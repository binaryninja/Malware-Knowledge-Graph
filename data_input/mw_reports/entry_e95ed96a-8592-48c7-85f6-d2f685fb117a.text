Introduction
When malware wants to communicate home, most use domain names, allowing them to
resolve host names to IP addresses of their servers. In order to increase the likelihood of
their malware successfully communicating home, cyber espionage threat actors are
increasingly abusing legitimate web services, in lieu of DNS lookups to retrieve a
command and control address. This negates the requirement to make DNS requests for
domains that may be considered malicious and are therefore blocked. For attackers,
that’s an advantage because it allows their initial communications channel to be
obscured amongst other trafﬁc to legitimate services.
This blog post examines two similar malware families that utilize the aforementioned
technique to abuse legitimate websites, their connections to each other, and their
connections to known espionage campaigns. The ﬁrst of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_A’,
a malware family that has links to a series of attacks associated with a backdoor attack
method commonly known as SNEEPY (aka ByeByeShell) ﬁrst reported by Rapid7 in
2013. The second of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_B’, which has a loose link to the series
of attacks associated with Operation Patchwork and The Hangover Report.

Confucius says… resolve your command and control domains
using web services.
In 2013, Rapid7 reported on a series of relatively amateur attacks against Pakistani
targets. For a long time after the report was published, little changed in how the
attackers operated. Although many of the attacks we see today from the group remain
the same, we began observing a new backdoor, CONFUCIUS_A, being dropped by the
attackers starting in early 2014. Speciﬁcally, the command and control addresses used
across multiple SNEEPY samples were being used by CONFUCIUS_A samples. In the
case of just one or two samples, without temporal overlap, this may not be deemed a
strong link to CONFUCIUS_A, however it occurs across a great deal of the infrastructure
we have observed.
In most cases where we have been able to identify the droppers, the attack begins with
an executable ﬁle being sent directly to targets via e-mail. Occasionally the attackers
leverage builders for known document exploits, but most of the time they still use selfextracting binaries. The themes of the phishing e-mails vary according to the target, but
invariably the ﬁle is compiled with an icon that matches the expected content. Examples
of the themes used in attacks using CONFUCIUS_A and the surrounding cluster of
activity include:

Invitations to events relevant to the recipients
Pornographic material
Fake updates to popular software products
News content
Political content
We have limited evidence of who the targets are, but they appear to primarily be based
in the Middle East and parts of Asia, with a focus on Pakistan. In addition to those
targets, there are occasional targets seen at enterprises across the globe.
Early samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware did not use any legitimate web services
for DNS resolution; however, more recent samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware use
a range of legitimate web services to resolve command and control addresses, the
highest proﬁle of which are Yahoo and Quora. The malware was given its name based
on the content of one of the ﬁrst pages we saw being retrieved to determine a command
and control address, which is written in the style of a ‘Confucius says’ joke. See Figure 1.

Figure 1 – An example of Quora page contacted by the malware.
Sometimes malware communicates with legitimate web services simply to perform a
connectivity check, but in this case the page was too speciﬁc to suggest that was what
the attackers were doing. So we decided to investigate how the malware processed the
resulting content.

If this is the question, what is the answer?
For the purposes of illustrating how the command and control address is decoded we will
look at the sample with SHA256:
a21b956e1be9dcfa8a28c38dc0bb0657508b5588bcf1435052700aea22910d7d. This
sample of the malware requests the page shown below in order to determine what IP to
POST to.

Figure 2 – The Quora page contacted by the malware to retrieve its command and
control address.
Reading through the answer, it all makes sense until the section highlighted is reached.
By looking at the underlying code, we found that CONFUCIUS_A is looking for keywords
between the phrases “suggested options are” and “hope it will help” and decoding the
interim phrase. The decoding is done using a simple lookup table, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 – A memory dump from a CONFUCIUS_A sample showing the lookup table
used by the malware, the table is truncated for presentation purposes.

The lookup table begins with the marker for the beginning and end of the useful content,
and then contains 255 words, each of which corresponds to a number (for example
prudent == 255). Using this lookup table in memory it can then derive the command and
control address from the text between the markers, “ﬁll plate clever road” becomes
91.210.107[.]104.

Figure 4 – HTTP POST request made to command and control server

Additional malware contacting Yahoo and Quora
During our investigation into the CONFUCIUS_A malware, one of the ways we tried to
identify variations of the backdoor was by looking for samples that communicated with
the same legitimate services as known CONFUCIUS_A samples. In doing so, we
encountered another set of samples exhibiting very similar behavior, which we refer to as
CONFUCIUS_B, due to their similarity, and their likely similar origins. Unfortunately, we
have fewer details about how CONFUCIUS_B malware is delivered or the targets it
intends to hit.
For the purposes of this write-up we will follow the chain of dropped ﬁles from the
dropper with SHA256:
627724fa447e3937f3cdc5388285935a52d6970a616f4ac3d02e583d160cbfc0.

Enter CONFUCIUS_B…
At ﬁrst glance CONFUCIUS_B looks very similar to CONFUCIUS_A, and they are also
packaged in plain SFX binary ﬁles. The CONFUCIUS_B executable is disguised as a
PowerPoint presentation, using a Right-To-Left-Override (RTLO) trick and a false icon.
When executed, the self-extracting RAR package drops four ﬁles to the %AppData%
folder, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 – The ﬁles dropped by CONFUCIUS_B
Fancy.vbs executes fancy.bat, which in turn opens the presentation and runs the second
stage executable svchost.exe. As with CONFUCIUS_A, the initial beacons from this
svchost.exe are also to Yahoo and Quora, but the pages contacted, whilst odd did not
contain any obvious markers, rather they appeared to be entirely gibberish:

Figure 6 – An exemplary Quora page contacted by the malware.
So far, the execution chain, involving an SFX RAR and multiple scripts is similar to some
samples of SNEEPY, which we associate with CONFUCIUS_A, but this is where the
similarities between CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B begin to diverge. Svchost.exe
has a custom obfuscation scheme not seen in CONFUCIUS_A. This obfuscation allows
us to quickly identify all of the CONFUCIUS_B variants; their hashes are included at the
end of this post. The obfuscation routine is given in Figure 7.

Underneath that custom obfuscation lies a UPX packed executable which contains the
Yahoo and Quora functionality that originally piqued our interest. After unpacking the
UPX code, we began reverse engineering the resulting binary to see how
CONFUCIUS_B interacted with the Yahoo and Quora pages it initially requested. We
discovered that CONFUCIUS_B pieces together its DNS resolution from keywords in the
Yahoo and Quora posts similar to that of CONFUCIUS_A.
CONFUCIUS_B takes certain keywords in the Quora and Yahoo pages and applies
them to a lookup table in memory. Using that lookup table an IP address to POST to is
derived. The way this is done can be seen in a memory dump from the running process
when it contacts a relevant address, for example as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 – A memory dump of a CONFUCIUS_B illustrating the lookup table and initial
beacon address.
The lookup table takes key words and assigns them numbers, or a ‘.’ character, in order
to build an IP address, and is arranged as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 – Lookup table used by the malware to determine it’s command and control
address.
By applying the lookup table to the Quora page shown in Figure 6, we can derive the IP
the malware will POST to next for further communications.

Using our lookup table, giving us an address of 149.202.110[.]2:

This method of substituting words for components of an IP address, and the repeat use
of Yahoo and Quora are novel, which suggest it is likely that the same malware author,
or group of malware authors, authored both backdoors.

Link to Patchwork and test samples
The domain “com-account-jfnjkr[.]xyz” is linked to the CONFUCIUS_B attacks as it was a
C2 for the sample
c975954fbb473ed8ce3a98ca2c4977bf22d2413db01eda87599524969565836f, which
downloads CONFUCIUS_B. On May 24, 2016, the same domain hosted the sample
8cfd559756630d967bb597b087af98adc75895a1ec52586d53a2d898e4a6e9b0; a basic
ﬁle stealer malware associated with the Patchwork attackers, via a shared mutex:
{9754893678976458374658764387563876}.
All of the CONFUCIUS_B samples share the same mutex, “rCkBs1Uj493NaMXYY1LZ”.
Pivoting through samples in Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we were able to ﬁnd what
appears to be an early test sample of the malware that creates the same mutex; the
SHA256 of the sample is
0bd7db12ba8d9ce9d29983ef76205864dce146eb14cebe32a3431f994cc770ee. We
believe it is a test sample, as the conﬁgured command and control domain for this
sample is ‘breachframework[.]com’. This can also be linked back to known
CONFUCIUS_B sample via a shared SSL certiﬁcate. Breachframework[.]com previously
resolved to 5.135.85[.]16, which used the certiﬁcate

f6438919d27d08aa545e2f90b58d445cccac6c09, the same certiﬁcate was used by
104.23.35[.]15, a known command and control address for CONFUCIUS_B. These
relationships are summarized in Figure 9.

Figure 9 – An overview of the link to the test infrastructure.

Conclusion
In this blog post, we discussed two separate malware variations that behave in very
similar ways and use similar techniques to acquire a C2 address, with both using Yahoo
Answers and Quora to evade traditional mechanisms for blocking command and control
domains. Although we cannot link the two clusters of activity by their infrastructure, the
technique used to resolve domains is unusual. We also believe that both clusters of
activity have links to attacks with likely Indian origins, the CONFUCIUS_A attacks are
linked to the use of SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL and the CONFUCIUS_B have a loose link
to Hangover. The two malware families themselves are also very similar, and therefore
we think that the shared technique is an indication of a single developer, or development
company, behind both CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B. It is likely that the two
clusters of activity are operated by two different operators; however, as the command
and control infrastructure used by each cluster differs in the choices of hosting providers.
