Sidewalk Malware

Symantec, part of Broadcom Software, has linked the recently discovered Sidewalk
backdoor to the China-linked Grayfly espionage group. The malware, which is related to the
older Crosswalk backdoor (Backdoor.Motnug) has been deployed in recent Grayfly
campaigns against a number of organizations in Taiwan, Vietnam, the United States, and
Mexico. A feature of this recent campaign was that a large number of targets were in the
telecoms sector. The group also attacked organizations in the IT, media, and finance sectors.
Sidewalk was recently documented by ESET, who attributed it to a new group it called
SparklingGoblin, which it linked to the Winnti malware family. Symantec’s Threat Hunter
Team has attributed Sidewalk to Grayfly, a longstanding Chinese espionage operation.
Members of the group were indicted in the U.S. in 2020. The recent campaign involving
Sidewalk suggests that Grayfly has been undeterred by the publicity surrounding the
indictments.

Who are Grayfly?
Grayfly (aka GREF and Wicked Panda) is a targeted attack group that has been active since
at least March 2017 using a custom backdoor known as Backdoor.Motnug (aka
TOMMYGUN/CROSSWALK), a custom loader called Trojan.Chattak, Cobalt Strike (aka
Trojan.Agentemis), and ancillary tools in its attacks.
Grayfly has been observed targeting a number of countries in Asia, Europe, and North
America across a variety of industries, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality,
manufacturing, and telecommunications. In more recent activity, Grayfly has continued with
its focus on telecommunications but has also been observed targeting organizations
operating within the media, finance, and IT service provider sectors. Typically Grayfly targets
publicly facing web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion, before spreading further
within the network.
Once a network has been compromised, Grayfly may install its custom backdoors onto
additional systems. These tools allow the attackers to have comprehensive remote access to
the network and proxy connections allowing them to access hard-to-reach segments of a
target's network.
Although sometimes labeled APT41, we consider Grayfly the espionage arm of APT41.
Similarly, Symantec tracks other sub-groups of APT41 separately, such as Blackfly, its cybercrime arm.

Sidewalk campaign
A characteristic of the recent campaign was that the group appeared to be particularly
interested in attacking exposed Microsoft Exchange or MySQL servers. This suggests that
the initial vector may be the exploit of multiple vulnerabilities against public-facing servers.
In at least one attack, the suspicious Exchange activity was followed by PowerShell
commands used to install an unidentified web shell. Following this, the malicious backdoor
was executed.
After the installation of the backdoor, the attackers deployed a custom version of the
credential-dumping tool Mimikatz. This version of Mimikatz has been used previously in
Grayfly attacks.

Victim case study
The first indication of attacker activity was identified at 20:39 local time, where a Base64encoded PowerShell command was executed via a legitimate Exchange Server-related
process. The command was used to execute certutil to decode and install a web shell:

>(^_certutil -decode -f C:\Windows\Temp\ImportContactList_-.aspx
C:\Windows\Temp\ImportContactList.aspx;if((dir
C:\Windows\Temp\ImportContactList.aspx).Length -eq 212){Remove-Item -Force
C:\Windows\Temp\ImportContactList_*-*.aspx}*

Next, another Base64-encoded PowerShell command was executed. This command was
used to move the web shell to the Exchange install path, accessible by the attackers –
specifically the ClientAccess\ecp directory.
mv C:\Windows\Temp\ImportContactList.aspx
$envExchangeInstallPath\ClientAccess\esp\ -Force
Several minutes later, a backdoor was executed via installutil.exe:
CSIDL_WINDOWS\microsoft.net\framework64\v4.0.30319\installutil.exe /logfile=
/LogToConsole=false /ParentProc=none /U
CSIDL_WINDOWS\microsoft.net\framework64\v4.0.30319\microsoft.webapi.config
Roughly an hour later, the attackers were observed executing a WMIC command in order to
run a Windows batch file. This file was used to create a scheduled task to execute the
backdoor and ensure persistence:
WMIC /NODE:&quot;172.16.140.234&quot; process call create &quot;cmd.exe /c
c:\users\public\schtask.bat&quot;
Shortly after this, Mimikatz was executed to dump credentials:
sha2:b3eb783b017da32e33d19670b39eae0b11de8e983891dd4feb873d6e9333608d
(Mimikatz) - csidl_system_drive\perflogs\ulsassx64.exe
After this point, no further activity was observed.

Indictments
Three Chinese men were indicted in the U.S. in 2020 for their involvement in attacks that
involved Grayfly tools and tactics. At the time of the indictment, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and
Fu Qiang were based in the Chinese city of Chengdu and held senior positions in a company
called Chengdu 404. The company describes itself as a network security specialist and
claims to employ a team of white hat hackers who can perform penetration testing along with
other security operations.
The indictment charged the men with involvement in attacks against over 100 different
organizations in the U.S., South Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and
Thailand. Jiang was said to have a “working relationship” with the Chinese Ministry of State
Security which would provide him and his associates with a degree of state protection.

Likely to continue
Grayfly is a capable actor, likely to continue to pose a risk to organizations in Asia and
Europe across a variety of industries, including telecommunications, finance, and media. It's
likely this group will continue to develop and improve its custom tools to enhance evasion
tactics along with using commodity tools such as publicly available exploits and web shells to
assist in their attacks.
