Threat Actors Leveraging Microsoft Applications to Deliver Cobalt-Strike
Beacons
DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) sideloading is a technique used by Threat Actors to infect users using
legitimate applications which load malicious DLL files that spoof legitimate ones. Recently Cyble
Research Labs published a blog about Qakbot malware that leverages a calculator to perform DLL
Sideloading.
Similarly, we came across a Twitter post wherein researchers mentioned a document file that performs
DLL Sideloading using Microsoft applications such as “Teams.exe” and “OneDrive.exe.” The dropped
DLL contains the C&C URL through which the malware can deliver a Cobalt-Strike beacon.
Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing product that allows Threat Actors (TAs) to deploy an agent named
‘Beacon’ on the victim machine. The Beacon provides various functionalities to TAs, including command
execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning, and
lateral movement.

Several TAs are actively using this tool, from ransomware operators to espionage-focused Advanced
Persistent Threats (APTs).
Upon analyzing the malicious doc file, we observed that it was targeting a company located in Italy that
provides services such as Credit Servicing, Fund and Asset Management, and Real Estate services.
The below figure shows the malicious document file content.

Figure 1 – Document with Macro Content

Technical Analysis
When opening the malicious document, it shows a security warning stating that macros have been
disabled. The malware then requests the user to enable the content. Once enabled, the malicious
document runs the macro code automatically in the background using the AutoOpen() function.

AutoOpen() function in Macro
The malware then calls the function process(), which identifies the path of the OneDrive and Teams
applications. The below figure shows the VBA macro code with the base64 decoded path of the
OneDrive and Teams applications.

Figure 3 – Path identification to Drop DLL file
In the event that any of the application’s paths are identified by the malicious document, the malware
drops a DLL file in that path with the name cache-XJDNSJWPFHD.tmp and renames it as iphlpapi.dll by
calling the EnableContent() function as shown below.

The document file contains an embedded DLL file in reversed Base64 encoded format. The malware
then calls the GetParagraph() function, which gets the Base64 encoded strings and performs the
StrReverse and Base64Decode operations to drop the malicious DLL file in the location where the
OneDrive and Team applications are present.

The below figure shows the malicious DLL file dropped in the Teams and OneDrive locations.

Upon execution of the Teams application, the dropped malicious DLL file (“iphlpapi.dll”) is sideloaded, as
shown below.

Payload Analysis
The below figure shows the code of sideloaded DLL malware, which creates a mutex with the name
“MSTeams.Synchronization.Primitive.2.0″ to avoid running another instance on the same machine. The
malware then communicates to the C&C server using the below URL:
d2xiq5m2a8wmm4.cloudfront[.]net/communications.

While monitoring the malware’s traffic, we observed the C&C communication with the same URL
mentioned above.

Figure 9 – Traffic Interception
After analysing the C&C URL: d2xiq5m2a8wmm4.cloudfront[.]net/communications, we concluded that it
executes a Cobalt-Strike on the victim’s machine.
The Cobalt-Strike Beacon can be used for malicious activities such as downloading additional payloads,
lateral movement, etc.

Conclusion
TAs are adopting various sophisticated techniques to deploy malware. In this particular case, we
observed how TAs are using Microsoft apps such as Teams and OneDrive to sideload a malicious library
file that can deploy the Cobalt Strike Beacon.
Cyble Research Labs continuously monitors all new and existing malware to keep our readers aware
and informed.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Avoid downloading files from unknown websites.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links, email attachments, or unknown document files without
verifying their authenticity.
Educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solution on the employees’ systems.
