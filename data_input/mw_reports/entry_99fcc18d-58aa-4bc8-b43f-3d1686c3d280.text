Warning: GRIM and Magnus Android Botnets are
Underground

April 29, 2022

The lifecycle of an Android banking botnet typically consists of two stages: rise and fall.
During the rising phase, the malware author promotes their new code and rents it
underground—MaaS (Malware as a Service). As the botnet gains popularity, it evolves with
new features and pricing. At some point, though, an issue occurs, triggering its fall. For
example, the author gets caught (e.g Anubis) or its source code gets released on
underground forums (either willingly by the authors themselves, by a competitor, or perhaps
an unhappy customer). As a result, the botnet gradually dies. And unfortunately, others pop
up on the market to take its place.
As malware analysts, the Android/Marcher, Locker, and Anubis malware we used to see
have been replaced by BianLian, Cerberos, and Flubot (and still Anubis). A year ago, threat
actor(s) started advertising a newcomer, the Huracan botnet. We haven’t seen it in the wild

yet—or if we have, we haven’t recognized it (it’s not always obvious to match underground
names with the samples we analyze).
Since the beginning of 2022, there are even more newcomers. I have spotted at least
two future banking botnets: GRIM and Magnus. You should be keep an eye on those
two, as they will probably emerge in the wild in the next few months.

Underground advertisement
The Magnus Botnet has been repeatedly advertised underground by a threat actor named
whit3_d3vil since February 2022. It is unclear whether whi3_d3vil is the author or just a
reseller. The botnet implements all the typical features that banking trojans currently have:
overlay injection over mobile banking applications, sending SMS, SMS interception, 2FA
bypass, remote administration via VNC, etc. And unlike BianLian, communication with C2s
is encrypted using AES.

The botnet can be rented for 1,000 USD per month.
Should we be amused or anxious that malware are being sold like boxes of cookies on the
web? There are even sales (prices marked down from 1,600 USD to 1,000 USD),
watermarked screenshots (against competitors?), and videos demonstrating the product!

The Grim botnet is less expensive: only 500 USD/month. It is being advertised on a
specialized Telegram channel. It implements more or less the same features as the Magnus
bot. Prices for underground botnet packages are freely fixed by the authors/resellers. They
don’t necessarily match features. A lower price for Grimbot can mean the malware has less
notoriety, for instance, rather than fewer features.

various mobile banking apps (targets)

How does this concern me?
If you are a malware analyst, be on the lookout for a new banking botnet whose
communication with its C2 is encrypted with AES (Magnus) or a botnet with tags such
as “grim” that poses as a “Security” application.
Fortunately, if you are protected by Fortiguard Antivirus (e.g. FortiGate, FortiClient, FortiMail,
FortiWeb, FortiProxy), you are automatically protected against many Android banking
trojans.

However, there are a few other precautions you should take:
1. Android banking trojans typically pose as famous applications: Video Player, Play
Store, Flash Player, etc. Be sure to download such applications only from a trusted
marketplace. Never follow a link (email or SMS) to download the app, even if it
comes from a presumed friend. Important: Note that banking trojans do not usually
pose as a mobile banking app. Rather, they pose as another app, detect when you use
your (genuine) mobile banking app, and display (overlay) malicious windows on top of
the real ones.
2. All those banking trojans also abuse Android Accessibility Services. Accessibility
Services are meant to help people with disabilities. Do not grant such rights to any
other application!
Figure 4: This is the standard alert screen on Android that shows when an application tries to
use Accessibility Services. You should **not** accept this. Instead, click Cancel immediately,
uninstall the corresponding app, and scan your smartphone
Figure 5: This screen is a very good indicator of an infection by Android/BianLian. Do not
activate accessibility services! Uninstall the application immediately and scan your
smartphone for viruses with AV for higher security
