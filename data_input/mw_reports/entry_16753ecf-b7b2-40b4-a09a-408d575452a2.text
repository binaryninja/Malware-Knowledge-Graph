In mid-May 2021, experts from SOLAR JSOC and the National Computer Incident Response
& Coordination Center (NCIRCC) released a joint report on a series of targeted attacks
detected in 2020. According to the report, the attackers targeted Russian federal executive
authorities.
While analyzing the report, Anastasia Tikhonova (Head of APT Research at Group-IB) and
Dmitry Kupin (Senior Malware Analyst) noticed that they had already come across similar
tools in earlier attacks.

Chinese APTs are one of the most numerous and aggressive hacker communities. Several
dozen groups conduct attacks in countries all over the world, and Russia is no exception.
Hackers mostly target state agencies, industrial facilities, military contractors, and research
institutes. The main objective is espionage: attackers gain access to confidential data and
attempt to hide their presence for as long as possible. There have been cases when
attackers successfully persisted in the victim's network for several years.
Unfortunately, the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report did not provide indicators of
compromise, so the experts had to rely on descriptions of the functionality and screenshots
of the malicious code. As a result, Group-IB's researchers came up with some interesting
conclusions about which Chinese groups could be behind the attacks against Russian
federal executive authorities in 2020, what tools they used, and how their malware has
evolved since.
Key conclusions
The research describes Webdav-O malware detected in attacks against Russian federal
executive authorities in 2020.
Group-IB experts detected two versions of the Webdav-O Trojan for x86 and x64 systems.
When comparing parts of the code, the specialists proved that the Webdav-O x64 Trojan was
used in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities. The malware has existed since
at least 2018.
Group-IB specialists established that Webdav-O has a set of commands similar to a popular
Trojan called BlueTraveller (aka RemShell), which was developed in China and has been
linked to the hacker group called TaskMasters.
Before that, Sentinel Labs released a report about malware called Mail-O, which was also
identified in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities. Mail-O was deemed to be
linked to the Chinese hacker group TA428.
Group TA428 is known to use a Trojan called Albaniiutas in their attacks. Group-IB's analysis
showed that Albaniiutas is an updated version of BlueTraveller.
Group-IB experts believe that either both Chinese hacker groups (TA428 and TaskMasters)
attacked Russian federal executive authorities in 2020 or that there is one united Chinese
hacker group made up of different units.
TA428 is a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group that has been operating since 2013. The
attackers target a number of government agencies in East Asia that control governmental
information technology, domestic and foreign policy, and economic development.
TaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller) is a state-sponsored Chinese hacker group that allegedly
has been active since at least 2010. The group attacks companies based in several
4/31

countries, but many of their targets are located in Russia and CIS. The hackers target solid
industrial and energy enterprises, government agencies, and transport companies.
Starting point
As the experts put it: "The report dwells on the analysis of a series of targeted attacks".
Based on this information, we assumed that several hacker groups may be behind the
attacks.

The attackers used malware that interacted with management server via the cloud
service called Yandex.Disk. The malware was dubbed Webdav-O.

Attackers also used malicious software that accessed the cloud service Mail.ru. The
malware was dubbed Mail-O.

In early June 2021, analysts from the American cybersecurity company Sentinel Labs
released a report about Mail-O. The experts wrote that Mail-O is a version of the relatively
well-known malware called SManager, which is used by the Chinese hacker group TA428.
Group-IB specialists wanted to make sure that Mail-O is loader, while Smanager and
Tmanger are Remote Access Trojans (RAT). However, a part of the code overlaps in the
exported functions "Entery" and "ServiceMain" of Mail-O, SManager and Tmanger, which
brings us back to TA428. Moreover, hackers from TA428 have already been found to be
involved in espionage against Russia, especially Russian state facilities.
To prove the hypothesis that TA428 was behind the attacks against Russian federal
executive authorities in 2020, we decided to analyze a sample of Webdav-O. Group-IB
Threat Intelligence & Attribution has detected similar malicious behavior before and can now
explain why we link it to a specific group. Below we provide an analysis of Webdav-O
samples and highlight features that overlap with the points mentioned in the SOLAR JSOC
and NCIRCC report.

Analysis of Webdav-O sample
File "1.dll" is an x86 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the system.
The analyzed file provides remote access to the command line shell (cmd.exe) and executes
various commands originating from C2 on the compromised host.
5/31

The legitimate cloud service called Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is used as network
infrastructure, namely C&C. Network interaction with the cloud is implemented via the
Webdav protocol. The authentication method is Basic.
The strings and configuration data are encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using the following
key: { 8A 4F 01 47 34 C9 75 F8 2B C8 C1 E9 D2 F3 A5 8B }. The key size is 16 bytes. The
analyzed files can work with 1-7 accounts (in this case only 2 are used, but we will come
back to this later).
Features of the sample

The exported ServiceMain function uses a random delay before the main code is executed.
01

6/31

Yandex.Disk cloud accounts are checked for availability using the query "/?userinfo" (GET).
02

The file "/test3.txt" is uploaded from "Yandex.Disk" (GET) and checked for the "Just A Test!"
line. In case of success, the system checks for batch files in the "/test" directory of
"Yandex.Disk" (PROFIND).
03

7/31

A command file is defined for downloading from the Yandex.Disk cloud (GET). The response
from the server is processed. The name of the file with commands is between the tags:
<d:href>[name of the command file]</d:href>
04
In the command file, the contents are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. After downloading
the command file, it is deleted from Yandex.Disk (DELETE).

05

The file "/test2.txt" is uploaded to Yandex.Disk (PUT). The file "/test2.txt" contains the line
"Just A Test!". The mechanism is presumably used to check the functioning of a malicious
program.
06
The file "/test2/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin" is uploaded to "Yandex.Disk" (PUT). The file contains
the command results. Data is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm.

Description of the commands
Comparison with the sample presented in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report
When analyzing the code uploaded to VirusTotal, we found many overlapping points with the
Trojan described in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report. Some of the common features
can be seen in the screenshot with the malware code, which shows the receipt of the

As you can see from our comparison of the two samples, Webdav-O from the SOLAR JSOC
and NCIRCC report looks like a newer, partially improved version of the Trojan that we
detected on VirusTotal.

Based on a large database of analyzed malicious samples accumulated when searching and
responding to cyber threats, Group-IB's specialists linked the detected Webdav-O sample to
the BlueTraveller Trojan.

11/31

To prove our hypothesis, below we present a comparison of the Webdav-O x86 sample and
the sample of BlueTraveller (RemShell) (SHA1:
6857BB2C3AE5F9C2393D9F88816BE7A10CB5573F).

Let's go back to the analyzed sample of Webdav-O x86. When we decrypted the malware
string, we found the following "login:password" for the attacker's accounts used on
Yandex.Disk.

13/31

The data discovered:
aleshaadams:7ujm!QAZ2wsx

tstrobos:&UJM1qaz2ws

If the account login is known, it is possible to recover the email address as follows:
tstrobos@yandex.ru

aleshaadams@yandex.ru

Attempt to recover the password for aleshaadams@yandex.ru
Attempt to recover the password for tstrobos@yandex.ru

14/31

The screenshots show that both accounts are linked to cellphone numbers in the same
region (+86), which is the country code for China.

Analysis of password generation
In 2019, Elmar Nabigaev (Deputy Director of Expert Security Center Positive Technologies)
delivered a report entitled "The TaskMasters APT" (aka BlueTraveller) and gave examples
of passwords discovered when investigating the malware campaign:

The images above show that the passwords to the Webdav-O account were generated using
a similar technique as TaskMasters. The only things that changed were the registry and the
key row combination.
Blurring the boundaries
Considering all the comparisons made and the information discovered about the accounts,
we believe that the Chinese hacker group TaskMasters is most likely behind the attacks
involving an improved version of the Webdav-O Trojan. The case of TA428, however, is still
15/31

open to debate. Could both of them be behind the attack against Russian federal executive
authorities in 2020? Could there be someone else involved? Or was it the same group?
We will continue our investigation and seek more information for analysis. Let us take a look
at the report about TA428 and their new tools, in particular the Trojan called Albaniiutas,
which was released by NTT Security Corporation in 2020.

Executing Albaniiutas files, NTT report
The aim of our investigation is to study these two objects. Our reasoning will be presented
below.
First and foremost, we discovered some common points in the utility used to launch DLL:
Code parts of both utilities show the similarities in more detail. As can be seen, both samples
use XOR encryption, which even displays identical debugging information.

Fragments of code encrypted with XOR and debugging lines in BlueTraveller (on the left)
and Albaniiutas (on the right)

Moreover, there are common points at the stage of establishing persistence in the system.
The screenshots below show that the same DLL name randomization occurs. The same
description of the service under which this DLL will work is also displayed.

Albaniiutas (on the right)
Let's continue our comparative analysis and take a look at a sample of BlueTraveller
(SHA1:6857BB2C3AE5F9C2393D9F88816BE7A10CB5573F) and a fileless RAT belonging
to the Albaniiutas family.
We also analyzed code parts that look very similar. For example, part of the pseudocode for
executing commands in the command line shell (cmd.exe) is shown below.

17/31

Fragments of the code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)

Next, we analyzed the code parts of data processing received from the C&C server:

Fragments of the code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)

The parts of code above show that the code in BlueTraveller is less sophisticated, but in both
cases the separator "\b" is used three times (the strtok function). Below is an example of the
data that Albaniiutas malware receives for each command:

18/31

Format of the data received when executing commands (retrieved from the NTT report)
1
If the command is executed multiple times, the command will not be executed unless a value
other than the previous one is specified.
2
Separator
3
If the value does not match the value in ③, the command will not be executed.
4
Command identifier and command parameters separated by spaces.
Let's also compare the code fragments for checking and executing the commands received
from the C&C server:

Fragments of code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)
It is clear that this part was updated by the hackers, but the commands remain the same:

19/31

In addition, the two Trojans have a similar pattern of communicating with the control server in
the protocols of network interaction with the C&C server. Below is an example of network
communication with the C&C server, taken from BlueTraveller samples available on
VirusTotal.
Let's move on to string obfuscation in Albaniiutas. We have established that strings are
encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. The encryption key used is
L!Q@W#E$R%T^Y&U*A|}t~k.
The same encryption key was used in the BlueTraveller server component which stores the
log files in the encrypted form:

A fragment of code with a line written to a log file (retrieved from PTSecurity "Operation
TaskMasters" 2019)

20/31

The conclusion is clear: Albaniiutas is nothing but a logic continuation of the malware
belonging to the BlueTraveller family.
And then it dawned on us…
We thought that we had analyzed everything and that we were done with comparisons, when
suddenly a sample was uploaded to VirusTotal. We identified it as Webdav-O.
The file "y_dll.dll" is an x64 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the
system.
As can be seen, this version of Webdav-O was written for a system with a different bitness
and compiled later than our sample of Webdav-O x86 (2018-12 and 2018-07, respectively).
The legitimate cloud service Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is also used as a network
infrastructure, in particular C2. Network interaction with the cloud is carried out via a Webdav
protocol.
However, this sample supports two authentication methods instead of one in Webdav-O x86:
Basic (with a username and password) and OAuth (using a token).
The strings and configuration data are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm with the following
key: { C3 02 03 04 05 DD EE 08 09 10 11 12 1F D2 15 16 }. The key size is 16 bytes. The
analyzed file can work with 1-7 accounts (it works with only one in this case).
This sample seemed even more similar to the one described in the SOLAR JSOC and
NCIRCC report: unlike our sample, it has the "-sleepuntil" function.
Unfortunately colleagues at SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC did not provide any indicators of
compromise, so we can only make comparisons based on screenshots and descriptions of
the capabilities of their sample.

Webdav-O sample from the report and Webdav-O x64 sample

21/31

Webdav-O sample from the report and Webdav-O x64 sample (processing the -sleepuntil
command)
The parts of code presented above show that both versions look identical. Group-IB experts
also noticed that in Webdav-O x64, the commands and their results are transferred by
uploading various files to Yandex.Disk:
Description of files created by Webdav-O from the report:
test2.txt, test3.txt. are files used to check the connection
test4.txt contains information about the interval (minutes) between command requests
to the server
test5.txt contains the launch date for the malware
test7.txt is uploaded to the server and contains a 16-byte RC4 key that is used to
encrypt commands and their results (the key is also encrypted with a public RSA key)
test is a directory containing files that are downloaded, decrypted, and processed as
commands. Malware receives the file list via the PROPFIND request and by parsing
the necessary tags: <d:href>complete path to file</d:href>.
Description of the files created by Webdav-O x64:
The data presented above shows that this part is also identical except for the description of
test6.txt, which is not presented in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report.
Based on the comparisons above, Group-IB experts have concluded that this particular
Webdav-O sample was most likely used in attacks on Russian federal executive authorities
in 2020 and it is the same Trojan as the one described in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC
report.
To sum up...

Venn diagram showing the common points between the two Trojans
(Only data presented in the blog is used in the diagram)
Webdav-O malware is a version of the BlueTraveller (RemShell) Trojan, which is classified
as a Chinese APT. Webdav-O was designed for both x86 and x64 systems.
Webdav-O may have been used by the Chinese APT TaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller).
Based on the information about attacks on various federal executive authorities in 2020,
presented in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRC report, it is possible that in some cases the
Chinese APT TA428 was behind the attacks, while others could have been performed by
TaskMasters.
23/31

Researchers from SentinelLabs have linked Mail-O to Smanager and Tmanger (tools used
by TA428). Group-IB specialists found common code parts in the malware's exported
functions "Entery" and "ServiceMain". We can say with moderate confidence that Mail-O was
developed by TA428.
Based on research done by NTT Security, it can be said that TA428 has already used the
malware Albaniiutas. Group-IB experts have shown that the Trojan is a new version of
BlueTraveller (RemShell). As such, it can be assumed that Webdav-O is also linked to
TA428.
It is noteworthy that Chinese hacker groups actively exchange tools and infrastructure, but
perhaps it is just the case here.
There is also strong evidence that points to one large hacker group consisting of several
intelligence units of the People's Liberation Army of China. For example, unit 61398 from
Shanghai is responsible for the actions of a well-known group called APT1 (aka Comment
Crew), and unit 61419 from Qingdao has been linked to Tick. Each unit attacks to the fullest,
according to a strict timeline and order. This means that one Trojan can be configured and
modified by hackers from different departments with different levels of training and with
various objectives.
