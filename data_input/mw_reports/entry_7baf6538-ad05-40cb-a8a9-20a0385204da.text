Key Take Aways
The first Linux version of ChaChi, a Golang based DNS tunneling backdoor, was recently observed on VirusTotal.
The malware is configured to use domains associated with ransomware actors known as PYSA, aka Menipoza
Ransomware Gang.
PYSA’s ChaChi infrastructure appears to have been largely dormant for the past several weeks, mostly parked
and apparently no longer operational.
We assess with moderate confidence this sample represents the PYSA actor expanding into targeting Linux
hosts with ChaChi backdoor.

Background
Ransomware is quickly expanding into Linux and Cloud networks as threat actors evolve their campaigns. For
example, in recent weeks the BlackMatter ransomware gang, HelloKitty ransomware, and REvil ransomware were first
observed expanding into Linux targeting through ESXi servers with ELF encryptors. Ransomware shifts to Linux
targeting is an important trend to observe. Threat actors continue to evolve their campaigns by targeting Linux and
cloud-centric networks.

Analysis
In August of 2021, Lacework Labs identified a Linux variant (MD5: 14abd57e8eb06191f12c0d84f9c1470b) of ChaChi.
ChaChi refers to a customized variant of an open-source Golang based RAT that leverages DNS tunneling for C2
communication. The specimen was configured with domains that were reported by Palo Alto Networks in July:

sbvjhs.club

While the specimen was recently observed, it was uploaded to VirusTotal June 14th 2021, and only had 1/61 AV
detections at the time. Following our tweet in late August, and as of this writing, it’s currently at a 20/61 detection rate.

Figure 1. AV detection over time
The Linux variant shares characteristics with its Windows counterpart, most notable being core functionality, the large
file size (8MB +) and the use of Golang obfuscator Gobfuscate. A distinguishing characteristic of the Linux version was
the presence of debug output containing datetime data.

Figure 2. Debug Output
ChaChi leverages custom nameservers that double as C2s to support the DNS tunneling protocol. As such the C2
hosts can be identified with passive DNS analysis of the name server domains. Analysis shows that the majority of
ChaChi infrastructure has been parked or offline since 23-24 June 2021. The two exceptions to this appear to be
domains ns1.ccenter.tech and ns2.spm.best.

Figure 3. C2 Whois and nameservers example
At the time of this blog, two domains from the Linux variant (sbvjhs.xyz and sbvjhs.club) resolved to Amazon IP
address 99.83.154.118. This IP is an AWS Global accelerator host and has several AV detections on VirusTotal,
however, our analysis indicates this is most likely used by Namecheap for domain parking purposes and should not be
used as a ChaChi IOC. The following table lists known Chachi nameservers along with their resolutions. Several
domains have been parked on either Amazon or Namecheap but these were filtered out.

Conclusion
Many actors target multiple architectures to increase their footprint, so this may be the motive here and could
represent an evolution in PYSA operations. It is currently unclear if the Linux variant was used in operations, however
it was observed prior to the associated infrastructure going offline. The observed debug output however may indicate
the specimen is still in the testing phase.
Ransomware is hugely lucrative and actors are continuously looking for any edge that will increase their profits. While
ransomware activity involving Linux Servers and cloud infrastructure remains rare, it still poses a real threat to
business operations and customer data. Indicators for this activity are available on the Lacework Labs’s Github. If you
