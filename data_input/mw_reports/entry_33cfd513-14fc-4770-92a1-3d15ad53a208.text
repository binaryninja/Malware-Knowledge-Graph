Attackers in Executive Clothing - BEC continues to
separate orgs from their money

By Nick Biasini.
In today's world of threat research, the focus tends to be on the overtly malicious practice of
distributing and installing malware on end systems. But this is far from the complete picture
of what threats organizations face. One of the most, if not the most, costly is something far
less sophisticated: Business Email Compromise (BEC). BEC can take a wide array of
different forms, but its goal is relatively simple — trick an unsuspecting user into giving them
something. Lately, we've seen a recent rise in these types of attacks, with adversaries still
using COVID-19 as a major topic of lures to draw unsuspecting victims into turning over
important personal and financial information.
Looking at conservative estimates, business email compromise losses are in the billions,
with the FBI stating in 2020 alone the loses approached $1.8 Billion. This is an extremely
lucrative enterprise with a low barrier to entry. Other forms of cybercrime are tougher to enter
because the actor needs to source the malware they are going to distribute and have enough
knowledge to set up and run the associated infrastructure — or at the very least, pay
someone who does. At the very least, this takes a significant amount of time and effort,
where BEC removes the majority of those barriers.

Business Email Compromise starts as a lot of cybercrime does, with an email. These emails
can vary widely in content or in design, but they are almost always spoofed to look like they
are coming from someone important. The other common thing is they will almost always ask
for some type of assistance. The type of request varies widely, as we'll demonstrate
throughout this blog, but the resulting ask is always financial in nature and will require the
recipient to purchase something or wire funds somewhere. So let's walk through some
examples of what we've seen over the past year.

Gift card requests
The overwhelming majority of the BEC emails we've encountered over the last year revolve
around some sort of gift card purchase. The opening lines to these emails are typically
something like, "I need you help with a quick task," or "Do you have an amazon account ?"
These requests are also likely tied to some extraordinary event. Much of the time, it's a
surprise for employees or tied to some specific event, as the example below shows.

This is by far one of the most common ways we see BEC. These emails typically come from
a free email service (i.e. Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook) but spoofed to appear to be someone
important in the organization. The supposed position of the person within an organization
and the amount of detail can vary widely depending on the sophistication level of the
attacker. In this case, it's a relatively innocuous request to get a PlayStation gift card for an
executive's nephew. Also, it's commonly tied to something that will encourage you to have
sympathy for the challenges they are facing. In this case, it's due to a funeral for a close
friend of the alleged executive. The reasons for this are twofold: First, it creates some
sympathy from the victim to hopefully encourage them to help out. It also creates a narrative
where pushing back or questioning the request appears insensitive because of the sender's
current circumstances. This type of tactic is incredibly common and can get pretty
despicable, as we'll demonstrate later.
The types of gift cards these actors request fall into a few different categories. The most
common are iTunes or Google Play gift cards. This is a logical choice for adversaries, since
there is a huge market for these types of gift cards, as most people have smartphones today,
and monetization can occur quickly. Actors have a wide array of ways to re-sell these gift
cards on legitimate and illegitimate marketplaces.

2/10

However, we have seen a few other types of cards, one of which can be found in the
example above — PlayStation gift cards. Those, along with Amazon gift cards, make up the
overwhelming majority of the requests we've seen over the past year, but should not be
considered an exhaustive list.
The emails themselves are usually constructed in a very simple manner, with subjects
requesting help. Common examples include things like "Task," "Quick Favor" and "Hi,"
among many others. The subject and content are typically kept short and to the point, even
including indicators the email was sent from a mobile device like a tablet or smartphone. This
is done purposefully, as most individuals asking for this type of help aren't going to write
several paragraphs explaining their intentions and can be used as an explanation of why
they aren't using their corporate email.
The biggest difference between these types of emails and something like 419 scams — the
classic "Nigerian prince asking for money" scam — is that they are at least somewhat
targeted. The type and amount of targeting varies depending on the scenario. The most
common examples we see are directed at email addresses that are publicly available,
typically from a company webpage or directory, and they appear to originate from someone
else who also works at that company. The type of person can change from owners, to
executives, to directors. Regardless, it's someone with a management or ownership stake in
the company. The names of these individuals and their title is usually available on the
company website or elsewhere on the internet. Sometimes, the email can be spoofed to look
like it actually originates from that user, but more often than not, it's just a generic email
account that looks something like 'executivedirector155878@gmail[.]com' or
'lawfirm3053@outlook[.]com.'
The amount of and types of businesses that get targeted with these attacks is truly
staggering, ranging from huge multinational corporations down to small mom-and-pop
restaurants in U.S. cities. We found examples of small restaurants that are being targeted by
impersonating the owners, since the information was available on their website. These actors
are prolific and thorough with accurate impersonations for the large majority of the
campaigns we saw. We did notice that there were repeated attempts at some of the larger
targets, potentially demonstrating their value to criminals. These attempts typically attack
different users at the same organization with similar themes and the same director/executive
as the other messages.

COVID-19 impact
The themes for these campaigns were largely innocuous for a time. But just like every other
aspect of life, COVID-19 has had its effects. Beginning early in 2020, we started seeing
COVID being more actively integrated into these campaigns. The most common example
was a request for gift cards after the person in question was infected with COVID-19, an
example of which is below.

3/10

In this example, we can see the criminal is claiming to have been infected with COVID-19
and it's preventing them from being able to buy things. This is obviously a ridiculous claim,
but could work nonetheless.
These were not the only types of themes we saw associated with COVID. As time went on,
the ways bad actors tried to profit off the pandemic shifted to helping with those dealing with
losses.
One particular exchange started as most did with a simple request for help as many of these
campaigns do:
"How are you ? Hope you are keeping safe?. Are you available via email? I
need your help." [Sic]

This particular victim responded to the initial request with some information about vaccination
status and some projects they've been working on. Within hours, the criminal responded with
their plea for gift cards, but this time, pulling at heartstrings by discussing children losing
parents to COVID and adding sympathy for the elderly and ailing, as well:
Thanks for responding, Actually, I need to get GOOGLE PLAY GIFT CARDS for my Niece
who had Heart operation some days ago she had lost both parents to the disease (COVID19). It's her Birthday gift, but I can't do this right now because I have arthritis in the knees
and ankles. They are giving me problems. I am going up and down one step at a time. This
method is neither graceful! Or fast!, and I tried purchasing online but unfortunately no luck
with that. Can you get it from any store around you? I will reimburse you with the money
spent. kindly let me know if you can handle this. [Sic].
The criminal pulls out all the stops to get their payoff. Luckily, in this particular example, the
target realized the user was impersonating someone and no money was lost. Unfortunately,
that is not always the case. Amazingly, this wasn't the most heinous example of business
email compromise we found during our analysis. Below, there's an example of one of the
worst campaigns we observed.

Hi <Name>,
Are you available? I need your help, I'm giving out gift cards to the
hospice care unit for donation. Can you help me with some? You will be
reimbursed.
Thank you,
4/10

In this campaign, an executive is requesting the employee buy gift cards to hand out to a
hospice care unit. This truly shows there are no lows these actors won't sink to to try and
convince people to give in to their monetary demands. This is further illustrated by the
successful campaigns we've analyzed and the ways these actors typically operate.

Process
The way this works is incredibly simple and requires nothing more than some social
engineering skills and persistence to reach enough potential victims. We've walked through
several examples of how this works and you can see the basic, high level, overview. It starts
with an innocuous, simple email asking for help, most times related to a gift card or other
quickly monetizable purchase, but that request often doesn't show up until you initially
respond. Once the victim responds, the actor goes into action, requesting very specific
amounts of gift cards typically in the $300 - $500 range. Additionally, they will always request
that the victim open the cards, expose the gift card numbers, take a picture of it, and send it
to them via email. This allows them to start the monetization process and with gift cards,
there's no additional cost to flip these to other individuals. This is not the end of the process
though, at this point the actors pivot and come at you harder. Typical responses to the first
delivery of gift cards is:

Thanks, did you see my other message? I'm going to need more.

At this point, the actor has realized they have an active victim that is willing to give them
money and they begin to push even harder, going back again and again until the unfortunate
victim realizes they are being scammed. However, the damage is already done. Those gift
cards are already sold and used. Despite being fairly simple and low-cost, these campaigns
are surprisingly effective and their popularity is only increasing. However, these are not the
only types of business email compromise examples we see, some examples are a lot more
sophisticated.

Acquisition-themed campaign
One of the more organized and large campaigns centered around acquisitions. This is a
tactic this particular group used before and they are still at it with almost continuous rounds
of emails. This group uses several different tactics to help ensure success with these
campaigns. First and foremost they work to actually spoof their initial email address in the
"FROM" field. In most cases, these emails will have a subject that starts with "Project,"
followed by either an acronym or code word of sorts. Examples include "Violet," "DKM,"
"HLA" and "Cactus". There was a variety in the terms used since this campaign has been
going pretty steadily since late 2019. An example of some of the most recent emails are
shown below.

5/10

These campaigns rely heavily on phone-based social engineering since they are asking the
target to provide a phone number for someone to call. Additionally, the email addresses of
both the sender and receiver appear to be coming from the same company, but if you look
closer, that is not the case. In the image above, the company in question has been redacted,
however, you can still see the reply-to address in the email (smtp-tls-outbound-eugateway@trustnet-gateway[.]cc).
This is the first obvious indicator that this email is not legitimate. If the target were to reply,
the email will be sent to that obviously illegitimate email. This is a typical behaviour for this
group and the domains being used all try and leverage a sense of trust (i.e. trustnetgateway[.]cc, trustnet-server[.]cc) or network activity (gateway-resolver[.]cc,
intranetgateway[.]net).
However, if the user did work in acquisitions for a company and this email hit their inbox, the
likelihood of success seems higher. This is also demonstrated in the targeting of these
campaigns, since they appeared to hit a more curated list of victims. We didn't find a wide
array of companies — small, medium and large — receiving emails. Instead, these tended to
hit larger companies, Cisco included. They also tended to be a bit more descriptive than
what we typically see, but in some cases, it was rather short and direct.
I hope you are doing well.
We are currently working on a sensitive acquisition and I will need your
help to resolve certain matters by the close of the week.
Can you please let me know when you are available and the best number to
reach you at?

Regardless, they all used spoofed from addresses and leveraged the reply-to functionality to
direct traffic to an email address leveraging the four domains they controlled: trustnetgateway[.]cc, trustnet-server[.]cc, gateway-resolver[.]cc, intranetgateway[.]net. Some of the
examples were made to appear to come from mobile sources, others were typical signature
blocks. These campaigns have continued steadily for quite some time with Cisco Talos
finding examples dating back to late 2019 in some cases. Despite their persistence, these
campaigns are typically not high volume, with a small number of emails coming out every
few weeks to a month.

Support contract theme
A second campaign provided a slightly more sophisticated approach to these campaigns and
could result in a higher overall payout. These particular emails were related to something
that anyone who works in an enterprise is familiar with: support contracts. In an enterprise
environment when a large purchase is made for hardware, software, or other technology, a
support contract is likely part of the purchase — this allows the purchaser to do things like
open support tickets or get replacement parts when things break. Business Email
Compromise (BEC) actors have realized that this is a common task organizations have to
deal with, incurring substantial cost, and they've tried to capitalize. We started seeing a
series of emails in mid-2020 with similar subject lines, all ending in "Logistics Support
Request," with some acronym or company name at the beginning. For example, "IDA
Logistics Support Request:"

Subject: IDA Logistics Support Request
Dear
Hope you are in good health?
I need your help with a logistics support payment on behalf of IDA, for
<company>.
Look forward to your reply for more details.
Best wishes, [Sic].

This group also made use of the COVID pandemic, with references laced through some of
the emails. This serves two purposes in this context: It humanizes the criminal and provides
an easy way to strike up a conversation with the victim, hopefully leading to a payout. After
analyzing several of these campaigns, we have a better understanding of how the attack
occurs and the type of payout the attackers seek.
Once a victim responds to the initial email, the criminal begins asking for payment associated
with the support contract. In the examples we analyzed, the primary ask was for several
thousand Euros or GBP specifically, indicating potential targeting of European companies for
this campaign.
Apologies for the inconveniences, I need your assistance with a transfer of
2'867 Euros, for a <company> Support payment. Our treasurer is indisposed
and will not be able to make the transfer at the moment. I am away on a
work-related assignment and I do not have my internet banking access card
reader to make the transfer and it is needed urgently. [Sic].

In most of the examples we analyzed, the victim realized they were being scammed before
they sent any money, but again, this is not always the case. These actors typically just
leveraged free email platforms, mostly Gmail accounts, to conduct these campaigns.

7/10

These actors try a variety of lures and means to achieve their financial goals. As with most
threats, there are different tiers of sophistication, with some extremely basic actors
conducting what amounts to a modified 419 scam to organized groups that are targeting
large organizations with intentions to achieve payouts in the thousands of dollars, at the very
least.

Language diversity
One aspect of Business Email Compromise that isn't commonly addressed is the languages
these attacks leverage. The majority of the emails are in English, but that is largely true for
malicious email. However, it was not the only language we observed being used in
campaigns. During our research, we identified several European languages and some Asian
dialects, as well, although their volume was much lower than the English language examples
of BEC. There were also strange examples where people attempted to use multiple
languages, as in this example that asks for help in both German and French.

Hallo
Ich brauche deine Hilfe, bitte.
S'il vous plaît j'ai besoin de votre aide.

It's important to realize that, especially if you are a multinational company or an organization
that does business in multiple different languages, you need to account for BEC attacks
using any of them. This may require additional filtering and terms that you are flagging based
on that information, but it is likely to catch more attempts than just focusing on English.

Protecting against BEC
One of the biggest challenges of addressing BEC is that these emails rely heavily on
common language and leverage human nature to steal from their victims. As such, detection
can be a challenge. There are solutions in place, but always be aware that it can be difficult
to ensure that only BEC emails are caught up in the net, which is one of the reasons many
organizations rely on tagging of emails vs blocking them outright. The other part of this that
makes it challenging is the lack of URLs or attachments. These are common aspects of most
malicious emails that can be leveraged to help in detection.
The most common solutions involve identifying suspect emails that are originating from
outside the organization. The challenge is determining what level of sensitivity to apply. If you
make detection and blocking too strong, it's likely you will block legitimate emails, which
could affect business. If you make detection too weak, you are adding risk that BEC emails
will reach users' inbox. There are a variety of ways BEC can be addressed in Cisco Secure

Email, up to and including add-ons such as the advanced phishing protection, which adds
sender authentication and some additional BEC detection capabilities. However, there is a
second layer to protecting against BEC: Educating users on how to spot it and what to do.
One simple step that some organizations can take is adding a tag to the subject line of the
email. This can be extremely useful to help users realize the request came from an external
source outside the organization and maybe question the incoming request with a little
additional scrutiny. This doesn't block the email outright, just adds a little context by changing
the subject and adding a tag like "[External]".
There are also a few key questions to ask yourself when seeking out BEC attempts. First,
why is an executive emailing you from a Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook email address? Is this typical
behaviour? Would you typically respond to these requests? And are they using a generic
sounding email (i.e. executivedirector9383489@gmail[.]com or lawfirm283@outlook[.]com)?
Looking for a different reply-to address is another important way to identify them. This is
something you will commonly see in marketing emails but typically shouldn't be found in oneto-one communications. If you hit reply, does the address you are replying to change? Is it to
an unfamiliar domain? These are the first indicators that something isn't quite right. However,
it isn't always easy to make that determination.
Let's assume you're already in the process of being scammed, how would you determine
something is off? Having read through thousands of these email campaigns and a fair
amount of potential victims, we have gleaned a couple of key things to ask during these
exchanges. First and foremost is out-of-band verification. Before you commit to buying
anything, try to communicate to the supposed sender directly through other means, such as
an email to their official address or a DM on a social media platform. This could also be as
simple as a text message or phone call. We've come across countless examples of users
starting down the path to compromise, but by asking key questions, realize they are being
scammed before any serious damage has been done.

Conclusion
There is no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution for BEC. It's going to take a combination
of technology and human capital to defeat this threat. One final note on that — if you do have
a user that stops these types of campaigns, reward them. They have saved your company a
lot of potential loss, and by reinforcing the behavior, hopefully more employees will be willing
to step up and stop these types of attacks from occurring. The problem of Business Email
Compromise isn't going away and as we get better and better at stopping malware from
running and exploitation from being successful, it's only going to get significantly worse.

This post contains basic and sophisticated examples of BEC and shows that they can be
extremely effective. Most estimates have the revenue generated from BEC in the billions,
and although a lot of attention gets paid to more destructive and aggressive threats like big
game hunting, it's BEC that generates astronomical revenue without much of the law
enforcement attention these other groups have to contend with. If anything, the likelihood of
this has only increased in the pandemic, with people relying more and more on digital
communication. The reality is these types of emails and requests happen legitimately all over
the world everyday, which is what makes this such a challenge to stop.
