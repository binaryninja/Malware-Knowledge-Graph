The MuddyWater campaign was first sighted in 2017 when it
targeted the Saudi government using an attack involving
PowerShell scripts deployed via Microsoft Office Word macro. In
March 2018, we provided a detailed analysis of another
campaign that bore the hallmarks of MuddyWater.
In May 2018, we found a new sample (Detected as
W2KM_DLOADR.UHAOEEN) that may be related to this
campaign. Like the previous campaigns, these samples again
involve a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious
macro that is capable of executing PowerShell (PS) scripts leading to a backdoor payload. One
notable difference in the analyzed samples is that they do not directly download the Visual Basic
Script(VBS) and PowerShell component files, and instead encode all the scripts on the document
itself. The scripts will then be decoded and dropped to execute the payload without needing to

As mentioned earlier, our analysis of the sample revealed characteristics that likely connect it to

Attackers are starting to invest in longterm operations that target specific

scout for vulnerable practices,
susceptible systems and operational
loopholes that they can leverage or
abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101:

Technical details
The sample we analyzed was a Word document used as a lure for unsuspecting victims. However,
unlike the samples from the previous campaigns, the lure document deals with a different subject
matter. Instead of using government or telecommunications-related documents, the new lure
document presents itself as a reward or promotion, which could indicate that the targets are no
longer limited to specific industries or organizations.

The document is designed to trick users into enabling the macro to view its full content. However,
the macro’s true purpose is to allow it to execute malicious routines without the user’s knowledge.

Once the macro is enabled, it will use the Document_Open() event to automatically execute the
malicious routine if either a new document using the same template is opened or when the
template itself is opened as a document0.

Figure 3. Executing the malicious routine via Document_Open()
The malicious macro’s code snippet uses three main functions, specifically:
The function contained in the RED box is the Document_Open() event, where all the subfunctions will be executed/called.

The code inside the GREEN box manipulates the images shown in the document’s body.
The code inside the BLUE box constructs the main Powershell commands and scripts. These
will be executed to perform the main routine.

functions
Decoding and deobfuscation
Analysis of the code revealed a PowerShell script capable of decoding the contents of the
malicious document, which results in the execution of yet another encoded PowerShell script.

This will then result in more readable PowerShell scripts capable of dropping various components
in the %Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\* directory. The main PowerShell file invoker.ps1 uses
these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor, previously analyzed by other security
researchers in May 2018.

PRB-Backdoor is a backdoor that takes its name from the function used in the final PowerShell
script payload, as seen in the figure below.

The backdoor communicates with its Command-and-Control (C&C server), hxxp://outl00k[.]net, to
send and receive the following commands:

Countermeasures and Trend Micro Solutions
Given the use of lure documents designed with social engineering in mind, it is likely that the
attackers use phishing or spam to target users who are unaware of these documents’ malicious
nature. Awareness can effectively mitigate or stop these kinds of attacks from being successful.
The first step is to be able to identify phishing attacks and distinguish legitimate emails from
malicious ones. Telltale signs of social engineering include “too-good-to-be-true” offers and
messages that lack context. In general, users should always practice caution when it comes to
email. This includes avoiding clicking on links or downloading any documents unless certain that
these are legitimate.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive response to
today’s stealthy malware, and targeted attacks in real time. It provides a comprehensive defense
