Cypher

Version 1 of the initial access broker (IAB) landscape project helps clarify the economy of
selling accesses by visualizing information flows. The project is curated by Trevor Giffen and
reviewed by the broader Curated Intelligence community.
An "initial access broker" is an individual who compromises systems or user accounts with
the intent of gaining privileged access, to later sell. Initial access sales happen both publicly
and privately, across many contexts. KE-LA does a great job of explaining initial access
brokers here; common examples include:
Advertising access sales on underground forums
Advertising access sales on underground marketplaces
Advertising access sales privately to ransomware actors (ex. 5-30% cut for initial
access alone)
Advertising access sales privately to interested third-parties (ex. information theft)
Gaining access to an internet-facing system, typically servers with an RCE
vulnerability or RDP
Gaining access using an information stealer campaign
Gaining access using information sold on an underground marketplace
Gaining access using reused credentials from third-party data breaches
Gaining access using password guessing, typically bruteforcing or password spraying
Gaining access using a phishing campaign
Gaining access using an insider threat
