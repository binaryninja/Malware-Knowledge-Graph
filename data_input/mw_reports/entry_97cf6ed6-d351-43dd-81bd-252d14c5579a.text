While ransomware is still conducting attacks and all companies must stay alert, ransomware
news has been relatively slow this week. However, there were still some interesting stories
that we outline below.
This week's most interesting story is CNN's report on Conti Leaks, a Ukrainian researcher
who has had access to Conti's internal servers for years.
After Conti sided with Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, the researcher fought back by
leaking internal chats and source code for the Conti Ransomware gang, providing
researchers and law enforcement a glimpse into their operations.

Other interesting news is a clever 'IPFuscation' technique used by the Hive ransomware
gang to obfuscate payloads by representing them as IP addresses to evade detection. By
running the list of IP addresses through a decoder, it results in a binary payload that can be
installed.

Threat Alert: First Python Ransomware Attack Targeting Jupyter Notebooks
Team Nautilus has uncovered a Python-based ransomware attack that, for the first time, was
targeting Jupyter Notebook, a popular tool used by data practitioners. The attackers gained
initial access via misconfigured environments, then ran a ransomware script that encrypts
every file on a given path on the server and deletes itself after execution to conceal the
attack. Since Jupyter notebooks are used to analyze data and build data models, this attack
can lead to significant damage to organizations if these environments arenâ€™t properly backed
up.
