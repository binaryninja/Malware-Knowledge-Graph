Infection vector – phishing websites
• For a successful attack, the attacker requires
strong user interaction

this type of attack
• Phishing websites were blocked once noticed

context
• Malicious documents and C&C were blocked once
noticed

• Minority of the cases used this infection
vectors
• Both vulnerabilities are required for a
successful attack

Infection vector – exploiting vulnerabilities
• For a successful attack, the attacker requires:
• A network access to the management server
• An authentication bypass to such server
• A vulnerability to execute code from this server

• All of these conditions can be mitigated by network
design and patch management
• Malicious payloads and C&C were blocked once
noticed

Custom backdoors – sandbox evasion
• Likely anti-sandbox trick
• request for a non-existent website
• prefix www.github
• https://www[.]github##5o52d[.]com/Daf/post[.]asp

continues as expected

Shared backdoor - ShadowPad
• Backdoor handling multiple plugins
• Used in advanced supply chain attacks
discovered in 2017 and 2018
• Exclusive to Winnti/APT41 until 2019

38

Shared backdoor - ShadowPad
• Usually only 5 plugins are embeded:
• “Plugins”, “Config”, “Install”, “Online”, “HTTP”
• In some cases: “TCP”, “UDP”

• Loaded through DLL side-loading vulnerabilities in
signed executables
• Uses anti-disassembly techniques
• Sometimes packed with VMProtect
39

Shared backdoor - ShadowPad
• New in 2020: sandbox evasion
• if the loading DLL is not the expected one, the
program exits
It evades sandboxes that usually load DLLs with
rundll32.exe

40

Post-exploitation tools – hub relaying

1. connects

Port 3925

3. forwards traffic
C&C server

46

© 2019 Trend Micro Inc.

Port 5688

2. sends traffic

Post-exploitation tools – hub relaying
• Losing control of C&C does not expose the
backend logic
• C&C is simply a connection information
forwarder

47

Infrastructure
48

© 2019 Trend Micro Inc.

Infrastructure
• Multiple “clusters” of domain names
• Infrastructure overlap

• Clusters were usually bound to a specific
malware family

49

© 2019 Trend Micro Inc.

Infrastructure
• From March to August 2020:
• 49 domains resolving to an IP address
• Of which 38 dynamic domain names
• 46 different IP addresses

50

Infrastructure – attacker’s mistakes
• Attacker misconfigured some C&C servers
• We could find some new malware samples
and families, as well as victims

Links to other threat actors
59

© 2019 Trend Micro Inc.

Links to TICK threat actor
• We found Shadowpad samples sharing
encryption algorithms with samples from
TICK (Operation Endtrade)
• This suggests they share a builder
• Shadowpad delivery mechanism is different
for TICK, they use a dropper named CASPER
60

Conclusion
• Earth Akhlut is an advanced threat actor with
big operational and offensive capabilities
• Patches need to be applied to security
solutions
• Public Internet access to management
servers should be avoided unless necessary
