What Wicked Webs We Un-weave: Wizard Spider once again proving it isn’t you, it isn’t me;
we search for things that you can’t see
Authored by: Matt Stafford and Sherman Smith
Executive summary:

1/20

In late January 2022, Prevailion’s Adversarial Counterintelligence Team (PACT) identified extensive phishing
activity designed to harvest credentials for Naver. Naver is a popular South Korean online platform comparable
to Google, that offers a variety of services (e.g., email, news, and search, among many others). For this
reason, a large cache of valid credentials for Naver is potentially very valuable: it can provide access to the
personal Naver accounts of a wide variety of victims while also providing access to several other enterprise
logins as a result of password reuse. Two intriguing facets of this investigation quickly became apparent to
PACT’s analysts: the sheer volume and focus of malicious activity by a single entity, focused exclusively on
harvesting Naver credentials (more than 500 domains), and substantiated overlaps with infrastructure
historically associated with WIZARD SPIDER (a Russia-based, financially-motivated threat actor involved in
initial access and ransomware operations). This overlap is significant because it may indicate a current
geographic targeting preference by one of the most active cyber crime groups in existence and would provide
valuable insight into that group’s operational workflow. However, PACT’s analysis unearthed additional
circumstantial evidence supporting previous assessments that posit an emerging, top-tier “infrastructure as a
service for cybercriminals”. This potential service, if it exists, would explain the WIZARD SPIDER overlap as
well as PACT’s additional findings.
Update: 30 MAR 2022
Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) published a report on 24 Mar 2022 titled, Countering threats from North Korea.
In this report, TAG details the operations of North Korean state-backed threat actors engaged in active exploitation of a
RCE vulnerability in Google Chrome. TAG lists several domains they assess are owned by the threat actors, one of
which is “disneycareers[.]net”. This domain immediately caught PACT’s attention, as it was one of the anomalous
findings we documented in our initial report (below). To quickly summarize: PACT identified this (apparently unrelated)
domain hosted on dedicated infrastructure that was primarily being used to host extensive Naver-themed phishing
activity. Two weeks ago (see update to this blog on 18 Mar 2022), Google TAG published their assessment that an
Initial Access Broker (IAB) with ties to the Conti ransomware gang was using this infrastructure as well. Prior to that,
RiskIQ and Microsoft had identified at least three distinct clusters of activity (WIZARD SPIDER, zero-day exploitation
used to deploy unique Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads, and initial access tooling like BazarLoader and Emotet). PACT
considers it notable and highly unusual that multiple research teams have observed such a wide spectrum of activity
occurring on this infrastructure: phishing, initial access operations, targeted ransomware, and state-backed espionage
have all been well documented.
TAG’s disclosure of additional domains allowed PACT’s analysts to conduct additional pivots. Further overlaps were
indeed observed, but generally amounted to additional “ancillary evidence” (to borrow a phrase from RiskIQ): 5 domains
published by TAG were linked to PACT’s previous findings via pDNS, but all these previous resolutions were part of
shared hosting infrastructure that cannot be definitively tied to a single actor or customer. However, PACT found the
level of overlap noteworthy: over 80 domains listed as part of the Cobalt Strike infrastructure documented by RiskIQ
were linked to the following 5 domains from TAG’s report: chainnews-star[.]com, gbclabs[.]com,blockchainnews[.]vip,
giantblock[.]org, ziprecruiters[.]org. The pDNS overlaps formed by these domains is in addition to the current overlap
seen with disneycareers[.]net, which TAG assesses is part of the recent North Korean-backed Chrome exploitation
activity and hosted on what multiple vendors have assessed to be non-public IP “172.93.201[.]253”. This same IP was
the first critical node identified in PACT’s investigation, as a large number of Naver-themed phishing pages with a
common registrant resolved to this IP.
Additional feedback from the information security community (hat tip to Zetalytics) turned PACT onto what we assess to
be an additional node in this dedicated infrastructure: “23.82.19[.]179”. PACT identified 38 new*/previously-unknown
Naver-themed phishing domains after identifying this IP address. 21 previously-known Naver-themed domains were
seen resolving to both this IP as well as “23.81.246[.]131”, which formed the initial link between the Naver credential
phishing activity and the reported WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure. Further strengthening PACT’s assessment that
“23.82.19[.]179” is a part of this cluster of malicious infrastructure is the fact that registrant persona
“gameproducters@outlook[.]com” registered all newly-identified domains; this same registrant was identified in PACT’s
original reporting. Threat Actor TTP overlaps were also observed and provided added confidence: IP “23.82.19[.]179”
serves HTTP/302 redirects to Naver-themed phishing pages hosted on 000webhostapp.com, which was a technique
PACT observed previously. Furthermore, this IP is part of Leaseweb, Inc.’s US-based dedicated hosting infrastructure,
which PACT identified as the actor’s preferred vendor and geographic location.
*note: PACT included these 38 newly-identified domains in the IOC annex of our report, below.
In summary, the publication of additional information surrounding this infrastructure has led to further uncertainty. The
only assessment of near certainty that can be made in light of recent research is that there is a definite nexus of
malicious use around this infrastructure. Recent reporting has not altered PACT’s initial assessment of moderate
confidence: an as-yet unreported criminal hosting service exists on this infrastructure. The wide variety of malicious
activity and distinct operational goals, initially observed by Microsoft and RiskIQ, deserve special attention and analysis.

Update: 18 MAR 2022
Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) published a blog on 17 Mar 2022 titled, Exposing initial access broker with ties to
Conti. In this report, TAG references the findings of both Microsoft’s MSTIC and RiskIQ’s Team Atlas that PACT also
references below, and builds on the hypotheses and findings of all firms involved in the tracking and analysis of the
criminal enterprise unfolding across the infrastructure that PACT details in our report. TAG identifies and names a
Threat Actor (EXOTIC LILY) operating as an Initial Access Broker (IAB) on this infrastructure. They also corroborate
many previous findings: use of this infrastructure to deploy common tooling centered around a financially-motivated
nexus and an association with WIZARD SPIDER. To quote TAG: “Initial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths
of the security world, and it’s a full-time job.”
PACT used the indicators that TAG published to identify additional overlaps in an effort to provide further value to the
security community. PACT analysts found circumstantial evidence and TTP overlaps that, taken together, serve to
reinforce previous research and strengthen the common intelligence picture. Overlaps such as the threat actor’s
hosting provider preference (Leaseweb USA, Inc): several IPs from this hosting provider’s network appeared as critical
nodes in PACT’s investigation. There was also CDN hosting overlap seen via pDNS sources: TAG identified
“modernmeadow[.]co” as one of the “recent domains used in email campaigns,” and PACT identified that it shared
resolutions with Akamai IPs along with “yeruje[.]com”. RiskIQ had previously identified this domain as a C2 for the
unique Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 Profile that they fingerprinted and tracked as part of the activity cluster exploiting
CVE-2021-40444. Additional TTP overlaps were seen in how the threat actor’s core infrastructure does not appear to be
commercial shared web hosting, as there are no historic resolutions; and in how they use self-signed certificates. The
threat actor’s predilection for avoiding WHOIS Privacy services, leaving unredacted registrant information available for
researchers, was also observed in some of the domains that TAG provided. These observable TTPs were noted by
PACT in our initial publication.
When overlaid with PACT’s pre-existing research, TAG’s findings reinforce our own: the operations of EXOTIC LILY
“appear to be closely linked” with the deployment of Conti ransomware. The operational requirements of an IAB would
certainly explain the activity that PACT observed: the robust domain name buildup targeting Naver. An IAB would need
to send many emails and design spear-phishing messages that seemed convincing and credible to potential victims;
they would also be required to maintain the level of resilience required to sustain operations in the face of domain
attrition caused by phishing protection services. TAG’s assessment that EXOTIC LILY appears to operate as a distinct
entity that utilizes shared infrastructure reinforces PACT’s assessment that “this infrastructure appears to support
separate, discrete campaigns; it also supports operational mechanisms along multiple links of the killchain.” PACT lacks
the visibility to confirm that EXOTIC LILY is the group operating the Naver-themed phishing on this infrastructure, but
the criminal nexus of the infrastructure itself is now well documented. This infrastructure, and its intended use, certainly
match the needs of an initial access broker; when paired with the overlap to known WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure, it
supports the hypothesis that this may be the same threat actor.

Part I: Introduction & Context
In September of 2021, RiskIQ’s Team Atlas and Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) jointly
published technical reports on a cluster of malicious activity that exploited CVE-2021-40444, a vulnerability in
MSHTML that allows remote code execution on a victimized Windows system. The operational roots of this
activity reportedly began in February of 2021. Both RiskIQ and Microsoft observed significant overlap in the
network infrastructure used in this campaign with network infrastructure associated with WIZARD SPIDER.
WIZARD SPIDER (aka UNC1878) is a large, Russia-based, criminal enterprise that has operated the Trickbot,
Bazar, and Anchor families of malicious Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and has been observed deploying the
Conti and Ryuk ransomware families in “Big-Game Hunting” campaigns that target large enterprises.(1,2,3) The
overlaps that Microsoft and RiskIQ observed were related to supporting infrastructure, in the form of non-public
IP addresses, used by WIZARD SPIDER as Command and Control (C2) nodes for Cobalt Strike, which the
group used as a post-intrusion tool prior to the deployment of Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Additional overlap
was seen via domain registrant information (specifically the registrant email address) provided when
purchasing the domains used to create TLS certificates (thus enabling TLS encryption for the Cobalt Strike C2
traffic between victim and attacker).
RiskIQ’s Team Atlas provided an exhaustive list of IP addresses and TLS certificates (and their associated
domain names) that were attributed to WIZARD SPIDER’s C2 infrastructure here.
This list provided PACT with the ability to cross reference and corroborate the Naver-themed phishing activity
that PACT observed with WIZARD SPIDER’s operations.

3/20

It is important to note, however, that both research teams observed anomalies during their investigations that
indicate this overlap may not be indicative of an operation by WIZARD SPIDER, but may instead be indicative
of multiple actors using the same network infrastructure. This overlap could be caused by multiple operators
exploiting known compromised hosts, a “form of command-and-control infrastructure as a service for
cybercriminals”, or some other shared resource not owned by a single threat actor4.
Fast forward 4 months: during the conduct of routine investigation and analysis of malicious web-based
infrastructure, PACT identified a domain of interest (mailmangecorp[.]us) via a tweet by Joe Slowik. With this
initial finding, PACT analysts began methodically illuminating a network of targeted phishing infrastructure
designed to harvest valid login credentials for Naver. The Naver Corporation operates a large, regional, and
popular online platform that provides dozens of customer-facing services (e.g., email, search, social, payment)
and can be compared to a South Korean Google. While investigating the hosting infrastructure being used to
serve the Naver-themed phishing pages, PACT analysts identified overlaps with the WIZARD SPIDER
infrastructure, mentioned above, from RiskIQ’s and Microsoft’s joint reporting. This blog will detail PACT’s
findings and methodology, the noted overlaps with WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure, as well as key takeaways
that may shed new light on the alternate hypotheses put forward by both Microsoft and RiskIQ.
Part II: Findings
IIa: Naver-themed Phishing Activity
By the end of PACT’s investigation, 542 unique domains had been identified as part of this malicious cluster of
web infrastructure, 532 of which were assessed with high confidence to be part of the ongoing phishing
campaign targeting Naver logins; the oldest domain identified by PACT was registered in August of 2021, other
registrations are as recent as February of 2022. The remaining domains were of unknown provenance, part of
previously reported historic malicious infrastructure that PACT tracked as part of this cluster, or were otherwise
anomalous but related via linkages in hosting or registration. The full list of 532 Naver-themed phishing
domains are included in the annex to this report.
The “critical nodes*” of PACT’s investigation turned out to be IP addresses and, when available, domain
registrant personas (identified and tracked by the registration email address used to register the domain). The
first critical node identified was IP 172.93.201[.]253; it quickly became apparent to PACT’s analysis that a large
number of Naver-themed phishing pages with a common registrant (mouraesse@gmail[.]com) resolved to this
IP.

*note: PACT defines “critical nodes” as entities on a graphical link analysis chart that were instrumental in
identifying connections between several, otherwise distinct, clusters of entities and activity.
This IP also provided the first glimpse of a recurring TTP (tactic, technique, or procedure) that PACT identified
as an indicator to strengthen confidence in clustering this activity together: HTTP/302 redirects to spoofed
Naver login pages on Hostinger’s web hosting platform “000webhostapp[.]com”, as seen below –

Image 2: Naver-themed domain hosted on IP 172.93.201[.]253 displaying an HTTP/302 redirect to a spoofed
Naver login page on “000webhostapp[.]com”:
Pivoting on the registrant email “mouraesse@gmail[.]com” allowed PACT to identify that several domains
registered with this email address were seen resolving to another IP address, 23.81.246[.]131. This IP address
became a critical node in PACT’s investigation and formed the initial link between the Naver credential phishing
activity with the alleged WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure. However, before we detail our findings on these
observed overlaps, there are additional critical nodes that are wholly within the distinct cluster of Naver-themed
phishing activity:
Registrant email addresses “peterstewart0326@gmail[.]com” and “kimkl0222@hotmail[.]com”, which
appear to have been used jointly and by the same actor, registered over 100 Naver-themed phishing
domains.
Registrant email addresses “tree99111@hotmail[.]com” and “jhonsteven0001@hotmail[.]com”, which also
appear to have been used jointly and by the same actor, registered 69 domains, some of which had
previously resolved to critical node 23.81.246[.]131.

Part of ASN 395954 (Leaseweb USA, Inc.)

peterstewart0326@gmail[.]com” actor
Displayed TTP overlap (IP seen serving HTTP/302 redirects, notably to the legitimate Naver login
page):
Notably, all the IP addresses listed above as critical nodes, including 23.81.246[.]131, do not appear to be
commercial shared web hosting (as historic resolutions only include the Naver phishing activity). Additionally,
despite all 5 IP addresses having little information available in public scan data, they all appear to be Windows
machines running self-issued TLS certificates.

8/20

It is also important for the reader to note the common usage of the HTTP 302 Redirect in order to funnel
victims to the intended page. PACT observed HTTP 302 Redirects to both additional Naver-themed phishing
domains (seen in Image 4, above) and also to several Naver-themed phishing subdomains on Hostinger’s web
hosting platform “000webhostapp[.]com”. An example appears below on critical node IP address
23.81.246[.]131 (alongside an expired, self-signed TLS certificate):

Image 5: HTTP/302 redirect to 000webhostapp[.]com (a TTP overlap) identified on critical IP 23.81.246[.]131
This screenshot of Shodan’s ‘host’ page for 23.81.246[.]131 (last seen date: 2022-02-15) provides insight into
how the phishing infrastructure can be set up, independent of the final phishing URL hosted on
“000webhostapp[.]com”:
1. Victim clicks or otherwise navigates to one of the 500+ Naver-themed domain names
2. The DNS A-record for an arbitrary number of them is set to an IP address with a web server configured
similar to the way that 23.81.246[.]131 is set up (with a generic, catchall HTTP 302 Redirect) to a
subdomain of “000webhostapp[.]com”
3. Victim’s browser redirects them to the “000webhostapp[.]com” domain, where they are served a
convincing replica of the Naver login page.

9/20

4. Victim enters their credentials, which are captured and now compromised.
This setup is designed to withstand the domain attrition commonly suffered by widely-disseminated phishing
campaigns, which is generally caused by the phishing domains being identified, reported, and taken down or
blocklisted. By disconnecting the final phishing URL from the initial victim-facing URL, the threat actor’s
infrastructure becomes more resilient. Additionally, this increases the odds that the final URLs hosting the
phishkit will be “allowlisted” or not closely inspected (due to the fact that they’re being hosted on a legitimate
hosting platform).
Phishing for Naver credentials appears to be common, which may indicate the relative value of valid logins.
AhnLab’s ASEC reported on Naver phishing activity as well, but the cluster they observed appears distinct as
the threat actor’s TTPs differed: they didn’t use tech-themed domains, they didn’t use HTTP 302 Redirects to
funnel victims to the final credential-gathering page, and the one-time-use number and QR code functionality
weren’t configured. The Naver-themed phishing pages that PACT analyzed had working one-time-use number
and QR code functionality, although we were unable to verify if users were successfully compromised using
these methods.

10/20

Images 6 & 7: the Naver phishing pages PACT analyzed supported one-time-password and QR code
functionality
The subdomains that PACT was able to identify on “000webhostapp[.]com” serving spoofed-Naver phishing
pages are included in the annex at the end of this report. Due to the ease with which the operator can create
new subdomains on this hosting platform, this list is likely outdated and/or incomplete.
IIb: Overlaps with Reported WIZARD SPIDER Infrastructure
In section ‘IIa: Naver-themed Phishing Activity’, PACT stated that overlaps were observed between the network
infrastructure supporting the Naver phishing activity, and that of historic network infrastructure used by
WIZARD SPIDER. This overlap was initially identified via IP 23.81.246[.]131 (seen in Image 5, above,
displaying TTP overlap).
This IP address was initially discovered by PACT’s analysts during attempts to identify which of the 58 phishing
domains registered by “mouraesse@gmail[.]com” were currently resolving, if any. At the time of initial analysis,
the domain “navermailcorp[.]com” was resolving to “23.81.246[.]131”, which PACT further identified resulted in
the HTTP Redirect to a spoofed Naver login page on “*.000webhostapp[.]com”.
Additional investigation yielded two malware samples, as identified on VirusTotal, that were associated with IP
23.81.246[.]131:

Image 8: Malicious files seen communicating with IP of interest 23.81.246[.]131

11/20

Open source reporting identified and corroborated these malicious samples as Cobalt Strike: the extracted
Cobalt Strike Beacon (post-exploitation payload) configuration for one of the samples displays the same
watermark identified by a security researcher on Twitter who identified these samples as part of a cluster of
activity exploiting CVE-2021-40444. Additionally, the network behavior displayed by the other sample shows
HTTP connections to “hubojo[.]com” and “bideluw[.]com”. These two domains are important: they match the
extracted Beacon configuration from the first sample, and they both also represent additional, discrete links to
23.81.246[.]131:
“bideluw[.]com” was observed resolving to this IP via pDNS
RiskIQ reported that this IP previously served the certificate for “hubojo[.]com”, tying it to a Cobalt Strike
C2 server (validating the extracted Beacon configuration from VirusTotal).
These observations all serve to bolster the previous reports of an actor using this infrastructure to support a
campaign exploiting CVE-2021-40444 and to host Cobalt Strike.
With these historic findings in mind, PACT found it notable that more than 40 of the Naver-themed phishing
domains had resolved to IP 23.81.246[.]131. PACT identified numerous emergent resolutions during the
course of the investigation, which suggests that this activity is ongoing and this infrastructure is currently in
use. PACT’s analysis continued throughout the pre-publication pipeline, identifying numerous domains
registered in March 2022. We will update this report as our investigation progresses and yields additional
findings.
In addition to the linkages provided by 23.81.246[.]131, another overlap was observed via IP 23.19.227[.]176.
This IP had previously been associated with “naverservice[.]host” (part of the Naver phishing cluster); however,
it was also detailed in RiskIQ’s report as part of the same Cobalt Strike C2 infrastructure used by the actor
exploiting CVE-2021-40444. In this case, it was tied to “pawbug[.]com”, which PACT independently confirmed
via pDNS.
IP 23.106.215[.]141 forms another link to the infrastructure detailed in RiskIQ’s report, via a link between
“naverncorp[.]com” and “maloxob[.]com”. The domain “maloxob[.]com” was also identified as a Cobalt Strike
C2 server. This IP address also led PACT’s analysts to another domain, cebuwu[.]com, which will be
mentioned later in this report.

12/20

Image 9: Critical overlaps between RiskIQ’s previous findings & the Naver-themed phishing activity.
Further overlaps were identified with two additional IP addresses that are likely to be shared resources**:
1. 184.168.221[.]39: ties together “mailhelp[.]online” (part of the cluster targeting Naver) with
“jumpbill[.]com” and “raills[.]com” (reported as Cobalt Strike C2s by RiskIQ).
2. 195.186.208[.]193: ties together at least two of the domains seen in the Naver phishing activity
(“navrcorp[.]site” & “navercorps[.]online”) and dozens of the Cobalt Strike domains reported by RiskIQ
**Given the number of (apparently unrelated) resolutions recorded on these IPs, it is likely they are, or were,
legitimate shared hosting or another pooled resource being abused by a small number of malicious actors.
Nevertheless, the many links they formed helped increase PACT’s confidence in assessing this activity as
related; therefore, PACT included them in this report.
Part III: Closing Thoughts & Key Takeaways
IIIa. Analytic Gaps & Anomalous Findings
While analyzing and processing the information uncovered in this investigation, PACT identified a number of
outliers and anomalies. They appear below in no particular order:
1. The majority of the domains identified within the Naver-phishing cluster of activity were registered without
privacy protection; i.e., it was trivial for analysts to search for other domains registered with the same
registrant information (e.g., email address). WHOIS Privacy and GDPR have made privacy a de facto
standard during the domain registration process. It is uncommon to find a cluster of activity, especially
one that is attributable to a named threat group like WIZARD SPIDER, wherein all the domain-based
infrastructure is unobscured by privacy protection services.

13/20

2. RiskIQ’s analysis provided insight into the domain-generation algorithm and other TTPs of the Threat
Actor operating the Cobalt Strike infrastructure. This insight led PACT to make note of two domains that
aligned with RiskIQ’s assessment of the actor’s TTPs: cebuwu[.]com and lertwo[.]com. These two
domains overlapped with previous reporting in the following ways:
They are between six to eight alphabetic characters in length, which aligns with the Domain
Generation Algorithm (DGA) likely used by the threat actor(s).
They utilize the “.COM” top level domain (TLD).
The domain cebuwu[.]com used the legitimate Certificate Authority “Sectigo”.
The domain cebuwu[.]com was identified via 23.106.215[.]141, which also links another Cobalt
Strike C2 domain reported by RiskIQ (maloxob[.]com) and the Naver-themed activity (via
naverncorp[.]com).
Likewise, past resolutions link the domain lertwo[.]com to both the Cobalt Strike C2 activity
(195.186.208[.]193, 195.186.210[.]241) as well as the naver activity (navrcorp[.]site,
navercorps[.]online, navertechp[.]online). It is likely that these resolutions are the result of shared
hosting or a pooled resource with many customers but the overlap is notable nonetheless, as it may
indicate an operator preference or behavioral TTP.
3. Investigation of critical node IP 172.93.201[.]253 lead to the discovery of the domain disneycareers[.]net;
which appears to be a convincingly crafted mockup of Disney’s legitimate careers page:
jobs.disneycareers[.]com. The mock site, in addition to being flagged as malicious by Google’s
Safebrowsing service, is notably not served on Akamai’s network, nor is it registered with CSC
CORPORATE DOMAINS, INC. (as Disney’s legitimate site is) but by Namecheap. During the course of
investigation the mock site’s appearance changed notably, possibly indicating active development.
Additionally, the TLS certificate was issued by Sectigo, which matches the behavior noted above
regarding the Certificate Authority of choice for the Cobalt Strike C2 domains. The purpose of this
mockup domain is unknown, but the criminal nexus around the rest of the connected infrastructure
should be enough to warrant additional scrutiny and could perhaps indicate specific targeting.
IIIb. Takeaways
PACT concludes it is highly likely that the Naver-themed phishing activity is operationally linked to the Cobalt
Strike infrastructure identified by RiskIQ (and mentioned by Microsoft). Additionally, PACT wishes to reiterate
that these findings may not necessarily mean that WIZARD SPIDER is conducting the discrete clusters of
activity that have been identified on this infrastructure. The fact that this infrastructure has been used to close
several different links in the killchain across multiple campaigns (and perhaps by separate actors), coupled
with the observations detailed by RiskIQ and Microsoft, may lend additional credence to the hypotheses they
put forth. It is worth quoting both firms at some length.
Risk IQ states:
“Despite the historical connections [between WIZARD SPIDER and the Cobalt Strike C2 infrastructure],
we cannot say with confidence that the threat actor behind the zero-day campaign is part of WIZARD
SPIDER or its affiliates, or is even a criminal actor at all, though it is possible.”
“The overlap with known ransomware infrastructure in this case could mean one of several things. First,
that the zero-day operators compromised the infrastructure of the ransomware operators. Second, that
the criminal operators are allowing the zero-day operators to piggyback on their existing infrastructure.
Third, that the zero-day and ransomware operators are one and the same but engaging in espionage
instead of financial crime. Finally, it could mean that both entities could be utilizing the same third party
providing Bulletproof Hosting services. There is strong ancillary evidence that suggests this is the case.”
(emphasis PACT’s)
Furthermore, Microsoft states:

14/20

“The infrastructure we associate with DEV-0365 has several overlaps in behavior and unique identifying
characteristics of Cobalt Strike infrastructure that suggest it was created or managed by a distinct set of
operators. However, the follow-on activity from this infrastructure indicates multiple threat actors or
clusters associated with human-operated ransomware attacks (including the deployment of Conti
ransomware). One explanation is that DEV-0365 is involved in a form of command- and-control
infrastructure as a service for cybercriminals.”
PACT’s findings reinforce these assessments: this infrastructure appears to support separate, discrete
campaigns; it also supports operational mechanisms along multiple links of the killchain: it has hosted phishing
domains, initial exploitation tools, and C2 servers.
PACT found the latter especially notable, as the Naver-themed phishing activity that was initially discovered
does not appear to be the work of a ransomware group directly. In many cases, pre-ransomware activity (such
as mass phishing and credential gathering activity) is handled by affiliates or brokers who provide access to
the ransomware operators, while post-compromise activities, ransomware development, and
deployment/encryption are executed by yet other groups. This separation of duties is not uncommon within the
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) criminal business model. Similar to what Microsoft and RiskIQ reported,
PACT’s findings regarding the additional “uncertainty surrounding the nature of the shared qualities” of this
infrastructure and the “significant variation in malicious activity” strengthen the hypotheses that both firms put
forward: multiple entities could be utilizing the same third party providing “bulletproof hosting” services to
conduct their operations. PACT was unable to refute this hypothesis, and so assesses with moderate
confidence that an as-yet unreported criminal hosting service exists on this infrastructure. The only links that
PACT was able to identify were hosting and DNS resolutions; no other operational mechanisms provided links
to the reported WIZARD SPIDER activity (such as registrants, malicious samples, etc). Therefore, a novel and
emerging “infrastructure as a service for cybercriminals” fits the available evidence.
A third hypothesis, which PACT finds unlikely, is that multiple operators are leveraging a third party’s
compromised infrastructure to support their own discrete and unrelated campaigns. The relatively limited,
publicly available information on the IP addresses that make up the core of the operational infrastructure
seems to indicate an operator that adheres to strict operational security measures. Legitimate entities rarely
have so little publicly available or accessible information on their available services on a given IP address.
This fact, along with the historic overlaps in hosting combined with other observations, led PACT to find this
final hypothesis improbable.
