Targeted a voice actor YouTuber in South Korea
On February 6, 2023, a voice actor YouTuber in Korea received an e-mail impersonating a Bandai
Namco game company. The e-mail embedded a Dropbox link downloading malware, then the YouTuber
downloaded the malware and executed it. Later, his YouTube channel was compromised and changed to
a Tesla US channel.
Fortunately, the YouTuber was able to regain access to his compromised account and posted a video
explaining how the attack had taken place. Thanks to the information provided by him, we were able to
obtain the original spear-phishing email and malware from VirusTotal. We would like to express our
gratitude to him for their bravery in sharing the details of the attack and helping to uncover the truth.
Based on our analysis, we have identified the following attack flow:
1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email targeting the YouTuber.
2. Downloads a ZIP file containing malware via the Dropbox link in the spear-phishing email.
3. Executes the malware, which is disguised as a PDF document inside the ZIP file.
4. The malware downloads additional malware from the command and control (C&C) server.
5. The malware loads the additional malware, Pure Crypter.
6. The Pure Crypter injects the Lumma Stealer into the process.
7. The Lumma Stealer steals information from the victim’s system and sends it to the C&C server.
Figure 4. Lumma Stealer infection and execution flow
It has been confirmed that the victim’s YouTube account, which was infected with Lumma Stealer, was
hacked and the channel name was changed to “Tesla US”.
Figure 5. Victim’s YouTube channel changed to the Tesla advertising account
The channel name and thumbnail changed, but the previously uploaded channel notices not
changed.

Distributed via Spear-phishing
The e-mail used the “bandai.namco.ma[@]kakao.com” account to impersonate Bandai Namco game
company. The email requested the victim’s cooperation in promoting a new game and urged them to
download and execute the file via the Dropbox link included in the email.
Title : Re: Bandai Namco YT Offer 2023
Sender : bandai.namco.ma[@]kakao.com
Although Bandai Namco is a Japanese company, the email was sent through the account from
kakao.com, one of the most used mail domains in Korea. As the targeted YouTuber is also Korean, we
assess with low-confidence that there is a possibility that the attacker is also Korean.

The file downloaded through the Dropbox link contained a normal video file and a malicious file
disguising a PDF document. Once executed, additional malware is downloaded from the C&C server,
and Lumma Stealer is finally installed.

Pure Crypter
Upon analyzing the downloaded from the C&C server, it was identified as a Pure Crypter. Pure Crpyter is
a tool written in C# and developed by an individual known as “PureCoder,” which is available for sale on
underground forums in the form of software as a service (SaaS). This tool includes features designed to
bypass security products, including obfuscation and process injection, and is commonly used to drop
additional malware.
Table 3. Features provided by Pure Crypter
Figure 8. Pure Crypter sales site
The Pure Crypter reads the separate data included within and then decrypts it to obtain configuration
values for performing malicious actions set as desired.
Table 4. Fields in configuration
{"1":0,"2":"Itself","3":"","4":false,"5":"Vszbhncwjwcaklzwbvyio","6":
{"1":false,"2":false,"3":null,"4":null,"5":false},"7":

After extracting the configuration values, an additional malware payload is read from the resource and
decrypted. In this case, the Lumma Stealer malware is loaded and injected into a separate process for
execution. If the file name specified in the injection-related configuration does not exist, Pure Crypter
performs injection using the Process Hollowing technique in the current process.
