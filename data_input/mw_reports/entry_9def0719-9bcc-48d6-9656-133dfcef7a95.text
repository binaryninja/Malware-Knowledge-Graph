An Infostealer is a trojan that is designed to gather and exfiltrate private and sensitive
information from a target system. There is a large variety of info stealers active in the wild,
some are independent and some act as a modular part of a larger task such as a Banking
Trojan (Trickbot) or a RAT.
Infostealers are usually lightweight and stealthy payloads that do not have persistence or
propagation (get-in and get-out) capabilities. This type of trojan is particularly difficult to
detect as it leaves an extremely small footprint.
During what began as a routine incident response process, Morphisec has identified (and
prevented) a new .NET infostealer variant called Jupyter. Morphisec discovered this variant
as part of assisting a higher education customer in the U.S. with their incident response.
Jupyter is an infostealer that primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data.
However, its attack chain, delivery, and loader demonstrate additional capabilities for full
backdoor functionality. These include:
a C2 client
download and execute malware
execution of PowerShell scripts and commands
hollowing shellcode into legitimate windows configuration applications.
Jupyterâ€™s attack chain typically starts with a downloaded zip file that contains an installer, an
executable that usually impersonates legitimate software such as Docx2Rtf. Some of these
installers have maintained 0 detections in VirusTotal over the last 6 months, making it
exceptional at bypassing most endpoint security scanning controls.
Upon execution of the installer, a .NET C2 client (Jupyter Loader) is injected into a memory.
This client has a well defined communication protocol, versioning matrix, and has recently
included persistence modules.
The client then downloads the next stage, a PowerShell command that executes the inmemory Jupyter .NET module. Both of the .Net components have similar code structures,
obfuscation, and unique UID implementation. These commonalities indicate the development
of an end to end framework for implementing the Info stealer.
Morphisec has monitored a steady stream of forensic data to trace multiple versions of
Jupyter starting in May 2020. While many of the C2s are no longer active, they consistently
mapped to Russia when we were able to identify them.
This is not the only piece of evidence that this attack is likely Russian in origin. First, there is
the noticeable Russian to English misspelling of the planet name. Additionally, Morphisec
researchers ran a reverse Google Image search of the C2 admin panel image and were not
surprised to find the exact image on Russian-language forums.
