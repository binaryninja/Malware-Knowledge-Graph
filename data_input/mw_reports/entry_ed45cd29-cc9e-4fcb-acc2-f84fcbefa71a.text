CrowdStrike has observed a significant increase in eCrime actors targeting VMware
ESXi hypervisors with ransomware since our February 2021 blog post on Hypervisor
Jackpotting.
Many of these adversaries share common tradecraft such as gaining interactive access
via SSH, listing and terminating running VM processes prior to encryption, and
targeting the vmfs/volumes datastore path to encrypt disk volumes and snapshots.
Several defensive controls, listed later in this blog, should be implemented to mitigate
the success or impact of hypervisor jackpotting.
In February 2021, CrowdStrike blogged about Hypervisor Jackpotting, a technique that
involves targeting VMware ESXi hypervisors with ransomware to increase the scope of
impact. CrowdStrike noted that two big game hunting (BGH) adversaries, CARBON SPIDER
and SPRITE SPIDER, were observed utilizing this technique with their respective
ransomware variants, Darkside and Defray777. Since then, CrowdStrike has observed a
significant uptrend in hypervisor jackpotting by other adversaries, including PINCHY SPIDER

and VIKING SPIDER. In this blog, we overview each new campaign CrowdStrike has
observed targeting ESXi systems and detail defensive controls that can be implemented to
protect these critical assets.

Babuk Locker
In March 2021, operators of Babuk Locker ransomware offered access to an ESXi variant as
part of a sought-out partnership opportunity. In May 2021, CrowdStrike Services observed a
victim targeted with this ESXi variant. The ransomware appends the file extension
.babyk_esxi to files it encrypts, and creates a ransom note named How To Restore
Your Files.txt . The ransom note contains two URLs: a victim-specific .onion URL for
communications, and one for the Babuk Locker dedicated leak site (DLS).

FERAL SPIDER and DeathKitty
Since March 2021, FERAL SPIDER, the developers and operators of DeathKitty (aka
HelloKitty) ransomware added functionality to terminate and encrypt virtual machines running
on a VMware ESXi hypervisor. If VMware ESXi targeting is enabled ( -e option), the
ransomware will only encrypt file extensions related to disk volumes and snapshots: . vmdk ,
.vmsd and .vmsn . When executed with the -k argument, the ransomware will terminate
all running virtual machines using VMware ESXi’s command-line administration utility
( esxcli ) prior to beginning the encryption process.

CYBORG SPIDER and Pysa
Since May 2021, CYBORG SPIDER, the developers and operators of Pysa ransomware,
have targeted ESXi servers for encryption. After compromising an environment, CYBORG
SPIDER operators move laterally to the hypervisors via HTTPS using the native ESXi root
account, where they enable SSH for a remote shell. The operators then use PuTTY and
WinSCP to copy the ransomware to the /tmp directory and execute the commands shown
in Table 1.
Command

Description

python --version

Check version of Python installed

cd /tmp/

Change to /tmp/ directory

chmod +x <FILENAME>

Add execute permission to Pysa script

./<FILENAME> /vmfs/volumes 4096

Execute Pysa against the VM datastore path

Table 1. Pysa commands

2/5

CrowdStrike observed multiple cases in which the Pysa ransomware script was tailored for
the version of Python installed on the ESXi, with Pysa filenames 27 and 3 noted as highly
likely to correspond with Python v2.7 or v3.x. The ransomware also appends the file
extension .pysa to files it encrypts, and creates a ransom note named
RECOVER_YOUR_DATA.txt at the root ( / ) of the volume. The ransom note provides two
email addresses, hosted on OnionMail and ProtonMail, for communications and includes
Pysa’s DLS .onion domain.

PINCHY SPIDER and REvix
Since June 2021, PINCHY SPIDER has distributed a Linux ransomware variant named
REvix to target ESXi systems. The ELF binary uses the same encryption algorithm as
PINCHY SPIDER’s Windows REvil ransomware. The ransomware contains a JSON
configuration block that specifies the ransom note filename and encrypted file extension to
use. For example, in a sample of REvix v1.1c, the ransomware was configured to append
the file extension .rhkrc to encrypted files, and use the name rhkrc-readme.txt as the
ransom note. By default, the ransomware will encrypt only the current directory and requires
the --path option to specify the target folder (e.g., /vmfs/ ), which is then recursively
enumerated. Prior to encryption, the ransomware executes the commands shown in Table 2.
Command

Description

pkill -9 vmx-*

Terminate any processes
named vmx-*

esxcli --formatter=csv --formatparam=fields=="WorldID,DisplayName" vm process
list | awk -F "\"*,\"*" {system("esxcli vm
process kill --type=force --world-id=" $1)}

List the running VMs on this
system and force terminate
each VM based on the
enumerated list of World IDs

Table 2. REvix commands
In July 2021, PINCHY SPIDER began distributing REvix v1.2a, which added execution of VM
termination functionality within a separate thread, and support for additional encryption types.
In mid-July 2021, PINCHY SPIDER’s DLS infrastructure went offline, leaving in question the
future of these operations.

VIKING SPIDER and Ragnar Locker
Since June 2021, VIKING SPIDER has deployed Ragnar Locker’s ELF binary to ESXi
systems via SSH using the native root account. VIKING SPIDER copies the binary to the
/tmp directory and issues the commands shown in Table 3.
Command

Description

3/5

uname -a

Print all system information

esxcli system version get

Display the product name, version and build
information

esxcli system hostname get

Display the fully qualified hostname of the ESXi host

esxcli system account list

List local user accounts

esxcli --formatter=csv vm
process list

List the running VMs on this system

esxcli vm process kill -w
<WID> -t soft

Perform a “soft” kill (clean shutdown) of the VM
associated with the given World ID
This command is repeated for each running VM to kill

e sxcli --formatter=csv vm
process list

List the running VMs on this system (again) to confirm
they are all shutdown

find /vmfs/volumes/ -type f
-name "*.vmdk"

Search for all virtual disk files within the VM datastore
path

chmod a+x /tmp/<FILENAME>

Add execute permission to Ragnar Locker binary

/tmp/<FILENAME>
/vmfs/volumes/<UUID>/

Execute Ragnar Locker against the VM datastore
path

ps | grep <FILENAME>

Ensure Ragnar Locker process is running

Table 3. Ragnar Locker commands
The ransomware appends the file extension .crypted to files it encrypts, and creates a
ransom note per encrypted file using the original filename appended with the extension
.crypted.README_TO_RESTORE . The ransom note includes a unique victim URL for live
chat communications via Tor, as well as VIKING SPIDER’s dedicated leak site (DLS) .onion
domain.

How to Protect Your Cluster
Listed below are CrowdStrike’s top five recommendations that organizations should
implement to mitigate the success or impact of hypervisor jackpotting.
Avoid direct access to ESXi hosts. Use the vSphere Client to administer ESXi hosts
that are managed by a vCenter Server. Do not access managed hosts directly with the
VMware Host Client, and do not change managed hosts from the Direct Console User
Interface (DCUI). (Note: This is a VMware-specific recommendation.)

4/5

If direct access to an ESXi host is necessary, use a hardened jump server with
multifactor authentication. ESXi DCUI access should be limited to a jump server
used for only administrative or privileged purposes with full auditing capabilities and
multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.
Ensure vCenter is not exposed to the internet over SSH or HTTP. CrowdStrike has
observed adversaries gaining initial access to vCenter using valid accounts or
exploiting remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-21985).
Although these vulnerabilities have been addressed by VMware, these services should
not be exposed to the internet to mitigate risk.
Ensure ESXi datastore volumes are regularly backed up. Specifically, virtual
machine disk images and snapshots should be backed up daily (more frequently if
possible) to an offsite storage provider.
If encryption activity is observed, do not shut down the ESXi hosts. If encryption
activity is observed, system administrators may be tempted to reboot or shutdown
VMs. Be aware that ransomware is not able to modify locked files, and if a VM is still
powered on, it will be considered locked. As a result, shutting down or rebooting VMs
will actually release the lock and allow the ransomware to encrypt the virtual disk files.
Additional ESXi security recommendations are available from VMware at
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUIDB39474AF-6778-499A-B8AB-E973BE6D4899.html.

Conclusion
CrowdStrike has observed a significant uptrend in eCrime campaigns targeting VMware
ESXi hypervisors with ransomware to maximize encryption impact across a victim
environment. This targeting modus operandi is becoming prevalent, with adversaries
developing and deploying ESXi ransomware variants, and in some cases seeking
partnership opportunities with other operators or access brokers.
CrowdStrike recommends that organizations review their ESXi security posture and
implement the specific defensive controls outlined in this blog to protect these critical assets.
