Turla Group Exploits Iranian APT To Expand Coverage Of Victims

Introduction
The Turla group, also known as Waterbug or VENOMOUS BEAR, is widely reported to be associated with Russian
actors. Turla uses a range of tools and techniques to target government, military, technology, energy and commercial
organizations for the purposes of intelligence collection.
Previous advisories from NCSC detailed Turla’s use of Neuron and Nautilus implants and an ASPX-based backdoor
alongside the Snake rootkit. This document provides an update on the reported activity, with a particular focus on how
those tools were used in the period leading up to, and following, the publication of those advisories.
Since those advisories were published, NCSC, NSA and partner-shared analysis of additional victims and infrastructure
determined the Neuron and Nautilus tools were very likely Iranian in origin. Those behind Neuron or Nautilus were almost
certainly not aware of, or complicit with, Turla’s use of their implants.
After acquiring the tools – and the data needed to use them operationally – Turla first tested them against victims they had
already compromised using their Snake toolkit, and then deployed the Iranian tools directly to additional victims. Turla
sought to further their access into victims of interest by scanning for the presence of Iranian backdoors and attempting to
use them to gain a foothold. The focus of this activity from Turla was largely in the Middle East, where the targeting
interests of both Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) overlap.
The timeline of incidents, and the behavior of Turla in actively scanning for Iranian backdoors, indicates that while Neuron
and Nautilus tools were Iranian in origin, Turla were using these tools and accesses independently to further their own
intelligence requirements. The behavior of Turla in scanning for backdoor shells indicates that although they had a
significant amount of insight into the Iranian tools, they did not have full knowledge of where they were deployed.
While attribution of attacks and proving authorship of tools can be very difficult – particularly in the space of incident
response on a victim network – the weight of evidence demonstrates that Turla had access to Iranian tools and the ability
to identify and exploit them to further Turla’s own aims.

Background: Neuron and Nautilus Usage by Turla
The NCSC published two advisories on the use of Neuron and Nautilus tools by Turla in late 2017 and early 2018. These
tools were observed in use alongside Snake on a number of victims.
Since publication of those advisories, further analysis by NCSC, the NSA and the wider Cybersecurity community
determined Neuron and Nautilus tools were present on a range of victims, with a large cluster in the Middle East. Victims
in this region included military establishments, government departments, scientific organizations and universities. Some of
these victims, but not all, also had a Snake implant present.

Victim Overlap
Investigation into these victims identified that while some implants had been deployed and administered from
infrastructure associated with the Turla group, others had previously been connected to by Virtual Private Server (VPS) IP
addresses associated in the Cybersecurity community with Iranian APT groups.
Interestingly, in some instances, it appeared an Iranian APT-associated IP address first deployed the implant, and later,
Turla-associated infrastructure accessed the same implant.

In order to initiate connections with the implants, Turla must have had access to relevant cryptographic keys, and likely
had access to controller software to produce legitimate tasking.
In other instances, Turla deployed Neuron to victims in which they already had access to via their Snake toolkit, all with
observed connections from Turla-associated infrastructure.

Scanning for Backdoors
Turla also made use of existing Snake victim networks to scan for the ASPX shell described in the initial advisory attempting to identify the presence of, and access, the ASPX webshell on IP addresses in at least 35 countries, including
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and UAE.
Commands were passed to the ASPX shell in encrypted HTTP Cookie values, requiring knowledge of the cryptographic
keys to produce valid tasking and successfully interact with it.
From one Snake victim, a log file was recovered which recorded the output of Turla’s scanning for these ASPX shells with
the strings “!!!MAY BE SHELL!!! (check version)” and “!!!MAY BE SHELL!!! (100%)”; over 3500 unique IP addresses were
scanned.
Once identified, Turla appeared to use these ASPX shells to gain an initial foothold into victims of interest, and then
deploy further tools.

Turla Compromise of Iranian C2 Infrastructure
Turla accessed and used the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure of Iranian APTs to deploy their own tools to
victims of interest. Turla directly accessed ‘Poison Frog’ C2 panels from their own infrastructure and used this access to
task victims to download additional tools.
Reporting from Symantec®12 details a specific victim in the Middle East where Turla was observed delivering their own
malware via a Poison Frog panel, which Symantec and others in the Cybersecurity community attribute to APT34 (also
known as OilRig/Crambus).

Turla Compromise of Iranian Operational Infrastructure
The Turla group deployed their own implants against the operational infrastructure used by an Iranian APT actor and used
this to further their own accesses into the Iranian APT’s global infrastructure.
Exfiltration of data from Iranian APT infrastructure to Turla infrastructure took place.
Data exfiltrated from the Iranian infrastructure by Turla included directory listings and files, along with keylogger output
containing operational activity from the Iranian actors, including connections to Iranian C2 domains. This access gave
Turla unprecedented insight into the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the Iranian APT, including lists of active
victims and credentials for accessing their infrastructure, along with the code needed to build versions of tools such as

Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
As this advisory provides additional context around historical activity from the Turla group, these IOCs are provided for
completeness. They may be useful to any investigator with historic data from a previous Turla (or Iranian APT)
investigation.
