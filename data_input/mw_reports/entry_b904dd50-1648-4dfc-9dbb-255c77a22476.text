Organizations in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been hit in latest
attacks that involve new wiper malware.
After a two-year absence, the destructive malware Shamoon (W32.Disttrack.B) re-emerged
on December 10 in a new wave of attacks against targets in the Middle East. These latest
Shamoon attacks are doubly destructive, since they involve a new wiper (Trojan.Filerase)
that deletes files from infected computers before the Shamoon malware wipes the master
boot record.
News of the attacks first emerged on December 10 when Italian oil services firm Saipem said
that it had been hit by a cyber attack against its servers in the Middle East. Two days later,
the company said that Shamoon had been used in the attack, which affected between 300
and 400 servers and up to 100 personal computers.
Symantec has found evidence of attacks against two other organizations during the same
week, in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both organizations are involved in the
oil and gas industry.

New wiper deployed
Unlike previous Shamoon attacks, these latest attacks involve a new, second piece of wiping
malware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware will delete and overwrite files on the infected
computer. Shamoon itself will meanwhile erase the master boot record of the computer,
rendering it unusable.
The addition of the Filerase wiper makes these attacks more destructive than use of the
Shamoon malware alone. While a computer infected by Shamoon could be unusable, files
on the hard disk may be forensically recoverable. However, if the files are first wiped by the
Filerase malware, recovery becomes impossible.
Filerase is spread across the victimâ€™s network from one initial computer using a list of remote
computers. This list is in the form of a text file and is unique to each victim, meaning the
attackers likely gathered this information during an earlier reconnaissance phase of the
intrusion. This list is first copied by a component called OCLC.exe and passed on to another
tool called Spreader.exe. The Spreader component will then copy Filerase to all the
computers listed. It will then simultaneously trigger the Filerase malware on all infected
machines.

It is possible that the Shamoon malware itself was spread via these same tools, but this is
unknown. In at least one instance, Shamoon was executed using PsExec, indicating that the
attackers had access to credentials for the network.

Possible link to Elfin
One of the new Shamoon victims Symantec observed the organization in Saudi Arabia had
recently also been attacked by another group Symantec calls Elfin (aka APT33) and had
been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan.Stonedrill). There were additional attacks
against this organization in 2018 that may have been related to Elfin or could have been the
work of yet another group.
The proximity of the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization means it is
possible that the two incidents are linked.

A history of destructive attacks
Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first emerged in 2012 when it was used in a series of disruptive
attacks against the Saudi energy sector.
Activity then ceased until it made a surprise comeback in late 2016. A slightly modified
version of the malware (W32.Disttrack.B) was used in attacks against a range of targets,
again in Saudi Arabia. The attacks appeared timed to cause maximum destruction. The
malware was configured to trigger at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17, 2016.
The Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped
after most staff had left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the
attack was complete.

Recurring menace
Why Shamoon has suddenly been deployed again remains unknown. However, the fact that
the malware seems to be taken out of retirement every few years means that organizations
need to remain vigilant and ensure that all data is properly backed up and a robust security
strategy is in place.
