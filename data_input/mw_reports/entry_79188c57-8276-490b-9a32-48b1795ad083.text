Chaos Ransomware Variant Sides with Russia

May 17, 2022

Since the beginning of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, some ransomware and hacking
groups have publicly declared which side they are on. Such actions have created tension
internally within the threat actor groups as it has caused dissension, and externally, as
organizations fear being targeted due to the political nature of the war.
One notable example is the Conti RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) that officially announced
in February 2022 that they are backing Russia and would use their arsenal against critical
infrastructures that belong to the West. Fear spread quickly as many organizations around
the globe had been victimized by the Conti group in the past, with stolen data exposed and
critical files being encrypted. However, the Conti group was bitten back soon after the
announcement was made. An allegedly unhappy Conti insider took the matter in their hands
and leaked Conti’s internal chat logs to the public.
On the other side of the debate, the LockBit ransomware group made it clear that they will
not involve themselves in the political war because of the multinational nature of its
developers and affiliates.
In this vein, FortiGuard Labs recently came across a variant of the Chaos ransomware that
appears to side with Russia. This blog explains the vicious consequences that the Chaos
variant delivers to a compromised machine.
Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Parties: Windows users
Impact: Potential loss of files
Severity Level: Medium

Technical Details
A GUI-based Chaos ransomware builder is known to be available that can easily customize
the malware according to a set of options. FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a sample of
malware that seems to have been created using this builder. Unfortunately, how the malware
arrives on a victim’s machine is unknown. However, given the political stance of the malware
(the blog will cover this later), the malware likely arrives either via forum posts or emails
focused on the current Russia-Ukraine war.
Once the malware runs, it enumerates the files on all drives. For files smaller than 2,117,152
bytes, it generates a random 20-character long password for each file and then encrypts it
with AES-256 (CBC-SALTED). Each encrypted file contains an RSA encrypted password with
1/8

a hardcoded public key + base64 encoded AES encrypted file content. The malware also adds
a ‘fuckazov’ file extension to the affected files. Figure 1 shows the content of an encrypted file.
“azov” may be a reference to the Azov Battalion who put up a fierce fight against Russian
military forces in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine.

Figure 1. Content of an encrypted file
For files larger than 2,117,152 bytes, the malware fills them with random bytes, making file
recovery impossible without backup. The affected files also have 'fuckazov’ as a file extension.
For the C: drive, the malware searches for files in the following directories and either
encrypts or fills them with random data depending on the file size and adds a ‘fuckazov’ file
extension.
"\\Desktop"; "\\Links"; "\\Contacts"; "\\Desktop"; "\\Documents"; "\\Downloads";
"\\Pictures"; "\\Music"; "\\OneDrive"; "\\Saved Games"; "\\Favorites"; "\\Searches";
\\Videos.
Its malware activities are typical of recent Chaos ransomware variants. Like most
ransomware, it displays a message in “stop_propaganda.txt”. However, things get a bit
interesting from here as it displays the following message:

2/8

Stop Ukraine War! F**k Zelensky! Dont go die for f**king clown!
You can see the truth here:

[removed].ru

Figure 2. Message displayed by the malware
As seen in Figure 2, there is no ransom demand nor any information on how the victim can
reach out to the attacker. The links on the message leads to a Russian Web page, created in
April 2022, with what appears to be political messages and information:

Figure 3. Screenshot of the Web page linked in the message displayed by the malware
The message reads in English:
“- Victory will be ours!
Information and Coordination Center”

Figure 4. Description of the Web site
Machine translation into English is as follows:
Who we are
Our priorities are:
In connection with the full-scale information and economic war unfolding against the
Russian Federation, the Information Coordination Center ikts was created - a group of likeminded people whose main goal is to combat the spread of false information about the
activities of the Russian Federation and the Russian Armed Forces.
1. Blocking channels on Telegram, VK 2. Blocking propaganda sites,
2. Blocking propaganda sites that disseminate false information
3. Investigating violations of rights and civil rights and freedoms
Current Targeting Guidelines
In order to participate and contribute to the information confrontation, please see the
Toolkit section, where you can learn how to work most effectively in each area.

If you know of a fake news channel or website which is spreading false information,
defaming Russia, or violating human rights and it is not on our list, please contact us.
At the moment the following resources are being coordinated:
The Web site also appears to include a list of Ukrainian soldiers who were either killed in
combat or who are considered war criminals in the eyes of the Russian Armed Forces.
While typical Chaos ransomware variants provide at least some hope to the victim that files
smaller than 2,117,152 bytes that were encrypted might be recovered upon ransom payment,
this particular variant provides no such avenue as the attacker has no intent on providing a
decryption tool. Combining that with the deletion of shadow copies from the compromised
machine, which inhibits file recovery, makes it awfully difficult for non-tech savvy victims to
recover their affected files.
The malware appears to be fresh as it was likely compiled on May 16th, 2022, for this attack.

Conclusion
The Chaos ransomware variant that this blog covers is unique in the sense that the attacker
has no intention of providing a decryption tool or file recovery instructions for its victims to
recover their affected files. Finding them is a tall order for non-technical victims, which
pretty much makes the malware a file destroyer. Clearly, the motive behind this malware is
“destruction.” The politically inclined messages also indicate that the attacker is pro-Russian
and frustrated with the current situation. And with the Chaos ransomware builder now
readily available, its options allow anyone to create destructive malware. And with no end to
the war in sight, FortiGuard Labs expects more malware like this to emerge.
Victims of ransomware are cautioned against paying ransoms by such organizations as CISA,
NCSC, the FBI, and HHS. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may also
embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to
engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities which could
potentially be illegal according to a U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) advisory.

Fortinet Protections
FortiGuard Labs has AV coverage in place for the malicious file sample in this report as:
MSIL/Filecoder.AGP!tr.ransom
6/8

Fortinet customers are also protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering,
FortiMail, FortiClient, FortiEDR, and CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) services.
Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to the reputation
of an organization, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable
information (PII), etc., it is important to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.
In addition to these protections, Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users
to understand and detect phishing threats:
The FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help
organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce
proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.
We also suggest that organizations have their end users go through our FREE NSE
training: NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness. It includes a module on Internet threats
that is designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various
types of phishing attacks.
