Russian Police Prevented Massive Banking Sector Cyber Attack
From The Media
The Russian Interior Ministry’s department of cyber crimes exposed a group
that had planned several major cyber attacks on international payment
systems and Russian banking systems. According to the department, the
group was comprised of over 50 highly capable members with initial plans to
steal up to 1.5 billion RUB.

iSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment
Due to vague media reporting on this subject, it remains unclear whether the activity reported
is related to Corkow or GCMAN. Reports appeared to imply that the group disrupted by the
Russian Interior Ministry pertained to Corkow, but, given the apparent strong relation
between this report and activity recently reported by Kaspersky, we suggest the activity is
more consistent with what Kaspersky described as GCMAN activity, which was neutralized
before financial institutions experienced significant losses.

Malware Targets All Android Phones—Except Those in Russia
1/5

From the Media
According to CSIS Security Group, a malware strain is targeting all Android
devices except for those in Russia. The malware, dubbed MazarBOT,
possesses the ability to take full control of a target device and, according to
CSIS, appears to be focusing targeting on online banking customers.
MazarBOT performs a location test upon installation and will stop if it detects that the device
is within Russia.

iSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment
It is typical of Russian-origin malware to disable itself if it detects it is being run on a Russian
device, usually because laws in Russia prohibit cyber crime activities targeting the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Also of note, there is a malware family tracked
as “Mazar,” “GMBot,” “Slempo”, or “Slembunk” that we judge to be distinct from MazarBOT.
While the malware types share a few common functionalities (mainly related to SMS use),
the majority of functions and a large portion of the code are different. For example,
MazarBOT uses Tor for hiding communication; GMBot does not.

Critical GLIBC Vulnerability Puts Nearly All Linux Machines at Risk
From The Media
The Linux GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a critical flaw affecting
almost all Linux machines. Glibc was last affected by the Ghost vulnerability
in January 2015. The current flaw (CVE-2015-7547) is a stack-based buffer
overflow in the glibc DNS client-side resolver. The vulnerability could result in
remote code execution.

iSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment
Although a large number of Linux systems are reportedly vulnerable, we consider CVE-20157547 to be a medium-risk vulnerability due to the potential for arbitrary code execution, offset
by the address space layout randomization (ASLR) bypass requirement. Further, exploitation
is easily mitigated by limiting DNS response sizes and verifying DNS queries. Proof-of-

concept (PoC) code is publicly available, but is only capable of causing a denial-of-service
(DoS) condition; full exploit code is privately held by Google. We are unaware of exploitation
in the wild.

nuclear power plant operator demonstrate links to the high-profile breach of
Sony in late 2014. These findings indicate that the actors responsible for the
Sony hack most likely also have connections to multiple malware families and campaigns
including DarkSeoul, TEMP.Hermit and WildPositron—groups and tools believed to be linked
to North Korean actors. The newly released information suggests the actors behind the Sony
breach (dubbed “The Interviewers”) remain at large and are involved in ongoing cyber
espionage operations.

iSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment
Although specific technical indicators have not yet been released (and the researchers have
indicated they do not intend to reveal all of their findings publicly), the findings are consistent
with previous iSIGHT Partners reporting. Published analysis of Volgmer malware and
TEMP.Hermit operations indicates potential connections with other probable North Korean
activity. Shared code and a distinct password shared across multiple droppers support the
notion that the actors behind the Sony hack are linked to continuing North Korea-nexus
campaigns.

China and Russia Step Up Cyber Attacks on Australia

3/5

From The Media
Actors are increasingly targeting the Australian Government’s secure
communications network. Chinese and Russian actors’ increased attacks
have forced Australian Government agencies to use the Intra Government
Communications Network (ICON). Hundreds of attempts are made each
month to access the government’s ICON system, with China-sourced attacks
being the most predominant.

iSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment
We cannot verify a spike in intrusion activity against the Australian Government’s secure
network. However, the government’s initiative to improve cyber defenses suggests that
associated bureaus have been compromised or experienced a high volume of intrusion
activity. iSIGHT Partners has previously reported on Chinese-nexus activity targeting
Australian interests, including 338 Team, UPS Team, Mana Team, and JJDoor malware
activity. Further, Russian operators known as Koala Team also targeted Australia as part of a
widespread, global campaign to collect proprietary data.

Russian Cyberspy Group Uses Simple yet Effective Linux Trojan
From the Media
Pawn Storm, a Russian cyber espionage group, is infecting Linux systems
with the Fysbis Trojan. The Fysbis Trojan does not require root privilege
access, and is also modular, allowing actors to integrate plug-ins for
expanded functionality. Fysbis’ primary purpose is to steal data, such as
documents and web browsing activity.

iSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment
This article refers to malware iSIGHT Partners previously reported as “XAgent,” a tool
developed and commonly employed by Russian-nexus actors tracked as Tsar Team (aka
APT28). The XAgent framework exploits several platforms, including Windows, Linux, and
Apple IOS, and is typically delivered through a Sofacy dropper, commonly linked to Tsar
Team operations. XAgent has various modules that enable espionage operations, including
one that allows propagation in air-gapped networks.
