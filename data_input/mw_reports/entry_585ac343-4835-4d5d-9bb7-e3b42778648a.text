FIN12: The Prolific Ransomware Intrusion Threat Actor
That Has Aggressively Pursued Healthcare Targets
mandiant.com/resources/fin12-ransomware-intrusion-actor-pursuing-healthcare-targets

Today, Mandiant Intelligence is releasing a comprehensive report detailing FIN12, an
aggressive, financially motivated threat actor behind prolific ransomware attacks since at
least October 2018. FIN12 is unique among many tracked ransomware-focused actors today
because they do not typically engage in multi-faceted extortion and have disproportionately
impacted the healthcare sector. They are also the first FIN actor that we are promoting who
specializes in a specific phase of the attack lifecycle—ransomware deployment—while
relying on other threat actors for gaining initial access to victims. This specialization reflects
the current ransomware ecosystem, which is comprised of various loosely affiliated actors
partnering together, but not exclusively with one another.
The full published report covers historical and ongoing activity attributed to FIN12, their use
of partners to enable their operations, including initial access providers, the evolution of the
group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures, and trends in their extensive use of Cobalt
1/9

Strike BEACON.
The Mandiant Security Validation (Validation) Behavior Research Team (BRT) has created
VHR20210922 – FIN12, which is accessible on the Content page of the Validation Customer
Portal.

FIN12 Victims
FIN12’s operations provide illustration that no target is off limits when it comes to
ransomware attacks, including those that provide critical care functions. Almost 20 percent of
directly observed FIN12 victims were in the healthcare industry and many of these
organizations operate medical facilities. We observed FIN12 activity at healthcare
organizations both before and after the joint alert by multiple U.S. government entities in
October 2020 that warned of an “increased and imminent” threat to hospitals and medical
facilities. This targeting pattern deviates from some other ransomware threat actors who had
at least stated an intention to show restraint in targeting hospitals, especially throughout the

2/9

COVID-19 pandemic. FIN12’s remaining victims have operated in a broad range of sectors,
including but not limited to business services, education, finance, government,
manufacturing, retail, and technology.
While these victim organizations have been overwhelmingly located in North America, there
is some evidence that FIN12's regional targeting is expanding. Nearly 85 percent of the
group’s known victims have been based in North America, however, we observed twice as
many victim organizations based outside of North America in the first half of 2021 than we
observed in 2019 and 2020 combined. Collectively, these organizations have been based in
Australia, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Ireland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the
United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. This shift could be due to various factors
such as FIN12 working with more diverse partners to obtain initial access and increasingly
elevated and unwanted attention from the U.S. government.
We believe that the most significant factor in FIN12’s targeting calculus has been a victim’s
annual revenue. The vast majority of known FIN12 victims have more than $300 million USD
in revenue, based on corporate financial data compiled from ZoomInfo. While this data is
skewed to our direct visibility, FIN12 does appear to consistently target larger companies in
comparison to the average ransomware affiliate. Targeting victims that meet a certain
revenue threshold also aligns with underground forum activity; some threat actors, including
those using RYUK, have specified different ranges of minimum requirements for potential
victims’ annual revenue. Further, comments detailing revenue information in malware
administration panels operated by FIN12’s initial access providers illustrate that this is a
relevant factor for victim selection or at minimum for prioritization of available targets.
FIN12’s selection of high-value targets is consistent with the broader trend of threat actors
pursuing larger targets in recent years, almost certainly because of the perception that it
justifies proportionally large ransom demands.

Parasites And Symbiotes
From the beginning of their operations and until March 2020, we observed FIN12 exclusively
leverage TRICKBOT accesses as a launching point for their ransomware attacks. However,
after returning from a nearly four-month hiatus in August 2020, the initial access vectors
leveraged by FIN12 became increasingly diversified. In at least some cases, these variations
may reflect the use of distinct initial access providers. For example, beginning in early 2021,
we directly observed several cases where the first evidence of FIN12 activity was a login to a
victim’s Citrix environment. This activity is also consistent with our identification of multiple
Russian-speaking actors operating in underground communities seeking partners who could
provide Citrix accesses for RYUK ransomware operations. Although we currently lack
sufficient evidence to attribute these actors to FIN12, these solicitations nonetheless further
support the likelihood that FIN12 has not relied on a single initial access provider to enable
their operations. This division of labor is not uncommon and reflects the professionalism and
specialization of the cybercrime ecosystem overall.

3/9

In many incidents, where the initial intrusion vector was identified, FIN12 activity was
observed on the same day as the initial access campaign suggesting that FIN12 maintains a
close relationship with at least some threat actors providing them access. Most notably,
FIN12 maintains a close relationship with TRICKBOT and BAZARLOADER affiliated actors.
Beyond leveraging accesses obtained via these families, FIN12 has used overlapping
toolsets and services including backdoors, droppers, and codesigning certificates. Despite
these similarities, we track FIN12 as a distinct threat actor given their specific role in the
deployment of ransomware, their ability to work independently of these families, and our
observations of other distinct threat actors who also deploy ransomware using accesses
obtained via these malware ecosystems.

Prioritizing Speed
FIN12's reliance on other threat actors to obtain initial access to organizations and their
specific focus on ransomware deployment has paid dividends in terms of their time-toransom (TTR). We calculate the TTR as the amount of time from when they first access an
environment to when they begin to deploy ransomware. In the first half of 2021, as compared
to 2020, FIN12 significantly improved their TTR, cutting it in half to just 2.5 days. These
4/9

efficiency gains are enabled by their specialization in a single phase of the attack lifecycle,
which allows threat actors to develop expertise more quickly. FIN12 also stands out in the
pack of ransomware operators today because they do not usually engage in multifaceted
extortion—a tactic that has become commonplace in today’s threat landscape. The most
significant factor in FIN12's decision to refrain from stealing victim data and publicly shaming
victims may be the impact it has on the speed of their operations. The average TTR across
our FIN12 engagements involving data theft was just under 12.5 days compared to 2.5 days
where data theft was not observed. Each additional day FIN12 spends in an environment
before completing their objective increases their risk being detected. FIN12's apparent
success without the need to incorporate additional extortion methods likely suggests the
notion that they to not believe spending additional time to steal data is worth the risk of
having their plans to deploy ransomware thwarted.

Implications
While threat actors running ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) outfits have an important role
in multifaceted extortion attacks, the focus on the branding and communication components
of these services can detract from other important players. Intrusion actors, such as FIN12,
may arguably play a more pivotal role in these operations, yet have received marginal
attention. These actors are the ones navigating victim networks and deploying the
ransomware itself, and in at least some cases, may have direct input into the target
selection. The skillset required for this role may be comparatively less developed within the
cyber-criminal underground, which has historically put a heavy emphasis on malware
development, distribution, and the management of cash-out operations. We also constantly
observe solicitations from threat actors looking to recruit individuals to join intrusion teams,
sometimes even trying to hire individuals under false pretenses, facts that may be reflective
of a talent shortage in this area. Notably, intrusion groups do not typically have an allegiance
5/9

to any particular RaaS brand and have exhibited that they can easily switch between or use
multiple brands concurrently. The shifting nature of these allegiances is a key reason for why
intrusion operators such as FIN12 are important for security teams and organizations to
understand and track rather than maintaining an exclusive focus on the brands and
ransomware families these operators choose to distribute at a given moment.
