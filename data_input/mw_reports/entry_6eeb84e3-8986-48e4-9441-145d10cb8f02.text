Introduction
On Tuesday 2020-01-21, a wave of malicious spam (malspam) hit various recipients in
Germany. Messages from this German malspam were email chains associated with infected
Windows hosts, and these emails all had password-protected zip archives as attachments.
A closer look revealed this malspam was pushing Ursnif.
Today's diary reviews this malspam and an Ursnif infection from one of the attachments on
Tuesday 2020-01-21.

Shown above: Flow chart for an infection from this wave of German malspam.

The malspam
See the next three images for examples from this wave of malspam. Of note, this campaign
often used 777 as the password for the attached zip archive. In this wave of malspam, we
saw passwords 111, 333, and 555. Other passwords were probably used as well in
examples we have not yet reviewed.

The attachments
Using the password from the email, you can extract a Microsoft Word document from the
password-protected zip archive. The message in the Word document is in German, and it
directs you to enable macros. All of the Word documents are named info_01_21.doc. Of
note, in recent versions of Microsoft Office, you must disable Protected Mode and bypass
some other security features to enable macros and infect a vulnerable Windows host.

archives.

The infection traffic
Infection traffic is typical for Ursnif infections in recent months. Other examples of Ursnif
traffic can be found here, which contains infections from 2019. Of note, the follow-up
malware for this Ursnif infection was another Ursnif variant.

Forensics on an infected Windows host
The infected windows host contained artifacts commonly seen with these type of Ursnif
infections. See the images below for details.

Shown above: Artifacts in seen the C:\Windows\Temp directory after enabling macros.

infected host.
