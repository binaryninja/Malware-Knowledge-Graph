By the end of 2013, the Chinese cybercrime
underground was a very busy economy, with peddled
wares that not only targeted PCs, but mobile devices as
well—making it its most prolific segment. We also saw
cybercriminals abusing popular Web services such as
the instant­messaging app (IM), QQ, to communicate
with peers.
Today, the Chinese underground is thriving more than
ever. Previous explorations in the Chinese underground
have indicated that cybercriminals are quick to adapt to
technological advancements and existing trends as
seen throughout 2015. Data (either leaked or stolen)
are now being traded along with prototypes and new
functional hardware, like point­of­sales (PoS) and
automated teller machine (ATM) skimmers. As the
Chinese underground continues to burgeon, we expect
to see more cybercriminal activity using these new
market offerings:

property theft, espionage, and extortion. Chinese cybercriminals have managed to enhance the way they share data as

Cash transactions are slowly becoming a thing of the past, as evidenced by the adoption of electronic and mobile payment
means.
PoS skimmers ­ Tampered PoS devices are sold to resellers who may or may not know that these devices are
rigged. Some PoS skimmers come with an SMS­notification feature that allows the cybercriminal to access the
stolen data remotely every time the device is used.

ATM skimmers –Commonly sold on B2B websites, these fraud­enabling devices allowed fraudsters to carry out
bank fraud and actual theft. The devices have keypad overlays that are used to steal victims’ PINs.
Pocket skimmers – These small, unnoticeable magnetic card readers can store track data of up to 2,048 payment
cards. They do not need to be physically connected to a computer or a power supply to work. All captured data
can be downloaded onto a connected computer.
Our paper, Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015 provides a closer look into the country's
underground market and how it has kept up with events in the real world.
