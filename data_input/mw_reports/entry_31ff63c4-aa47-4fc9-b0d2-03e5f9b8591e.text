Market offerings: As
robust as they are unique

Two years after publishing our last report on the wares and services
traded in the bustling Chinese underground1, we found that the market’s
operations further expanded. Traditional malware designed to run
on all platforms as well as mentorship and hacking services are still
heavily present. But with time come new innovations—ones that are
now gaining popularity among China’s tech-savviest crooks. New
hardware and channels have gone beyond being mere proofs of concept
(PoCs) to become the working models driving the cybercrime trends in
China today.
We saw increased Chinese underground activity over a 10-month period.
Chinese-speaking cybercriminals, regardless of nationality, continued
to abuse popular Web services like the instant-messaging (IM) app, QQ,
to communicate with peers. Through these channels, they offer botnet
services used to instigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks along
with products like exploit kits.
Our past explorations of the Chinese underground, including their thriving
mobile underground2, showed how quickly cybercriminals adapted to
technological advancements and existing trends. 2015 was no different,
as evidenced by the presence of several recently developed leaked-data
search engines.
We have also seen the production and sale of new hardware like point-ofsale (PoS) and automated teller machine (ATM) skimmers. These come with
training services that teach cybercriminals how to use the said hardware.
Skimmers like these offer cybercriminals a lucrative business model that
can negatively affect small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).
The presence of these offerings show just how well the Chinese underground
has not only kept up with events in the real world, but how it is also leading
the way in terms of cybercriminal innovation. Other markets—especially
those in regions with frequent data-breach- or PoS-related cases—may
soon follow.

SECTION 1

Leaked-data search engines:
Intel gathering made easy
for criminals

Leaked-data search engines:
Intel gathering made easy
for criminals
The Deep Web is simply the vast and hidden section of the Internet that is not accessible via search
engines3. A huge chunk of the Deep Web deals with cybercriminal activities and illegal services, a part of
which has to do with leaked personal data, including addresses and other sensitive information.
The recent spate of data breaches has resulted in a surplus of data dumps for sale on underground
websites4. These dumps contain personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card credentials (now
sold in bulk, irrespective of brand). PayPal, poker, and even Uber accounts can now also be found via
leaked-data search engines, a first in the Chinese and other underground markets.
The data leaked underground allows attackers to commit crimes like financial fraud, identity and intellectual
property theft, espionage, and even extortion. Armed with sensitive or potentially damaging information
on a politician, for instance, like leaked personal details on an extramarital affair website, a cybercriminal
can discredit the target who may be lobbying for the approval of, say, the national cybercrime bill.

Free search engines and forums
CnSeu (cnseu.pw/) is a forum for trading leaked data. Users buy and sell leaked data using forum coins
or credit points that can be purchased on Alipay with corresponding amounts in RMB (RMB 1 = 10 forum
coins = ~US$0.16*).

* Currency exchange rate as of 26 October 2015 was used for all conversions in this paper (US$1 = RMB 6.34)

5 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Figure 1: CnSeu provides users a means to communicate with peers
about various topics related to cybercrime resources, tutorials, and tools
While forums have been keeping cybercriminals connected with one another, they managed to come up
with even more ways to offer stolen data. SheYun, a search engine specifically created to make leaked
data available to users, is one such way.

Figure 2: SheYun’s search database contains leaked data ranging from bank account credentials
to poker account information; users simply have to provide usernames (输入用户名), QQ details,
and email addresses to avail of its services

6 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

SheYun also has a government database that its users can get information from, and ironically, a privacyprotection feature for those who wish to prevent certain data from appearing as search results.

Figure 3: SheYun users who wish to prevent certain information from appearing as search results
can avail of its privacy-protection feature, which costs RMB 100 (~US$16) per keyword;
a message saying details are protected by the engine’s protection service (抱歉，此账号已加入SheYun
隐私保护服务，详情请看) appears each time keywords pointing to them are used

Premium products and services
In 2013, the most popular Chinese underground offerings were compromised hosts, DDoS attack tools
and services, and remote access Trojans (RATs)5.
This year, we discovered new product and service offerings in the Chinese underground. These include
social engineering toolkits, comprehensive tool sets required to carry out successful social engineering
attacks.
Social Engineering Master (社工大师) is one such tool. It allows cybercriminals to search through leaked
data, send spoofed emails, and create fake IDs using templates, among others, for a meager sum of
~RMB 317 (US$50). Users who access Social Engineering Master are automatically redirected to an
online payment page if they want to avail of its products and services.

7 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Figure 4: Social Engineering Master’s comprehensive list of features include the ability to obtain
data (MD5 hashes, PII, and mobile numbers) from dumps, QQ groups, and hotel registers, along with
templates for phishing emails and fake IDs as well as fake WeChat, Alipay, and QQ Wallet balances; it
also comes with exploit kits, phishing websites, and Trojan downloaders, among other cybercrime tools

Figure 5: Social Engineering Master’s main interface contains links to pages where its various features
(password [查密码], hotel check-in data [开房记录], QQ group data [查Q关系], all other data [查老密], old
password [查老密], and people queries [搜索找人]; social engineering tools [社工搜索]; email-spoofing
templates [邮件发送]; fake government [身份证正反] and online ID creation tools [身份伪造]; a social
engineering dictionary [社工字典]; fake Alipay [支付宝], WeChat [微信], and QQ Wallet [QQ钱包] balancemodification tools; as well as ready-made exploit kits [网马], QQ Trojans [QQ木马], phishing kits
[钓鱼程序], and downloaders [下载者]) can be accessed

8 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Apart from SheYun, paid engines that allow users to search for cybercriminal offerings also abound.
PassBase is one example of such.

Figure 6: Using PassBase costs RMB 68 (~US$11) per year; its home page warns users
about using dangerous query search terms (请不要使用危险字符查询)

Figure 7: TuoMiMa’s service also costs RMB 68 (~US$11)
to access its database of dumps, much like SheYun’s

Carding: Ever-thriving
criminal enterprise backed
by innovation

Carding: Ever-thriving
criminal enterprise backed by
innovation
The noncash transaction volume in China has drastically grown over the past two years, made apparent
by the adoption of electronic and mobile payment means. Alongside countries in the “emerging Asia”
group6, China is expected to register a 27% noncash payment growth rate, driven by increased Internet
use and mobile payment transactions.
Cybercriminals quickly jumped on the noncash payment bandwagon. They now offer carding devices like
PoS and ATM skimmers to interested buyers at fairly reasonable prices.
Despite the development of mobile payment systems as PoS terminal alternatives, most SMBs still favor
the use of PoS systems for receiving payment. SMBs have thus become easy carding scheme targets.
Carding has to do with unsavory forums and websites involved in the increasingly regimented process of
stealing and laundering credit card information7.
Various publicly accessible websites sell PoS, ATM, and credit card pocket skimmers. Skimmers refer to
devices that extract data from payment card magnetic strips8. In a previously published in-depth study
of PoS malware9, we said skimmers cannot be readily mass deployed for maximum effectiveness; the
Chinese underground has now proven otherwise.
Credit card fraud made headlines in February last year, when an individual from Hangzhou was tried
in the United States (US) for a successful spam run10 that cost card providers roughly RMB 5,130,000
(~US$808,855).

11 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

PoS skimmers
We found PoS skimmers on the business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce site, 1688.com. These devices
were bought by retailers who then resell them to small businesses that are always on the lookout for the
most reasonable prices. These resellers may or may not know that the gadgets they are peddling have
been tampered with.

Credit card information goes to the cybercriminal.

Figure 8: Typical modus operandi that PoS skimmer sellers use

Figure 9: PoS skimmers are sold for RMB 5,000 (~US$788) each on lzise.com;
the site is run by a cybercriminal who specializes in selling customized PoS terminals
that look no different from those that have not been tampered with, but come with a
special chip that allows criminals to authorize otherwise unauthorized purchases

12 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Some of the PoS skimmers sold underground even have an SMS-notification feature. This allows
cybercriminals to instantly get their hands on stolen data via SMS every time the tampered devices are
used. Cybercriminals do not even have to physically collect stolen information from installed devices,
allowing them greater flexibility and convenience. They can also more easily expand their operational
scope by merely installing their skimmers into more PoS devices across stores, countries, and even
regions.
Such was the case that made the news just this August11. A company reportedly sold the modified devices
to a number of small restaurants and hotels. Investigators found 1,100 sets of stolen card information
stored in the company’s servers. Despite the small number of stolen credit card records, the scammers
were still able to cost victims a fairly significant amount—RMB 1.5 million (~US$236,507).

Figure 10: PoS skimmer with an SMS-notification feature sold for RMB 8,000 (~US$1,261)
on 1688.com; the device has been modified to allow cybercriminals to instantly receive
credit card numbers (including card verification values [CVVs]) via SMS when used

13 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Figure 11: Even chip-and-personal identification number (PIN) card users are unsafe, as some PoS
skimmers come with PIN pad skimmers that also have SMS-notification features

Figure 12: PoS skimmers with SMS-notification features instantly send stolen data
in the format shown above (PIN and credit card number) to cybercriminals

ATM skimmers
In March 2014, we saw a cybercriminal produce and sell ATM skimmers and fake PoS terminals in several
underground forums12. These fraud-enabling devices reportedly originated from China. The sale of such
devices continued and thrived. What is more worrisome though is that our fear then—that mass production
of fraud-enabling devices could very well ensue—has seemingly come true.

Figure 13: ATM skimmers cost RMB 4,000 (~US$631) each; these came installed with a microchip
that records payment card track data or the confidential information stored on a card’s
magnetic strip, along with a microcamera that allows cybercriminals to obtain a victim’s PIN
ATM PIN skimmers are also commonly sold on B2B websites, offering cybercriminals more ways to
successfully carry out bank fraud and actual theft. For a sum of RMB 2,000 (~US$315), fraudsters can
use these as keypad overlays in order to more effectively steal victims’ PINs. These come with a small
memory chip that saves all captured PINs that cybercriminals can physically retrieve in order to gather the
information they need to complete their fraudulent acts.

15 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Figure 14: ATM PIN skimmer sold on the e-commerce website, lzise.com, for RMB 2,000 (~US$315)

Pocket skimmers
Mass-produced pocket skimmers come in handy for crooks who do not wish to physically tamper with
ATMs and PoS terminals in order to steal. These are small and so easily go unnoticed. An unscrupulous
store staff member can, for instance, swipe an unwitting customer’s card on a pocket skimmer in order to
steal track data that he/she can later use for fraud.

Figure 15: Pocket skimmers are sold for RMB 900 (~US$142) on 1688.com’s digital appliances section

16 | Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015

Pocket skimmers are small magnetic card readers that can store track data from up to 2,048 payment
cards. They do not need to physically be connected to a computer in order to work. They do not even
require an external power supply and can read the data stored on the magnetic strip of any kind of credit
card. All stored information can then be downloaded onto a connected computer.

PoS skimmers
Can come equipped with an SMS-notification feature
that instantly sends stolen data to cybercriminals

ATM skimmers
Have two components that allow cybercriminals to
steal victims’ card data and PINs

Pocket skimmers
Portable card readers that capture all of the data
stored in the magnetic strip of payment cards

Figure 16: Skimmers produced and sold in the Chinese underground

Skimmer tutorials and materials
Hardware specially made to instigate crime are not the only offerings in the Chinese underground. Training
services and materials that would-be cybercriminals can make use of also abound.
We found underground dealings in phpBB, an open source forum where users traded information
on carding device training and materials. Aided by our Deep Web Analyzer13, we were able to locate
Tor文交流论坛, a website on The Onion Router (TOR) where the phpBB forum was hosted. Access to TOR
is blocked in China so the network is hardly used. But since carding has become such a hot commodity
in the country, related products and services have cropped up in TOR sites.

Figure 17: Forum post where carding courses are offered in exchange for bitcoins
(2BTC [~US$569.58] ** per “bible,” a guide to carding, that will made available in
two weeks’ time; buyers are guaranteed to get returns on their investment after
a week or two); discounts are offered to previous customers; ads for domestic
and international credit card track data are also seen

Figure 18: Forum post that offers the “Alpha02 CARDING Christmas Version (学院圣诞版)” bible, which
teaches users to use carding hardware and software for 0.3BTC (~US$85.44; 50% off discounted rate)
Similar offerings that can be used to abuse Internet of Things (IoT) devices can also be seen in the
Chinese underground. Readily available devices and knowledge shared in anonymous forums will usher
in a new wave of more skilled and confident cybercriminals in China.

Market offerings:
As robust as they are unique

Market offerings:
As robust as they are unique
Since 2012, we have been providing updated lists of the products and services peddled in the Chinese
underground. These offerings are available to any enterprising criminal from anywhere in the world.
Most of the wares we spotted were designed to target Chinese citizens. Americans, Europeans, and the
Japanese may experience monetary losses as well since credit card dumps from their countries are also
sold in the Chinese underground. Local cybercriminals can either use the credit card data for their own
personal gain or sell them to other buyers.
We also noted that bulletproof hosting still plays a significant role in Chinese cybercriminal marketplace.
Several local phishing sites as well as sites that sell counterfeit wares all rely on these hosting services
to stay up. It’s also possible that leaked-data search engines use such services to store the data dumps.
Take a look at the Chinese underground’s latest offerings with updated prices from 2013 to 2014 or 2015.
