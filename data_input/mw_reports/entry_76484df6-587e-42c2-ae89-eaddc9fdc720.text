What the Group Claims to Be
• Sources include an interview with a BlackMatter
representative, the BlackMatter Ransomware public extortion
blog, hacking forum advertisements, affiliate panel information,
and ransom notes.
• The BlackMatter representative claims they do not to attack a
variety of industries, including hospitals, and if these entities
are attacked, then the company can ask for free decryption.
• “We will not allow our project to be used to encrypt critical
infrastructure that will attract unwanted attention to us.”
• Claims the ransomware development took six months and
includes best features of LockBit, REvil, and Darkside.
• The security system is thoroughly developed, and the project
uses a decentralized structure protected from various
vulnerabilities.
• New stable Windows and Linux ransomware tested in various
environments, including Windows Server 2021, Windows 11,
ESXI 7.0, Ubuntu 18, Debian 10, CentOS 8.
• Note: These details are what BlackMatter claims to be, and
may not be accurate.

Role of Initial Access Brokers (IABs)
• Initial Access Brokers (IABs) are individuals who
sell access to compromised networks for further
exploitation by ransomware operators.
• In general, Initial Access Brokers (IABs) play a
major role in ransomware operations.
• Most commonly, hackers sell RDP credentials,
VPN login details, and web shells.
• These details often include the victim’s name, type
of access, level, location, or industry. In some
cases, the sellers detail the type and number of
machines found on the compromised network, as
well as the types of data that could be found there.
• HC3 has observed at least 65 instances of threat
actors selling network access to healthcare entities
on hacking forums in the past year.
• Ke-La analyzed 1,000 forum posts selling network
access over the past year (since August), and
found that the top affected country was the United
States, with 4% in the healthcare industry.
• May serve as early warning to a more impactful
ransomware incident, but is still an indicator of
possible network compromise.

What We Know About BlackMatter Ransomware
• Written in C that encrypts files using a combination of
Salsa20 and 1024-bit RSA
• Targets Windows and Linux systems
• Attempts to mount and encrypt unmounted partitions
• Targets files stored locally and on network shares, as
well as removable media
• Can terminate processes prior to encryption
• Deletes volume shadow copies and ignores specific
directories, files, or file extensions during encryption
• Can be configured to upload system information to a
remote server via HTTP or HTTPS
• Collected system information may include system
name, username, domain, language information, and
list of enumerated drives

General Recommendations

General efforts to help prevent
ransomware attacks include:
1.

Maintain offline, encrypted backups of
data and regularly test your backups.

2.

Create, maintain, and exercise a basic
cyber incident response plan,
resiliency plan, and associated
communications plan.

3.

Mitigate internet-facing vulnerabilities
and misconfigurations.

4.

Reduce the risk of phishing emails
from reaching end users.

5.

Practice good cyber hygiene.

Mitigations for BlackMatter Ransomware
The HHS 405(d) Program published the Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices (HICP), which is a free
resource that identifies the top five cyber threats, and the ten best practices to mitigate them. Below are the
practices from HICP that can be used to mitigate BlackMatter:

Outlook
• Ransomware trends:
o IABs have been driven underground by law enforcement action.
o Affiliates are leveraging multiple ransomware families to achieve goals.
o Ransomware developers are rebranding to avoid law enforcement action.
• Threat to the HPH:
o While there have not been any public healthcare victims yet, BlackMatter’s suspected predecessors
targeted the healthcare sector.
o HPH organizations should remain on alert despite the group’s claims to not target healthcare.
