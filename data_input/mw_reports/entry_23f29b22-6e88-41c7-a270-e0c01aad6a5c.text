Threat Activity Group

ALLANITE
Since 2017
ALLANITE accesses business and industrial control (ICS) networks, conducts
reconnaissance, and gathers intelligence in United States and United Kingdom electric
utility sectors. Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that ALLANITE operators
continue to maintain ICS network access to: (1) understand the operational environment
necessary to develop disruptive capabilities, (2) have ready access from which to disrupt
electric utilities.

ALLANITE operations continue and intelligence indicates activity since at least May 2017.
ALLANITE activity closely resembles Palmetto Fusion described by the US Department of
Homeland Security (DHS). In October 2017, a DHS advisory documented ALLANITE
technical operations combined with activity with a group Symantec calls Dragonfly (which
Dragos associates with DYMALLOY).
ALLANITE’s targeting and techniques are similar to other activity groups, including
Dragonfly, and activity Dragos labels DYMALLOY. However, ALLANITE’s technical
capabilities are significantly different from Dragonfly and DYMALLOY.
ALLANITE uses email phishing campaigns and compromised websites called watering
holes to steal credentials and gain access to target networks, including collecting and
distributing screenshots of industrial control systems. ALLANITE operations limit
themselves to information gathering and have not demonstrated any disruptive or damaging
capabilities.
ALLANITE conducts malware-less operations primarily leveraging legitimate and available
tools in the Windows operating system.

Public disclosure by third-parties, including the DHS, associate ALLANITE operations with
Russian strategic interests. However, Dragos does not corroborate the attribution of others.
US officials told the media in July 2017 these adversaries gained access to business and
administrative systems, not operations networks. Since then, third-party reporting indicates
ALLANITE has gathered information directly from ICS networks, which Dragos can
independently confirm.
Dragos threat intelligence leverages the Dragos Platform, our threat operations center, and
other sources to provide comprehensive insight into threats affecting industrial control
security and safety worldwide. Dragos does not corroborate nor conduct political attribution
to threat activity. Dragos instead focuses on threat behaviors and appropriate detection and
response. Read more about Dragos’ approach to categorizing threat activity and attribution.
Dragos does not publicly describe ICS activity group technical details except in
extraordinary circumstances in order to limit tradecraft proliferation. However, full details on
ALLANITE and other group tools, techniques, procedures, and infrastructure is available to
network defenders via Dragos WorldView.
