Executive Summary
BlackGuard Stealer, which collects and exfiltrates credentials and device information from
infected PC, first appeared when the official seller posted a promotion article on the dark
web forum in January 2022
BlackGuard Stealer collects and exfiltrates not only credentials such as Browser user
data, Local files, Crypto wallets, VPN accounts, Steam accounts, Discord tokens, FileZilla
data, and Telegram session data, but also device information such as OS version, System
information, IPv4, country, and screenshot from infected PC

The collected information is stored in a temporarily created folder. After collecting
information, the folder is compressed to a *.zip file and exfiltrated through Telegram API.

Introduction of BlackGuard Stealer
BlackGuard is one of the info stealers written in C#. It is mostly distributed through malicious
software disguised as Windows Update file, Fake MS Office Installer, Computer cleaner
software, etc.
Recently, the info stealer abused the description of a YouTube video by attaching the download
link that contains the info stealer. In March 2022, a link to download a game hack program was
posted in the YouTube video description, but when users downloaded and ran the software,
44Caliber Stealer was executed on the users’ PC.

BlackGuard Stealer, which is currently being distributed, is forked from 44Caliber Stealer. Both
BlackGuard and 44Caliber use the same method to collect credentials and device information.
In addition, they store them in a temporarily created folder and compress them to the *.zip file.
But while BlackGuard uses Telegram’s sendDocument API, 44Caliber uses Discord Webhook
API to exfiltrate.

In the BlackGuard Stealer, the data used for collecting and exfiltrating credentials and device

the ChikenDir folder path, and device information. Config data is mainly used to exfiltrate

keywords for collecting files. Most of the data inside these classes are base64-encoded and

4. Anti Debugging
Before BlackGuard collects credentials and device information, it uses Anti Debugging
methods. It detects the decompiler by checking if the “dnSpy.xml” file exists, and uses “Sleep()”
and “DateTime.Now.Ticks” to determine whether it is being debugged.

5. Collect Credentials and Device Information
BlackGuard Stealer collects Browser user data, Local files, Crypto wallets, VPN, Steam,
Discord, FileZilla, Telegram, system information, and screenshot. Every time each piece of
information is collected, the number of information is counted and stored separately. The

collected data stored in the ChikenDir folder is shown in the figure below.

Browsers Folder
In the Browsers folder, each browsers’ user data is stored. A subfolder is created for each type
of browser, and the collected user data is saved as *.txt files in each folder. While Chrome and
Edge browsers’ user data includes CC, Password, Cookie, History, Downloads, and AutoFill,
and Gecko-based browsers additionally collect logins.json, which contains login information,
key3.db, and key4.db.

After storing the collected user data in each browser’s folder, BlackGuard checks and transfers
whether a specific domain is included among the *.txt files.

data, configuration data, ssnf files containing authorization information, and *.vdf file which
includes resource data.

folder.

collected information for each type, the collected target software list, and the list of detected
target domains. The message body sent to the Telegram Bot is as shown below.

Conclusion
BlackGuard Stealer has been active on the dark web forums since it appeared in January
2022.
Considering the type of information collected by BlackGuard and the recent status of
distribution, there is a possibility that it will develop into high-impact info stealers such as
Redline, Vidal, Raccoon, and Ficker.
