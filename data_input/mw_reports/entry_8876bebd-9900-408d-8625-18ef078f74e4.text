Remcos is a commercially sold Remote Adiministration Toolkit (RAT) that is regularly
distributed as Spyware
Depending on the licensing model and capabilities Remcos is sold for 58$ to 389$ by the
company (with the pretty fitting name) Breaking Security. Feature-wise the manfacturer's
website lists: Remote Administration, Support, Surveillance, Anti-Theft and Proxy. In most
cases the executable is dropped via a boobytrapped Office or XML Document. Of course I
will not link to any of their webpages or products since shilling out for cybercriminals would
be the last thing I'd do.

Inspiration for this blog post came from @wwp96 on Twitter:

Remcos uses a Control instance (the C&C) and the so-called Agent (the executable that is
delivered to the victim). It was first spotted in 2016 when it was being sold on HackForums.
Since then it was being used in targeted attacks (mostly spear-phishing) against turkish
government/military contractors or other businesses/individuals in the European Union. The
Agent is written in C++ (while the Control application is written in Borland Delphi) and is
110KB in size. Click here for the AnyRun Analysis.

Of course it fiddles around in the registry as well. It uses the Key in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to bind to the
system startup.

Although there are versions of Remcos that are packed with UPX and MPRESS1 this
sample is not obfuscated in any way.

In terms of network interactions it queries two Dynamic DNS URLs that both point to the
same host at 66.154.113[.]142

With Version 1.7 Pro we've got an old Version of the RAT in our hands which dates back to
5th of January 2017. The most recent version of the malware according to the changelog is
V2.4.7. Another thing one usually doesn't get with malware: a 31-page manual. It goes over
the features and configuation points the malware has to offer and even includes a "Terms of
Service" chapter which states that users have to be notified that there is surveillance
software in place and that the use of remcos for illegal activities is forbidden. As if they would
care that their software was probably used in >95% of malicious acts. Judging by the typos
and a few screenshots I'd attribute this malware to eastern european threat-actors.

The following Screenshots were captured after decompiling the executable with the
retargetable Decompiler retdec by Avast. The decompiled result can be found here.

As a first step it runs its dropped install script called install.bat and uses a ping to localhost to
stall the process and make sure it is finished before proceding.

In terms of Evasion techniques Remcos turns up with detection methods for both Virtualbox
and Sandboxie.The above example shows the method it employs for Virtualbox via a registry
key that is set if the Guest Additions are in place on the guest system. In the same manner it
tries to call SbieDll.dll to check if Sandboxie is present.

The Remcos Agent also has debugging functionality via a console window, for example for
the communication with the C&C Server.

Remcos also employs Process Injection via a static Mutex. This behaviour is often used as a
simple way of achieving persistence and to decrease the risk of a possible detection. Most
versions of the RAT seem to inject into svchost.exe.

5/8

Via the command & control structure we also get a pretty good look at all the features the
malware supports. In this screenshot we can see the file operations, process manipulations
and window interactions it has to offer to the operator.

Another "standard" feature for RATs is accessing Browser History, cache and password
stores. In this case Remcos is trying to manipulate user data in Mozilla Firefox.

6/8

We also get a Look at the webcam capture module of the RAT which seems to support
different camera modes. Additionally it also supports audio capture via a built-in microphone.

Lastly the malware also has the capabilities to manipulte the system power state depending
on the current priviledges.
Although Remcos is not a "new" malware by today's definition it is still a serious threat to
look out for. In my test it scores 53/68 on VirusTotal.
