Since its initial public disclosure by Vitali Kremez, MalwareHuntTeam, and others on 06
January 2020, [1] a relatively new ransomware variant referred to as EKANS by Dragos has
continued to operate against multiple, high-profile organizations. [2] Beginning in 2020, the
following organizations have experienced at least attempted intrusions, if not outright
disruption, traced to this ransomware variant:
Fresenius Group [3]
Honda [4]
Enel Group [5]
This group of identified activity likely represents a subset of behavior, as other events are
either disputed or nonpublic at this time. [6] Irrespective of specific victimology, EKANS
incorporates certain specific functionality – previously deployed via stand-alone scripts or
supporting tools [7] – directly into a ransomware executable.
As EKANS continues to develop and present itself in high-profile events, several
misconceptions and misunderstandings have developed about the malware, its authors,
and what it means for Industrial Control System (ICS) networks.
1. Why EKANS, and how does EKANS relate to Snake, or Turla activity?

2/7

When first reported in early January, the malware since referred to as EKANS by Dragos
was labeled both EKANS and SNAKE by its original discoverers. On further analysis,
Dragos referred to this malware as “EKANS” for several reasons:
1. The string “EKANS” is actually present in both the malware and in the malware’s
operations on victim machines (by creating and checking a mutex value to prevent
reinfection of the same victim).
2. While “EKANS” is “SNAKE” spelled backwards, the word “SNAKE” did not appear in
any observable aspect of the malware.
3. “SNAKE” has a long-standing relationship with an existing threat actor, referred to
variously as Turla, SNAKE, or VENOMOUS BEAR. [8] More significantly, this entity is
associated with Russian state espionage activity and not ransomware deployment.
While no consistent mechanism or convention exists for naming malware, Dragos adheres
to the practice of naming malware based on observables or details within obtained samples.
The existence of a long-running, state-sponsored threat referred to as “SNAKE” is reason
for caution in referring to a new ransomware variant by the same name, if only to avoid
confusion. Various outlets and individuals have already mistakenly made the connection
between EKANS ransomware and the Turla actor based on the “SNAKE” reference –
confusion best avoided given the possible repercussions of creating an unfounded link
between these entities.
Given the potential consequences of linking a state-sponsored or -directed entity to multiple
disruptive ransomware events, Dragos finds the use of the “SNAKE” label not just
inaccurate (as it is not present in the malware), but dangerous as well. Ultimately, EKANS
ransomware has no known, provable connection to the threat actor variously referred to as
SNAKE, Turla, VENOMOUS BEAR, or other names. While the original discoverers – Vitali
Kremez and MalwareHunterTeam – reserve the right to name this activity, given the use of
both “SNAKE” and “EKANS” in public postings and the baggage associated with the former,
Dragos emphasizes the desirability of using the latter to avoid confusion with statesponsored cyberespionage activity.
2. How does EKANS impact ICS assets?
Since discovery, several reports have emerged about EKANS’ notional abilities relative to
industrial assets. [9] While EKANS features several functional characteristics keyed to
industrial environments – specifically process kill functionality related to ICS data historians,
licensing servers, and similar items – such functionality is relatively simple, largely
untargeted (given lack of variation in the list of process names targeted between victims),
and rather blunt in design.
EKANS essentially internalizes an extensive process kill list associated with MegaCortex
ransomware activity in mid- to late-2019, and potentially associated with LockerGoga
events even earlier. Given obfuscation mechanisms deployed, use in EKANS likely
3/7

achieves a higher degree of defense evasion and functionality masking than these earlier
examples. The only functionality associated with these items is forcibly killing a named
process. This is much different than the subtle process manipulation and integrity
destruction seen (or attempted by) events such as Stuxnet, CRASHOVERRIDE, or
TRISIS. [10]
Dragos assesses with high-confidence that the process kill functionality built into EKANS is
designed primarily to remove file locks from sensitive items – such as license keys or data
stores –to extend the impact of a ransomware event by encrypting these vital files. While
deeply concerning, this is significantly different from modifications to an industrial process to
produce a potential physical disruption. Based on identified functionality, the most
concerning aspect of EKANS is that its blunt, indiscriminate process termination
functionality leads to unintended side effects in production environments.
3. Is EKANS a state-sponsored or -directed activity against critical
infrastructure?
In addition to the disambiguation with Turla provided above, other reports have surfaced
allegedly linking EKANS activity to state-sponsored activity.[11] While the potential
victimology in such reports may be accurate, ties to state-sponsored activity rely on
indefensible logical leaps that simply are not proven after further analysis. [12]
Although Dragos cannot completely or definitively disprove that EKANS is part of a statesponsored or -directed effort, the preponderance of evidence would indicate otherwise.
Among other items, connection to past ransomware activity, such as MegaCortex,
combined with subsequent victims in unrelated industries and regions suggests that EKANS
as a potential disruptive tool tied to Iranian (or other) strategic interests, is at best, a very
weak argument.
All available evidence at present indicates EKANS is a likely criminal activity designed for
monetization, and not a state-sponsored, disruptive campaign masquerading as
ransomware.
4. Given the above, is Dragos suggesting that EKANS is therefore not that
significant?
The above statement does not reflect Dragos’ position in the slightest. In evaluating items
like EKANS, we must ensure balance between over-hyping threats out of proportion and
minimizing activity so that it is not taken seriously. While EKANS is no Stuxnet or similar
threat, EKANS does not resemble some sort of “play malware” that just so happens to
feature ICS-specific references.
EKANS represents one aspect of a continued evolution by multiple ransomware entities
toward targeting industrial and critical infrastructure entities. Although relatively
straightforward in behavior and functionality, EKANS remains a notable and significant
4/7

threat to ICS operations. Even if its functionality is relatively “basic” in being limited to
process termination, such activity performed at the wrong time or against the wrong system
could lead to potentially disastrous process interruption. Although not designed to physically
disrupt or destroy, malware such as EKANS brings the possibility of ICS-specific impacts
from traditionally state-directed activity to likely criminally-motivated actions.
Given the above, asset owners and operators should treat EKANS as a serious threat, and
as a likely sign of continued evolution in ransomware operations. Malicious entities continue
to refine their operations to target entities ranging from manufacturers through critical
infrastructure providers, such as power and water utility companies. Such shifts are likely
due to assumptions on the need to pay a ransom to ensure continuous operation by vital
entities. Irrespective of motivation, ICS asset owners and operators are at increasing risk of
ever more refined malware operations targeting their organizations. Discounting the threat
posed by items such as EKANS due to a perceived lack of sophistication is not merely
misguided but may potentially lead to operational disaster.
ICS asset owners and operators find themselves in an increasingly contested environment,
with both state sponsored and criminally motivated entities interested in this operational
space. To combat such efforts, organizations must invest in increasing visibility – across
network, host, and process areas – and the ability to respond and remediate potential
disruptions. Only by identifying potential threats at the earliest possible instance and having
the capacity to recover and restore operations to a recent known-good state can industrial
operators forge resilience in the face of an ever-more hostile threat landscape.
