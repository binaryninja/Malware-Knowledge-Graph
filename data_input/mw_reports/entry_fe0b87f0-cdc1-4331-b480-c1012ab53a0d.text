APPLYING THE LATEST STANDARD FOR FUNCTIONAL
SAFETY — IEC 61511
A G Foord, W G Gulland, C R Howard, T Kellacher, W H Smith (4-sight Consulting)
This paper focuses on a technique for risk assessment, Layer of Protection Analysis
(LOPA), that is relatively new to Europe and compares it with two established
techniques: Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) and Risk Graphs. It describes our
experience in applying the latest standard for functional safety “BS IEC 61511:
2003 Functional Safety – Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) for the Process Industry
Sector”1. The main lessons learned are illustrated by real examples, changed to
preserve confidentiality but still illustrating relevant issues.

INTRODUCTION
“Functional” and “safety” are words that have been used for centuries and, although using
“functional safety” to describe the action of a protection system is a relatively recent
innovation, the meaning is clear enough. Other terms used are less obvious and are
defined in the standard and repeated below for those not familiar with them. This paper
discusses the application of three popular methods of determining Safety Integrity
Level (SIL) requirements — Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), risk graph methods
and Layer Of Protection Analysis (LOPA) — to process industry installations. It identifies
some of the advantages and limitations of each method and suggests criteria for identifying
which of these methods is appropriate in specific situations.

DEFINITIONS
IEC 61511 covers the whole lifecycle as shown in Figure 1, but this paper is concerned
only with phases 1 through 3, leading to the “Safety Requirements Specification for the
Safety Instrumented System”.

LAYERS OF PROTECTION
The introduction of the layers of protection concept shown in Figure 2 originates from the
American approach to Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in ANSI ISA-SP 84.01–19963.
This American standard has been the major influence in the differences between IEC
615084 and IEC 61511 and the importance of independence between layers and the implications of common cause issues between layers is emphasised. The allocation of safety
functions to specific layers or systems (for example a hazard may be protected by a
combination of relief valves, physical barriers and bunds and a SIS); and the contribution
required of each element to the overall risk reduction should be specified as part of the

transfer of information from the risk analysis to those responsible for the design
and engineering.

BPCS
The Basic Process Control System (BPCS) is a key layer of protection “which responds to
input signals from the process, its associated equipment, other programmable systems
and/or operator and generates output signals causing the process and its associated equipment to operate in the desired manner but which does not perform any safety instrumented
functions with a claimed SIL 1”. Note that in IEC 61508 the BPCS is part of the
definition of Equipment Under Control (EUC).

SIF
A Safety Instrumented Function (SIF) is a safety function with a specified SIL which is
necessary to achieve functional safety. IEC 61511 also includes a note to explain that
this normally refers to protection systems and that if it is applied to control systems

SYMPOSIUM SERIES No. 150

then “further detailed analysis may be required to demonstrate that the system is capable of
achieving the safety requirements”.
SIS
A Safety Instrumented System (SIS) is used to implement one or more SIFs. A SIS is composed of any combination of sensor(s), logic solver(s), and final element(s).
SIL
The two standards (IEC 61508 and IEC 61511) define Safety Integrity as “probability” of
success and then define the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) as four discrete levels (1 to 4)
3

# 2004 IChemE

SYMPOSIUM SERIES No. 150

such that “level 4 has the highest safety integrity”. Although the standards concentrate on
“Safety” and “SIL”, the principles that they address can also be applied to protection
against environmental and financial risks; “EIL” and “FIL” can be applied analogously
with “SIL”, and Integrity Level (IL) used as a term applying to all three protection
functions.
The definition of SIL is clear for those SIFs that are only called upon at a low
frequency/have a low demand rate. Elsewhere the same two standards recognise that
safety functions can be required to operate in quite different ways (for example, continuously) and SIL is defined as a failure rate (in units of failures/hour). These two different
uses of the same SIL terminology have caused considerable confusion. This section of this
paper was first presented at the Safety-Critical Systems Symposium in February 2004
(SSS04)2 and attempts to clarify the definition of SIL. Consider a car; examples of low
demand functions are:
. Anti-lock braking (ABS). (It depends on the driver, of course!).
. Secondary restraint system (air bags).
On the other hand there are functions that are in frequent or continuous use;
examples of such functions are:
. Normal braking
. Steering
The fundamental question is how frequently will failures of either type of function
lead to accidents. The answer is different for the 2 types:
. For functions with a low demand rate, the accident rate is a combination of 2
parameters — i) the frequency of demands, and ii) the Probability the function Fails
on Demand (PFD). In this case, therefore, the appropriate measure of performance
of the function is PFD, or its reciprocal, Risk Reduction Factor (RRF).
. For functions that have a high demand rate or operate continuously, the accident rate is
the failure rate, l, which is the appropriate measure of performance. An alternative
measure is Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of the function. Provided failures are exponentially distributed, MTTF is the reciprocal of l.
These performance measures are, of course, related. At its simplest, provided the
function can be proof-tested at a frequency that is greater than the demand rate, the
relationship can be expressed as:
or
PFD ¼ lT=2
RRF ¼ 2=(lT) or

¼ T=(2  MTTF), or
¼ (2  MTTF)=T

where T is the proof-test interval. (Note that to significantly reduce the accident rate below
the failure rate of the function, the test frequency, 1/T, should be at least 2 and preferably
5 times the demand frequency.) They are, however, different quantities. PFD is a
4

# 2004 IChemE

SYMPOSIUM SERIES No. 150

probability — dimensionless; l is a rate — dimension t21. The standards, however, use the
same term — SIL — for both these measures, with the following definitions:
In low demand mode, SIL is a proxy for PFD; in high demand/continuous mode,
SIL is a proxy for failure rate. (The boundary between low demand mode and high
demand/continuous mode is in essence set in the standards at one demand per year.
This is consistent with proof-test intervals of 3 to 6 months, which in many cases will
be the shortest feasible interval.)
Now consider a function which protects against 2 different hazards, one of which
occurs at a rate of 1 every 2 weeks, or 25 times per year, i.e. a high demand rate, and
the other at a rate of 1 in 10 years, i.e. a low demand rate. If the MTTF of the function
is 50 years, it would qualify as achieving SIL1 for the high demand rate hazard. The
high demands effectively proof-test the function against the low demand rate hazard.
All else being equal, the effective achieved SIL for the second hazard is given by:
PFD ¼ 0:04=(2  50) ¼ 4  104 ; SIL3
So what is the SIL achieved by the function? Clearly it is not unique, but depends on
the hazard and in particular whether the demand rate for the hazard implies low or high
demand mode.
In the first case, the achievable SIL is intrinsic to the equipment; in the second case,
although the intrinsic quality of the equipment is important, the achievable SIL is also
affected by the testing regime. This is important in the process industry sector, where
achievable SILs are liable to be dominated by the reliability of field equipment —
process measurement instruments and, particularly, final elements such as shutdown
valves — which need to be regularly tested to achieve required SILs.
The difference between these two definitions of SIL often leads to mis-understandings.
CONCEPTS OF RESIDUAL RISK, RISK REDUCTION AND REQUIRED SIL
Both IEC 61508 & 61511 imply that the only action of a SIS is to reduce the frequency or
likelihood of a hazard. Thus the model of risk (reproduced in Figure 3) is one-dimensional.
All the methods of determining SIL are based on similar principles:
Step 1 Identify the “process risk” from the process and the BPCS
Step 2 Identify the “tolerable risk” for the particular process
Step 3 If the process risk exceeds the tolerable risk, then calculate the necessary risk
reduction and whether the protection layers will operate in continuous or
demand mode
Step 4 Identify the risk reduction factors achieved by other protection layers
Step 5 Calculate the remaining risk reduction factor (RRF) or the failure rate that should
be achieved by the SIS and thus from Table 1 or 2 the required SIL
The residual risk is the process risk reduced by all the risk reduction factors and will
normally be less than the tolerable risk. Identifying the tolerable risk is a major issue that is

discussed in Reducing Risks, Protecting People (R2P2)5 and is beyond the scope of this
paper. Identifying the frequencies of all initiating causes (or the demand rates used in
Steps 1 & 3 above) is also difficult unless excellent records of all incidents are available.
SOME METHODS OF DETERMINING SIL REQUIREMENTS
IEC 61508 OFFERS 3 METHODS OF DETERMINING SIL REQUIREMENTS:
. Quantitative method.
. Risk graph, described in the standard as a qualitative method.
. Hazardous event severity matrix, also described as a qualitative method.

This column is not part of the standards, but the authors have found
these approximate MTTF values to be useful in the process industry
sector, where time tends to be measured in years rather than hours.

IEC 61511 OFFERS:
. Semi-quantitative method (incorporating the use of fault and event trees).
. Safety layer matrix method, described as a semi-qualitative method.
. Calibrated risk graph, described in the standard as a semi-qualitative method, but by
some practitioners as a semi-quantitative method.
. Risk graph, described as a qualitative method.
. Layer of protection analysis (LOPA). (Although the standard does not assign this
method a position on the qualitative/quantitative scale, it is weighted toward the
quantitative end.)
These are developments and extensions of the methods originally outlined in IEC
61508-5. They have all been used by various organisations in the determination of
SILs, but with varying degrees of success and acceptability; and do not provide an exhaustive list of all the possible methods of risk assessment. All of these methods require some
degree of tailoring to meet the requirements of an individual company, together with training of the personnel who will apply them, before they can be used successfully. QRA, risk
graphs and LOPA are established methods for determining SIL requirements, particularly
in the process industry sector, but LOPA is less well known in the UK and is the focus of
this paper.
TYPICAL RESULTS
As one would expect, there is wide variation from installation to installation in the
numbers of functions that are assessed as requiring SIL ratings, but the numbers in
Table 3 were assessed for a reasonably typical offshore gas platform. Typically in the
process sector there might be a single SIL3 requirement in an application of this size,
while identification of SIL4 requirements is very rare. If a SIL3 or SIL4 requirement is
identified it is reasonable to investigate the use made of the basic process design and

other protection layers in risk reduction and whether undue reliance is being placed on the
SIS; and indicates a serious need for redesign.

AFTER-THE-EVENT PROTECTION
Some functions on process plants are invoked “after-the-event”, i.e. after a loss of containment, after a fire has started or an explosion has occurred. Fire and gas detection and
emergency shutdown are the principal examples of such functions. Assessment of the
required SILs of such functions presents specific problems:
. Because they operate after the event, there may already have been consequences that
they can do nothing to prevent or mitigate. The initial consequences must be separated
from the later consequences.
. The event may develop and escalate to a number of different eventual outcomes with a
range of consequence severity, depending on a number of intermediate events. Analysis of the likelihood of each outcome is a specialist task, often based on event trees
(Figure 4).

QRA
Quantitative Risk Assessment is usually done with Fault Trees and Event Trees or
Reliability Block Diagrams (RBDs). Some people refer to a combination of Fault and
Event Tree as a Cause-Consequence Diagram. Figure 4 shows an example of an Event
Tree and Figures 5 and 6 show a Fault Tree and a RBD. Normally the “Top Event”
will be a particular hazard and provided that:
. appropriate failure models are chosen for each basic event or block;
. accurate data is available for the particular environment for each of the failure modes,
repairs and tests; and
. all the relationships are correctly modelled; then

the frequency at which the hazard occurs, and hence the risk can be calculated (see textbooks, for example6). The successful outcome of a QRA is highly dependent on the
assumptions that are made, the detail of the model developed to represent the hazardous
event and the data that is used. However well a QRA has been done it does not provide
an absolute indication of the residual risk. A sensitivity analysis of the data and assumptions is a fundamental element of any QRA.

RISK GRAPH METHODS
Figure 7 shows a typical risk graph. The risk graph method is described in both IEC
61508 & 61511 and is an excellent means of quickly assessing and screening a large
number of safety functions so as to allow effort to be focused on the small percentage
of critical functions. The advantages and disadvantages and range of applicability of
risk graphs are the main topic of a previous paper by W G Gulland at SSS042. The
results of that paper are given in the conclusions below. In use the risk graph needs
calibration to align with a company’s corporate risk criteria.
A serious limitation of the risk graph method is that it does not lend itself at all well
to assessing “after the event” outcomes:
. Demand rates would be expected to be very low, e.g. 1 in 1,000 to 10,000 years. This is
off the scale of most of the risk graphs used.

SYMPOSIUM SERIES No. 150

. The range of outcomes from function to function may be very large, from a single
injured person to major loss of life. The outcomes are also potentially random depending on a wide range of circumstances. Where large-scale consequences are possible,
use of such a coarse tool such as the risk graph method can hardly be considered
“suitable” and “sufficient”.
The QRA and the LOPA methods do not have these limitations, particularly if the
LOPA method is applied quantitatively and, as such, are more suited to analysing “after
the event” outcomes.
LAYER OF PROTECTION ANALYSIS (LOPA)
The LOPA method was developed by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers as a
method of assessing the SIL requirements of SIFs (see textbooks, for example7).
The method starts with a list of all the process hazards on an installation as identified
by Hazard And Operability Studies (HAZOPs) or other hazard identification techniques.
The hazards are analysed in terms of:

. Estimate of consequence severity (“Severity Level”)
. Description of all causes which could lead to the Impact Event (“Initiating Causes”)
. Estimate of frequency of all Initiating Causes (“Initiation Likelihood”)
The Severity Level may be expressed in semi-quantitative terms, linked to target
Mitigated Event Likelihoods expressed as target frequency ranges (analogous to tolerable
risk levels), as shown in Table 4; or it may be expressed as a specific quantitative estimate
of harm, which can be referenced to F-N curves.
Similarly, the Initiation Likelihood may be expressed semi-quantitatively, as shown
in Table 5; or it may be expressed as a specific quantitative estimate.
The strength of the method is that it recognises that in the process industries there
are usually several layers of protection against an Initiating Cause leading to an Impact
Event. Specifically, it identifies:
. General Process Design. There may, for example, be aspects of the design that reduce
the probability of loss of containment, or of ignition if containment is lost, so reducing
the probability of a fire or explosion event.
. Basic Process Control System (BPCS). Failure of a process control loop is likely to be
one of the main Initiating Causes. However, there may be another independent control
loop that could prevent the Impact Event, and so reduce the frequency of that event.

. Alarms. Provided there is an alarm that is independent of the BPCS, sufficient time for
an operator to respond, and an effective action to take (a “handle” to “pull”), credit can
be taken for alarms to reduce the probability of the Impact Event up to a RRF of 10.
. Additional Mitigation, Restricted Access. Even if the Impact Event occurs, there may
be limits on the occupation of the hazardous area (equivalent to the F parameter in the
risk graph method), or effective means of escape from the hazardous area (equivalent to
the P parameter in the risk graph method), which reduce the Severity Level of the event.
. Independent Protection Layers (IPLs). A number of criteria must be satisfied by an
IPL to be assured that it is genuinely independent of other protective layers and
achieves RRF 10. Relief valves and bursting disks usually qualify for RRF 100.
Based on the Initiating Likelihood (frequency) and the PFDs of all the protection
layers listed above, an Intermediate Event Likelihood (frequency) for the Impact Event
and the Initiating Event can be calculated. The process must be completed for all Initiating
Events, to determine a total Intermediate Event Likelihood for all Initiating Events. This
can then be compared with the target Mitigated Event Likelihood (frequency). So far no
credit has been taken for any SIF. The ratio:
(Intermediate Event Likelihood)/(Mitigated Event Likelihood)
gives the required RRF (or 1/PFD) of the SIF, and can be converted to a required SIL
using Table 1. Alternatively the inverse ratio
(Mitigated Event Likelihood)/(Intermediate Event Likelihood)
gives the required PFD of the SIF that can be converted to a required SIL using Table 1.
EXAMPLES OF LOPA
COMPRESSOR (AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 8)
Key assumptions for LOPA of overpressure protection for a compressor
driven by a gas turbine
Overpressure of the piping downstream of compression could result in the release of significant quantities of flammable gas within or outside the compressor building.
The study team focused only on the explosion hazard as this had the more significant
consequences. Three cases were considered for high pressure:
. Case A: a sudden increase in pressure from the source of gas.
. Case B: closing a control, shutdown or isolation valve in the piping, or equipment
downstream of the compressor.
. Case C: a failure of the BPCS.
The study team used the values for Individual Risk Per Annum (IRPA) (see R2P2)5
defined in the Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) safety report for the most

exposed person. The As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) region (see R2P2)5 was
defined as IRPA in the range 1023 to 1026.
There are no occupied buildings on the neighbouring sites within 100 m of the
compressor building. Staff are required not to stay within the compressor building for
longer than 15 minutes at a time and for 20 minutes in one day (unless it is shutdown).
There may be one or two staff exposed for 10– 20 minutes each day in the compressor
building (giving a severity of Serious). The compressor building is classified as a hazardous area, with explosion proof equipment and no exposed hot surfaces.
Results of LOPA study
The study team assumed an IRPA Mitigated event target likelihood of 1027. The worst
case Intermediate event likelihood was 1022 and thus a Safety Instrument Function
(SIF) Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) of 1025 is required. The details of the
other figures are shown in Table 6. Severity levels are specified as C ¼ Catastrophic,
E ¼ Extensive, S ¼ Serious, M ¼ Minor; and likelihood values are events per year.
Other numerical values are probabilities of failure on demand average.
Layer of protection analysis (LOPA)
Some of the results of the LOPA are shown in Table 6.

PIPELINE
The Pipeline studied contained a liquid that would evaporate if released and had Passive
Fire Protection (PFP). Two of the impact events considered were Jet Fires and a Boiling
Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (BLEVE). Some of the results of the LOPA are
shown in Table 7.

DISCUSSION OF ALL THREE METHODS
QRA
Page 31 of R2P25 states that “The use of numerical estimates of risk by themselves can, for
several reasons . . . , be misleading and lead to decisions which do not meet adequate levels
of safety. In general, qualitative learning and numerical estimates from QRA should be
combined with other information from engineering and operational analyses in making
an overall decision.”
Fault Trees, Event Trees and RBDs are very valuable in showing relationships
between different parts of the process, the BPCS and the protection systems. However,
there are difficulties in obtaining good data for all the relevant failure modes as many
business sector reliability databases have not been maintained. Therefore numerical estimates of risk will take the form of a range and judgement will be required to assess a
realistic figure.
The problems with the data also apply if LOPA is used for quantitative assessments.

RISK GRAPHS
The implications of the issues highlighted by W G Gulland at SSS042 are:
. Risk graphs are very useful but imprecise tools for assessing SIL requirements. (It is
inevitable that a method with 5 parameters — C, F, P, W and SIL — each with a range
of an order of magnitude, will produce a result with a range of 5 orders of magnitude.)
. They must be calibrated on a conservative basis to avoid the danger that they underestimate the unprotected risk and the amount of risk reduction/protection required.
. Their use is most appropriate when a number of functions protect against different
hazards, which are themselves only a small proportion of the overall total hazards,
so that it is very likely that under-estimates and over-estimates of residual risk will
average out when they are aggregated. Only in these circumstances can the method
be realistically described as providing a “suitable” and “sufficient”, and therefore
legal, risk assessment.
. Higher SIL requirements (SIL2þ) incur significant capital costs (for redundancy and
rigorous engineering requirements) and operating costs (for applying rigorous maintenance procedures to more equipment, and for proof-testing more equipment at
higher frequencies, and to rigorously gather and analyse performance data). They
should therefore be re-assessed using a more refined method.

Table 8. Advantages and disadvantages of QRA, risk graph and LOPA methods

Advantages:
1. Can be applied to complex systems and
many different models of failures.
2. Can be performed by an individual.
3. The FTA and RBD diagrams show the
relationships between sub-systems and
dependencies within the overall system.
4. Gives a numerical result.
5. Tools are available for both FTA and
RBDs.
6. Can be used to assess the requirements of
after-the-event functions.

Advantages:
1. Can be applied relatively
rapidly to a large number of
functions to eliminate those
with little or no safety role,
and highlight those with
larger safety roles.
2. Can be performed as a team
exercise involving a range of
disciplines and expertise.

Disadvantages:
1. The precision may be an illusion,
particularly in the assessment of human
factors.
2. The assessment has to be reviewed by
those who understand FTA and RBD.
3. The method is very time-consuming.

Disadvantages:
1. An imprecise method, which
is only appropriate to
functions where the residual
risk is very low compared to
the target total risk.
2. The assessment has to be
adjusted in various ways to
take account of other risk
mitigation measures such as
alarms and mechanical
protection devices.
3. Does not lend itself to the
assessment of after-the-event
functions.

Advantages:
1. Can be used both as a filtering tool and for
more precise analysis.
2. Can be performed as a team exercise, at
least for a semi-quantitative assessment.
3. Facilitates the identification of all relevant
risk mitigation measures, and taking
credit for them in the assessment.
4. When used quantitatively, uncertainty
about residual risk levels can be reduced,
so that the assessment does not need to be
so conservative.
5. Can be used to assess the requirements of
after-the-event functions.
Disadvantages:
1. Relatively slow compared to risk graph
methods, even when used semiquantitatively.
2. Not so easy to perform as a team exercise,
makes heavier demands on team
members’ time, and not so visual.

LOPA
The LOPA method has the following advantages:
. It can be used semi-quantitatively or quantitatively.
B
Used semi-quantitatively it has many of the same advantages as risk graph
methods.
B
Used quantitatively the logic of the analysis can still be developed as a team
exercise, with the detail developed “off-line” by specialists.
. It explicitly accounts for risk mitigating factors, such as alarms and relief valves,
which have to be incorporated as adjustments into risk graph methods (e.g. by reducing
the W value to take credit for alarms, by reducing the SIL to take credit for relief
valves).
. A semi-quantitative analysis of a high SIL function can be promoted to a quantitative
analysis without changing the format.
. It can assist in all the team members obtaining and sharing a full appreciation of the
issues and uncertainties associated with the hazardous event(s).
CONCLUSIONS
To summarise, the relative advantages and disadvantages of these methods are shown in
Table 8, and as can be seen from Table 8 there is no ideal candidate to cover all requirements — an assessment has to be made as to the most appropriate method for a specific
requirement. Should the total number of functions requiring assessment be small (,10)
and acceptable reliability data available then our experience would be to apply LOPA
in a semi-quantitative manner. However on new installations the number of functions
identified in the HAZOP as requiring a SIF can be very large requiring the involvement
of critical people in a team activity over a considerable period of time. Sufficient time
for this is a rare commodity these days and, in such a situation, we would recommend
the use of risk graphs initially for all required functions (approx. 25 functions assessed
per day on average) and then repeat the assessment using LOPA for those functions
assessed as IL2 (approx. 5 functions assessed per day on average).
Whatever process of analysis is applied they all require a corporate risk policy defining what risk level is deemed acceptable from both individual and societal perspectives —
a politically sensitive decision has to be agreed within any business organisation, with an
acute awareness of the perception of risk held by the general public.
Whilst the standards IEC 61508/61511 only relate to Safety of people there is little
doubt that the Environmental agencies will require businesses focus to improve the environment whilst stake-holders will require similar attention to commercial performance.
