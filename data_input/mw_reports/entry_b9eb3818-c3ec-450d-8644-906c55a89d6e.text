Updated on May 10, 2017, 6:52 PM (UTC-7): We updated the source code and made
changes to Figures 4 and 6.
A new Internet of Things (IoT) botnet called Persirai (Detected by Trend Micro
as ELF_PERSIRAI.A) has been discovered targeting over 1,000 Internet Protocol (IP)
Camera models based on various Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products. This
development comes on the heels of Mirai—an open-source backdoor malware that caused
some of the most notable incidents of 2016 via Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
that compromised IoT devices such as Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) and CCTV cameras
—as well as the Hajime botnet.
We detected approximately 120,000 IP cameras that are vulnerable to ELF_PERSIRAI.A via
Shodan. Many of these vulnerable users are unaware that their IP Cameras are exposed to
the internet.

data)
This makes it significantly easier for the perpetrators behind the malware to gain access to
the IP Camera web interface via TCP Port 81.
Behavior and Analysis
Figure 1
Figure 2: Infection Flow of ELF_PERSIRAI.A
IP Cameras typically use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which are network protocols that
allow devices to open a port on the router and act like a server, making them highly visible
targets for IoT malware.
After logging into the vulnerable interface, the attacker can perform a command injection to
force the IP Camera to connect to a download site via the following command:
Figure 1
The download site will then respond with the following commands:
Figure 1
These commands will download and execute malicious shell script from the domain
ntp.gtpnet.ir T
he wificam.sh will download and execute the following samples, which will be deleted after
execution:
Figure 1
After the samples are downloaded and executed, the malware deletes itself and will only run
in memory. It will also block the zero-day exploit by pointing ftpupdate.sh and ftpupload.sh to
/dev/null to prevent other attackers from targeting the victim’s IP Camera. However, once the
camera is rebooted, it will again be vulnerable to the exploit.
The affected IP Camera will report to the C&C servers:
load[.]gtpnet[.]ir
ntp[.]gtpnet[.]ir
185[.]62[.]189[.]232
95[.]85[.]38[.]103

After receiving commands from the server, the IP Camera will then start automatically
attacking other IP Cameras by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability that was made public a few
months ago. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability will be able to get the password file from
the user, providing them the means to do command injections regardless of password
strength.
A sample of the payload is shown below:
Figure 1
Figure 3: ELF_PERSIRAI.A sample payload
The IP Camera will then receive a command from the C&C server, instructing it to perform a
DDoS attack on other computers via User Datagram Protocol (UDP) floods. Notably, Persirai
can perform User Datagram Protocol (UDP) DDoS attack with SSDP packets without
spoofing IP address.
The backdoor protocol can be seen below:

The red portions indicate communication from C&C server to the victim’s IP camera. It
contains the attack commands and DDoS target IP and port.

C&C servers we discovered were found to be using the IR country code. We also found
some special Persian characters which the malware author used.
The IP Camera manufacturer for the sample we used claimed that the latest firmware
addressed the vulnerability, so we tried updating the firmware of the IP Camera. However,
the firmware indicates that it is already using the latest version.

Conclusion and Mitigation
Aside from being the first malware that brought IoT security into the limelight, we also noted
how Mirai’s open-source nature gave it the potential to act as the core template upon which
future IoT-centric malware will be built upon.

As the Internet of Things gains traction with ordinary users, cybercriminals may choose to
move away from Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Domain Name System (DNS) servers for
DDoS attacks, instead concentrating on vulnerable devices—an issue compounded by users
that practice lax security measures.
A large number of these attacks were caused by the use of the default password in the
device interface. Thus, users should change their default password as soon as possible and
use a strong password for their devices.
However, as seen in the presence of the password-stealing vulnerability mentioned above, a
strong password alone does not guarantee device security. IP Camera owners should also
implement other steps to ensure that their devices are protected from external attacks. In
addition to using a strong password, users should also disable UPnP on their routers to
prevent devices within the network from opening ports to the external Internet without any
warning.
The burden of IoT security does not rest on the user alone—it's also dependent on the
vendors themselves, as they should be the ones responsible for making sure that their
devices are secure and always updated. In line with this, users should make sure that their
devices are always updated with the latest firmware to minimize the chance of vulnerability
exploits.
Trend Micro Solutions
In addition to the best practices mentioned above, users can look into solutions such as
Trend Micro™ Security and Trend Micro Internet Security, which offer effective protection for
threat’s to IoT devices using security features that can detect malware at the endpoint level.
Connected devices are protected by security solutions such as Trend Micro Home Network
Security, which can check internet traffic between the router and all connected devices. In
addition, enterprises can monitor all ports and network protocols to detect advanced threats
and protect from targeted attacks via Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Inspector .
