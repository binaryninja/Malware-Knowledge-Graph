Zero Day Threats

1/9

Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed multiple instances of
abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment. The observed
activity included creation of web shells for persistent access, remote code execution, and
reconnaissance for endpoint security solutions. Our investigation revealed that the files
created on the Exchange servers were owned by the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, a
privileged local account on the Windows operating system. Furthermore, the process that
created the web shell was UMWorkerProcess.exe, the process responsible for Exchange
Server’s Unified Messaging Service. In subsequent investigations, we observed malicious
files created by w3wp.exe, the process responsible for the Exchange Server web front-end.
In response to this activity, we built threat hunting campaigns designed to identify additional
Exchange Server abuse. We also utilized this data to build higher-fidelity detections of web
server process chains. On March 2, 2021, Microsoft released a blog post that detailed
multiple zero-day vulnerabilities used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange
Server. Microsoft also issued emergency Exchange Server updates for the following
vulnerabilities:

The activity reported by Microsoft aligns with our observations. FireEye currently tracks
this activity in three clusters, UNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643. We anticipate
additional clusters as we respond to intrusions. We recommend following Microsoft’s
guidance and patching Exchange Server immediately to mitigate this activity.
Based on our telemetry, we have identified an array of affected victims including US-based
retailers, local governments, a university, and an engineering firm. Related activity may also
include a Southeast Asian government and Central Asian telecom. Microsoft reported the
2/9

exploitation occurred together and is linked to a single group of actors tracked as
“HAFNIUM”, a group that has previously targeted the US-based defense companies, law
firms, infectious disease researchers, and think tanks.
In this blog post, we will detail our observations on the active investigations we are currently
performing. As our experience with and knowledge of this threat actor grows, we will update
this post or release new technical details as appropriate. For our Managed Defense
Customers, we have launched a Community Protection Event that will provide frequent
updates on this threat actor and activity.
We will be discussing these attacks more in an upcoming webinar on Mar. 17, 2021.
From Exploit to Web Shell
Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed the creation of web shells
on one Microsoft Exchange server file system within a customer’s environment. The web
shell, named help.aspx (MD5: 4b3039cf227c611c45d2242d1228a121), contained code to
identify the presence of (1) FireEye xAgent, (2) CarbonBlack, or (3) CrowdStrike Falcon
endpoint products and write the output of discovery. Figure 1 provides a snippet of the web
shell’s code.

The web shell was written to the system by the UMWorkerProcess.exe process, which is
associated with Microsoft Exchange Server’s Unified Messaging service. This activity
suggested exploitation of CVE-2021-26858.
Approximately twenty days later, the attacker placed another web shell on a separate
Microsoft Exchange Server. This second, partially obfuscated web shell, named iisstart.aspx
(MD5: 0fd9bffa49c76ee12e51e3b8ae0609ac), was more advanced and contained functions
to interact with the file system. As seen in Figure 2, the web shell included the ability to run
arbitrary commands and upload, delete, and view the contents of files.

While the use of web shells is common amongst threat actors, the parent processes, timing,
and victim(s) of these files clearly indicate activity that commenced with the abuse of
Microsoft Exchange.
In March 2021, in a separate environment, we observed a threat actor utilize one or more
vulnerabilities to place at least one web shell on the vulnerable Exchange Server. This was
likely to establish both persistence and secondary access, as in other environments. In this
case, Mandiant observed the process w3wp.exe, (the IIS process associated with the
Exchange web front-end) spawning cmd.exe to write a file to disk. The file, depicted in Figure
3, matches signatures for the tried-and-true China Chopper.

We observed that in at least two cases, the threat actors subsequently issued the following
command against the Exchange web server:
net group "Exchange Organization administrators" administrator /del /domain.
This command attempts to delete the administrator user from the Exchange Organizations
administrators group, beginning with the Domain Controller in the current domain. If the
system is in a single-system domain, it will execute on the local computer.
Per Microsoft’s blog, they have identified additional post-exploitation activities, including:
Credential theft via dumping of LSASS process memory.
Compression of data for exfiltration via 7-Zip.

6/9

Use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins to export mailbox data.
Use of additional offensive security tools Covenant, Nishang, and PowerCat for remote
access.
The activity we have observed, coupled with others in the information security industry,
indicate that these threat actors are likely using Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain a
foothold into environments. This activity is followed quickly by additional access and
persistent mechanisms. As previously stated, we have multiple ongoing cases and will
continue to provide insight as we respond to intrusions.
Investigation Tips
We recommend checking the following for potential evidence of compromise:
Child processes of C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\w3wp.exe on Exchange Servers,
particularly cmd.exe.
Files written to the system by w3wp.exe or UMWorkerProcess.exe.
ASPX files owned by the SYSTEM user
New, unexpected compiled ASPX files in the Temporary ASP.NET Files directory
Reconnaissance, vulnerability-testing requests to the following resources from an
external IP address:
/rpc/ directory
/ecp/DDI/DDIService.svc/SetObject
Non-existent resources
With suspicious or spoofed HTTP User-Agents
Unexpected or suspicious Exchange PowerShell SnapIn requests to export mailboxes
In our investigations to date, the web shells placed on Exchange Servers have been named
differently in each intrusion, and thus the file name alone is not a high-fidelity indicator of
compromise.
If you believe your Exchange Server was compromised, we recommend investigating to
determine the scope of the attack and dwell time of the threat actor.
Furthermore, as system and web server logs may have time or size limits enforced, we
recommend preserving the following artifacts for forensic analysis:
At least 14 days of HTTP web logs from the inetpub\Logs\LogFiles directories (include
logs from all subdirectories)
The contents of the Exchange Web Server (also found within the inetpub folder)
At least 14 days of Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs, located in Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\v15\Logging\ECP\Server
Microsoft Windows event logs

7/9

We have found significant hunting and analysis value in these log folders, especially for
suspicious CMD parameters in the ECP Server logs. We will continue updating technical
details as we observe more related activity.
Technical Indicators
The following are technical indicators we have observed, organized by the threat groups we
currently associate with this activity. To increase investigation transparency, we are including
a Last Known True, or LKT, value for network indicators. The LKT timestamp indicates the
last time Mandiant knew the indicator was associated with the adversary; however, as with
all ongoing intrusions, a reasonable time window should be considered.
