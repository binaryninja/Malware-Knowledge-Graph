China’s Cyber Warfare Capabilities
Desmond Ball
China has the most extensive and most practised cyber-warfare capabilities in Asia. This article
describes the development of these capabilities since the mid-1990s, the intelligence and
military organisations involved, and the particular capabilities that have been demonstrated in
defence exercises and in attacks on computer systems and networks in other countries. It
notes that it is often very difficult to determine whether these attacks have originated with official
agencies or private „Netizens‟. It argues that China‟s own computer systems and networks are
replete with vulnerabilities, of which Chinese officials are well aware. It concludes that this
appreciation of China‟s deficiencies and vulnerabilities has led to the adoption of a pre-emptive
strategy, as practiced in People‟s Liberation Army exercises, in which China‟s very destructive
but relatively unsophisticated cyber-warfare capabilities are unleashed at the very outset of
prospective conflicts.

China has the most extensive and most practiced cyber-warfare capabilities
in Asia, although the technical expertise is very uneven. China began to
implement an Information Warfare (IW) plan in 1995, and since 1997 has
conducted numerous exercises in which computer viruses have been used
to interrupt military communications and public broadcasting systems. In
April 1997, a 100-member elite corps was set up by the Central Military
Commission to devise “ways of planting disabling computer viruses into
1
American and other Western command and control defence systems”. In
2000, China established a strategic IW unit (which US observers have called
„Net Force‟) designed to “wage combat through computer networks to
manipulate enemy information systems spanning spare parts deliveries to
2
fire control and guidance systems”. The People‟s Liberation Army (PLA)
announced on 20 July 2010 that it had established an „Information Protection
Base‟ under the General Staff Department. This is probably a „computer
3
network defence‟ or „computer security operations‟ centre.
Chinese cyber-warfare units have been very active, although it is often very
difficult to attribute activities originating in China to official agencies or private
„Netizens‟ („WangMin‟). Since 1999, there have been periodic rounds of
attacks against official Web-sites in Taiwan, Japan and the United States.
These have typically involved fairly basic penetrations, allowing Web-sites to

be defaced or servers to be crashed by „Denial-of-Service‟ (DOS) programs.
More sophisticated „Trojan Horse‟ programs were used in 2002 to penetrate
4
and steal information from the Dalai Lama‟s computer network.
More
recently, Trojan Horse programs camouflaged as Microsoft Word and
PowerPoint documents have been inserted in computers in government
5
offices in many countries around the world. Portable, large-capacity hard
discs, often used by government agencies, have been found to carry Trojan
Horses that automatically upload to Beijing Web-sites everything that the
6
computer user saves on the hard disc. From the late 1990s until 2005, the
PLA conducted more than 100 military exercises involving some aspect of
7
IW, although the practice generally exposed substantial short-falls.
A
similar number was probably conducted in the period from 2005 to 2010.
Any critique of China‟s cyber-warfare capabilities must necessarily include
some assessment of its cyber-intelligence operations. As a report prepared
for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in October
2009 noted:
Ultimately, the only distinction between computer network exploitation and
attack is the intent of the operator at the keyboard. The skill sets needed to
penetrate a network for intelligence gathering purposes in peacetime are the
same skills necessary to penetrate that network for offensive action during
wartime.8

And as Admiral Robert Willard, the Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific
Command (CINCPAC) told the Congress on 13 January 2010, “U.S. military
and government networks and computer systems continue to be the target of
intrusions that appear to have originated from within [the People‟s Republic
of China]”, and “although most intrusions focus on exfiltrating data, the skills

being demonstrated would also apply to wartime computer network
9
attacks”.
Organisationally, the PLA has consolidated the computer and network attack
missions together with Electronic Warfare into an „Integrated Network
th
Electronic Warfare‟ (INEW) activity under the General Staff Department‟s 4
(Electronic Countermeasures) Department. Computer network defence has
rd
apparently been included with cyber-espionage in the 3
(Signals
Intelligence) Department. Specialised IW militia units also share some
10
aspects of these missions.
In addition, the Chinese military and intelligence agencies are able to readily
utilise the corporate sector, including not only state-owned
telecommunications carriers such as China Telecom Corporation but also
so-called „private‟ companies which provide telecommunications and
information technologies and services. For example, Huawei Technologies
Company, one of the biggest suppliers of telecom equipment in the world,
has been effectively blocked from business in the United States because of
11
accusations by US officials that it is “linked to the Chinese military”.
Chinese manufacturers of electronic gadgets, such as iPods, digital picture
frames, and navigation gear, have also been found to have installed viruses
12
in their products that subsequently send information back to Beijing.
And
the Chinese authorities have access to the large community of patriotic
„Netizens‟ which is highly skilled in the design and implantation of Trojan
Horse programs and other forms of malicious software („malware‟). (Table 1
is a selected list of some of the worst viruses and worms propagated from
1994 to 2011.)

Cyber-warfare Activities
PLA IW units have reportedly developed „detailed procedures‟ for Internet
warfare, including software for network scanning, obtaining passwords and
breaking codes, and stealing data; information-paralysing software,
information-blocking software, information-deception software, and other
malware; and software for effecting counter-measures. These procedures
have been tested in field exercises since about 2000. For example, 500
soldiers took part in a network-warfare exercise in Hubei province in 2000 in
which simulated cyber-attacks were conducted against Taiwan, India, Japan
and South Korea. In another exercise in Xian, ten cyber-warfare missions
were rehearsed, including planting (dis)information mines; conducting
information reconnaissance; changing network data; releasing information
bombs; dumping information garbage; releasing clone information;
13
organising information defence; and establishing „network spy stations‟. In
Datong, forty PLA specialists were reported in 2001 to be “preparing
methods of seizing control of communications networks of Taiwan, India,
14
Japan and South Korea”. In October 2000, an exercise presided over by
the PLA Chief of Staff simulated cyber-warfare and EW “with countries south
15
and west of [the] Gobi desert”. As the US Secretary of Defense reported to
Congress in May 2007, “the PLA sees CNO [computer network operations]
as critical to achieving „electromagnetic dominance‟ early in a conflict”. It
has incorporated “offensive CNO into its exercises, primarily in first strikes
16
against enemy networks”.
The PLA has reportedly established at least twelve facilities for INEW
training at unit levels in computer network attack and defence operations,
jamming and other forms of electronic warfare, and other IW activities. The
„flagship‟ facility is evidently located at Zhurihe in the Beijing Military Region,
and features an “informationalised Blue Force” for „opposed force‟ exercises.
During an exercise in the Beijing Military Region in June 2004, for example,
the „Blue Force‟ used network attacks to seize control of the „Red Force‟
command network “within minutes of the start of the exercise, consistent with
the INEW strategy‟s emphasis on attacking enemy C2 [command and
17
control] information systems at the start of combat”. An „opposed force‟ IW
exercise in the Lanzhou Military Region in February 2009 also included
18
computer network attack and defence scenarios.

China and Cyber Warfare

Cyber-warfare activities go beyond intelligence collection operations in at
least two quite different respects. First, they include a large group of
activities designed to damage or destroy network elements, such as Websites, hard drives, operating systems and servers, as well as infrastructure
dependent upon those elements, such as communications systems, financial
services, power grids, air traffic control systems, etc. The simplest of these
activities involve Denial-of-Service attacks which overwhelm network devices
(especially servers and routers), of which there have been innumerable
instances targeting Web-sites in the United States, Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan.
Viruses have been produced that only attack Japanese-language operating
systems. For example, the Win32/KillDPT „intelligent‟ virus, after reading the
registry keys and judging the type of operating system and determining that
it uses Japanese language, will destroy the hard disc by filling it with
garbage data and then restarting the system, completely paralysing the
computer. Another virus which only attacked Japanese operating systems,
W32.Welchia.B, was launched in 2008 and was called the „patriotic virus‟ or
19
the „anti-Japan virus‟.
Second, cyber-warfare activities place a premium on „sleeper‟ Trojan Horses
which are installed during peacetime and which, when activated, can either
damage or destroy systems, or begin to exfiltrate confidential information
back to Beijing. For example, a worm called Worm.Downad.E (an advanced
variant of the Conficker worm), released on 1 April 2009, and which infects
Microsoft operating systems, can remain dormant in the system until a
specially crafted RPC (Remote Procedure Call) request is received; its
20
creators can then take control of the compromised computers.
It was
reported in April 2009 that “hackers believed to be backed by the Chinese
communist regime” had infiltrated computers critical to the functioning of the
US electric power grid and deposited software that would allow them to
21
“catastrophically disrupt service” when ordered.
On 17 November 2008, the US Department of Defense (DoD) banned USB
storage devices across the whole US military. The ban on portable digital
media was imposed throughout the Defense Department‟s Global

Information Grid, which includes more than 17,000 local- and regional-area
networks and approximately seven million individual computers, and covered
“memory sticks, thumb drives and camera flash memory cards”. The ban
followed reports that a worm virus known as „Agent.btz‟ had been found to
have infected some DoD networks. „Agent.btz‟, which was believed to have
originated in China, was described as:
a variation of an older worm that copies itself to removable USB drives from
infected computers and then spreads itself to whatever new systems it is
connected to through USB ports.22

Indian computer systems and networks have also been hit by Chinese
attackers. For example, India‟s INSAT 4B communications satellite suffered
a malfunction in July 2010. It used Siemens software that was the targeted
by a Stuxnet worm that apparently entered the satellite through its control
system software. It has been speculated that Chinese hackers disabled the
Indian satellite for commercial advantage, in an exercise of „higher
23
statecraft‟.
On 10 June 2010, South Korea claimed that a government Web-site was
attacked the previous day from Internet addresses in China. The intrusions
involved a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, and were launched from 120
IP addresses. The targeted Web-site reportedly provided “information on
administrative services and government policies”. The attacks were similar
to those made against the Web-sites of the Office of the Presidency and the
24
Ministry of Defence in Seoul in July 2009.
On 4 March 2011, South Korea‟s National Cyber Security Center said that

attacked the previous day, including those of “the presidential office, the
Foreign Ministry, the National Intelligence Service, U.S. Forces Korea, and
financial institutions”, and that these attacks originated in China. The attacks
involved a more sophisticated form of Denial-of-Service operation, in which
two peer-to-peer file-sharing Web-sites were initially infected with malware,
from which up to 11,000 PCs were then taken over and used in the DOS
25
attack.
Taiwan has been subjected to regular attacks on government Web-sites
since the late 1990s, although these can mainly be attributed to private
Netizens. However, some have undoubtedly been generated by Chinese
government agencies, particularly those involving attacks on the Web-sites
and networks of Taiwan‟s Ministry of National Defense (MND) and
intelligence organisations. In July 2004, Chinese hackers attacked Websites of the MND in an attempt to disrupt its annual Han Kuang-20 (Han
26
Glory-20) defence exercise.
In July 2006, the Ministry included its “firstever anti-hacker drill” in its Han Kuang-22 exercise as “a way of raising
awareness of the dangers of „careless leaks‟ of classified information via the
27
Internet”.
The Web-site of Taiwan‟s National Security Bureau (NSB) was
reportedly attacked from China about 590,000 times from January to
28
October 2010, or an average of about 2000 times a day.
The Taiwanese media have reported that some Chinese hackers utilise
Taiwan to practice their skills. Others route their attacks through Taiwanese
servers, mainly because of the common language. For example, six Internet
29
addresses in Taiwan were used in attacks on Google in January 2010.

With respect to the United States, a computer security company,
Solutionary, reported in March 2009 that it had detected 128 “acts of
cyberagression” per minute coming from Internet addresses in China. The
30
Department of Defense was the main target of the attacks.
The US Air
Force estimated in 2007 that China had “successfully exfiltrated at least 10
31
to 20 terabytes” of sensitive data from US Government computers.
The
amount obtained from US defence industry networks would be much greater.
A State Department cable in 2008 revealed that:
since 2002, cyber intruders involved in what is referred to as the Byzantine
Candor (BC) attack, believed to originate from China, have exploited the
vulnerabilities of Windows to steal log-in credentials and gain access to
hundreds of US government and cleared defence contractor systems over
the years.

It stated that:
In the US, the majority of the systems BC actors have targeted belong to the
US Army, but targets also include other Department of Defense services as
well as Department of State, Department of Energy, additional US
government entities, and commercial systems and networks.32

US officials involved in talks with China at the Copenhagen climate change
summit in 2009 were “subject to a cyber attack containing the „poison ivy‟
remote access tool intended to give hackers almost complete control over
the victim‟s system”. According to a State Department cable:
The message had the subject line „China and Climate Change‟ and was
spoofed to appear as if it were from a legitimate international economics
columnist at the National Journal.33

In November 2010, a US Congressional advisory group reported that a
Chinese state-owned telecommunications company had hijacked US
Internet traffic. The incident occurred on 8 April 2010 and lasted for 18
minutes, during which time traffic was re-routed by China Telecom from
major US Government and military Web-sites (including those of the US
Senate and the Office of the Secretary of Defense) to China, where Chinese

officials were able to monitor the traffic. The re-routed traffic amounted to
34
about 15 percent of global Internet traffic.
In November 2007, the Director-General of MI5 in Britain took the
“unprecedented step” of openly accusing China of carrying out “statesponsored espionage against vital parts of Britain‟s economy, including the
computer systems of big banks and financial services firms”. In a
confidential letter to 300 chief executives and security chiefs at banks,
accountants and legal firms, he warned them that they were under attack
from “Chinese state organisations”, and that “British companies doing
business in China are being targeted by the Chinese Army, which is using
the Internet to steal confidential commercial information”, and provided “a list
of known „signatures‟ that can be used to identify Chinese Trojans and a list
35
of Internet addresses known to have been used to launch attacks”.
With respect to Australia, it was reported in September 2007 that China had
“allegedly tried to hack into highly classified government computer networks
in Australia … as part of a broader international operation to glean military
36
secrets from Western nations”.
According to media reports in February
2008, Chinese „cyber espionage‟ activities have been conducted against
“key Australian Government agencies”, “Chinese computer hackers have
launched targeted attacks on classified Australian Government computer
networks”, and China was “believed to be seeking information on subjects
such as military secrets and the prices Australian companies will seek for
resources such as coal and iron ore”. The Chinese activities reportedly
37
prompted an official review of IT security. In March 2011, it was reported
that the “parliamentary computers” of a least ten Federal Ministers had been
hacked into by Chinese intelligence agencies in February, including those of
Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd and Defence
Minister Stephen Smith, and that “several thousand emails may have been
38
accessed”.

It was reported in February 2007 that Chinese hackers had also attempted to
penetrate “highly classified government computer networks” in New Zealand,
although Prime Minister Helen Clark said that she had been assured by New
Zealand‟s intelligence agencies that “no classified information” had been
39
taken.
In February 2011, Canadian media reported that “Chinese government
hackers” had penetrated the computers of the Finance and Defense
Departments and the Treasury Board in Canada in January. They reportedly
“also infiltrated computers in the offices of senior government officials in a
bid to steal passwords providing access to key government data”. A
Chinese government spokesman denied involvement by Beijing in the
attacks, and stated that “the allegation that the Chinese government
40
supports Internet hacking is groundless”.
With respect to Germany, China‟s intelligence services were accused in
August 2007 of hacking into Chancellor Angela Merkel‟s office and three
other German government ministries. Germany‟s domestic intelligence
service, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, reportedly
discovered the hacking operation in May, and “German security officials
managed to stop the theft of 160 gigabytes of data which were in the
process of being siphoned off German government computers”. The
German press reports said that Trojan Horse programs had been “concealed
in Microsoft Word documents and PowerPoint files which infected IT
installations when opened”, that “information was taken from German
computers in this way on a daily basis by hackers based in the north-western
province of Lanzhou, Canton province and Beijing”, and that “German
officials believe the hackers were being directed by the People‟s Liberation
41
Army”.
In the case of France, the chief of the Network Security Agency stated in
March 2011 that a cyber attack occurred in France in November-December
2010 in which around 150 computers in the Finance Ministry were
penetrated and documents relating to the G-20 were accessed by sources
believed to have originated in China. A further 10,000 computers had to be

taken off-line in March 2011 and “inspected for traces of the Trojan Horse
42
responsible, which was apparently introduced via an email attachment”.
South Korean officials claimed in March 2011 that China targeted Seoul‟s
plans for acquisition of Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles. Chinese
officials flatly denied the claims. Wang Mingzhi, a military strategist at the
People‟s Liberation Army Air Force Command College stated that “South
43
Korea‟s news is groundless”.
Taiwan‟s Ministry of National Defense announced in April 2007 that Chinese
Net Force hackers had used Trojan Horses to obtain information on two
particularly sensitive matters, the Po Sheng („Broad Victory‟) project
(involving cooperation with the United States on C4ISR—command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance)
44
and the Han Kuang-23 („Han Glory-23‟) defence exercise.
In the case of
the Han Kuang-23 material, an officer working on the exercise planning staff
had taken confidential information home in his laptop in order to “do more
work after hours”, but his laptop was penetrated by an unidentified Chinese
hacker and the information stolen. In the case of the Po Sheng data, it had
been copied by another officer onto a USB which was later found to have
45
contained a Trojan Horse designed to send its contents back to Beijing.
In the case of India, officials said in May 2008 that over the previous one and
a half years, China had “mounted almost daily attacks on Indian computer
networks, both government and private”. The officials said that “the Chinese
are constantly scanning and mapping India‟s official networks”, and that “this
gives them a very good idea of not only the content but also of how to
disable the networks or distract them during a conflict”. Attacks that were
“sourced to China” during the first few months of 2008 included “an attack on
the NIC (National Infomatics Centre), which was aimed at the National

Security Council”, and an attack on the Ministry of External Affairs.
In
January 2010, India‟s National Security Advisor, M. K. Narayanan, asserted
that Chinese hackers had attempted to penetrate computers in some of
India‟s most sensitive government officers, including his own, on 15
47
February 2009.
Two reports issued in March 2009 documented “Chinese cyber spying
against Tibetan institutions”. A Canadian investigation revealed a network
which it called „GhostNet‟ which had infected more than 1295 hosts in 103
countries, and included “computers located at ministries of foreign affairs,
embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs”. It found
that Tibetan computers “were conclusively compromised by multiple
infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive
48
information”. Bugged computers were detected “in the foreign ministries of
several countries, including Iran and Indonesia, and in the embassies of
India, South Korea, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan”. Investigators
tracked the virus to “a group of servers on Hainan Island”, and to “other
servers … based in China‟s Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, where
49
intelligence units dealing with Tibetan independence groups are based”.
Chinese hackers have evidently also targeted multinational energy
companies. In February 2011, for example, the computer security firm
McAfee alleged that Chinese attackers had made “coordinated, covert and
targeted” intrusions into the systems of five major oil and gas firms to steal
proprietary information. It reported that “the hackers could be traced back to
China via a server leasing company in Shandong province that hosted the
malware”, as well as to Beijing IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, and that the
attacks, which it called Operation Night Dragon, “focused on financial data
related to oil and gasfield exploration and bidding contracts”. It also claimed
50
that the hackers had “copied proprietary industrial processes”.

China and Cyber Warfare

From mid-2009 to January 2010, a cyber attack originating in China was
launched against Google and more than twenty other companies. According
to a diplomatic cable from the US Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source
reported that the intrusions were directed by the Politburo. The cable
suggested that the hacking was part of a coordinated campaign executed by
“government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws
recruited by the Chinese government”. Called Operation Aurora, a specific
purpose of the attack on Google was reportedly to access the Gmail
accounts of Chinese dissidents and human rights activists. More generally,
the goal was to gain access to and potentially modify source code
repositories at some twenty to thirty-four high tech, security and defence
contractor companies. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the Adobe
PDF format used in Microsoft‟s Internet Explorer browser to open a back
door, through which the intruder performed reconnaissance and gained
51
control over the source codes.
In March 2011, a Denial-of-Service attack originating in China hit the blogpublishing site WordPress, interfering with the company's three data centres
in Chicago, San Antonio and Dallas. The attacks directed “multiple Gigabits
52
per second and tens of millions of packets per second”. And in April, an
on-line petitioning platform, Change.org, which had hosted a petition urging
Chinese authorities to release artist Ai Weiwei from custody, was also hit by
53
a Denial-of-Service attack coming from China.
Chinese intelligence agencies also monitor the computer files and e-mails of
selected individuals. Monitoring the personal e-mails of officials can provide
information that can be used for blackmail or coercion, such as a person‟s
interest in money or sex.

non-governmental cyber-warriors in Asia. It surpassed the United States in
55
Internet users in mid-2008, when it reached an estimated 253 million.
It
reached 457 million by the end of 2010, an increase of 19 percent (or 73
million users) over 2009. Its Internet penetration rate of 34.3 percent is still
relatively low compared to that of developed countries, although it is higher
56
than the world average.
Many of these non-governmental cyber-warriors are motivated by nationalist
causes. Attacks on Taiwanese Web-sites began in 1996, when Chinese
57
hackers defaced and damaged Web-sites during the Presidential election.
In August 1999, there was a spate of cross-Strait attacks against computer
networks and official Web-sites in Taiwan, which were launched by Netizens
reacting to then-President Lee Tung-hui‟s statement in June that relations
between the PRC and Taiwan should be characterised as “special State-toState” relations. These attacks involved more than 160 penetrations into
Taiwanese computer networks. The hackers even invaded the Web-site of
the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial US Embassy (and the
location of the National Security Agency‟s Liaison Office in Taipei), and
58
crashed its server with a bombardment of 45,000 simultaneous e-mails. In
another spate, between November 2001 and July 2002, “hackers based in
China broke into 216 computers at 42 government institutions via a back-up
computer processing unit at Chungwa Telecom”, in what Taiwanese
telecommunications officials said was “the most systematic and large-scale
59
hijacker break-in of its kind in Taiwan”.
In June 2004, Chinese hackers
attacked the site of Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian‟s pro-independence
60
Democratic Progressive Party.
In January 2000, there was an intense spate of attacks on Japanese
government Web-sites, probably triggered by denials by right-wing Japanese
that Japanese troops had massacred Chinese civilians when they seized
Nanjing in 1937. The Web-sites of at least twenty government departments
were attacked, including those of the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) and the
Foreign Ministry. On some sites, the hackers posted slogans criticising

China and Cyber Warfare

Japan‟s war-time acts; important data was erased from one site. Twelve of
the attacks were routed through ISPs (internet service providers) in the PRC,
but some had probably also come through ISPs in South Korea, where there
61
is also widespread resentment at Japan‟s past militarism.
Another round of coordinated assaults on Japanese Web-sites occurred in
early 2005, when Japan‟s Education Ministry approved new textbooks that
critics argued „whitewashed‟ the history of Japanese aggression in the
region. Web-sites of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, the National Police
Agency, the Self-Defense Forces and the Defense and Foreign ministries
were repeatedly taken down by Denial-of-Service attacks. The servers for
the Web-site for Tokyo‟s Yasukuni Shrine were clogged by millions of „ping‟
62
strikes. And in September 2010, when tensions between China and Japan
increased amid the territorial dispute over the Senkaku (or Diaoyu) Islands in
the East China Sea, the Web-sites of both the Defense Ministry and the
National Police Agency were bombarded in Denial-of-Service attacks by
63
Chinese hackers.
During the NATO air war against Yugoslavia in March-June 1999, Chinese
hackers attacked hundreds of government and military Web-sites and other
information systems in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other
NATO countries. „Ping‟ attacks were launched to crash NATO Web servers.
The attacks became especially virulent following the US bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on 7 May. In the United States, computer
systems at the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department were
attacked. More than 100 government Web-sites in the United States
received virus-infected e-mails. Hackers also penetrated the Web-site of the
64
US Embassy in Beijing.
In May 2001, in the aftermath of the EP-3E
incident (and the second anniversary of the US bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade), Chinese hackers attacked “a few hundred” US Web65
sites.
The official White House home page suffered a Denial-of-Service
66
attack for more than two hours on 4 May.

In September 2002, it was reported that since late April Chinese hackers had
been trying to penetrate the Dalai Lama‟s computer network. The manager
of the Tibetan Computer Resource Centre in Dharamsala, in India, said that
“Chinese hackers had designed a virus to plug into the network and steal
67
information”.
The attacks came in hundreds of e-mails using false
addresses appearing to be friendly sources, and included Trojan Horse
programs designed to seek out files and attempt to e-mail them to an
address in China, and programs designed to open „back doors‟ to allow the
hackers to take control of target computers through Internet connections.
According to dissident groups, who were sometimes able to trace the source
of the attacks, the hacking was officially sponsored: “They are Chinese
hackers employed by a State-owned industry operating on the State‟s
68
time”.
There is no doubt that the Chinese authorities exercise some degree of
control over some of these hackers. In May 2002, for example, when the US
Department of Defense reportedly braced itself for an onslaught of cyber
attacks, they never materialised because (according to the Deputy
Commander of the Pentagon‟s Joint Task Force on Computer Network
69
Operations), “actually the government of China asked them not to do that”.
It was reported in November 2008 that the largest US military base in
Afghanistan, at Bagram, was hit by a computer virus that affected nearly
three-quarters of the computers on the base. This was not the first such
cyber-attack. Officials stated that “earlier incarnations of the virus had
exported information such as convoy and troop movements”. It could not be
determined “whether the viruses were part of a covert Chinese government
effort or the work of private hackers”, although US military spokesmen did
say that the Chinese “learn a lot from these attacks, like how our logistics
70
and other systems work”.
In a secret cable in June 2009, the US State Department noted that Chinese
authorities were working with private companies that were known to have
recruited infamous hackers. It stated that “there is a strong possibility the
PRC is harvesting the talents of its private sector in order to bolster offensive
and defensive computer network operations capabilities”, warned that the
“potential linkages of China‟s top companies with the PRC illustrate the
government‟s use of its private sector in support of information warfare

objectives”, and gave two examples of hacker recruitment. One was Lin
Yong (also known as „LION‟), who founded the Honkers Union of China
(HUC) which attacked US and Japanese networks around 2001, and the
71
other was the XFocus group which produced the Blaster worm in 2003.
In July 2008, CNN reporters met with members of a hacking group that
operated from an apartment on the island of Zhoushan, just south of
Shanghai, and who claimed that they had “hacked into the Pentagon and
downloaded information”. They also claimed that they had been “paid by the
72
Chinese government”.
Pentagon officials told a Congressional hearing in Washington in March
2008 that computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and
France had been hit by “multiple intrusions” originating from China during
2007, but were generally cautious about attributing these to the Chinese
military or government authorities as opposed to private Netizens. However,
David Sedney, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia,
testified that: “The way these intrusions are conducted are certainly
consistent with what you would need if you were going to actually carry out
73
cyber warfare”.
On the other hand, several factors militate against the PLA‟s incorporation of
Netizen or „hacktivist‟ activities in its plans for computer network operations
in war-time. Guiding and directing these activities would be very difficult.
Hacktivist activities have the potential to interfere with and “inadvertently
disrupt” the PLA‟s own attacks. They also:
risk shutting down the lines of communication in use for intelligence
collection or accidentally overwhelm channels the PLA is using as feedback
loops to monitor the effectiveness of [its] network attacks.74

China’s Vulnerabilities
Chinese officials have pointed out that “China is the biggest victim country
75
of hacking”. Official data showed that “more than one million IP addresses
were under control by overseas sources”, and that more than 42,000 Web76
sites were “tampered by hackers” in 2009.

Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Coordination Centre in
Beijing in a report released in March 2011, more than 4600 Chinese
government Web-sites had their content modified by hackers in 2010, an
77
increase of 68 percent over the previous year.
A two-month survey conducted in mid-2003 by officials of the Ministry of
Public Security showed that 85 percent of computers in China were infected
with a computer virus. The officials noted that “the main reason for the
78
spread of the viruses was increasing use of the internet and e-mail”. The
proportion increased to 88 percent in 2004, but then dropped to about 80
79
percent in 2005.
A Chinese Internet security company reported in July
2007 that more than 35 million computers in China had been attacked by
viruses in the first half of that year. It estimated that 68.71 percent of the
viruses were Trojan Horses, of which 76.04 percent were “phishing-related
80
viruses”. A study covering January-November 2008 found that the number
infected had increased by 12.16 percent compared to the previous year, and
that 64 percent were Trojans, 20 percent back door viruses, 12 percent other
viruses and four percent worms. The majority were being used by hackers
81
to steal virtual property.
A list of the top 100 viruses infecting computers world-wide at the beginning
of 2011 showed that in every single case China was the country “most
82
affected”. Moreover, nearly all these viruses originated in China. The top
10 in 2008 all originated in China: Trojan.PSW.Win32.GameOL, which
opens up firewalls and collects confidential information such as personal
financial information; Trojan.Win32.Undef, similar to PSW.Win32.GameOL;
RootKit.Win32.Mnless, which obtains root privileges and uses them to

RootKit.Win32.Undef, which is similar to RootKit.Win32.Mnless;
Trojan.PSW.Win32.XYOnline, which is similar to the first two viruses;
Trojan.Clicker.Win32.Pophot, also similar; Worm.Win32.Agent, released on

Trojan.PSW.Win32.QQPass, released on 24 September 2006, which also
affects the Windows PE EXE file and which is designed to steal user

According to Chinese sources, China has over thirty active Internet virus
groups. Ten virus-producing groups account for 80 percent of viruses in the
country: these are known as the Huangfei Hu, HYC, HY, Old Serpent, 192,
84
GZWZ, CL, Zhang Feng, WG, and Anne Groups. These virus groups differ
from hackers in that they do not directly steal money. Rather, they use a
variety of techniques to re-direct computer users to selected Web-sites,
including “tampering with pop-up advertisements, creating website links on
people‟s desktops, changing the computer‟s homepage or changing icons on
the bookmarks bar”. A Chinese cyber security expert has noted that:
it is extremely difficult to destroy these groups. The virus group Huangfeihu,
for example, changed its IP address over 500 times within one year and is
vigilant to the extreme. But what‟s even more key in the situation is that
many of these groups set up their servers abroad, hence making them
impossible to trace.85

The Chinese regime has attempted to impose greater control over internal
networks, both to suppress domestic opposition and to block penetration
from outside the country. It has surrounded the country with a Great
Firewall, also referred as the Golden Shield Project, which is an Internet
censorship and surveillance project operated by the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS). It was initiated in 1998, following approval by the State
Council of the „Computer Information Network and Internet Security,
Protection, and Management Regulations‟ on 11 December 1997, when
Internet usage was becoming popular in China, and took operational effect in
November 2003. It is estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 Internet
86
police are employed in this project. New laws were enacted in April 2010
which require Internet and mobile phone operators “to inform the authorities

of any illegal information being transmitted on their systems”, i.e., any
87
information that might affect political stability.
Since the beginning of the 2000s, Beijing has been pushing both
government agencies and the business sector to use Unix and Linux
operating systems. More recently, it has mandated the use of Kylin, a highly
secure, Unix-based operating system, apparently much more secure than
Microsoft server software, which China‟s University of Science and
Technology for National Defence developed, and installation of which began
on government and military systems in 2009, with the intention of making
88
Beijing‟s networks “impenetrable to U.S. military and intelligence agencies”.
It is clear that there are at least as many Netizens concerned with breaching
the Great Firewall (a practice known as fanqiang, or „scaling the wall‟) as
89
there are with attacking foreign networks.
Several techniques are used
which evade blocking by using third party sites that are not filtered, including
VPN (virtual private network) services, such as GPass or Hotspot Shield;
blocking-resistant tools, such as Freegate or Ultrasurf; secure shell (SSH)
access tools; proxy servers; and anonymity software such as Tor, which is
90
also an effective circumvention tool.
James Lewis, the cyber-warfare expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., has argued that Beijing‟s
need to secure China‟s computers and networks against internal dissent and
opposition actually comprises an „asymmetric handicap‟. He has pointed out
that: “For all the effort the Chinese put into cyber competition, external
efforts”—against a potential foe like the United States—“are second priority.
The primary priority is domestic control and regime survival. The external
91
part is a side benefit”.

China and Cyber Warfare

Conclusions
Chinese strategists are quite aware of their own deficiencies and
vulnerabilities with respect to cyber-warfare. In June 2000, “a series of hightechnology combat exercises” being conducted by the PLA “had to be
92
suspended” when they were attacked by “a computer hacker”.
China‟s
telecommunications technicians were impotent against the intermittent
hijacking of the Sinosat-1 national communications satellite by Falun Gong
„practitioners‟ in the early 2000s. China‟s demonstrated offensive cyberwarfare capabilities are fairly rudimentary. Chinese hackers have been able
to easily orchestrate sufficient simultaneous „pings‟ to crash selected Web
servers (i.e., Denial-of-Service attacks). They have been able to penetrate
Web-sites and deface them, erase data from them, and post different
information on them (such as propaganda slogans). And they have
developed various fairly simple viruses for spreading by e-mails to disable
targeted computer systems, as well as Trojan Horse programs insertible by
e-mails to steal information from them. However, they have evinced little
proficiency with more sophisticated hacking techniques. The viruses and
Trojan Horses they have used have been fairly easy to detect and remove
before any damage has been done or data stolen. There is no evidence that
China‟s cyber-warriors can penetrate highly secure networks or covertly
steal or falsify critical data. They would be unable to systematically cripple
selected command and control, air defence and intelligence networks and
databases of advanced adversaries, or to conduct deception operations by
secretly manipulating the data in these networks. The gap between the
sophistication of the anti-virus and network security programs available to
China‟s cyber-warriors as compared to those of their counterparts in the
more open, advanced IT societies, is immense. China‟s cyber-warfare
authorities must despair at the breadth and depth of modern digital
information and communications systems and technical expertise available
to their adversaries.
China is condemned to inferiority in IW capabilities for probably several
decades. At best, it can employ asymmetric strategies designed to exploit
the (perhaps relatively greater) dependence on IT by their potential
3
adversaries—both the C ISREW elements of adversary military forces and
the vital telecommunications and computer systems in the adversary's
homelands. In particular, attacks on US information systems relating to
military command and control, transportation and logistics could “possibly
degrade or delay U.S. force mobilisation in a time-dependent scenario”, such
93
as US intervention in a military conflict in the Taiwan Straits.
China‟s
cyber-warfare capabilities are very destructive, but could not compete in

extended scenarios of sophisticated IW operations. In other words, they
function best when used pre-emptively, as the PLA now practices in its
94
exercises.
In sum, the extensive Chinese IW capabilities, and the
possibilities for asymmetric strategies, are only potent if employed first.
