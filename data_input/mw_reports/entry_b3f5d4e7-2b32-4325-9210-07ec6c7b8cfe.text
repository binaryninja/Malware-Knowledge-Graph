Nmap Script to scan for Winnti infections

TKCERT

This Nmap script can be used to scan hosts for Winnti infections. It uses parts of Winnti's
protocol as seen in the wild in 2016/2017 to check for infection and gather additional
information.

Winnti
Winnti is a malware that is used by some APT groups.
It has been used since at least 2013 and has evolved over time. You can find some
information here

SecOps Warning
WINNTI ONLY SUPPORTS ONE CONNECTION AT A TIME. IF YOU SCAN A HOST FOR
WINNTI YOU WILL RESET THE CURRENT CONNECTION IF THERE IS ONE.

Requirements
This script needs liblua 5.3 to work. You may want to download the latest Nmap version to
get support out of the box (confirmed working with Nmap 7.25BETA2 and 7.60).

winnti-detect
Categories: malware safe
https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/winnti-detect.html
The winnti-detect script checks if the host is backdoored by winnti rootkit. It
sends a winnti command to the first three open TCP ports and checks the
response. When the connection to one of these ports fails, the next port is
chosen until three successful tries are completed. When a winnti infection is
found the script gathers basic host information by sending a query to the
backdoor and printing the response. Version 1.0, 2016-09-26
*** SECOPS-WARNING ***
Winnti only supports one connection at a time. If you scan a host for winnti
you will reset the current connection if there is one.
*** IMPORTANT ***
Winnti installations may use different encryption keys. The default value
included in this script is 0xABC18CBA (taken from a real sample).
You can set a custom key with --script-args key=0x........
The key must be given in big-endian.
