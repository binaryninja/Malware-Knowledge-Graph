Preface
The below report provides an in-depth review reviews significant trends, as well as major attack events in the cyber
landscape that took place on the first half of 2019. The report follows our Cyber Events Summary Report of 2018 and
presents changes and developments in the political and economic scenes as well, as these has had a crucial impact on the
cyber arena.
In recent months we have observed multiple targeted ransomware attacks against major companies, including
international corporations – undoubtfully, this is the most significant attack vector of the first half of 2019. The main
penetration vector in these attacks includes the use of decoy email carrying malicious content and RDP (Remote Desktop
Protocol) attack. In our assessment, this year RDP has become a significant vector through which computer systems are
infected worldwide.
The most notable example of targeted ransomware operation is the Norsk Hydro Attack which we classified as the most
significant attack of the first half of 2019. Forensic investigations covering the attack on Norsk Hydro, as well as other
companies who suffered from similar incidents, revealed an extensive attack infrastructure aided by sophisticated, evasive
tools and designated zero-day vulnerabilities. And indeed, the LockerGoga ransomware infrastructure has managed to
infiltrate hundreds of companies worldwide and extort tens of millions of USD. Norsk Hydro alone stated that the damage
caused by the attack is estimated at around 75 million USD.

Significant increase of targeted ransomware attacks on large companies and organizations globally
Behind several of these attacks are nation-state actors that execute ransomware attacks with the end goal of causing harm
rather than financial gain. Several of the most notable ransomware attacks so far are – Norsk Hydro, ASCO, SonAngol and
Verint. In contrast to the rising popularity of targeted ransomware, destructive ransomware attacks – in which the files are
corrupted without a recovery option – were not reported during the first half of 2019. This could be the result of intense
hindering collaborations between agencies worldwide.

Increase of BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks
This type of an attack, in which the attacker traditionally impersonates an executive in the company or a third-party
provider, is the most common type of attack globally. According to the latest data from the FBI, as of June 2018, BEC scams
have compromised over 12 Billion dollars globally.1 This figure is expected to continue rising in 2019. On the past two
months, attackers begun leveraging AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems to impersonate senior employees' voices and
execute financial transactions, resulting in immediate losses of millions of euros.

More Attacks against financial institutions
In 2019, financial institutes and banking users are still a desirable target for tailored cyber-attacks aimed at financial
revenue. However, while the trend continues, we did not see a sharp increase in the attack rate. This appears to be a direct
result of the considerable effort and resources invested by the banks in mitigating cyber threat conjunction with attackers
targeting more profitable and less secure targets such as crypto-currency platforms. In 2019 these platforms continue
suffering hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, being the most targeted financial platform to date. Alongside that, a

notable decrease in the rate of attacks targeting SWIFT system was observed – most likely as a result of the great effort
invested by the security industry into protecting these systems.

Social media platforms combat the fake news phenomena
We have seen over the last six months considerble efforts by social media platforms to identify and take down fake-news
sources and actors, by conducting both vast investigative efforts and routine take down actions, little by little. While this
actions don't fully neutralize the phenomena, they do play a crucial role in raising awareness.

Attack attempts against Internet of Things (IoT) systems and SCADA Systems
Over the last six months we have seen alarming rise of threats to industrial IoT (Internet of Things) or ICS systems. Of note,
various threat actors targeting power-grids. The most prominent actors in this regard are the USA and Russia. For example,
Triton malware which was used in the attack on the Saudi oil refineries is currently being attributed to Russia

Escalation of the Digital Cold War between the US, Russia and China
The recent developments of a "digital cold war" between the US, China and Russia - amongst others - were a key event on
the global cyber arena during the first half of 2019. Political conflicts resulted in immediate actions in the cyber landscape
and led to parallel efforts by many power countries to possess designated SCADA malware, as well as the ability to cripple
their adversaries' power facilities in preparation for a time of need. For the first time, Trump administration employees
reported that a payload developed in the US was planted in Russia's power network .
One of the most outstanding results of this state his can be seen in the continued weaponization of social media platforms
to propagate disinformation on a massive scale, and rapid proliferation of advanced malware. The latter in particular has
facilitated new threats against service providers, alongside critical infrastructure.
Accordingly, these nations and their allies have begun taking major mitigation actions; be them economic such as
embargoes and global trade restrictions, or technological such as new plans to implement an "internet kill-switch".2 These
and other developments are largely reactionary backlash following large-scale campaigns on numerous industries and
sectors, including critical infrastructure, large industrial operations, and military organizations.

More and more countries are claiming almost direct responsibility for major attacks
This is likely in an attempt to create deterrence and signals the next stage in the digital cold war – "who is a bigger
threat/can cause the most amount of damage". Alongside the deterrence efforts we continue to see exposures of Critical
zero-day vulnerabilities that pose a threat to global computer networks, such as the BlueKeep flaw. We believe that Russia
will likely attempt exploiting these vulnerbilities to execute a massive cyber attack in the vain of NotPetya.

Increase in Iranian cyber capabilities alongside the expansion of their cyber operations against foreign
countries
With this regard, we also saw Iran expanding their operation into new regions. The increase in Iranian offensive operations
in the cyber arena is aligned with the escalation of the conflict between Iran and the United States, concerning the Nuclear
deal violation, the US sanctions and more.

The Most Prominent Attack of 2019 – Norsk Hydro Corporation
and Other Companies Attacked by the LockerGoga Ransomware
On March 18, 2019, Norsk Hydro, one of the largest aluminum manufacturers in the world based in Norway, experienced a
significant cyber-attack using a ransomware called LockerGoga. The attack took place in the firm's factories in the US and
led to a shutdown of all their computer systems. It also partially damaged the manufacturing systems in additional
locations around the world. As a result, some factories had to switch to manual operation, slowing the manufacturing
process and resulting in significant financial losses.
This is the first LockerGoga ransomware attack to gain global public attention. Recent findings indicate that the over 1,200
companies were attacked by the ransomware to this point, most of them global corporations with multiple R&D and
manufacturing centers. Prior to these attacks, the known use of LockerGoga took place on January 24, 2019, against the
France-based engineering firm Altran.3
It should be noted that while the ransomware has successfully infected multiple targets, it was not always activated.
Nevertheless, infected companies may still be in danger as the attackers have gain access to their networks, and could
leverage it for additional malware infection or offer it for sale to the highest bidder on underground forums. The damages
could me immense. The companies whose files were encrypted by Locker Goga suffered direct losses tens of millions of
USD and additional indirect losses. In the case of Norsk Hydro, for example, the estimated damage caused by the attack as
of the end of July is 75 million USD.

Attack Vector
According to the Norwegian Cert, "NorCert", the Norsk Hydro ransomware infection was probably conducted manually,
after the attackers gained access and achieved persistency on the company network – an operation which probably took
several months to complete. On March 19, probably several minutes after midnight, the encryption process of multiple
computers and servers had begun.
As a result, some 9,000 machines were encrypted and ceased to function. The initial intrusion vector appears to have
included a large number of actions including Brute Force attacks on the company's RDP servers, SQL Injection attacks on
company sites, exploiting a number of zero-day vulnerabilities and privilege escalation on sensitive systems, obtained
through sophisticated phishing attacks. Part of the attack included logging out of vital control systems and locking
employees' accounts. Consequently, the IT staff was unable to mitigate the event. The firm probably physically

disconnected part of the network in an attempt to slow down the attack, which made it more difficult to realize the full
extent of the damage.
According to analysis by Nozomi Network Labs4 the ransomware is capable of encrypting the following type of files: DLL,
ppt, pot, pps, pptx, potx, ppsx, sldx and pdf. Similar cyber-attacks using other ransomware families, such as Ryuk and
MegaCortex, had also been observed.

Cloud Email Services enabled Functional Survivability
The firm's email services remained protected throughout the attack because the Norsk Hydro email system is based on
Microsoft 365, a cloud service. Consequently, they were able to continue basic operations and maintain contact with
clients. The employees logged in to their email accounts via personal smartphones and tablets, so some work flow was
maintained, and recent orders could be retrieved from the clients. The manufacturing systems were disconnected from
the computers and were operated manually.

The Attackers
As of early mid-July 2019, the common estimation is that a well-funded Russian threat group is responsible for the attack.
An initial analysis released by Kaspersky5 states that some parts of the ransomware file can be affiliated to Russian
cybercrime group called GrimSpider. The investigation is still in process, however based on the attack stages – which
included preliminary network research, zero-day vulnerability exploit and neutralization of security systems – there is no
doubt this was a targeted attack.
According to an estimation of a research team for the Dutch government, at least two threat groups collaboration together
are behind the attack. Their findings offer three possible motives for the attack. The first motive is financial, because after
the attack victims were prompted to pay the ransom demand, and were threatened to have the access obtained by the
attackers sold to other attackers. Another assessment suggests an espionage motive, relying on the fact that some of the
attacks contained internal information. The third assessment is that this campaign was carried out for the purpose of
destroying and damaging critical infrastructure. It is important to note that currently there are no definite findings
supporting this, but at this stage it cannot be ruled out.
Several days after the attack on Norsk Hydro was reported, American chemicals companies Hexion and Momentive
revealed that they too fell victim to a LockerGoga ransomware attack. The two companies, who are controlled by the same
investment fund "Apollo Global Management"6 both suffered an attack on March 12; six days before the attack on Norsk
Hydro.

Cyber Attacks On The Global Finacial Sector
Central Bank of Malta Breached - likely a SWIFT Attack; Loss of 13 Million Euro
On February 13, 2019, the central bank of Malta (BOV), which also operates as a commercial bank for half of Malta's
population, identified that it fell victim to a cyber attack, which resulted in a loss of €13 million.7 Note that the attack was
detected by anti-fraud systems, and not by the security systems. Immediately after detecting the theft, the bank decided
to shut down all of its systems: ATMS, credit card payment terminals, business owners' equipment, email and telephone
services, their website, even shutting down all of their branches in Malta. The shut-down was in effect until the attack was
neutralized and the affected systems were recovered.
The exact date during which the attack was executed is unclear as of early March. Nevertheless, it should be noted that
since the bank did not report that it was able to retrieve the stolen funds, the attack was most likely carried out at least
three days prior to the reveal (On February 10th, when the bank is closed). During the attack, 11 transactions were carried
out, most likely via the SWIFT system, to accounts in the US, UK, Czech Republic and Hong Kong. The sum of the
transactions amounted to 13 million euros. Also, worth mentioning is that the finds were transferred to Western countries.
This is interesting as usually attackers try to transfer money to countries with less adequate monitoring systems.
The indirect damage included total shutdown of the bank's services for over 24 hours – a situation which hurt all its clients
and credit card companies. Also, a significant amount of business owners use the bank's services, and their systems were
shut down as well. The bank stated that its clients were not affected, as their funds and accounts remained unchanged. It
also stated that it is working to "clean" its systems, and to bring back its services back to normal. On February 14th, the
app and website returned to full activity. This attack (the first of its kind in 2019) is reminiscent of Russian and North
Korean attack groups' ongoing attacks on core banking systems. Similar to other cases, these groups choose to attack
banks in countries with inadequate security systems.

Large-Scare Spoofing Campaign Impersonating Major US Banks' IP addresses
A report published in late April revealed a large-scale spoofing campaign targeting US banks. According to the researchers,
this campaign was detected due to heavy internet traffic caused by broad scans of the internet. More interesting however

is that the scans were conducted via spoofed IP addresses of big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America
and SunTrust.8 Currently the reason behind this is unknown, but CyberScoop conjectures that this was executed in order
to disrupt the banks' security teams and cyber security companies' ability in mitigating malicious activity.
The campaign appears to have taken place between April 19, 2019 – April 23, 2019. The spike in traffic-spoofing started on
Friday the 19th and continued until late Tuesday the 23rd.

Analysis of the attack
According to Security researcher Andrew Morris, the volume of traffic is too low to be a DDoS attack. Instead he claims that
it is possible that a malicious actor attempted to fool firewalls and other security products into blocking traffic originating
from the banks, with the purpose of embarrassing security vendors. Further, while Traffic spoofing are common attacks,
they rarely target specific entities, as was in this case. A list of the spoofed IP addresses was uploaded to Pastebin but has
since been removed.9
Initial investigation, conducted by BRICA (Business Risk Intelligence & Cyberthreat Awareness), indicates that the attackers
sent spoofed TCP packets, but made no attempt to complete the three-way-handshake. This was because they only
attempted to flood security vendor with false positive. With that in mind, based on this incident, security vendors could
use this attack in order to better their monitoring and blocking rules for each of their clients. 10
Mitigating such attacks is problematic and complex. If a security service or product blocks internet scans, you should verify
that the blocked IP addresses are the source of the scan. Note however that this is not an option with of SYN() and FIN()
packets. It is possible to create whitelists in order to prevent false positive, however it should be taken in to account that it
is impossible to create a global whitelist.

Chile-based Interbank Network Redbanc Attacked
Redbanc is a Chile-based company responsible for connecting the ATMs of all the banks in Chile. On December 2018, the
company was attacked using the PowerRatankba malware, affiliated with the North Korean APT group Lazarus. Findings
about the malware family were published on January 15 th by Flashpoint.11
The Lazarus APT group is commonly associated with Bureau 121 – the cyber warfare unit of the North Korean regime. The
group gained publicity thanks to its aggressive worldwide campaigns on 2009. It specializes in attacks targeting financial
institutions and services, including banks and cryptocurrency exchange platforms, many of them in South America and
East Asia.
The attack begun when in IT expert at Redbanc was infected by malware after opening on a message that was sent to him
via a social media platform, probably LinkedIn, allegedly containing a job offer. Upon clicking the link to apply for the job,
the IT expert was referred to a decoy job application page. To gain the victim’s trust, a Lazarus representative had a job
interview in Spanish with the expert. A day later the company announced it had been breached.
Apparently, while attempting to apply for the job the victim downloaded a file called ApplicationPDF.exe’ seemingly a
recruiting software. The executable is included in ThreadProc and SendUrl processes, which process parameters encoded
in Base64 and run the malicious code. The downloaded file decoded the parameter code encoded in Base64,
communicated with the server and run the PowerShell code in a hidden window. During the infection process, another PS

script is executed that decrypts a script created by PowerRatankba. The malware serves as a both a downloader and a
spyware, in charge of collecting information to be used in further attacks by Lazarus.

Attack on British Metro Bank Exploiting a Vulnerability in the Two-factor Authentication
System
On February 1st, it was reported that UK’s Metro Bank has fallen victim to a sophisticated attack that bypassed the twofactor authentication (2FA) by exploiting a SS7 vulnerability. The authentication system sends SMS messages with codes
for confirming clients' financial transactions. It appears that the attackers reached clients' devices by remotely tracking
devices and monitoring clients' SMS messages that request confirmation for transactions.
SS7 protocol is used for routing calls and SMS and is used by telecommunication firms worldwide. By exploiting a
vulnerability on the protocol, attackers are able to intercept messages and thus obtain clients' location and personal
information through their cellphones. Metro Bank stated that only a few clients were affected, and no one lost money
from their accounts. Metro Bank is cooperating with the relevant communication providers and the authorities to
investigate the attack. The bank advises its clients to be alert and report any activity which seems suspicious.

European Banking Authority Report on SMS 2FA-Based Financial Transactions
Following the attack the UK National Cyber Security Center stated that exploiting such vulnerabilities is a known method
which has already been used previously. It is a common attack vector used in fraud campaigns and in cellphone espionage
attacks. The website InfoSecurity reviewed a similar attack which took place in May 2017, and assessed that using SMS
messages for 2-Factor authentication is no longer reliable identification method. It is recommended to use authenticator
apps or Time-based One-time Password algorithm (TOTP) for 2-Factor Authentication in order to avoid such attacks12.
Furthermore, in June the European Banking Authority (EBA) recently published an opinion report on the elements of
strong customer authentication systems for financial transactions. Below is an excerpt regarding SMS-based 2FA
authentication.
"As stated in the EBA Opinion on the implementation of the RTS (paragraph 35), a device could be used as evidence of

possession, provided that there is a ‘reliable means to confirm possession through the generation or receipt of a dynamic
validation element on the device’. Evidence could, in this context, be provided through the generation of a one-time
password (OTP), whether generated by a piece of software or by hardware, such as a token, text message (SMS) or push
notification. In the case of an SMS, and as highlighted in Q&A 4039, the possession element ‘would not be the SMS
itself, but rather, typically, the SIM-card associated with the respective mobile number’"
Below are the 2FA alternatives suggested by the EBA (note – most relay on biometric identifiers).

Despite this report, several large banks in Germany have already began implementing stronger 2FA authentication process
for financial transactions, phasing out the less secure SMS-based systems.13 These new measures have been strongly
pushed by European regulators in recent years.
SMS Transaction Authentication Number (aka SMS-TAN, or mTAN) is the most commonly used method by banks to
authenticate financial transactions by issuing temporary passwords via SMS messages.14 Attackers however have been
manipulating this procedure to unlawfully execute transactions from bank customers. Cryptocurrency companies have
also suffered from these attacks, losing tens of millions of dollars in recent months alone.
Accordingly, over the last few years various governing bodies (such as the German BSI - Federal Office for Information
Security) have warned financial institutions and customers from using this technology. The most attack vectors are
phishing or sim swapping.

New verification methods
Below are the new methods employed by German banks to verify transactions:
• ChipTAN – issuing Tokens by the bank to verify transactions.
• PhotoTAN – mobile apps that provide a unique barcode to work in conjunction with the SMS messages.
• PushTAN – verification via an app operating as a Token. For example, Google authenticator and Microsoft
authenticator. It is unclear whether this method meets the European Banking Authority standards.
• Digital Signature – using smart encrypted cards.

65 Million USD From a Bank in Kuwait
In late March, rumors began spreading on Twitter about a 65 million USD theft from a bank in Kuwait via its SWIFT system.
However, as of early July, no official announcement had been published by any bank. Over the course of the last few
weeks we have been tracking the case via social media, bank portals and VirusTotal, in which we used to detect malicious
files uploaded from Kuwait. Related indicators and rumors that the bank in question is the Gulf Bank of Kuwait were
revealed in Twitter. The bank published a statement on March 27 claiming its systems had run into technical difficulties
that damages its international money transfer system (probably the SWIFT system). No cyber-attack was mentioned.

Cyber Attacks On The Fin-Tech and Crypto Firms
Advanced Spy-Malware Campaign Targeting FinTech Companies
On March 19th, Palo Alto's research team Unit42 revealed a new attack campaign against FinTech firms via an espionage
malware (RAT) named Cardinal RAT. The campaign probably occurred over the last two years and was first detected in
January 2019.

Malware Analysis
Cardinal RAT malware family was first identified in 2017 when Unit42 exposed a limited attack campaign (27 known
samples). Since then, the research team continued to monitor the malware and recently identified a new version (1.7.2)
with several changes, including advanced obfuscation functions which hinder detection and analysis.
The main obfuscation technique is based on steganography which obfuscates malicious content inside an embedded
Bitmap (BMP) image file. When the .NET based malware is executed, it extracts a malicious DLL file from the image's pixels.
It then deciphers it with a single-bit XOR encryption key.
Like previous versions, Cardinal RAT has many capabilities:
•

Data collection on the infected system.

•

Changing system settings.

•

Executing commands remotely in the infected system.

•

Downloading and executing files without permissions.

•

Exploiting the infected system as a reverse proxy.

•

Downloading updates to the malware.

•

Retrieving passwords.

•

Keylogging and screenshot capturing.

•

Erasing cookies from browsers.

•

Deleting the malware from the infected system.

Possible link to EVILNUM malware & attack vector
When the researchers examined the samples uploaded to VirusTotal, they identified a possible connection to a malware
family named EVILNUM; a JavaScript based malware that collects information and achieves a foothold in the systems and

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 12 of 52

networks before using Cardinal RAT. Note that this malware was identified in only a small number of firms, similarly to
Cardinal RAT.
In the campaigns of both of the malwares, the infection vector was carried out with a malicious phishing document which
were very similar to one another. This document usually contained lists of names and numbers (the type of numbers was
not mentioned, but possibly telephone numbers) of people who work in the forex and cryptocurrency sector.

Cryptocurrency Attacks 2.0
In late 2017, the cyber security community watched in awe as Crypto Mining malware, most notably web-based scripts,
took the world by storm and climbed to the top of various Global Top malware charts. The frenzy begun with the infamous
case of The Pirate Bay. The Pirate Bay is the world’s largest BitTorrent indexer – it is a massive online source for digital
content including movies, games and software.
Shortly after the first web-based Crypto Miners spurred, it has been discovered that The Pirate Bay had planted a crypto
mining JavaScript that secretly utilizes the website visitors' computer resources to mine the Monero Cryptocurrency while
visiting the portal.15
Website owners nowadays depend on advertising revenue to survive; however the user experience can be highly
interrupted by the appearance of multiple advertisements on the content page. The birth of JavaScript-based crypto
miners offered another solution – instead of burdening the users with flashy ads, a website owner can simply embed a
JavaScript within the website html page which mines a cryptocurrency using the visitor's CPU power and generate a
respectful revenue. While this tactic sounds effective, to separate it from malicious activities carried out on the user
browser unknowingly such as browser hijacking, transparency is required.
It is expected of a website owner to notify its visitors that an alternative process is taking place in order to spare them the
inconvenience of online advertisements. Unfortunately, the simplicity of the use of the script, which only required
embedding, rather than distribution and infection, led to giant wave of hackers that exploited legitimate, high profile
websites to embed a web-based Crypto Miner without the website owner's knowledge.
Unlike website owners, attackers use as much as 90% of the user's CPU power to mine cryptocurrency. Top websites
exploited for mining in the past include a Los Angeles Times website and a Jerusalem Post website, as well as 4,000
government websites in the US, UK and Australia.
The success of web-based crypto miners was boosted by two key trends:
1.

The sharp rise in the value of many cryptocurrencies. The first cryptocurrency that gained popularity and led to a
significant market growth was BitCoin. Its popularity led to the development of many additional digital currencies
such as Ethereum, Monero and Litecoin. Monero is often preferred by attackers due to the relatively lights
resources required to mine it.

2.

The rise in the required resources. As time passed and crypto mining gained popularity, the computational
resources needed to mine new crypto coins grew higher. Specialized hardware, or a mass number of personal
computers combined became a necessity.

After a long period of Crypto Mining malware, especially web-based scripts, dominating the cyber landscape, it seems safe
to say that the golden age of this type of attack is behind us. As 2018 progressed, the prices of BitCoin and along with it

most other coins, fell significantly, rendering the process of mining it unprofitable. As always, cyber criminals found
another way to leverage the cryptocurrency market for monetization, taking the attack to the next level.
Lately, we have been observing a new vector of attack leveraging cryptocoins - Cryptocurrency exchange attacks.
Prominent attack vectors used recently to target Cryptocurrency Exchanges are the following –
1.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, capable of shutting down the entire trading activity of the exchange
for a limited time thus preventing transactions, lowering the value of the coins and damaging the reputation of
the portal. In June 2018, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges suffered a DDoS attack that ceased
the activity of the exchange for three hours.

2.

Phishing attacks – simple yet effective, phishing attacks can be useful in this case as well. Using tailored content,
attackers could lure an employee into granting them access to the exchange network, thus enabling information
and credential theft.

3.

Transaction malleability attacks, in which the attacker alters the transaction ID of a BTC transaction and uses it to
carry out a transaction of his wish. If attackers are able to change a transaction ID without invalidating it, they
could perform a transaction of their own from the sender's wallet. The sender would think that the transaction
has failed, when in fact, it had already taken place before the failure.

4.

Online Wallet attacks – wallets that are connected to the internet are often offered by exchange portals for
secured storage of private keys of cryptocurrencies. while many of them state they use offline resources to store
the keys it is not always the case, making them a tempting target.

Binance Data Breach leads to Theft of 40 million USD
In May 2019, some 40 million USD worth of BitCoins were stolen from one of the most popular coin exchange portals,
Binance. The company admitted that 7,000 BitCoins were stolen from its storage, and that the attackers managed to
bypass two-factor authentication processes. Binance is considered as the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in
terms of trading volume.
Shortly after in June 2019, the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, Bitrue, reported a massive data breach which
led to losses of 4.5 million USD from customer funds. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the company's security
procedures to steal private wallet information and to collect coins from approximately 90 wallets.

32 million USD Stolen in a Breach of the Japanese Exchange BitPoint
Just recently one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange hacks took place as 32 million USD worth of cryptocurrency were
stolen from the Japanese exchange BitPoint in July. At least 23 million USD worth of coins were customers funds, and the
company admitted that coins were stolen from both its "hot wallets", used for trading, and its "cold"; wallets, which are
used for secured storage and should be much less accessible.
Lastly, as of May 2019 ClearSky has been investigating a newly-discovered extensive operation which targets
Cryptocurrency exchange portals using quality spear-phishing techniques. The attackers use misspelled domains carrying
the names of Google and Amazon services to lure its targets into visiting their pages, as well as well-written and designed
Word documents with the logo of the attacked exchange and matching content, or alternatively, some general information
about cryptocurrency trading.
The Word files we found were password protected, but the password was attached inside the zip folder in a txt file. Upon
execution, the Word file reaches out to a URL shortened via the bit.ly service. Then, after gaining access to machines within
the cryptocurrency exchange network, we believe that multiple actions are conducted to steal as much funds as possible
from the exchange, causing immense damage to the company.

ClearSky Investigation – Operation CryptoCore: Attack Infrastructure Targeting Crypto
Firms
As part of our ongoing investigations we detected in May a password protected word file that references the
cryptocurrency exchange HitBtc16. We found that it is most likely part of an infrastructure that contains numerous
addresses, domains, and sub domains with similar properties:
•

All the domains we detected in the infrastructure are disguised as Google services (drive, mail, sheets, docs) and
are written with spelling mistakes.

•

Most of the Doc files communicate with the URL shortening service bit.ly, most likely in order to try to conceal the
communication attempts.

•

In the address line, after the TLD this routing always appears: -*. 8080/open?id

At this stage the penetration vector is unknown. When we pivoted the domain and the address it is stored on, we reached
other domains and addresses which share identical properties.
As of now analysis of the files did not reveal the attack vector, but we can infer that it is based on a large and dedicated
infrastructure. We recommend adding the attached indicators into the organization's monitoring systems. Moreover, since
the domains have names that appear legitimate but are actually malicious, we recommend presenting them to
employees, and make sure they are mindful of the links they open.

Additional files
In early July we identified new IP addresses attributed to this infrastructure. After carrying out additional investigation, we
detected an empty word file sample that communicates to the domain named service[.]amzonnews[.]club, which is
hosted on a server with the address 75[.]133[.]9[.]84. The file named "Introduction to the World Blockchain
Association.doc", was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil on June 26th, and was identified as malicious by 5 antivirus
engines.17

The Digital Cold War
The Deterrence theory, which gained prominence during the Cold War, states that an inferior force, with lower destructive
capabilities, could deter a more powerful adversary as long as it maintains the ability to protect itself against a surprise
attack. It is based on the fear from reprisal, and as such, the deterrent weapon must be ready, but not necessarily used in
full force.
In the summer of 2017, a unique malware has hit the industrial safety systems of a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia.18
The malware was designed to manipulate the Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) – by altering the system
controllers to a failed safe state the entire industrial system automatically shuts down.
The SIS controllers are the last line of defense against physical disasters in Industrial Control Systems, meant to kick in if
danger is detected. Therefore, their proper detection capabilities are a key to the function of the entire system, and if they
are not intact, real danger is posed to the facility employees and surrounding. Considering the dangers petrochemical
plant poses, makes the malware even more of a milestone in the cyber threat timeline. Dubbed Triton, in late 2018 the
malware was attributed to a Russian Government-Owned institution – The Central Scientific Research Institute of
Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM).19
While the security community had been made aware of the threats posed to Industrial control systems, Triton follows a
small number of publicly exposed incidents in which a malicious software successfully infected an Industrial Control
System. The most recent one would be Industroyer, which targeted Ukraine’s power grid and deprived a part of Kiev of
power for an hour. Some believe that the implementation of the malware was a test, in preparation a real need.
Industroyer followed the Notorious Stuxnet, that in 2010 damaged Iran's centrifuges in the process of separating nuclear
material.
The first half of 2019 demonstrates that The Deterrence theory is now more relevant than ever, with a new weapon in its
core – a full-power SCADA attack; the ability to cripple a national infrastructure by sabotaging its core systems, thus
preventing its civilians and leaders from accessing vital services and perform, daily functions.
In March 2019, it has been reported that the authors of the Triton malware are now on researching additional targets in
North America and other parts of the world.20 While a big SCADA attack has not been observed, the attack timeline detailed
above makes it clear that it is only a matter of time until a radical move in the global political sphere will lead to a
precedent. It is now clear that an expanding number of entities, most of them government-backed, are possessing or in the
development process of malware capable of affecting such infrastructure.

Just like the nuclear deterrence theory, we believe that powerful countries – notably Russia and the United States – are
now realizing that possessing such abilities, mainly on the systems used by their adversaries', as a key part of the up-todate global deterrence equation.

The escalation of the digital cold war
Cyber espionage capabilities have been a key part of silent, under the radar battles between power countries, including
the United States and Russia, for quite a few years now. For example, the infamous Stuxnet malware uncovered in 2010 is
said to be a part of a joint Operation between The Unites States and Israel against Iran's nuclear program. In 2014, Ukraine
suffered a massive cyber-attack targeting its government networks, as well as a cyber attack against Ukrainian Army's
Rocket Forces and Artillery. Both of these attacks have been attributed to Russian actors.

Russia
Russia is known for its use of cyber espionage, Denial of Service (DoS) and destruction tools as part of its territorial and
political conflicts – the diplomatic row with Estonia in 2007, the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 and the Russian military
intervention in Ukraine as of 2014.
There is no doubt that the key turning point in the Russia-United States cyber dispute was the 2016 United States
presidential elections. In 2015 an attack against the American Democratic National Committee (NDC) led to the leakage of
almost 20,000 private emails.21 It was shortly followed by additional exfiltration attacks to the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee (DCCC), and Clinton campaign officials. These acts is affiliated with Russia's Main Intelligence
Directorate, commonly known as the GRU. Russian institutions are known for their vast interference in the 2016 elections
with the goal of harming the leading democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton, and boosting the president Donald Trump.
The main vector of intervention observed around the elections is undoubtfully disinformation campaigns, mostly referred
to as 'fake news'. On the months prior to the elections, Russian companies and activists carried out an immense operation
social media campaign meant to distribute their propaganda. The campaigns used thousands of designated fraudulent
social media accounts and online advertising space to promote events in support of Trump, radical political groups and
Clinton opponents. These accounts were managed by a troll farm disguised under the name The Internet Research Agency
(IRA), most likely linked to the Kremlin.
Although the Russian interference actions were widely investigated by the United States Congress and the FBI, similar acts
took place again on the 2018 presidential mid-term elections. However, this time, the United Scape Cyber Command
responded with an offensive campaign against the IRA.22 The operation rendered the farm entirely offline during Election
Day and is considered one of the most aggressive publicly reported campaigns launched by the Cyber Command.
In late 2018, ClearSky investigators revealed an extensive and well-managed Iranian disinformation infrastructure used by
the to distribute modified content in over 28 countries23. The Russian disinformation campaign filled an important role in
the global cyber landscape, as it raised great awareness to the unprecedented impact of fake news campaigns. In 2019, we
can clearly state that the public knowledge of the presence of fake news on all social media channels is as high as it could
be.
The Cyber Command's takedown on the IRA marks a milestone in the history of cyber. However, the first half of 2019 marks
in ever greater escalation in the use of cyber warfare as part of the United States-Russia tension. For the first time, Trump
administration officials reported that US software code was deployed inside Russia's power grid and other targets.24 While

the operation is meant to display power and warn President Vladimir V. Putin, the Kremlin states that this act means there
is a hypothetical possibility of a cyber war.
To conclude, the below examination of the change in the United States-Russia cyber conflict demonstrates that cyber
warfare acts, whether committed by hacktivists or nation-sponsored groups, have become an actual possibility, and an
integral part of the civilians' everyday lives.

China
China has been implementing aggressive political and economic moves in recent years with the aim of becoming the
world's leading power country within the next decade. Three prominent Chinese programs in this regard are the following:
•

Made in China 2025 – An aggressive government program that promotes the development to a China as a hightech power country by developing, manufacturing and purchasing local technologies.25

•

Belt and Road (aka ‘One Belt, One Road’) – A government program that promotes the development of road and
rail infrastructure across 152 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. This project has been criticized
by many parties around the world who claim corruption and exploitative conditions affecting long-term
countries, as well as blatant use of the project to promote Chinese interests around the world at the expense of
various countries. For this reason, this program was called Debt-trap diplomacy.

•

World Leading Programs in the development and supply of 5th Generation Mobile Internet Technologies - 5G.

In light of these plans, we have seen a spike in Chinese APT attack campaigns targeting the private, political and security
sectors worldwide as of 2018. In this context, we must mention the infamous supply chain attack against HP and IBM
carried out by APT10, the theft of sensitive British and US government military documents from military suppliers and the
theft of advanced commercial developments from technology companies and academic institutions around the world.
In October 2018 a long-term espionage campaign which took place from 2010 to 2015 was unveiled by the Chinese
government's intelligence agency - MSS (Ministry of State Security).26 During the campaign at least 12 aerospace
technology companies were hacked. Among other things, intellectual property had been stolen with the aim of assisting
Chinese government companies in developing a new jet engine. This incident is one of many industrial espionage activities
carried out by Chinese actors in an attempt to gain intellectual property from Western companies to promote Chinese
produce.
One of the major events, which is still ongoing, is the confrontation between the US government and the Chinese
telecommunications company Huawei. This confrontation includes the arrest of Meng Wangzhuo - CFO and daughter of
the company's founder. This happened in tandem with the imposition of trade restrictions with Huawei, which could
disrupt the international operations of a company's cellular and computer divisions, and lead to 30 billion USD in losses. In
parallel to these events, both countries have declared protective tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in import and
export. As of mid-July 2019, these restrictions are planned to be removed, but the company's future is still unclear. 27
It is important to remember that most large Chinese companies have close ties to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).
When it comes to Huawei, founder and CEO of Ren Zhengfei is a party member and is closely related to state president Xi
Jinping. Accordingly, every action Huawei does is primarily aimed at promoting China. Although officially Huawei and
other Chinese companies such as ZTE are private companies, the US government has defined them as "an arm of the
Chinese government".

In October 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek magazine published an article stating that China has installed spyware on 30
major Western technology companies, among them Amazon and Apple.28 All companies involved have denied this claim
and at the same time no additional evidence has been revealed. Due to the vast dependency of Western companies in
manufacturing in China, this concern seems to be pointing to a probable espionage vector. In light of this, in August 2018,
the US government banned operational civilians and soldiers from wearing wearable technology, including smart
watches, which could collect information such as location, record Audio or take pictures.29

Middle East and Gulf Countries
The escalation in the use of cyber warfare tactics by power countries can also be observed in other regions of the world,
and is integrated in political conflicts worldwide. An example of this is the crash of a UAE military spy satellite launched by
the European Space Agency (ESA). This incident, which occurred last July, is still under investigation. However, preliminary
findings suggest possible tampering.
Additionally, Russian military activity in Syria involving GPS jamming has begun to hit the Middle East and Israel airspace
over the past year. Intelligence agencies estimate that Russian cyber operations are not aimed at Israel, but still pose a
security risk due to its proximity to the conflict area and tensed status with Syria. It should be noted that, as of July 2019,
these disruptions only affect civil systems and do not affect Israeli military frequencies operating used by secure and
encrypted networks.

Conclusions
To summarize, the escalation of the cyber conflict between the United States, Russia and China may lay the foundations
for a future cyberspace war. Whether it is a state-of-the-art technology institute or highly motivated hackers, the beginning
of 2019 introduces a rise in the use of cyber warfare tools and an increase in the rate of the references to this arena in the
global daily discourse.

Russian and Chinese APT Cyber Activity
Russian APT activities
Law Enforcement Operations - What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger
One of the most notorious APT groups of our time is the FIN7 hacking group, and for a good reason. It is estimated that the
actor has managed to collect over a billion USD from companies worldwide, and over 12 million credit card numbers from
thousands of businesses. Top countries impacted by the theft operations are the United States, Australia, the United
Kingdom and France, and among the hacking group's victims are major companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Arby's.
Saks Fifth Avenue and Emerald Queen Casino.
The FIN7 group has been around since at least 2015 and has been conducting large-scale, quality payment card data theft
operation. Their monetization technique is based mainly on a prominent card shop. Attacks carried out by the group
usually target Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems, however, when a targeted organization uses systems secured with end-to-end
or point-to-point encryption layers, the group often attacks the finance department within the organization network.
FIN7's persistence and prominence in the cyber landscape can be credited to their innovative and adaptive nature – the
group often alters its attack techniques, such as the file type of the attachments sent as part of phishing campaigns, or the
file extension of the files launched afterwards as part of the infection. Their malware campaigns are usually initiated by a
tailored phishing email sent to a company employee, which includes an attachment. The email would include businessrelation content that would require the recipient to open the attachment in order to receive details about the inquiry.
Emails are sometimes accompanied by supporting phone calls.
Another key step taken by the group to ensure the success of their campaigns is the use of digital certificates. By signing
their decoy documents with legitimate certificates, the group is able to bypass many security controls. This supports
multiple evasion techniques taken by the group, such as changing obfuscation types, AV engines coverages tests and
more.
Surprisingly, on August 1st, 2018, the United States District Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington
uncovered that several individuals suspected of being in leadership positions within the FIN7 cybercrime group had been
arrested. All three of them - Dmytro Fedorov, 44; Fedir Hladyr, 33 and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are Ukrainian nationals. They

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 20 of 52

were charged with 26 felony counts of alleged aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud
and conspiracy.
Despite the major takedown step taken by the United States authorities against the alleged group leaders, it appears that
the group has not ceased action. Researchers reported recently that since the arrest, FIN7 has targeted approximately 130
companies worldwide using spear-phishing campaigns and delivering the GRIFFON malware, a JavaScript backdoor. In
this case as well, campaigns operations were able to gain the trust of their victims using well-written, business-related
content.
The group runs a seemingly-legitimate operation which includes the of fake companies to hire professionals such as
vulnerability researchers and penetration testers. Evidently, their procedures are organized enough to enable them to
continue functioning even without their leaders. It has a clear purpose, a successful record and a drive – to generate the
greatest revenue, keep avoiding detection and utilize new social engineering tactics, unfamiliar to the business sector
employees.
Another notable case demonstrating the persistence of APT groups is revolving around the OilRig group. In March 2019, the
actor suffered a great data leak as part of which hacking and espionage tools, as well as C&C components, target lists and
strategies. However, no signs of an operation shutdown were observed, and researchers believe that the group will
continue acting against targets in the middle east and worldwide, while developing a brand-new toolset.
Both cases teach us in the cyber security community that sometimes, separating the leaders from the group is not enough
to stop a powerful cybercrime infrastructure from functioning. Over the past few years, professional APT group such as the
Russia-oriented APT28 (Sofacy), the Iran-oriented OilRig and FIN7, have established their presence in the cyber landscape,
generating massive damages to businesses and government organizations worldwide. While we expect to see more
takedown attempts by state authorities against these groups during 2019, we also believe that these arrests alone are not
enough.

Threat groups APT28 and Sandstorm Targeting European Governments
Russia's interference with political procedures worldwide in the cyberspace is on the rise. The first notable incident, which
made headline and raised public awareness as for the Russian involvement in the political landscape, was the infamous
data leak from the Democratic National Committee prior to the 2016 presidential elections on the United States. The hack,
in which almost 20,000 sensitive emails were made public, is attributed to the Sofacy group, also known as APT28 – a
group linked to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. This hack was followed by aggressive fake news campaigns
spread throughout the social media, which promoted the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
Another noteworthy attack targeting a political entity is the NotPetya ransomware attack which took place in June 2017. In
this attack, government offices, banks, a city airport and even the power utility of Kiev were severely attacked by a new,
fast-spreading type of ransomware later dubbed NotPetya. The malware features were significantly based on the NSA
tools leak. The attackers, most likely the Russian government-backed group Sandworm, infected the update servers of a
popular software business in Ukraine and propagated via its software updates.30
In the first half of 2019, we are witnessing the continuance of this line of action, as both APT28 and Sandworm had targeted
European government-related institutions with spear-phishing emails ahead of the European Parliament elections in May
2019. Researchers reported that emails containing links to seemingly-legitimate websites were sent to government
personnel across Europe in order to lure them into changing their passwords and thus providing their credentials to the
attackers. Similarly to the United States attack, the attacks primarily targeted democratic institutions in Europe, but

30

election campaigns, think tanks and non-profit organizations promoting agendas related to democracy and public policy
were also attacked.

Fake Software Update Used in a Turla APT Campaign Against Government Targets
In January this year, ESET investigators tracked a new espionage campaign by Turla, a government-backed Russian group
that has been operating since at least 2014 against former USSR countries.31 As part of the campaign, the group used social
engineering to convince its targets to download and run a supposedly legitimate Adobe Flash Player containing a
Backdoor. The victims think they are referred to the official Adobe site to download a legitimate update, but in reality the
traffic is redirected to the attacker’s server and behind the scenes a malicious file is downloaded. According to the report,
most of the targets were political factors.
Researchers ruled out the option that Adobe's official servers were hacked and used for malware download. They
speculate that MitM (Man in the Middle) attacks were used as part of the attack chain. There are several ways that may
constitute Turla's attack vector:
•

Local MitM - Using enterprise machines that are already under the Turla’s control as an intermediary between the
victim machines and the server that stores the malware, by performing ARP Spoofing.

•

MitM on the gateway of the attacked organization - Interception of the entire organization's traffic through
utilization of the corporate gateway rather than through specific stations.

•

MitM at the ISP level - the group's intervention takes place outside of the attacked organization’s network. There
have been previously reported cases of malware distribution using this attack vector.

•

BGP Hijacking attack – redirection of traffic by manipulating the routing table, thus altering the route to the
ADOBE official servers so that communication passes through a point that belongs to the group.

Once control of the victim machine is obtained, the collected information is translated to Base64 and sent to a domain
under the attacker’s control. Collected information includes a username, a list of security software installed on the
machine and the routing table. Parallel to the malicious activity, inquiries of legitimate Adobe addresses and domains
occur, as a means of disguise. Once the infection process is complete, a legitimate Adobe Flash Player version is
downloaded and installed, coming from an unofficial source like Google Drive.
In recent months Turla has begun to develop new advanced malware and attack techniques. According to recent findings
from July, the group distributes a new Dropper called Topinambour, which performs further malware downloads. It also
features data exfiltration capabilities. Turla implements a number of evasion and defense mechanisms. For example, it
develops versions of the malware in several different coding languages (JavaScript, .NET, and PowerShell) – Thus, if one
version fails another one is executed.

Financial Institutions Attacked by Russian Attack Groups via Cloud Services
At the end of January, Netskope researchers discovered a wave of attacks aimed at some 42 entities linked to the financial
sector and government agencies around the world. The attacker, most likely Cobalt Strike32, used Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) to distribute malware through PDF files that were created using Adobe Acrobat 18.0 and then emailed. The company
alerted Google on January.

In the first stage of the attack, the victims received malicious emails that contained PDF files that were automatically
uploaded to legitimate cloud services (Google Drive, for example). The emails were sent from legitimate and reliable
sources to lure the victim to open the email and file. The victims then shared the PDF with other users who received it
through the cloud services, and therefore found it reliable. The PDF files contained a link to a Word file called “Doc102018
[.] Doc” which contained macros. When the Word file is run, a message pops up that asks the user to enable editing. After
the message is approved, a macro file downloads a file named fr.txt is downloaded from the transef [.] Biz / fr.txt address.

Chinese APT activities
The International Civil Aviation Organization Concealed a Major Cyber Attack by APT27
Just recently it was revealed that during 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) experienced a cyber
attack caused by poor management and negligence in the face of the event33. The attackers achieved a foothold in ICAO's
network for several months, and by attacking ICAO, the attackers were able to reach a Turkish government website. The
attackers planted a malware which targets governments and airlines was in two servers. Researchers discovered security
loopholes in the network which were neglected. Four employees from the IT department hid evidence and mishandled the
incident.
The incident was discovered in November 2016, when a researcher from Lockheed Martin contacted the information Security
officer at ICAO to alert them about two infected severs. The researcher stated in his alert that it was a significant event with
a high risk against the aviation sector. The ICAO Information Security Officer (CISO) received the alert and instructed to shut
down the infected servers. However, the IT team refused to do so, and ignored the request for a long time. The firm
authorized a forensic investigation on the severs only after two weeks.
During the whole time since the discovery of the attack, the IT employees did not cooperate with the officer's instructions,
and even took out classified information to their homes. A high-ranking official in the company rejected the
recommendations to investigate the IT team's performance, and they were even reemployed. The attackers were able to
attack foreign government websites through ICAO because of the security loopholes.

The attackers’ identity
The researchers assume that the Chinese attack group APT27 (also known as Emissary Panda) is responsible for the attack.
The group is known for espionage and attacks against foreign governments, embassies, and technology and defense
organizations. They are also known for watering hole attacks by injecting malicious code into government websites.

33

•

The attackers gained 2000 critical systems passwords like email servers and accounts with high permissions
(domain admin and sys admin).

•

They could read, send, and delete emails from every user in the organization.

•

They obtained personal information about all present and past employees.

•

They obtained medical information of anyone who used ICAO's health clinic.

•

They stole personal and financial information from anyone who visited the ICAO building, or that was even
subscribed to the website.

Norwegian Cloud Service Firm Visma Hacked by Chinese Group APT10
Techerati posted details about an attack by the Chinese attack group APT10, which is a part of the CloudHopper attack
campaign34. The Norwegian firm Visma, which provides cloud solutions for over 850,000 clients around the world,
experienced a breach in their network already in August 2018. According to a report posted by Rapid7 and Recorded
Future, the attack was carried out by the Chinese attack group APT1035. We express doubts about attributing the attack to
this group with full certainty.
The attack was designed to attack cloud services to obtain user's information. The attackers stole the login details from
Citrix and LogMeIn (used by Visma employees) about two weeks after the first propagation in the firm's network. They then
used these login details to distribute a malware which spread to several computers in the firm's network and enabled
access to sensitive information.
The attackers used the attack tool Mimikatz (named pd.exe) in order to steal login details. They made use of scheduled
tasks via the Microsoft BITSAdmin utility to transfer files from their C&C to the Visma network. Examination of network logs
revealed an employee’s credentials were stolen and used to authenticate to the network outside of his normal working
hours. Throughout August 2018, the attackers regularly logged in to the Visma network during typical Chinese working
hours.
Two weeks after the initial intrusion into the network, APT10 implanted their malware, Tochilus. In order to this, they used
a C&C server that communicates with Salsa20 and RC4 encryption. After entering into the system, the attackers reached
information on the Visma systems by using WinRAR files which were transferred to a Dropbox account. APT10 has already
used Dropbox previously.
This attack method raises concerns amongst many companies in the Western world, since they rely on cloud services.
Visma’s operations and securities manager Espen Johansen told Reuters that the attack was halted before client networks
were breached.

ClearSky Investigations – Analysis of Iranian Cyber Operations
On March 7, 2019, a malicious email was sent to an employee of an Israeli security company which provides products and
services to the military and aerospace industries in Israel. The attack was investigated by us in collaboration with
additional security researchers. The investigation led us to conclude that the actor behind the attack is the North Korean
APT group Lazarus. Lazarus is a threat group operating under the support and supervision of the North Korean regime. The
main goal of the group is financial gain and intellectual property theft – Lazarus APT is constantly trying to steal foreign
money to make up for the economic difficulties the country has encountered following the imposition of sanctions by
Western countries.
The most prominent attacks associated with Lazarus include the Sony Pictures breach on 2014 and the WannaCry
destruction attack on 2017, in which the networks and services of giant companies around the world were shut down due
to a ransomware. Affected companies include Honda, the Spanish Telephone Network, the UK's NHS (National Health
Service) network and the Russian Ministry of the Interior.

The Attack Chain
Below is the malicious email sent to the employee:

The message was sent between two employees via organization’s internal email system. This meant that the attackers
already had gained access to at least one internal email account in the company - and that they were trying to exploit the
access he had gained for spreading and infecting computers within the company network. It should be noted that the
company's internal network is not connected to its external network, making it even more difficult for an attacker to gain
access to the internal system.

Exploiting RARLAB WinRaR – CVE-2018-20250
The email contained the following attachment – SysAid-Documentation.rar

(062801F6FDBDA4DD67B77834C62E82A4)

The file exploits the vulnerability assigned CVE-2018-2025036, which was revealed by Check Point in February 2019. If the
archive file is opened using a vulnerable version of WinRaR software, the vulnerability lead to the installation of an
executable file (exe) on the machine that could allow an attacker to run a malicious file on a machine using remote access.
In the case in question, when the file is opened a Backdoor is installed, which allows the attacker to access the computer.

Malware Analysis
The malware (96986B18A8470F4020EA78DF0B3DB7D4 ) is a backdoor which functions as a payload on the infected
computer. It is a relatively small executable file - 96.5 KB in size. The malware attempts to communicate with a number of
C&C servers hardcoded in its code. A malware sample can be found in the following link https://app.any.run/tasks/64b8f3a9-0c58-4583-8605-78f4faa9ea37/
The following is the list of addresses contacted by the malware to obtain additional commands or to download a second
stage malware:

The reaches out to a domain in many cases and to an IP address directly in others. We assess that the attackers did not
establish a designated attack infrastructure. Instead, they hacked these addresses and utilized them for the attack. This

could be a demonstration of the attack method adopted by the group. Using this method, the attackers are spared the
need to invest resources in acquiring infrastructure.

The User Agent used by the malware appears to be fake, as it does not match a genuine User Agent - and can therefore be
used as an indicator of the malware's malicious traffic:

Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727;
SLCC&C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)

Attribution to the Lazarus APT
Based on overlap in code snippets, file structure and file behavior, we believe the malware in question is linked to the
Lazarus attack group.

Code Overlap
An examination of the malware in the Intezer system allowed us to detect similarities in the executable code files. The
examination revealed a 10% overlap in the code of our malware with a malware known to be used by the Lazarus group. 37

Intezer also pointed out an overlap between the following two malware samples:
f3bd9e1c01f2145eb475a98c87f94a25
2e17b048c7e317da9024a86d9439c74b
These samples appear in the McAfee report about the Lazarus Group released in December 2018.38 The report sheds light
on an operation dubbed "Operation Sharpshooter" that targeted the security, telecommunications and critical
infrastructure sectors worldwide. The campaign took place during October and November 2018 during which 87
organizations from 24 countries were attacked. The purpose of the campaign according to the report is espionage and
data theft from the above-mentioned sectors. These attacks were based on the distribution of a maliciously crafted Word

file that impersonated a resume, using Dropbox. Although the content was written in English, it is edited in Korean a Word
version. After opening the document a Shellcode is run.

Overlap in Meta Data and Behavior
Investigating possible similar malware samples revealed that the malicious file properties are similar and that there are no
other similar files. To verify this hypothesis, we performed a VirusTotal search that included some of the file properties and
two additional ones: loading the ‘ObtainUserAgentString’ function, and a file size smaller than one MB. The query results
confirmed our hypothesis that the files were uniquely similar, as the query detected only two files - the file reviewed in this
report and the file reviewed in the McAfee report.
We detected further similarities in the structure and style of the C&C servers, their location at the end of the executable file,
and similar properties surrounding them, as can be seen in the text strings of the malicious files. To the right is the file
reviewed in the McAfee report and to the left is the file reviewed in the current report:

The Lazarus APT
The North Korean group Lazarus (also known as APT38 and Hidden Cobra) is one of the most active APT groups of the last
decade. Among its most notable attacks are the 2016 attack on the Bangladesh Central Bank and the attacks against the
Bithumb and Coincheck cryptographic exchange portals during 2018.
The group is associated with the North Korean government, and thus possess many resources and uses sophisticated and
aggressive methods and self-developed tools. Unlike many other APT groups, Lazarus does not hesitate to carry out
destruction operations in order to destroy evidence. Among the group’s most famous malware families are
PowerRatankba, Hangman and Positron.
While Lazarus attacks many sectors to achieve different goals, most of its attacks aimed at the financial sector are carried
out by the subgroup Bluenoroff. Based only on the publicly exposed incidents, the extent of the theft attempts exceeds a
billion and a half USD. According to a Group-IB analysis, Lazarus had stolen at least 571 million USD between January 2017
and October 2018, on 14 attacks.

Cyber-attacks Targeting Israel in the First Half of 2019
Smart Kangaroo - Phishing Campaign Targeted at Financial Institutions around the World
Background
Since March 2019, a group operating a sophisticated phishing infrastructure has been targeting banking clients in the
Middle East and worldwide. We assess hundreds of thousands of USD worth of various currencies were stolen from several
bank accounts. Our initial findings led us to believe that the campaign primarily targets Israeli users. However, in recent
months the attacks against financial institutes in Israel have declined. Instead, the attacks have shifted to well-known
firms in the media and financial sectors.
The name of the campaign "Clever Kangaroo" stems from the fact that the attackers are able to transfer their entire
phishing infrastructure to new IP addresses in a short time span. In addition, they are able to bypass the two-factor
authentication mechanism (an SMS message from the bank to the client). We detected hundreds of domain names and
dozens of IP addresses most likely connected to the attacker's infrastructure. Most of the domain names and phishing
pages that the attackers created are disguised as financial organizations.

The Targets
We believe that the attack group is a skilled international criminal group from Eastern Europe, possibly Russia, that
recruited "money mules". These mules carry out money laundering operations for the group, often without knowing that
they are taking part in illegal activity.
During April 2019, the campaign focused on phishing attempts against Israeli banks. However, recently the group has
expanded its scope and begun targeting international companies from the financial and telecommunication sectors,
among them PayPal, Vodaphone and Scotiabank.

Properties
Throughout the course of our investigation, we were able to identify key characteristics of the campaign:
•
•
•

Utilizing fake hosting and internet services disguised as Amazon, Akamai, Google and more.
Disguising IP addresses of the attack infrastructure as to known internet services, media and porn websites.
Obfuscating the attack infrastructure with Fast Flux - a DNS technique used by mainly by botnets to hide phishing
and malware delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies. Thus, the
servers' IP addresses are constantly replaced so they can sustain counterattacks by the victims.

•
•
•

Setting up the infrastructure in Russia – hundreds of the registered domains use identical Nameserver servers –
ns1[.]parens[.]ru, ns2[.]parens[.]ru – and approximately 70 domains were registered with NameSilo.
Registering domains that resemble the targeted company's names (misspelled or phrased differently) and
building a fake website based on the company's current portal and branding, all in a short time span.
Generic domain names containing relevant keywords and targeting a broader audience. Below here is a mapping
of the terms used by the attackers and their popularity within the domains registered by the attackers:

•

The live fake websites were scanned several times via URLScan[.]io. This was done first in either parking mode or
redirection mode to Bing. After adding fraudulent content they were scanned again.

•

A collection of key IP addresses have been used throughout the campaign:
o

124[.]156[.]115[.]52

o

47[.]254[.]128[.]246

o

5[.]189[.]224[.]208

o

47[.]254[.]129[.]11

o

185[.]244[.]150[.]0/24 (A range that was used often – note that the entire range was not used).

•

Propagation via SMS – the most common distribution vector of the phishing websites was via SMS messages. In
addition, fake websites were built so that they would look like the mobile platform of some of the targeted banks.
Below here are a few examples:

•

Bypassing the OTP technology via SMS message – Research by some of the victims shed light on the attack
method:
o

When the client inputs his login details in his bank portal, the attacker connects to the bank website.

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 30 of 52

•

o

He then makes a financial transaction that is usually followed by an OTP message from the bank.

o

Afterwards the victim receives another phishing message to his phone with a link for inputting the OTP
code that he got from the bank.

o

The attacker completes the transaction after receiving the legitimate code.

Money Mules – The money was transferred to citizens who were persuaded to make financial transactions from
their accounts. Most of them did not know where the money came from and that they were part of a fraud
campaign. They were recruited with 'wanted ads' in English that they saw on employee recruiting websites,
without knowing that the employer was actually a cybercrime gang. We recommend investigating the receivers of
the financial transactions in order to check for similar methods of operation.
Below here is a Money Mules recruiting ad:

A report about money mule recruitment has been spotted already in January:
On January 4, 2019, I saw a part time employment ad on gumtree for a flexible admin job which requires just
surveying the supermarkets within 2km of your house residence. i was to be paid $28/hr, with a maximum
commitment of 20 hours/ week. and so given that i lack the time but was in need of money, i applied.
I first got into contact with "arnold smith" who claims to be a human resource manager then got into contact
with "erika andersen", the order support manager once i was "accepted". i also got into contact with "christian
markovic" who claimed to be the hr director, asking for my bank details where you want the salary to be
transferred.
I was four days into doing the "order reports" when they asked me to register in an e-currency website.
that's when i started doubting their legitimacy, and started to search for derby f&b. to my horror, this company
has been scamming people from different parts of the world, targeting people to be their money mules.

Outline of the Attacks and SMS Verification Bypass Attempts by the Group
First case – Attacking the Verification Process of Financial Transactions
The normal verification process for a financial transaction is as follows:
1.

The client logins from the mobile app or from the computer on the bank's website.

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 31 of 52

2.

He accesses the financial transaction section from the interface.

3.

He requests to carry out a transaction.

4.

The bank's computers send the client a verification message via SMS.

5.

The client inputs the verification code and the transaction is carried out.

The verification code is sent to the
attacker.
Inputs the verification details into the
bank, in order to carry out the
transaction.

attacker.
Presents a conclusion screen to the
client.

Second case – Attacking the Verification Process of Financial Transactions
Banks used to offer an option to register a device so that a verification code will not be required to carry out banking
operations, including financial transactions. Note that this feature was eventually cancelled to prevent attacks.
The attackers exploited this feature by planting a cookie in the client's device after authentication of a mobile device or
computer, in order not to prevent the bank from sending a verification code for financial transactions. The normal
registration process is as follows:
1.

The client logs in on a mobile app or on the computer.

Preventive Banking Measures
•

SMS messages sent from the bank to the clients detail their exact purpose and are never generic.

•

The option to register a device was cancelled. Each financial transaction is followed by a specific SMS message
with an explanation about the transaction.

•

The verification mechanism on the bank is explained in detail on the bank's portal, as well as a warning against
phishing attacks.

•

A more conservative limit for financial transactions without verification.

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 33 of 52

•

Each client has a main cellphone number for verification purposes. To prevent changing it easily an SMS message
is sent to the original number. The message explains that a change of number request has been received and
warns the client before further verification.

Research and investigation efforts meant to detect the infrastructure and attackers.

OpIsrael and OpJerusalem 2019 –Anti-Israeli Hacktivism OUT, Targeted Operations IN
Continuing the tendencies of the last years, the latest anti-Israel activism campaign was characterized by lowering
of quality and reach of the activities. Organizers of the campaign have failed, this year especially, to gain
momentum, and so the operation came to an end without any significant activities. Despite the social networks
being full of publications calling for activists to attack Israel, very few of those activists have conducted actual
attacks.
The only anti-Israeli hacktivist effort worthy of any notice this year has been operation OpJerusalem – an attack conducted
on March the 2nd and enfolded the targeting of hundreds of Israeli internet sites for the purpose of infecting them with
ransomware and showing defacement messages. Among the affected and defaced sites were "ynet", "Calcalist", and
several other prominent sites.
The defacement message came after the attackers were able to gain control over the DNS registry of sites using a thirdparty accessibility addon and redirected the viewers to a malicious site containing a pro-Palestinian message and a
ransomware. These affected sites load a JavaScript library from an address of a third-party service called "Nagish Beklik",
which adds accessibility options for people with special needs in terms of vision, hearing, or mobility. From a check we
have conducted, there were 1600 Israeli sites which use this addon.
The primary intrusion vector had been, apparently, a phishing email against the sites' owners, through which the attackers
were able to get the credentials for the site containing the DNS registries and change them. The attackers have performed
DNS Hijacking – gaining access to the manager of DNS entries of nagish.co.il. They have done so through gaining access to
the Nameserver manager of the registrar, a company named "Box". The attackers have changed the IP address of one of
the subdomains to point to their own, malicious IP address.
Both redirects to the subdomains of the "Nagish" site were changed: js.nagich[.]co.il and yad2-js.nagich[.]co.il. As a result,
the attackers were able to serve the sites a different, malicious JavaScript instead of the original accessibility.js. The
attackers have also produced an SSL certificate, which allowed them to serve the file without HTTPS alerts from the site
they have prepared.
The malicious code was written to check the operational system of the computer, and if it's not Windows – the defacement
message "Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine #OpJerusalem" is shown. Otherwise, a message prompting the user to
update the Flash program would appear.
Clicking on "Update" will result in downloading a file hosted on another server under the attackers' control. The file does
not run automatically, but rather waits for the user to run it after downloading. It is important to notice, that the systemchecking script did not work during the analysis.

OpJerusalem 2019 Results
Thousands of internet users received a pop-up message declaring that Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine. However, due
to a malfunction in the infection code, no actual damage to the was caused. In our estimation, if the script had worked,
tens of hundreds of users would have been infected with ransomware. At this point, it is unclear who is behind the incident

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 34 of 52

and whether these are activists. Investigator Yuval Adam (@yuvadm) thinks that the actor behind the operation is
@LulzSec39, but @ZHacker claims it was @Th3Falcon.40

‘Nagish’ OpJerusalem Investigation
The company published an investigation into the incident. In the investigation, the security manager stated that after
identifying the change of records in the box.co.il storage services, the company did the following:
1.

The DNS records were soon updated to the correct IP addresses. It should be noted that a certain period of time
is required between the update and its actual release and update on the DNS servers, both in Israel and around
the world.

2.

The box and the login information for the DNS records user interface has been replaced with the help if the BOX
technical service.

3. Change of DNS servers and 2-step verification (2FA) of the management account.

Iranian Global Cyber Operations
A Review of Recent Events – Nuclear Enrichment and Cyber Activities
In July 2019, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Iran has breached the limit of its enriched
uranium stockpile set in the 2015 nuclear deal. This confirmation followed the statement published by Iran Foreign
Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. This violation of the deal, as well as an explicit warning by European co-signatories,
follows an escalation of the economic sanctions by the United States which was set on last May by President Donald
Trump, after the latter has decided to quit the nuclear deal and urged its alley countries worldwide to cease the purchase
of Iranian oil.
Earlier, in June, the United States carried out a high-profile attack on Iranian assets tied to the Revolutionary Guard Corps'
missile launch systems. This move was initiated following a retaliatory military move that was called off but was originally
set as a reaction to Iran's attack of an American RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone that flew over southern Iran.
Alongside the deterioration of Iran's geo-political status in the international arena, the country has expanded its cyber
activities targeting western entities – notably United States and Israeli targets – as well as continued its ongoing aggressive
attacks against its usual targets, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iranian minorities and anti-regime groups.
Clearly, Iran is constantly translating its political activities and the global moves of the western countries against her to
cyber-attacks. Thus, in the past few months the campaigns carried out by Iranian APT groups are becoming more and
more aggressive and unconcealed.
A prominent example of the nature of the Iranian activities is the profile of APT33, also known as Elfin. The group has been
actively targeting organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, finance and other sectors as of
early 2016. Its prime targets are located in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Some 18 American organizations were
attacked by APT33 in the past three years, including several Fortune 500 companies as well as healthcare providers and
organizations targeted for the purpose of carrying out supply chain attacks.
It appears that despite the constant efforts, organizations and groups in the targeted countries put up a decent fight –
throughout the past few months highly sensitive information about the activities of government-backed groups was
leaked, exposing abilities, strategies, and attack tools. The main medium for this leak was a telegram channel, as well as
GitHub. The first leak uncovered hacking tools, espionage tools, WebShells and target list of APT34, also Known as OilRig.
APT34 has been attacking worldwide targets with an emphasis on the Middle-East. Another group that suffered from the
leaks is the MuddyWater APT. The leaked information included previously unknown C&C servers used by the group, as well
as attack tools that are offered for sale on underground forums.
To summarize, in the first half of 2019 there has been considerable escalation in the Iranian activity profile, from all
aspects. Politically, the country is responding to the United States sanctions escalation with several bold moves, including

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 36 of 52

enlarging the enriched Uranium stockpile above the limit set in the nuclear deal, drop down of an American surveillance
drone and most likely, sabotaging oil tanks on four trade ships in the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless, western governments and
organizations are responding with full power, successfully sabotaging Iranian activities on a timely basis. These powerful
reactions include the American cyberattack against the missile launch systems of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The
constant leaks of Iranian attack infrastructure and naturally, the extensive, in depth research of Iranian APT groups carried
out by the security community.

The Citrix Hack
On March 8th, Citrix, a software company which provides multiple computing services, issued a statement that on March 6th
it had received an alert from the FBI intelligence agency that the company's systems had been hacked by "international
cyber-attackers"41 using a Password Spraying attack – a Brute Force technique that leverages week passwords and
examines them against a large number of accounts in the attacked organization.42 It is important to note that the extent of
the breach is still unclear and at this stage the nature of the documents and information stolen has not been confirmed.
However, it is estimated that financial information and sensitive identification information (such as SSNs) relating to
employees, suppliers and customers were stolen.
Following the incident, the security company Resecurity has claimed that it has uncovered findings linking the attack to
Iranian entities that have previously attacked government organizations and energy companies around the world.
According to them, the stolen database was 6 to 10 GB in size, and included email communications, files, business
documents and internal corporate documents.
While the security community remained baffled with Resecurity’s publication, on March 11, the company updated its
reporting and provided a number of indicators - 3 IP addresses in Iran and 7 IP addresses from Canada, USA, Germany and
France.

Iranian APT33 Exploitation of Outlook Vulnerability
On July 3rd, FireEye issued an update alert to an APT33 campaign from December 2018. The recent alert provides
additional findings further supporting the attribution of the campaign to the group.43 In this campaign the group executes
attacks by exploiting an old Outlook vulnerability that was first reported in 2017 (CVE-2017-11774).44
According to the recent FireEye report, the campaign continued its activity throughout June and July 2019, and targeted
governmental and federal organizations, financial firms, academic establishments, and media companies in the US. As a
reminder in our follow up investigation we detected an overlap between APT33's attacks and another Iranian group –

Sea Turtle – DNS Record Hijacking Campaign Against Government Organizations in the Middle
East and North Africa
Talos exposed a new DNS record hijacking campaign named Sea Turtle45. We recently posted a breaking alert on a new
attack tool and C&C server by OilRig. There are connections and overlaps between the Talos indicators and the servers
used by OilRig, which could indicate that OilRig are responsible for the attack.
Main targets: military, defense, and intelligence organizations, governmental departments and offices including foreign,
energy and critical infrastructure departments.
Secondary targets leveraged to compromise the main targets – telecom companies, ISPs and DNS registers, and IT
companies.
Most of the targets were located in the Middle East and North Africa. The attackers obtain initial access to the targets' DNS
record management, and then changed the addresses under their control. By doing this, they were able to intercept traffic
and act as a MITM (Man in the middle). Consequently, they could gather login information that passes from the end user to
the targets' servers through the malicious server. Moreover, the attackers exploited several known vulnerabilities for initial
penetration and/or propagation in the target's network.

ClearSky Investigations – Analysis of Iranian Cyber Operations
Iranian Nation-State APT Groups - Confidential Documents Leak
Analysis of Targets, Plans, and Attack Vectors
Over the past few weeks, Iranian APT groups have suffered several significant data leaks. After analyzing and investigating
the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, the loss of data causes considerable harm these
groups and their ongoing cyber operations.
Most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose. The identity of the actor
behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents it appears
that this is the work of professionals. We estimate that the leak will hamstring the groups' upcoming operations and
minimize the risk posed by their attacks in the near future.
The documents were released to the public via three main Telegram groups:
•

Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym ("The people whose lips are stitched and sealed" – translation from Persian) – this
channel featured attack tools attributed to the OilRig group, as well as a WebShell that was inserted into the
Technion, tools used for DNS attacks and more.

•

Green Leakers – this channel was used to leak attack tools attributed to the MuddyWater group. The group's
name and its symbol are identified with the "green movement", which led the protests in Iran after the
Presidential elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)

•

Black Box – a long existing channel, unlike the above-mentioned ones. On May 5th, dozens of confidential
documents classified as 'Secret' (the second highest classification rank) concerning Iranian APT groups' activity
were posted on this channel.

Among the leaked data are documents by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence that uncover information about a group
called "Rana". At this stage, we cannot attribute the group to any known Iranian actor. Activities conducted by the group,
according to the exposed documents, include Iranian citizens monitoring, both in Iran and abroad. The documents also
reveal victim lists, cyber-attack strategies, alleged areas of access, employee list and screenshots from internal espionage
system portals. A document related to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) reveals details about the
development of a malware aimed at attacking SCADA systems.

Iranian Ministry of Intelligence Documents
Rana team
Documents about the "Rana" group, classified as 'Secret', appear to have been written by a hacking and penetration team
within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence's cyber operations department.
A yearly report summarizing the year of 1394 (March 2015 – March 2016) was partially leaked. The report reveals a strategic
data exfiltration operation targeting airline companies. Based on the report, we believe that hacking attempts against
airline companies were indeed carried out. The operation is meant to allow monitoring of important Iranian personnel, as
according to the report, such people use international airline services.
The information that should be collected as part of the operation includes the following data types:
1.

2.
3.
4.

Flight information, such as airline routes that might be under foreign surveillance, passenger identification and
scenarios and detection of passengers that might have boarded a flight in disguise, for the purpose of arriving to
an Enemy State.
Aircrew information, including personal credentials and the number of professionals in specific flights.
Information about high ranking professionals in a specific airline.
Equipment information, including suppliers, number of devices used in a specific flight, plane number and type
and computer equipment.

Another report for the year of 1395 (in this case, only March 2016
– August 2016) enlists several successful espionage projects that
targeted airline databases. Affected organizations include the
Israeli airline "Israir", a Qatar-based airline and a Saudi Arabian
insurance company. The databases of the Turkish police
department and Emirates Roads and Transport Authority were
examined.
The preliminary research for these attacks included meetings
with airline employees of 'Mehrabad' airport in Tehran, attack
vector collection, asset mapping and database Query Language
research, covering Oracle and SQL.
Amongst the documents there was also an image which,
according to the leakers, proves an attempt to conceal currency
procurement – perhaps due to the sanctions on Iran – via a
VMware server.

Targets
Another leaked document provides information about attack
campaigns meant to hack Israeli insurance companies, including multiple top firms – Ayalon, Altshuler Shaham, Clal,
Menorah, Herel, Migdal, Phoenix, Direct Insurance and more. Nevertheless, the status of these attacks remains unclear.
Further hacking targets are Israeli hotel reservation portals, for the purpose of credit card data theft. One successful hack
lead to the theft of 86,000 credit card credentials. Among the government sector, the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture was
attacked.
The leaked documents revealed Iranian attack plans against multiple additional targets worldwide, for example,
governmental institutes in Kuwait. The goal of the attack was to obtain access to a Kuwaiti email service and leverage it for
a data theft operation against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A strategic report from the first half of 1396 (March – August

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 40 of 52

2017) describes activity carried out against Kuwait. According to a report from 2017, two teams were in charge of the attack
operation – the Hacking team and the Social Engineering team.
The Hacking team's work precedes that of the social engineering team. In the attack against the Kuwaiti ministry, the team
begun with penetration tests on the ministry's systems. They then mapped the network and infrastructure and collected IP
addresses, the domains, the websites and applications. They found out that they could obtain the highest level of control
of the targeted servers. The hacking team also obtained access to the ministry's employee database in order to send spam
messages to everyone within the ministry and validate the emails using Mail Tracker.
The Social Engineering team's responsibilities include mainly phishing and spear-phishing operations. As part of this
scope, the team sent phishing emails to a hospital called 'Atam Ananya' and the Qatari oil company. The team also carries
our spear-phishing attack. Thus, the team communicated directly personnel related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
Kuwait. According to the documentation of the attack, it was successful.

Iran Revoltionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Documents
A document carrying the IRGC's logo contains a details about a plan
named Project 910, which revolved around the development of a
malware intended to damage SCADA systems. It is a botnet that features
spyware capabilities, such as remote connection. As of the time of
writing, February 2016, the project did not achieve its goals despite its
high budget.

MuddyWater APT Attack Infrastructure Targeting Turkish and Kurdish Organizations Exposed
As part of our ongoing monitoring of the Iranian attack groups, in April 2019 we found documents we linked to previous
infrastructure of the Iranian APT group MuddyWater. In previous research, we detected two domains that were hacked by
the group (one of them Israeli) and used to store malicious code snippet of the POWERSTATS malware affiliated with the
group. For more information on the outline of the attack, please visit the ClearSky blog.46
Unlike the previous attack vector, we did not identify the use of hacked servers' infrastructure in which the malicious code
snippet was stored, but a malware that comes with a built-in snippet. In addition to the bait file of the first attack vector,
we found five additional files that function the same but contain no content. We estimate that the attackers performed
malware tests to determine whether the document was classified as malicious by the various Anti-Virus engines.

Attack Techniques and Targets
Most of the victims of the current wave of attacks are part of Kurdish groups (such as the Komala Organization - a KurdishIranian party in Iraq) and various organizations in Turkey affiliated with the security sector and the Turkish army. The
initial distribution vector is distribution by an email containing a malicious Office document. Below are screenshots from
decoy documents we obtained.

The document contains a blurry image of the Kurdistan Regional Government:

First Attack Vector
As you can see, the first decoy document contains a blurry image disguised as an official Kurdistan government document.
The attacker lures the victim into clicking the Enable Editing or Enable Content and thus running a malicious macro
command embedded in the Office Word file.

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 42 of 52

This Macro is called Gladiator_CRK. The attackers used this name in the OLE data as well under the name of the file editor.

We pivoted the name, and it returned several documents that perform partial actions of the malware, most of them
without any impersonating content. These files may have been uploaded to VirusTotal as a test to see if they are caught by
the Anti-Virus engines. It should be noted that all of the empty files were uploaded to VirusTotal from Germany, while the
malicious decoy document was uploaded from Iraq - this strengthens our assessment that files uploaded from Germany
are tests.
Like previous cases, this Macro also uses an embedded com object in the macro code that allows the Excel process to run
and run various commands under it. After running the malicious Macro, Registry entries are changed in order for the
malicious code to run even after booting the infected station, thus ensuring persistency. In addition, two files were created
in the Temp folder which contained the code snippets that extract the POWERSTATS malware, similar to the previous
attack vectors. The PowerShell uses Windows Script Host (WScript.exe) to extract a VBE code from the first image file
(icon.ico) and is encoded in VBScript. This code runs a JavaScript code in the file which is embedded in the second file
(picture.jpg) and encoded in base64.
Unlike the previous files, we did not identify any additional servers used to download the above malware and they were
created automatically.

© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd | www.clearskysec.com - info@clearskysec.com | Page 43 of 52

Second Attack Vector
In this vector, we found that after the victim allowed the Macro to run, an encrypted txt file called Win32ApiSyncLog.txt
was created on the computer in which the backdoor was encoded in base64. In addition, a file called Win32ApiSync.bat
(Batch type) - which contains the script that executes the code snippet - was compiled.47 This script creates a scheduled
process on your computer (schtasks) which creates, reads, and extracts the contents of the Win32ApiSync file every hour.
Despite the request to enable content in the document, no malicious macro command is installed (unlike the first file).
This may explain why, unlike the previous file, a PowerShell was not installed on the computer via the excel process. The
OLE data shows that the document was recently edited by a man named Babak Amiri. In this case, too, we found several
other documents under this name, but they also did not contain a Macro. These documents share identical properties:

Via further searches we performed we identified that in previous attacks the use of the Routing 46.105.84 [.] 146: 443 /
WordOffice.jpg was noted for downloading images containing the malicious code snippet. Here are the two servers that
were identified in our Shodan scan as having the same characteristics and are probably part of the same infrastructure:
