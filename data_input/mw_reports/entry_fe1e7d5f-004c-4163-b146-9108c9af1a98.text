The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA; Arabic: ‫ )اﻟﺠﯿﺶ اﻟﺴﻮري اﻹﻟﻜﺘﺮوﻧﻲ‬is a group of computer
hackers which first surfaced online in 2011 to support the government of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad. Using spamming, website defacement, malware, phishing, and denial-ofservice attacks, it has targeted terrorist organizations, political opposition groups, western
news outlets, human rights groups and websites that are seemingly neutral to the Syrian
conflict. It has also hacked government websites in the Middle East and Europe, as well as

13/27

US defense contractors. As of 2011 the SEA has been "the first Arab country to have a
public Internet Army hosted on its national networks to openly launch cyber attacks on its
enemies".[2]
The precise nature of SEA's relationship with the Syrian government has changed over time
and is unclear.[3]

Origins and historical context
In the 1990s Syrian President Bashar al-Assad headed the Syrian Computer Society, which
is connected to the SEA, according to research by University of Toronto and University of
Cambridge, UK.[2] There is evidence that a Syrian Malware Team goes as far back as
January 1, 2011.[4] In February 2011, after years of Internet censorship, Syrian censors lifted
a ban on Facebook and YouTube.[2] In April 2011, only days after anti-regime protests
escalated in Syria, Syrian Electronic Army emerged on Facebook.[2] On May 5, 2011 the
Syrian Computer Society registered SEA’s website (syrian-es.com).[2] Because Syria's
domain registration authority registered the hacker site, some security experts have written
that the group was supervised by the Syrian state.[5] SEA claimed on its webpage to be no
official entity, but "a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards
the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria".[6] As soon as May 27, 2011
SEA had removed text that denied it was an official entity.[2] One commentator has noted that
"[SEA] volunteers might include Syrian diaspora; some of their hacks have used colloquial
English and Reddit memes.[7] In July 2011, it emerged that Bashar al-Assad's page on
Facebook page was run by a member of the Syrian Electronic Army close to the regime,
Haidara Suleiman, the son of powerful intelligence officer and former Syrian ambassador in
Amman, Bahjat Suleiman.[8] He told AFP that "the official media is unfortunately weak... This
is why we use electronic media to show people what's going on."[8]
According to a 2014 report by security company Intelcrawler, SEA activity has shown links
with "officials in Syria, Iran, Lebanon and Hezbollah."[9] A February 2015 article by The New
York Times stated that "American intelligence officials" suspect the SEA is "actually Iranian".
[10]
However, no data has shown a link between Iran's and Syria's cyber attack patterns
according to an analysis of "open-source intelligence" by cyber security firm Recorded
Future.[11]

Online activities
SEA has pursued activities in three key areas:
Website defacement and electronic surveillance against Syrian rebels and other
opposition: The SEA has carried out surveillance to discover the identities and location
of Syrian rebels, using malware (including the Blackworm tool),[4] phishing, and denial
of service attacks. As of 2013 this electronic monitoring has extended to foreign aid
workers.[12]
14/27

Defacement attacks against Western websites that it contends spread news hostile to
the Syrian government: These have included news websites such as BBC News, the
Associated Press, National Public Radio, CBC News,[13] Al Jazeera, Financial Times,
The Daily Telegraph,[14] The Washington Post,[15] Syrian satellite broadcaster Orient
TV, and Dubai-based al-Arabia TV,[16] as well as rights organizations such as Human
Rights Watch.[17] SEA targets include VoIP apps, such as Viber[18] and Tango.[19]
Spamming popular Facebook pages with pro-regime comments:[20] The Facebook
pages of President Barack Obama and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have
been targeted by such spam campaigns.[21]
Global cyber espionage: "technology and media companies, allied military procurement
officers, US defense contractors, and foreign attaches and embassies".[22]
The SEA's tone and style vary from the serious and openly political to ironic statements
intended as critical or pointed humor: SEA had "Exclusive: Terror is striking the #USA and
#Obama is Shamelessly in Bed with Al-Qaeda" tweeted from the Twitter account of 60
Minutes, and in July 2012 posted "Do you think Saudi and Qatar should keep funding armed
gangs in Syria in order to topple the government? #Syria," from Al Jazeera's Twitter account
before the message was removed. In another attack, members of SEA used the BBC
Weather Channel Twitter account to post the headline, "Saudi weather station down due to
head on-collision with camel."[23] After Washington Post reporter Max Fisher called their
jokes unfunny, one hacker associated with the group told a Vice interview 'haters gonna
hate.'"[7]

Operating system
On 31 October 2014, the SEA released a Linux distribution named SEANux.[24][25]

Timeline of notable attacks
2011
July 2011: University of California Los Angeles website defaced by SEA hacker "The
Pro".[26]
September 2011: Harvard University website defaced in what was called the work of a
"sophisticated group or individual". The Harvard homepage was replaced with an
image of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with the message "Syrian Electronic Army
Were Here".[27]
2012
August 2012: The Twitter account of the Reuters news agency sent 22 tweets with
false information on the conflict in Syria. The Reuters news website was compromised,
and posted a false report about the conflict to a journalist's blog.[29]

15/27

2013
20 April 2013: The Team Gamerfood homepage was defaced.[30]
23 April 2013: The Associated Press Twitter account falsely claimed the White House
had been bombed and President Barack Obama injured. This led to a US$136.5 billion
decline in value of the S&P 500 the same day.[31][32]
May 2013: The Twitter account of The Onion was compromised by phishing Google
Apps accounts of The Onion's employees. The platform was also used by the hackers
to spread pro-Syrian tweets.[33][34]
24 May 2013: The ITV News London Twitter account was hacked.[35]
On 26 May 2013: the Android applications of British broadcaster Sky News were
hacked on Google Play Store.[36]
17 July 2013: Truecaller servers were hacked into by the Syrian Electronic Army.[37]
The group claimed on its Twitter handle to have recovered 459 GiBs of database,
primarily due to an older version of WordPress installed on the servers. The hackers
released Truecaller's alleged database host ID, username, and password via another
tweet.[38] On 18 July 2013, TrueCaller confirmed on its blog that only their website was
hacked, but claimed that the attack did not disclose any passwords or credit card
information.[39]
23 July 2013: Viber servers were hacked, the support website replaced with a message
and a supposed screenshot of data that was obtained during the intrusion.[40][41][18]
15 August 2013: Advertising service Outbrain suffered a spearphishing attack and SEA
placed redirects into the websites of The Washington Post, Time, and CNN.[42]
27 August 2013: NYTimes.com had its DNS redirected to a page that displayed the
message "Hacked by SEA" and Twitter's domain registrar was changed.[43]
28 August 2013: Twitter's DNS registration showed the SEA as its Admin and Tech
contacts, and some users reported that the site's Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) had
been compromised.[44]
29–30 August 2013: The New York Times, The Huffington Post, and Twitter were
knocked down by the SEA. A person claiming to speak for the group stepped forward
to tie these attacks to the increasing likelihood of U.S military action in response to alAssad using chemical weapons. A self-described operative of the SEA told ABC News
in an e-mail exchange: "When we hacked media we do not destroy the site but only
publish on it if possible, or publish an article [that] contains the truth of what is
happening in Syria. ... So if the USA launch attack on Syria we may use methods of
causing harm, both for the U.S. economy or other."[45]
2–3 September 2013: Pro-Syria hackers broke into the Internet recruiting site for the
US Marine Corps, posting a message that urged US soldiers to refuse orders if
Washington decides to launch a strike against the Syrian government. The site,
www.marines.com, was paralyzed for several hours and redirected to a sevensentence message "delivered by SEA".[46]

16/27

30 September 2013: The Global Post's official Twitter account and website were
hacked. SEA posted through their Twitter account, "Think twice before you publish
untrusted informations [sic] about Syrian Electronic Army" and "This time we hacked
your website and your Twitter account, the next time you will start searching for new
job"[47]
28 October 2013: By gaining access to the Gmail account of an Organizing for Action
staffer, the SEA altered shortened URLs on President Obama's Facebook and Twitter
accounts to point to a 24-minute pro-government video on YouTube.[48]
9 November 2013: SEA hacked the website of VICE, a no-affiliate
news/documentary/blog website, which has filmed numerous times in Syria with the
side of the Rebel forces. Logging into vice.com redirected to what appeared to be the
SEA homepage.
12 November 2013: SEA hacked the Facebook page of Matthew VanDyke, a Libyan
Civil War veteran and pro-rebel news reporter.

2014
1 January 2014: SEA hacked Skype's Facebook, Twitter and blog, posting an SEA
related picture and telling users not to use Microsoft's e-mail service Outlook.com —
formerly known as Hotmail—claiming that Microsoft sells user information to the
government.[49]
11 January 2014: SEA hacked the Xbox Support Twitter pages and directed tweets to
the group's website.[50]
22 January 2014: SEA hacked the official Microsoft Office Blog, posting several images
and tweeted about the attack.[51]
23 January 2014: CNN's HURACAN CAMPEÓN 2014 official Twitter account showed
two messages, including a photo of the Syrian Flag composed of binary code. CNN
removed the Tweets within 10 minutes.[52][53][54]
3 February 2014: SEA hacked the websites of eBay and PayPal UK. One source
reported the hackers said it was just for show and that they took no data.[55]

message condemning Reuters for "publishing false articles about Syria". Hackers
compromised the website, corrupting ads served by Taboola.[60]

17/27

27 November 2014: SEA hacked hundreds of sites through hijacking Gigya's comment
system of prominent websites, displaying a message "You've been hacked by the
Syrian Electronic Army(SEA)." Affected websites included the Aberdeen Evening
Express, Logitech, Forbes, The Independent UK Magazine, London Evening Standard,
The Telegraph, NBC, the National Hockey League, Finishline.com, PCH.com, Time Out
New York and t3.com (a tech website), stv.com, Walmart Canada, PacSun, Daily Mail
websites, bikeradar.com (cycling website), SparkNotes, millionshort.com, Milenio.com,

Germany to the United States to face charges brought by the Department of Justice for
engaging in a "a multi-year criminal conspiracy to conduct computer intrusions against
perceived detractors of President Bashar al-Assad, including media entities, the White
House and foreign governments."[67][68]
