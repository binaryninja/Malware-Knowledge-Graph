SOLARWINDS ATTRIBUTION:

Are We Getting
Ahead of Ourselves?
An Analysis of UNC2452 Attribution

Note: A previously version of this report incorrectly attributed disclosure of Jake Williams’ work for the National Security Agency’s Tailored Access
Operations group to Sandworm. This disclosure was conducted by ShadowBrokers.

Overview
The recent expansive intrusion campaign of over half a dozen government agencies and as-yet unknown
other organizations through malicious backdoors in the SolarWinds Orion platform is already one of the
most significant acts of cyber espionage in history. This intrusion, dubbed SUNBURST/Solorigate, appears
intended for information theft and espionage rather than destruction, placing this campaign within the realm of
counterintelligence, not just incident response. Analyzing this incident within the realm of counterintelligence
may fill the gap of descriptive language for this incident rather than bipolar descriptions of “sophisticated” or
in-depth analysis which may add to confusion for network defenders. Additionally, only a handful of companies
have direct access and the investigative resources to gain meaningful insights into the technical components
of the backdoor. The actor is a different story.
Like most complex, public intrusions, attribution has been messy. FireEye has named the actor behind
this intrusion “UNC2452,” and Volexity dubbed the threat actor “Dark Halo,” stating that the actor is the same
as UNC2452, though FireEye has not substantiated that claim. Adding further complexity, Washington Post
correspondent Ellen Nakashima cited unnamed government sources claiming Russian actors, in particular
APT29, are responsible for the attack. Members of the U.S. Congress have also publicly accused Russia,
and in particular the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), as the responsible party, and added calls
for response. Microsoft President Brad Smith has also called for strong action. While we expect these
organizations have far more insight into the nature of the breach, as well as classified sources of intelligence
information, calls for strong response should include publicly disclosed information to support accusations.
Public evidence for these claims is currently scant. Some, including Jake Williams, who runs Rendition
Security and teaches for the SANS Institute, has said that technical evidence is forthcoming, but cannot be
disclosed without tipping off the adversaries to missteps and giving them a means to cover their tracks.
Still, the lack of public evidence gives rise to claims that other actors, even perhaps other countries, may be
responsible, a claim made by President Donald Trump as well.
Intelligence analysis, properly conducted, combats bias. Bias can lead to missteps in policy. Engaging in
policy discussions about proportional responses (or, at times, very disproportionate response) without strong
evidence is potentially dangerous. As rumors of attribution to Russia circulate, attribution prior to evidence is
premature and myopic, biasing the analyst to only certain behaviors and actors. Further, intelligence analysis
provides both strategic and tactical guidance for responses. At the strategic level, we can be assured that
responses are coordinated and proportional. At the tactical level, defenders can apply intelligence to seed
proactive activities, such as hunting for behaviors after indicators run dry.

POINT OF VIEW

Among information security researchers, some discussion has occurred regarding the possibility alternate
actors, such as APT41, may ultimately be found responsible. APT41, also known as Winnti and Barium, has
been linked to the People’s Republic of China, and previously conducted attacks which beg comparison with
the SUNBURST/Solorigate attack. (Note: Recorded Future has synonymized several named groups, including
APT41, Axiom Hacking Group, Barium, Blackfly, Dogfish, Ragebeast, Wicked Panda, Winnti Group, as Winnti
Umbrella Group.) In March 2017, APT41 executed a supply chain attack by breaching the company which made
CCleaner, a system cleaner software. Researchers from Cisco Talos and Morphisec uncovered the campaign,
which ultimately spread to 2.27 million computers. While these comparisons fall well short of the requirements
for attribution, APT41 does merit consideration as a candidate actor group responsible for the SUNBURST/
Solorigate breach. Enter threat intelligence.

Noteworthy Techniques
We approached our analysis using existing techniques in order to focus on attribution and adversary
mapping. We pursued methodologies including mapping MITRE ATT&CK techniques, victimology, temporal
indications, and historic use of indicators to give insight into attacker motivation and intent. We analyzed both
public information as well as information from Recorded Future’s historic index to determine a set of unique
characteristics about this campaign. Our goal was not to conclusively attribute this attack, but rather to review
existing data through the lens of intelligence analysis and contribute to conversation on adversary tracking.

ATT&CK Technique Analysis
We conducted a comparison of ATT&CK techniques across the mentioned actors, including APT29 and
APT41. We compiled 25 techniques and 14 sub-techniques for UNC2452 using MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for
Enterprises and techniques mentioned in public reports from FireEye and Microsoft. We then used the MITRE
guidance for comparison of groups, and compared UNC2452 ATT&CK techniques against those the MITRE
team documented for APT29 and APT41 using ATT&CK Navigator (Appendix). Unfortunately, our analysis
surfaced several challenges.
First, there are significant differences in documented ATT&CK techniques between vendors analyzing
the same actor group and/or malware. For example, FireEye lists seven techniques and 10 sub-techniques
in their report dated December 13, 2020; Microsoft shows four techniques and six sub-techniques for their
report dated December 18, 2020.
Second, several techniques for APT29 and APT41 were missing from the ATT&CK groups cataloged by
MITRE, appearing to lean towards more recent attacks, such as PowerDuke campaigns. We used MITRE’s
maintained list of APT TTPs for initial comparison, however these appear to have notable gaps even malware
techniques and techniques for actor groups attributed to leverage the malware.
Third, there were specific instances where ATT&CK lacked the nuanced matching techniques described
by security reporting. For example, within ATT&CK Navigator, several techniques are automatically assigned to
tactics, such as T1078 Valid Accounts, which is assigned to Initial Access, Persistence, and Defense Evasion
tactics. While Microsoft does cite this technique, they limit its applicability to the Persistence tactic.
Additionally, some techniques gain meaning through both repeated applications and choices of what
to encode. A salted FNV-1a hashing algorithm is used in both encoding blacklisted domains and blacklisted
processes, corresponding to T1132 Data Encoding. However, the domains hashed with FNV-1a are also used
to standardize various components of information in checks prior to downloading the second-stage payload,
creating efficiencies for communication as well as obfuscation.
While ATT&CK is a strong framework for mapping adversary TTPs, it is missing elements critical to
describe ongoing adversary activity and map that activity to past activity. Vendor publication of ATT&CK
techniques without in-line context further reduces applicability to adversary mapping. Historic activity
tracking can provide insights into both the existing, and potentially ongoing, SUNBURST/Solorigate campaign
and clues to actor motivation and attribution.

Victim Scope
Victimology, in particular, is notable for UNC2452, as it demonstrates an exacting approach to preserving
continuity of operations while prioritizing victims. As reported in a statement from Microsoft President Brad
Smith, of approximately 18,000 organizations who received the SolarWinds update containing the backdoor,
only 0.2 percent received the second stage, and 40 of those companies, 80 percent of the chosen companies,
were located in the United States. According to FireEye, adversary use of domain generation algorithms (DGA)
custom to each victim allowed for various organizations to identify organizations beaconing to the backdoor
Command-and-Control (C2) server through passive DNS records and cracking the encoded subdomains.

Figure 1: Microsoft graph of victims by industry sector. (Source: Microsoft)

The plurality of victims, according to Microsoft, are information technology companies. While much of
the media coverage remains on government and government contractor victims, recent reports of victims
from telecommunications providers to healthcare organizations, demonstrate targeting beyond traditional
espionage targets.
Some victimology can be determined through the reversing the DGA used by the Solorigate backdoor.
Several organizations, such as the RedDrip Team, Netresec, and Kaspersky published methods for decoding
the DGA used by the backdoor for initial C2 communications. Recorded Future collected and combined
information gathered from open sources such as Pastebin, passive DNS datasets (pDNS), and others related
to encoded subdomains of the SolarWinds Orion backdoor first stage command and control (C2) domain
avsvmcloud[.]com, and utilized three DGA decoding scripts. As of December 21, 2020, we have identified
some 286 domains.
This output is the result of a small subset of open source data and is
not representative of the totality of affected organizations, and is based
exclusively on Recorded Future’s visibility at this time via open source datasets.
SolarWinds itself has said that roughly 18,000 organizations installed versions
of SolarWinds Orion software impacted by SUNBURST, so the list of identified
domains by Recorded Future is therefore non-comprehensive. Additionally, an
organization’s presence on this list does not necessarily mean that it is the
victim of second stage infection or data exfiltration. Specific conditions had
to be met for the malware to deploy a second stage. We do not currently have
visibility into further exploitation. Not all of the records are complete domains;
we have included partial or incomplete domains where we deemed that there
was sufficient enough information to make educated guesses or inferences as
to which organization the domain or string may reference.

POINT OF VIEW

Microsoft noted in its report that the malware checks domains for certain strings prior to execution,
but was not able to determine the domains as they were implemented via hashes. Itay Cohen, a security
researcher at Checkpoint, identified the strings as FNV-1a hashes, and was able to brute-force reverse them.
Cohen noted that many of the strings appear to be SolarWinds internal domain names. In combination with the
checks conducted by the malware to look for regular expressions of “solarwinds” and “test”, Cohen posited
the attackers gained intimate knowledge of the SolarWinds source code, as well as the network topology and
internal development domain names, in order to “minimize the risk that a vigilant employee will notice the
anomaly.” Costin Raiu, along with another Kaspersky researcher, cracked the remaining hashes and published
the full list of internal domain names. Such care to avoid detection is highly uncommon, and points towards
an impressive degree of reconnaissance and focus.

Figure 2: FNV-1a hashes and the resulting domain names avoided by the SUNBURST malware.

Subsequently, SentinelOne found that SUNBURST also appears to check for certain running processes,
and exits if these processes are discovered:
“SearchConfigurations() is used to identify blacklisted drivers. This is performed through
the WMI query – Select * From Win32_SystemDriver, which is obfuscated in the below
screenshot as C07NSU0uUdBScCvKz1UIz8wzNooPriwuSc11KcosSy0CAA==. The file
name is obtained for each driver, and if this driver is found in the blacklist, this method
will return true. As mentioned before, returning true causes the malware to break out of
the Update() loop prior to initiating the true backdoor code.”
Among the blacklisted processes are a number of digital forensics and endpoint detection and response
tools. A full list of the drivers can be found on the SentinelOne blog. Similar to the Microsoft revelation of
blacklisted domains, this care to avoid endpoint detection again highlights the cautiousness of the actors.
Additionally, analysis is needed on the list of SUNBURST blacklisted processes. The full list was cracked
by several open source researchers. A public Google Sheet was compiled by Royce Willams and the Hashcat
team. The list of blacklisted processes is not comprehensive of all common endpoint or antivirus vendors;
further analysis is required to understand why the malware authors focused on certain endpoint software
to blacklist.

POINT OF VIEW

Time
A unique feature of the Solorigate backdoor is the timestamp check that the last write time for the DLL
was 12-14 days prior. Even among unique malware samples, this duration is atypical. MITRE ATT&CK lists
a few attackers leveraging this technique, and none approaching this level of time, but this may be due
to incomplete documentation within ATT&CK, as mentioned above. In addition to evasion, the time-based
evasion appears to be more related to avoiding detection by SolarWinds staff rather than analysis through
virtualization/sandbox analysis.
In a broader examination, the campaign appears to have breached SolarWinds in the fall of 2019 and
made non-malicious changes to code. These changes amounted to a dry-run of the primary infection which
would occur around March 2020. Additionally, the actors inflated the size of the targeted DLL file from 500k
to 900k, which may have triggered detection rules for the file, but investigations would have turned up no
malicious code. When infected code was added in February/March 2020, the size increase was minimal. Time
to conduct these preparatory actions over the course of months shows a level of discipline and patience seen
primarily in intelligence collection operations.

Historic Indicators

Multiple indicators have been shared by FireEye and in other vendor reports. While a number of these

indicators are novel to this attack, Recorded Future does have historic references to some of these indicators.
Recorded Future sees historic collection on three domains from this report:
• The domain freescanonline[.]com was first seen in a ReversingLabs scan
on November 28, 2017, associated with the following SHA256 hash:
21bab0d279d15a548a84a9d9eed34575b2dc9072cc36ebfe7b517850eea92756.
• The domain also appeared in an additional ReversingLabs scan
on October 13, 2019 was associated with the SHA256 hash:

• The domain highdatabase[.]com appears publicly on a public Pastebin site with the title “NII GSOC
Advisory”, posted December 10, 2020.
Of 10 IP addresses noted in the FireEye report, only three were previously linked to malicious activity.
• 13[.]59[.]205[.]66 first appeared on Pastebin in February 6, 2018, and then appeared as a
malicious host by a URLScan listing on April 23, 2019: https://urlscan.io/result/3df2efd6-530f4973-bca7-4635c083e276
• 139[.]99[.]115[.]204 was mentioned in two URLScan results dating back to June 2019. In
December 2019, this IP address was mentioned in a report by NAO_sec, associated with a
tool they named Bottle Exploit Kit, targeting Japan, and associated with the domain sales[.]
inteleksys[.]com
• 167[.]114[.]213[.]199 previously listed on the Bambenek list as a DGA domain destination.
Additionally, Recorded Future’s Predictive IP Risk Rule triggered for this IP days prior to
announcements of the SolarWinds incident
In addition to the techniques mentioned by FireEye, in its report dubbing the backdoor “Solorigate,”
Microsoft attributed the five additional techniques and one sub-technique to the campaign:
Execution
• T1072 Software Deployment Tools
Command and Control
• T1071.004 Application Layer Protocol: DNS
• T1132 Data Encoding

POINT OF VIEW

These delays between domain registration and certification registration suggest that the actor may
have parked these domains for future use. As a result, we suggest the addition of ATT&CK sub-technique,
T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure: Domains, to the UNC2452 actor.
Three of the IP addresses associated with the second-stage domains in the DomainTools report were
previously seen in Recorded Future. IP addresses 13[.]57[.]184[.]217 and 198[.]12[.]75[.]112 were previously

Possibility of Multiple Actors
Microsoft has also published indicators for a second malware which has been discovered to affect the
SolarWinds Orion product. It is undetermined whether this malware is associated with the Solorigate backdoor
or represents an additional threat actor. As per the Appendix section on the Microsoft blog:
“In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise
led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion
product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used
by a different threat actor. The malware consists of a small persistence backdoor in
the form of a DLL file named App_Web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll, which is
programmed to allow remote code execution through SolarWinds web application server
when installed in the folder “inetpub\SolarWinds\bin\”. Unlike Solorigate, this malicious
DLL does not have a digital signature, which suggests that this may be unrelated to the
supply chain compromise.”

POV-2020-1230

Recorded Future ® | www.recordedfuture.com

POINT OF VIEW

Microsoft, GuidePoint, and Palo Alto Networks have dubbed this second malware, a .NET webshell,
SUPERNOVA. SUPERNOVA is thought to load CosmicGale, a malicious Powershell script. Microsoft advises that
if SUPERNOVA is detected on SolarWinds installations, it should be treated as a separate infection. While far
from conclusive, this additional malware raises the possibility of multiple actors within the same environment.
Multiple actors on the same system, knowingly or unknowingly, are not novel. For example, evidence of both
APT28 and APT29 were found on Democratic National Committee servers breached in 2016. Additionally, a file
leaked from the ShadowBrokers releases showed 45 file signatures that could be used to scan for infection
from other actors, some not publicly known at the time. Still, this adds to the argument that we are far from
decisive attribution.

Conclusions
At the Virus Bulletin 2018 conference, security researcher Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade stated, “Currently,
our understanding is stated in binary terms: ‘is the actor sophisticated or not?’” As evidenced by the plethora
of media commentary around this new campaign, not much has changed. We have attempted to add more
color to the current picture of attribution, as well as attribution in general.
Based on our analysis, we believe the actor behind this campaign is exceptionally focused and patient,
even when compared with other state-sponsored campaigns; demonstrates an intricate knowledge of modern
information technology practices, architecture, and supply chains; is experienced in a wide variety of attacker
techniques; and is very familiar with security researcher techniques and approaches. We don’t have a full
picture of the details of this intrusion due a variety of factors, including at least partially, balkanized data
collection among a variety of security vendors and providers.
The actor behind the SolarWinds breach appears to be selective of targets, both in choosing particular
organizations to pursue and purposefully excluding organizations. Careful selection denotes a set of
requirements for targeting rather than targets of opportunity commonly seen in cybercrime incidents. Still,
this curated targeting evidently included FireEye, a curious choice for a cautious actor. Targeting a company
specializing in cybersecurity demonstrates a remarkable audacity, but has been previously seen from both
Russian-affiliated actors (NotPetya) and Chinese-affiliated actors (CCleaner). We can conclude this actor
either weighed requirements against high risk and believed FireEye was so critical a target as to risk an
entire operation, or the actor believed their expertise was such that discovery would not destroy their entire
operation. Alternatively, the actor may have been driven by a penchant for revenge: some have speculated part
of the motivation behind targeting the Hilary Clinton Presidential Campaign in 2016 was due to her approaches
while Secretary of State. Either way, the boldness speaks to the character of the actor, as well as escalates
the importance of the companies they excluded. Logically, if they believed discovery was at least a moderate
possibility, the actor likely excluded certain organizations from targeting to expand the time until the exposure.
Our analysis of UNC2452 shows no conclusive attribution, however that was not our exclusive intent.
Incident responses and investigations are ongoing at dozens of organizations, with hundreds of others
assessing impact. The leading theory of a single, known actor, speculated to be the Russian intelligence
services or, possibly, a Chinese actor should continue to be assessed. However, we conclude the particular
nation behind this campaign is irrelevant for the purposes of tactical defensive actions. Any single actor
hypothesis would inevitably be well-funded and state-affiliated, based on the operational time spent prior to
breach and the target set involved. Undoubtedly, there will be further information released in coming days
and weeks, as the full scope of the campaign comes into focus. Tactically, Recorded Future suggests following
the advice provided by security vendors for securing your networks and best practices for conducting
investigations. Strategically, we suggest clues be added to public, annotated ATT&CK matrixes of known
techniques. In this way, defenders can identify organizational gaps and prioritize improvements based on
their level of impact, better assessing risk to the organization at large.

MITRE ATT&CK Analysis

We conducted an analysis of UNC2452’s known techniques on MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise version 8.
UNC2452, as disclosed by FireEye thus far, demonstrates 25 techniques, and 14 sub-techniques under MITRE
ATT&CK. (Note: we compared techniques with those enumerated by the original FireEye report on UNC2452,
as well as one put together by Picus Security.) We then mapped out UNC2452 technique overlaps with APT29
and APT41. Picus Security adds to certain techniques to their analysis for UNC2452, including:
•

• T1078 Valid accounts (Domain accounts T1078.002 for APT29)
• T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information
While this is not conclusive, it can be significant. Techniques shown in APT29 yet not appearing in
UNC2452 tracking may be areas for further discovery by defenders. Alternately, these techniques may have
not been applied toward this campaign. Conversely, techniques novel to UNC2452 yet not appearing in APT29
may demonstrate newly deployed capabilities. Lack of overlay may open the possibility that UNC2452 is
not related to APT29, however this is far from conclusive. Either way, if UNC2452 is ultimately attributed to
APT29, this would indicate substantial investment in structure and capabilities.

Differences in UNC2452 and APT29 Techniques
Certain techniques used by UNC2452 have not been observed amongst known techniques for APT29.
Rather than disprove association, these could indicate substantial expansion of techniques. If UNC2452
is ultimately synonymized with APT29, we can conclude extensive resources to support such technique
expansion:
Initial Access
• T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, Sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain
Persistence
• T1543 Create of Modify System Process, Sub-technique T1543.002 Windows Service

UNC2452 Technique Overlaps with APT41

Appendix Figure 3: Visualization of ATT&CK technique comparison between UNC2452 and APT41

Some sources have posited the possibility of threat actors other than APT29 being behind the breach. One
possibility which is frequently mentioned is APT41, which is attributed to China according to the September
2020 U.S. Department of Justice indictments of seven defendants, and crosses between state-associated
espionage and cybercrime. We identified eight technique overlaps between APT41 and UNC2452:
Initial Access
• T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, Sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain
• T1078 Valid Accounts
Execution
• T1569 System Services, Sub-technique T1569.002 Service Execution
Persistence
• T1543 Create or Modify System Processes, Sub-technique T1543.003 Windows Service
• T1078 Valid accounts
Privilege Escalation
• T1543 Create or Modify System Processes, Sub-technique T1543.003 Windows Service
• T1078 Valid accounts

Defensive Evasion
• T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, Sub-technique T1070.004 File Deletion
• T1036 Masquerading Sub-techniques T1036.05 Match Legitimate Name or Location
• T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, Sub-technique T1553.002 Code Signing
• T1078 Valid accounts
Command and Control
• T1568 Dynamic Resolution, T1568.002 Domain Generation Algorithms

Other Actors
Other actors have been posited as candidates for this campaign. Winnti Group has been suggested as a
possible candidate actor, given similar DGA patterns seen in 2019 from CCleaner supply chain attacks. Some
further analysis is necessary, as the MITRE ATT&CK group for Winnti has only three ATT&CK techniques
associated with it:
• T1057, Process Discovery, Winnti Group looked for a specific process running on infected servers
• T1014, Rootkit
, Winnti Group used a rootkit to modify typical server functionality
• T1553.002, Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing, Winnti Group used stolen certificates to sign its
malware
These techniques do correspond with techniques leveraged in this campaign, especially the leveraging
of a trusted supply chain, however the current campaign is far more expansive, both in terms of technical
development and the scope of victims.

Novel Techniques for UNC2452
A subset of techniques in UNC2452 are not seen in known techniques for APT29 nor APT41. Additionally,
these techniques are not documented for Winnti either, however this is at least partially attributed to the
incomplete MITRE ATT&CK group for this actor:
Execution
• T1072 Software Deployment Tools
Defensive Evasion
• T1036 Masquerading, Sub-techniques T1036.004 Masquerade Task or Service, T1036.003
Rename System Utilities
