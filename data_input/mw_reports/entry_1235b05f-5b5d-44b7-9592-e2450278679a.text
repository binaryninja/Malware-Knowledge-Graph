An Overview of a Color-coded Multi-Stage Arsenal
Yesterday, our colleagues from Symantec published their analysis of Longhorn, an advanced
threat actor that can be easily compared with Regin, ProjectSauron, Equation or Duqu2 in
terms of its complexity.
Longhorn, which we internally refer to as “The Lamberts”, first came to the attention of the
ITSec community in 2014, when our colleagues from FireEye discovered an attack using a
zero day vulnerability (CVE-2014-4148). The attack leveraged malware we called
‘BlackLambert’, which was used to target a high profile organization in Europe.
Since at least 2008, The Lamberts have used multiple sophisticated attack tools against
high-profile victims. Their arsenal includes network-driven backdoors, several generations of
modular backdoors, harvesting tools, and wipers. Versions for both Windows and OSX are
known at this time, with the latest samples created in 2016.

Although the operational security displayed by actors using the Lamberts toolkit is very good,
one sample includes a PDB path that points to a project named “Archan~1” (perhaps
‘Archangel’). The root folder on the PDB path is named “Hudson”. This is one of the very few
mistakes we’ve seen with this threat actor.
While in most cases the infection vector remains unknown, the high profile attack from 2014
used a very complex Windows TTF zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148).
Kaspersky Lab products successfully detect and eradicate all the known malware from the
Lamberts family. For more information please contact: intelreports@kasperskycom

An Overview of the Lamberts

Figure 1. Lamberts discovery timeline
The first time the Lambert family malware was uncovered publicly was in October 2014,
when FireEye posted a blog about a zero day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) used in the wild. The
vulnerability was patched by Microsoft at the same time. We named the malware involved
‘Black Lambert’ and described it thoroughly in a private report, available to Kaspersky APT
Intel Reports subscribers.
The authors of Black Lambert included a couple of very interesting details in the sample,
which read as the following: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName = 2.0.0. Looking for
similar samples, we were able to identify another generation of related tools which we called
White Lambert. While Black Lambert connects directly to its C&C for instructions, White
Lambert is a fully passive, network-driven backdoor.

White Lambert runs in kernel mode and intercepts network traffic on infected machines. It
decrypts packets crafted in a special format to extract instructions. We named these passive
backdoors ‘White Lambert’ to contrast with the active “Black Lambert” implants.

Looking further for any other malware related to White Lambert and Black Lambert, we came
by another generation of malware that we called Blue Lambert.
One of the Blue Lambert samples is interesting because it appears to have been used as
second stage malware in a high profile attack, which involved the Black Lambert malware.
Looking further for malware similar to Blue Lambert, we came by another family of malware
we called Green Lambert. Green Lambert is a lighter, more reliable, but older version of Blue
Lambert. Interestingly, while most Blue Lambert variants have version numbers in the range
of 2.x, Green Lambert is mostly in 3.x versions. This stands in opposition to the data
gathered from export timestamps and C&C domain activity that points to Green Lambert
being considerably older than the Blue variant. Perhaps both Blue and Green Lamberts have
been developed in parallel by two different teams working under the same umbrella, as
normal software version iterations, with one seeing earlier deployment than the other.
Signatures created for Green Lambert (Windows) have also triggered on an OS X variant of
Green Lambert, with a very low version number: 1.2.0. This was uploaded to a multiscanner
service in September 2014. The OS X variant of Green Lambert is in many regards
functionally identical to the Windows version, however it misses certain functionality such as
running plugins directly in memory.
Kaspersky Lab detections for Blue, Black, and Green Lamberts have been triggered by a
relatively small set of victims from around the world. While investigating one of these
infections involving White Lambert (network-driven implant) and Blue Lambert (active
implant), we found yet another family of tools that appear to be related. We called this new
family Pink Lambert.
The Pink Lambert toolset includes a beaconing implant, a USB-harvesting module and a
multi-platform orchestrator framework which can be used to create OS-independent
malware. Versions of this particular orchestrator were found on other victims, together with
White Lambert samples, indicating a close relationship between the White and Pink Lambert
malware families.
By looking further for other undetected malware on victims of White Lambert, we found yet
another apparently related family. The new family, which we called Gray Lambert is the latest
iteration of the passive network tools from the Lamberts’ arsenal. The coding style of Gray
Lambert is similar to the Pink Lambert USB-harvesting module, however, the functionality
mirrors that of White Lambert. Compared to White Lambert, Gray Lambert runs in user
mode, without the need for exploiting a vulnerable signed driver to load arbitrary code on 64bit Windows variants.
Connecting all these different families by shared code, data formats, C&C servers, and
victims, we have arrived at the following overarching picture:

The Lamberts in Brief – from Black to Gray
Below, we provide a small summary of all the Lamberts. A full description of all variants is
available to subscribers of Kaspersky APT Reports. Contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

Black Lambert
The only known sample of Black Lambert was dropped by a TTF-exploit zero day (CVE2014-4148). Its internal configuration included a proxy server which suggests the malware
was created to work in a very specific network configuration, inside the victim’s network.
An internal description of Black Lambert indicates what appears to be a set of markers used
by the attackers to denote this particular branch: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName
= 2.0.0.

Blue Lambert
The Blue Lambert implants contain what appear to be version numbers in the 2.x range,
together with project/operation codename sets, which may also indicate codenames for the
victims or campaigns.

Figure 4. Blue Lambert configuration in decrypted form, highlighting internal codenames
Known codenames include TRUE CRIME (2.2.0.2), CERVELO YARDBIRD (2.6.1.1), GAI
SHU (2.2.0.5), DOUBLESIDED SCOOBYSNACK (2.3.0.2), FUNNELCAKE CARNIVAL
(2.5.0.2), PROSPER SPOCK (2.0.0.2), RINGTOSS CARNIVAL (2.4.2.2), COD FISH
(2.2.0.0), and INVERTED SHOT (2.6.2.3).

Green Lambert
Green Lambert is a family of tools deeply related to Blue Lambert. The functionality is very
similar, both Blue and Green are active implants. The configuration data shares the same
style of codenames for victims, operations, or projects.

5/14

The Green Lambert family is the only one where non-Windows variants have been found. An
old version of Green Lambert, compiled for OS X was uploaded from Russia to a
multiscanner service in 2014. Its internal codename is HO BO (1.2.0).
The Windows versions of Green Lambert have the following code names: BEARD BLUE
(2.7.1), GORDON FLASH (3.0), APE ESCAPE (3.0.2), SPOCK LOGICAL (3.0.2), PIZZA
ASSAULT (3.0.5), and SNOW BLOWER (3.0.5).
Interestingly, one of the droppers of Green Lambert abused an ICS software package named
“Subway Environmental Simulation Program” or “SES”, which has been available on certain
forums visited by engineers working with industrial software. Similar techniques have been
observed in the past from other threat groups, for instance, trojanized Oracle installers by the
Equation group.

White Lambert
White Lambert is a family of tools that share the same internal description as Black Lambert.
Known tool types, builds, and version names include:
ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 7, versionName 5.0.2, build 113140
ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 7, versionName 5.0.0, build 113140
ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 6, versionName 4.2.0, build 110836M
ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 5, versionName 3.2.0
One of the White Lambert samples is interesting because it has a forgotten PDB path inside,
which points to “Archan~1l” and “Hudson”. Hudson could point to a project name, if the
authors name their projects by rivers in the US, or, it could also be the developer’s first

6/14

name. The truncated (8.3) path “archan~1” most likely means “Archangel”. The tool type “aa”
could also suggest “ArchAngel”. By comparison, the Black Lambert tool type “wl” has no
known meaning.

White Lambert samples run in kernel mode and sniff network traffic looking for special
packets containing instructions to execute. To run unsigned code in kernel mode on 64-bit
Windows, White Lambert uses an exploit against a signed, legitimate SiSoftware Sandra
driver. The same method was used before by Turla, ProjectSauron, and Equation’s Grayfish,
with other known, legitimate drivers.

Pink Lambert
Pink Lambert is a suite of tools initially discovered on a White Lambert victim. It includes a
beaconing implant, partially based on publicly available source code. The source code on top
of which Pink Lambert’s beaconing implant was created is “A Fully Featured Windows HTTP
Wrapper in C++”.

Other tools in the Pink Lambert suite include USB stealer modules and a very complex multiplatform orchestrator.

In a second incident, a Pink Lambert orchestrator was found on another White Lambert
victim, substantiating the connection between the Pink and White Lamberts.

Gray Lambert
Gray Lambert is the most recent tool in the Lamberts’ arsenal. It is a network-driven
backdoor, similar in functionality to White Lambert. Unlike White Lambert, which runs in
kernel mode, Gray Lambert is a user-mode implant. The compilation and coding style of
Gray Lambert is similar to the Pink Lambert USB stealers. Gray Lambert initially appeared
on the computers of victims infected by White Lambert, which could suggest the authors
were upgrading White Lambert infections to Gray. This migration activity was last observed in
October 2016.
Some of the known filenames for Gray Lambert are mwapi32.dll and poolstr.dll – it should be
pointed though that the filenames used by the Lamberts are generally unique and have
never been used twice.

Timeline
Most of the Blue and Green Lambert samples have two C&C servers hardcoded in their
configuration block: a hostname and an IP address. Using our own pDNS as well as
DomainTools IP history, we plotted the times when the C&C servers were active and pointing
to the same IP address as the one from the configuration block.
Unfortunately, this method doesn’t work for all samples, since some of them don’t have a
domain for C&C. Additionally, in some cases we couldn’t find any pDNS information for the
hostname configured in the malware.
Luckily, the attackers have made a few mistakes, which allow us to identify the activity times
for most of the other samples. For instance, in case when no pDNS information was
available for a subdomain on top of the main C&C domain, the domain registration dates
were sufficient to point out when the activity began. Additionally, in some cases the top
domain pointed to the same IP address as the one from the configuration file, allowing us to
identify the activity times.
Another worthwhile analysis method focuses on the set of Blue Lambert samples that have
exports. Although most compilation timestamps in the PE header appear to have been
tampered (to reflect a 2003-2004 range), the authors forgot to alter the timestamps in the
export section. This allowed us to identify not just the activity / compilation timestamps, but
also the method used for faking the compilation timestamps in the PE header.
It seems the algorithm used to tamper with the samples was the following: subtract 0x10
from the highest byte of timestamp (which amounts to about 8 and half years) and then
randomize the lowest 3 bytes. This way we conclude that for Blue Lamberts, that original

8/14

compilation time of samples was in the range of 2012-2015.
Putting together all the various families, with recovered activity times, we come to the
following picture:

Figure 8. A timeline of activity for known Lamberts
As it can be seen from the chart above, Green Lambert is the oldest and longest-running in
the family, while Gray is the newest. White, Blue and Pink somehow overlap in deployment,
with Blue replacing Green Lambert. Black Lambert was seen only briefly and we assume it
was “retired” from the arsenal after being discovered by FireEye in 2014.

Codenames and Popular Culture Referenced in Lamberts
The threat group(s) behind the Lambert toolkits have used a large number of codenames
extensively throughout their projects. Some of these codenames are references to old
computer games, Star Trek, and cartoons, which is very unusual for high profile APT groups.
We really enjoyed going through the backstories of these codenames and wanted to provide
them below for others to enjoy as well.
For instance, one of the Green Lambert versions has the internal codename “GORDON
FLASH”, which can also be read as “FLASH GORDON”. Flash Gordon is the hero of a space
opera adventure comic strip created by and originally drawn by Alex Raymond. It was first
published in 1934 and subsequently turned into a popular film in 1980.

A ‘Funnel cake’ is a regional food popular in North America at carnivals, fairs, sporting
events, and seaside resorts. This explains the codename “FUNNELCAKE CARNIVAL”:

Figure 9. A typical funnel cake
Spock and Prosper obviously refers to Star Trek, the well-known science fiction television
series created by Gene Roddenberry. Cdr. Spock is a half-Vulcan, half-human character,
portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. “Live long and prosper” is the traditional Vulcan greeting in the
series.

DOUBLESIDED SCOOBYSNACK is likely a reference to an NFL Lip Reading video featuring
Adrian Peterson that went viral in mid-2013. According to the urban dictionary, it is also used
to denote a sexual game in which the participants are dressed as Scooby-Doo and his
master.
Ape Escape (also known as Saru Get You (サルゲッチュ Saru Getchu) in Japan) is a series
of video games made by SCE Japan Studio, starting with Ape Escape for PlayStation in
1999. The series often incorporates ape-related humor, unique gameplay, and a wide variety
of pop culture references; it is also notable for being the first game to make the DualShock or
Dual Analog controller mandatory.

Ape Escape
INVERTED SHOT is likely a reference to a mixed martial arts move also known as an
‘Imanari roll takedown’, named after Masakazu Imanari who popularized the grappling
technique. It consists of a modified Brazilian jiu-jitsu granby roll that places the fighter in
inverted guard position while taking the opponent down to the mat.
GAI and SHU (as used in Green Lambert OS X) are characters from the Guilty Crown anime
series. Gai Tsutsugami (恙神 涯 Tsutsugami Gai) is the 17-year-old resourceful and
charismatic leader of the “Funeral Parlor” resistance group, while Shu Ouma (桜満 集 Ōma
Shū) is the 17-year-old main protagonist of Guilty Crown.

Conclusions
The Lamberts toolkit spans across several years, with most activity occurring in 2013 and
2014. Overall, the toolkit includes highly sophisticated malware, which relies on high-level
techniques to sniff network traffic, run plugins in memory without touching the disk, and
leverages exploits against signed drivers to run unsigned code on 64-bit Windows.
To further exemplify the proficiency of the attackers leveraging the Lamberts toolkit,
deployment of Black Lambert included a rather sophisticated TTF zero day exploit, CVE2014-4148. Taking that into account, we classify the Lamberts as the same level of
complexity as Regin, ProjectSauron, Equation and Duqu2, which makes them one of the
most sophisticated cyber espionage toolkits we have ever analysed.
Considering the complexity of these projects and the existence of an implant for OS X, we
assume that it is highly possible that other Lamberts also exist for other platforms, such as
Linux. The fact that in the vast majority of cases the infection method is unknown probably
means there are still a lot of unknown details about these attacks and the group(s)
leveraging them.
As usual, defense against attacks such as those from the Lamberts/Longhorn should include
a multi-layered approach. Kaspersky products include special mitigation strategies against
the malware used by this group, as well as the many other APT groups we track. If you are
interested in reading more about effective mitigation strategies in general, we recommend
