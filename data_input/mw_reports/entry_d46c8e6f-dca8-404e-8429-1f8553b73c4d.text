BACKSWING - Pulling a BADRABBIT Out of a Hat
fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/10/backswing-pulling-a-badrabbit-out-of-a-hat.html

Executive Summary
On Oct. 24, 2017, coordinated strategic web compromises started to distribute BADRABBIT ransomware to unwitting users. FireEye
appliances detected the download attempts and blocked our user base from infection. During our investigation into the activity, FireEye
identified a direct overlap between BADRABBIT redirect sites and sites hosting a profiler we’ve been tracking as BACKSWING. We’ve
identified 51 sites hosting BACKSWING and four confirmed to drop BADRABBIT. Throughout 2017, we observed two versions of
BACKSWING and saw a significant increase in May with an apparent focus on compromising Ukrainian websites. The pattern of deployment
raises the possibility of a strategic sponsor with specific regional interests and suggest a motivation other than financial gain. Given that many
domains are still compromised with BACKSWING, we anticipate that there is a risk that they will be used for future attacks.
Incident Background
Beginning on Oct. 24 at 08:00 UTC, FireEye detected and blocked attempts to infect multiple clients with a drive-by download masquerading
as a Flash Update (install_flash_player.exe) that delivered a wormable variant of ransomware. Users were redirected to the infected site from
multiple legitimate sites (e.g. http://www.mediaport[.]ua/sites/default/files/page-main.js) simultaneously, indicating a coordinated and
widespread strategic web compromise campaign.
FireEye network devices blocked infection attempts at over a dozen victims primarily in Germany, Japan, and the U.S. until Oct. 24 at 15:00
UTC, when the infection attempts ceased and attacker infrastructure – both 1dnscontrol[.]com and the legitimate websites containing the rogue
code – were taken offline.
BACKSWING Framework Likely Connected to BADRABBIT Activity
Strategic web compromises can have a significant amount of collateral targeting. It is common for threat actors to pair a strategic web
compromise with profiling malware to target systems with specific application versions or victims. FireEye observed that BACKSWING, a
malicious JavaScript profiling framework, was deployed to at least 54 legitimate sites starting as early as September 2016. A handful of these
sites were later used to redirect to BADRABBIT distribution URLs.
FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence tracks two distinct versions of BACKSWING that contain the same functionality, but differ in their code styles. We
consider BACKSWING a generic container used to select attributes of the current browsing session (User-Agent, HTTP Referrer, Cookies, and
the current domain). This information is then relayed to a “C2” sometimes to referred to as a “receiver.” If the receiver is online, the server
returns a unique JSON blob to the caller which is then parsed by the BACKSWING code (Figure 1).

1/13

Figure 1: BACKSWING Reply
BACKSWING anticipates the JSON blob to have two fields, “InjectionType” (expected to be an integer) and “InjectionString” (expected to be
string containing HTML content). BACKSWING version 1 (Figure 2) explicitly handles the value of “InjectionType” into two code paths:
If InjectionType == 1 (Redirect browser to URL)
If InjectionType != 1 (render HTML into the DOM)

Figure 2: Backswing Version 1

2/13

In Version 2 (Figure 3), BACKSWING retains similar logic, but generalizes the InjectionString to be handled strictly to render the reply into the
DOM.

Figure 3: BACKSWING Version 2
Version 1:
FireEye observed the first version of BACKSWING in late 2016 on websites belonging to a Czech Republic hospitality organization in
addition to a government website in Montenegro. Turkish-tourism websites were also injected with this profiler.
BACKSWING v1 was commonly injected in cleartext to affected websites, but over time, actors began to obfuscate the code using the
open-source Dean-Edwards Packer and injected it into legitimate JavaScript resources on affected websites. Figure 4 shows the
injection content.
Beginning in May 2017, FireEye observed a number of Ukrainian websites compromised with BACKSWING v1, and in June 2017, began
to see content returned from BACKSWING receivers.
In late June 2017, BACKSWING servers returned an HTML div element with two distinct identifiers. When decoded, BACKSWING v1
embedded two div elements within the DOM with values of 07a06a96-3345-43f2-afe1-2a70d951f50a and 9b142ec2-1fdb-4790-b48cffdf22911104. No additional content was observed in these replies.

Figure 4: BACKSWING Injection Content
Version 2:
The earliest that FireEye observed BACKSWING v2 occurred on Oct. 5, 2017 across multiple websites that previously hosted
BACKSWING v1
BACKSWING v2 was predominantly injected into legitimate JavaScript resources hosted on affected websites; however, some instances
were injected into the sites’ main pages
FireEye observed limited instances of websites hosting this version were also implicated in suspected BADRABBIT infection chains
(detailed in Table 1).
Malicious profilers allow attackers to obtain more information about potential victims before deploying payloads (in this case, the BADRABBIT
“flash update” dropper). While FireEye has not directly observed BACKSWING delivering BADRABBIT, BACKSWING was observed on
multiple websites that were seen referring FireEye customers to 1dnscontrol[.]com, which hosted the BADRABBIT dropper.
Table 1 highlights the legitimate sites hosting BACKSWING that were also used as HTTP referrers for BADRABBIT payload distribution.

The compromised websites listed in Table 1 demonstrate one of the first times that we have observed the potential weaponization of
BACKSWING. FireEye is tracking a growing number of legitimate websites that also host BACKSWING underscoring a considerable footprint
the actors could leverage in future attacks. Table 2 provides a list of sites also compromised with BACKSWING

Table 2: Additional sites hosting BACKSWING profilers and associated receivers
The distribution of sites compromised with BACKSWING suggest a motivation other than financial gain. FireEye observed this framework on
compromised Turkish sites and Montenegrin sites over the past year. We observed a spike of BACKSWING instances on Ukrainian sites, with
a significant increase in May 2017. While some sites hosting BACKSWING do not have a clear strategic link, the pattern of deployment raises
the possibility of a strategic sponsor with specific regional interests.
BADRABBIT Components
BADRABBIT is made up of several components, as described in Figure 5.

Figure 5: BADRABBIT components
Install_flashPlayer.exe (MD5: FBBDC39AF1139AEBBA4DA004475E8839)

The install_flashplayer.exe payload drops infpub.dat (MD5: C4F26ED277B51EF45FA180BE597D96E8) to the C:\Windows directory and
executes it using rundll32.exe with the argument C:\Windows\infpub.dat,#1 15. This execution format mirrors that of EternalPetya.
infpub.dat (MD5: 1D724F95C61F1055F0D02C2154BBCCD3)

The infpub.dat binary is the primary ransomware component responsible for dropping and executing the additional components shown in the
BADRABBIT Components section. An embedded RSA-2048 key facilitates the encryption process, which uses an AES-128 key to encrypt
files. The extensions listed below are targeted for encryption:
.3ds.7z.accdb.ai.asm.asp.aspx.avhd.back.bak.bmp.brw.c.cab.cc.cer.cfg.conf.cpp.crt.cs.ctl.cxx.dbf.der.dib.disk.djvu.doc.docx.dwg.eml.fdb.gz.h.hdd
The following directories are ignored during the encryption process:
\Windows
\Program Files
\ProgramData
\AppData
The malware writes its ransom message to the root of each affected drive with the filename Readme.txt.

7/13

The infpub.dat is capable of performing lateral movement via WMI or SMB. Harvested credentials provided by an embedded Mimikatz
executable facilitate the infection of other systems on the network. The malware contains lists of common usernames, passwords, and named
pipes that it can use to brute-force other credentials for lateral movement.
If one of four Dr.Web antivirus processes is present on the system, file encryption is not performed. If the malware is executed with the “-f”
command line argument, credential theft and lateral movement are bypassed.
dispci.exe (MD5: B14D8FAF7F0CBCFAD051CEFE5F39645F)

The dispci.exe binary interacts with the DiskCryptor driver (cscc.dat) to install the malicious bootloader. If one of three McAfee antivirus
processes is running on the system, dispci.exe is written to the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% directory; otherwise, it is written to C:\Windows. The
sample is executed on system start using a scheduled task named rhaegal.
cscc.dat (MD5s: B4E6D97DAFD9224ED9A547D52C26CE02 or EDB72F4A46C39452D1A5414F7D26454A)

A 32 or 64-bit DiskCryptor driver named cscc.dat facilitates disk encryption. It is installed in the :\Windows directory as a kernel driver service
named cscc.
Mimikatz usage (MD5s: 37945C44A897AA42A66ADCAB68F560E0 or 347AC3B6B791054DE3E5720A7144A977)

A 32 or 64-bit Mimikatz variant is written a temporary file (e.g., 651D.tmp) in the C:\Windows directory and executed by passing a named pipe
string (e.g., \\.\pipe\{8A93FA32-1B7A-4E2F-AAD2-76A095F261DC}) as an argument. Harvested credentials are passed back to infpub.dat via
the named pipe, similar to EternalPetya.
BADRABBIT Compared to EternalPetya
The infpub.dat contains a checksum algorithm like the one used in EternalPetya. However, the initial checksum value differs slightly:
0x87654321 in infpub.dat, 0x12345678 in EternalPetya. infpub.dat also supports the same command line arguments as EternalPetya with the
addition of the “-f” argument, which bypasses the malware’s credential theft and lateral movement capabilities.
Like EternalPetya, infpub.dat determines if a specific file exists on the system and will exit if found. The file in this case is cscc.dat. infpub.dat
contains a wmic.exe lateral movement capability, but unlike EternalPetya, does not contain a PSEXEC binary used to perform lateral
movement.
Both samples utilize the same series of wevtutil and fsutil commands to perform anti-forensics:
wevtutil cl Setup & wevtutil cl System & wevtutil cl Security & wevtutil cl Application & fsutil usn deletejournal /D %SYSTEMDRIVE%
