Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the
SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-134a

Summary
Since December 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
been responding to a significant cyber incident. An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor
added malicious code to multiple versions of SolarWinds Orion and, in some instances,
leveraged it for initial access to enterprise networks of multiple U.S. government agencies,
critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations. Once inside the network, the
threat actor bypassed multi-factor authentication (MFA) and moved laterally to Microsoft
Cloud systems by compromising federated identity solutions. Note: on April 15, 2021, the
U.S. Government attributed this activity to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).
See the statement from the White House for additional details.
For more information and resources on this activity, refer to us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-aptcompromised-networks.
For more information on CISA’s response to this activity, refer to cisa.gov/supply-chaincompromise.
CISA has provided this guidance to federal agencies with networks that used affected
versions of SolarWinds Orion and have evidence of follow-on threat actor activity—CISA
Alert AA20-352A: Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies,
Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations labels these as Category 3 agencies.
This guidance is intended to support Category 3 agencies in crafting their eviction plans in
accordance with ED 21-01: Supplemental Direction Version 4. Note: agencies should refer to
CISA Alert AA20-352A for guidance on determining if they are Category 3. CISA is aware of
other initial access vectors; agencies should not assume they are not compromised by this
APT actor solely because they have never used affected versions of SolarWinds Orion.
Those agencies should investigate to confirm they have not observed related threat actor
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CISA recommends any agency that detects
related activity review this guidance as well as CISA Alert AA20-352A, and contact CISA for
further assistance.
Although this guidance is tailored to federal agencies, CISA encourages critical infrastructure
entities; state, local, territorial, and tribal government organizations; and private sector
organizations to review and apply it, as appropriate.

The steps provided in this guidance are resource-intensive and highly complex and will
require the enterprise network to be disconnected from the internet for 3–5 days. In order to
have fully informed senior-level support, CISA recommends that agency senior leadership
conduct planning sessions throughout this process to understand the resources needed and
any potential disruption in business operations. CISA encourages agency leadership to
review CISA Insights: SolarWinds and AD/M365 Compromise Risk Decisions for Leaders for
more information.
By taking steps to evict this adversary from compromised on-premises and cloud
environments, agencies will position themselves for long-term actions to build more secure,
resilient networks.

Description
Important: Category 3 organizations should use out-of-band communications for all
mitigation and remediation communications and documentation, i.e., do not use any
compromised systems to internally or externally communicate remediation plans or actions.
Remediation plans for dealing with malicious compromises are necessarily unique to every
organization, and success requires careful consideration. There are three phases for evicting
the actor:
Phase 1: Pre-Eviction. Actions to detect and identify APT activity and prepare the
network for eviction. Note: for the purposes of this guidance, a network is defined as
any computer network with hosts that share either a logical trust or any account
credentials with affected versions of SolarWinds Orion.
Phase 2: Eviction. Actions to remove the APT actor from on-premises and cloud
environments. This phase includes rebuilding devices and systems.
Phase 3: Post-Eviction. Actions to ensure eviction was successful and the network
has good cyber posture.
Conducting each step in this guidance is necessary to fully evict the adversary from
Category 3 networks. Failure to perform comprehensive and thorough remediation activity
will expose enterprise networks and cloud environments to substantial risk for long-term
undetected APT activity, and compromised organizations will risk further loss of sensitive
data and erosion of public trust in their networks.
Although this guidance provides a level of detail that describes actions to be completed, it
does not describe how these actions should be completed. To successfully evict the threat
actor, these actions need to be conducted in the order specified. Additionally, this guidance
clearly notes caveats and provides references to help agencies develop their plan.

Pre-Eviction Phase
2/14

1. Define the true scope by identifying trust boundaries (including between Active
Directory [AD] forests and domains) and determining the enterprise assets to which this
guidance applies (i.e., determine what assets are within the trust boundary).
1. For example, the organization needs to determine the identity provider (IdP)
sources (such as Okta, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services [ADFS],
Duo) that it uses to issue single-sign on (SSO) credentials and it needs to identify
assets that rely on the SSO credentials to allow access (i.e., what controlled data
sources are accessible via that credential).
2. Investigate suspicious account activity associated with your SolarWinds servers,
especially service accounts used by SolarWinds Orion. Additionally, enumerate and
investigate any credentials stored or used on the SolarWinds server, including network
administration and device credentials. This can be conducted, for example, using a
transitive mapping of all potentially compromised credentials to the systems that those
credentials accessed. If—as a Category 3 agency—you cannot confirm that all your
credential activity is benign, you should proceed as if the highest administrative level of
credentials on your affected SolarWinds server has been compromised. In many cases,
the adversary may have had this access for months. Refer to the following resources
for more information.

Compromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor
2. CISA Alert AA20-352A: Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government
Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organization
3. Investigate potential Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) abuse in your
environment. Refer to the following resources.
1. CISA Alert AA21-008A: Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in Microsoft
Cloud Environments
2. National Security Agency: Detecting Abuse of Authentication Mechanisms

Against UNC2452

their customers

3/14

4. Scope the intrusion.
1. Look for the artifacts from known TTPs associated with this activity. Refer to
SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise: Detecting Advanced
Persistent Threat Activity from Known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
TTPs and corresponding detection artifacts. Prioritize these by biggest value for
the investment (e.g., prioritize these by techniques or technologies that cover
multiple tactics or that provide visibility into shared data sources). After identifying
the TTPs for which your organization has security controls to detect/stop/mitigate,
you can make risk-based decisions on how to address visibility and protection
strategies for the remaining MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and
Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)-based paths.
2. Audit all network device configurations stored or managed on the SolarWinds
monitoring server for signs of unauthorized or malicious configuration changes.
Organizations should audit the current network device running configuration and
any local configurations that could be loaded at boot time.
3. Assess the current endpoint telemetry collection level and configure endpoint
forensics and detection solutions for aggressive collection; prioritize this by value
of asset and account.

4/14

5. Harden the enterprise attack surface.
1. Review and validate perimeter firewall rulesets. Remove all allow rules for which
the organization does not have a clearly defined, understood, and documented
need. “Deny all” statements that identify necessary connections and allow them
as exceptions are the standard for perimeter devices.
1. Reduce the number of systems that are able to access the internet directly.
Note: this action may require analysis by network engineers with
fundamental knowledge of (1) how network data communicates through
agency trust boundaries and (2) the IP routing in the enterprise.
For example, domain controllers should never be used for—or
capable of— browsing the internet. (Microsoft’s analysis of domain
controllers identified that privileged users often use Internet Explorer
to browse the intranet or internet.
For more information on designing networks where critical or securityrelated appliances and servers do not have access to the internet,
refer to the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC):
Security Architecture Anti-Patterns.
2. Reduce the number of egress ports at the enterprise perimeter. This
requires a review of all perimeter firewall rulesets (rulesets may differ
among firewalls).
2. Implement host-based firewalls to make the work of moving laterally more
challenging for the adversary, disrupting the ability to move from compromised
workstations to domain resources. Consider blocking or closely monitoring
workstation-to-workstation communications as much as possible, using Privileged
Access Workstations (PAWs) and servers for administrative functions. Firewalls
and endpoint detection and response functions may have similar capability, but
both need to feature (1) filtering of allowed connections and (2) visibility/detection
for connections.
3. Close and/or monitor high-risk ports (e.g., Remote Desktop Protocol [RDP],
Server Message Block [SMB], File Transfer Protocol [FTP], Trivial File Transfer
Protocol [TFTP], Secure Shell [SSH], and WebDAV).
4. Carefully employ application execution control (allowlisting), especially for
systems providing remote access to the enterprise.
5. Enforce enterprise Domain Name System (DNS) resolution for all systems. Do
not allow internal systems to directly access internet DNS servers.

5/14

6. Ensure that all endpoints that will need to be updated are powered on for as long
as possible during the eviction phase. Note: this action is necessary for all vital
changes to AD to be pushed to all systems in the environment prior to
reconnection and also to verify that all systems are rebooted. This action is
especially tricky given that many user endpoints are not connected 24/7 due to
remote work. Organizations may want to look at “jailing” systems that connect in
this way into minimal virtual local area networks (VLANs) until they can be
verified to have received and implemented updates and any other mitigations
(endpoint detection and response [EDR] agents, patches, antivirus definitions,
specific scans, etc.) decided on by the organization.
7. Agencies using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Microsoft 365 Defender
should refer to Microsoft: Use attack surface reduction rules to prevent malware
infection for more information on hardening the enterprise attack surface.
6. Identify federation model for on-premises resources to cloud trust relationship
and identify adversary activity in Microsoft 365 (M365)/Azure environment.
1. Identify the Source Anchor for Azure AD Connect in the current Azure Tenant, if
used. (This is required in order to sever the connection and restore later).
2. Run Sparrow or similar tools to identify permission and credential changes to
applications and service principals. Identify overly permissive applications,
unusual credentials in applications, or modifications to federation trust settings.
Refer to CISA Alert AA21-008A: Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in
Microsoft Cloud Environments for more information.
3. Review M365 tenant configuration and perform a cloud security assessment for
administrative accounts and applications. Specifically, review all accounts with
privileged access and each application to determine if the rights and credentials
are as intended and still necessary. This assessment should include shared trusts
or identity relationships with third-party cloud service providers (CSPs) in which
the identity is a resident on the CSP’s tenant but is also capable of performing
actions in the organization’s M365 environment.

Eviction Phase
Note: to effectively the APT actor, the following steps should be completed fully and in the
order listed. These steps may affect operations of critical business functions. CISA
recommends agencies conduct a thorough risk assessment prior to starting eviction so that
potential impacts on critical business functions are documented and understood. Given that
these steps are complex, CISA also encourages agencies to use third-party help to support
eviction efforts if needed.
1. Sever the enterprise network from the internet.
Note: this step requires the agency to understand its internal and external connections.
When making the decision to sever internet access, knowledge of connections must be
combined with care to avoid disrupting critical functions.
6/14

2. Reset the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket account (krbtgt).
Note: krbtgt must be reset twice; the second time after the first has finished. The resets
may take a long time to propagate fully on large AD environments. For more
information, refer to Microsoft guidance: AD Forest Recovery - Resetting the krbtgt
password.
3. Eradicate known malware/backdoors/implants discovered during pre-eviction
steps.
Note: this can be done while waiting for the krbtgt resets to complete.
4. Apply network device mitigations identified in CISA Alert AA20-352A: Advanced
Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and
Private Sector Organization.
For network devices managed by the SolarWinds monitoring server, the running
firmware/software should be checked against known good hash values from the
network vendor. CISA recommends that, if possible, organizations re-upload known
good firmware/software to managed network devices and perform a reboot.
Note: be sure to wait until krbtgt reset completes to avoid interrupting the reset.
5. Unenroll any suspicious MFA Tokens. Audit all MFA tokens configured in your
environment, especially those used for remote access. Unenroll any tokens that cannot
be accounted for or are suspicious.
6. Rebuild and reimage systems.
Note: agencies should do an impact assessment for endpoints to determine if they
need to be reimaged. An agency should identify (1) credentials observed on
compromised machines as at risk and (2) any subsequent system accessed from the
corresponding accounts as compromised. Consider:
1. Was the endpoint altered by a known malicious actor action? If yes, reimage the
system.
2. Was data on the endpoint accessed but the endpoint shows no sign of being
altered? If yes, you may not need to reimage the system.

7/14

7. Regain control of the AD and ADFS, by instituting Local Administrator Password
Solution (LAPS), PAWs, and modified administrative accounts.
1. Re-establish control of the ecosystem items that were most easily manipulated by
the attacker. Start with the “lowest hanging fruit,” i.e., items that are low risk to
operations, low administrative overhead, that do not require new skill sets to
control. These actions block the most frequently used attack methods on a
network. Refer to the Microsoft and Center for Internet Security joint presentation
Critical Hygiene for Preventing Major Breaches for more information on
prioritizing controls with the largest return on investment.
1. Audit the privilege levels of accounts that were utilized on affected
SolarWinds Orion servers. Consider only granting the minimal rights and
accounts needed to function, following Just Enough Administration (JEA)
principles. (Refer to Microsoft: Just Enough Administration for more
information.)
2. Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of
administrative tasks. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Remove all
accounts that are unnecessary; remove privileges not expressly required by
an account’s function or role. Institute a group policy that disables remote
interactive logins, and use Domain Protected Users Group.
3. Enforce MFA for all administrative accounts and functions.
4. Create and establish PAWs for administrative accounts and mandate use
for administrative functions (AD Administrators first, at minimum).
5. Enable unique local administrative accounts (e.g., LAPS) and a
management function for those accounts. Note: for LAPS, if the endpoints
are cloned, each individual endpoint’s local administrative account
password needs to be changed afterward to enforce uniqueness.

8/14

8. Rotate all the Secrets.
1. Rotate secrets associated with remote access MFA token generation.
2. Reset passwords for:
1. All AD accounts with elevated privileges (such as administrators)
2. All AD service accounts
3. Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) account on domain controllers
4. All AD accounts
5. Accounts with suspicious activity or whose credentials existed on
compromised systems, such as affected SolarWinds servers
6. Any account where Smartcard/Personal Identity Verification (PIV) is not
enforced (which are on an exception or similar exemption)
Note: the New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes of smartcard/PIVenabled accounts can be used in pass-the-hash attacks and should be
refreshed regularly. For more information, including guidance and scripts on
rolling over these hashes, refer to the National Security Agency (NSA)
Information Assurance Advisory: Long-Lived Hashes for AD Smartcard
Required Accounts, NSA Cyber’s GitHub page on Pass the-Hash
Guidance, and Microsoft: Passwordless Strategy.
7. All AD user accounts
8. All Windows local administrative accounts (including those that are
renamed, especially those not managed by LAPS in environment)
9. Non-AD application privileged accounts (e.g., elevated accounts on
systems that are not joined to AD; some high value assets (HVAs) may fall
into this category)
10. Network device administrative accounts
11. Non-AD HVA user accounts
3. Change all credentials being used to manage network devices, including keys
and strings used to secure network device functions (Simple Network
Management Protocol [SNMP] strings/user credentials, IPsec/IKE preshared
keys, routing secrets, TACACS/RADIUS secrets, RSA keys/certificates, etc.).
Monitor for failed logins resulting from these resets.

9/14

9. Sever Azure environment from on-premises, and conduct M365/Azure
remediation.
1. Evaluate IdP sources. Harden SSO features. (See FireEye’s white paper,
Remediation and Hardening Strategies for Microsoft 365 to Defend Against
UNC2452). Turn on advanced logging and establish a privileged access
management (PAM) baseline (expected privileged account state) for cloud
environments.
2. Harden the Azure AD Connect Service. (See Trimarc Security’s post, Securing
Microsoft Azure AD Connect).
3. Review and adjust federation trust relationships.Note: Microsoft recommends
severing federation trusts between on-premises networks and the cloud;
organizations should migrate to an external IdP or use Azure AD to manage
users and, if the latter, users should be “mastered” from Azure AD. Revoke
unauthorized or unnecessary federation trusts if maintaining a federated identity
solution. (CISA recommends avoiding federated enterprise environments
whenever possible.) For more information review the following resources.
Microsoft: Protecting Microsoft 365 from on-premises attacks
CrowdStrike: CrowdStrike Launches Free Tool to Identify and Help Mitigate
Risks in Azure Active Directory
4. Fully isolate your M365 admin accounts. Activities in this step include, but are not
limited to (1) creating cloud-only administrators, controlled appropriately with role
based access control (RBAC) and MFA, and (2) monitoring, in an automated
fashion, any changes to the established baseline or unusual use. See the
following resources for more information (Note: CISA will be releasing guidance
on cloud remediation and hardening following dissemination of this guidance).
Microsoft: Advice for incident responders on recovery from systemic identity
compromises
Microsoft: Protecting Microsoft 365 from on-premises attacks
5. After remediating privileged identities (step d), revoke all existing M365 tokens.
6. Double check to ensure no on-premises accounts have administrative privileges
in M365.
7. Review and sanitize (i.e., remove unwelcome actions) compromised mailboxes
using industry standard tooling and service portal manual review.
8. Review, and adjust accordingly, Tenant settings and configurations. Use publicly
available or open-source tools such as CrowdStrike Reporting Tool for Azure
(CRT) and Hawk to review Tenant settings. Refer to CISA Alert AA21-008A:
Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in Microsoft Cloud Environments.
9. Use tools—such as Sparrow or Azure AD Investigator—to review existing Azure
applications. Remediate applications that have been compromised. Refer to CISA
Alert AA21-008A: Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in Microsoft Cloud
Environments.
10. Perform IdP review and eviction.

10/14

10. Clear DNS cache on all servers, workstations, and non-Windows systems.
1. Reduce the “Domain member: Maximum machine account password age” in
Group Policy to 2–3 days during eviction; it can be set back to the default 30 days
after eviction is complete. This will hasten the resetting of the Computer object
passwords. For more information, refer to Microsoft: Machine Account Password
Process.
2. Reboot all servers and workstations, especially those joined to the AD.
11. Verify eviction steps have been properly completed.
1. Have all the tasks above been completed on all applicable systems and
accounts? Note: CISA highly recommends implementing a process to verify you
have completed each task.
2. Have the endpoints that were not completely mitigated been removed from
network communication, pending their completion?
3. Have you applied all critical and high patches to the endpoints that lack them,
especially any that needed re-imaging?
4. Have you added enhanced visibility and monitoring capabilities for cloud
environments—such as telemetry for cloud environments—into existing agency
security information and event management (SIEM) technology?
5. Have you implemented monitoring capability for highly privileged cloud identities
and Service Principals?

Post Eviction
1. Report to your senior leadership completed pre-eviction and eviction actions as
well as those remaining to be completed; provide leadership an assessment of the risk
remaining, including assumed residual risk.
2. Reconnect to the internet. Note: the decision to reconnect to the internet depends on
senior leadership’s confidence in the actions taken. It is possible—depending on the
environment—that new information discovered during pre-eviction and eviction steps
could add additional eviction tasks.
3. Create an actionable and accountable plan for integrating the next 60 days of
Active Directory privilege credential baselining guidance (i.e., completing the next
step). Note: this next step has high overhead and will likely disrupt business
operations; agencies must have a plan for testing breaks associated with the changes
to administrative control schemes and will need to alter their policies and procedures to
accommodate these disruptions.

11/14

4. Establish and control baseline mechanisms for administrators. Note: this step
should be completed over the next 60 days. While completing this task, agencies
should move on to the next step.
1. Implement PAWs for remaining administrative accounts.
2. Perform additional hardening of administrative accounts.
1. Implement Credential Guard. (Refer to Microsoft: Manage Windows
Defender Credential Guard for more information). Introducing Credential
Guard as an endpoint tool can be challenging for organizations due to
hardware restrictions, but the impact on privileged identity credential
management is significant. Chief information security officers (CISOs)
should prioritize identity-focused solutions for immediate action.
2. Restrict RDP usage to an exclusive list of necessary administrators and
from only dedicated administrative workstations (such as PAWs) and
identified necessary alternative locations. RDP access should be judiciously
and carefully scoped and monitored.
3. Establish time bound and temporal escalated Domain Privileges (require
second factor for elevation and that access expires).
3. Implement JEA for domain controller access and maintenance.
4. Harden/reduce attack surface of domain controllers. Remove connection to the
internet whenever possible, and remove all unnecessary protocols, services, and
accounts (in accordance with the principle of least functionality). Consider
implementing Windows Server Core for all domain controllers.
5. Integrate detection mechanisms that focus on endpoints and changes to privileged
identity sources. Solutions include pervasive use of endpoint security (such as the
Microsoft Defender Suite of services, including Endpoint and Identity) as well as high
value identity monitoring solutions. The view of user behavior should be unified across
all platforms and behavioral analytics should be enabled. Note: behavioral analytics
(with an understanding of what traditional administrative activity consists of, and what
tools are used for it) combined with frequency analysis of activity is often the only
avenue for network defenders to detect anomalous activity.
6. Report to CISA. Post-eviction, all Category 3 agencies should report to CISA actions
taken, any actions left incomplete, and their assessments of the residual risk. Following
dissemination of this guidance, CISA will release a checklist to the Homeland Security
Information Network (HSIN) for agencies to use to complete the steps in this guidance.
Agencies should fill out and submit the checklist to CISA.

12/14

7. Maintain vigilance. In the hours, days, and weeks after the network’s internet
connection is restored, the agency’s detection capability will be important in verifying
that all threat actor activity within the enterprise has stopped. Extended vigilance is
necessary because this threat actor has demonstrated extreme patience with follow-on
activity.
1. Agencies should ensure their security operations center (SOC) has capabilities
for enhanced visibility and monitoring of enterprise network and cloud
environments. Refer to SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise:
Detecting APT Activity from Known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
known TTPs that agencies should look out for as part of network and
environment monitoring.
2. Configure endpoint forensics and detection solutions for aggressive collection;
prioritize this by value of asset and account.

Frequently Asked Questions
Does my organization have to complete all the steps in this eviction guidance?
In accordance with ED 21-01: Supplemental Direction Version 4, agencies with networks that
used affected versions of SolarWinds Orion and have evidence of follow-on threat actor
activity, such as binary beaconing to avsvmcloud[.]com and secondary command and
control (C2) activity to a separate domain or IP address, must execute and complete the preeviction phase of this guidance. Agencies that find additional adversarial activities must
execute and complete the eviction and post eviction phases of this guidance. Conducting all
of the steps in this guidance is necessary to fully evict the adversary from applicable
networks. Failure to perform comprehensive and thorough remediation activity will expose
enterprise networks and cloud environments to substantial risk for long-term undetected APT
activity.
Is there a time limit to completing the eviction activities?
In accordance with ED 21-01: Supplemental Direction Version 4, agencies subject to the
requirements must complete the applicable phases in this eviction guidance by July 16,
2021, or within 90 days of discovery of follow-on threat activity after issuance of ED 21-01
Supplemental Direction Version 4.
Given that severing the enterprise network from the internet will have significant
operational impact, does the organization need to take all its endpoints offline?
If the affected organization can authoritatively and comprehensively identify compromised
internet-connected endpoints, identities, and systems and is able to take those offline without
affecting uncompromised or non-internet connected systems, then the agency does not need
to disconnect non-compromised endpoints or non-internet-connected systems. This will still

13/14

disrupt C2 activities while allowing the agency to keep as much of the system up as possible.
Note: access to environments with pervasively compromised credentials will frequently
appear to be standard user activity, as it will use “native” services and identities.
Will CISA provide agencies new TTPs in the event of a reinfection?
Refer to SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise: Detecting Advanced Persistent
Threat Activity from Known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for reinfection TTPs and
corresponding detection artifacts.
Will CISA provide architectural recommendations for future rebuilds?
This current guidance is tailored to provide short-term remediation steps for agencies to evict
this adversary from compromised on-premises and cloud environments and protect networks
against additional compromise. CISA will be releasing long-term enterprise architecture and
security operations guidance that incorporates updated credential/access management,
monitoring, and detection guidance for a more secure, resilient federal enterprise.
