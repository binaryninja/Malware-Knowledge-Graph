1/9

Ransomware is a remote, digital shakedown. It is disruptive and expensive, and it affects all
kinds of organizations, from cutting edge space technology firms, to the wool industry, to
industrial environments. Infections have forced hospitals to turn away patients and law
enforcement to drop cases against drug dealers. Ransomware operators have recently
begun combining encryption with the threat of data leak and exposure in order to increase
leverage against victims. There may be a silver lining, however; Mandiant Intelligence
research suggests that focusing defensive efforts in key areas and acting quickly may allow
organizations to stop ransomware before it is deployed.
Mandiant Intelligence examined dozens of ransomware incident response investigations
from 2017 to 2019. Through this research, we identified a number of common characteristics
in initial intrusion vectors, dwell time, and time of day of ransomware deployment. We also
noted threat actor innovations in tactics to maximize profits (Figure 1). Incidents affected
organizations across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East in nearly
every sector category, including financial services, chemicals and materials, legal and
professional services, local government, and healthcare. We observed intrusions attributed
to financially motivated groups such as FIN6, TEMP.MixMaster, and dozens of additional
activity sets.

Figure 1: Themes Observed in Ransomware Incidents
These incidents provide us with enhanced insight into ransomware trends that can be useful
for network defenders, but it is worth bearing in mind that this data represents only a sample
of all activity. For example, Mandiant ransomware investigations increased 860% from 2017
to 2019. The majority of these incidents appeared to be post-compromise infections, and we
believe that threat actors are accelerating use of tactics including post compromise
deployment to increase the likelihood of ransom payment. We also observed incidents in
which ransomware was executed immediately, for example GANDCRAB and
GLOBEIMPOSTER incidents, but most of the intrusions examined were longer duration and
more complex post-compromise deployments.

Common Initial Infection Vectors
We noted several initial infection vectors across multiple ransomware incidents, including
RDP, phishing with a malicious link or attachment, and drive by download of malware
facilitating follow-on activity. RDP was more frequently observed in 2017 and declined in
2018 and 2019. These vectors demonstrate that ransomware can enter victim environments
by a variety of means, not all of which require user interaction.
RDP or
other
remote
access

One of the most frequently observed vectors was an attacker logging on to
a system in a victim environment via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). In
some cases, the attacker brute forced the credentials (many failed
authentication attempts followed by a successful one). In other cases, a
successful RDP log on was the first evidence of malicious activity prior to a
ransomware infection. It is possible that the targeted system used default or
weak credentials, the attackers acquired valid credentials via other
unobserved malicious activity, or the attackers purchased RDP access
established by another threat actor. In April 2019, we noted that FIN6 used
stolen credentials and RDP to move laterally in cases resulting in
ransomware deployment.

Phishing
with link or
attachment

A significant number of ransomware cases were linked to phishing
campaigns delivering some of the most prolific malware families in
financially motivated operations: TRICKBOT, EMOTET, and
FLAWEDAMMYY. In January 2019, we described TEMP.MixMaster TrickBot
infections that resulted in interactive deployment of Ryuk.

Drive-bydownload

Several ransomware infections were traced back to a user in the victim
environment navigating to a compromised website that resulted in a
DRIDEX infection. In October 2019, we documented compromised web
infrastructure delivering FAKEUPDATES, then DRIDEX, and ultimately
BITPAYMER or DOPPELPAYMER infections.

Most Ransomware Deployments Take Place Three or More Days After Initial Infection
The number of days elapsed between the first evidence of malicious activity and the
deployment of ransomware ranged from zero to 299 days (Figure 2). That is, dwell times
range quite widely, and in most cases, there was a time gap between first access and
ransomware deployment. For 75 percent of incidents, at least three days passed between
the first evidence of malicious activity and ransomware deployment.
This pattern suggests that for many organizations, if initial infections are detected,
contained, and remediated quickly, the significant damage and cost associated with a
ransomware infection could be avoided. In fact, in a handful of cases, Mandiant incident
responders and FireEye Managed Defense contained and remediated malicious activity,
likely preventing ransomware deployment. Several investigations discovered evidence of
ransomware installed into victim environments but not yet successfully executed.

Ransomware Deployed Most Often After Hours
In 76% of incidents we reviewed, ransomware was executed in victim environments after
hours, that is, on a weekend or before 8:00 a.m. or after 6:00 p.m. on a weekday, using the
time zone and customary work week of the victim organization (Figure 3 and Figure 4). This
observation underscores that threat actors continue working even when most employees
may not be.
Some attackers possibly intentionally deploy ransomware after hours, on weekends, or
during holidays, to maximize the potential effectiveness of the operation on the assumption
that any remediation efforts will be implemented more slowly than they would be during
normal work hours. In other cases, attackers linked ransomware deployment to user actions.

For example, in 2019 incidents at retail and professional services firms, attackers created an
Active Directory Group Policy Object to trigger ransomware execution based on user log on
and log off.

Mitigation Recommendations
Organizations seeking to prevent or mitigate the effects of ransomware infections could
consider the following steps. For more comprehensive recommendations for addressing
ransomware, please refer to our blog post: Ransomware Protection and Containment
Strategies: Practical Guidance for Endpoint Protection, Hardening, and Containment.

Address
Infection
Vectors

Use enterprise network, email, and host-based security products with
up-to-date detections to prevent and detect many common malware
strains such as TRICKBOT, DRIDEX, and EMOTET.
Contain and remediate infections quickly to prevent attackers from
conducting follow-on activity or selling access to other threat actors for
further exploitation.
Perform regular network perimeter and firewall rule audits to identify
any systems that have inadvertently been left accessible to the
internet. Disable RDP and other protocols to systems where this
access is not expressly required. Enable multi-factor authentication
where possible, particularly to internet-accessible connections, see
pages 4-15 of the white paper for more details.
Enforce multi-factor authentication, that is, where enabled, do not
allow single factor authentication for users who have not set up the
multi-factor mechanism.

Implement
Best
Practices

For example, carry out regular anti-phishing training for all employees
that operate a device on the company network. Ensure employees are
aware of threat, their role in preventing it, and the potential cost of a
successful infection.
Implement network segmentation when possible to prevent a potential
infection from spreading.
Create regular backups of critical data necessary to ensure business
continuity and, if possible, store them offsite, as attackers often target
backups.
Restrict Local Administrator accounts from specific log on types, see
page 18 of the white paper for more details.
Use a solution such as LAPS to generate a unique Local Administrator
password for each system.
Disallow cleartext passwords to be stored in memory in order to
prevent Mimikatz credential harvesting, see p. 20 of the white paper
for more details.
Consider cyber insurance that covers ransomware infection.

Establish
Emergency
Plans

Ensure that after-hours coverage is available to respond within a set
time period in the case of an emergency.
Institute after-hours emergency escalation plans that include
redundant means to contact multiple stakeholders within the
organization and 24-hour emergency contact information for any
relevant third-party vendors.

Outlook
Ransomware is disruptive and costly. Threat actor innovations have only increased the
potential damage of ransomware infections in recent years, and this trend shows no sign of
slowing down. We expect that financially motivated actors will continue to evolve their tactics
to maximize profit generated from ransomware infections. We anticipate that post-

8/9

compromise ransomware infections will continue to rise and that attackers will increasingly
couple ransomware deployment with other tactics, such as data theft and extortion,
increasing ransom demands, and targeting critical systems.
The good news is that particularly with post-compromise infections, there is often a window
of time between the first malicious action and ransomware deployment. If network defenders
can detect and remediate the initial compromise quickly, it is possible to avoid the significant
damage and cost of a ransomware infection.
