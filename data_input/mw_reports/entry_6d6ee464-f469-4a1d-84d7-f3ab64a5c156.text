Purple Fox malware is distributed via malicious Telegram Desktop Installer, this malware installs
further payloads on the affected devices.
The file “Telegram Desktop.exe” comes with two files, an original installer file and a malicious
downloader.The legitimate installer isn’t executed as the AutoIT program runs the TextInputh.exe
file.

Understanding the Purple Fox Malware campaign
This TextInputh.exe when executed will create a new folder called “1640618495” under the
C:\Users\Public\Videos\ location and then communicate with C2 to download a RAR and 7z utility.
The RAR file contains the configuration and payload file, when the 7z program unzips everything to
the ProgramData folder.

As per Minerva Labs, TextInputh.exe does the following actions onto the compromised machine,
Copies 360.tct with “360.dll” name —> rundll3222.exe —-> svchost.txt to the ProgramData
folder
Executes ojbk.exe with the “ojbk.exe -a” command line
Deletes 1.rar and 7zz.exe and exits the process

Later, a registry key is created and a DLL disables UAC the payload is executed and the following
five additional files are dropped into the infected system,
Calldriver.exe
Driver.sys
dll.dll
kill.bat
speedmem2.hg
These extra files is used to block the initiation of 360 AV processes and avoid detection of Purple
Fox on the affected device. Moving further the malware gather system details, scans for security
tools running in the device and then send the hard coded C2 address.

Complete capabilities of Purple Fox malware
After this process, Purple Fox is downloaded from the C2 in the form of an .msi file that has
encrypted shellcode for both 64- and 32- bit systems. Once the Purple Fox is executed, the
compromised devices are restarted for the registry settings to work, especially the disabled User
Account Control (UAC).
To achieve this, the dll.dll file sets the following three registry keys to 0:
1. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
2. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA
3. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\PromptOnSecureDesktop
Disabling bypassing UAC is vital because it deploys viruses and malware with administrator
privileges. In general, UAC prevents the installation of unauthorized apps and the change of system
settings, to be active on all Windows devices.
When disabled Purple Fox will perform malicious functions like searching of file, exfiltration, deletion
of data, process killing, downloading and running code. and even worming to other Windows
devices. Malware similar to Purple Fox are actively being distributed via Youtube Videos, malicious
websites, and other forum sites.
