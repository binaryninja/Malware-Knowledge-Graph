MajikPOS is a Mishmash of Nefarious Tricks
Crooks behind MajikPOS have various tricks up their sleeves. Apart from infecting systems with
it, we also spotted instances where common lateral movement tools were detected around the
same time they were actively compromising the endpoint with MajikPOS. These tools include:
HKTL_MIMIKATZ, HKTL_FGDUMP, and HKTL_VNCPASSVIEW. We surmise that the bad
guys attempted to gain further access within the victim’s network. In separate isolated incidents,
we also noticed the deployment of MajikPOS via PsExec, a command-line tool that can be used
to remotely execute processes on other systems. This may indicate that valid, administrativelevel credentials were used against the host. The attackers also tend to deploy what works or
what's convenient, as we’ve also seen them attempt to infect the target host with other PoS
malware such as PwnPOS (TSPY_PWNPOS.SMA), and BlackPOS (TSPY_POCARDL.AI).
One of MajikPOS’s striking functionalities is how it can take two parts to operate: the main
component, often called csrss.exe, and conhost.exe, which is in charge of the scraping routine.
Only the main component, csrss.exe, is often deployed; if access to the C&C server is blocked,
then full infection doesn’t occur and the endpoint is left with a similarly-named system file. We
also construe that csrss.exe and conhost.exe are so named as an effort by the MajikPOS’s
author to hide the malware, as they mimic common file names in Microsoft Windows.
Additionally, MajikPOS opts to use uncommon ports as its C&C channel. We’re not certain why,
as the customary approach for malware nowadays is to try blending in within normal user traffic,
and use the more commonly utilized HTTP (TCP port 80), or HTTPS (TCP port 443).
This technical brief provides an in-depth look into MajikPOS’s attack chain and routines.

1

Entry Point and Attack Chain


Unsecure VNC and RDP. While port scanning of hosts directly accessible via the
internet happens all the time (and not all result in a compromise), we observed that
targets are initially identified by having open ports related to VNC (like TCP port 5900)
and RDP (usually TCP port 3389).



Previously installed malicious backdoors, or RATs. Most of the backdoors involved
have the functionality to acquire information from—and provide remote access to—the
endpoint. These RATs can be purchased in the underground, and are otherwise easy to
come by. The MajikPOS-infected endpoints we observed would have one or more of the
following RATs:
o

Remcos (BKDR_SOCMER.SM)

o

SpyGate (BKDR_BLADABI.SMC)

o

Luminosity Link (BKDR_LUMINOSITY.SM1)

o

Xtreme (WORM_XTREME.SMM)

Configuration and C&C Communication
MajikPOS contacts its C&C server to register the infected system, along with the local IP
address, Hardware ID (HWID), Operating System (OS), and computer name. All communication
between client and server is encrypted with AES-ECB with Base64 encoding.

Figure 2: The information after decrypting the C&C communication
The key used in the sample we analyzed
(427f1bf2b91cad1e9a4b7e095d6c83763f1bd50d6b8d515d3dbee9f96ef47097) is:
@#$%^&*()<>,./;'-==oqwertgnhiopl
Once registered, the server replies with a configuration file in this format:
ok<password for update>#<regex for track2>|<regex for track1>#<whitelisted processes>

Figure 3: Server responds with configuration details after registration
The malware then asks the server to update the executable while passing along the HWID and
password—the first data from its configuration. As a result, another file is downloaded from the
server, which is saved and executed in the system as “%WinDir%\conhost.exe”.
Conhost.exe is then executed with encrypted arguments. The malware continues to do a task
request from the server while the downloaded component runs in parallel. As of this time, only
“exeupdate” was executed, but code analysis indicates that it can also delete itself from the
system using the command “deletebot”.

The C&C servers are coded within the malware binary, which utilized both domain names and
IP addresses—the domain names were not employing Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA).

RAM-scraping Routine
Conhost.exe is the component responsible for RAM scraping. It uses information from the
configuration file for this routine—a whitelist of processes to be skipped when scanning for
credit card track data; and regular expressions that verify Track 1 and Track 2 data.
PoS malware typically scan the process memory of PoS software, where the credit card data
are located; they are also stored on the magnetic stripe tracks (1, 2, and 3). A PoS malware
would need to conduct pattern matching on the track data (sometimes only track 2) to identify
the credit card dumps in memory. Track 1 contains the credit card number, expiration date,
service code, and the cardholder’s name, while Track 2 has the credit card number, expiration
date, and service code.
Processes not in the whitelist are first scanned for strings with delimiters, such as ‘=’ and ‘^’ and
beginning with ‘B’ or ‘;’ and ends with ‘?’, to make the routine faster. Depending on the result, it
will further verify if the track data is valid via regex matching:
 Track 1: ([3-6]{1}\d{14,15}\^[a-zA-Z/. ]{0,50}\^\d{12,22})
 Track2: [3-6]{1}\d{14,15}=\d{4}(101|121|126|201|206|220|221|226|521|606|620)\d{5,15}

Figure 10: Regex used to match Track 2 data (visualization by REGEXPER)
Magnetic stripe cards store this information in a format defined by ISO/IEC 7813:2006, where it
is possible to determine the credit card issuer (i.e., Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.)
through the primary account number (PAN), and card type (service code). These ascertain the
card’s restrictions, and where it can be used.
MajikPOS checks the first digit which must be a value from 3 to 6. MajikPOS also checks the
service codes and delimiters “=” or “^” in their proper places. While it uses regular expressions
to match a valid card number, it does not use Luhn algorithm (a checksum formula) to validate
the credit card number.

6

After verifying the track data, the information is sent to the C&C server via HTTP POST,
Action=”bin”:

Figure 11: MajikPOS sends track data via HTTP POST
Delving into the conhost.exe’s code, we found that conhost.exe declares .NET classes
corresponding to the backdoor commands of the malware while communicating to its C&C
server. Interestingly, only the Track and SerializedTracks were used by conhost.exe among
other classes present. The other classes/commands were used by its main component. It
appears conhost.exe is designed as such so the main and RAM-scraping components can be
combined into one module.
Here is a summary of the backdoor commands:

Online Shops for Stolen Credit Card Data
The peddler, who goes by the handle “MAGICDUMPS”, had specific instruction to “work exactly
as instructed after you buy the dumps”. This can possibly refer to the location (city, area code,
and ZIP code) where the card must be used to ensure “the highest percentage of approval rate”.
This can also suggest why the “magic dumps” shop indicates the country, state, city, and ZIP
code. These dumps can also be searched by location.

Here are the domains we found selling credit card data stolen by MajikPOS, based on our
research on one of the malware’s C&C servers. The name “SwipeIT” curiously coincides with
our research on another PoS malware, FastPOS (TSPY_FASTPOS).
