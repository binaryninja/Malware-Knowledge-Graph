All That for a Coinminer?

January 18, 2021

A threat actor recently brute forced a local administrator password using RDP and then
dumped credentials using Mimikatz. They not only dumped LogonPasswords but they also
exported all Kerberos tickets. The threat actor used Advanced IP Scanner to scan the
environment before RDPing into multiple systems, including a Domain Controller. After an
hour of moving around the environment, they deployed XMRig on the initial compromised
system before logging off. The threat actor was active on the network for about 2 hours in
total.

MITRE ATT&CK
Initial Access
The threat actor logged in using RDP from an IP (92.118.13[.]103) that hadn’t attempted any
previous logins. The account was created the previous day using a source IP of
54.38.67[.]132, which had been trying to brute force a local admin password. The threat
actor used a workstation named winstation. During the intrusion, the threat actors also used
5.122.15[.]138 to login to one of the systems.

1/11

Execution
The threat actor copied svshost.exe to C:\naz\naz and then executed it. This PE creates
“XMRig CPU mine.exe” and HideAll.bat in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions and then executes
both of them.

Defense Evasion
The PE file that installs XMRig (svshost.exe) also has a script (HideAll.bat) imbedded in it,
which is called at runtime. This is the contents of that batch file.
attrib +h svshost.exe
attrib +h XMRig CPU mine.exe
attrib +h config.json
attrib +h HideAll.bat
attrib +h xmrig-notls.exe

This script is copied to C:\Windows\PolicyDefitions\ and run, which causes the files specified
to be hidden.

Persistence
Before the threat actor disconnected, they changed the user password.
net user %USERNAME% ehs.123

Credential Access

2/11

Mimikatz was used to dump credentials from memory, as well as, export Kerberos tickets
using the following command:
mimikatz.exe", """log"" ""privilege::debug"" ""sekurlsa::logonpasswords""
""sekurlsa::tickets /export"" ""exit"""

The threat actors used a vbs script named launch to execute mimikatz. This is the content of
launch.vbs
set shell=CreateObject("Shell.Application")
shell.ShellExecute "mimikatz.exe", """log"" ""privilege::debug""
""sekurlsa::logonpasswords"" ""sekurlsa::tickets /export"" ""exit""", "", "runas", 0
set shell=nothing

Since the log parameter was used, the output was saved to mimikatz.log

The Kerberos tickets were saved to disk, due to the threat actor using sekurlsa::tickets
/export.

Discovery
Advanced IP Scanner was used to scan the environment.
3/11

Task manager was opened multiple times. Possibly looking at logged in users and/or
processes.

Net Accounts was used to review user policies.
net accounts

4/11

masscan and masscan gui were dropped but were not executed.

Lateral Movement
RDP was used to move laterally to multiple machines in the environment, which included
domain controllers, backup machines, etc.

Command and Control
RDP was used to access the environment, as well as move within the environment.

Impact
XMRig was running on the system, using some CPU but not enough to cause any issues.
We tend to block mining endpoints, which may have lessened the impact of this intrusion.
XMRig made connection attempts to 104.140.201[.]42 & 104.142.244[.]186.
The threat actors have been using the associated Monero wallet for 738+ days and have
netted around $5,159.

5/11

Was the threat actors’ mission to mine Monero? Or was this a recon mission? Possibly both?
