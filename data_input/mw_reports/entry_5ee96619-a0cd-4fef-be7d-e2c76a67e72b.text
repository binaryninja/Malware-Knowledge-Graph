Most of the world’s population has been under lockdown for more than two weeks, forced to
work from the safety of their own homes.
Many have turned to video-conferencing software to keep businesses open, to attend
classes or just to stay connected. It was just a matter of time until cyber-criminals started to
trick users into installing tainted video-conferencing apps to capitalize on the expanded pool
of users.

Malicious Zoom clones for the unaware
Zoom has been in the spotlight lately as one of the booming applications for video
conferencing, despite its issues with end-to-end encryption and liberalized data sharing with
Facebook. It did not take long for cyber-criminals to re-package it, disseminate it on thirdparty markets and wait for new victims to install it. The samples documented in this article
spread outside of the Google Play Store and exclusively target users who sideload
applications on their Droids.
Analyzed sample: 30a1a22dcf7fa0b62809f510a43829b1
Packagename: us.zoom.videomeetings
Detection: Android.Trojan.Downloader.UJ
App label: Zoom
This piece of malware has components injected in the repackaged Zoom application, as
shown in figure 1 below.

While the user interface is identical with the original application, it comes with extra
“functionality” that the user did not sign up for. The malware tries to download its main
payload from a command-and-control infrastructure
at tcp[:]//googleteamsupport[.]ddns.net:4444
The choice of domains is likely not random, as it could indicate what the attackers might
target next (the Google TeamSupport application is a business-to-business collaborative
platform that is also surging during the COVID-19 isolation).

Update (04/01/2020): We have investigated the googleteamsupport[.]ddns.net domain and
uncovered some interesting historical details.

This is a dynamic DNS service that allows an user with a dynamic IP address to map it to a
subdomain, so they can offer a service without interruption, even when their dynamic IP
address changes.
Our domain history shows that this subdomain was pointed at an IP address in Jordan
(92.253.77.106) that seems to also have resolved sweetman2020[.]no-ip[].biz.

We were able to link the sweetman2020 subdomain as a command and control server for
SandoRAT / DroidJack, an Android remote access tool. Last year, security researcher
Dancho Danchev also linked this subdomain to several targeted attacks using remote
access tools.

The sample has the same package name as the original Zoom application and the
developers have taken even subtle measures to keep the Certificate details as close as
possible to the original Zoom app.

Aggressive adware gangs can’t miss the show
Bitdefender researchers have also uncovered a tainted Zoom APK that specifically targets
Chinese users. Once sideloaded, the application asks for phone, location and photo
permissions on start.
Analyzed sample: fb5243138a920129dd85bb0e1545c2be
Packagename: us.zoom.videomeetings
Detection: Android.Adware.Downloader.BC
4/8

App label: Zoom
Targets: China
When the victim taps the app icon, the application either does nothing, or it briefly displays
an ad before closing itself.
The piece of code below shows that the main activity is transparent:
<activity android:name="com.kdssa.sdk.csj.SplashActivity"
android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"> <intent-filter> <action
android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/> <category
android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/> </intent-filter> </activity>

As soon as the app opens, a native ad is loaded and displayed on the screen for just a
second.

When the application finally starts, the victim is presented with ads as soon as they try to
Join a Meeting. They will keep receiving these ads until they press the X button.
The APK we analyzed retrieves adware info from:
https[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos.pstatp[.]com/obj/ad-pattern/renderer/package.json (the sf3 prefix part
is different across various apps with the same SDK)
{“name”:”ad-pattern-renderer”,”version”:”1.0.124″,”main”:”https[:]//sf3-ttcdntos.pstatp][.]com/obj/ad-pattern/renderer/99093f/index.html”,”resources”:
[{“url”:”https[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos.pstatp[.]com/obj/adpattern/renderer/99093f/index.html”,”md5″:”f0d70a91b5035cd0a11b99fe8182ca42″,”level”:
{“url”:”https[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos.pstatp[.]com/obj/adpattern/renderer/99093f/index.js”,”md5″:”0f4eeff8f4ebfa230471c43dbf2e8bae”,”level”:1}

More Zoom badware
This is another malicious sample that attempts to impersonate the Zoom application and
lure victims into installing it.
Analyzed sample: 9930b683d4b31a3398da0fb75c27d056
Packagename: app.z1_android_421120320_app_original_file
Detection: Android.Trojan.HiddenAds.AJR
App label: ZOOM Cloud Meetings
When opened, the application initially hides itself from the menu. It then starts a repeating
alarm that randomly sends an intent to an Ad Service. This service subsequently starts an
AdActivity that opens an ad. The link can be found in the resources: adsforapp1[.]com

The malicious app proceeds with checking for another hard-coded string in assets, called
‘admin’. If the string is true, it asks for device admin rights. If the value is set to false (as in
our case), it tries to download another file (the apk entry).
When opened, the app redirects to download the extra component.

6/8

As of the moment of writing, this sample has been seen in the wild in the United States.
The sample bundles functionality to ask for device admin permissions in English or
Russian, based on the default language of the mobile phone. The malware also has the
ability to start itself when the device is powered on.
Bitdefender Mobile Security for Android detects and blocks these applications as
Android.Trojan.Downloader.UJ, Android.Adware.Downloader.BC and
Android.Trojan.HiddenAds.AJR. In order to minimize risks of getting compromised, Android

7/8

users are advised to install a security solution and to limit their downloads to vendorrecommended application stores.
