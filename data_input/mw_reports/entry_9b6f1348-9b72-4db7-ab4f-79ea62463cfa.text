The TrickBot and MikroTik Connection – A Story of
Investment and Collaboration

Wicus Ross Lead Security Researcher, SecureData Labs
In my professional capacity I perform several tasks. One involves tracking and collecting
indicators of compromise (IoC) used to identify malware campaigns. Another involves
tracking incidents reported in mainstream media, establishing trends, and distilling the
information into actionable items for clients and colleagues. The fun part of my job involves
writing tools or playing with those authored by others.
This is a story where all these aspects neatly intersect. It’s also a story which highlights the
need for security companies to invest in their staff, and to encourage creativity to build a
safer online environment for businesses and consumers.
Tracking TrickBot
Security companies across the globe track malware campaigns, including one named
TrickBot. TrickBot monitors the web surfing activity of its victim, and activate when certain
websites, such as internet banking, are accessed. It then attempts to capture account details
of its victim when he or she browses to a login URL that is being monitored.

If we look at industry trends, this one is definitely a contender on the top ten offender list.
Among the others are those which target unsecured IoT devices, subverting them into what
is called a botnet – the likes of Mirai, Satori, VPNFilter, and Slingshot. The latter two have
been linked to APT or nation state actors, Mirai and VPNFilter have been associated with
distributed denial of service attacks, while Slingshot was reportedly used to pivot into internal
networks. So, a pretty bad bunch!
We’ve noticed, in our own tracking of botnets, the increasing involvement of MikroTik
devices, and also noted vulnerable MikroTik routers, through publicly disclosed vulnerabilities
that were attributed to others. This, coupled with poor vulnerability management, has meant
an increase in the number of compromised MikroTik hosts.
Where internal investment plays its part
On to the fun part. Our team takes a creative approach to cybersecurity and they’re
constantly expanding their capabilities, building tools not only because they have to, but out
of curiosity.
Enter my esteemed colleague, Willem. A few weeks ago, Willem saw that Pastebin was
running a lifetime Pro subscription promotion. Willem signed up, and a couple of hours later
had created Pastebot, a Pastebin scraper that hooked into cloud-based collaboration
platform, Slack. It was not long before Pastebot started spamming our SD Labs’ Slack
workspace with all kinds of nasties found on Pastebin.
Fast forward to one Monday morning just before lunch. I received a Slack message from
Willem with a link to a Pastebin post that hosted XML config for a TrickBot campaign. This
was picked up by Pastebot because Willem was looking for Pastebin posts that contain
names of certain well-established financial institutions. This returned a TrickBot XML file
containing 38 IP addresses and port pairs across the world.
Next, a quick spot check using Shodan, which provided us with a sense of what we were
dealing with: several were associated with MikroTik routers. We verified this and the result
was surprising. Of the 38 IPs, Shodan returned info on 37 hosts, 19 of which were identified
as MikroTik routers. This suggests that either the routers or the hosts behind them had been
compromised – or both.
One of the MikroTik routers reported the latest version of firmware which had been fully
patched against known exploits. All the 19 MikroTik routers had their bandwidth test services
exposed to the internet, and 18 had default SSH ports exposed to the internet.
Tools and tactics
We passed MikroTik router IPs through IOCParlor (a tool created by our team that helps
automate IOC collection and verification) to get a sense of how naughty these hosts really
are. IOCParlor queried VirusTotal and returned a list of 14 IPs flagged as malicious.

To verify the results, we picked one IP and manually reviewed it using the VirusTotal web
client, which produced an MS Word document.
Of the 61 malware engines that scanned the document, 35 reported it as malicious. Several
of the malware engines classified the document as a trojan downloader, meaning that when
Word opens the file it will download malware.
The community tab associated with the VirusTotal report had several comments, including
one from by dvk01 of My Online Security, a phishing and malware campaign reporting site
that the SD Labs team regularly uses. dvk01 labelled the malware as TrickBot and links to an
article that describes how the same contagion was used for a malicious Bank of America
email.
In September 2018, there were reports in the industry that highlighted the increasing number
of MikroTik routers that are ensnared in malicious activity. What was interesting was that
TrickBot is using C2 hosts that have MikroTik routers involved.
Had the SD Labs not been tinkering with cybersecurity tools, this discovery may not have
been made. Leveraging seemingly unrelated events and tying them together with other
analysis demonstrates the need to not only examine obscure incidents across the industry,
but also the kind of tactics needed to protect organizations against threats that could never
have been imagined.
Continued investment in research and tooling is needed across industry, coupled with a
creative approach and some outside-the-box thinking.
