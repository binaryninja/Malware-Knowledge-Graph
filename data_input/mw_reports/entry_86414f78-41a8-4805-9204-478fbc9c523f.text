Lazarus Targets Chemical Sector
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/lazarus-dream-job-chemical

Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software, has observed the North Korea-linked advanced
persistent threat (APT) group known as Lazarus conducting an espionage campaign targeting
organizations operating within the chemical sector. The campaign appears to be a
continuation of Lazarus activity dubbed Operation Dream Job, which was first observed in
August 2020. Symantec tracks this sub-set of Lazarus activity under the name Pompilus.

Operation Dream Job
Operation Dream Job involves Lazarus using fake job offers as a means of luring victims into
clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments that eventually lead to the
installation of malware used for espionage.
Past Dream Job campaigns have targeted individuals in the defense, government, and
engineering sectors in activity observed in August 2020 and July 2021.

Recently targeted sectors
In January 2022, Symantec detected attack activity on the networks of a number of
organizations based in South Korea. The organizations were mainly in the chemical sector,
with some being in the information technology (IT) sector. However, it is likely the IT targets
were used as a means to gain access to chemical sector organizations.

There is sufficient evidence to suggest that this recent activity is a continuation of Operation
Dream Job. That evidence includes file hashes, file names, and tools that were observed in
previous Dream Job campaigns.
A typical attack begins when a malicious HTM file is received, likely as a malicious link in an
email or downloaded from the web. The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called
scskapplink.dll and injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web
EX Client.
The scskapplink.dll file is typically a signed Trojanized tool with malicious exports added.
The attackers have been observed using the following signatures: DOCTER USA, INC and "A"
MEDICAL OFFICE, PLLC
Next, scskapplink.dll downloads and executes an additional payload from a command-andcontrol (C&C) server with the URL parameter key/values "prd_fld=racket".
This step kicks off a chain of shellcode loaders that download and execute arbitrary
commands from the attackers, as well as additional malware, which are usually executed
from malicious exports added to Trojanized tools such as the Tukaani project LZMA Utils
library (XZ Utils).
The attackers move laterally on the network using Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) and inject into MagicLine by DreamSecurity on other machines.
In some instances, the attackers were spotted dumping credentials from the registry,
installing a BAT file in a likely effort to gain persistence, and using a scheduled task
configured to run as a specific user.
The attackers were also observed deploying post-compromise tools, including a tool used to
take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine at set intervals
(SiteShoter). They were also seen using an IP logging tool (IP Logger), a protocol used to turn
computers on remotely (WakeOnLAN), a file and directory copier (FastCopy), and the File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) executed under the MagicLine process.

Case study
The following is a case study detailing step-by-step attacker activity on an organization in the
chemical sector.
January 17, 2022
00:51 – A malicious HTM file is received:
e31af5131a095fbc884c56068e19b0c98636d95f93c257a0c829ec3f3cc8e4ba csidl_profile\appdata\local\microsoft\windows\inetcache\ie\3tygrjkm\join_06[1].htm

2/8

The HTM file is copied to a DLL file:
rundll32.exe CSIDL_PROFILE\public\scskapplink.dll,netsetcookie Cnusrmgr
This DLL file is injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX
Client. The file is a signed Trojanized version of the ComparePlus plugin for Notepad++ with
malicious exports added.
01:02 – The file is run and downloads and executes a backdoor payload (final.cpl 5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) from a
command-and-control (C&C) server with the URL parameter key/values "prd_fld=racket".
The file final.cpl is a Trojanized version of the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils)
with a malicious export added (AppMgmt).
The malware connects to, downloads, decodes, and executes shellcode from the following
remote location:
hxxp[:]//happy[.]nanoace.co.kr/Content/rating/themes/krajeefas/FrmAMEISMngWeb.asp
01:04 – Another CPL file
(61e305d6325b1ffb6de329f1eb5b3a6bcafa26c856861a8200d717df0dec48c4) is executed.
This file, again, is a Trojanized version of LZMA Utils with a malicious added export.
01:13 – The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed again several times.
01:38 – Commands are executed to dump credentials from the SAM and SYSTEM registry
hives.
Over the next several hours, the attackers run unknown shellcode via final.cpl at various
intervals, likely to collect the dumped system hives, among other things.
06:41 – The attackers create a scheduled task to ensure persistence between system reboots:
schtasks /create /RU [REDACTED].help\175287 /ST 15:42 /TR "cmd.exe /c
C:\ProgramData\Intel\Intel.bat" /tn arm /sc MINUTE
The scheduled task instructs the system to execute 'Intel.bat' as user
‘[REDACTED].help/175287’ starting at 15:42 then every minute under the scheduled task
name ‘arm’. It's unclear if this was an account that was cracked via the dumped registry hives
or an account the attackers were able to create with admin rights.
The attackers were also observed installing Cryptodome (PyCrypto fork) Python encryption
modules via CPL files.

3/8

A clean installation of BitDefender was also installed by the attackers. While unconfirmed,
the threat actors may have installed an older version of this software (from 2020) with a
vulnerability that allowed attackers to run arbitrary commands remotely.
January 18
00:21 – The final.cpl file is executed again.
00:49 – A new CPL file called wpm.cpl
(942489ce7dce87f7888322a0e56b5e3c3b0130e11f57b3879fbefc48351a78f6) is executed.
CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\finaldata\wpm.cpl Thumbs.ini 4 30
This file contains, and connects to, a list of IP addresses and records whether the connections
were successful.
01:11 – Again, the final.cpl shellcode loader is executed multiple times, executing some
unknown shellcode. This activity continued intermittently until 23:49.
23:49 – The file name of the CPL file changes to 'ntuser.dat'. The file location and
command-line arguments remain the same.
January 19
00:24 – The CPL shellcode loader files (final.cpl and ntuser.dat) are executed multiple
times.
00:28 – The attackers create a scheduled task on another machine, likely to ensure
persistence:
schtasks /create /RU [REDACTED]\i21076 /ST 09:28 /TR "cmd.exe /c
C:\ProgramData\Adobe\arm.bat" /tn arm /sc MINUTE
The command is used to schedule a task named 'arm' to run the file 'arm.bat' starting at at
09:28 then every minute after that under the user account '[REDACTED]\i21076'.
00:29 – A file named arm.dat
(48f3ead8477f3ef16da6b74dadc89661a231c82b96f3574c6b7ceb9c03468291) is executed
with the following command line arguments:
CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe
CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\adobe\arm.dat,packageautoupdater
LimitedSpatialExtent_U_f48182 -d 1440 -i 10 -q 8 -s 5
The arm.dat file is a tool used to take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised
machine every 10 seconds (SiteShoter), as determined by the command line arguments. The
screenshots are saved in appdata\local with the date at the top of the file.
4/8

06:50 – The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed several times.
07:34 – A new CPL file named addins.cpl
(5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) is executed
multiple times, which again is another shellcode loader and has the same command line
arguments as seen with final.cpl:
CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\addins.cpl, AppMgmt
EO6-CRY-LS2-TRK3
07:39 – A scheduled task is created:
sc create uso start= auto binPath= “cmd.exe /c start /b C:\Programdata\addins.bat”
DisplayName= uso
The task is used to auto-start and execute addins.bat each time the system is booted. The task
uses the service name 'uso' (a file name previously used in older Dream Job campaigns
targeting security researchers).
The attacker runs addins.cpl again to run a command to start the service and then delete the
service directly after:
CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\addins.cpl, AppMgmt
EO6-CRY-LS2-TRK3
sc start uso (via cmd.exe)
sc delete uso
The following commands were then executed to collect information pertaining to network
configuration, current user the attackers are logged in as, active users on the machine,
available shared drives, and the contents of the 'addins' directory.
ipconfig /all
whoami
query user
net use
dir CSIDL_WINDOWS\addins
07:41 – The file addins.cpl is executed again multiple times before a scheduled task is
created to run addins.bat again, start the service, and immediately delete the service:
sc create uso start= auto binPath= "cmd.exe /c start /b
C:\Windows\addins\addins.bat" DisplayName= uso
sc start uso
sc delete uso
January 20
5/8

The attackers execute addins.cpl again with the same command line as before.
No further activity is observed.
The Lazarus group is likely targeting organizations in the chemical sector to obtain
intellectual property to further North Korea’s own pursuits in this area. The group’s
continuation of Operation Dream Job, as witnessed by Symantec and others, suggests that
the operation is sufficiently successful. As such, organizations should ensure they have
adequate security in place and remain vigilant for attacks such as this.
As always, users should be wary of clicking links or downloading files even if they come from
seemingly trustworthy sources.
