Identiﬁcation of a new cyber criminal group: Lockean

1 Context: links between several incidents within the
French remit
Over the 2020-2021 period, the following compromises of French companies’ information system (IS) by the QakBot
malware have been reported to the ANSSI:
• Compromise of a French company in the manufacturing sector in June 2020, which will subsequently be
called “Company A”;
• Compromise of the transport company Gefco in September 2020 [1];
• Compromise of the Ouest-France newspaper in November 2020 [2];
• Compromise of the pharmaceutical group Fareva in mid-December 2020 [3];
• Compromise of a French services company in February 2021, which will subsequently be called “Company
B”;
• Compromise of the pharmaceutical company Pierre Fabre at the end of March 2021 [4].
In addition to the constant presence of QakBot as the ﬁrst payload, some incidents had other similarities:
• in four incidents (Company A, Gefco, Fareva, Pierre Fabre) 1 , the QakBot payload naming convention was
the same;
• in ﬁve incidents (Gefco, Fareva, Pierre Fabre, Ouest-France, Company B), the use of Cobalt Strike was observed;
• in four incidents among these (Gefco, Fareva, Pierre Fabre, Company B) 2 , the domain names of the command and control servers (C2) associated with Cobalt Strike had the same naming convention: they spoofed
Akamai domains 3 and Azure domains 4 . This infrastructure is referred to as the Akamai/Azure Cluster in the
remainder of the document;
• in three incidents (Gefco, Ouest-France, Pierre Fabre) 5 , the exﬁltration tool Rclone 6 was used with the same
naming convention for the executable and its conﬁguration ﬁle, based on the spooﬁng of the “svchost” Windows service.
In addition, two open source reports describe infection chains with the same characteristics: one from the IT
security ﬁrm Intrinsec concerning the ProLock and Egregor [5] ransomware and the other from The DFIR Report
regarding the Sodinokibi [6] ransomware.

1. The naming convention used during the Ouest-France and Company B incidents is not known to the ANSSI or to the victims.
2. The Cobalt Strike implant infrastructure discovered at Ouest-France is neither known to the ANSSI nor to the victims.
3. Akamai Technologies is an American company specialising in the provision of cache servers for businesses.
4. Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud services platform.
5. The exﬁltration tool that may have been used during incidents A, B and Fareva is not known to the ANSSI or the victims.
6. Rclone is an open-source command line tool used to manage or migrate content on cloud services.

Identiﬁcation of a new cyber criminal group: Lockean

Fig. 1.1 – Links between several incidents and IT security ﬁrm reports
In view of these commonalities, the same group of attackers could be behind the six incidents reported to
the ANSSI and be the subject of the reports by Intrinsec and The DFIR Report.
In addition, given that:
• the incidents at Gefco and Ouest-France resulted in the spread of the Egregor ransomware 7 ,
• the incident at Pierre Fabre and the incident described by The DFIR Report resulted in the spread of the
Sodinokibi ransomware 8 ,
• the incidents at Company A and Fareva resulted in the spread of the DoppelPaymer ransomware 9 ,
• the incident described by Intrinsec resulted in the spread of the ProLock ransomware 10 ,
• all of these ransomware programs operate according to the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model,
this group is thought to have been affiliated since it was ﬁrst observed in June 2020 with several RaaS, including Egregor, Sodinokibi, DoppelPaymer and ProLock.

7. Egregor is RaaS that appeared at the start of the second half of 2020 and is supposedly operated by the cyber criminal group behind its
predecessor: Maze. Egregor was taken down in February 2021 by a police operation.
8. Emerging in 2019, Sodinokibi (aka REvil) is RaaS operated by the cyber criminal group Pinchy Spider. A victim data disclosure site is
associated with this ransomware.
9. DoppelPaymer is ransomware from the BitPaymer family and is operated by the cyber criminal group Doppel Spider. It is thought to
have become RaaS from 2020. A victim data disclosure site has been associated with this ransomware since February 2020.
10. ProLock is ransomware that appeared in early 2020 and disappeared in the third quarter of the same year.

2 Investigations into and discovery of the Lockean cyber
criminal group
Based on these incidents and their commonalities, investigations were carried out by the ANSSI to conﬁrm the
existence of this cyber criminal group, understand its modus operandi and distinguish its main Techniques, Tactics
and Procedures (TTPs).
Comment: The ANSSI is not aware of any previous work technically linking all of these malicious activities and associating
them with the same group of attackers.

2.1 Investigation into the Cobalt Strike C2 infrastructure involved
The table below lists the infrastructure observed in several of the incidents in which Cobalt Strike has been used.
Several domain names of the C2 servers spoof Akamai and Azure domains. In addition, the term « technology »
(and its derivatives) is regularly found in the domains and the same domain name is sometimes reused by deriving
its Top Level Domain (TLD).

Several of these C2 servers use the naming convention spooﬁng Akamai and Azure observed in the incidents studied:
• « akastat.space »
• « azurestat.app »
• « akamaclouds.tech »
• « akabox.space »
• « akabox.tech »
• « akamalupdate.site »
• « azuresecure.tech »

Note that the domain name « akamalupdate.site », which shares common headers with the C2 server « smalleststores.com »
observed by The DFIR Report, corresponds to the Akamai/Azure naming convention. This constitutes a technical
infrastructure link between the incident described by The DFIR Report and those observed by the ANSSI.
The domain names that do not use the Akamai/Azure naming convention are not strongly linked to this cluster, as
the header similarities alone do not seem to be a sufficient element to technically group them together.

All of the domain names observed in the incidents, as well as those resulting from the pivots, were purchased from
the Namecheap registrar. They also all use exotic, often inexpensive TLDs.
Two types of TLS certiﬁcates have been observed on the C2 servers: the Cobalt Strike certiﬁcate, which by default
is SHA-1 « 6ece5ece4192683d2d84e25b0ba7e04f9cb7eb7c », and certiﬁcates issued by Let’s Encrypt.
The C2 servers are mostly hosted by HostWinds and LeaseWeb in the United States.

The QakBot 11 implants involved in the incidents reported to the ANSSI, as well as in those described in the report
by the IT security ﬁrm Intrinsec [5], use the following naming convention: « md.* ».
Following the observation of this convention, pivots on code analysis platforms made it possible to identify QakBot
implants named « md.exe » and « md.dll », as well as others sharing the same botnet conﬁguration parameter. The
conﬁgurations of the implants were then extracted:

The implants found in the incidents handled by the ANSSI from which the conﬁguration was able to be extracted
are all linked to the same QakBot affiliate, located via the root of the “botnet” ﬁeld of the conﬁguration: « domain ».
All additional implants named « md.exe » and « md.dll », found via pivots, are also linked to the QakBot « domain »
affiliate, which conﬁrms the effectiveness of the search method based on the observed naming convention.

However, on several occasions, Cobalt Strike implants communicating with the Akamai/Azure cluster were registered, not by the QakBot « domain » affiliate but by the QakBot « Obama » affiliate:
• « obama35 » botnet: C2 « azuresecure.tech » [8, 9]
• « obama41 » botnet: C2 « akabox.tech » [10]
• « obama? » botnet: C2 « akastat.app » [11]

11. Emerging in 2009, QakBot (aka Qbot, Pinkslipbot) is a modular Trojan horse used to distribute other payloads, especially ransomware.
In 2020, QakBot distributed the ProLock, Egregor and DoppelPaymer ransomware. In 2021, given the incident at Pierre Fabre, it appears that
QakBot can also distribute Sodinokibi. QakBot operates under an affiliate model [7].

Identiﬁcation of a new cyber criminal group: Lockean

Three hypotheses can explain this observation:
• the « Obama » ID is linked to the « domain » ID;
• the Cobalt Strike Akamai/Azure infrastructure cluster is used by several groups of attackers and is therefore
potentially provided by a third-party cyber criminal;
• the Cobalt Strike Akamai/Azure infrastructure is provided directly to some of its affiliates by Mallard Spider
(aka Gold Lagoon), the cyber criminal group that developed and makes available QakBot.
Comment: The ANSSI cannot draw any conclusions for the moment. However, QakBot distributed Cobalt Strike implants using C2 servers that are not part of the Akamai/Azure cluster, on multiple occasions [12, 13]. As such, this third
hypothesis can reasonably be set aside.

2.3 Investigation into the use of the Rclone exﬁltration tool
In ﬁve incidents, the Rclone executable, as well as its conﬁguration ﬁle, had the same name, spooﬁng the Windows
service « svchost ».

The ProLock incident described by the IT security ﬁrm Intrinsec is somewhat unique, as there is no direct reference to « svchost.exe », or to the servers used for exﬁltration. However, Group-IB indicates that in the ProLock
incidents, the Rclone executable was always renamed to look like legitimate system binaries [14]. It is therefore
conceivable that this is also named « svchost.exe ».
The use of Rclone and the names of its ﬁles are not the only commonalities between the different incidents, given
that there are also similarities regarding the exﬁltration infrastructures used:
• The FTP exﬁltration servers observed in the Gefco and Ouest-France incidents had similar self-signed TLS
certiﬁcates (value « Kanzas City » used in the subject), in addition to having an identical version of vsFTPd.
• The WebDAV exﬁltration servers observed in the incident addressed by The DFIR Report [6], as well as in
the Gefco and Ouest-France incidents, had the same HTTP banners, notably the basic authentication named
« realm_name ». This does not appear to be a known default conﬁguration. Additionally, in the case of The
DFIR Report and Gefco, the HTTP servers both exposed a self-signed certiﬁcate generated with OpenSSL.
Pivots made from these conﬁguration elements made it possible to identify other exﬁltration servers potentially
used by the same group of attackers:

2.4 Conclusion following the investigations
According to the ANSSI’s investigations, there is indeed a cyber criminal group responsible for the attacks on Gefco,
Company A, Company B, Pierre Fabre, Ouest France, Fareva and those reported by the IT security ﬁrms Intrinsec
and The DFIR Report.
This group is characterised by the following main TTPs:
• the use of Cobalt Strike;
• the use of a Cobalt Strike C2 server naming convention spooﬁng Akamai and Azure domain names;
• the frequent use of the term « technology » and its derivatives in its domain names;
• the purchase of domain names from NameCheap;
• the use of exotic TLDs;
• the use of the default TLS certiﬁcate of Cobalt Strike and Let’s Encrypt certiﬁcates;
• the hosting of its C2 servers with HostWinds and LeaseWeb;
• the use of QakBot as the ﬁrst payload;
• the application of the “md” naming convention to the QakBot implants;
• its connection to the « domain » affiliate of QakBot, active since June 2020;
• the use of the Rclone exﬁltration tool;
• the application of the “svchost” naming convention to the Rclone executable;
• exﬁltration via FTP and WebDAV.
It will now be called “Lockean”, based on the WebDAV username used for data exﬁltration in the Egregor incident
at Ouest France.

3 Infection chain associated with Lockean
3.1 Infection vector
3.1.1 Phishing emails distributed by a distribution service
In view of the incidents in which it is involved, Lockean allegedly used the Emotet distribution service in 2020 [2,
5], as well as that of TA551 in 2020 and 2021 [15, 16, 7, 17, 18], to distribute QakBot via phishing emails:
• During the Egregor ransomware attack at Ouest-France [2], the ﬁrst payload would indeed have been the
malicious code Emotet 12 . Emotet having been generally distributed in phishing emails, via Epoch botnets
operated by its developers TA542 [20], it is likely that this infection vector initiated the compromise of OuestFrance. The involvement of theEmotet distribution service is conﬁrmed by the report by the IT security
ﬁrm Intrinsec [5], which describes an infection chain relating to Lockean and also involving it upstream,
although its outcome was not to distribute the Egregor ransomware, as with Ouest-France, but to distribute
the ProLock ransomware.
• While TA542 seems to have ceased its activities following the dismantling of Emotet at the start of 2021,
another distribution service, then less well-known, appears to have been favoured by the cyber criminal group
Lockean [6]. This distribution service is that of TA551 (aka Shathak, UNC2420, Gold Cabin) 13 .
However, Lockean would not be the only QakBot affiliate to use these distribution services [7, 26]. As such, currently, any infection with TA551 aimed at distributing QakBot is not sufficient to presume a compromise by Lockean.

3.1.2 Intermediary loaders
In the incidents that the ANSSI links to the Lockean cyber criminal group, the initial access to the IS was achieved
using the QakBot loader, with the exception of the incident described by The DFIR report, in which the IcedID
loader was distributed as the ﬁrst payload 14 .
The fact that there was only one hour between the distribution of IcedID and Cobalt Strike during the incident
analysed by The DFIR Report [6] indicates that it is likely there was a single attacker, a user common to the loader
and the ransomware (in this case, Sodinokibi), rather than two attackers.
Lockean is nevertheless not thought to be the only common affiliate of QakBot and IcedID [7].

3.2 Lateral movement
During the lateral movement phase of the various incidents, four tools were observed: Cobalt Strike, Adﬁnd,
BloodHound and BITSadmin. Frequent use of Cobalt Strike, Adﬁnd and BITSadmin was observed, while BloodHound seems less used.

12. This code, operated by the cyber criminal group TA542, was, from 2017 until it was dismantled in January 2021 [19], a malware loader
for clients.
13. Active since 2018, it involves distributing malware on behalf of clients through massive phishing email campaigns [21, 17, 22, 15, 23, 24].
These emails are characterised by the fact that they often respond to legitimate discussion threads (email thread hijacking), that they usually
contain an attachment in Zip format, sometimes protected by a password provided in the email, that this Zip ﬁle contains a booby-trapped Word
or Excel ﬁle and that this Word or Excel ﬁle uses a DocuSign template generated by the tool EtterSilent [25, 16].
14. In the incident covered by The DFIR Report [6], IcedID seems to have been distributed by EtterSilent [27], which could conﬁrm that
Lockean also used the services of TA551 to distribute IcedID (although TA551 is not the only cyber criminal group to use the EtterSilent tool).

3.3 Exﬁltration
Before encryption, Lockean exﬁltrates its victims’ data using the Rclone tool, which it renames by spooﬁng the
name of the Windows service “svchost”.

3.4 Encryption
The ANSSI’s investigations have identiﬁed several ransomware (RaaS) programs with which Lockean has been
affiliated.

3.4.1 Maze, Egregor and ProLock
During the two Egregor incidents at Gefco [1] and Ouest-France [2] attributed to Lockean by the ANSSI, the IP
address « 185.238.0.233 » was used by the attackers to distribute scripts, as well as ransomware strains.

Strains of the Maze 15 ransomware have also been distributed from this IP address:

15. Maze is RaaS that emerged in May 2019 and disappeared in August 2020. It is known in particular for having introduced the principle of
double extortion in September 2019, in other words exﬁltration of victims’ data and the threat of disclosure on a site in.onion if the ransom is
not paid. Egregor is seen as the RaaS successor of Maze [29].

e95053d1eac4d0e48cdf1b633b12999f

As such, Lockean has been affiliated with the three RaaS Maze, Egregor and ProLock.

3.4.2 DoppelPaymer
Lockean may also have been a DoppelPaymer affiliate for the following reasons:
• strains of the DoppelPaymer ransomware were also distributed from the aforementioned IP address, according to a code analysis platform:
URL

MD5

http://185.238.0.233/88/k057.exe

44a7085f729b68073b5c67bbc66829cc

http://185.238.0.233/k071sm.exe

3a059ab3cbc168987613c137e7a916a9

Note that in the DoppelPaymer incident at Fareva, the ransomware strain was named « k166sm.exe ».
This name matches the naming convention used for the DoppelPaymer strains hosted on the IP address
« 185.238.0.233 ». As such, it is possible that it was involved in the incident at Fareva, although this cannot
be conﬁrmed due to a lack of sufficient information about this incident, in which the ANSSI was not involved;
• Akamai typosquatting Cobalt Strike C2s (« atakai-technologies.host », « akamai-technologies.site »
and « akamai-technologies.space ») were found in incidents leading to encryption by DoppelPaymer [30,
31], thereby supplementing the ANSSI’s observations about the DoppelPaymer incidents at Company A and
Fareva;
• DoppelPaymer was already distributed by QakBot (irrespective of whether it was distributed upstream by
Emotet) [32];
• the renaming of QakBot as « md.exe », speciﬁc to the « domain » affiliate and therefore to Lockean, was found
during the DoppelPaymer incident at Company A in June 2020.

3.4.3 Sodinokibi
On 31 March 2021, the ANSSI was alerted to the encryption of the company Pierre Fabre. During this attack, the
« domain02 » affiliate of QakBot distributed Cobalt Strike (one of the Akamai typosquatting C2s), Rclone (ﬁle
renamed « svchost.exe ») and the Sodinokibi ransomware. Based on common infrastructure links and TTPs,
the ANSSI deduced that Lockean was behind the compromise of Pierre Fabre’s IS, as well as the infection chain
described by The DFIR Report [6].

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE
Identiﬁcation of a new cyber criminal group: Lockean

Fig. 3.1 – Known Lockean activity compared to the ransomware activity period

Lockean would have used:
• DoppelPaymer: since at least June 2020;
• Egregor: since its appearance in September 2020 [1]. By inference, the fact that Lockean may have used Maze
and that Egregor took over from Maze in September 2020 after its discontinuation suggests that Lockean
transferred its affiliation from Maze to Egregor, as intended by the developers of Maze [29]. However, it is
not known to the ANSSI when Lockean began using Maze;
• Sodinokibi: since at least March 2021 [4, 6];
• ProLock: the period of use of this ransomware by Lockean is not identiﬁed, although it may have been
concurrent with that of Egregor [5].
Comment: The ﬁnal shutdown of Maze around November 2020 and the dismantling of Egregor in February 2021 may
have prompted Lockean to turn to the direct competitor of Maze, namely Sodinokibi. The inactivity of Sodinokibi
from 13 July 2021 until early September could have prompted Lockean to temporarily replace it with another RaaS. In
addition, as the RaaS Grief 16 supposedly took over from DoppelPaymer [33], it is possible that Lockean will use Grief
in the future.

3.5 Double extortion principle
The constant exﬁltration of the victim’s data before encryption and the existence of disclosure sites associated with
the RaaS with which Lockean is affiliated (with the exception of ProLock) conﬁrm that this cyber criminal group
is a follower of the double extortion principle, in other words that it exﬁltrates its victims’ data and threatens to
disclose it, to get them to pay the ransom, after encryption.
If the ransom is paid, Lockean only keeps an average of 70%, the remainder going to the developers of the RaaS
16. Emerging at the end of May 2021, Grief (aka Pay, Deuil ransomware) is deemed to be the successor to DoppelPaymer and therefore to be
operated by the same attackers. There are in fact no more publications of victims on the disclosure site associated with DoppelPaymer since
early May 2021 and the ﬁrst sample of Grief discovered pointed to the latter [33].

4 Conclusion
Lockean’s targeting is opportunistic and dependent on the distribution services it employs (Emotet, TA551).
Nevertheless, Lockean has a propensity to target French entities under a Big Game Hunting 17 [1, 4, 2] rationale and therefore represents a threat to watch out for.
Comment: Interestingly, despite being affiliated with ransomware that precludes targeting of entities located in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, Lockean attacked the French transport company Gefco in 2020, even
though Gefco is 75% owned by Russian Railways. Therefore, it is possible that Lockean was not aware of violating the
”rules of engagement” - widely respected- for ransomware it uses.

Fig. 4.1 – OpenCTI illustration of the Lockean attacker group

17. Big Game Hunting involves – for cyber criminal groups with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial resources and technical skills – focusing on targeting
particular companies and institutions in their ransomware attacks. This targeting is characterised in particular by advance preparation for
extortion operations, sometimes several months ahead of time.
