Wednesday, June 24, 2020 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
The following analysis was compiled and published to Threat Intelligence clients in April
2019. The Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team is publicly sharing
insights about BRONZE VINEWOOD and its use of the HanaLoader malware and
DropboxAES RAT to increase visibility of the threat group’s activities.

1/10

Summary
BRONZE VINEWOOD (also known as APT31 and ZIRCONIUM) is a targeted threat group
that has been active since at least June 2016. There has been limited public information
about the group, other than a February 2019 report describing attacks against Norwegian
software provider Visma and multiple U.S. companies. However, that report misattributes the
activity to BRONZE RIVERSIDE (also known as APT10). Secureworks® Counter Threat
Unit™ (CTU) researchers assess that the group is likely based in the People’s Republic of
China (PRC). The threat actors have used a range of tools and techniques to target
organizations that provide legal, consulting, and software development services. CTU™
analysis suggests that organizations that are part of government or defense supply chains or
that provide services to organizations in those verticals may be of interest to BRONZE
VINEWOOD.
CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections:
strategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to
determine how to reduce risk to their organization’s mission and critical assets. Computer
network defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response
investigations and research to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the
threat group’s activities.

Key points
BRONZE VINEWOOD is a PRC-based threat group that has targeted data across a
wide range of organizations. The breadth of this targeting suggests that the group
collects intelligence against a diverse set of requirements.
Attacks on software providers and other supply chain organizations were likely
intended to access customers’ data or networks. Other China-based threat groups
such as BRONZE ATLAS (also known as BARIUM) and BRONZE RIVERSIDE (also
known as APT 10) also compromise supply chains to reach their intended targets.
BRONZE VINEWOOD employs a variety of tools and techniques to gain access to
target environments. Its use of public code or file-sharing websites for its command and
control (C2) domains can complicate network-based detection because the C2 traffic is
interspersed amid legitimate web browsing activity.

Strategic threat intelligence
Analysis of a threat group’s targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which
organizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic
defensive decisions regarding this threat.

Intent
2/10

BRONZE VINEWOOD compromises organizations that might have information of value to
the PRC. The threat group’s intelligence gathering requirements appear to include
intellectual property, information that provides a commercial advantage, and details about
government and defense targets. The BRONZE VINEWOOD activity observed by CTU
researchers has affected organizations in the U.S. and Europe.

Attribution
The attribution of BRONZE VINEWOOD to the PRC is based on an aggregation of multiple
factors:
The information and organizations targeted by BRONZE VINEWOOD, particularly the
emphasis on organizations that provide services to defense or government
organizations, align with Chinese government interests.
The threat actors use techniques that are most commonly associated with Chinese
espionage groups such as BRONZE RIVERSIDE, BRONZE UNION, and BRONZE
HUNTLEY (also known as Tonto Team).

Capability
BRONZE VINEWOOD has deployed a variety of tools across different incidents, and
reported use of a zero-day exploit for the CVE-2017-0005 privilege escalation vulnerability
demonstrates technical proficiency. CTU researchers assess that the threat group’s use of
available or modified open-source tools is to avoid attribution or avoid wasting development
resources. The decision to use open-source tools is an increasingly common trend among
sophisticated threat actors and is often not driven by technical or resource limitations. The
threat actors also leverage popular code and file-sharing sites for their C2 domains. This
relatively uncommon technique makes detection within a busy corporate environment
challenging and suggests technical proficiency and an awareness of operational security and
tradecraft.

Tactical threat intelligence
Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the threat group’s
tools and tactics.

Tools
CTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders have observed BRONZE
VINEWOOD using the following tools:

3/10

Mimikatz — This ubiquitous credential-theft tool is used by a wide range of threat
actors and security testers.
HanaLoader (also known as FANNYPACK) — This downloader is executed using DLL
search order hijacking and attempts to retrieve and run a payload over HTTPS. CTU
analysis suggests that HanaLoader is used to launch a small number of payloads,
including a remote access trojan (RAT) that was named HanaGift based on a string in
the file’s application manifest. HanaGift may also be referred to as HanaRAT.
Meterpreter — This extensible payload is part of the publicly available and widely used
Metasploit Framework.
Trochilus — This RAT was first identified in 2015 and has been implicated in various
attacks against organizations in Myanmar and Thailand. The source code is available
from public code-sharing sites and was the basis for the RedLeaves RAT used by
BRONZE RIVERSIDE. BRONZE VINEWOOD uses a modified version of Trochilus that
supplements the default RC4 encryption with Salsa20 encryption and is launched via
DLL search order hijacking.
DropboxAES RAT — This simple RAT uses Dropbox for command and control, relies
on ChaCha20 to encrypt communications data, and is launched using DLL search
order hijacking.
PowerShell-Github-Shell — This reverse shell is available from GitHub and was used
against U.S. legal organizations in mid-2017. When executed, it contacts a GitHub gist
account using a hard-coded authentication token and then retrieves commands and
posts data via the gist’s comment section.
Native operating system and Sysinternals tools — BRONZE VINEWOOD has used
PowerShell for code execution, curl to send and retrieve data, and ProcDump to dump
running processes. Attackers commonly use ProcDump rather than a more suspicious
tool such as Mimikatz to obtain hashed passwords from memory.
Variations on Sysinternals tools — CTU analysis suggests that BRONZE VINEWOOD
has used command-line tools such as NetSess to enumerate NetBIOS sessions on a
specified local or remote computer and LG.exe to manage domain groups.

Reconnaissance and initial access

4/10

BRONZE VINEWOOD tailors attacks to its intended victims. For example, the names of
domains used for command and control during network intrusions have mimicked product
names used by the target.
In one 2017 campaign, the threat actors targeted U.S. legal organizations via SQL injection
attacks against a third-party software application predominantly used by companies in that
sector. The SQL injection string attempted to launch PowerShell via the xp_cmdshell stored
procedure. If successful, this command downloaded and executed in memory the
PowerShell-Github-Shell script hosted as a seemingly innocuous file on a GitHub repository
(see Figure 1). The profile attached to the GitHub repository was created shortly before the
campaign commenced. This script can be used to enumerate system information, download
files, and run commands using PowerShell or the Windows command prompt.

In other cases, the threat actors likely leveraged stolen credentials to gain initial access,
sometimes through redundant remote access points that might have less monitoring than live
access points. CTU researchers suspect that the initial attack phases are preceded by
careful reconnaissance of potential targets.

Maintaining access and credential theft
BRONZE VINEWOOD attempts to steal credentials and use legitimate remote access
solutions and protocols, including tunneling RDP over HTTP, to access the environment.
Secureworks incident responders observed the threat actors conducting credential dumps
roughly once every four weeks using Mimikatz installed on compromised domain controllers.
CTU researchers also observed this behavior from the BRONZE UNION threat group and
suspect it is a conscious effort to extract credentials within the likely rolling window of an
organization’s password reset policy. In some cases, BRONZE VINEWOOD leveraged
ProcDump to dump the memory space for the lsass.exe process and used another offline
tool to extract the passwords.
Persistence mechanisms observed by CTU researchers include the use of Task Scheduler
and Windows services to launch malware (see Figure 2) or to directly initiate outbound TCP
connections (see Figure 3). The threat group tends to use the same name (e.g., systemsvc)
for all malicious services within a compromised environment, which can be a useful detection
mechanism.

Discovery and lateral movement
Like other targeted threats, BRONZE VINEWOOD uses a variety of native operating system
and publicly available tools for network discovery and lateral movement. For example, CTU
researchers have observed the threat actors using NetSess and LG.exe for network
discovery and the invoke-SMBExec PowerShell script for lateral movement. In one incident,
BRONZE VINEWOOD unsuccessfully used a compromised Kerberos ticket-granting account
to cut Kerberos tickets to authenticate to network resources. This behavior highlights the
importance of double-resetting Kerberos accounts during evictions to clear old passwords.

Command and control
The threat group is notable for its use of file and code-sharing sites, such as Dropbox and
GitHub, for command and control of its malware. For example, the DropboxAES RAT used
content . dropboxapi . com, the hostname for the deprecated Dropbox API version 1, for its
C2 server. Similar to other China-based threat groups, BRONZE VINEWOOD often “parks”
its C2 domains on 127.0.0.1 when not in use.
6/10

Collection and exfiltration
BRONZE VINEWOOD focuses on stealing data from target networks. The threat actors
collate data of interest on a central host, package the data using a compression tool such as
WinRAR, and then exfiltrate the data by using the curl utility or by copying it during sessions
established with stolen credentials. CTU researchers have observed the threat actors using
simple passwords such as ‘123456’ (see Figure 4) as well as more complex passwords.

Conclusion
BRONZE VINEWOOD remains an active threat as of this publication. Its targeting of a range
of organizations suggest that the threat actors focus on data of interest rather than on
specific verticals. Organizations that provide software or other services to defense and
government agencies, or organizations such as legal firms that aggregate defense and
government data, are likely to be at increased risk from BRONZE VINEWOOD. The use of
fairly unsophisticated tools and techniques is likely a conscious choice. Evidence gleaned
from network intrusions demonstrates that the threat group can successfully leverage
publicly available tools and use popular file and code-sharing websites to blend C2 traffic
with legitimate network traffic.
