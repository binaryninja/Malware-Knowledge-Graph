Introduction
TA551 (also known as Shathak) represents a threat actor behind malspam that has pushed
different families of malware over the past few years. So far this week, TA551 is pushing
IcedID (Bokbot).

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
The infection process was similar to my previous diary about TA551 from August 2021, but
this time it delivered IcedID instead of BazarLoader.

IcedID traffic:

Final words
IcedID can be followed by Cobalt Strike when an infected host is part of an Active Directory
(AD) environment. These types of infections can deliver ransomware as a final payload in
real-world environments.
But decent spam filters and best security practices can help you avoid IcedID. Default
security settings in Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 should prevent these types of
infections from happening.
