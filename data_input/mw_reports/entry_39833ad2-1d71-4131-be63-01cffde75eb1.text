Conti Ransomware

May 12, 2021

Introduction
First seen in May 2020, Conti ransomware has quickly become one of the most common
ransomware variants, according to Coveware. As per Coveware‚Äôs Quarterly Ransomware
Report (Q1 2021), Conti has the 2nd highest market share after Sodinokibi, which we wrote
about here.
In April, we saw a threat actor go from an initial IcedID infection to deploying Conti
ransomware domain wide in two days and 11 hours. The threat actors stayed dormant for
most of this time, before jumping into action on an early Saturday morning. The hands on
keyboard activity lasted for two and a half hours. They utilized RDP, PsExec, and Cobalt
Strike to move laterally within the environment before executing Conti in memory across all
active systems.

Summary
We assess with moderate confidence that the initial vector used by the threat actor was a zip
file, which included a malicious JavaScript file, delivered through a phishing campaign. The
JavaScript file would eventually download and execute the IcedID malware. Discovered in
2017, what started as a commodity malware is now currently being deployed as an initial
access broker by ransomware threat actors.
While there was some initial discovery activity from the IcedID malware, it went quiet, just
beaconing to command and control but not performing any other activity. After being dormant
for over two days, a Cobalt Strike Beacon was dropped and executed on the system infected
with IcedID. The threat actors then ran another round of discovery activity with native
1/26

windows utilities such as nltest.exe, whoami.exe, and net.exe. They then successfully
escalated to SYSTEM privileges via Cobalt Strike‚Äôs built-in ‚Äúnamed pipe impersonation‚Äù
(GetSystem) functionality.
The threat actors continued by moving laterally to the domain controllers on the network
using SMB to transfer and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon. During that time, we observed
port scanning activity from one of the domain controllers, to identify open ports such as SSH,
SMB, MSSQL, RDP and WinRM. After a brief gap of 15 minutes, the threat actors used
PsExec, to copy and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL on most of the systems in the
network.
Later in the attack, the threat actor was seen establishing RDP connections from the
beachhead host to the domain controller and other systems throughout the environment.
This RDP activity was being proxied through the IcedID process running on that host, to a
remote proxy over port 8080.
To establish persistence, the attackers created a new local user on one of the domain
controllers and added it to the Administrators group. Additionally, in an effort to evade any
detection and prevention mechanisms, they disabled Windows Defender via a group policy
modification.
Within two and a half hours of Cobalt Strike showing up in the environment and just over two
days after the initial IcedID infection, the threat actors completed their objective of encrypting
all systems. Conti was executed in memory with the help of the Cobalt Strike Beacons
domain wide. The ransomware note left by the infection included a link to their Tor site for
further details.
After further review of the environment (post encryption), we realized multiple systems
(including a domain controller) were unable to be accessed and would not have been
restorable even if the ransom had been paid.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More
information on this service and others can be found here.
We also have artifacts available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, Kape
packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services.

MITRE ATT&CK
Initial Access
The IcedID DLL that we executed was most likely dropped through a zip file, which included
a JavaScript file within it. Brad had a few posts about these around the time of this intrusion.
1 2 Thanks Brad!

Various attributes including the computer name and the OS version of the compromised
system were sent through encoded cookie values.

IcedID was executed via rundll32.exe and ran command and control over port 443 for the
duration of the intrusion.
rundll32.exe "C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\rate_x32.dat",update
/i:"LaborBetray\license.dat"

Discovery
4/26

IcedID ran initial discovery after being executed on the beachhead. Various commands were
executed to gather more information about the compromised environment; including the
currently logged on user, domain trusts, groups, etc .

ipconfig /all
systeminfo
whoami /groups
net config workstation
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
net view /all /domain
net view /all
new group "Domain Admins" /domain

Additional discovery commands were executed by Cobalt Strike.

5/26

cmd.exe /C whoami /groups
cmd.exe /C query session
cmd.exe /C dir %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%
cmd.exe /C nltest /domain_trusts
cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:
cmd.exe /C net group "Enterprise admins" /domain
cmd.exe /C net group "Domain admins" /domain

After moving laterally to a domain controller, they began looking for what networks were
present in the environment using dsquery.
cmd.exe /C dsquery subnet -limit 0

Shortly thereafter, port scanning was observed coming from a domain controller looking for
common ports (such as SSH, SMB, MSSQL, WinRM and RDP, etc.) on systems residing in
the same subnet.

Privilege Escalation
In order to obtain SYSTEM level privileges, Cobalt Strike‚Äôs built-in named piped
impersonation (GetSystem) was used:
Image: ‚ÄúC:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe‚Äù
CommandLine: ‚ÄúC:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 4d64fbbbf34 > \\.\pipe\b4312c‚Äù
ParentImage: ‚ÄúC:\Windows\System32\runonce.exe‚Äù
ParentCommandLine: ‚ÄúC:\Windows\system32\runonce.exe"

Lateral Movement
The threat actor began lateral movement using remote execution of Cobalt Strike Beacon
service binaries.
Image: C:\Windows\system32\services.exe
TargetObject: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\d8d6deb\ImagePath
Details: \\HOSTNAME\ADMIN$\d8d6deb.exe

6/26

After this initial activity, Cobalt Strike was used to enable RDP, and allow it through the
firewall, on the domain controllers.
cmd.exe /C reg add "hklm\system\currentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v
"fDenyTSConnections" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x0 /f
cmd.exe /C netsh firewall set service type = remotedesktop mode = enable
cmd.exe /C netsh firewall set rule group="remote desktop" new enable=Yes
cmd.exe /C netsh advfirewall set rule group="remote desktop" new enable=Yes

Following this, the threat actors then copied a Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL to the ADMIN$
share; and then, distributed it throughout the environment using PsExec.
cmd.exe /C copy 192145.dll \\<INTERNAL_IP>\ADMIN$ /Y /Z
psexec.exe -accepteula -d -s \\<INTERNAL_IP> rundll32.exe
C:\windows\192145.dll,StartW

7/26

From here, RDP connections were established from the beachhead host to systems
throughout the environment. The connections were proxied through the IcedID process.

The threat actor used a redirector (38.135.122[.]194:8080) to proxy the RDP traffic being
passed through the IcedID process. The below traffic shows more details of the RDP
session, including the username in the cookie.

8/26

üòâ

This proxied traffic reported back the hostname of the threat actors machine as ‚Äúmikespc‚Äù.
We‚Äôre looking for you Mike!

Defense Evasion
To evade detection, the threat actors disabled Windows Defender by adding the below to an
already linked GPO. They then force updated the GPO on all clients using Cobalt Strike.

Persistence
An account named ‚Äúnuuser‚Äù was created by one of the Cobalt Strike Beacons. As these
commands were run on a domain controller, it essentially added the account to the Built-in
Administrators domain group, granting it administrative privileges in the AD domain.
net user /add /Y nuuser [email protected]
net localgroup administrators nuuser /add

Credential Access
LSASS was accessed by an unusual process ‚Äúrunonce.exe‚Äù on multiple hosts, including a
domain controller.

administrator user.

Impact
About two and a half hours after initial hands on keyboard activity, the Cobalt Strike Beacon
processes running across the target systems injected the Conti DLL into memory. Conti
deployments using a DLL seem to have first started showing up in December 2020.
First time that I see #Conti ransomware spread as a DLL :

‚Äî The Brofessor (@Glacius_) December 8, 2020
Some traces of this particular DLL were found in the memory dump taken from one of the
compromised systems.

15/26

We were unable to reconstruct the DLL from memory but Maxime Thiebaut (@0xThiebaut)
from NVISO helped us out. The Yara rule, located in the detections section below was made
possible due to him reconstructing the DLL. Thanks Maxime!
Conti scans the network for 445/SMB, looking for machines to encrypt.

Ransom note

Which leads you here.

16/26

The threat actors asked for 150k and could have been talked down at least ~20%.
Multiple machines within the environment were not usable after being ransomed including a
domain controller. The machines were left like this and you were not able to do anything but
press control+alt+delete. Paying the ransom will not help you here.

Pivots
While researching the infrastructure related to this campaign, we found the threat actor
revealed further infrastructure. The domain associated with the Cobalt Strike C2
(dimentos[.]com) has an unredacted Whois record that reveals several other domains also
registered by the address pokix19891[@]kindbest[.]com. You‚Äôll notice the fake address and
fake phone number as well.

17/26

All the domains were registered on 2021-03-30, and according to public data available in
VirusTotal, three of them have been associated with Cobalt Strike infrastructure so far; the
domain seen in this intrusion, powelin[.]com and awesents[.]com.

18/26

The two other domains (jocinet[.]com, ilimennt[.]com) have subdomains that look like name
servers (ns1 and ns2), which were pointed to two of the Cobalt Strike hosting IP‚Äôs. All of this
infrastructure was hosted on the VPS provider OVH.
