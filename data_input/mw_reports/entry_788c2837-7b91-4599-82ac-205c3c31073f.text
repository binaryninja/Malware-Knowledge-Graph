This blog post on BumbleBee malware was originally published as a FLINT report
(SEKOIA.IO Flash Intelligence) sent to our clients on June 02, 2022.
BumbleBee is a new malicious loader, first reported by Google TAG in March 2022, that is
being used by several Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to gain an initial foothold within victims’
networks.
In recent weeks, many campaigns distributing BumbleBee have been observed in the wild
and the successful compromises often lead to ransomware attacks. Indeed, affiliates of
several ransomware gangs (Conti, LockBit, AvosLocker, Diavol) were observed delivering
BumbleBee in order to drop another payload (Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, Sliver, IcedID,
1/8

Redline, and more) and deploy ransomware. Furthermore, SEKOIA.IO analysts observed the
malware is still in development with new features, and improvements. All these reasons
make the BumbleBee loader a major threat that companies must deal with at the moment.
SEKOIA.IO analysts have been tracking this threat since early April 2022 and have seen
a significant increase in the number of active BumbleBee C2 servers, and observed
samples. The analysis of multiple BumbleBee samples allowed us to identify several
versions and improvements made to the product.

Technical Analysis
In this section, we briefly describe the typical infection chain used to deliver the BumbleBee
loader. We then share technical details on the modifications made in the latest versions of
the malware, and how we track the active C2 server and the malware samples.
Before getting into the technical details, the BumbleBee malware is a sophisticated loader
that aims to download and execute a second payload. It implements several defense and
evasion techniques to hide from detection systems, and to make it harder for security
researchers to analyze the payload.

Typical infection chain
Most of the spearphishing campaigns distributing the BumbleBee loader use the same attack
pattern: an email is sent to the victim with a ZIP archive which contains an ISO file. The
beginning of the attack chain consists of using an ISO file which contains a Windows link
(LNK) used to execute the payload (DLL).
In the following example, the ISO file contains two files:
1. a LNK file New Folder.lnk
2. a DLL executed by the LNK file
As shown in the figure below, when the LNK file is executed, it runs the command below to
start the malicious DLL using rundll32.exe : C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe
procsvc.dll,HWgullOFkZ

distributing BumbleBee
This infection vector is more and more used by various actors: APT (such as NOBELIUM) ,
IABs (to distribute IcedID, BazarLoader, BumbleBee, and more) and other threat actors. This
trend appears to be the consequence of the disabling by default of VBA macros in Microsoft
Office products, which is one (code execution via Office macros) of the most used
techniques by adversaries to get into the network.

Modifications in the latest version
The BumbleBee DLL uses a crypter to deobfuscate another PE that is loaded in a new
memory section. This specific section is quickly identifiable: a simple pattern search in a
debugger on “DOS mode” can highlight the newly allocated memory with read-write-execute
permission.
Once the new section is dumped, the BumbleBee payload can be analyzed. Before anything
else, it is worth noting that the malware used almost a full copy/paste of al-khaser github
project, as mentioned in others articles or related BumbleBee discussions. The al-khaser
code implements several anti-detection techniques. The figure below shows that the main
function of the BumbleBee payload avoids execution if one of the anti-virtual environments is
spotted.

Figure 2. Anti-virtual machine checks in the BumbleBee code
Once the loaded PE is ready and anti-VM checks are passed, the malware decrypts its
Command and Control (C2) IP addresses with a key stored in cleartext in
the .data section using RC4 algorithm. This decryption routine is also used to deobfuscate
its campaign ID.

Figure 3. Deobfuscation routine in BumbleBee loader
In most of the payloads we investigate, three blobs of data are obfuscated using RC4:
1. A list of C2 IP addresses with their associated port
2. A campaign identifier, other analysts identify this ID as the botnet ID
3. A number (often 444 or 4444)

4/8

Figure 4. Recipe in CyberChef to get the obfuscated data
Once, the C2 IP addresses have been deobfuscated, the malware contacts one of its C2 and
then loads the final payload (Meterpreter, Cobalt Strike, or else).
In the initial BumbleBee versions analyzed in April 2022, the malware did not implement any
C2 obfuscation: the IP addresses were stored in clear in the PE. This evolution shows that
BumbleBee is still under development.
NB: We observed a massive usage of the key “ BLACK ” in the dataset of samples we
analyzed and also the key “ iKInPE9WrB “.

Tracking BumbleBee
C2 infrastructure
Tracking the BumbleBee C2 infrastructure is not much different from other botnets such as
BazarLoader, Qakbot and IcedID. The SSL certificates used for the BumbleBee C2 server
are quite specific. After some analysis of malware samples and thanks to search engines for
Internet-connected devices, we were able to identify a common and unique pattern to find
the BumbleBee C2 servers. The final heuristic is based on the SSL certificate and the HTTP
response.
The heuristic results have increased, from 5 C2 servers at the beginning of April to over 130
at the time of writing this FLINT, as shown by the following figure.

This shows that the BumbleBee loader has gained in popularity among the threat actors,
particularly for the Initial Access Brokers.
Samples
At the same time, we have written a YARA rule to find BumbleBee samples – it can be found
in the section of IOCs & Technical Details. The results of the YARA rule uploaded on a
sample sharing platform confirm the trend described previously.
BumbleBee has become in two months a major threat, mostly deployed by Initial Access
Brokers to gain a foothold within a network and drop a second payload. With the malware
being used by affiliates of ransomware gangs, companies need to monitor this
threat and protect their assets from possible BumbleBee compromises.
