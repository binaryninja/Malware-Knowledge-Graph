Executive summary
AT&T Alien Labs™ has been tracking a new IoT botnet dubbed “EnemyBot”, which is believed to be
distributed by threat actor Keksec. During our investigations, Alien Labs has discovered that EnemyBot is
expanding its capabilities, exploiting recently identified vulnerabilities (2022), and now targeting IoT devices,
web servers, Android devices and content management system (CMS) servers. In addition, the malware base
source code can now be found online on Github, making it widely accessible.

Key takeaways:
EnemyBot’s base source code can be found on Github, making it available to anyone who wants to
leverage the malware in their attacks.
The malware is rapidly adopting one-day vulnerabilities as part of its exploitation capabilities.
Services such as VMware Workspace ONE, Adobe ColdFusion, WordPress, PHP Scriptcase and more
are being targeted as well as IoT and Android devices.
The threat group behind EnemyBot, Keksec, is well-resourced and has the ability to update and add
new capabilities to its arsenal of malware on a daily basis (see below for more detail on Keksec)

Background

1/14

First discovered by Securonix in March 2022 and later detailed in an in-depth analysis by Fortinet, EnemyBot
is a new malware distributed by the threat actor “Keksec” targeting Linux machines and IoT devices.
According to the malware Github’s repository, EnemyBot derives its source code from multiple botnets to a
powerful and more adjustable malware. The original botnet code that EnemyBot is using includes: Mirai,
Qbot, and Zbot. In addition, the malware includes custom development (see figure 1).

Figure 1. EnemyBot page on Github.
The Keksec threat group is reported to have formed back in 2016 by a number of experienced botnet actors.
In November 2021, researchers from Qihoo 360 described in detail the threat actor’s activity in a presentation,
attributing to the Keksec the development of botnets for different platforms including Windows and Linux:
Linux based botnets: Tsunami and Gafgyt
Windows based botnets: DarkIRC, DarkHTTP
Dual systems: Necro (developed in Python)

Source code analysis

2/14

The developer of the Github page on EnemyBot self describes as a “full time malware dev,” that is also
available for contract work. The individual states their workplace as “Kek security,” implying a potential
relationship with the broader Keksec group (see figure 2).

Figure 2. EnemyBot developer description.
The malware repository on Github contains four main sections:

cc7.py
This module is a Python script file that downloads all dependencies and compiles the malware into different
OS architectures including x86, ARM, macOS, OpenBSD, PowerPC, MIPS, and more (see figure 3)

Figure 3. Compiling malware source code to macOS executable.
Once compilation is complete, the script then creates a batch file ‘update.sh’ which is used by the bot as a
downloader that is then delivered to any identified vulnerable targets to spread the malware.

Figure 4. Generated `update.sh` file to spread EnemyBot on different architectures.

3/14

enemy.c
This is the main bot source code. Though it is missing the main exploitation function, it includes all other
functionality of the malware and the attacks the bot supports by mixing the various botnet source codes as
mentioned above (Mirai, Qbot, and Zbot) — mainly Mirai and Qbot (see figure 5).

Figure 5. EnemyBot source code.

hide.c
This module is compiled and manually executed to encode / decode the malware’s strings by the attacker to
hide strings in binary. For that, the malware is using a simple swap table, in which each char is replaced with
a corresponding char in the table (see in figure 6).

Figure 6. String decode.

servertor.c
Figure 7 shows the command-and-control component (C&C) botnet controller. C&C will be executed on a
dedicated machine that is controlled by the attacker. It can control and send commands to infected machines.
(figure 7)

New variant analysis
Most of EnemyBot functionality relates to the malware’s spreading capabilities, as well as its ability to scan
public-facing assets and look for vulnerable devices. However, the malware also has DDoS capabilities and
can receive commands to download and execute new code (modules) from its operators that give the
malware more functionality.
In new variants of EnemyBot, the malware added a webscan function containing a total of 24 exploits to
attack vulnerabilities of different devices and web servers (see figure 8).

Figure 8. EnemyBot calls for a new function “webscan_xywz”.
To perform these functions, the malware randomly scans IP addresses and when it gets a response via
SYN/ACK, EnemyBot then scans for vulnerabilities on the remote server by executing multiple exploits.
The first exploit is for the Log4j vulnerability discovered last year as CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046:

Figure 9. Exploiting the Log4J vulnerability.
The malware also can adopt new vulnerabilities within days of those vulnerabilities being discovered. Some
examples are Razer Sila (April 2022) which was published without a CVE (see figure 10) and a remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability impacting VMWare Workspace ONE with CVE-2022-22954 the same month
(see figure 11).

Figure 11. Exploiting vulnerability in VMWare Workspace ONE.
EnemyBot has also begun targeting content management systems (e.g. Wordpress) by searching for
vulnerabilities in various plugins, such as “Video Synchro PDF” (see figure 12).

Figure 12. EnemyBot targeting WordPress servers.
In the example shown in figure 12, notice that the malware elevates a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability into
a RCE by injecting malicious code into the ‘/proc/self/environ’. This method is not new and was described in
2009. The malware uses LFI to call ‘environ’ and passes the shell command in the user agent http header.
Another example of how the malware uses this method is shown in figure 13. In this example the malware is
exploiting a vulnerability in DBltek GoIP.

In case an Android device is connected through USB, or Android emulator running on the machine,
EnemyBot will try to infect it by executing shell command. (figure 14)

Figure 14. EnemyBot "adb_infect" function to attack Android devices.
After infection, EnemyBot will wait for further commands from its C&C. However, in parallel it will also further
propogate by scanning for additional vulnerable devices. Alien Labs has listed below the commands the bot
can receive from its C&C (accurate as of the publishing of this article).

Recommended actions
1. Maintain minimal exposure to the Internet on Linux servers and IoT devices and use a properly
configured firewall.
2. Enable automatic updates to ensure your software has the latest security updates.
3. Monitor network traffic, outbound port scans, and unreasonable bandwidth usage.

Conclusion
Keksec’s EnemyBot appears to be just starting to spread, however due to the authors’ rapid updates, this
botnet has the potential to become a major threat for IoT devices and web servers. The malware can quickly
adopt one-day vulnerabilities (within days of a published proof of concept). This indicates that the Keksec
group is well resourced and that the group has developed the malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities
before they are patched, thus increasing the speed and scale at which it can spread.
