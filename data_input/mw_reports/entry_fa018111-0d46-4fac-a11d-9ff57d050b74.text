Mac Spyware: OSX/KitM (Kumar in the Mac)

Posted by Sean @ 12:45 GMT

There's another case of Backdoor:OSX/KitM.A in the wild.
A German-based investigator reached out to us yesterday regarding OSX/KitM. (We
wrote about it last week.) KitM stands for "Kumar in the Mac", which is our designation
for spyware — related to OSX/Filesteal a.k.a. OSX/HackBack — that is signed using an
Apple Developer ID in the name of Rajinder Kumar. The Developer ID has since been
revoked by Apple.
This latest version of OSX/KitM used a Romanian C&C server called liveapple.eu during
the period of attack, December 2012 to early February 2013. The spear phishing used
an attachment called Christmas_Card.app.zip. (Remember, the attack started in
December.)
So, that brings us to this bit of advice for those of you who might be targets.
This is the default "Gatekeeper" security setting:

1/3

Mac App Store and identified developers
This is the setting that you want, unless you're actively installing software:

2/3

Mac App Store
This is the prompt that results when OSX/KitM attempts to install with the stricter setting:

If you're running OS X Mountain Lion or Lion v10.7.5 — adjust your settings as an extra
layer of precaution.
