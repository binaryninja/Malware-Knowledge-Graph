About Stitch
A Cross Platform Python Remote Administration Tool:
This is a cross platform python framework which allows you to build custom payloads for
Windows, Mac OSX and Linux as well. You are able to select whether the payload binds to a
specific IP and port, listens for a connection on a port, option to send an email of system info
when the system boots, and option to start keylogger on boot. Payloads created can only run
on the OS that they were created on.

Webcam snapshots? (untested on Linux)

Implemented Transports
All communication between the host and target is AES encrypted. Every Stitch program
generates an AES key which is then put into all payloads. To access a payload the AES keys
must match. To connect from a different system running Stitch you must add the key by using
the showkey command from the original system and the addkey command on the new
system.

Implemented Payload Installers
The "stitchgen" command gives the user the option to create NSIS installers on Windows
and Makeself installers on posix machines. For Windows, the installer packages the payload
and an elevation exe ,which prevents the firewall prompt and adds persistence, and places
the payload on the system. For Mac OSX and Linux, the installer places the payload and
attempts to add persistence. To create NSIS installers you must download and install NSIS.

Motivation
My motivation behind this was to advance my knowledge of python, hacking, and just to see
what I could accomplish. Was somewhat discouraged and almost abandoned this project
when I found the amazing work done by n1nj4sec, but still decided to put this up since I had
already come so far.
