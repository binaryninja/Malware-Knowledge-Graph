Overall damage to banks, merchants, card companies, and
consumers estimated at more than $3 billion
Seattle – The first high-level manager of the notorious hacking group FIN7 was sentenced
today in U.S. District Court in Seattle to ten years in prison, announced Acting U.S. Attorney
Tessa A. Gorman. Fedir Hladyr, 35, a Ukranian national, served as a high-level manager
and systems administrator for FIN7. He was arrested in Dresden, Germany, in 2018 at the
request of U.S. law enforcement and was extradited to Seattle. In September 2019, he
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit
computer hacking. At today’s sentencing hearing, Chief U.S. District Judge Ricardo S.
Martinez said, “Cybercrime has become the greatest threat to American’s financial health,
and to citizens around the globe.”

“This criminal organization had more than 70 people organized into business units and
teams. Some were hackers, others developed the malware installed on computers, and still
others crafted the malicious emails that duped victims into infecting their company systems,”
said Acting U.S. Attorney Gorman. “This defendant worked at the intersection of all these
activities and thus bears heavy responsibility for billions in damage caused to companies and
individual consumers.”
According to records filed in the case, since at least 2015, FIN7 members (also referred to as
Carbanak Group and the Navigator Group, among other names) engaged in a highly
sophisticated malware campaign to attack hundreds of U.S. companies, predominantly in the
restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer
systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers which were used or
sold for profit.
FIN7, through its dozens of members, launched numerous waves of malicious cyberattacks
on numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad. FIN7 carefully crafted
email messages that would appear legitimate to a business’s employees and accompanied
emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the email. Once an attached file
was opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the notorious Carbanak
malware in addition to an arsenal of other tools ultimately to access and steal payment card
data for the business’s customers. Since 2015, many of the stolen payment card numbers
have been offered for sale through online underground marketplaces.
In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of businesses
in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 20 million customer card
records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate
business locations. Additional intrusions occurred abroad, including in the United Kingdom,
Australia, and France. Companies that have publicly disclosed hacks attributable to FIN7
include such familiar chains as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili’s, Arby’s, Red Robin, and
Jason’s Deli.
“These cyber thieves orchestrated an elaborate network of hackers and systems to infiltrate
businesses and exploit consumers’ personal information,” said Donald M. Voiret, FBI Special
Agent in Charge of the Seattle Field Office. “Their specialized skills to target certain
industries amplified the damage exponentially. Thanks to the hard work of law enforcement
partners both in the U.S. and overseas, these fraudsters are not beyond our reach and
cannot hide from the law.”
Hladyr originally joined FIN7 via a front company called Combi Security—a fake cyber
security company that had a phony website and no legitimate customers. Hladyr admitted in
his plea agreement that he quickly realized that, far from being a legitimate company, Combi
was part of a criminal enterprise. Hladyr served as FIN7’s systems administrator who,
among other things, played a central role in aggregating stolen payment card information,

supervising FIN7’s hackers, and maintaining the elaborate network of servers that FIN7 used
to attack and control victims’ computers. Hladyr also controlled the organization’s encrypted
channels of communication.
Speaking to the court, Hladyr said he had “ruined years of my life and put [his] family through
great risk and struggle.”
Noting that cyber criminals must be deterred by significant sentences, Chief Judge Martinez
said he was cognizant of the “ease of sitting at a keyboard and stealing money from people
around the globe” and emphasized that would-be cybercriminals “must understand that, once
caught, the punishment will be significant.” The judge also ordered Hladyr to pay $2.5 million
in restitution.
This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Seattle Cyber Task Force of the
FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington, with the assistance
of the Justice Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Office of
International Affairs, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, numerous computer
security firms and financial institutions, FBI offices across the nation and globe, as well as
numerous international agencies. German law enforcement authorities provided significant
assistance by arresting Hladyr.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Francis Franze-Nakamura and
Steven Masada of the Western District of Washington, and Trial Attorney Anthony
Teelucksingh of the Justice Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.
