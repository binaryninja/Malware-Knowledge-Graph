Abstract. On March 20, 2013 a cyber attack now known as Dark Seoul, paralyzed several major banking services and
broadcasters in South Korea. Labeled by the media as cyber terror, the attack significantly disrupted these services for at least one
day. Despite these facts, various indicators suggest that the attack had a low level of sophistication. Major cyber attacks in the
past such as Ten Days of Rain and the SK Communications breach employed far more advanced techniques compared to Dark
Seoul. We examine the technical details of Dark Seoul by outlining the primary attack vector used, describing the malware
components, and discussing the malware’s evasion techniques. Furthermore we compare this incident to previous attacks in order
to determine its technical sophistication using these attacks as a relative benchmark. Lastly we explore various malware design
techniques that were not used in the malware such as multiple propagation vectors, 0-day exploits, and evasion techniques, thus
presenting a proof of concept of the malware’s low technical sophistication.
Keywords: advanced persistent threat; cyber attack; Dark Seoul; defense; malware analysis;

A. INTRODUCTION
On March 20, 2013, at approximately 14.15PM South
Korea suffered a cyber attack that resulted in the denial of
service of several major banks and broadcasters. Reported as a
major cyber attack, our analysis of the malware and attack
vectors employed suggests that the malware had a relatively
low level of technical sophistication. Firstly we explore the
technical components of Dark Seoul to analyze the
sophistication of the malware and attack vectors used. This
analysis is based on information obtained from the media as
well as technical reports of various malware research labs such
as AhnLab, Imperva, Symantec, Avast, Kaspersky, Alienvault,
and Sophos. Secondly we conduct a comparative study of
Dark Seoul by looking at prior cyber attacks, namely Stuxnet,
10 Days of Rain, and the SK Communications breach. By
doing so we draw a picture of South Korea’s current security
posture since those attacks. Lastly we discuss several design
characteristics of advanced malware used by determined
adversaries to carry out more technically advanced and
stealthier attacks, therefore highlighting the components where
Dark Seoul lacked sophistication.

In this paper we take an in-depth look of the malware by
examining the attack vectors used, and later discuss whether
the claims in the media are warranted. According to the
investigating team consisting of government, military, and
civilian members, as many as 76 samples of malware were
collected from infected machines [2]. We present the most
likely primary attack vector used by the attackers by
discussing information summarized from reports by Avast [3],
Trend Micro [4], and Symantec [5][6] issued in the first few
days following the attack.

B. POSTMORTEM
Television broadcasters YTN, MBC, and banks KBS,
Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju were targeted in this recent
attack. The Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA) reported
that about 48,000 computers were affected making services
inaccessible and the victim organizations needed weeks to
fully restore all functions [1]. In terms of impact, the attackers
managed to successfully penetrate the target networks, pivot
their way into critical assets, wipe out systems, cause denial of
services, and trigger enough public response to spur the media
into using terminology such as cyber terror and advanced
persistent threats.

1. Spearphishing

Trend Micro researchers discovered a phishing email sent
to South Korean organizations on March 19. The email
contained a malicious Trojan downloader which the
researchers report to have been detected by their Deep
Discovery software. This is likely to be the initial attack point.

CISAK 2013 – C1/O/8

2. Launch Platform – Cross-Site Scripting
Avast detected the attacks originating from the Korea
Software
Property
Right-Council
(SPC)
website
(http://www.spc.or.kr) possibly infected via the phishing email
sent on the 19th. Usage of a legitimate website/server in the
target nation/region for launching attacks is a common tactic
used to minimize detection. The SPC website contained
JavaScript causing the client browser to load an iframe loading
the contents of http://rootadmin2012.com, which was the main
attack site for hosting the malicious payloads.

3. Exploitation
Examination of rootadmin2012.com revealed heapspray
and shellcodes with references to Internet Explorer (IE). Avast
managed to identify the vulnerability exploited as CVE-20121889 [7] which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code or cause a denial of service via a crafted website. The
vulnerability targets Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0 – 6.0
with a published metasploit exploit targeting MS XML Core
Services 3.0 via IE6 and IE7 over Windows XP [8]. After
gaining access the second stage downloader file (sun.exe)
performs the following actions:
a.

Check for internet connection: Downloads an
image from naver.com.

b.

Local DNS cache poisoning: Redirects requests
to certain Korean banking websites listed in
Figure 2 to another server in Japan.

Update download counter: Runs a counter script

d. Makes itself persistent: Modifies the Windows
registry by adding value with name “skunser”
and data “C:\ntldrs\svchest.exe”, where it was
previously copied to.
e. Download backdoor: Downloads dropper file
pao.exe
from
http://www.hisunpharm.com/
files/File/product/ and stores it to C:\Program
Files\tongji2.exe
f. Drops and execute batch file: schedules
downloader every 30 minutes and ensures
svchest.exe is started with Local System
privileges.

4. Post-exploitation
The tongji2.exe module injects itself into iexplore.exe in an
attempt to mask itself. Avast classified this as a backdoor
Trojan and infostealer. This malware allowed attackers to

control the computer as a compromised zombie part of a wider
botnet network – a theory suggested by Alienvault [9] – which
then wiped hard disks, and harvested personal information.
Examination of the file names and the Safeengine executable
protector suggest that the malware was made in China.
Although capable of executing many functions, only the
following were widely utilized in the attack:
a. Antivirus disablement: Malware attempts to disable
Ahnlab and Hauri antivirus.
b. Command & control (C&C): Using a simple XOR
loop for encryption, the malware attempts to connect
to laoding521.eicp.net over port 889 to communicate
with the attackers.
c. Harddisk wiper: Symantec identified Trojan.Jokra as
the malware component that wiped harddisks in the
attack. It is likely that it was downloaded onto the
victim’s computer after receiving an instruction by
the C&C servers. The malware overwrites the master
boot record (MBR) and the rest of the harddisk with
the strings “PRINCIPES” or “HASTATI.”. Other
attached drives or removable devices may also be
targeted. The malware then forces the computer to
restart thus making it unusable. An interesting
feature of this malware is that it has components to
wipe out harddisks on both Windows and Linux
platforms. Detailed analysis of Jokra can be found
here [10].
d. Information harvesting: After gaining root privileges
the attackers can intercept any information that goes
in or out of the infected computer. However the most
apparent information taken was user credentials. As
a result of DNS poisoning, users believe they are
accessing the authentic internet banking website, but
are decepted into interacting with a fake website. An
error message pops up stating that the user’s
computer was infected by a virus and that for
security reasons they need to apply for a fraud
prevention service. If the user clicks the OK button,
the user is directed to a page requesting their name
and national identification number. If the format
entered is correct, the user is then asked to fill in
more details including address, phone number, etc..

C. CASE STUDIES:
ATTACKS

PREVIOUS

MAJOR

CYBER

1. Stuxnet
Stuxnet was discovered in July 2010, but the earliest
known variant is confirmed to have existed since 2007 [11].
Stuxnet caught many security researchers and professionals by
surprise, being the first advanced malware of its kind.
According to Symantec’s report [12], Stuxnet is a complex
threat that was primarily written to target an industrial control
system (ICS) or set of similar systems. A vast array of
components was implemented in the malware including four
0-Day exploits, a windows rootkit, antivirus evasion
techniques, complex process injection and hooking code,

CISAK 2013 – C1/O/8

network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, a command
and control interface, as well as the first ever PLC rootkit.
Stuxnet’s main payload has the main purpose of modifying
code on Siemens industrial PLCs in order to sabotage the
system. It is widely believed that Iran’s Natanz nuclear Fuel
Enrichment Plant (FEP) was the intended target. Hosts in five
domains of organizations based in Iran were heavily infected
over 3 attack waves. The deliberate containment of the
malware to targets in Iran is also apparent from the number of
hosts infected worldwide, which reached only around 100,000
with approximately 60% being in Iran. This attack has been
claimed to setback Iran’s nuclear program by several years as
1,000 out of 9,000 centrifuges were disabled and had to be
replaced [13]. The initial attack point is likely to be via a USB
infection.

2. 10 days of Rain
On March 4, 2011, exactly 20 months after a similar
incident during the U.S. Independence Day celebrations of
2009, a botnet based in South Korea launched DDoS attacks
against 40 websites affiliated with South Korean government,
military, and civilian critical infrastructure as well as U.S.
forces based in Korea [14]. The botnet was dynamically
updated via new malware binaries, launched a DDoS non-stop
for more than a week, and then wiped the harddisks with
zeroes, overwriting the MBR making the machines unusable.
This attack used malware with a much higher level of
sophistication than is necessary to launch a trivial distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attack. Encryption of code and
configurations using cipher algorithms such as the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES), RSA, and Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4)
enabled them to evade detection and prolong analysis. A
multitier botnet architecture included 40 C&C servers
distributed across the globe including servers in the USA,
Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and India. Highlighting the
overkill in this attack, McAfee went so far as to call it
“analogous to bringing a Lamborghini to a go-cart race” [15].
Considering the limited timeframe scope and target list,
McAfee suggested the motivation of the attack was a cyber
war exercise to test the preparedness of South Korea’s cyber
defense capabilities and to better understand the technical
requirements for a successful campaign.

3. SK Communications – CyWorld
In July 2011 SK Communications became the victim of an
attack that resulted in the loss of the personal details of 35
million users [16]. The users of CyWorld and Nate, services
owned by SK Communications, were affected by this attack.
Judging from the sophistication of the attack and the time
needed for planning it, researchers concluded that the attack
was likely to be carried out by an Advanced Persistent Threat.
Between July, 18 and 25, more than 60 computers were
infected then used to gain access to the user databases. The
launch point was a South Korean software company’s update
server, normally used to deliver software updates to customers
[17]. The attackers compromised the server and created a
Trojan that would be downloaded to user computers during a
routine update. Poor change management policy resulted in the

full trust of software updates, allowing attackers to fully
exploit this weakpoint. During this time attackers used C&C
servers to monitor the activities on the infected machines and
uploaded tools on a previously compromised legitimate
Taiwanese website. An elaborate infrastructure of waypoints
and C&C servers was created to make tracing the sources of
their activities difficult. In-depth investigation of the attack
reveal that preparation went back as early as September 2010
before finally culminating in the compromise of the user
databases between July 26-28, 2011.
Comparing Dark Seoul with previous attacks shows that it
was technically low in sophistication while causing high
impact to the organizations affected. An intuitive indicator of
this sophistication is that it was completely preventable if the
organizations had used existing software updates and antivirus
solutions, whereas prior attacks could not have been detected.
However judging from the high number of infections, services
disrupted, and the fact that information was being harvested
from the infected machines at least 8 months [18] before the dday wipeout, we consider the impact to be high.

D. ADVANCED MALWARE DESIGN
1. Multiple Propagation Vectors
To increase the probability of successfully infecting the
target systems, various propagation vectors should be
embedded into the malware. The most likely attack vector is
social engineering via phishing emails, USB sticks, and other
techniques. Although people can be used as the initial point of
entry, propagation needs to continue laterally through the
network till the specific target host is reached. During this
process the malware may need higher privileges (e.g. root) and
further exploits will be utilized. Therefore the persistent
adversary will need to consider multiple vectors to infiltrate
target systems.

2. 0-day Exploits
The problem with publicly published vulnerabilities is
people can defend against them. 0-day exploits are written to
exploit vulnerabilities that have not been disclosed to the
public nor the concerned software vendor. These exploits are
at the core payload of any advanced malware, and are virtually
unstoppable until vendors release a patch or anti-virus
providers come up with a signature definition. The only other
method of minimizing the 0-day threat is by actively designing
security into software. Dark Seoul did not use any 0-days.

3. Evasion Techniques
The deployment of anti-virus software, intrusion detection
systems, firewalls and other malware detection or prevention
technology has done much to defend against many attacks.
Advanced malware bypasses these defenses by employing
techniques such as dynamic botnet obfuscation, network based
fragmentation and session splicing, application or protocol
violations, disabling intrusion detection systems (IDSs), to
more advanced techniques such as encryption and code reuse
attacks [19]. Carefully crafted exploits can avoid even
advanced heuristic detection algorithms used in today’s antivirus software. Evasion techniques are crucial for successful
attacks against high level targets, such as in the case of the
Iranian nuclear program.

E. CONCLUSION
Dark Seoul was a low tech threat which managed to
escalate into a high impact attack. Successful in carrying out
its goals, the malware was lacking in many areas that would be
typically found in attacks by advanced persistent threats. We
highlighted the components of the malware used and the
possible design principles that could have been employed to
make the attack more sophisticated.
South Korea is more at risk now than before the attack, as
now adversaries less capable than advanced persistent threats
realize they could also successfully perform damaging attacks.
Undertaking the needed remediation strategies to prevent
similar attacks as well as understanding the anatomy of more
advanced malware is vital for mounting an adequate defense
against the advanced cyber threats.
