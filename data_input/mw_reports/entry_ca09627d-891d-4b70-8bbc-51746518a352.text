TA505 Malware Threat Insights

Proofpoint researchers are continuing to monitor malicious threat actor activity surrounding
COVID-19. To date, the cumulative volume of coronavirus-related email lures now represents
the greatest collection of attack types united by a single theme that our team has seen in
years, if not ever. We’ve observed credential phishing, malicious attachments, malicious
links, business email compromise (BEC), fake landing pages, downloaders, spam, and
malware, among others, all leveraging coronavirus lures.
Over the past week, the team observed a campaign from TA505, the group behind Locky
ransomware and the Dridex banking Trojan, that uses a coronavirus lure as part of a
downloader campaign targeting the U.S. healthcare, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals
industries.
The team also found a separate coronavirus-themed campaign that uses a downloader,
targets the healthcare industry, and demands Bitcoin payment. Indicating a potential future
shift in the attack landscape, the downloaders used in the above two campaigns are
sometimes seen as a first stage payload before ransomware is later downloaded and
installed on a victim’s machine. Ransomware is typically delivered as either second or later
stage payload.
We’ve additionally seen TA564 using coronavirus emails to target Canadian users by
spoofing the Public Health Agency of Canada in an attempt to deliver Ursnif.

New TA505 Malware and Campaign Examples
As everyone around the world continues to search online for the latest developments and
news around coronavirus, Proofpoint researchers have observed TA505, the group behind
the Locky ransomware, using a coronavirus lure in an attempt to deliver a downloader to a
victim’s computer. Once delivered, attackers can then download additional types of malware
including banking Trojans and ransomware. TA505 is known as one of the most significant
financially motivated threat actors due to the extraordinary volumes of messages they send.

We have also separately seen coronavirus-themed emails with downloaders targeting
healthcare organizations that request Bitcoin payments. Figure 2 below shows an email
offering coronavirus remedies in exchange for Bitcoin.

We’ve also seen TA564 using coronavirus emails targeting Canadian users by spoofing the
Public Health Agency of Canada in an attempt to deliver Ursnif. Ursnif is a common banking
Trojan that can steal stored data, including passwords, from banking websites via web
injections, proxies, and VNC connections.
Figure 3 below shows an email addressing “parents and guardians,” with a reported update
from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Medical Officer of Health, listing the individual’s
correct name.

Summary of TA505 Coronavirus Attacks
We anticipate TA505 malware attackers will continue to leverage COVID-19 (as detailed in
our new Redline Stealer Threat Insight blog) as it develops further worldwide and will also
likely pursue potential targets who are now being asked to work from home. Stay vigilant for
malicious emails regarding remote access and fake corporate websites, all aimed at
ensnaring teleworkers. When working remotely, be sure to use a secure Wi-Fi connection,
protect your VPN log-in, use strong passwords, think twice about clicking on links, and
confirm all transactions are authentic.
We’ll continue posting future TA505 attack news as well as coronavirus campaigns and
insights on our threat research Twitter account: https://twitter.com/threatinsight. You can also
review additional coronavirus-themed campaign examples on conspiracy theories and global
shipping concerns in our previous posts.
