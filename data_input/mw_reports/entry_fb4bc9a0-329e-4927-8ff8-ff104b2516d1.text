There are many ways to fight cyber-crime, but what we used to do in Yoroi is Malware
analysis and Incident response by using special and proprietary technologies. Often
analyses are enough to temporary block cyber-criminals by sharing to everybody IOC
allowing National and International players (ISP, AV vendors, CERTs and so on) to block
connections or to trash files. But sometimes when a ransomware hits a victim, the ultimate
desire is to be able to decrypt those files and to restore the last consistent data set. Today
we realized this ultimate scope and we want to release it public, to everybody needs a
decryptor for LooCipher.
At the beginning of July Yoroi Z-Lab Team publicly released a quite exhaustive report about
LooCipher (available here). The initial vector (through Microsoft Office Macro) was
foreshadowing an important spread over the next few days. Indeed few days later Fortinet
researchers released a nice report on LooCipher (available here) mostly focused on the
encryption algorithm, where they discussed it through a python POC.
“LooCipher starts its encryption routine by generating a 16-byte data block with random
characters chosen from the following predefined characters, using the current system
time as seed. ”

Most of the LooCipher technical features are described as follows:
The ransomware spreads using weaponized Word document.
The Command and Control is hosted on the TOR Network, at the following onion
address “hxxp://hcwyo5rfapkytajg[.]onion” .
The attackers leverage several Tor2Web proxy services to easily allow the access to
the Tor C2.
The binary can work both as cryptor and decryptor.
The C2 dynamically generates a different Bitcoin address for each infection.
The Fortinet researches spent time in describing the used algorithm (AES-256-ECB) and
portrayed a decryption code as showed in the following image. By focusing on how to
recover the obfuscated key – which was retrievable either via network or via memory
dumping Fortinet researchers gave us the right reading key to be able to write our own
decryptor code.

From Fortinet Report
The turning point was on the way the key was encoded. The obfuscation method was quite
trivial. It consists in a simple find-and-replace of each key characters with a pre-defined
double-digit number, belonging to the following set:

Decoding Matrix
So once retrieved the obfuscated key it was possible to reconstruct the original key to
decrypt all involved files.

The master key is available directly in memory into LooCipher segments. So please
remember to not kill the process even if you have been infected or to not reboot your
windows box. If you kill the process or reboot your system, ZLab Team decrypter is not going
to work there. You can download it HERE and use it for free.
1. Find the Process ID of the LooCipher ransomware
2. Open cmd with the Administrator privileges in the path where is downloaded the tool
3. In cmd prompt: ZLAB_LOOCIPHER_DECRYPTION_TOOL.exe <PID>
Happy recovery !
