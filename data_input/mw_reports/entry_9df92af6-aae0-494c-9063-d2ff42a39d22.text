In late 2016, Cyber threat analysts in PwC and BAE Systems began assisting victims of a
new global cyber espionage campaign. They named the campaign Operation Cloud Hopper.
Cloud Hopper turned out to be an attack of unprecedented scale that targeted companies
known as “managed IT service providers”, or MSPs. Because MSPs manage the IT systems
of hundreds of clients, the technique used by the Cloud Hopper attackers was highly
effective – they gained access not only to the sensitive data of the MSPs themselves, but
also to their clients globally.
By attacking a handful of companies, the Cloud Hopper actors gained access to potentially
thousands of networks.

The Cloud Hopper analysis by PwC and BAE Systems
APT10 was behind Cloud Hopper
PwC and BAE assessed that Operation Cloud Hopper was almost certainly managed by the
threat actor known within the Information Security community as “APT10”. This assessment
was based on the group’s highly interconnected network of infrastructure, which had
connections with APT10’s previous operations. The Palo Alto Networks report menuPass
Returns with New Malware and New Attacks Against Japanese Academics and
Organizations shows that a series of old APT10 command and control (C2) domains
(including cmdnetview[.]com) associated with servers that were later used by the Cloud
Hopper group.
The Cloud Hopper report released by PwC and BAE assessed that APT10 had significantly
increased its scale and capability since early 2016 and was focused on espionage activity by
targeting intellectual property and other sensitive data.
It was also assessed at the time that APT10 was highly likely to be a China-based threat
actor, based on a series of clues including the compile times of binaries, registration times of
domains, activity indicating a pattern of work in line with China Standard Time and a mix of
diplomatic and political targets being closely aligned with China’s strategic interests.

So what?
Analysts working with this blog have spent the last year investigating the most damaging
attacks to hit Western companies, starting with APT10.
We have identified a number of individuals behind the attack and the companies with which
they have been associated.
We plan to tell the story – check back for more over the next month…
