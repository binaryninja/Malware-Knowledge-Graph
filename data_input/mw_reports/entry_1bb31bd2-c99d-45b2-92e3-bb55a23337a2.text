Cybereason Exposes Campaign Targeting US Taxpayers with NetWire and Remcos
Malware
cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-exposes-malware-targeting-us-taxpayers

Over the past year, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team has observed various trends among cyber criminals and nation-state groups leveraging
various global events such as COVID-19 and other topical themes and trending issues as phishing content to lure their victims into installing
their malware of choice.
As the tax season is already here, Cybereason detected a new campaign targeting US taxpayers with documents that purport to contain taxrelated content, ultimately delivering NetWire and Remcos - two powerful and popular RATs (remote access trojans) which can allow attackers
to take control of the victims’ machines and steal sensitive information.

Key Points
Leveraging US Tax Season to lure victims: Each year, by April 15th, all US citizens are expected to deliver their tax returns.
Cybereason detected a phishing campaign targeting US taxpayers.
Delivering two types of commodity malware: Two infamous remote access tools (RATs) are being used in this campaign, NetWire and
Remcos, each manifesting as binaries delivered via malicious documents.
Evading heuristic and AV detection mechanisms: The malicious documents that infect the user are roughly 7MB in size, which allows
them to evade traditional AV mechanisms and heuristic detection.
Abuse of legitimate cloud services: The infection chain uses cloud services such as “imgur” to store the Netwire and Remcos
payloads, hidden in image files
Steganography: Payloads are concealed and downloaded within image files, combined with the fact they are hosted on public cloud
services makes them even harder to detect.
Exploiting legitimate OpenVPN clients: As a part of the infection process, a legitimate OpenVPN client is downloaded and executed
then sideloads a malicious DLL that drops NetWire/Remcos.

Background
The campaign bears resemblance to another campaign observed in April of 2020 which also delivered the NetWire RAT. Both NetWire and
Remcos are commercial RATs that are available for purchase online for rather affordable prices of as little as US$10 per month. Both offer
various licensing plans and following the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, offering their customers a subscription-based model with
services such as 24/7 support and software updates:

Infection Vector: Lure Documents Containing a Malicious Macro
The infection vector that lures the users into installing the malware is a tax return themed Word document containing a malicious macro:

Malicious documents submitted to VirusTotal

Once the document has been opened, the content in the background is allegedly blurred, and the “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content”
prompts must be manually confirmed by the user:

This is a known social engineering method used to encourage the user to enable embedded macros to run on their machine. Once the
malicious content is being executed, an embedded and heavily obfuscated macro is ran on the victim’s machine:

The above code partially shows that the payload is eventually dropped in the users “Temp” directory:

The DLL dropped by the macro code

Finally, the DLL is injected into notepad and continues the infection chain.

Loaders
The “sid.dll” loader that was dropped by the macro was observed to have at least two different variants: one is a loader for Remcos, and the
other is a loader for NetWire. Looking at their exports, both loaders share the same “payload” exported method:
The loader’s exported methods

Upon execution, the “payload” method starts decrypting data using a XOR key:

The first decrypted part is an additional executable code, and the second part is decrypting the URL the loader connects to in order to
download the next execution stage:

The decrypted initial C2 URL

Eventually, the malicious code is injected into “tracert.exe” that downloads the OpenVPN client along with a trojanized DLL file called
“libcrypto-1_1.dll”, which will be side-loaded to the OpenVPN client upon execution. A similar process, most likely by the same threat actor,
was mentioned earlier this year and describes documents that date back to middle 2020. It then creates a persistence for the VPN client by
creating automatic execution of a .lnk file (C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Temp\openvpn-gui.lnk).

OpenVPN DLL Sideloading
The malicious code in the sideloaded DLL unpacks an additional DLL in-memory and injects it into “notepad.exe”. A secondary payload hidden
in an image file is then downloaded from “imgur.com”, a well-known cloud image storage service. The decrypted payload can be either
NetWire or Remcos:

Remcos
The features for the Remcos RAT can be found on its official website, and includes:
• Remote execution of shell commands on the infected machine
• Downloading and execution of additional payloads
• Screen capture
• Clipboard data management
The version that is used in this campaign is 3.0.0 professional, which also offers support and software updates:

netwire
NetWire has been active for years, and in 2019 a new version was spotted in the wild. Some of the most notable features of NetWire include:
• Downloading and execution of additional payloads
• File and system managers
• Screen capture
• Browser credentials and history theft
• Gathering information about the victim’s system

5/10

Similar to Remcos, the NetWire malware also contains indicative hardcoded strings:

Cybereason Detection and Prevention
The Cybereason Defense Platform detects the execution of a malicious Word document used in the operation:

Once persistence is created in the first stage, the second stage of the attack is also detected, monitoring Remcos/NetWire injected into
cmd.exe:

Corresponding Malops(™) are then triggered:

When the malicious sideloaded DLL is loaded by “openvpn-gui” in Prevention Mode, the Cybereason Defense Platform also detects the code
injection into “notepad.exe” and prevents it from executing further:

Conclusion
Social engineering via phishing has been, and continues to be, the preferred infection method among cyber criminals and nation-state threat
actors alike. In order to succeed, the threat actor must choose an interesting theme that is likely to lure its victim into opening the weaponized
document or link.
In the campaign, we have demonstrated how cybercriminals are leveraging the US tax season to infect American taxpayers with the Remcos
and NetWire remote access trojans, granting the malware operators full access and control over the victims’ machines. The sensitive
information collected from the victims can be used by the attackers to carry out financial fraud or can be traded in the underground
communities.
Cybereason also noticed efforts by the threat actor designed the campaign to stay under the radar, using various techniques such as
steganography, storing payloads on legitimate cloud-based services, and exploiting DLL sideloading against a legitimate software.
