Targeted Attacks on Central
Management Systems

Last year, one of the top security threat that organizations faced was the exploit attacks on software
vulnerabilities alongside ransomware. In particular, the main target of attack was the central
management system, which is used by companies and institutions to apply a common policy to
internal systems or to distribute specific files. The central management system is chosen by the
attackers as it consists of the management server and the agent, which can be used to quickly and
easily infect a large number of users with malware.

This report analyzes the current status of malware distribution and attack trends on the central
management system.

Malware distribution
As shown in Figure 1-1, the central management
system consists of the management server
and agent installed client. The management
server is a system for managing the subordinate
PCs; the administrator can send files or
policies to the PCs connected to the server

via the management page. The client installed with the agent executes the files received from the
management server and follows commands. Then the attacker exploits the composition of these
servers and agents to distribute malware through the file distribution function.

Method of attack
The attacks on the central management system can be generalized into two main types: management server account attacks and vulnerability attacks on agents installed in the client PC.

Attacks using management server accounts
Through the central management system, security policies can be applied or executable files
can be distributed to PCs connected through the management server, and the agent can even
be remotely controlled. Thus the attacker can hack the login information of the administrator
to tamper with the distribution phase to distribute a malware instead. Any agents that have
downloaded the malicious file from the server are then infected with malware.

Also, the management server has the role of getting the anti-virus program or the security update
file from the external server. The attacker can exploit this process to change the file slotted for
download in the update server into a malicious file for internal distribution.

Attacks using agent vulnerability
Each agent installed on the client PC receives the command sent from the management server
for execution. In addition to executing commands, it also executes files distributed from the
management server. The agent has a function to check whether the command issued by the server
is suitable and check for the validity of the file. With the understanding of management algorithm

for these type of functions, the attacker disguises as the management server to send a command
to the agent.

Attack Cases
Here is a detailed description on attack cases which exploited the central management software in
South Korea to distribute malware using the agent vulnerability.

Attack Case 1: Management Software A
In November 2015, the first malware to exploit vulnerabilities was found in management software A.
When the malware was executed, the file containing malware was sent to the agent on a specific
IP address. The name of the file used for the management software A vulnerability attack was **
PScan.exe.

Table 1-1 | Attack timeline for malware exploiting A vulnerability

When the ** PScan.exe file is executed on the agent that has received the file, the client PC
becomes infected with malware. Attacks exploiting the vulnerabilities of A, shown in Table 1-1, were
first discovered in November 2015 through to the first half of 2016.

Attack Case 2: Management Software B
Attacks exploiting the vulnerabilities of the management software B have also been discovered
since 2015. The attacks showed various patterns of attacks, and the files such as nc.exe, nt.exe, n5lic.

exe, nc5rt2.exe, and Bin.exe were also found to be used in the attack. It was also discovered to be
downloading VB script files, generated in the names, such as vs1.vbs and winrm.vbs.

The variants of malware used to exploit the vulnerability of B were discovered every year. The
variant found in 2015 generates the winrm.vbs file with the server IP, destination IP, download
address, and remote executable path as arguments.

Figure 1-4 | Management Software B attack tool found in 2017

The variant found in 2016 additionally receives the port number, unlike the 2015 variant, to create
a winrm.vbs file.

The attack tool for management software B discovered most recently was manufactured in 2017
to generate the vs1.vbs file with the target IP, download address, and remote executable path
parameters as shown in Figure 1-4.

The generated VBS script file downloads the file
from the address entered in the parameters. The
downloaded file is in the form of a Windows
executable file, which is not executed because
the first 5 bytes of the file do not exist. At this
time, the code contained in the script recovers
the corresponding 5-byte portion, converts it
into a Window executable to execute malware.
Figure 1-5 shows recovery related code includFigure 1-5 | Generated script code

ed in the script.

Attack Case 3: Management Software C
The attack using the vulnerabilities of the management software C was first found in September
2016. Malware used in this attack performs file transmissions and executions. The attack tool for C is
shown in Figure 1-6.

Conclusion
To prevent targeted attacks that exploit file distribution functions of the central management
software, the policies concerning the management server are crucial. Management servers should

be controlled so that it can only be accessed from the specified system, and the administrator
account of the server should also be changed periodically without storing the login information
in the system. Event logs generated from the management server should always be thoroughly
checked to ensure that abnormal files are not distributed internally.

Annual Report

Security Trends from 2017

2017 was a year full of cyberattacks. Even in this moment, ransomware is indiscriminately
attacking unsuspecting targets with the intent of having the biggest adverse effect. Meanwhile,
other security threats are silently evolving, stronger than ever, in the shadow of ransomware.
AhnLab Security Emergency-response Center(ASEC) lists the key security threats of the year
2017 and their changes.

Three Changes in the Ransomware Paradigm
The top issue for cyber security in 2017 over the world is undoubtedly ransomware. Its
characteristics can be summarized in three: large scale of damage, changes in the routes of
infection, and emergence and termination of variants.

Ransomware hit record high damages in 2017. From WannaCry(also known as WannaCryptor),
which infected more than 300,000 systems in 150 countries, to Bad Rabbit(also known as Disk
Coder), which spread to 15 countries in Europe, the damages are incurred on a world-wide level.

Routes of infections have changed from 2016. While infections using web application
vulnerabilities decreased, infections via email increased a tremendous amount. Locky for

example used emails with attachments containing malicious macros or various types of scripts
adding social engineering techniques to encourage to open the attachments or run the scripts.

In 2017 a new ransomware emerged which was distributed in an unprecedented way.
WannaCry and Petya did not exploit the traditional web application vulnerabilities, nor did
they use spam emails that were surging in 2017, but exploited a vulnerability of the Windows
system. These kinds of attacks had not been reported before and caused an even bigger stir
when it was discovered that the intention was to damage the system and not monetary gain.
The emergence of a ransomware designed simply for destroying systems can be seen as a
major shift in the security paradigm. On the other hand, the ransomware which resulted in the
largest number of infections worldwide, Cerber, seem to have disappeared since the end of
September 2017.

Rise of Supply Chain Attacks
Supply chain attacks have increased in 2017. A supply chain attack is when hackers gain access
to an organization or company's infrastructure to inject malware. Usually, the attacker hacks the
update server of a normal program to inject malware during a normal program update process,
or hacks a software developing company to inject malicious code into the source codes of a
program during a development phase, such as build or deployment.

The attacker understands that security measures are performed on files from external sources,
and so they take advantage of a trusted relationship of internally used software and its files. The
supply chain attack also targets supporting companies, such as maintenance businesses.

ASEC REPORT Vol.89 | Security Trend

The aforementioned Petya Ransomware was distributed via a Ukrainian tax accounting
software. There were also reported cases of where CCleaner was used for distribution. CCleaner
is a widely used network management and system optimization program. Malware was
injected in the program development phase in all of these cases. Other cases include malware
targeting MacOS being injected into video conversion programs, such as HandBrake or Eltima
Player, which were distributed through these program’s official websites in 2017.

Attacks Aimed at Cryptocurrencies
The cryptocurrency(or virtual currency) market bloomed in 2017, which can be obtained
through 'mining' with a computer system. As the value of cryptocurrency skyrocketed, new
mining malware was being discovered where cybercriminals secretly use other users’ PCs to
mine cryptocurrency.

The distribution method of such malware varies, such as disguising as a Windows update
file or a compressed file delivered along with normal files. Moreover, mining malware is now
executable in not only the Windows systems, but also in the Linux server system.

There is also an increase of the direct attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges as the size of
the market has been expanded. The attacks targeting the cryptocurrency exchanges can be
characterized by their extortion of cryptocurrency, extortion of member account information,
and DDoS attacks on cryptocurrency exchange sites.

Rise of Diversified Vulnerability Exploits
Until 2016, web-based attacks using exploit kits were at the center of most security threats.

ASEC REPORT Vol.89 | Security Trend

13

However, there was a significant decrease of attacks using exploits kits in 2017 and thus less
focus on web-based attacks. Instead, the attacks are becoming more sophisticated by targeting
not only one vulnerability, but various types.

In South Korea, there was an attack from China exploiting the Apache Struts2 vulnerability(CVE-2017-5638) amid the political dispute between China and South Korea earlier on in
the year. A number of Microsoft Office documentation vulnerabilities(CVE-2017-0199, CVE2017-8759, CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-11826) identified in 2017, have also been used in
politically motivated attacks as well as for ransomware distribution. Motivation for these
politically charged attacks comes from issues related to North Korea's nuclear tests and the
2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The CVE-2017-0199 is one of the newly discovered
vulnerabilities of Microsoft Office and is known to be used for the distribution of FINSPY, a
malware used in an attack that targeted the Russian government, and WannaCry, the biggest
cyberattack event of 2017.

Due to WannaCry, the vulnerability named EternalBlue(CVE-2017-0144) became very wellknown. WannaCry exploits the Server Message Block(SMB), a protocol used for purposes
such a file sharing, and is specialized for infecting other internal systems by spreading via the
EternalBlue vulnerability. This vulnerability was also exploited in a number of vulnerability
exploit tools publically released by the hacking group known as The Shadow Brokers. Since its
release, the vulnerability was used for distribution by other ransomware, such as Petya. This is
reminiscent of when the Italy based information technology company Hacking Team revealed
their hacked data online, which led to the uncovering of the zero-day exploit in 2016.

Acceleration of Mobile Threats
The numbers of mobile threats has been steadily rising and have become more sophisticated at
a faster pace since 2017.

In the past, malware attempted to induce user downloads of malicious apps via links attached
to spam messages, but from 2017, social engineering attacks frequently appeared. When
installed, the app conducts malicious actions, such as leaking sensitive personal information
stored in the smartphone and blocking outgoing and incoming calls and text messages.

Fake apps are being discovered on Google Play, the official app store of Google. These fake
apps disguise themselves as well-known apps to induce user downloads. Attackers used a very
similar icon and changed the app name or label slightly by adding a special character.

Annual Report

Security Threats in 2018

As we enter 2018, security threats will also enter a new phase as cybercrime groups are
becoming more organized and systematic than ever. Breaches will be bigger, hackers will
be smarter, and security teams and budgets won’t seem to keep pace. AhnLab Security
Emergency-response Center(ASEC) identified the following as some of the bigger security
threats in 2018.

Cybercrime-as-a-Service
2016 was the year that ransomware threats took the limelight and 2017 was the year
when ransomware evolved. Not only did the number of attacks spike, but the number of
ransomware variants flooding the market at
an unprecedented rate reached new heights.
This was all possible due to Ransomware-asa-Service(RaaS). RaaS is being sold widely on
the dark web, allowing novice criminals with
little technological knowledge to launch their
own custom-made ransomware campaigns.

ASEC REPORT Vol.89 | Security Trend

16

As RaaS has become a successful business model in the cybercrime community, Cybercrime-asa-Service(CaaS) is becoming a reality. CaaS today exists as a platform where cybercrime groups
provide role-specific operations, such as sales, distribution, and marketing, just like a legitimate
enterprise. The service is becoming increasingly commercialized in the cybercrime business
world. As cybercrime groups providing these types of businesses are on the rise, an increase in
more diverse cyberattacks is predicted for 2018 with the commercialization of CaaS.

Increasing Supply Chain Attacks
Supply chain attacks will continue their highly
successful attack methods in 2018. The supply
chain attack method seeks to infect systems
during the process of supplying products or
services used by companies or institutions.
This attack exploits the vulnerability that most
companies and institutions trust programs and relates filed already in use while being highly
sensitive to external files from emails or websites. Thus, in the viewpoint of the attacker, it can
be seen that an indirect method of using the target trusted by the victim has a higher success
method than directly attacking companies and institutions that are equipped with various
security systems. Moreover, the attacker can have a bigger control of the network system once
the attack is successful.

Due to these types of attacks, program manufacturers and service providers must take
proactive action to prevent malware infections. And companies and institutions also need to
make a continuous effort to verify and manage internal programs or services in use.

ASEC REPORT Vol.89 | Security Trend

Diversification of Attack Methods
For the past few years, there has been a growth in malware using non-PE files, such as MS
Office documents. These types of attacks
are used to avoid the detection of security
solutions, such as an anti-virus software.
Attacks using non-PE files are expected to
become more sophisticated in 2018.

There will be a rise in malware that executes by using the execution of code inside XML, DDE
features, or object insertions inside the document, which is different from the previous method of
inserting malicious programming into Visual Basic macro codes. Which also means an increase in
fileless attacks where a malware is injected into the process memory for execution rather than the
form of delivery into files already existing in the system.

Expansion of Target Platforms and Devices
Security stakeholders sensitive to the latest
trends of security threats will no longer say that
Linux is a safe operating system. Although it can
be stated that Linux has less malware threats
compared to Windows, but that is not to say
that Linux is invulnerable. It is indeed facing an
increase in threats and variants of the treats.

ASEC REPORT Vol.89 | Security Trend

Last year, a ransomware attack targeted Linux servers of a Korean web hosting company and a
large IDC company, which resulted in huge losses for the companies. And, recently, a malware
appeared that mines cryptocurrency in Linux systems. AhnLab Security Emergency Response
Center(ASEC) has detected 327 Linux malwares in Korea from January to November of 2017.

Similarly to Linux, malware targeting macOS - an operating system that was widely considered
to be safe - is growing continuously. In 2018, malware aiming at Linux, macOS, and Android,
in addition to Windows, is expected to increase. This means that smart devices and IoT devices
that use Linux or Android can also be exposed to security threats.

As IoT devices, such as Robot cleaners, IP cameras and smart refrigerators continue to spread, they
are at an increased risk of malware attacks. ASEC has already discovered Linux.Mirai, one of the
Linux malware programs that targets IoT devices. However, most IoT devices, such as wearable
devices, lack security and security management. With these new changes, it has become clear that
security measures are no longer just for the protection of mobile devices, and effective security
measures must be searched for Internet-connected wearables and home IoT devices.

Increase of Mobile Threats through Official Market
According to StatCounter, a global market survey company, the Android developed by Google
took up 70% of the mobile market in 2017. Due to the high number of people using these
Android-based mobile devices, malware aiming at Android OS is also increasing at a steady
pace. Currently many malicious apps, disguised as legitimate applications, are being discovered
in Google Play Store.

ASEC REPORT Vol.89 | Security Trend

19

As a response, Google announced Google
Play Protect, a protection tool for Google Play
Store users which displays a warning in case
of connecting to an app or a website that has
violated Google's security policy. Despite this
effort, there are no signs of a decline in the
registration of malicious apps in Google Play
Store.

It is likely that malicious apps bypassing the security checks of Google Play Store will continue
to increase in 2018 since the attackers are continuously developing ways to bypass the security
checks of the OS provider.
