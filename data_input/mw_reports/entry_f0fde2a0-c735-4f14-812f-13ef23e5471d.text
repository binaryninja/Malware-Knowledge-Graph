Further TTPs associated with SVR
cyber actors
Use of multiple publicly available exploits and Sliver
framework to target organisations globally

Introduction
This report provides further details of
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
(TTPs) associated with SVR cyber
actors. SVR cyber actors are known
and tracked in open source as APT29,
Cozy Bear, and the Dukes.
UK and US governments recently
attributed SVR’s responsibility for a
series of cyber-attacks, including the

compromise of SolarWinds and the
targeting of COVID-19 vaccine
developers.
Alongside this attribution, the United
States’ National Security Agency
(NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), and Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
released an advisory detailing the
exploits most recently used by the
group. The FBI, Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) and CISA
also issued an alert providing
information on the SVR’s cyber tools,
targets, techniques and capabilities.
The SVR is Russia’s civilian foreign
intelligence service. The group uses a
variety of tools and techniques to
predominantly target overseas
governmental, diplomatic, think-tank,
healthcare and energy targets globally

for intelligence gain. The SVR is a
technologically sophisticated and
highly capable cyber actor. It has
developed capabilities to target
organisations globally, including in the
UK, US, Europe, NATO member
states and Russia’s neighbours.
The NCSC, NSA, CISA and CSE
previously issued a joint report
regarding the group’s targeting of
organisations involved in COVID-19
vaccine development throughout 2020
using WellMess and WellMail
malware.
SVR cyber operators appear to have
reacted to this report by changing their
TTPs in an attempt to avoid further
detection and remediation efforts by
network defenders.
These changes included the
deployment of the open-source tool
Sliver in an attempt to maintain their
accesses.
The group has also been observed
making use of numerous
vulnerabilities, most recently the
widely reported Microsoft Exchange
vulnerability.

Initial access
Further CVEs in use by SVR
As previously reported, the group frequently uses publicly available exploits to
conduct widespread scanning (T1595.002) and exploitation (T1190) against
vulnerable systems. The group seeks to take full advantage of a variety of exploits
when publicised. The group have used:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

CVE-2018-13379 FortiGate
CVE-2019-1653 Cisco router
CVE-2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server
CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra
CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure
CVE-2019-19781 Citrix
CVE-2019-7609 Kibana
CVE-2020-4006 VMWare
CVE-2020-5902 F5 Big-IP
CVE-2020-14882 Oracle WebLogic
CVE-2021-21972 VMWare vSphere

This list should not be treated as exhaustive. The group will look to rapidly exploit
recently released public vulnerabilities which are likely to enable initial access to their
targets. More information about these exploits can be found in previous NCSC
advisories on Citrix and VPN vulnerabilities.

Network defenders should ensure that security patches are applied
promptly following CVE announcements for products they manage.
Most recently, the group has also scanned for Microsoft Exchange servers
vulnerable to CVE-2021-26855. Such activity is typically followed by the use of
further exploits and deployment of a webshell (T1505.003) if successful. Other
Microsoft Exchange exploits commonly used in conjunction with this CVE include:
•
•
•

CVE-2021-26857 (SOAP payload)
CVE-2021-26858 (Arbitrary files)
CVE-2021-27065 (Arbitrary files)

More information about these exploits and mitigation advice can be found on the
NCSC website.

Supply chain compromises
The SolarWinds campaign demonstrates the actor’s willingness to target
organisations that supply privileged software (T1195.002), such as network
management or security applications, to many users or organisations.
These types of attacks give SVR actors initial access to a large number of
organisations. From this initial access, the actors select a much smaller number of
victims for follow-on compromise activity. These victims are targeted in line with
intelligence priorities.
Enterprise products and applications deployed across multiple organisations will be
attractive supply chain targets. Products which require access to a significant portion
of user or network data to operate are likely to be especially attractive targets. Earlier
this year Mimecast and SolarWinds acknowledged compromises, now known to be
conducted by SVR cyber operators.

Post-compromise
Additional malware in use by SVR
NCSC and partner industry analysis shows that on multiple occasions, SVR actors
used Cobalt Strike, a commercial Red Team command and control framework, to
carry out their operations after initial exploitation (e.g. compromise of SolarWinds
platform).
The group also deployed GoldFinder, GoldMax and Sibot malware after
compromising a victim via SolarWinds. GoldMax is a custom backdoor, GoldFinder
is a custom tool – both are written in Golang. Sibot is a simple custom downloader
and, unlike other malware in recent use by the group, is written in VBS (T1059.005).
Microsoft’s analysis of this malware can be found here.
In separate incidents, the NCSC observed that once SVR actors had gained initial
access to a victim’s network, they then made use of the open-source Red Team
command and control framework named Sliver.

The use of the Sliver framework was likely an attempt to ensure
access to a number of the existing WellMess and WellMail victims
was maintained.
Following the publication of the joint WellMess Advisory SVR cyber operators used
the Sliver framework. Sliver is an “…open source, cross-platform adversary

simulation/red team platform…” written in Golang that supports command and
control mechanisms over a variety of protocols including Mutual-TLS (T1573.002),
HTTP/S (T1071.001) and DNS (T1071.004).
The use of the Sliver framework was likely an attempt to ensure access to a number
of the existing WellMess and WellMail victims was maintained following the exposure
of those capabilities. As observed with the SolarWinds incidents, SVR operators
often used separate command and control infrastructure for each victim of Sliver.
SVR actors have used methods other than malware to maintain persistence on high
value targets, including the use of stolen credentials.

Mail server persistence
SVR actors often target administrator mailboxes in order to acquire further network
information and access. This is likely in an effort to better understand the target
network and obtain further privileges or credentials for persistence and/or lateral
movement.
In one example identified by the NCSC, the actor had searched for authentication
credentials in mailboxes, including passwords and PKI keys (T1552).
In another incident, the actor leveraged access gained from the SolarWinds
campaign to compromise a certificate (T1552.004) issued by Mimecast. The actor
used that access to authenticate a subset of Mimecast’s products with customer
systems (T1199). In this way, the actor was able to abuse the Mimecast Azure app
in order to compromise the final target.
The Mimecast Azure application's default application permissions allowed the
application full access to all mailboxes in the victim organisation's tenant. Once the
actor had gained access to this application, they were able to utilise the applications
permissions in order to extract emails from any mailbox used by the victim
organisation (T1114.002). For reference, the default permissions that were granted
to the Mimecast application can be seen below, along with a definition of the
permission:
•
•

“full_access_as_app” under Exchange. This is a highly privileged permission
and allows the app to use Exchange Web services with full access to all
mailboxes.
“User.Read” under Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is an API that allows
custom applications to access Microsoft O365 data and services. This
permission grants the app the ability to read the profile of the signed-in user.

As a result, no further privilege escalation or lateral movement was needed by the
actor to access emails of interest.

Mandiant FireEye has detailed a number of detection and mitigation strategies that
will help organisations proactively harden Microsoft O365 environments against
these techniques. This includes recommendations on how to detect suspicious
modifications in a user’s O365 mailbox permissions.

Conclusion
The SVR targets organisations that align with Russian foreign intelligence interests,
including governmental, think-tank, policy and energy targets, as well as more timebound targeting, for example COVID-19 vaccine targeting in 2020.
Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice and guidance below, as well
as the detection rules in the appendix to help protect against this activity.
Organisations should also follow the advice and guidance in the recently published
NSA advisory and the FBI and CISA alert, which detail further TTPs linked to SVR
cyber actors.

Reporting to the NCSC
UK organisations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected
compromises to the NCSC via the website.

Mitigation advice
•

SVR actors regularly make use of publicly known vulnerabilities (alongside
complex supply chain attacks) to gain initial access onto target networks.
Managing and applying security updates as quickly as possible will help
reduce the attack surface available for SVR actors, and force them to use
higher equity tooling to gain a foothold in the networks.

•

Despite the complexity of supply chain attacks, following basic cyber security
principles will make it harder for even sophisticated actors to compromise
target networks. By implementing good network security controls and
effectively managing user privileges organisations will help prevent lateral
movement between hosts. This will help limit the effectiveness of even
complex attacks. Further NCSC advice is available via the links in the
guidance section below.

•

Detecting supply chain attacks, such as the Mimecast compromise, will
always be difficult. An organisation may be able to detect this sort of activity
through heuristic detection methodologies such as the volume of emails being
accessed or by identifying anomalous IP traffic. However, the actor frequently
uses malicious infrastructure located within the target organisation’s own
country, likely in an effort to frustrate detection efforts.

•

Organisations should ensure sufficient logging (both cloud and on premises)
is enabled and stored for a suitable amount of time, to identify compromised
accounts, exfiltrated material and actor infrastructure. Mail retention and
content policies should also be implemented to reduce the amount of
sensitive information available upon successful compromise. Particularly
sensitive information, including information relating to network architecture
and network security, should be safeguarded appropriately.

•

As part of Microsoft's 'Advanced Auditing' functionality, Microsoft have
introduced a new mailbox auditing action called 'MailItemsAccessed' which
helps with investigating the compromise of email accounts. This is part of
Exchange mailbox auditing and is enabled by default for users that are
assigned an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5 license or for organisations with a
Microsoft 365 E5 compliance add-on subscription.

•

With ‘MailItemsAccessed’ enabled, administrators are able to identify almost
every single email accessed by a user, giving organisations forensic
defensibility to help assert which individual pieces of mail were or were not
maliciously accessed by an attacker.

Further guidance
A variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the campaigns detailed in this
report:
•

Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the latest
supported versions, apply security patches promptly, use anti-virus and scan
regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware.

•

Use multi-factor authentication (/2-factor authentication/two-step
authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See NCSC
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-onlineservices and https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication2fa

•

Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report suspected
phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports
promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening
attachments. See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing

•

Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be
needed to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC
Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-securitypurposes.

•

Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organisation’s networks. See
NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement

Appendix
Snort rules
Sliver HTTP request URLs are procedurally generated according to a
set pattern, as per the implant/sliver/transports/tcp-http.go file.
•
•
•
•
•

The resource file extension defines the beacon type.
A random number generator decides whether to include a parent
folder in the URL path.
The parent folder and resource filename are randomly chosen
from predefined lists per beacon type.
The URL query parameter underscore _ is a numeric value which
specifies the payload encoding format.
Results can be further filtered by User-Agent, Accept-Language
and PHPSESSID Cookie headers.

YARA Rules
The following Yara rules will aid network defenders in
detecting Sliver. It should be noted that other frameworks may
rely on code from the Sliver project (e.g. WireGost). Sliver
is also used to conduct legitimate pen-testing activity.
Therefore a Sliver detection does not necessarily indicate a
compromise by APT29.
