Cyberespionage operation targets Android users in the Middle East
ZooPark is a cyberespionage operation that has been focusing on Middle Eastern targets
since at least June 2015. The threat actors behind the operation infect Android devices using
several generations of malware, with the attackers including new features in each iteration.
We label them from v1-v4, with v4 being the most recent version deployed in 2017. From the
technical point of view, the evolution of ZooPark has shown notable progress: from the very
basic first and second versions, the commercial spyware fork in its third version and then to
the complex spyware that is version 4. This last step is especially interesting, showing a big
leap from straightforward code functionality to highly sophisticated malware.

Evolution of ZooPark malware features

We have observed two main distribution vectors for ZooPark – Telegram channels and
watering holes. The second one was the preferred vector: we found several news websites
that have been hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site that serves
malicious APKs. Some of the themes observed in campaign include “Kurdistan referendum”,
“TelegramGroups” and “Alnaharegypt news”, among others.

Target profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran.

cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
