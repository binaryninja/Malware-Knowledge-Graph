Way back in 2013 our malware analysts spotted the first malicious samples related to the TrojanRansom.Win32.Rakhni family. That was the starting point for this long-lived Trojan family, which is still
functioning to this day. During that time the malware writers have changed:
the way their Trojans get keys (from locally generated to received from the C&C);
the algorithms used (from using only a symmetric algorithm, through a commonly used scheme of
symmetric + asymmetric, to 18 symmetric algorithms used simultaneously);
the crypto-libraries (LockBox, AESLib, DCPcrypt);
the distribution method (from spam to remote execution).

Now the criminals have decided to add a new feature to their creation – a mining capability. In this article
we describe a downloader that decides how to infect the victim: with a cryptor or with a miner.

Infection vector
As far as we know, spam campaigns are still the main way of distributing this malware.

2/16

Email with malicious attachment

After opening the email attachment, the victim is prompted to save the document and enable editing.

Attached Word document

The victim is expected to double-click on the embedded PDF file. But instead of opening a PDF the victim
launches a malicious executable.

Downloader
General information
The downloader is an executable file written in Delphi. To complicate analysis, all strings inside the
malware are encrypted with a simple substitution cipher.
After execution, the downloader displays a message box with an error text. The purpose of this message
is to explain to the victim why no PDF file opened.

Fake error message

To hide the presence of the malicious software in the system the malware developer made their creation
look like the products of Adobe Systems. This is reflected in the icon, the name of the executable file and
the fake digital signature that uses the name Adobe Systems Incorporated. In addition, before installing
the payload the downloader sends an HTTP request to the address www.adobe.com.

Environment checks
4/16

After the message box is closed the malware performs a number of checks on the infected machine:
Self path check
The name should contain the substring AdobeReader
The path should contain one of the following substrings:
\TEMP
\TMP
\STARTUP
\CONTENT.IE
Registry check
Checks that in the registry there is no value HKCU\Software\Adobe\DAVersion and, if so, the malware
creates the value HKCU\Software\Adobe\DAVersion = True and continues its work
Running processes check
Checks that the count of running processes is greater than 26
Checks that none of the processes listed in the table below are present.

If at least one of the performed checks fails, the downloader ends the process.

Installation of certificates
The downloader installs a root certificate that’s stored in its resources. All downloaded malicious
executables are signed with this certificate. We have found fake certificates that claim to have been issued
by Microsoft Corporation and Adobe Systems Incorporated.

7/16

Fake Microsoft Corporation certificate

8/16

Fake Adobe Systems Incorporated certificate

Certificates are installed using the standard utility CertMgr.exe that’s also stored in the downloader’s
resources.

Resources contained in the downloader executable file

Before installing the certificate, the downloader drops the necessary files from the resources to the
%TEMP% directory.

Fake certificate and CertMgr.exe utility

It then executes the following command:
CertMgr.exe -add -c 179mqn7h0c.cer -s -r localMachine root

The main decision
The decision to download the cryptor or the miner depends on the presence of the folder
%AppData%\Bitcoin. If the folder exists, the downloader decides to download the cryptor. If the folder
doesn’t exist and the machine has more than two logical processors, the miner will be downloaded. If
there’s no folder and just one logical processor, the downloader jumps to its worm component, which is
described below in the corresponding part of the article.
Cryptor decision
The Trojan downloads a password-protected archive that contains a cryptor module. The archive will be
downloaded to the startup directory (C:\Documents and Settings\username\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
and then the downloader will unpack it using the command line WinRAR tool. The cryptor executable will
have the name taskhost.exe.
After execution, the cryptor performs an environment check like the installer; in addition, it will check that
it’s running after the downloader decision (by checking the registry value
HKCU\Software\Adobe\DAVersion is present).
Interestingly, the cryptor only starts working if the system has been idle for at least two minutes. Before
encrypting files, the cryptor terminates the following processes:

In addition, if there is no avp.exe process running, the cryptor removes volume shadow copies.
The cryptor encrypts files with the following extensions:
“.ebd”, “.jbc”, “.pst”, “.ost”, “.tib”, “.tbk”, “.bak”, “.bac”, “.abk”, “.as4”, “.asd”, “.ashbak”, “.backup”, “.bck”,
“.bdb”, “.bk1”, “.bkc”, “.bkf”, “.bkp”, “.boe”, “.bpa”, “.bpd”, “.bup”, “.cmb”, “.fbf”, “.fbw”, “.fh”, “.ful”, “.gho”,

“.prefab”, “.jif”, “.wor”, “.csv”, “.msg”, “.msf”, “.kwm”, “.pwm”, “.ai”, “.eps”, “.abd”, “.repx”, “.oxps”, “.dot”.
After encryption the file extension will be changed to .neitrino.
Files are encrypted using an RSA-1024 encryption algorithm. The information necessary to decrypt the
files is sent to the attacker by email.
In each encrypted directory, the cryptor creates a MESSAGE.txt file with the following contents:

11/16

Ransom note

Miner decision
The downloading process of the miner is the same except for the downloading folder – the miner is saved
to the path %AppData%\KB<8_random_chars>, where <8_random_chars>, as the name suggests, is a
string constructed from alphanumeric characters [0-9a-z].
After downloading and unpacking the archive with the miner, the Trojan does the following:
Firstly, it generates a VBS script that will be launched after an OS reboot. The script has the name
Check_Updates.vbs. This script contains two commands for mining:
the first command will start a process to mine the cryptocurrency Monero;
the second command will start a process to mine the cryptocurrency Monero Original. The
name of the subfolder where the executable should be located (cuda) may indicate that this
executable will use the GPU power for mining.

Content of the Check_Updates.vbs file

Then, if there is a file named %AppData%\KB<8_random_chars>\svchost.exe, the Trojan executes it
to mine the cryptocurrency Dashcoin.

Process for mining the Dashcoin cryptocurrency

12/16

When this analysis was carried out, the downloader was receiving an archive with a miner that didn’t use
the GPU. The attacker uses the console version of the MinerGate utility for mining.

Checking the utility for mining

In order to disguise the miner as a trusted process, the attacker signs it with a fake Microsoft Corporation
certificate and calls svchost.exe.

Disabling of Windows Defender
Regardless of whether the cryptor or the miner was chosen, the downloader checks if one of the following
AV processes is launched:
360DocProtect.exe

avgui.exe

dwservice.exe

McUICnt.exe

360webshield.exe

avgwdsvc.exe

dwwatcher.exe

spideragent.exe

avgrsx.exe

dwengine.exe

mcshield.exe

SymCorpUI.exe

avguard.exe

dwnetfilter.exe

McSvHost.exe

If no AV process was found in the system, the Trojan will run several cmd commands that will disable
Windows Defender in the system:
cmd /C powershell Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
cmd /C powershell Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting 0
cmd /C powershell Set-MpPreference -SubmitSamplesConsent 2
taskkill /IM MSASCuiL.exe

cmd /C REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration /v
NotificationSuppress /t REGDWORD /d 1 /f

Sending the statistics
During their operation the downloader and cryptor modules send emails with statistics to a hardcoded
address. These messages contain information about the current state of infection and other details such
as:
computer name;
victim IP address;
path of malware in the system;
current date and time;
malware build date.
The downloader sends the following states:
Hello Install

Sent after the cryptor or miner is downloaded

Hello NTWRK

Sent after the downloader attempts to spread through the victim’s network

Error

Sent if something goes wrong and contains the error code value

The cryptor sends the following states:
Locked

Shows that the cryptor was launched

Final

Shows that the cryptor has ended the encryption process

Another interesting fact is that the downloader also has some spyware functionality – its messages include
a list of running processes and an attachment with a screenshot.

Worm component

14/16

As one of its last actions the downloader tries to copy itself to all the computers in the local network. To do
so, it calls the system command ‘net view /all’ which will return all the shares and then the Trojan creates
the list.log file containing the names of computers with shared resources. For each computer listed in the
file the Trojan checks if the folder Users is shared and, if so, the malware copies itself to the folder
\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup of each accessible user.

Self-deleting
Before shutting down the malware creates a batch file that deletes all ‘temporary’ files created during the
infection process. This is a common practice for malware. The thing that interested us was the use of the
Goto label ‘malner’. Perhaps this is a portmanteau of the words ‘malware’ and ‘miner’ used by the criminal.
