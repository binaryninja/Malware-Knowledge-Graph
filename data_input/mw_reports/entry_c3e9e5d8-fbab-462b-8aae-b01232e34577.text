REvil/Sodinokibi

REvil Ransomware as a Service
§ First seen May 2019
§ Operated by UNKN
§ Affiliate model:
– Multiple threat actors use the REvil RaaS
– Affiliates are vetted and buy in
– Affiliates receive 60% - 75% of payouts depending on
performance

8

REvil Ransomware as a Service
§ Each affiliate gains access to the RaaS platform:
– Malware generation
– Ransom demands and payment service
– Victim communications
– Coin laundering

Sodinokibi Ransomware
§ On the most part, ransomed systems remain
functional

– System-related file extensions and directories are
untouched

§ To date, no issues found in crypto
§ Each infected system has a unique private key:
– Encrypted and stored in registry
– Decrypted with attacker key

10

Time to Ransomware Deployment
§ It depends on the affiliate
§ For comprehensive domain-wide ransomware
deployment:

– Up to three to four months
– Some affiliates appear to have a backlog of victims

If you will not cooperate with our service - for us, its does not matter. But you
will lose your time and data, cause just we have the private key. In practice time is much more valuable than money.

Partnership Model
§ QAKBOT initially deployed as a banking trojan
§ In 2020, the partnership model is seen
– Ransomware developers are provided access to
a compromised environment with QAKBOT
– Negotiations for payment are handled by the
ransomware developers themselves

utilising unsophisticated phishing campaigns

QAKBOT
§ QAKBOT is a modular backdoor which allows
an attacker to select the capabilities
required and upload through the default
configuration

Modules
Email Staging

Cobalt Strike

Web Injects

31

©2020 FireEye

Email Staging Module
§ The email module is a standalone binary,

Modules
Email Staging

independent from other QAKBOT modules

§ The module creates a directory for email staging,
and utilises MAPI connections to a local outlook
instance
– %USERPROFILE%\EmailStorage_<computer_name><username>_<timestamp>

§ Collected data is sent to a hard coded C2 with the
data ZLIB compressed and base64 encoded

32

©2020 FireEye

Cobalt Strike

Web Injects

Cobalt Strike Module
§ QAKBOT can load Cobalt Strike in two ways

Modules
Email Staging

– Arbitrary Downloads
§ The attackers can push the Cobalt Strike loader as

Cobalt Strike

a file and execute locally

– Custom module
§ The Cobalt Strike module can be configured to

load a pre-configured DLL which downloads and
executes the Cobalt Strike payload

33

©2020 FireEye

Web Injects

Web Inject Module
§ The module works by injecting the contents of the

Modules
Email Staging

below file into explorer.exe

– <install_path>\webinjects.cb

§ The module iterates through a list of pre-configured

Cobalt Strike

sites and injects JavaScript elements

§ Targeting appears related to Northern American
organisations, as exampled below

34

Web Injects

DOPPELPAYMER
§ In early 2020, the following delivery mechanisms
were seen

– Group Policies
§ Binaries placed in SYSVOL locations and deployed

across the domain using scripts
– PsExec
– BITS Jobs
– Scheduled Tasks

35

Four stage process
from delivery of
ransomware binary to
encryption of files

Stage 1
§ The DOPPELPAYMER variant enumerates all users for the local
system and changes the password

§ The password is generated with a pre-configured string and
an MD5 hash of the computer name
– Preconfigured string: TtXtE9n3
– Computer name hash: 384DFCCEE8DB9F89ED2859E3F32F6AF5
– Full password: TtXtE9n3&384DFCCEE8DB9F89ED2859E3F32F6AF5

36

©2020 FireEye

1. Enumerates all
users and changes
password

Stage 2

1. Enumerates all
users and changes
password

§ The ransomware copies a legitimate service and replaces
the original with a copy of itself
– File: <random>.exe
§ Path: %APPDATA%\<random>.exe
§ Note: Copy of DOPPELPAYMER binary

– Service: <random_service>
§ Path: %WINDIR%\system32\<random_service>.exe
§ Note: Ransomware Service

– Service: <random_service>-1
§ Path: %WINDIR%\system32\<random_service>.exe-1
§ Note: Backup of Service

37

©2020 FireEye

2. Registers the
ransomware as a
service

Stage 3

1. Enumerates all
users and changes
password

§ The Boot Configuration database is altered
– recoveryenabled: no
§ Startup repair is disabled

– safeboot: minimal

2. Registers the
ransomware as a
service

§ Ransomware service is started in safeboot

– Group policy configured to display a ransom message prior to login

38

©2020 FireEye

3. Changes Boot
Configuration
Database

Stage 4

1. Enumerates all
users and changes
password

§ After rebooting, the DOPPELPAYMER variant will begin
encrypting files on the system.
– <filename>.doppeled
– <filename>.how2decrypt.txt

2. Registers the
ransomware as a
service

3. Changes Boot
Configuration
Database

4. Reboots the
system and
encrypts files
39

©2020 FireEye

Takeaway
§ Highly effective
– QAKBOT has been around for a long time

§ High impact
– DOPPELPAYMER removes access to systems

§ Highly active
– As many as an organisation a day in periods of
2020

40

Conclusion

A Continuing Problem
§ Everything is increasing:
– Payouts
– Number of victims
– Damage to organisations
– Extortion for stolen data

§ With so much profit, so many victims, the only trend is
upwards
§ Ransomware is now a boardroom risk

42

©2020 FireEye

Improvements to Tradecraft
§ More stealth, less noise
– Ransomware engagements are fast, but they’re loud

§ Tooling improvements

– Less reliance on standard penetration testing tools
– More bespoke malware

§ Faster to domain admin
§ Improved ransomware deployment methods
§ Increased effectiveness to delete backups

43

©2020 FireEye

What’s Next?
§ Continued focus on mass exploitation of edgedevices
§ Limiting factors for the attackers:
– Too many victims
– Not enough operators

§ No downwards pressure until law enforcement
intervention

– The best organisations can do is to:
§ improve security
§ improve resilience
