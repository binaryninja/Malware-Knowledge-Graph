Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Inve
the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N
government. This malware variant has been identified as CROWDEDFLOUNDER. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the
government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activi
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI C
(CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report analyzes a Themida packed 32-bit Windows executable, which is designed to unpack and execute a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) bin
application is designed to accept arguments during execution or can be installed as a service with command line arguments. It is designed to liste
incoming connections containing commands or can connect to a remote server to receive commands.

Description

This application is a Themida packed 32-bit Windows executable, which is designed to unpack and execute a RAT binary in memory. This applica
accept arguments during execution or can be installed as a service with command line arguments. When executed, the application is designed to
Firewall on the victim’s machine to allow for incoming and outgoing connections from the victim system. The firewall is modified using a "netsh fire
portopening" command (Figure 2). Static analysis indicates this malware may be utilized to listen as a proxy for incoming connections containing c
connect to a remote server to receive commands. The following command line arguments are utilized to control the RAT functionality:
--Begin RAT command line arguments--p: You can use the -p command line argument to force the malware to listen on a specific port. Example: malware.exe -p 8888
-h: You can use the -h CLI to force the malware to connect to a remote host and port. Example: malware.exe -h <url_string>:8888
Note: <url_string> can be either a fully qualified domain name or an Internet Protocol (IP) address.
--End RAT command line arguments-The RAT uses a rotating exclusive or (XOR) cryptographic algorithm to secure its data transfers and command-and-control (C2) sessions (Figure
designed to accept instructions from the remote server to perform the following functions:
2/5

--Begin functions performed by the malware-Download and upload files
Execute secondary payloads
Execute shell commands
Terminate running processes
Delete files
Search files
Set file attributes
Collect device information from installed storage devices (disk free space and their type)
List running processes information
Collect and send information about the victim's system
Securely download malicious DLLs and inject them into remote processes
--End functions performed by the malware-The -h argument is utilized to force the RAT to connect to a C2 server and the CURL library (Version 7.49.1) will be used for data transfers. Note:
cipher will be used to secure all C2 traffic sent and received from the external C2 server. Although the malware appears to expect a numeric IP ad
argument, it will also accept a string Uniform Resource Locator (URL) value. If a URL string is provided (i.e. domain.com) the malware will then qu
using the Win32 API getaddrinfo(). If this call succeeds, an IP address will be returned and the malware will attempt to connect to that IP address.
getaddrinfo() fails the malware will hash this domain using the MD5 hashing algorithm, resulting in a 16 byte hash value. The malware will then ta
of this hash value and XOR them with a four byte value. The resultant four byte value will then be treated as a numeric IP address. The malware w
connect to this newly generated IP address. Note: all of the command line executables referenced within this product generate and connect to an
generated from the provided URL string if the call to getaddrinfo() against the provided URL fails.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
