Last year was a busy year for malvertising with top rank ad networks such as Google’s
DoubleClick caught in large scale attacks, and popular sites unwillingly infecting their visitors
because of malicious advertisements.
And 2015 is getting off to a rough start as well.
As Nick Bilogorskiy from Cyphort reported earlier this week, a campaign has been wreaking
havoc on sites generating much Internet traffic.
These attacks are the work of the Kovter gang which has been busy hitting major other
players (ie. YouTube) during the past year. We tracked this particular campaign as well and
have observed several high level domains being victim of malvertising with a combined
monthly traffic of 1.5 billion visitors.

Sweet Orange landing page source code

The vulnerability exploited was CVE-2014-6332 and Internet Explorer was the target.
Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit blocks this attack:

Payload
The payload, Kovter, gets dropped in the Temp folder:
“C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Temp\repfix.exe”
The payload is VM aware and also looks for debugging and other security tools. One way to
know if the sample properly ran is whether it deletes itself after execution or not.
VM or security tools on a real PC:
Sample does not delete itself
POST request (domain may change) in this format: (a16-kite.pw/form2.php):

4/7

Real machine, no security tools:
Sample deletes itself
POST request (domain may change) in this format: a16.car.biz/11/form.php
We analyzed this in a real environment using Wireshark on an external laptop to make this
completely transparent to the malware. That allowed us to see what it really is: Ad Fraud
(and not ransomware as reported earlier by other sites)

Shortly after, the flood of ad fraud requests begins:

Ad fraud, or also click fraud, account for a large part of the billion dollar ad industry. Ad fraud
malware essentially simulates the user visiting pages with adverts as if they were legitimate
views.
All these requests are made in the background and game the system while the victim is none
the wiser.
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware already detects and blocks this threat:

Malvertising to remain one of the top threats in 2015
As we had said it in our end of year report, malvertising is a huge issue that affects a wide
range of people. End users, of course, but also advertisers and publishers who have to fight
to defend their legitimacy.
Cyber criminals will likely continue to hijack ad networks with malicious code and pocket the
dividends from hundreds of thousands of successful infections.
6/7

This particular campaign is likely to migrate to other controllers or evolve into something else
since it is now in the public domain and affected parties are cleaning up and securing their
systems.
Malwarebytes Labs will continue to monitor the situation and update you on any new
developments.
Special thanks to JP Taggart for providing the external recording system.
