Revealing REvil Ransomware With DomainTools and
Maltego

Looking at a Recent REvil (AKA Sodinokibi) Ransomware Indicator
Set in Maltego Using the DomainTools Transforms
According to a recent report by Symantec Enterprise Security, the REvil ransomware
operators have been seen leveraging Cobalt Strike and scanning for vulnerable Point-ofSale systems. The attackers are utilizing a mixture of AWS CloudFront for C2 and Pastebin
for storing their payloads. Leveraging legitimate services here makes it difficult for incident
responders to react as any number of things may rapidly shift as infrastructure can be
quickly spun up, torn down, and modified on cloud services with a host of modern
configuration management tooling. However, the report included three IP addresses that
can be investigated to provide more insight. With ransomware on the rise again, it’s
important to do proper due diligence to see what else one can discover behind this single
instance. I’ll do so by leveraging the DomainTools data set and Maltego to visually map out
my research.
First, the domains and IP addresses released in the report were:
102.129.224[.]148

23.81.143[.]21
5.101.0[.]202

Although not directly mentioned in the report, it is helpful to time gate when this attack
occurred to limit the scope of research. Since cloud services can shift at any moment (and
indeed that CloudFront address for instance has had hundreds of allocations since January
2020), placing a barrier around the research will help separate signals from noise. As this
report was released in late June 2020, I’m going to assume that the attacks took place after
April of 2020. The reason I’m choosing this date is due to a bit of domain knowledge as a
security professional: there are multiple reports that came out during the height of COVID19 that indicated the group behind REvil were leveraging COVID-19-themed lures and
attacking medical infrastructure with great effect. I can make an educated guess that at
least one associate has shifted their targets now that the effectiveness of those lures is
drying up.
An additional note before I begin: REvil samples usually contain thousands of domains
used for C2, many unregistered and suspected decoys. The group is advanced in that there
are a swath of methods used for exploiting victims and moving laterally in victim’s networks
with more than a dozen tools used to do so. They adapt their techniques for each
organization they attack and evolve with each unique campaign. If you are looking to track
REvil beyond understanding a single campaign event then I would suggest reading KPN’s
excellent write-up on tracking the group across hundreds of individual campaigns. If you are
looking for a write-up of how a singular sample works I cannot recommend McAfee’s
analysis enough.

Investigating with Iris and Maltego
So to start, I’ll import these four entities from the report into Maltego. The paste function
does a good job here of figuring out what types of entities these are.

From there I’ll run a reverse lookup, marked under the DomainTools Iris transforms as “IP
Address to Domain” to get several domains to begin our searching.

From a quick look at the entity details brought in from the Iris transforms I noticed that the
domains in the CN TLD are all from 2016 and before. Since I’m time gating our investigation
I’ll take a look at just the doomvoid[.]com domain then. Running that through the Farsight

3/6

Passive DNS transform, I get a number of suspicious domains that fall within the time
constraints.

The fact that this domain is running its own nameservers is suspicious enough with how
often nameservers are now used for C2 signaling. The vedit-setfacl is interesting as that
references in setfacl a Linux command used to set file access control lists and seems an
odd error or perhaps a command mistype that ended up being picked up by a recursive
resolver’s passive DNS sensor. Outside of those, both the abelian-don and mil-monstrous
subdomains seem the most suspicious. Polling Farsight again for A records linked to those
subdomains, I get two new IP addresses for this investigation.

4/6

Out of those two new addresses, the only one that returns any additional context in our time
frame is the 5[.]101[.]0[.]206 address which I can pull a domain vila[.]website from using the
Iris Investigate transform once again. This site, registered in May of 2020 through reg.ru
had a DomainTools Risk score of 93 out of 99 with a high chance of malware. This
algorithm takes into account nearby domains, infrastructure this domain sits on, and its
history to determine the likelihood of its potential for maliciousness. 93 is considered a very
high likelihood from the DomainTools machine learning classifiers. This may be in part due
to the IP addresses associated existing on the Petersburg Internet Network, a Russiabased ISP located in Saint Petersburg from which malicious traffic has been observed in
the past. Knowing that the REvil group is suspected to be Russia based, the high likelihood
of malicious traffic from this network, and our timeframe I can do a search for all Farsight
Passive DNS query sets in that time frame for a[.]vila[.]website and I’ll get back four IPs in
total.
5/6

5.8.54[.]52
5.101.0[.]206
5.8.55[.]43
5.101.6[.]227
From here, outside of these IP addresses being on the same network as our original
indicators, unfortunately, I cannot do much more to tie these to additional indicators or past
reports. From this point, I can see that all of the IPs were likely linked during the same
timeframe, but all there is left to do is monitor for maliciousness.
With each REvil associate and attack being well contained and with some instances being
hosted on constantly shifting cloud infrastructure it’s important to become adept at mapping
out an attack as quickly as possible in some visual form that can be passed along to
leadership. Leveraging Maltego, the Iris Investigate transform, and other transforms at my
disposal I can rapidly build out a report in Maltego for export.
