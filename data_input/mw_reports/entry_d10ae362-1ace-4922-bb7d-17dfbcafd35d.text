A cyber-criminal group believed to be operating out of Russian-speaking territories has hit
at least 20 banks and financial companies and stolen millions of US dollars in the process.
Details of these attacks were first made public in a report published yesterday by Russian
cyber-security firm Group-IB. The company believes this is a new group, different from other
advanced criminal organizations that have hit the financial sector in the past, like the
Carbanak, Cobalt, and Lazarus Group operations.
Researchers named this new group MoneyTaker, based on the name attackers gave to one
of their hacking utilities.

MoneyTaker group began operations in 2016
According to Group-IB, MoneyTaker has started operations sometimes in 2016, hitting its
first target —a Florida bank— in May 2016.
Since then, the group has hit 14 US banks, a US services provider, a UK company, 3
Russian banks, and one Russian law firm.

The attacks that hit banks have focused on infiltrating inter-banking money transfer and
card processing systems such as the First Data STAR Network and the Russian Central
Bank's AWS CBR system.
Attackers infiltrated one computer, then spread laterally, gathering any files and credentials
they could, hoping to compromise a PC with access to the STAR or CBR networks.

Attackers studied bank networks by stealing documentation files
Evidence collected by Group-IB suggests attackers intentionally searched and stole internal
documentation files to learn about bank operations in preparation for future attacks.
In some cases, attackers also stole documents on SWIFT, another inter-banking money
transfer system, and files on OceanSystems’ FedLink, a card processing system widely
deployed across Latin America.

Now, experts believe Latin America banks and banks utilizing the SWIFT system are in
MoneyTaker's crosshairs. The SWIFT team issued a report last month with
recommendations on how banks could improve their security.

Attackers used fileless malware, legitimate apps
As for the "hacking" part of the MoneyTaker attacks, Group-IB said the hackers' activity was
very hard to investigate.
Attackers used common and legitimate apps to carry out malicious operations and used a
wide arsenal of malware families. Each hack was different, showing that the group studied
each target in fine detail and deployed only tools appropriate for those targets.
The hackers never focused on one bank system alone, and stole money from card
processing systems, from ATM networks, and even installed POS (Point-of-Sale) trojans
when the hacked organizations weren't financial institutions and had no connection to a
large inter-banking network.
According to Group-IB, the group used the MoneyTaker malware framework to hijack interbanking and card processing operations, the ScanPOS malware for POS systems, custom
screenshoting and keylogging tools and the Citadel and Kronos banking trojans to move
laterally inside networks. The table below shows tools used by MoneyTaker during their
attacks.

In addition, MoneyTaker also used SSL certificates generated in the name of big brands to
sign their malware, used one-time Yandex and Mail.ru email accounts, and employed the
overdraft technique for cashing stolen funds with the help of money mules.

Further, the hackers also took the time to delete their entry points, as Group-IB was not able
to find the initial infection vector, and used a unique command-and-control server
infrastructure that did not deploy any malware unless the download request came from a
targeted bank's IP address range.
Group-IB investigators said they forwarded all the data they gather on this group to Europol
and Interpol, as they suspect this will not be the last time we hear about MoneyTaker's
operations.
