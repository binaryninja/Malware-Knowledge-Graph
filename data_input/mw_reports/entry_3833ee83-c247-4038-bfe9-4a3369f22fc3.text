Threat Hunter TeamSymantec
A distinct group of espionage attackers who were formerly associated with the ShadowPad
remote access Trojan (RAT) has adopted a new, diverse toolset to mount an ongoing
campaign against a range of government and state-owned organizations in a number of
Asian countries. The attacks, which have been underway since at least early 2021, appear to
have intelligence gathering as their main goal.

Targets
The current campaign appears to be almost exclusively focused on government or public
entities, including:
Head of government/Prime Minister’s Office
Government institutions linked to finance

Government-owned aerospace and defense companies
State-owned telecoms companies
State-owned IT organizations
State-owned media companies

Tools
A notable feature of these attacks is that the attackers leverage a wide range of legitimate
software packages in order to load their malware payloads using a technique known as DLL
side-loading. Usually, the attackers used multiple software packages in a single attack. In
many cases, old and outdated versions of software are used, including security software,
graphics software, and web browsers. In some cases, legitimate system files from the legacy
operating system Windows XP are used. The reason for using outdated versions is that most
current versions of the software used would have mitigation against side-loading built-in.
DLL side-loading is a well-known technique that involves attackers placing a malicious DLL
in a directory where a legitimate DLL is expected to be found. The attacker then runs the
legitimate application themselves (having installed it themselves in most cases). The
legitimate application then loads and executes the payload.
Once a malicious DLL is loaded by the attackers, malicious code is executed, which in turn
loads a .dat file. This file contains arbitrary shellcode that is used to execute a variety of
payloads and associated commands in memory. In some cases, the arbitrary shellcode is
encrypted.
The attackers also leverage these legitimate software packages to deploy additional tools,
which are used to further aid in lateral movement. These tools include credential dumping
tools, a number of network scanning tools (NBTScan, TCPing, FastReverseProxy, and
FScan), and the Ladon penetration testing framework.
Attacks usually unfold in the following manner:
Once backdoor access is gained, the attackers use Mimikatz and ProcDump to steal
credentials. In some cases, the attackers dump credentials via the registry.
They then use network scanning tools to identify other computers of interest, such as
those running RDP, which could facilitate lateral movement.
They leverage PsExec to run old versions of legitimate software, which are then used
to load additional malware tools such as off-the-shelf RATS via DLL side-loading on
other computers on the networks.
The attackers also use a number of living-off-the-land tools such as Ntdsutil to mount
snapshots of Active Directory servers in order to gain access to Active Directory
databases and log files. The Dnscmd command line tool is also used to enumerate
network zone information.

Case Study: An unfolding attack
In April 2022, the attackers targeted a government-owned organization in the education
sector in Asia and managed to stay on its network until July. During the period of the
compromise, the attackers accessed computers hosting databases and emails and
eventually made their way to the domain controller.
The first sign of malicious activity occurred on April 23, when a malicious command was
executed via imjpuex.exe (SHA256:
fb5bc4baece5c3ab3dabf84f8597bed3c3f2997336c85c84fdf4beba2dcb700f). The file
imjputyc.exe is a legitimate Windows XP file that was used by the attackers to side-load a
malicious DLL file (imjputyc.dll), which in turn was used to load a .dat file (payload imjputyc.dat). Following this activity, imjputyc.exe was used to launch a network service via
svchost.exe, likely created by the malicious payload.
CSIDL_SYSTEMX86\svchost.exe NetworkService 7932
Additionally, around the same time, the attackers leveraged Imjpuex.exe to install and
execute an eleven-year-old version of Bitdefender Crash Handler (file name: javac.exe,
SHA256: 386eb7aa33c76ce671d6685f79512597f1fab28ea46c8ec7d89e58340081e2bd).
While Crash Handler was used for side-loading in this attack, it is just one of many old
versions of applications that have been used by this group in recent months.
The same Crash Handler executable was copied to
CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\xampp\tmp\vmware.exe and executed.
The attackers then installed and executed ProcDump in order to dump credentials from the
Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS):
p.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass2.dmp
The attackers then launched several command prompts while reloading Crash Handler. This
was likely done in order to install additional tools.
Shortly afterwards, a file called calc.exe (SHA256:
912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9) appeared on
the machine and was executed by the attackers. This was a renamed version of Mimikatz
that the attackers then used to dump credentials:
calc.exe ""privilege::debug"" ""sekurlsa::logonpasswords full" " exit "
On April 26, further malicious activity occurred when the attackers ran the Crash Handler
executable and installed a file called cal.exe (SHA256:
12534f7014b3338d8f9f86ff1bbeacf8c80ad03f1d0d19077ff0e406c58b5133) on the
compromised machine.
3/10

This file was LadonGo v3.8, a publicly available penetration testing framework that is written
in Go. The attackers appear to have used LadonGo to scan the internal network for
machines with RDP services running and attempted to exploit or log in to those machines
using the credentials they stole several days earlier. There was also some evidence of bruteforce login attempts against machines of interest.
On May 6, the attackers resumed their attack and ran the Crash Handler executable (this
time named svchost.exe) and installed a new variant of Mimikatz named test.exe (SHA256:
912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9). This was
likely done in order to obtain more credentials. The attackers then ran LadonGo and
attempted to exploit a Netlogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) against two other computers
in the organization in order to elevate privileges.
On May 16, the attackers increased their level of activity and began moving laterally across
the organization’s network from the initially compromised computer (Computer #1).
On a second computer (Computer #2), the attackers launched a command prompt and
executed a variant of Mimikatz (file name: test.exe, SHA256:
912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9). The
attackers then deployed a number of Knowledge Base files (e.g. kb0394623.exe) on the
computer. These files are legitimate copies of the Windows command prompt (with 16 bytes
of the rich header modified).
On a third computer (Computer #3) the attackers used PsExec to execute the same older
version of Crash Handler used on Computer #1, this time named javac.exe. A copy of this
executable was then made to csidl_program_files\windows mail\winmailservice.exe and was
executed.
The attackers then ran dnscmd.exe (SHA256:
67877821bf1574060f4e45ab8be62e28f54fb40a23ce70b86a6369a4d63db5bc), which was
used to enumerate DNS configuration information on the compromised computer:
Dnscmd . /EnumZones
Dnscmd is a Microsoft command-line tool for managing DNS servers. It can be used to script
batch files to help automate routine DNS management tasks or to perform routine setup of
new DNS servers. The enumzones command is used to list the zones that exist on the
specified DNS server. If no filters are specified, a complete list of zones is returned.
Crash Handler was then used to install imjpuex.exe in the csidl_common_appdata\veritas
directory which in turn was used to side-load a DLL file of the same name and load a .dat file
to execute an unknown custom payload.

4/10

Shortly after this, the attackers attempted to list the records of multiple specific zones by
specifying the domain on the command line:
Dnscmd . /ZonePrint [REDACTED_DOMAIN]
On a fourth computer (Computer #4), the attackers used PsExec to execute Crash Handler
(this time named test.exe). They then installed and executed two KB files in the %TEMP%
directory.

ded734f79058c36a6050d801e1fb52cd5ca203f3fd6af6ddea52244132bd1b51
Again, both of these files were modified versions of the Windows command prompt.
On May 17, the attackers deployed several more modified Windows command prompt
applications on Computer #4. They also deployed the side-loading technique on Computer
#5 to execute the legitimate svchost.exe application, possibly to facilitate some process
injection.
On May 19, the attackers returned to Computer #5 and used svchost to launch
NetworkService. The attackers then used a variant of Mimikatz named calc.exe, which was
previously used earlier in the attack (SHA256:
912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9). Mimikatz
was used to dump credentials from the compromised host.
On May 24, the attackers turned their attention to Computer #3, using PsExec to execute the
whoami command and determine the currently logged-in user. They then ran an unknown
batch file name t.bat via PsExec.
It is likely the following commands were executed from this script in order to create a new
user account:
net user [REDACTED]
CSIDL_SYSTEM\net1 user [REDACTED] Asd123.aaaa /add
net localgroup [REDACTED] [REDACTED]/add
CSIDL_SYSTEM\net1 localgroup [REDACTED] /add
CSIDL_SYSTEM\net1 user [REDACTED] Asd123.aaaa /add
The script uses net.exe to check if a specific user account already exists. It then attempts to
create a user account with the password Asd123.aaaa and add it to the local group on the
machine. Several minutes later, the task manager was launched followed by a command

prompt. The attackers then ran the following command to mount a snapshot of the active
directory server.
ntdsutil snapshot "mount c2b3e2c6-1ffb-4625-ba8e-3503c27a9fcb" quit quit
These snapshots contain sensitive information such as the active directory database (i.e.
user credentials) and log files. The string c2b3e2c6-1ffb-4625-ba8e-3503c27a9fcb is the
index number of the snapshot.
The attackers then moved to Computer #5, where they used ProcDump (file name: p.exe,
SHA256: 2f1520301536958bcf5c65516ca85a343133b443db9835a58049cd1694460424) to
dump credentials from LSASS:
p.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass2.dmp
On May 26, the attackers returned to Computer #1 and executed a file called go64.exe. This
file was a copy of Fscan. The attackers ran the following command to mass scan for any
machines within the compromised network (specifically a class C scan against machines in
the IP range 10.72.0.0 → 10.72.0.255) with RDP services:
go64.exe -h 10.72.0.101/24 -pa 3389
There is also evidence that the attackers leveraged Fscan in order to perform exploit
attempts against other machines on the network, including leveraging one of the ProxyLogon
vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855) against an Exchange Server. Suspicious SMB activity also
occurred around this time, suggesting the attackers may have also leveraged other exploits
(likely EternalBlue) against any open SMB services.
On June 6, the attackers ran PsExec on Computer #3 to launch the previously used old
version of Crash Handler (file name: winnet.exe) from the %USERPROFILE%\public\
directory.
They ran the Dnscmd utility again to enumerate all available zones, before executing
winnet.exe again and a copy of Crash Handler located at APPDATA%\t.exe to load additional
malicious payloads (likely used to install ProcExplorer):
Dnscmd . /EnumZones
"CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\t.exe"
Several hours later, ProcExplorer (64-bit) was launched:
"CSIDL_PROFILE\desktop\processexplorer\procexp64.exe"
The last known malicious activity occurred on July 8 on Computer #3. The system hive file
was dumped from the registry in order to dump user credentials.

Payloads
While this group of attackers was previously using ShadowPad, it has since moved on and
has been deploying a range of payloads.
One of the payloads used was a previously unseen, feature-rich information stealer
(Infostealer.Logdatter), which appeared to be custom built. Its capabilities included:
Keylogging
Taking screenshots
Connecting to and querying SQL databases
Code injection: Reading a file and injecting the contained code into a process
Downloading files
Stealing clipboard data
Other payloads used by the attackers included:
PlugX/Korplug Trojan
Trochilus RAT
QuasarRAT
Ladon penetration testing framework
Nirsoft Remote Desktop PassView: A publicly available tool that reveals the password
stored by the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection utility inside .rdp files
A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) scanning tool
Fscan: A publicly available intranet scanning tool
Nbtscan: A command-line tool that scans for open NETBIOS name servers
FileZilla: A legitimate FTP client
FastReverseProxy: A reverse proxy tool
WebPass: A publicly available password collection tool
TCPing: A publicly available tool that enables pings over TCP
Various process dumpers
Various keyloggers
A number of PowerSploit scripts

Links to earlier activity
ShadowPad is a modular RAT that was designed as a successor to the Korplug/PlugX Trojan
and was, for a period of time, sold on underground forums. However, despite its origins as a
publicly available tool, it has since been closely linked to espionage actors. The tool was only
sold publicly for a very short period of time and it is believed that it was only sold to a handful
of buyers.

7/10

There is limited evidence to suggest links to past attacks involving the Korplug/PlugX
malware and to attacks by a number of known groups, including Blackfly/Grayfly (APT41)
and Mustang Panda. For example, the attackers leveraged a legitimate file called
HPCustParticUI.exe, which was developed by HP for digital imaging applications. This
previously occurred in attacks involving Korplug/Plug X. Furthermore, the attackers used a
file called hpcustpartui.dll as a likely loader. The same loader was used in a long-running
campaign involving Korplug/Plug X targeting the Roman Catholic Church.
The current campaign uses a legitimate Bitdefender file to side-load shellcode. This same file
and technique were observed in previous attacks linked to APT41. We have also observed
the same keylogging tool deployed in previous attacks against critical infrastructure in South
East Asia.
The use of legitimate applications to facilitate DLL side-loading appears to be a growing
trend among espionage actors operating in the region. Although a well-known technique, it
must be yielding some success for attackers given its current popularity. Organizations are
encouraged to thoroughly audit software running on their networks and monitor for the
presence of outliers, such as old, outdated software or packages that are not officially used
by the organization.
