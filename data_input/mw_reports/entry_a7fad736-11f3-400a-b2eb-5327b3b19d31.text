Threat Activity Group

PARISITE
Since 2017
PARISITE targets various industrial verticals including aerospace, oil and gas, and multiple
utilities including water, electric, and gas. PARISITE’s broad geographic targeting includes
entities in the US, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. Although PARISITE appears
focused on industrial organizations with industrial control system (ICS) implementations and
related entities, its targeting activity also includes government and non-governmental
organizations.

1/3

Dragos identified PARISITE activity targeting ICS-related entities using known virtual private
network (VPN) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities affect Fortinet, PulseSecure, and Palo
Alto Networks VPN appliances. PARISITE’s current focus of targeting vulnerable VPN
appliances indicates an interest in initial access to enterprise networks, including industrial
networks.
PARISITE infrastructure and capabilities date from at least 2017, indicating operations since
at least that time. PARISITE uses known open source penetration testing tools for
reconnaissance and to establish encrypted communications. This aligns with other activity
groups increasingly using publicly available tools and resources as opposed to customized
malware once achieving initial access.
At this time, PARISITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive or destructive
capability, demonstrating only initial access and enabling further operations for
MAGNALLIUM.
Dragos threat intelligence leverages the Dragos Platform, our threat operations center, and
other sources to provide comprehensive insight into threats affecting industrial control
security and safety worldwide. Dragos does not corroborate nor conduct political attribution

to threat activity. Dragos instead focuses on threat behaviors and appropriate detection and
response. Read more about Dragos’ approach to categorizing threat activity and attribution.
Dragos does not publicly describe ICS activity group technical details except in
extraordinary circumstances in order to limit tradecraft proliferation. However, full details on
PARISITE and other group tools, techniques, procedures, and infrastructure is available to
network defenders via Dragos WorldView.
