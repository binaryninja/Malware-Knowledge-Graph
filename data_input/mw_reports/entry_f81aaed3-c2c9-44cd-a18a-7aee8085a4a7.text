FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report
Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted parties: Windows Users
Impact: Unable to boot the machine
Severity level: Medium
Even now, almost two years after the COVID-19 pandemic started, there is no sign that
cybercriminals will stop taking advantage of the situation as an attack vector. This time,
however, this attacker uses a COVID pandemic that has not yet happened as bait.
FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a new malware posing as a mysterious COVID22
installer. While containing many of the features of "joke" malware, it is also destructive,
causing infected machines to fail to boot. Because it has no features for encrypting data

demanding a ransom to undo the damage it inflicts, it is instead a new destructive malware
variant designed to render affected systems inoperable. This blog explains how this malware
works.

Covid-22 in Action
The malware file is named Covid22. For those unfamiliar with the naming scheme, COVID19 is a short form of Coronavirusdisease, and 19 represents the year the outbreak was first
identified. The file name Covid22 plays off the current Coronavirus disease but applies that
same image of fear and destruction to computers, potentially creating a cyber-pandemic in
2022. While we don't know how exactly the malware was distributed, the malware author has
tried to weaponize fear as bait to lure victims into opening the file.
While the malware itself is not sophisticated, it does take several actions designed to put fear
into the victim before inducing true panic. But before that, when first manually running the
file, it asks whether the potential victim wants to install Covid-22 on their machine, as if it
were an application.

Once the victim proceeds with the installation, the malware drops several malicious files
before forcefully rebooting the machine. Dropped files have file names that are simple and
self-described for their actions. They are listed below in sequence of execution.

lol.vbs creates an endless loop of a MessageBox with "Your PC has been infected by
Covid-22 Corona Virus! Enjoy the death of your pc!"

These are the classic actions of joke programs usually intended to annoy or make fun of
users. But the next activity is not laughable at all. The malware drops and executes the
malicious WipeMBR.exe wiper malware that destroys the Master Boot Record (MBR)
by overwriting its first 512 bytes with zeros. The malware then forces a machine reboot after
displaying the following pop-up message:
Figure 8. Final pop-up message before forcefully rebooting the compromised machine
Because MBR has information about the partitions of the hard drive and acts as a loader for
the operating system (OS), the compromised machine will not be able to load the OS upon
reboot. The good news for the users is that the malware does not destroy nor steal any files
on the compromised device, meaning the victim can still recover user files from the hard
drive. The malware also does not demand ransom.
While the result is almost identical to another MBR wiper that Sonicwall posted a blog about
in April 2020, our analysis did not show any resemblance in their wiper codes. This newer
variant simply overwrites the MBR with zeroes.

How to Repair a Damaged MBR
Fixing an MBR is relatively easy in modern Windows. After the affected machine reboots
(sometimes it requires a few reboots), the system enters automatic repair mode. First,
choose Advanced Options, Troubleshoot. Another Advanced Option should then let you use
the Command Prompt. From the Command Prompt, type and run "bootrec.exe /fixmbr".
An alternative and more straightforward option would be to choose Startup Repair on the
screen to run the Command Prompt. The downside of selecting Startup Repair is that it will
take longer to complete the job.
If the automatic repair mode does not kick in for some reason, you'll need to boot the system
off a recovery disk or drive. Note that you'll need to change your BIOS settings to ensure the
system boots from the recovery media first, or else the system will try to boot using the
overwritten MBR leading to a boot error. Once the system boots from recovery media, you
should be able to choose to run the command prompt, whereby the user can run the
command "bootrec.exe /fixmbr".

It is also vital to remind system administrators of the importance of backing up your data on
external storage in case any of your files are ever damaged, encrypted, or destroyed. You
will also want to create recovery media beforehand, or else you will need to use a working
machine, which can be difficult for home users after the damage is done.

Conclusion on COVID-22 Brings Disaster to MBR
What looks to be a mere joke program is designed to bring destruction to impacted systems.
This time, luck was on the victim's side as the malware did not touch any user data, but the
user may not be so lucky next time. Imagine if the files on the compromised machine had
been encrypted or destroyed and could not be recovered. Always be mindful of executing
unknown files received from the internet.

Fortinet Protections
Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware by the FortiGuard Labs AntiVirus
