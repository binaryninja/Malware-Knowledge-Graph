Last week, Cisco Talos published a blog post with new research on LodaRAT. Apart from
updates to the Windows version of this malware, the researchers also found Android
malware (‘Loda4Android’) written by the same group. They link both versions of the
malware to an ongoing campaign targeting people or entities in Bangladesh.
This blog post reveals some further infrastructure used in this campaign.

LodaRAT
LodaRAT, or Loda, is information gathering malware. It has the ability to take screenshots of
infected machines, record keystrokes and sound and allows its operators to send
commands to the machine. It was first analysed by Proofpoint in May 2017.
In most of its campaigns, LodaRAT has been spreading through malicious documents, that
either contained malicious macros or exploited vulnerabilities in Office. Some earlier
campaigns exploited CVE-2017-0199, while more recent ones exploited CVE-2017-11882.
Though patched several years ago, the latter vulnerability remains popular among malware
authors.
Among the indicators of compromise shared by Talos is the domain lap-top[.]xyz, from
which a malicious APK file was served. This domain was registered in October and points
to 134.122.120[.]22, an IP address belonging to the popular cloud infrastructure provider
Digital Ocean.
While looking in Silent Push’s database for other domains that have pointed to this IP
address, I noticed two that turned out to be actively serving LodaRAT: corona-bd[.]com and
imei[.]today.

Using the COVID-19 vaccine as a lure

1/6

At first glance, corona-bd[.]com looks like an official Bangladeshi government website with
information on the coronavirus. That’s not surprising, because in an iframe it contains that
very website, hosted at corona.gov.bd.
But right above the iframe, there is a grey bar with the Bengali text “ থমধােপ অ ািধকার
িভি েত কেরানা ভাইরােসর িটকা পাওয়ার আেবদন করেত এখােন ি ক ক ন।” which Google helped me
translate to “Click here to apply for the corona virus vaccine on a first-come, first-served
basis.”

The real Bangladeshi government website (left) and the fake one with an extra link on top
(right)
This link goes to a form that asks for many personal details, some of which (such as
“Freedom Fighter Status”) may appear unusual for non-Bangladeshis. Upon filling in the
form, you are presented with a page telling you your application has been accepted. It is
unclear whether the information filled in the form is used in some way, but JavaScript
carefully checks you have filled everything in, after which it is submitted to the server in a
POST request.
Once you have submitted the form, you are urged to download the a copy of the
application. Apart from a receipt number, which is different every time the page loads, you
are given a password to open the application. The application turns out to be a zip file
protected with this password and inside is a variant of LodaRAT (SHA256:
e78546bb33df88c6be3afce32f5d13084295a6e0599b26c3b380d54318170d86).
I don’t know how people end up on this website: whether it relies on natural traffic, or
whether the campaign urges specific targets to visit it, but the context of the campaign and
the apparent lack of public links to it make the latter more likely.

2/6

Interestingly, the domain corona-bd[.]com had been active many years ago, when it hosted
the website of a fashion company. Last spring, it was registered again to serve information
related to the coronavirus pandemic.
From the copy on the Wayback Machine, I can’t determine any malicious purpose of this
website, but it shared an IP address with a number of domains that Talos also linked to this
campaign, so it is likely that the same actor was hosting it already. This would suggest this
campaign, or at least preparations for it, started well before October.

Fake IMEI checker
The second domain, imei[.]today, hosts what appears to be a checker for IMEIs: numbers
that uniquely identify mobile phones.
The page lay-out is largely copied from the legitimate site imei.info, but made to look to
belong to the BTRC, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. This site
thus too targets Bangladesh, even if it is written in English, a language however still widely
understood in the country.

Legitimate (left) and malicitious (right) IMEI checker
Upon entering a valid IMEI number (client-side JavaScript performs the ‘Luhn check’), the
user is served a zip file. Inside this zip file, which this time is not protected with a password,
is another variant of LodaRAT (SHA256:
cf29981bfec0f0cf2abd54ae469c8795a3cf1e19c715ded329fdb2707f982407).

Other domains

3/6

While I found these domains because both have used the IP address 134.122.120[.]22,
they have in fact shared several more IP addresses. And there are several more domains
that have used some of these addresses in recent months.
One is mybnp[.]club. This site looks near identical to bnpbd.org, the website of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (a Bangladeshi political party), from which it includes most
content. The only difference is a line on top that says (in Bengali) “Click here to register to
become a member of the BNP” that links to a signup page. This signup page contains an
iframe that loads content from http://educationboardresults[.]net/php/application/.
However, there is no content there: educationboardresults[.]net is a parked domain.
Moreover, mybnp[.]club does not render well in most modern browsers, due to mixed
content errors. It may be that this site was intended to be used in the campaign but then
abandoned.
Other domains that have used IP addresses in the same set include av24[.]co and
bracbank[.]info, both of which were mentioned by Talos, but also bkash[.]club,
bkashagent[.]com, aktel[.] org and zepode[.]online. All of these are relevant to
Bangladeshis: bKash is a mobile financial service in Bangladesh, AKTEL is the former
name of a mobile phone provider in Bangladesh, and Zepode is an ecommerce platform
popular in the region.

Information on aktel[.]org on Silent Push’s dashboard.
Apart from using some of the same IP addresses, all of these domains use two
nameservers ns1.domain and ns2.domain with domain the domain itself and both name
servers pointing to the same IP address as the domain's A recor , a somewhat peculiar setup.

4/6

I had not been able to find any content hosted on these latter four domains, but that does
not mean URLs with malware don’t exist. It is also possible that these have been registered
for future use in this campaign.

A hacker-for hire campaign?
Writing about the discovery of LodaRAT activity in Bangladesh, Cyberscoop suggests it
might belong to a hacker-for-hire group.
Last year, several hacker-for-hire operations (sometimes referred to as ‘cyber mercenaries’)
have been uncovered. Such groups make cyber-espionage capabilities available to
companies, political organisations as well as nation states without their own offensive cyber
capabilities.
LodaRAT’s activity has all the hallmarks of such an operation. First, the geographic spread
of the activities: Talos believes the group is based in Morocco (which is why it is referred to
as ‘Kasablanka’) and previous activity by this group was linked to Latin America, while this
campaign targets Bangladesh. The Android malware used by this group has been linked to
campaigns in the Middle East.
Secondly, the malware focuses on gathering information rather than on direct financial gain,
which would be common for malware used by a more traditional cybercrime group.
And thirdly, this particular campaign appears fairly targeted. While the real size can’t be
determined without global telemetry, a more widespread campaign would have likely left
public traces through search engines and public thread feeds.
Of course, none of this is conclusive proof of the kind of operation this is. Nor does it mean
that the authors of the malware are the same as the ones conducting this campaign.

Conclusion
Malware and phishing campaigns make a serious effort to stay under the radar. However,
limited resources forces threat actors to reuse infrastructure.
In this case, with the help of Silent Push’s API, I was able to use this weakness to uncover
more infrastructure used by the ‘Kasablanka’ actor in its targeting of Bangladesh, based on
a few publicly posted indicators.

116.203.37[.]39
134.122.120[.]22
Of these, 94.130.110[.]78 had a PTR record set to be vps.corona-bd[.]com, while
134.122.120[.]22 used vps.lap-top[.]xyz as a PTR record. This confirms that at least these
two IP addresses are or were attacker owned rather than shared hosting space.
Some other IP addresses that the domains have pointed to were shared with too many
unrelated domains to considered them reliable indicators for this domain, or for malicious
activity in general; hence they have not been listed.
