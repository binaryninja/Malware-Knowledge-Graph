The IO Offensive: Information Operations Surrounding
the Russian Invasion of Ukraine
mandiant.com/resources/information-operations-surrounding-ukraine

The recent phase of Russian aggression toward Ukraine, manifested by Russia’s full-scale
invasion, has flooded the information environment with disinformation promoted by a full
spectrum of actors. Concerted information operations have proliferated, ranging from cyberenabled information operations, including those that coincided with disruptive and
destructive cyber threat activity, to campaigns leveraging coordinated and inauthentic
networks of accounts to promote fabricated content and desired narratives across various
social media platforms, websites, and forums.
While the full extent of this activity has yet to be seen, more than two months after the start
of the invasion, Mandiant has identified activity that we attributed to information operations
campaigns conducted by actors we judge to be operating in support of the political interests
of nation-states such as Russia, Belarus, China, and Iran, including ongoing campaigns that
we have tracked for years. This report examines a slice of this activity, highlighting significant
information operations Mandiant has observed in our work responding to the invasion and
presenting our early analysis of those events.

Information Operations Aligned with Russian Interests Concurrent
with Disruptive and Destructive Cyber Threat Activity
Mandiant identified information operations aligned with Russian political interests that
occurred concurrently with disruptive and destructive, likely Russian sponsored cyber threat
activity in the weeks immediately preceding and following the start of the invasion, including
incidents involving the deployment of wiper malware disguised as ransomware (Table 1).
Cyber-enabled information operations by nature require access to diverse skillsets to support
different operational components, which varies based on the complexity of the operation.
While we cannot link these operations to the concurrent disruptive and destructive activity,
this limited pattern of overlap may suggest that some of the actors behind information
operations observed in this conflict are linked to groups with extensive capabilities.

2022

Multiple Ukrainian government websites,
including that of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
were defaced with a message in Russian,
Ukrainian, and Polish claiming that data had
been deleted from government servers and
would be released.

The defacements likely
coincided with the January
deployment of destructive
tools PAYWIPE, an MBR wiper
disguised as ransomware, and
the SHADYLOOK file
corrupter against Ukrainian
government and other targets.

Feb.

2022

Dozens of Ukrainian government websites were
defaced with the same image displayed in the
Jan. 14 incident.

This incident coincided with
destructive attacks against
Ukrainian government targets
using the NEARMISS master
boot record (MBR) wiper and
PARTYTICKET wiper
disguised as ransomware.

March
16,
2022

An information operation targeting Ukraine
promoted a fabricated message alleging
Ukraine's surrender to Russia via the suspected
compromise and defacement of the Ukraine 24
website and news ticker in a Ukraine 24 TV
broadcast with a written message, as well as via
an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated
"deepfake" video impersonating Ukrainian
President Zelenskyy delivering that same text.

On the same day, Mandiant
identified the JUNKMAIL wiper
targeting a Ukrainian
organization. The malware
was configured via a
scheduled task to execute
approximately three hours
before Zelenskyy was
scheduled to deliver a speech
to the U.S. Congress.

destructive cyber threat activity

Russian and Belarusian Information Operations Include CyberEnabled Operations, Use of Established Assets
Russian and Belarusian information operations actors and campaigns, including those that
have historically been linked to cyber threat activity such as hack-and-leak operations, have
engaged in activity surrounding the invasion that is consistent with their previously
established motives. Their use of developed campaign infrastructure, including in some
instances the refocusing of established assets, demonstrates how years-long efforts of
Russian, pro-Russian, and Belarusian information operations targeting Ukraine and the
broader region have been leveraged to address emerging security interests. In addition to
known campaigns, we have also identified information operations activity promoting proRussian content on the invasion that we have not attributed to a previously observed
campaign or actor.

operations surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. "Russia-aligned" refers to Russian, Belarusian,
and pro-Russia activity; this graphic does not reflect activity pre-dating this conflict

APT28: Telegram channels that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has attributed as
information operations assets of the 85th Main Special Service Center of the Russian General
Staff’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the same organization to which the U.S. and UK
governments attributed APT28 activity, have continued to post content pertaining to the
current conflict. These channels were active prior to the invasion, and while we were unable
to independently confirm the SBU’s attribution, we note that the channels’ activity includes
promoting content that appears intended to weaken Ukrainians’ confidence in their
government and its response to the invasion. The content also appears intended to
undermine support for Ukraine from its Western partners, interspersed with more seemingly
benign posts relaying apolitical content or news reporting.
APT28 has an extensive history of involvement in information operations, ranging from
hack-and-leak operations to disruptive activity. Prominent operations involving APT28
have included compromises of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) and
U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) in 2016, documents from
which were subsequently leaked by the false hacktivist persona Guccifer 2.0, and the
2014 compromise, defacement, data leak, and data destruction of the Ukrainian Central
Election Commission’s network and website.

3/13

Ghostwriter: A suspected Ghostwriter operation in April leveraged a suspected
compromised website and multiple suspected compromised or otherwise actor-controlled
social media accounts to publish fabricated content to promote a narrative that appeared
intended to foment distrust between Ukrainians and the Polish government. Inauthentic
personas we attributed to the Ghostwriter campaign have also continued to publish and
promote opinion articles criticizing NATO and its presence in the Baltic States, with
increased references to Ukraine in that context. We have assessed with moderate confidence
that Belarus is likely at least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign.
In the weeks leading up to the invasion and subsequent weeks thereafter, we observed
multiple campaigns conducted by Belarusian espionage group UNC1151 targeting
European countries, including a recent spear-phishing campaign targeting Lithuania.
Observed targeting associated with UNC1151 threat activity is notable, given the group’s
technical support to information operations attributed to Ghostwriter.
Niezależny Dziennik Polityczny (NDP): Immediately following Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, we observed assets associated with NDP, an information operations campaign
centered around an online journal of the same name, shift toward an aggressive defense of
Russian strategic interests. During this period, we observed the campaign’s concerted
promotion of narratives seeded by both overt and covert sources within Russia’s propaganda
and disinformation ecosystem. We do not attribute the NDP campaign to a specific actor.
However, we have observed overlaps between NDP and the Ghostwriter campaign that may
suggest some degree of coordination or advanced shared knowledge of operational planning
between the two campaigns.
Secondary Infektion: Both prior to and during the invasion, the ongoing suspected
Russian influence campaign referred to as “Secondary Infektion” has continued its
operations, targeting audiences with fabricated narratives that are often supported by
falsified source materials, such as forged documents, correspondence, pamphlets, and
screenshots, as well as counterfeit petitions and interviews. All specific Secondary Infektion
activity referenced in this blog are operations that we are sharing our attribution of publicly
for the first time.
Internet Research Agency (IRA): Reporting from the Russian newspaper Fontanka.ru
suggested the existence of covert influence operations related to the Telegram channel “Cyber
Front Z.” The channel is overtly dedicated to organizing the coordinated promotion of proRussia content pertaining to the invasion to audiences in Russia, Ukraine, and the West on
social media (Figure 2). The Fontanka.ru report claimed that Cyber Front Z may be run by
individuals linked to entities sanctioned by the U.S. as related to the IRA, and that the paid
positions promoted by this Telegram channel are part of a “troll factory” that uses
inauthentic personas to promote pro-Russia content on multiple platforms. We are unable to
independently confirm these claims, but note that such activity is aligned with what we have
previously observed from known IRA assets.

Russian Intelligence-Linked Covert Media Outlets: We observed outlets that selfpresent as independent entities, but have been publicly reported to be linked to Russian
intelligence entities, engaged in the publication and amplification of pro-Russia narratives
related to the invasion. These include outlets with reported links to the Foreign Intelligence

5/13

Service of the Russian Federation (SVR), Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation
(FSB), and Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian
Federation (GRU).
Russia-Aligned “Hacktivist” Groups: Established hacktivist personas JokerDNR and
Beregini have remained active in their targeting of Ukraine in the leadup to and since
Russia’s invasion, including through their publication of allegedly leaked documents
featuring possible personally identifiable information (PII) of Ukrainian military members.
Additionally, newly established “hacktivist” groups, whose degrees of affiliation to the
Russian state are yet unknown, like Killnet, Xaknet, and RahDit, have engaged in hacktiviststyle threat activity in support of Russia, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks, hack-and-leak operations, and defacements.

Observed Pro-Russia Narratives Seek to Demoralize Ukrainians, Sow
Division Between Ukraine and Western Allies, Bolster Public
Perception of Russia
Disinformation narratives promoted through concerted information operations have made
an array of claims attempting to shape perceptions of the invasion and the larger geopolitical
context surrounding it. Many of the narratives we have observed promoted appear intended
to serve at least one of these three functions: demoralizing Ukrainians and fomenting
internal unrest; dividing Ukraine from its allies; and bolstering perceptions of Russia (Figure
3). Much of this activity has targeted audiences in Ukraine and Europe. However, we have
also identified information operations assets promoting messaging that we judge to be aimed
at Russian domestic audiences, underscoring Russia’s need to sell the war to its own people.

Figure 3: Observed Russia-aligned narrative themes related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

Demoralize the Ukrainian Population
We have identified multiple narratives that appeared intended to demoralize Ukrainians and
incite internal unrest within Ukraine, including false claims of the surrender of the Ukrainian
government or military.

6/13

An information operation in March disseminated an artificial intelligence (AI)generated “deepfake” video of Zelenskyy stating that Ukraine had surrendered to
Russia, and defaced the Ukraine 24 website and news ticker in a Ukraine 24 TV
broadcast with an identical message or screenshot from the deepfake video (Figure 4).
Since the start of the war, other Ukrainian websites have also been defaced with
messages alleging Ukraine’s surrender.
A Secondary Infektion operation in March falsely claimed that Zelenskyy had
committed suicide in the military bunker in Kyiv where he had been leading the fight
against the invasion, alleging that he had been contemplating suicide due to Ukraine’s
military failures.
Another Secondary Infektion operation from April alleged that the Azov “gang” sought
vengeance against Zelenskyy for abandoning their fighters to die in Mariupol, and
claimed that Azov commanders had attempted to escape the city by pretending to be
civilians. (The narrative here specifically refers to Ukraine's Azov Regiment, a special
operations detachment within the Ukrainian National Guard, which is itself part of a
broader ultranationalist movement—segments of which have been known to espouse
white nationalist rhetoric; Azov has frequently appeared in pro-Russia narratives
seeking to cast the Ukrainian government, and Ukrainians more broadly, as Nazis.)
Telegram channels attributed by Ukraine to the GRU highlighted alleged corruption
and incompetence on the part of the Ukrainian government, such as claims that
Ukraine was unprepared for the conflict, and that Ukrainian oligarchs had “paid
Zelenskyy for the right to leave the country.”

7/13

that Ukraine would surrender to Russia

Divide Ukraine from Its Allies
A recent Ghostwriter operation, which we are making our attribution of public for the
first time, leveraged compromised assets to publish fabricated content promoting the
narrative that a Polish criminal ring was harvesting organs from Ukrainian refugees to
illegally traffic in the European Union, and that Poland’s Internal Security Agency was
investigating the criminal enterprise, which was said to involve “high-ranking Polish
officials.”

8/13

Opinion articles published by suspected inauthentic personas associated with NDP
promoted narratives seemingly intended to damage Polish-Ukrainian relations by
creating fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding Poland’s acceptance of
Ukrainian refugees. These narratives included falsehoods that sought to portray the
refugees as overly burdening Poland’s economy and healthcare system and to stoke
fears among Polish citizens that “neo-Nazis”, or other undesirable immigrants, would
begin exploiting mass border crossings to carry out attacks on Polish soil.
The Jan. 14 and Feb. 23 defacements of Ukrainian government websites referenced war
crimes committed by the "Ukrainian Insurgent Army" (UPA) against ethnic Poles
during World War II, a theme previously observed in Russian and Belarusian
information operations. For example, a November 2021 Ghostwriter operation featured
a fabricated account from a retired Polish general, stating that the alleged presence of
Ukrainian volunteers with far-right political leanings in Poland was “an insult” to the
victims of the same war crimes.
Recent Ukrainian- and Russian-language Secondary Infektion operations claimed that
the Ukrainian and Polish governments sought to enable Polish troops to deploy in
western Ukraine, a move they portrayed as anathema to the Ukrainian people. One
operation in early April claimed that Poland attempted to use an alleged “provocation,”
staged by Ukraine, showing Russian troops committing atrocities in Bucha to justify
stationing troops in the country, while an operation in early February involved the
dissemination of a map showing specific locations where Polish troops would be
located, with the suggestion that those troops would occupy large swaths of Ukraine for
years (Figure 5).
Observed narratives from Telegram channels Ukraine attributed to the GRU included
suggestions that the West would soon forget about and abandon Ukraine, due in part to
the diversion of its attention to impending conflicts elsewhere, such as a potential war
launched by the U.S. against Iran.

locations where Polish troops would be stationed in western Ukraine

Bolster Perceptions of Russia
Multiple identified narratives have appeared intended to bolster perceptions of Russia
through denial and deflection, including by refuting Russian war crimes in Ukraine and
making counter-allegations against Ukrainian forces.
Cyber Front Z, in its coordinated promotion of pro-Russia commentary, called on social
media users to claim that Ukrainian “Nazis” forced civilians into a theater in Mariupol,
which they then detonated.
We identified a coordinated and inauthentic network of social media accounts that
promoted Russian-language messaging, including assertions that Ukrainian forces had
used chemical weapons.
These accounts also denied the effects of the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, such as sanctions on Russia, and claimed that such measures had negative
consequences for the West.

Pro-PRC Information Operations Campaign DRAGONBRIDGE
Messaging Includes Echoes of Russian State-Promoted Narratives
DRAGONBRIDGE, a pro-PRC campaign which comprises a network of thousands of
inauthentic accounts across numerous social media platforms, websites, and forums that we
first reported to customers in 2019, has shifted its messaging in response to the Ukraine

10/13

crisis and subsequent invasion. DRAGONBRIDGE content in English and Chinese has
included echoing narratives promoted by Russian state media and influence campaigns, such
as alleging the existence of Pentagon-linked laboratories conducting biological weapons
research in Ukraine. Notably, such echoing of narratives is not unusual, and charging the
U.S. with malfeasance and interference in other countries is likewise in line with PRC
political interests; we have previously observed both pro-PRC and pro-Russia information
operations promoting content on the alleged involvement of U.S. biolabs in hazardous
research. The campaign’s leveraging of Russia-aligned narratives on Ukraine may constitute
a form of political opportunism in its continued attempts to target the U.S. and the West’s
global standing.
On March 6, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed that
Russia’s military operation in Ukraine had uncovered evidence of Pentagon-linked
laboratories in Ukraine conducting bioweapons research. DRAGONBRIDGE accounts
subsequently amplified this claim, including allegations that U.S.-funded biolabs
existed not only in Ukraine, but also around the world.
DRAGONBRIDGE accounts also insinuated that the alleged biolabs in Ukraine were
responsible for “mysterious outbreaks,” the nature of which went unexplained, and that
biolabs elsewhere in the world were likewise harming local populations (Figure 6).

Figure 6: Screenshot from DRAGONBRIDGE video insinuating a connection between the presence of a
U.S. biolab in Ukraine and the occurrence of multiple “mysterious outbreaks”

DRAGONBRIDGE messaging on the invasion also appeared to take aim at U.S. foreign policy
and its relations with other countries through claims that the U.S. is self-serving in its actions
and that it is an unreliable partner in its alliances. Some accounts alleged that the U.S. sought

11/13

to fan the flames of the conflict as it stood to benefit the most, citing its arms sales to
Ukraine, while others cast doubt on the U.S. and Europe’s seeming policy alignment on
sanction measures against Russia, suggesting that the U.S. had bullied Europe into enacting
those sanctions, despite deepening energy woes on the continent.

Pro-Iran Information Operations Denigrate Western Response to
Conflict, Take Aim at Russia-Israel Relationship
Similarly, Mandiant has observed Iranian and pro-Iran information operations leveraging
narratives pertaining to the invasion to take aim at the West, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
Involved campaigns have included the Liberty Front Press (LFP) campaign, as well as activity
from a pro-Iran campaign we have not previously named that we are dubbing “Roaming
Mayfly”, due to its potential links to the Iran-aligned Endless Mayfly influence campaign that
Citizen Lab reported on in 2019.
Messaging directed at Arabic-language audiences asserted that the U.S. fled from
Afghanistan in 2021, and had now abandoned Ukraine, which deserved its fate due to
its alliance with the “American axis of evil.” Similarly, English-language content
averred that NATO had sacrificed Ukraine to avoid engaging in a war with Russia.
Pro-Iran information operations assets also declared that Ukraine should not have
surrendered its nuclear weapons, implying that such a concession had left it vulnerable
to the subsequent invasion.
Pro-Iran information operations have also leveraged the conflict to accuse the West of
hypocrisy in its dealings with Saudi Arabia compared to Russia, by juxtaposing the war
in Ukraine against the war in Yemen. Tangentially, assets leveled accusations of racism
on the part of the West against Arabs and Muslims, noting alleged differences in its
response to the conflict in Ukraine in comparison to conflicts in the Middle East.
We also observed Roaming Mayfly target Russian audiences on the eve of the war in what
appeared to be an attempt to use the crisis in order to drive tensions between Russia and
Israel. Namely, the campaign leveraged a (now-suspended) impersonator of the Russian
journalist and foreign policy thinker, Fyodor Lukyanov, to publish tweets suggesting that
Israeli intelligence was supporting Ukraine against Russia in the current crisis, and that
Israel had supported the “Ukrainian color [revolutions]” of 2000, 2004, and 2014 (Figure 7).

Outlook
Information operations observed in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have
exhibited both tactical aims responding to, or seeking to shape, events on the ground and
strategic objectives attempting to influence the shifting geopolitical landscape. While these
operations have presented an outsized threat to Ukraine, they have also threatened the U.S.
and other Western countries. As a result, we anticipate that such operations, including those
involving cyber threat activity and potentially other disruptive and destructive attacks, will
continue as the conflict progresses.
One notable feature of operations attributed to known actors thus far is their apparent
consistency with the respective campaign’s established motives. Russia-aligned operations,
including those attributed to Russian, Belarusian, and pro-Russia actors, have thus far
employed the widest array of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to support tactical
and strategic objectives, directly linked to the conflict itself. This is especially beneficial when
the facts on the ground shape Russia’s need to influence events in Ukraine, marshal domestic
Russian support, and manage global perceptions of Russia’s actions. Meanwhile, pro-PRC
and pro-Iran campaigns have leveraged the Russian invasion opportunistically to further
progress long-held strategic objectives. We likewise expect this dynamic to continue, and are
actively monitoring for expansions in their scope of information operations activity
surrounding the conflict.
