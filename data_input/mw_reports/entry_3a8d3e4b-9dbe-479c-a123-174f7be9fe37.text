Summary
Several days ago, EST Security published a post concerning a fake antivirus malware
targeting the Android mobile platform. In the Korean media, it was mentioned that there
could be a link between this Android malware and Group 123. Talos decided to investigate
this malware. And due to our reporting and history of following of Group 123, we discovered
some interesting elements.
Talos identified two variants of the Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT). Both samples
have the same capabilities — namely to steal information on the compromised device (such
as contacts, SMS and phone history) and record the victim's phone calls. One variant uses a
known Android exploit (CVE-2015-3636) in order to get root access on the compromised
Android device. The data of both variants was sent using an HTTP POST to a unique
command and control (C2) server. The ability to record calls was implemented based on an
open-source project available on GitHub. We named this malware "KevDroid."
1/9

Another RAT (this time targeting Windows) was identified hosted on the command and
control server in use by KevDroid. This malware specifically uses the PubNub platform as its
C2 server. PubNub is a global data stream network (DSN). The attackers use the PubNub
API in order to publish orders to the compromised systems. This behaviour explains why we
named it "PubNubRAT."
At this time, we cannot identify a link between these samples and the Group 123 sample. We
only identified a bundle of tactics, techniques and procedural elements that were too weak to
identify a real link.

Android Malware: KevDroid

Variant 1
The first variant of KevDroid is the smaller sample, and is similar to the sample described by
EST Security. We chose to call it KevDroid due to the Android author tag reading as "Kevin,"
and with some other artifacts referencing the name "Kevin." It is based on the aykuttasil
project. The purpose of this project it to provide a library to record phone calls made on
Android devices. The attacker kept the original name in the malware:

2/9

The purpose of the application is to steal information stored on the device. Here is the list of
stolen information:
Installed applications
Phone number
Phone Unique ID
Location (the application tries to switch on the GPS), this information is collected every
10 seconds, which is aggressive for this kind of spying tool
Stored contacts information (name, phone numbers, emails, photos, etc.)
Stored SMS
Call logs
Stored emails
Photos
Recording calls
If an adversary were successful in obtaining some of the information KevDroid is capable of
collecting, it could result in a multitude of issues for the victim. The social aspect of a mobile
device results in a large amount of data residing on the device. This can be sensitive data,
such as photographs, passwords, banking information or social engineering. This could
result in the leakage of data, which could lead to a number of things, such as the kidnapping
of a loved one, blackmail by using images or information deemed secret, credential
harvesting, multi-factor token access (SMS MFA), banking/financial implications and access
to privileged information, perhaps via emails/texts. Many users access their corporate email
via mobile devices. This could result in cyber espionage being a potential outcome for
KevDroid.
The APK sample was identified at the following URL during March 2018:
hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/1.apk
The stealer exfiltrates data on the same server at the following URL:

3/9

The APK package was named "Update," and the installation icon is the Droid logo:

Variant 2
The second variant of KevDroid is larger than the previous sample we discovered, and was
located in the same URL in February 2018. This sample was named "PU," and the icon logo
was empty. The architecture of the malware is a little bit different than the previous version.
For example, this variant uses SQLite databases to store data.
The variant contains the same features than the previous version with some additional:
Camera recording
Audio recording
Web history stealing
File stealing
Root access on the device
The last feature is performed by an ELF file embedded in the APK. The file is named "POC"
and supports 32-bit versions of operating systems. It attempts to exploit the device using
CVE-2015-3636 with the code available on GitHub. The purpose is to obtain the root
permission on the compromised device. By obtaining root permissions on the device, the
malware has effectively obtained higher privileges, allowing it to perform more in-depth

actions (such as getting files from other applications). This is a common technique that
malware often uses to ensure it can run without user interaction or a prompt, and is used to
remain stealthy.
The C2 server is the same as previously mentioned:

Windows Malware: PubNubRAT

Malware Samples
We discovered a Windows binary on the server at the following URL:
hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/hr.doc
The purpose of this binary is to download additional files:
hxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/Ant_4.5.exe
hxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/Ant_3.5.exe
hxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/desktops.ini
We found an additional sample that downloads the same files on our original server:
hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/1211me/Ant_4.5.exe
hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/1211me/Ant_3.5.exe
hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/1211me/desktops.ini
The downloaded executables are RATs developed in .NET, and the desktops.ini file is the
configuration file (XOR'd with key 0x17). The malware uses a public service as C2 servers. It
also uses PubNub. Here is the decoded configuration containing the token of the attacker
and the URL:
ps.pndsn.com
Process
sub-c-2199cb5c-f20a-11e7-acf8-26f7716e5467
pub-c-cdb76f31-abb8-4c47-aed3-d8c1de7bf5e6

5/9

The attackers use the PubNub API in order to send orders to the infected systems. Here is
the commands list:

The malware is able to steal files, download files, execute commands, kill processes and
create screenshots (stored in the tmp0120.ini file).
Using legitimate services is always challenging for defenders. It's hard to identify malicious
communications hidden in legitimate network flows (especially if the requests use encryption
via HTTPS).

6/9

We can notice some fun content within the PubNubRAT sample:

Haizi means child in Chinese. This string obviously did not mean that the malware was
developed by Chinese author. However, it's a message sent to the analyst. As we mentioned
during our Olympic Destroyer post, false flags can be used by attackers to manipulate
analysts. This kind of single string can be this kind of flag.

Infection Vector: Bitcoin & China
The first executable was downloaded and executed from a RTF document named bitcointrans.doc:

The RTF document contains an embedded Microsoft Equation object. This object exploits
the vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 in order to download and execute the hr.doc file mentioned
previously.

7/9

The document is written in Korean. It describes the quantity of Bitcoin owned by China and
explains how China handles Bitcoin. It mentions the current status of Bitcoin transactions
and some insights on the value of Bitcoin.

Conclusion
Originally, Talos took the time to investigate this malware due to its potential link to Group
123. As discovered, we do not have a strong link between the two malware samples and
Group 123. The TTP overlaps are tenuous — using public cloud infrastructure as a C2
server is something other malware has used before as a technique, not just Group 123.
Additionally, the C2 server is hosted in Korea, and this malware has been known to target
Korean users. However, this information cannot lead us to a strong link. In light of this, we
did discover some new Android-based malware and some Windows-based malware
attempting to steal information and control infected systems. These samples are not
documented and not massively used, but we hope than this post will highlight campaigns
performed by this actor.
