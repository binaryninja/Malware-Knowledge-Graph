RedAlpha Conducts Multi-Year
Credential Theft Campaign Targeting
Global Humanitarian, Think Tank,
and Government Organizations

THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

This report details multiple campaigns conducted by the likely Chinese statesponsored threat activity group RedAlpha. The activity was identified through a
combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis.
Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, SecurityTrails, PolySwarm,
DomainTools Iris, urlscan, and common open-source tools and techniques. It will
be of most interest to individuals and organizations with strategic and operational
intelligence requirements relating to Chinese cyber threat activity, as well as global
humanitarian, think tank, and government organizations. Prior to the publication
of this report, Recorded Future notified all affected organizations of the identified
activity to support incident response and remediation investigations.

Executive Summary
In parallel with regular reporting from humanitarian and media
organizations regarding human rights abuses orchestrated by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Recorded Future regularly
observes Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage and
surveillance campaigns likely intended to facilitate intelligence
collection used in support of such abuses. Among these, we
continue to track activity we attribute to the likely Chinese statesponsored threat activity group RedAlpha (Deepcliff, Red Dev 3),
as we previously reported in June 2018. Since this time, we have
continued to observe the group engaging in mass credential
theft activity primarily targeting humanitarian, think tank, and
government organizations globally.

Key Judgments
• RedAlpha is likely attributable to contractors conducting
cyber-espionage activity on behalf of the Chinese state.
This assessment is based on the group’s consistent
targeting in line with the strategic interests of the CCP,
historical links to personas and a private company
situated in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and the
wider regularly documented use of private contractors by
Chinese intelligence agencies.
• In this activity, RedAlpha very likely sought to
gain access to email accounts and other online
communications of targeted individuals and
organizations.
• RedAlpha’s humanitarian and human rights-linked
targeting and spoofing of organizations such as Amnesty
International and FIDH is particularly concerning given
the CCP’s reported human rights abuses in relation
to Uyghurs, Tibetans, and other ethnic and religious
minority groups in China.

Over the past 3 years, we have observed RedAlpha registering
and weaponizing hundreds of domains spoofing organizations
such as the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH),
Amnesty International, the Mercator Institute for China Studies
(MERICS), Radio Free Asia (RFA), the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT), and other global government, think tank, and humanitarian
organizations that fall within the strategic interests of the Chinese
government. Historically, the group has also engaged in direct
targeting of ethnic and religious minorities, including individuals
and organizations within Tibetan and Uyghur communities. As
highlighted within this report, in recent years RedAlpha has also
displayed a particular interest in spoofing political, government,
and think tank organizations in Taiwan, likely in an effort to
gather political intelligence.

• Amnesty International

Over the past 3 years, Recorded Future has observed
RedAlpha continuing to conduct credential-phishing activity
using large clusters of operational infrastructure to support
campaigns. Over this period, the group displayed a consistent
set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In late
2019 and early 2020, the group likely shifted away from older
infrastructure TTPs exhibited in public reporting, such as the
registration of domains through GoDaddy and hosting on Choopa
(Vultr) and Forewin Telecom infrastructure, and toward those
described in the following section.

this means they were intended to target individuals directly
affiliated with these organizations rather than simply imitating
these organizations to target other third parties. In other cases,
the phishing pages used generic login pages for popular mail
providers and the intended targeting was ambiguous. The
group has used basic PDF files containing links to the identified
phishing sites, typically stating that a user needs to click the link
to preview or download files.

Targeting of Humanitarian Organizations and Think
Tanks
As noted, RedAlpha has regularly registered domains imitating
humanitarian organizations and think tanks, including MERICS,
FIDH, Amnesty International, RFA, and multiple Taiwanese think
tanks. Of particular note, the registration of at least 16 domains
spoofing MERICS from early to mid-2021 coincided with the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) imposing sanctions
on the Berlin-based think tank in March 2021.

RedAlpha’s Consistent Focus on Taiwan
Over the past 3 years, we observed RedAlpha consistently
register domains spoofing Taiwanese or Taiwan-based
government, think tank, and political organizations. Notably, this
included the registration of multiple domains imitating the AIT,
the de facto embassy of the United States of America in Taiwan,
during a time of increasing US-China tension regarding Taiwan
over the past year. Similar to wider activity, these domains were
used in credential-phishing activity using fake login pages for
popular email providers such as Outlook, as well as emulating
other email software such as Zimbra used by these particular
organizations (see Figure 6). A sample list of typosquat domains
seen spoofing Taiwanese organizations is included in Table 1.

As noted in PWC’s 2021 year-in-review report, RedAlpha’s
activity has expanded over the past several years to include
credential-phishing campaigns spoofing ministries of foreign
affairs in multiple countries. We observed phishing pages
imitating webmail login portals for Taiwan and Portugal’s MOFAs
(see Figures 7 and 8), as well as multiple domains spoofing Brazil
and Vietnam’s MOFAs. The previous section also highlighted
consistent use of domains imitating the AIT. The group has also
consistently spoofed login pages for India’s National Informatics
Centre (NIC), which manages wider IT infrastructure and services
for the Indian government.

Attribution
We identified multiple overlaps with previous publicly
reported RedAlpha campaigns that allowed us to assess this is
very likely a continuation of the group’s activity. Of note, in at
least 5 instances the group appeared to re-register previously
owned domains after expiry. An alternative hypothesis we
considered is whether a separate actor registered these domains
in an attempt to emulate RedAlpha activity and conduct similar
credential-theft targeting in line with Chinese state interests.
However, based on additional evidence linking this more recent
activity to historically reported campaigns, we believe that
this is unlikely and that it instead constitutes a continuation
of RedAlpha activity. The re-registration of previously owned
domains may instead be a product of multiple factors such as
the sheer volume of domains registered by the group, poor
infrastructure management, and the repetitive nature of naming
conventions used. Some of the attribution evidence we observed
is summarized below and displayed in Figure 9.
• The domain mydrive-google[.]online was observed in
Citizen Lab’s original reporting on the group and was
originally registered using the email address deepcliff@
sina[.]com . This same domain was observed in more
2021 RedAlpha activity and was hosted on the VirMach
IP address 172.245.81[.]180 alongside a host of other
RedAlpha domains spoofing entities such as MERICS and
FIDH.
• The domain edit-yahoo[.]space was also originally
referenced in Citizen Lab and Recorded Future reporting
on RedAlpha activity, and was later hosted on VirMach
IP address 107.172.39[.]25 in 2021 alongside additional
RedAlpha domains spoofing organizations such as Radio
Free Asia.

• Another domain seen in earlier RedAlpha activity,
mail-protect[.]space , was reregistered and hosted on
then-dedicated infrastructure on 45.114.125[.]130 in
2018. This IP concurrently hosted the similarly named
mail-method[.]space . Mail-method[.]space was later
hosted on the Forewin Telecom IP address 118.99.51[.]31
in mid-2018. This IP address is used for command

microbug[.]info . Both of these domains are linked to
original reporting on RedAlpha activity.

• Another notable aspect of the mail-protect[.]
space domain is that it was originally registered by
evalliang@163[.]com. We associated this email address
with a persona using the moniker Mr. Liang (full name
omitted for the purposes of this report), who was
observed registering domains seen in earlier RedAlpha
activity. Notably, this domain was later reregistered after
expiry using the email address girder1992@hotmail[.]com
. This “girder” handle also has links to historical RedAlpha
activity (see next section on RedAlpha’s Links to Private
Contractor). This, coupled with the malware connection
outlined in the previous point, provides evidence that
the observed cases of domain re-registration were likely
conducted by the same actor.

RedAlpha’s Links to Private Contractor
In our previous public reporting, we identified a link between
RedAlpha and a Chinese information security company. A specific
QQ email address that was used to register multiple RedAlpha
domains also appeared on a job listing for an “information
security engineer” for a company called “Nanjing Qinglan
Information Technology Co., Ltd.” (南京青苜信息技术有限公司)
several years prior. This company, now known as “Jiangsu Cimer
Information Security Technology Co. Ltd.” (江苏君立华域信息安
全技术股份), reportedly provides “security assessment, security
reinforcement, penetration testing, security consulting, offensive
and defensive drills, security training”. The associated persona
linked to the QQ account and on the job listing was listed as “Mr.
Liang/Leung”. Notably, multiple email addresses used to register
early RedAlpha domains referenced in CitizenLab reporting
featured the string “Liang” or ”Leung” and a full registrant name
which matches the owner of the linked QQ account.

• The domain drive-mail[.]space was also registered using
the deepcliff@sina[.]com email address and referenced
in public reporting on the group’s activity. This domain
was later hosted on 115.126.25[.]13 in 2019 alongside

THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Outlook
Our research uncovered the suspected China statesponsored group RedAlpha conducting credential-harvesting
activity targeting individuals and organizations globally, with a
particular focus on civil society and government sectors. The
group has used a consistent set of TTPs to register and manage
large clusters of operational phishing infrastructure, using a
mixture of pages impersonating popular email provider logins
and custom webmail login pages to mimic specific providers and
organizations. Since 2015, the group has engaged in consistent
targeting of individual citizens and groups associated with
minority communities, many of which are subject to reported
human rights abuses within China. More generally, Chinese statesponsored groups continue to aggressively target dissident and
minority groups and individuals, both domestically through state
surveillance and internationally through cyber-enabled intrusion
activity. This targeting of sensitive and vulnerable communities,
many of which have security budget and resources constraints,
is particularly concerning.
