On January 25, 2022 , a victim of a ransomware attack reached out to us for help. The
extension of the encrypted files and the ransom note indicated the TargetCompany
ransomware (not related to Target the store), which can be decrypted under certain
circumstances.

Modus Operandi of the TargetCompany Ransomware
When executed, the ransomware does some actions to ease its own malicious work:
1. Assigns the SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege and SeDebugPrivilege for its process
2. Deletes special file execution options for tools like vssadmin.exe , wmic.exe ,
wbadmin.exe , bcdedit.exe , powershell.exe , diskshadow.exe , net.exe
and taskkil.exe
3. Removes shadow copies on all drives using this command:
%windir%\sysnative\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet

4. Reconfigures boot options:
bcdedit /set {current} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures
bcdedit /set {current} recoveryenabled no

5. Kills some processes that may hold open valuable files, such as databases:

fdhost.exe

sqlserv.exe

fdlauncher.exe

mysql.exe
After these preparations, the ransomware gets the mask of all logical drives in the system
using the GetLogicalDrives() Win32 API. Each drive is checked for the drive type by
GetDriveType() . If that drive is valid (fixed, removable or network), the encryption of the
drive proceeds. First, every drive is populated with the ransom note file (named RECOVERY
INFORMATION.txt ). When this task is complete, the actual encryption begins.

Exceptions
To keep the infected PC working, TargetCompany avoids encrypting certain folders and
file types:

The ransomware generates an encryption key for each file (0x28 bytes). This key splits into
Chacha20 encryption key ( 0x20 bytes ) and n-once ( 0x08 ) bytes. After the file is
encrypted, the key is protected by a combination of Curve25519 elliptic curve + AES-128
and appended to the end of the file. The scheme below illustrates the file encryption. Redmarked parts show the values that are saved into the file tail after the file data is encrypted:

The exact structure of the file tail, appended to the end of each encrypted file, is shown as a
C-style structure:

Every folder with an encrypted file contains the ransom note file. A copy of the ransom note
is also saved into c:\HOW TO RECOVER !!.TXT

The personal ID, mentioned in the file, is the first six bytes of the personal_id, stored in
each encrypted file.

How to use the Avast decryptor to recover files
To decrypt your files, please, follow these steps:
1. Download the free Avast decryptor. Choose a build that corresponds with your
Windows installation. The 64-bit version is significantly faster and most of today’s
Windows installations are 64-bit.
If you have 64-bit Windows, choose the 64-bit build.
If you have 32-bit Windows, choose the 32-bit build.
2. Simply run the executable file. It starts in the form of a wizard, which leads you
through the configuration of the decryption process.
3. On the initial page, you can read the license information, if you want, but you really
only need to click “Next”

1. On the next page, select the list of locations which you want to be searched and
decrypted. By default, it contains a list of all local drives:

6/11

1. On the third page, you need to enter the name of a file encrypted by the
TargetCompany ransomware. In case you have an encryption password created by a
previous run of the decryptor, you can select the “I know the password for decrypting
files” option:

1. The next page is where the password cracking process takes place. Click “Start”
when you are ready to start the process. During password cracking, all your available
processor cores will spend most of their computing power to find the decryption
password. The cracking process may take a large amount of time, up to tens of hours.
The decryptor periodically saves the progress and if you interrupt it and restart the
decryptor later, it offers you an option to resume the previously started cracking
process. Password cracking is only needed once per PC – no need to do it again for
each file.

8/11

1. When the password is found, you can proceed to the decryption of files on your PC by
clicking “ Next ”.

9/11

1. On the final wizard page, you can opt-in whether you want to backup encrypted files.
These backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This
option is turned on by default, which we recommend. After clicking “ Decrypt ”, the
decryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes.
