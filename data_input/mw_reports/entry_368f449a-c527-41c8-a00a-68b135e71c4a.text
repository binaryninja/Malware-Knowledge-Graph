View infographic: Zloader Campaigns at a Glance

The ZBOT (aka Zeus) trojan has been one of the most prolific and enduring malware families
of the past 20 years. After its first appearance in 2006, its source code was leaked in 2011,
leading to a plethora of new variants that plagued organizations over the succeeding years.
One of the most notable recent ZBOT variants is Zloader. First compiled under the name
Silent Night in late 2019, it has evolved from being an information stealer to a multipurpose
dropper that provides malicious actors the means to install and execute other malware and
tools such as Cobalt Strike, DarkSide, and Ryuk. In addition, it has other capabilities, such
as the ability to provide remote access to attackers and install plug-ins for additional routines.
Zloader has multiple delivery methods, such as via email campaigns or downloads by other
malware and hacking tools. One of the most basic yet reliable methods for individuals and
organizations to avoid being infected by Zloader and other malware with similar arrival
techniques is to apply security best practices to their emails. This includes avoiding
downloading attachments or selecting links from emails that look suspicious or appear to be
out of context.
Zloader’s versatility has made it a popular and effective campaign tool for any threat actor
that is willing to pay for it. We already witnessed this in past campaigns — some of which
took advantage of current events such as the Covid-19 pandemic — and we can expect to
see it again in future campaigns from other threat actors.
Organizations can mitigate the impact of Zloader by employing robust security solutions and
services. Trend Micro’s robust native XDR capabilities are tied together by Trend Micro
Vision One™, which connects email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks in
2/12

order to provide a better context and perspective of the entire chain of events of an attack,
while also allowing security personnel to investigate and act from a single place.
Furthermore, managed security services, such as Trend Micro™ Managed XDR, provides
expert threat monitoring, correlation, and analysis from experienced cybersecurity
professionals via a single and capable source of detection, analysis, and response. This
expertise is further bolstered by AI-optimized, Trend Micro solutions that draw from global
threat intelligence.

API from user32.dll and
ntdll.dll to redirect
execution to Zloader
DLL

Persistence

T1060 - Registry Run
Keys/Startup Folder

Creates persistence using the following
registry: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\
Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

T1055 - Process
Injection

msiexec.exe

T1547- Boot
or Logon
Autostart
Execution
Privilege
Escalation

4/12

Defense
Evasion

T1027 - Obfuscated files
or information

T1140 –
Deobfuscate/
Decode Files
or
Information

Zloader performs XOR
to decode obfuscated
strings and information

T1497 Virtualization/
Sandbox
Evasion

Zloader downloader
scripts check if it is
running in a virtual
environment and will not
execute properly if it is

Credential
Access

T1056 - Input Capture

T1539 Steal Web
Session
Cookie

Zloader steals cookies
from Chrome, Firefox,
and Internet Explorer

Instead of presenting arithmetic functions in a
standardized manner and directly hardcoding
constants, Zloader tries to confuse the analyst
by obfuscating these in a form of various,
dedicated functions

Zloader captures keystrokes on browsers

5/12

Discovery

T1083 - File and
Directory Discovery

Zloader steals cookies by discovering files from
specific directories like \Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles

T1185 - Man in the
Browser

Zloader has to install its own (fake) certificate,
and has to run a local proxy before deploying a
Man-In-TheBrowser (MITB) attack

T1012 Query
Registry
Collection

T1179 Hooking

6/12

Command &
Control

T1001 - Data
Obfuscation

C2 is encrypted via RC4 and XORing algorithm
where each character of the string is XORed
with the preceding character which was already
XORed

7/12

T1090 Proxy

T1071Application
Layer
Protocol

Zloader components
injected into browsers
are responsible for
redirecting traffic via
proxy
The following
commands are
accepted:
user_execute download an executable
into the %TEMP% folder
and run it (optionally
with parameters)
user_cookies_get - steal
cookies from all known
browsers
user_url_block - block
URL access for the
current user
bot_uninstall - complete
removal of the bot from
the current user

targeted browsers
user_files_get – search
and upload documents
of the victims (.txt,
docx,, .xls, .wallet.dat)

T1219 Remote
Access
Software

Zloader downloads and
executes VNC tool to
control victim machine

Exfiltration

T1041 - Exfiltration Over
C&C Channel

Data collected by Zloader, such as stolen
cookies, screenshot, and process list, are
exfiltrated to C&C server
