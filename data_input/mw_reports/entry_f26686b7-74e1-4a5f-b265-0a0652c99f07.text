Summary
Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 or Ajax, is an Iranian cyberespionage group active since 20141.
Their primary targets are Iranian experts working in the Academy, human rights activists and media
personnel. Most victims are in the Middle East, US and the UK. Below here is a key event timeline:
•

In 2015 ClearSky discovered the first wave of phishing attacks and issued a report reviewing
their activity named "Thamar reservoir" 2.

•

In 2017 ClearSky exposed a vast espionage operation, active from 2016 to 2017, against the
aforementioned sectors. Our report uncovered incidents of corporate impersonation, fake
organizations and individuals, spear phishing and watering hole attacks.

•

In 2018, Charming Kitten attempted to attack ClearSky and our customers directly via a
fraudulent website impersonating the ClearSky portal3.
Later that year we also identified new wave of attacks against researchers in the Middle
East, using fake emails and look-alike websites.

•

In 2019 ClearSky observed a sharp increase in Charming Kitten attacks. It appears that group
has initiated a new cyber espionage campaign comprised of two stages, pointing at two
different targets:
o

Non-Iranian Researchers from the US, Middle East and France, focusing on academic
research of Iran.

o

Iranian dissidents in the US.

Despite the considerable unrest in the Iranian cyber sphere, it appears that similarly to the
MuddyWater APT, Charming Kitten were unaffected4.
In August, the campaign has progressed, and unlike July, it seems like the APT group is now expanding
its activities toward influential public figures around the world, rather than academic researchers an
state organizations. Additionally, in August 2019, we found that the group had begun adding a tracker
to their email correspondences, enabling them to follow an email message forwarded to additional
accounts and obtain geolocation information.

Attack Vector
1.

The first stage is sending an email message leveraging social engineering methods. The
hacker impersonates a well-known researcher or journalist and invites the recipients to an
event allegedly organized by the impersonated subject. Note that in certain cases, the
hackers use their targets’ language.

2.

The second stage includes a decoy website impersonating various Google services such as
Gmail or Google Drive, to which the victim is redirected from the phishing email. This vector
was observed in prior campaigns as well. Please note that in late March 2019, Microsoft filed
an official complaint against the group for “establishing an internet-based cyber theft
operation referred to as 'Phosphorus'.".5

3.

Moreover, we identified a new vector of phishing websites that is used by this group –
impersonating the Instagram official website. This is the first time we observed an attempt to
extract credentials of non-google services.

Emails sent to victims
Analyzing this campaign, we identified two attack scenarios. Based on our investigation, Charming
Kitten tried to carry out both of the attack scenarios against the same victims. Note however that in
most cases, the attack begun with the first scenario.

First set of Emails
While impersonating to research institution, the attackers try to contact the victims privately and
encourage them to review their resume (CV). In order to do so, linked within the email is a unique URL
address for the fake website (Please notice the spelling and grammatical error, most notably the
mispronunciation of the Sender name. Instead of Andrea, as written in the email address, the attacker
mistakenly wrote Andera):

As this link is not malicious, we believe that it is currently used only as the first stage in the attack gaining the trust of the victims. The website contains the exact page from the original website on
which it is based, with one single change – the sender’s email address embedded within the website
content.

Same as the original website, the email is embedded in the webpage content with a javascript code
encoded in decimal. The attackers changed the last 22 numbers – from isis-online[.]org to the fake
email address isis-online[.]net, as seen below:

The Fake email code in decimal as presented in the source code of the impersonating website:
['>','a','/','<',' 114',' 101',' 107',' 99',' 105',' 114',' 116',' 83',' 32',' 97',' 101',' 114',' 100',' 110',' 65','>','\"',' 116',' 101',' 110','

Second set of Emails
In this scenario, the attackers impersonate a known journalist. Unlike the first format, the latter does
not contain any link to a fake website. The attacker offers the victim to participate in an online meeting
about Iran and other subjects of interest for the target (e.g. recent discourse between Iran and the US).
After presenting himself and the subject of the meeting, the attacker would ask whether the victim is
interested in participating. If so, they are requested to replay in order to receive the following details:
1.

A list of the other participants.

2.

Date and time for the meeting.

3.

Details regarding the method of payment.

We identified on the website URLScan a few scans of a link from the website of Deutcshe Welle, a
Germany-based international news portal. As presented in the following image, the victims were
redirected to the website from malicious domains of the group (which can be found on the ClearSky
Twitter account6). One of the domains is dw[.]de – a decoy domain which was mentioned in the
previous email.

This link was scanned via URLScan by an anonymous user less than a month days ago, which might
reveal another attack by Charming Kitten7.
A second wave of attacks using the same vector took place in August. The attackers sent multiple
email messages in a single night to multiple potential victims, impersonating a woman called
Samantha Vinograd from who works at CNN.
Similarly to the previous attack wave, the email message distributed to the victims contained multiple
spelling mistakes, especially in the names of the reporters the attackers impersonated. For example,
in the email address used to send the decoy emails is the last name of the reporter is misspelled.
Below here is the phishing email’s content:
*Hello ** *
*I'm Samantha Vinograd, CNN national security analyst**.*
*CNN News intends to interview some of Israel's successful figures abroad
and broadcast it as a documentary. We have interviewed some of the leading
Israeli figures in the US, Europe and other countries and are very eager to
meet you.*
*Your humanitarian and political activities have determined us to produce a
short documentary of your life and your family.*
*You can specify the time and place of the first meeting for the
documentary pre-production stage.*
* Please advise me of any special mobility or dietary requirements you may
have. I hope you are able to accept this invitation and I look forward to
hearing from you.*
*Samantha Vinograd*
*CNN National Security Analyst* ,
*Author of @CNN Presidential Weekly Briefing*

An analysis of the email’s headers reveals that the attackers planted an email tracker within the
message. The tracker can be seen below:

The tracker is used by the attackers to check whether the message is forwarded to additional
recipients, and to obtain the geolocation and IP address of the victim. Data is collected via a cookie
that is installed on the victim machine in the following route:

Attack Infrastructure: C&C Servers, Domains and Attribution
We Identified more than six unique servers hosting the fake Charming Kitten websites. Of which, four
impersonate entities as part of the first stage, while the other two host servers impersonating Google
services. We asses that these are likely to be used as in second stage of the attack – data theft.

After a month of campaign operations, The attackers switched the servers used to store the email
addresses, containing thousands of addresses.

Please note that in recent days, many Iranian citizens protested in front the office of the National Iranian
American Council. They protested against the organization, claiming that it is does not represent the Iranian
community in the US.

It should be noted that these domains can only be accessed via the aforementioned link in the spearphishing email. In any other case, the server will redirect the client to the original website (HTTP 302
in port 442 or 301 in port 80). The following image presents the headers of 185.141.63[.]160 from
Shodan9. The fake domain is unirsd[.]com, however, it redirects to the original website.

The server 185.141.63[.]135 is the only server that pointing to 2 domains:
1)

leslettrespersanes[.]net which is impersonating the French magazine “Les Lettres Persanes”.

2)

Inztaqram[.]ga which is impersonating Instagram company. This is the first time we
observed a phishing website executed by Charming Kitten that impersonate non-google
services in order to steal credentials from the victim to other services.

All of the servers used in the latest attack are hosted by BelCloud Hosting Corporation, located in
Bulgaria (ISP Kiwi Technologies Ltd.). Older servers in the campaign, such as 46.21.150[.]197, are
hosted by other hosting services.
As presented in the last image, all servers are Apache/2.4.39 (Win64), using OpenSSL/1.1.1b and PHP
versions 7.3.5 or 7.3.6.

Searching other servers with these unique parameters returned less than 300 results. Most of these
results are not malicious. We ruled out the legitimate servers that pointed in their redirect to the same
IP address or to a domain the server hosts. Within these servers, we identified one server that redirects
to Google services, which concurrently hosts two Iranians Name Servers. We consider this server to be
part of this campaign in medium-high level of confidence:

First and foremost, it should be noted that the Iranian cyber divisions use servers belonging to Hetzner
Online GmbH in many of their operations10. Second, there is an overlap of the server version, the SSL
version, the PHP version and even the serial number of the SSL certificate.

Attribution
We made an attribution to the Iranian Charming Kitten group based on three main factors:
1.

The two main websites linked in the second scenario are:
•

The Jewish Journal (Please see for further information).

•

German magazine - Deutsche Welle.

In March 2019, ClearSky identified another attack as part of this campaign, using an email address
pointing to jewishjournal[.]online. From the Passive DNS records of this domain, we identified another
domain impersonating Deutsche Welle – deutcshewelle[.]net.

Based on passive DNS records, it seems that Charming Kitten used the decoy Jewish Journal domain
once again in July 2019:

2.

As mentioned, the victims are non-Iranian investigators based in the US, Middle East and
France. Their field of expertise fits Charming Kitten’s TTPs. The repeating spelling mistakes
in the email content are also evidence of the Charming Kitten line of action.

3.

The impersonation to NIAC indicates that it is an Iranian actor.

Apart from the above reasons, additional information also ties the group’s activity to Iran. One the
NetBlock of the IP addresses of the original servers we found the website exnovin[.]org. ExNovin is an
Iranian company that developed a platform for money exchange. The domain was previously hosted
on Hetzner, a German Internet hosting company. We estimate that these factors are likely related to
the Charming Kitten group.
