Elastic users are protected from supply chain attacks targeting the 3CX users
How the execution flow operates is actively being investigated by Elastic Security
Labs and other research teams
Irrespective of the anti-malware technology you are using, shellcode and process
injection alerts for 3CX should not be added to exception lists

Preamble
On March 29, 2023, CrowdStrike reported a potential supply-chain compromise affecting
3CX VOIP softphone users as detailed in a Reddit post. Elastic Security Labs continues to
monitor telemetry for evidence of threat activity and will provide updates as more evidence
becomes available. The earliest period of potentially malicious activity is currently
understood to be on or around March 22, 2023 as reported by Todyl.
3CX states it is used by over 600,000 companies and over 12,000,000 users, so Elastic
Security Labs is releasing a triage analysis to assist 3CX customers in the initial detection
of SUDDENICON, with follow-on malware and intrusion analysis to be released at a later
date.
In this informational update, Elastic Security Labs provides the following:
Potential malicious domains associated with malware activity
File hashes for 3CX Windows and MacOS clients which may be impacted
Elastic queries and prebuilt protections which may be relevant to this activity
YARA rules to identify the SUDDENICON malware

SUDDENICON triage analysis
The 3CXDesktopApp installer MSI appears to contain malicious code which waits seven
days post-installation before downloading additional files from GitHub and communicating
with malicious command-and-control domains. The client application writes ffmpeg.dll and
d3dcompiler_47.dll to disk, the latter of which contains a payload we refer to as
SUDDENICON. Both libraries in our sampling appear to have been backdoored. It should
be noted that ffmpeg.dll and d3dcompiler_47.dll are both legitimate file names and rules
should not be created on them alone.

ffmpeg.dll referencing the d3dcompiler_47.dll file
The ffmpeg.dll binary extracts SUDDENICON from d3dcompiler_47.dll by seeking the
FEEDFACE byte sequence and decrypting using a static RC4 key (3jB(2bsG#@c7). The
resulting payload is then loaded in memory as the second-stage payload. A shellcode stub
prepended to the payload used to map it into memory shares similarities with APPLEJEUS
loader stubs, which have been associated with DPRK. Upon successfully executing, this
shellcode stub writes a new file (manifest) to disk with a timestamp 7 days in the future,
used to implement a timer after which the malware connects to the C2 infrastructure.

loading the d3dcompiler_47.dll file
C2 domains are retrieved by downloading and base64-decoding the trailing bytes appended
to icon files staged in the IconStorages Github repository (this repository has been removed
by Github). This repo was created by GitHub ID 120072117 on December 8, 2022, and
most recently updated on March 16, 2023. After initially connecting to an active C2 server,
the malware performs a POST containing a machine identifier. It then downloads and
decrypts a new executable.

SUDDENICON downloading a new executable
Initial analysis of the new executable appears to be an information stealer. We’ll release an
update once the analysis has been completed.

3/10

The CEO of 3CX has recommended uninstalling the software; a small number of
community forum posts outline how security tooling is reacting to potential malware
behaviors, and CrowdStrike and SentinelOne have published initial information. It appears
likely that the threat was able to introduce adversary-created malicious software via update
channels, overwriting otherwise benign components of the 3CXDesktopApp. Users may
accidentally self-infect, as well.

Hunting queries

4/10

The events for both KQL and EQL are provided with the Elastic Agent using the Elastic
Defend integration. Hunting queries could return high signals or false positives. These
queries are used to identify potentially suspicious behavior, but an investigation is required
to validate the findings.
KQL queries
The following KQL query can be used to identify 3CX-signed software performing name
resolution of raw.githubusercontent.com, where malicious applications related to this threat
have been staged:
process.name : "3CXDesktopApp.exe" and dns.question.name :
"raw.githubusercontent.com"

The following KQL query can be used to identify several host-based indicators of this
activity:
dll.hash.sha256 :
"7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896" or
dll.hash.sha256 :
"c485674ee63ec8d4e8fde9800788175a8b02d3f9416d0e763360fff7f8eb4e02"

EQL queries
Using the Timeline section of the Security Solution in Kibana under the “Correlation” tab,
you can use the below EQL queries to hunt for behaviors similar
The following EQL query can be used to profile 3CX software and child software:
any where process.code_signature.subject_name == "3CX Ltd" or
process.parent.code_signature.subject_name == "3CX Ltd"

The following EQL query can be used to identify 3CX-signed software performing name
resolution of raw.githubusercontent.com, where malicious applications related to this threat
have been staged:
network where process.code_signature.subject_name == "3CX Ltd" and dns.question.name
== “raw.githubusercontent.com”

The following EQL query can be used to identify files written by the 3CXDesktopApp client:
file where event.type == "creation" and (host.os.type == "windows" and file.path :
"*:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\C3XDesktopApp\\app\\*" and file.name :
("manifest")) or (host.os.type == "macos" and file.path : "*/Library/Application
Support/3CX Desktop App/" and file.name : ("UpdateAgent", ".main_storage",
".session-lock")

The following EQL query can be used to identify several host-based indicators of this
activity:
5/10

sequence by host.name, process.entity_id
[process where process.code_signature.subject_name:"3CX Ltd"]
[library where
dll.hash.sha256:"c485674ee63ec8d4e8fde9800788175a8b02d3f9416d0e763360fff7f8eb4e02","7
[network where dns.question.name:"raw.githubusercontent.com"]

The following EQL query can be used to identify this activity if the DLL is updated:
library where process.code_signature.subject_name : "3CX Ltd" and not
dll.code_signature.trusted == true and not startswith~(dll.name, process.name) and
/* DLL loaded from the process.executable directory */ endswith~(substring(dll.path,
0, length(dll.path) - (length(dll.name) + 1)), substring(process.executable, 0,
length(process.executable) - (length(process.name) + 1)))

YARA
Elastic Security Labs has released two YARA signatures for the malicious shellcode, which
we refer to as SUDDENICON.

Defensive recommendations
Elastic Endgame and Elastic Endpoint customers with shellcode protections enabled in
prevention mode blocked the execution of SUDDENICON, though any compromised client
software may need to be removed. Due to the delayed shellcode retrieval and injection,
3CXDesktopApp users may not see alerts until the sleep interval passes (approximately 7
days). Customers who are using shellcode protections in detect-only mode should enable
prevention to mitigate the risk of infection. Do not create exceptions for these alerts.
