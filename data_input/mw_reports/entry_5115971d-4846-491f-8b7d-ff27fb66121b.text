APT-C-36: Continuous Attacks Targeting Colombian Government Institutions and
Corporations

威胁情报中心 | 事件追踪

2019-02-18 By 360

Background
Since April 2018, an APT group (Blind Eagle, APT-C-36) suspected coming from South
America carried out continuous targeted attacks against Colombian government
institutions as well as important corporations in ﬁnancial sector, petroleum industry,
professional manufacturing, etc.
Till this moment, 360 Threat Intelligence Center captured 29 bait documents, 62 Trojan
samples and multiple related malicious domains in total. Attackers are targeting Windows
platform and aiming at government institutions as well as big companies in Colombia.
The ﬁrst sample being captured was in April 2018 and since that we observed a lot more
related ones. Attackers like to use spear-ﬁshing email with password protected RAR
attachment to avoid being detected by the email gateway. Decryption password is
provided in the mail body and inside the attachment it is a MHTML macro based document
with the .doc sufﬁx. Its purpose is to implant Imminent backdoor and gain a foothold into
the target network which may make the follow up lateral movement easier to implement.
After analyzing the last modiﬁed time of the encrypted documents, character set (locale) of
the MHTML ﬁles, author names used by attackers, as well as elements like geopolitics in
APT attacks, 360 Threat Intelligence Center suspect attackers come from South America
and are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).

Target and Victim Analysis
After performing investigations on the classiﬁed victims, we ﬁnd the attacker targets big
companies and government agencies in Colombia. The purpose is to implant Imminent
backdoor to gain a foothold into the target network which may make the follow up lateral
movement easier to implement. Based upon victims’ backgrounds, the attacker is focusing
on strategic-level intelligence and may also have motivations to steal business intelligence
and intellectual properties.

Spoofed Source and Industry Distribution
Based on the statistics of the attack information collected by 360 Threat Intelligence
Center, the attacker disguised as Colombian national institutions to attack government
agencies, ﬁnancial institutions, large domestic companies and multinational corporation
branches in Colombia.

Some malicious domains used by the attacker also masquerade as Colombian
government websites. For example, “diangovcomuiscia.com” looks like the ofﬁcial one
“muiscia.dian.gov.co” that belongs to the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs.
The attacker also forged the company information in the Imminent RAT:

Affected Targets
After monitoring and correlating the APT attack, 360 Threat Intelligence Center discovered
multiple related emails to attack Colombian government agencies, ﬁnancial institutions
and large enterprises. Based upon the above work, we collected the following spearﬁshing emails, bait documents and the corresponding victims.

Ecopetrol

Technical Details
360 Threat Intelligence Center conducted a detailed analysis of the attack process based
on the common attack techniques used by the APT group.

The Latest Attack
On February 14, 2019, 360 Threat Intelligence Center monitored attacks by the APT group
again. The corresponding mail was not found by using the recently captured bait
document (MD5:0c97d7f6a1835a3fe64c1c625ea109ed). However, after investigation we
found another similar bait document (MD5: 3de286896c8eb68a21a6dcf7dae8ec97) and
related target attack mail (MD5: f2d5cb747110b43558140c700dbf0e5e). The mail was
disguised from the Colombian National Civil Registry and attacked the Colombian National
Institute for the Blind.

Email attacking the Colombian National Institute for the Blind

Spoofed Source and Detection Bypass
When attacking different targets, attackers carefully consider how to spoof the source of
the message to make it look more credible. For example, by masquerading the National
Civil Registry to attack the Institute for the Blind, pretending to be the Tax and Customs
Administration to attack companies with international trade, disguising as the judiciary and
immigration authorities against banks and multinational corporation branches located in
Colombia.
The attacker also carefully constructs the content of the message to appear originating
from the forged institution and relating to the target. The following picture shows the
translation of the corresponding mail disguised as originating from the judiciary of
Colombia to attack the ATH Colombia branch.

The email attachment is encrypted and stored in the compressed package, and a
decryption password is provided in the mail body to bypass the security detection of the
email gateway.

Decryption password provided in the email
After analyzing the mail, we found that the attacker used approaches such as proxy and
VPN to hide its IP address when sending emails. So the sender’s real IP has not yet been
obtained, only to ﬁgure out that these messages are sent through IDCs in Florida, USA.
Some related IP addresses are as follows:
128.90.106.22
128.90.107.21
128.90.107.189
128.90.107.236

128.90.114.5
128.90.115.28
128.90.115.179

The Bait Document
All of the bait documents are MHTML ones with malicious macro embedded and the .doc
sufﬁx to bypass detection. Below is an example of bait document captured by 360 Threat
Intelligence Center in February 2019:

MHTML macro based document with the .doc sufﬁx

The document is disguised from the Colombian National Civil Registry and uses Spanish
to prompt the victim to enable the macro code in order to execute the subsequent payload.
When the macro code gets executed, it calls the Document_Open function automatically.

Function Document_Open ﬁrst calls the Main function to download binary data from
hxxp://diangovcomuiscia.com/media/a.jpg and save as %AppData%\1.exe (MD5:

Attack
Tactics

1.Compromise website in Spanish or register privacy-protected domain to store pay‐
load for delivery;
2.Spear-ﬁshing email with password protected attachment and MHTML macro based
document to bypass detection;
3.Disguised as national agencies in Colombia to attack Colombia’s government, ﬁnan‐
cial institutions, large domestic companies or Colombian branches of multinational cor‐
porations;
4.Commercial Trojan Imminent is used to remotely control the target;

Attribution
After analyzing the last modiﬁed time of the encrypted documents, character set (locale) of
the MHTML ﬁles, as well as elements like geopolitics in APT attacks, 360 Threat
Intelligence Center suspect attackers are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).

The Reliable Last Modiﬁed Time
Since RAR will save the modiﬁed time of the ﬁle, the time of the document obtained after
decryption is very reliable. Take password protected RAR archive (Registraduria Nacional
del Estado Civil -Proceso inicado.rar) as an example, the time after decryption is the same
as the left one located in the MHTML meta data (the last modiﬁed time on the right side
needs to be reduced by 8 hours since we are in the UTC +8 time zone).

By comparing each last modiﬁed time of the RAR archive with the one located in the meta
data, we have conﬁdence to say that the time is not spoofed. So it makes sense to
perform related statistics of all the bait documents captured.

Statistics of the Last Modiﬁed Time
All of the last modiﬁed time from the captured bait documents are shown in the table
below:
UTC+00
00:32
01:15
01:15
01:17
01:35

From the above we could see that the time never distributed between 05:30 and 12:30,
which supposed to be sleep hours. Combining with the fact that most of the activities are
between 13:00 and 2:00, we suspect attackers are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent
ones).

PE Timestamp
We also performed statistics of timestamps in the dumped PE samples and ﬁgure out they
are not far from the one in the bait documents:

Attacker Proﬁle
Based on the time zone of the attacker, the language being used, and the geopolitical
factors of the APT attack, we come up with following ﬁndings:
1. The time zone (UTC -4) is related to countries in South America.
2. Most of the countries in South America use Spanish (except Brazil), which matches
the attacker’s locale and user names in the bait documents.
3. APT attack could probably be carried out by neighboring countries.
4. The background of the victims and the duration of the attack indicate the attacker
keeps concerned with strategic-level intelligence for a long time.
Above all, 360 Threat Intelligence Center suspect the APT group probably comes from
South American countries with government support.
