New Infostealer ‘ColdStealer’ Being Distributed

February 25, 2022

The ASEC analysis team has discovered the distribution of ColdStealer that appears to be a
new type of infostealer. The malware disguises itself as a software download for cracks and
tools, a distribution method that was mentioned multiple times in previous ASEC blog posts.
There are two cases for this type of malware distribution:
1. Distributing a single type of malware such as CryptBot or RedLine
2. Dropper-type malware decompressing and executing various internal malware strains
ColdStealer was distributed with the second method. For more information, check the
following blog post.
Various Types of Threats Disguised as Software Download Being Distributed
The downloader malware exists within the dropper malware. When the downloader is run, it
downloads ColdStealer from the C2 server. The following figure shows the process.

Figure 1. Infection process of ColdStealer
ColdStealer has a structure of multiple packing layers. It currently uses the .NET obfuscation
packing method, yet it was initially possible to obtain the original version that was built using
process hollowing and .NET load packing method.
As its name suggests, ColdStealer is an infostealer, a simple type of malware that collects
various user information and sends it to C2. It is configured in .NET, and as it has simple
features, its size is a mere 80KB. As the namespace of the sample that appears to have the
original source’s build is “ColdStealer,” the malware was named as such.

When the infostealer collects information that will be stolen, it saves the information in the
ZIP form instead of files in the memory. To do so, it used a source code made public on
GitHub. After collecting the information, it sends memory streams to C2. Doing so will allow
the malware to bypass detection as there are no traces of files and execution.

when collecting information
The infostealer has six main features.
Stealing browser information
Stealing cryptocurrency wallet information
Stealing files
Stealing FTP server information
Stealing system information
Sending exception (error) information
Stealing browser information
Targets are multiple Chromium-based browsers, Opera, and FireFox. The list of targeted
Chromium-based browsers is as follows:
Battle.net, Chromium, Google Chrome, Google Chrome (x86), MapleStudio ChromePlus,
Iridium, 7Star, CentBrowser, Chedot, Vivaldi, Kometa, Elements, Epic, uCozMedia Uran,
Sleipnir5, Citrio, Coowon, Liebao, QIP Surf, Orbitum, Comodo Dragon, Amigo, Torch,
Yandex Browser, Comodo, 360Browser, Maxthon3, K-Melon, Sputnik, Nichrome, CocCoc,
Uran, Chromodo, Atom, BraveSoftware, Microsoft Edge, Nvidia, Steam, CryptoTab
Table 1. List of targets (Chromium-based browsers)

Figure 4. Code for collecting information of Chromium browsers
The code is configured to support browsers to their latest versions. The malware collects
IDs, passwords, cookies, and web data files saved in the browser. Extension programs are
also inquired, meaning the programs on the list are targeted for collecting as well. The list
was found to include sensitive programs related to cryptocurrency wallets or user verification.

Metamask, YoroiWallet, Tronlink, NiftyWallet, MathWallet, Coinbase, BinanceChain,
BraveWallet, GuardaWallet, EqualWallet, JaxxLiberty, BitAppWallet, iWallet, Wombat,
AtomicWallet, MewCx, GuildWallet, SaturnWallet, RoninWallet, PhantomWallet, Arweave,
Auro, Celo, Clover, Coin98, Crypto.com, Cyano, Cyano PRO, Dune, Fractal, Gero,
Harmony, Hiro, Iconex, Kardia Chain, Keplr, KHC, Lamden, Liquality, Maiar, Mew CEX,
Mobox, NeoLine, Nami, Oasis, Polymesh, Rabby, Solflare, Sollet, Solong, Temple, Terra
Station, TezBox, Theta, XDeFi, ZebeDee, Authenticator CC
Table 2. List of browser extension programs for collecting
Instead of stealing entire files, the malware is configured to parse the files internally and
send only the necessary information. Yet as it did not take account of Unicode encoding, an
error occurs when it tries to parse files with information related to browsers (SQLite format) in
Windows that has Korean as the system language.

Figure 5. SQLite parsing error
When the parsing is successful, the browser access record is saved in “Domain.text” while
account IDs and passwords are saved in “Passwords.text”.

Figure 6. Collected browser passwords (example)
Stealing files
Files in the desktop and subdirectories of the user account are targeted. The malware
collects any files that have a “wallet” string or extensions .txt and .dat.

Stealing FTP server information
Collects the list of servers and passwords saved in FileZilla, the most common FTP program.

for collecting FTP server information
Stealing system information
Collects various system information including Windows version, language, CPU type,
clipboard data, execute permission, etc.

Figure 9. Code for collecting system

information
Stealing cryptocurrency wallet information
Collects information of wallet programs saved in Roaming directory, Local directory, registry,
etc.
ZCash, Armory, Bytecoin, JaxxClassic, JaxxLiberty, Exodus, Ethereum, Electrum,
Electrum-LTC, Electrum-BCH, Atomic, Guarda, Wasabi, Daedalus, Coinomi, Litecoin,
Dash, Bitcoin, monero-core, Binance
Table 3. Wallet programs targeted for collection
Collecting and sending error information
Records and sends every error (exception) that occurred while the program was running. As
the SQLite parsing error in Windows with the Korean language setting is also recorded and
sent, the patched version might be distributed soon.

After every process for collecting information is complete, the information is sent to C2. The
URL for sending (C2 URL) is hard-coded in a particular location. The malware uses the
HTTP POST method.

As shown above, ColdStealer is an infostealer with a very simple form that can cause severe
secondary damage by leaking major system information upon infection. Hence users need to
take caution.
