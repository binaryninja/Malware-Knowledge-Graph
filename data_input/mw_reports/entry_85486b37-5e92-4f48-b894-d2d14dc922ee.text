An update on disruption of Trickbot

October 20, 2020

Last week, we announced a disruption targeting the botnet Trickbot. Trickbot is a network of
servers and infected devices run by criminals responsible for a wide range of nefarious
activity including the distribution of ransomware which can lock up computer systems. Our
disruption is intended to disable Trickbot’s infrastructure and make it difficult for its operators
to enable ransomware attacks, which have been identified as one of the biggest threats to
the upcoming U.S. elections. We’ve had many requests for updates on the operation, so I’d
like to share more on how it’s going.
As of October 18, we’ve worked with partners around the world to eliminate 94% of Trickbot’s
critical operational infrastructure including both the command-and-control servers in use at
the time our action began and new infrastructure Trickbot has attempted to bring online.
Here’s how the numbers break down. We initially identified 69 servers around the world that
were core to Trickbot’s operations, and we disabled 62 of them. The seven remaining
servers are not traditional command-and-control servers but rather internet of things (IoT)
devices Trickbot infected and was using as part of its server infrastructure; these are in the
process of being disabled. As expected, the criminals operating Trickbot scrambled to
replace the infrastructure we initially disabled. We tracked this activity closely and identified
59 new servers they attempted to add to their infrastructure. We’ve now disabled all but one

1/3

of these new servers. In sum, from the time we began our operation until October 18, we
have taken down 120 of the 128 servers we identified as Trickbot infrastructure around the
world.
To be clear, these numbers will change regularly as we expect action we’ve already taken
will continue to impact the remaining infrastructure and as we and others continue to take
new action between now and the election. This is challenging work, and there is not always a
straight line to success. At the same time, we’re pleased with our progress and for several
reasons I’m optimistic about the outcomes we can achieve.
First, Microsoft and our partners are trying to take a persistent and layered approach to
addressing Trickbot’s operations around the world. This is necessary due to the unique
architecture of the Trickbot botnet, and the creativity and persistence of the criminals
operating it. Since the initial court order we obtained, we’ve gone back to court and secured
subsequent orders to take down the newly activated infrastructure. We will continue to do
this between now and election day on November 3. Additionally, our partners and the hosting
providers we work with – who have been crucial to our progress – have been sharing
information that has uncovered more command-and-control servers. As we continue to cut
off these new servers, our partners are also working to clean and remediate the
compromised IoT devices, especially routers, that the Trickbot operators are using as nontraditional command-and-control infrastructure. These compromised routers pose a unique
challenge for the internet service providers (ISPs) as they must simultaneously work to
remediate devices while keeping legitimate traffic uninterrupted, and this delicate work is
underway. Finally, we’re working with ISPs and others to also clean devices in people’s
homes and businesses that might be infected.
Second, this work has always been about disrupting Trickbot’s operations during peak
election activity – doing what we can to take action at a critical time – and we’re encouraged
by what we’re seeing. Anytime a botnet’s server infrastructure is eliminated, the attempt to
rebuild is not as simple as setting up new servers. New servers need to be provisioned to
begin talking with the botnet’s infected devices and issuing commands, all of which takes
time. We have identified new Trickbot servers, located their respective hosting provider,
determined the proper legal methodology to take action, and completely disabled those
servers in less than three hours. Our global coordination has allowed a provider to take quick
action as soon as we notify them – in one case, in less than six minutes. What we’re seeing
suggests Trickbot’s main focus has become setting up new infrastructure, rather than
initiating fresh attacks, and it has had to turn elsewhere for operational help.
In fact, we and others have detected the Trickbot operators attempting to use a competing
criminal syndicate to drop what were previously Trickbot payloads. This is one of many signs
that suggests to us that, faced with its critical infrastructure under repeated attack, Trickbot
operators are scrambling to find other ways to stay active. While an arrangement with other
actors will not enable Trickbot to equal its homegrown capabilities, it’s also a reminder that
there are many threats to keeping cyberspace secure and it’s important for people –
2/3

especially those involved in the security of our electoral processes – to stay vigilant. It’s also
why we offer those involved in the election tools such as AccountGuard, Microsoft 365 for
Campaigns and Election Security Advisors.
Third, we have the right team and the right groundwork in place to continue having impact in
the coming weeks. Our Digital Crimes Unit has spent years studying, documenting and
categorizing Trickbot’s infrastructure, identifying which command-and-controls are traditional
servers and which are actually IoT devices. We believe we understand the right details about
Trickbot’s infrastructure to focus our attention on the specific command-and-control servers
that allow for the greatest degree of disruption. Even more importantly, our network of global
partners is monitoring Trickbot’s activities and sharing information around the clock. And we
have members of our Digital Crimes Unit around the world in direct contact with local ISPs
and telecommunications companies.
We fully expect that Trickbot’s operators will continue looking for ways to stay operational,
and we and our partners will continue to monitor them and take action. We encourage others
in the security community who believe in protecting the elections to join the effort and share
their intelligence directly with hosting providers and ISPs that can take Trickbot’s
infrastructure offline. As this work continues, it will be important to focus on the collective
impact to Trickbot’s capabilities between now and the election, rather than to focus on
potentially misleading simplified snapshots from any single moment in time.
