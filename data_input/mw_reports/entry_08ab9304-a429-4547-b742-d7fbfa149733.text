Over the past few years, ransomware has gone wild and organisations around the world are
getting targeted leading to the damage and disruption. As we all know that the threat
landscape is changing rapidly and we hear the fuss about ransomware infection at the
offices or read about it in the news. Have you ever wondered how threat actors are writing
1/17

ransomwares? What level of sophistication and understanding is required to target an
organisation? In this demo, we will utilise the native Windows commands to build
ransomware and target a host via phishing. Introducing Phirautee, a proof of concept crypto
virus to spread user awareness about attacks and implications of ransomwares. Phirautee is
written purely using PowerShell and does not require any third-party libraries. This tool steals
the information, holds an organisation's data to hostage for payments or permanently
encrypts/deletes the organisation data. The tool uses public-key cryptography to encrypt the
data on the disk. Before encrypting, it exfiltrates the files from the network to the attacker.
Once the files are encrypted and exfiltrated, the original files are permanently deleted from
the host and then tool demands a ransom. The ransom is asked using the cryptocurrency for
payments, so transactions are more difficult for law enforcement to trace. During the
demonstration of Phirautee, you will see a complete attack chain i.e. from receiving
ransomware attack via a phishing email and how the files get encrypted on the compromised
systems. A detailed walkthrough of the source code would be provided to understand how
hackers utilise simple methods to create something dangerous. I will end the demo with
several defence mechanisms by performing forensics analysis on Phirautee using publicly
available tools.

2. LEGAL DISCLAIMER 2 • Performing any hack attempts or tests
without written permission from the owner of the computer system is illegal. • If you
recently suffered a breach or targeted by a ransomware and found techniques or tools
illustrated in this presentation similar, this neither incriminates my involvement in any
way, nor implies any connection between myself and the attackers. • The tools and
techniques remain universal and penetration testers and security consultants often
uses them during engagements. • Phirautee project must not be used for illegal
purposes. It is strictly for educational and research purposes and for people to
experiment with.
3. WHOAMI 3 • Over 8 years of experience in the
field of information security and management • Passionate about offensive and
defensive security • Runs a boutique consultancy firm – Preemptive Cybersecurity Pty
Ltd • Technical Manager at RiskIQ for the APAC region • In my free time I develop

6. RECENT RANSOMWARE ATTACKS 6
7. INTRODUCTION TO RANSOMWARE 7 • Ransomware is a class of
malware that uses cryptography algorithms to encrypt files on the infected machine and
later extorts the victim to pay via crypto currency, gift cards, bank transfers or mobile
payments. • Upon payment user may or may not receive a decryption key to retrieve
encrypted files. • Most ransomware attacks are financially motivated. • Most common
way of asking ransom is through cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum
(ETH) or Monero (XMR). • Recent trends shows ransomware authors are moving to
privacy coins such as Monero (XMR). New version of Sodinokibi aka REvil have
decided to abandon Bitcoin and switched to Monero Cryptocurrency.
8. HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM INFECTED? 8 •
Ransomware is usually considered as one of the nosiest attacks. Infection signs are
shown to users through various channels such as desktop wallpaper, notes and
through infection notice. • An alarming window is opened and you cannot close it. •
Below are some examples of ransomware screens:

11. RANSOMWARE AS A SERVICE 11 Malicious attackers or criminals

hacks
into a server or hosts. Make them part of a huge botnet. Puts this machine up for a sale
in the market for others to play around. Ransomware authors buys access to these
compromised hosts and installs backdoors on the system for persistence mechanism.
Malicious attackers then use it for a malware distribution, DDoS attacks, phishing
campaigns, social engineering, fraud, Crypto mining or for a ransom.
12. XDEDIC 12 • xDedic is a great example of one
such marketplace. The service was offering 70k hosts across 173 countries. • Portal
had 416 unique sellers at the time of takedown.

13. LOGS/RDP/SSH/PP/CC/SMB MARKETPLACE 13 • There are number of

market places
out there to buy access to compromised hosts • Selling price for access to government
networks, corporations or universities is as low as low 6$ per host.

average ransom amount paid by a ransomware victim to their attacker - in exchange
for the promise of a decryption tool - increased throughout last year. But from the third
to fourth quarter of 2019, ransom payment amounts skyrocketed, from $41,198 to
$84,116. The median Q4 payment was $41,179. "The doubling of the average reflects
the diversity of the threat actors that are actively attacking companies," – Coveware
Report. Attackers using Ryuk and Sodinokibi - aka REvil - are increasingly focusing
their attacks on large companies where they can attempt to extort the organization for a
seven-figure payout. Note that the average Ryuk ransom payment last quarter was

17. INTRODUCING PHIRAUTEE 17 • Phirautee is a proof of concept
ransomware tool written purely using PowerShell. • It uses Living off the Land (LotL)
commands to work against the operating system to encrypt files on the machine. • This
tool can be used during internal infrastructure penetration testing or during the red
team exercise to validate Blue Team/SOC response to ransom attacks. • It uses public
key cryptography to encrypt user content and exfiltrates large files via Google Drive. •
Upon successful attack the ransomware asks for a payment of 0.10 BTC (~1k USD). •
Detection: • File extension of the encrypted files are changed to “.phirautee” • Desktop
wallpaper of the compromised host is changed with Phirautee background • Desktop
will have Phirautee.txt file
18. PHIRAUTEE ATTACK SETUP 18 • Phishing server and domain to
target an organisation. • Email server to send malicious documents as an attachment to
the targeted user. • Macro embedded file as an attachment to user which pulls the
ransomware from the remote server to targeted machine and runs it in a memory. •
Modify couple of parameters in the ransomware file to utilise it for your use case. • For
data exfiltration: • Throwaway Gmail account • Gmail API access to a throwaway
Google Drive • Setup web application on the Google • Detailed steps for the Google
Drive setup can be viewed at:
https://github.com/Viralmaniar/Phirautee/blob/master/Exfil%20Setup.md
19. USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY IN PHIRAUTEE 19 • Uses 2048 bits
RSA key to encrypt files on the infected machine. • Private key of the certificate gets
sent to attacker using a pre-shared secret aka symmetric keys. Symmetric Key
Cryptography Asymmetric Key Cryptography

15/17

20. SYMMETRIC KEYS & ANON SMTP 20 • Phirautee uses two
unique symmetric keys • One for the private key of the certificate that’s being
generated on the user machine. • The other one for uploading exfiltrated data on
Google Drive • The private keys are sent to Pokemail as a zip encrypted files. •
Phirautee uses Pokemail services to distribute the attack infrastructure by creating a
random location based email address.
21. THINK INNOVATIVE 21 • Can you do your entire attack
in memory? • Can you be more intrusive and silent at the same time? • Can you
compromise a host on the UAC settings of “Always notify”? • Can you delete logs and
clear traces? • Can you perform the entire malicious operation without user interaction?
• Is your code detected by an AV/EDR vendor?
22. TRY UNTIL YOU CAN BYPASS 22
23. DEMO TIME! 23

25. HOW CRIMINALS CONVERT RANSOM TO CASH? 25

https://bitshills.com/best-non-kyc-crypto-exchanges/
26. RANSOMWARE WRITERS ARE NOT PERFECT 26 • Ransomware writers

are
humans too. They make mistakes. • Before paying your ransom make sure your
incident response team performs investigation on the malware behavior. • Some of the
ransomware writers drop encryption/decryption keys on the infected machine itself.
Make your incident response team to analyse the code. • Put a proxy in between and
modify the amount or address. Sometimes you’ll see parameters with value true and
false. Changing them decrypts your files. • Take snapshot of the system before and
after the infection if you have samples. Take note of changes on the system.

16/17

27. RANSOMWARE PROTECTION IN WINDOWS 27 • Ransomware

Protection is disabled
by default • Controlled folder access helps you protect valuable data from malicious
apps and threats. • Controlled folder access feature is included with Windows 10 and
Windows Server 2019. • Directories containing sensitive data should be added to
controlled folder. • In case the malicious application tries to modify or change the
documents in the controlled folder a notification is generated through Microsoft
Defender.
28. MITIGATION STRATEGIES 28 • Network segmentation and detection of

lateral
movement. Follow principle of least privilege access or restrict access to sensitive
servers. Make use of MFA on all important portals. • Disable PowerShell for standard
domain users and perform application whitelisting. • Frequent network wide backups (if
possible offline). • Apply patches and have a vulnerability management program. •
Have a dedicated incident response team and develop a plan for ransomware events. •
Invest in a good IDS/IPS/EDR/AV/CASB product. • Validate the effectiveness of your
defense tools and technologies through pre-approved offensive exercise. • Organise
phishing and user education training sessions for your employees. • Have cyber
insurance to help cover costs in case you need to pay the ransom. Furthermore, get
your insurance policies reviewed to make sure there are no holes. • Take help from
local feds for the decryption keys. https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/
