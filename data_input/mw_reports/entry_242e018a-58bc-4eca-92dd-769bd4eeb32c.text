Introduction
In the past two months, we observed multiple APT groups attempting to leverage the Russia and
Ukraine war as a lure for espionage operations. It comes as no surprise that Russian entities
themselves became an attractive target for spear-phishing campaigns that are exploiting the
sanctions imposed on Russia by western countries. These sanctions have put enormous pressure on
the Russian economy, and specifically on organizations in multiple Russian industries.
Check Point Research (CPR) details a targeted campaign that has been using sanctions-related
baits to attack Russian defense institutes, part of the Rostec Corporation. The investigation shows
that this campaign is part of a larger Chinese espionage operation that has been ongoing against
Russian-related entities for several months. CPR researchers estimate with high confidence that the
campaign has been carried out by an experienced and sophisticated Chinese nation-state APT. In
the below blog, the researchers reveal the tactics and techniques used by the threat actors and
provide a technical analysis of the observed malicious stages and payloads, including previously
unknown loaders and backdoors with multiple advanced evasion and anti-analysis techniques.

Twisted Panda: Chinese APT espionage operation against Russian’s state-owned defense institutes - Check Point Research

CPR unveils a targeted campaign against at least two research institutes in Russia, whose
primary expertise is the research and development of highly technological defense solutions.
Research suggests that another target in Belarus, likely also related to the research field,
received a similar spear-phishing email claiming that the US is allegedly spreading a
biological weapon.
The defense research institutes that we identified as targets of this attack belong to a holding
company within the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corporation. It is
Russia’s largest holding company in the radio-electronics industry and the specific targeted
research institutes’ primary focus is the development and manufacturing of electronic
warfare systems, military-specialized onboard radio-electronic equipment, air-based radar
stations and means of state identification.
This campaign is a continuation of what CPR believes to be a long-running espionage
operation against Russian-related entities that has been in operation since at least June 2021.
The operation may still be ongoing, as the most recent activity was observed in April 2022.
This activity was attributed with high confidence to a Chinese threat actor, with possible
connections to Stone Panda (aka APT10), a sophisticated and experienced nation-statebacked actor, and Mustang Panda, another proficient China-based cyber espionage threat
actor. CPR named this campaign Twisted Panda to reflect the sophistication of the tools
observed and the attribution to China.
The hackers use new tools, which have not previously been described: a sophisticated multilayered loader and a backdoor dubbed SPINNER. These tools are in development since at
least March 2021 and use advanced evasion and anti-analysis techniques such as multi-layer
in-memory loaders and compiler-level obfuscations.

Infection chain
On March 23, malicious emails were sent to several defense research institutes based in Russia.
The emails, which had the subject “ List of <target institute name> persons under
US sanctions for invading Ukraine ”, contained a link to an attacker-controlled site
mimicking the Health Ministry of Russia minzdravros[.]com and had a malicious document
attached:

Each document downloads an external template from the URLs with a similar format, such as
https://www.microtreely.com/support/knowledgebase/article/AIUZGAE7230Z[.]dotm .

The external template contains a macro code that imports several API functions from kernel32
( LoadLibraryA , CreateFileA , WriteFile , ReadFile , etc) and uses them to:
Write three files ( cmpbk32.dll , cmpbk64.dll , and INIT ) to the path:
C:/Users/Public .
Load cmpbk32.dll or cmpbk64.dll (depending on the system OS architecture) and
execute its exported function R1 .
Execution of the exported function R1 finalizes the initialization of the malicious files. The
malware creates a working directory %TEMP%\\OfficeInit and copies to it INIT and
cmpbk32.dll files, as well as a legitimate 32-bit Windows executable cmdl32.exe from either
System32 or SysWOW64 folder, depending on if the operating system is 32 or 64 bit.

Figure 3: The simplified infection chain.

The Loader
The loader is a 32-bit DLL utilizing dynamic API resolving with name hashing for evasion and
anti-analysis. The loader is not only able to hide its main functionality, but also avoid static
detection of suspicious API calls by dynamically resolving them instead of using static imports.
The purpose of cmpbk32.dll is to load specific shellcode from the INIT file, depending on the
infection stage, and run it. The INIT file contains two shellcodes: the first-stage shellcode runs
the persistence and cleanup script, and the second-stage shellcode is a multi-layer loader. The goal
is to consecutively decrypt the other three fileless loader layers and eventually load the main
payload in memory. To distinguish between the stages, the DLL entry point DllMain performs
different actions based on the call reason.

When the malicious document is closed, a PROCESS_DETACH event is triggered. The DLL
executes a portion of the INIT file in charge of cleaning up the files created by the malicious
document and creates a scheduled task for persistence:

Figure 5: Persistence and cleanup function
Loader stage
The main loading process begins with the scheduled task running cmdl32.exe which loads the
malicious DLL cmpbk32.dll . DLL sideloading by a legitimate process is a technique
commonly used by threat actors; coupling it with a robust loading process can help evade modern
anti-virus solutions as, in this case, the actual running process is valid and signed by Microsoft.
Note that the cmpbk64.dll is not copied into the %TEMP%\\OfficeInit folder. The 64-bit
version of the DLL is only used in the initial infection stage by the 64-bit MS Word process, as the
32-bit cmdl32.exe can only load 32-bit cmpbk32.dll .
When the DLL is loaded, the PROCESS_ATTACH event is triggered and starts a sequence of
operations. The sequence peels off multiple encrypted layers from the INIT file and eventually
reveals and executes the final payload. It first reads an XOR-encrypted blob from the INIT file
and decrypts it in memory using a simple XOR with the key 0x9229 . The decrypted blob is a
position-independent code and the first of the encrypted layers that “protects” the main payload.

Figure 6: Layers of decryption performed by the loader to uncover the final payload.
This first layer is rather simple. It dynamically loads from Kernel32.dll the WinAPI functions that
are essential for its work. Next, it begins a sequence of operations to uncover the second layer. It
uses RC4 with the following hardcoded key: 0x1C, 0x2C, 0x66, 0x7C, 0x11, 0xCF,
0xE9, 0x7A, 0x99, 0x8B, 0xA3, 0x48, 0xC2, 0x03, 0x07, 0x55 . It then
decompresses the decrypted buffer using RtlDecompressBuffer and reveals the second layer.

Figure 7: Injection to msiexec.exe
The injected code begins by dynamically loading a PE file embedded inside and executing it from
its entry point.

SPINNER backdoor: technical analysis
The payload uses two compiler-level obfuscations:
Control flow flattening: alters the code flow making it non-linear
Opaque predicates: defines unused logic and causes the binary to perform needless
calculations
Both methods make it difficult to analyze the payload, but together, they make the analysis painful,
time-consuming, and tedious. These two types of obfuscations were previously spotted being used
together in samples attributed to the Chinese-speaking group Stone Panda (APT10) and Mustang
Panda.
Figure 8: Opaque predicate and control flow flattening code obfuscations in the SPINNER sample.
When the SPINNER backdoor starts to run, it creates a mutex called MSR__112 to ensure there
is only one instance of the payload running at a time. The payload also expands the persistence
previously created by the loader. It creates a new registry key OfficeInit under

Next, it sets up its own configuration, which contains the following fields:
struct malware_config {
std::string full_c2_url;

DWORD use_https;
DWORD port;
DWORD sleep_time;
}
The full_c2_url is decrypted using XOR decryption with the key 0x50 . After decryption,
the function InternetCrackUrlA is used to crack a URL into its component parts: the
c2_url_without_scheme , c2_uri , port and use_https fields .
Next, the backdoor starts its main loop by checking if it’s the first run and therefore system
fingerprinting has not yet occurred. If the answer is no, the backdoor creates a random 16-byte Bot
ID and saves it to the file %TEMP%\\OfficeInit\\init.ini . It then collects data about the
infected system and creates a string containing the following data:
Bot ID
Computer name
Local IP
Windows version
Username
Sleep time retrieved from the malware config
Process ID
NULL appended at the end of the string
When it has the string containing all the gathered data, the backdoor prepares a packet to be sent to
the C&C server, constructed in the following way:

Offset

0x0

16 null bytes

0x10

4-byte command ID – 0x10010001

0x14

4 null bytes

0x18

0x1C

Next, the backdoor generates a random 8-byte RC4 key that is used to encrypt the entire packet.
The final packet has this structure:

The packet is sent through the HTTP/S depending on the URL retrieved from the malware
configuration. Similar to the request, the response from the C&C server is encrypted with RC4 and
has the same structure containing the key, size, and data. The C&C response can contain one of the
following commands:

Collect system information and send the data back to the C&C

Judging by the supported commands, this version of the SPINNER backdoor has only basic
capabilities to enumerate the host system. Its main purpose is to run additional payloads received
from the C&C server. While we were not able to get other payloads, based on other findings
described later in the research, we believe that selected victims likely received the full backdoor
with additional capabilities.

Previous campaign
While searching VirusTotal for files similar to the loader, we encountered an additional cluster
which also utilizes DLL sideloading to launch an in-memory loader that is very similar to the one
we discussed previously. It then loads a payload that could be an earlier variant of the SPINNER
backdoor. Judging by the names of the files and compilation stamps of the executables, the
campaign has been active since June 2021.
Unlike the current campaign, which uses Microsoft Word documents as a dropper, the previous
wave of attacks relied on executables bearing the Microsoft Word logo. This suggests these
droppers were intended to be delivered to the victims by the same means as the malicious
documents, via spear-phishing emails, either as attachments or links to fake sites.
The Dropper
The dropper is a 64-bit executable that has a simpler flow than the previously discussed malicious
document:

Figure 9: The Infection chain of the campaign starts with the executable dropper.
First, it extracts the following files from resources: rekeywiz.exe , UnityPlayer.dll and
PIN , and drops them into the working folder C:\\Users\\Public\\PublicPIN . The file
rekeywiz.exe masquerades as a legitimate Windows executable EFS REKEY Wizard, but in
fact, is a Steam gaming platform interactive wallpaper called Sheep. Sheep is a digitally signed
Unity-based application for Steam Wallpaper Engine. Therefore, it can evasively side-load the
malicious loader that imitates Unity dll which in turn loads, decrypts and executes the shellcode
from the PIN file.
The dropper also decrypts from the resources, drops a decoy Word document to
%USER%\\Documents\\offic\\ (the typo is on the actor) and opens it for the victim. All the
decoy documents we observed in different droppers used Russian government-related themes,
such as the Decrees of the President of the Russian Federation, with documents’ names and
content in Russian. It can be assumed that the campaign is also targeting entities in or related to
Russia.

Figure 10: A fragment of the decoy document launched by the dropper.
For persistence, the dropper creates a scheduled task called InterSys that points to
rekeywiz.exe . The code handling this is very similar to the “persistence and cleanup” function
from the loader we described earlier:

The Loader
The older versions of the loader contain debugging information and feature an interesting PDB
path: C:\\D\\StageS\\Release\\HackDll2.pdb .
As the infection chain is simpler, when it is side-loaded by rekeywiz.exe , the loader only
handles the PROCESS_ATTACH event. The payload decryption code for the loader is similar to
the one we described, and it performs the same steps as the new loader: XOR decryption for the
first layer encryption, RC4 decryption for the second layer, and injection to a newly created
msiexec.exe .

cmpbk32.dll XORing bytes from the INIT file (with the keys 0x29, 0x92)
Final payload – full SPINNER backdoor
Many of the functions inside the final payload share similar logic with the SPINNER variant
described above, but the payload lacks the compiler-level obfuscations observed in the newer
campaign making it easier to analyze. Furthermore, the previous version of the backdoor contains
additional features. This is another indication that the initial SPINNER backdoor version we
observed is only a part of the bigger payload. It’s likely the actors eventually split the payload and
only equipped the first stage of the main backdoor with essential functions: enumeration of the
victim’s machine and execution of the next stage payloads received from the C&C server.
The full version of the SPINNER backdoor contains the following capabilities:
Collects information about the infected machine (enumerate disks, files).
Exfiltrates files from the infected machine and manipulates the local files.
Runs OS commands and executes downloaded payload, as part of typical backdoor
capabilities.

Campaign TTPs evolution
In less than a year, the actors significantly improved the infection chain and made it more
complex. All the functionality from the old campaign was preserved, but it was split between
multiple components making it harder to analyze or detect each stage. Here are some examples of
the split components:
The EXE dropper functionality is split between a malicious document and the loader. It’s a
reasonable adjustment as an executable. Even one that masquerades as a document might
raise a lot more suspicion than a carefully crafted document.
Adding more functionality to the DLL loader. Interestingly, the actors chose not to add more
exported functions to the DLL, but to handle different call reasons in DllMain, making some
parts of malicious code run stealthy in the background when the document is closed.
Although the loader contains some anti-analysis and evasion techniques, such as the use of
shellcode and dynamic API resolving using hashed, in the latest campaign the actors added
significant improvements by supplementing complex compiler-level obfuscations to the
SPINNER backdoor.
In addition to the complex obfuscations, the SPINNER backdoor was reduced to only basic
functionality. This was likely done to increase the malware’s stealth and evasion.

Twisted Panda: Chinese APT espionage operation against Russian’s state-owned defense institutes - Check Point Research

As with any unknown malware sample, the SPINNER loader and backdoor analysis required CPR
to determine whether it was a known malware sample or an entirely new malware family. At first
glance, the payload looked similar to the PlugX/Hodur malware described by ESET in a recently
published report on Chinese APT Mustang Panda. The first similarity is in the ID numbering of
C&C commands: both malware use 2 bytes to specify the command category and 2 bytes for a
specific command from this category. For example, the command 0x10010001 is used in the
SPINNER variant to send the system information data, while Hodur malware uses the command
group 0x1001 and command ID 0x1001 for the same action.
In addition, some of the commands themselves overlap between the samples, such as those that list
the logical drives, get detailed information about the files in a directory, or execute commands
using cmd.exe. These functionalities are not unique and can usually be found in many backdoors.
In this case, the two malware share an even greater and more surprising similarity. After opening
the Hodur PlugX variant in the disassembler, it became apparent that Hodur — like SPINNER —
was heavily obfuscated using Control Flow Flattening (CFF). However, Hodur’s CFF is different
from SPINNER’s. Hodur’s CFF relies on a dispatcher that uses a certain register to decide which
code block to jump to next, while in SPINNER the register is used as-is without any manipulation.
In the PlugX variant, additional arithmetic operations are used on the register before it is checked
by the dispatcher. To complete the obfuscation comparison, Hodur heavily obfuscates its API calls
and strings, a step which is absent in SPINNER.

Figure 13: Control flow flattening used in SPINNER variant (on the left) vs control flow flattening
with arithmetic operations on the CFF register used in the Hodur variant (on the right).
In terms of implementation, the malware samples are entirely different. Hodur is a multithreaded
Windows Desktop application and communicates with the C&C through multiple threads, each
with its own purpose, while SPINNER is a single-threaded Console application. Hodur’s
enumeration method is more extensive than SPINNER’s, but it does not use Bot ID which

18/30

6/6/22, 10:24 AM

Twisted Panda: Chinese APT espionage operation against Russian’s state-owned defense institutes - Check Point Research

identifies a specific infected machine. The self-delete function in Hodur might be similar in its
logic to SPINNER, but it uses a completely different set of commands to delete itself and its
associated files. Hodur’s communication logic with the C&C is more complex, drawn from
different parts of the code and from multiple threads, while SPINNER has only has one function
that handles the commands.
While the differences indicate these malware belong to different families, they share “best
practices” similarities. Here are some examples of their similarities:
Both use WS2_32 functions to retrieve the local computer IPv4 address
They show interest in enumeration files in certain directories by looking for specific data
such as the last access time
Both enumerate the disk drives, searching thumb drives for interesting data
They execute commands from the C&C through cmd.exe using a pipe, etc.
It can be argued that those are just common techniques used by all backdoors, but it is not unlikely
that these tools might have the same upstream source and therefore share many best practices and
methods.
Chinese-based activity
The Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of this operation enabled us to attribute it to
Chinese APT activity. In general, Chinese groups are known to reuse and share tools between
them. Without enough strong evidence, such as infrastructure-based connections, we couldn’t
directly attribute this activity with high confidence to any specific Chinese threat actor. However,
the Twisted Panda campaign bears multiple overlaps with advanced and long-standing Chinese
cyberespionage actors:
The control-flow obfuscations observed in SPINNER were previously used by the Chinese
group APT10 and reappeared in a recent Mustang Panda espionage campaign:

(698d1ade6defa07fb4e4c12a19ca309957fb9c40).
APT group Mustang Panda was observed exploiting the invasion of Ukraine to target
Russian entities around the same time as Twisted Panda.
The infection flow relying on DLL side-loading is a favorite evasion technique used by
multiple Chinese actors. Examples include the infamous PlugX malware (and its multiple
variants, including the aforementioned Mustang Panda’ Hodur samples), the recently
published APT10 global espionage campaign that used the VLC player for side-loading, and
other APT10 campaigns.
In addition to the similarities between SPINNER and Hodur that we previously mentioned,
other practices like multi-layer in-memory loaders based on shellcodes and PEs, especially
combined with dynamic API resolutions via hashes, are also a signature technique for many
Chinese groups.

Twisted Panda: Chinese APT espionage operation against Russian’s state-owned defense institutes - Check Point Research

The victimology of the Twisted Panda campaign is consistent with Chinese long-term
interests.

Targets
The defense research institutes that we identified as targets of this attack belong to a holding
company within the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corporation. It is Russia’s
largest holding company in the radio-electronics industry and the specific targeted research
institutes’ primary focus is the development and manufacturing of electronic warfare systems,
military-specialized onboard radio-electronic equipment, air-based radar stations and means of
state identification. The research entities are also involved in avionics systems for civil aviation,
the development of a variety of civil products such as medical equipment and control systems for
energy, transportation, and engineering industries.
The Made in China 2025 plan defines objectives for China to become a major technological and
economic power, and also identifies the sectors in which it must become a world leader, including
robotics, medical equipment, and aviation. To support that, China’s five-year plan for the years
2021-2025 outlines a steady increase in R&D budgets each year in order to expand China’s
scientific and technical capabilities. However, multiple reports – not from the United States and
other countries including Russia, which is considered China’s strategic partner – reveal that
alongside overt relations and measures, China employs covert tools to gather information, thus
combining partnerships with diverse espionage activity. Together with the previous reports of
Chinese APT groups conducting their espionage operations against the Russian defense and
governmental sector, the Twisted Panda campaign described in this research might serve as more
evidence of the use of espionage in a systematic and long-term effort to achieve Chinese strategic
objectives in technological superiority and military power.

Summary
In this report, CPR researchers have described and exposed a Chinese espionage operation named
Twisted Panda which targets defense research institutes in Russia and possibly also in Belarus.
This campaign relies on social engineering techniques and exploits recently imposed sanctions on
Russia to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called SPINNER to specific targets. The
purpose of the backdoor and the operation is likely to collect information from targets inside the
high-tech Russian defense industry to support China in its technological advancement.
As a part of this investigation, we uncovered the previous wave of this campaign, also likely
targeting Russian or Russia-related entities, active since at least June 2021. The evolution of the
tools and techniques throughout this time period indicates that the actors behind the campaign are
persistent in achieving their goals in a stealthy manner. In addition, the Twisted Panda campaign
shows once again how quickly Chinese espionage actors adapt and adjust to world events, using
the most relevant and up-to-date lures to maximize their chances of success.
To help track and research the Twisted Panda campaign, see Appendix A for relevant Yara rules
for all the major components of this attack.
