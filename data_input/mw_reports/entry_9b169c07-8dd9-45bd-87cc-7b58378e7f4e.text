A LETTER
TO OUR
PARTNERS
Fiscal Year 2017 was both eventful and exciting for the National
Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC).
Throughout the year, we were reminded all too frequently
that threats to the Nation’s information and communications
systems remain persistent and extremely dangerous. Yet there
is also room for excitement and optimism because, while much
work remains, NCCIC and our partners made real progress
toward creating a more sustainable, secure, and resilient cyber
and communications environment.
This Fiscal Year 2017 NCCIC Year in Review highlights NCCIC’s
important role in protecting the Nation’s critical information and
communications systems.
Misuse of, threats to, and malicious attacks on these systems
pose some of the most serious and enduring strategic risks to
the United States. The increasing frequency and scale of
malicious cyber activity threatens us all. As more devices
connect to the Internet, the threat landscape broadens and
compounds the challenge for security practitioners.
NCCIC spearheads the Department of Homeland Security’s
operational efforts to reduce systemic risk to our information
technology and operational technology (IT and OT), while

combatting persistent threats from sophisticated adversaries seeking
to compromise our national security. Whether working with partners to
tackle large-scale, global cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya,
or coordinating the restoration of vital telecommunications in the wake
of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, NCCIC is there to help the Nation
prepare for, prevent, protect, and if necessary respond to incidents.
No one agency or organization can secure our homeland alone, however.
Cyber and communications security is a shared responsibility. All of us,
from the biggest government agencies and multinational corporations,
to individual citizens play a part in keeping the Internet safe. Together,
we can improve our collective defense through collaborative, tangible
actions that make the cyber ecosystem safer. NCCIC’s goal is a cyber
environment where a given tactic, such as a malicious email, can only be
used once before all other potential victims block it.

ensure that the NCCIC continues to arm our
customers with the critical information products,
services, and capabilities they require.
I want to thank our partners and the dedicated and
skilled NCCIC team for their tireless work and
contributions to the Nation’s security.

Sincerely,
Jeanette Manfra
Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity
and Communications

In FY17, NCCIC streamlined its product portfolio, further integrated core
functions and capabilities, and improved services to customers in a
number of important ways. We continue to explore ways to enrich cyber
threat indicator data and leverage analytics and automation to improve
the information we deliver to customers. We are also helping customers
improve readiness and technical expertise by enhancing our training
and exercise capabilities. These and other enhancements—together with
the growing strength and breadth of our global partnerships—will help to

JOHN FELKER

RESILIENCE

FORTITUDE

DHS established NCCIC in 2009. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 (NCPA) established NCCIC in
law. Together, NCPA and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 collectively tasked NCCIC with a number of core cybersecurity
functions, including serving as a federal-civilian
VIGILANCE interface for sharing cyber threat indicators, coordinating information
exchange across the Federal Government, and providing information and recommendations on security and resilience
measures to federal and non-federal entities.
Q: What does NCCIC do?

AGILITY

NCCIC helps people and organizations defend their cyber
and communications networks, and responds to nationally
significant incidents when they occur.
We enhance the security of the cyber and STRENGTH
communications
ecosystem through threat information sharing across the globe.
If reliable information flows quickly and to enough people, we
can halt cyber incidents before they spread widely and cause
significant harm. On our 24/7 watch floor, we continuously
monitor national and international incidents and events that
may affect cyber and communications infrastructure. By fusing
information from all levels of government, the private sector,
international partners, and the public, we help people and
organizations take action to protect against cybersecurity risks.
This coordination also improves government-wide incident and
emergency response capabilities and strengthens resilience.
NCCIC’s priority is delivering products and services to protect
the networks and systems that underpin our Nation’s critical
infrastructure (CI). CI includes essential government services,
financial institutions, energy providers, transportation systems,
water treatment systems, public health, chemical and nuclear
plants, and emergency services (table 1 shows the 16
identified CI sectors). At the same time, we make many of
NCCIC’s products and services available at no cost to all
Americans to use to protect themselves from cyber threats.

Working with our partners, we used our telecommunications
capabilities to respond to major hurricanes, wildfires, and
other natural disasters. We streamlined our cyber assessment
and analytic teams to better enable network defenders to
identify—and reduce the risk of—malicious attacks. We built
out our vulnerability management capabilities to ensure
responsible disclosure of IT and OT vulnerabilities and to provide
corresponding research and analysis. We continued to develop
and expand our capacity to respond to incidents, and we stood
up a new cyber hunt capability that significantly improves our
ability to proactively find threat actors on government and
CI networks.

Q: How is NCCIC evolving?
Our evolution is an ongoing process. We continuously look for
ways to create a more nimble organization that can quickly
adapt to the changing threat environment and deliver critical
products and services to our stakeholders with greater speed,

To succeed in an ever-changing cyber and communications
environment, we recognize that we must do an extraordinary
job. We must always strive to be more effective in everything we
do. We will continue to listen to our partners and stakeholders,
learn from the evolving landscape, and adapt our operations
and tools to be a step ahead of cyber threat actors.

Q: How does NCCIC protect the public and private sectors
from cybersecurity and communications threats?
Integration is one of our core functions. Many of our
partners—including members of the intelligence community,
law enforcement, and major Internet service providers—are
co-located on our watch floor, which facilitates coordination and
collaboration. We exchange information with these partners,
analyze data, and provide results in publicly available alerts,
technical advisories, and reports.
We also help stakeholders improve cyber hygiene, assess
cybersecurity posture, test network defenses, and enhance
preparedness and expertise through exercises and training.
Additionally, when major incidents occur, the NCCIC team
provides both remote and on-site incident response support
to federal departments and agencies; state, local, tribal, and
territorial (SLTT) governments; and the private sector.

Q: What did NCCIC accomplish in Fiscal Year 2017?
As you will read throughout this report, NCCIC continued
to operate at a high tempo in Fiscal Year 2017 (FY17). We
responded to diverse incidents, conducted exercises to support
operational readiness, and provided guidance on advanced
persistent threat (APT) campaigns, including GRIZZLY STEPPE,
Dragonfly, and HIDDEN COBRA.2 In FY17, NCCIC also responded
to malware implants on critical systems, including IT service
providers, where an attacker could exploit credential
compromises to gain access to customer network environments.

OUR

ORGANIZATION

As part of our commitment to serve customers better, over the last year
NCCIC conducted an extensive internal review of operations. Based in
part on the review, we created significant functional enhancements
that position NCCIC as a more efficient and responsive organization.
Specifically, these changes
• improve our overall analytic capacity and realign resources toward
greater effectiveness;
• expand our incident response and tailored hunt services;
• integrate our information technology and operational technology (IT
and OT) assessment and vulnerability coordination capabilities; and
• consolidate our national exercise and training programs.
The realignment integrates the United States Computer Emergency
Readiness Team (US-CERT) and Industrial Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) into a single, functionally organized
NCCIC structure that combines intersecting functions from those legacy
organizations. The work US-CERT and ICS-CERT performed as organizations
under the NCCIC umbrella was extraordinary, and NCCIC retains all of the
expertise, functions, and capabilities that those organizations provided.
The dedicated professionals with whom our stakeholders have developed
trusted working relationships will continue their specialized work within
the NCCIC, ready to draw on the broader resources of the entire NCCIC to
serve customers better.
Moving forward, our focus is on innovation, value, execution, and
operational excellence. We will consistently look for ways to better serve
stakeholders as together we build a more sustainable, secure, and
resilient cyber and communications environment.

OUR

VISION

OUR

MISSION

NCCIC’s vision is a secure and robust cyber and
communications infrastructure, resilient against
attacks and disruption. In pursuing our vision, we
adhere to a number of Guiding Principles:

NCCIC’s mission is to reduce the risk of systemic
cybersecurity and communications challenges in our
role as the Nation’s flagship cyber defense, incident
response, and operational integration center.

• Put Customers First. Understand and meet our
customer and constituent needs quickly and
completely.

We execute this mission by serving as a national hub
for cyber and communications information, technical
expertise, and operational integration, and by
operating our 24/7 situational awareness, analysis,
and incident response center.

• Lead the Global Mission. In service to our
national interests, serve as a global
ambassador for cyber and communications
security expertise, excellence, and information.
• Be an Active Force for Good. Defend the
homeland by being the first and best option
to identify, understand, prevent, protect, and
respond to significant threats and exploitations
of our cyber and communications infrastructure.
• Drive Innovation. Stay on the cutting edge of
innovation to bring down risk, learning from past
experiences and anticipating change. Inspire
others to better understand and apply cyber and
communications knowledge and tools.

To execute its mission, NCCIC performs a number of
core functions:
• information exchange,
• training and exercises,
• risk and vulnerability assessments,
• data synthesis and analysis,
• operational planning and coordination,
• watch operations, and
• incident response and recovery.

• Be Right, Be Fast. Connect people-to-people
and people-to-content to build community
knowledge. Share threat and vulnerability
information quickly and broadly, while
maintaining the confidence and trust of our
stakeholders, and the constitutional rights of
the American people.
• Earn Trust. Relentlessly build our reputation as
the authoritative source of information and a

LEADING A
GLOBAL FIGHT,
COORDINATING A
UNIFIED NATIONAL
EFFORT
NCCIC’s mission can only succeed with the help and active participation of
our stakeholders. We are committed to dialogue and engagement at all levels,
whether it is operational coordination on the NCCIC watch floor, analyst-to-analyst
exchanges, participation in industry events and global forums, or leading nationallevel cyber exercises. Trust within the community of cyber and communications
stakeholders is essential to this collective defense strategy. NCCIC builds trust by:
•

embedding confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties protections into our
information sharing culture;

•

demonstrating our technical competence; and

•

listening and responding to stakeholder needs.

NCCIC’s primary stakeholders—customers, constituents, and partners—include the
Federal Government; SLTT governments; private sector businesses (particularly
those that manage critical infrastructure); the research and academic community;
the public; and our international allies. Going forward, we will focus on new ways of
adding value to our partnerships, and expanding the community of contributors to
the global cyber and communications security mission.

11

FEDERAL
DEPARTMENTS
AND AGENCIES
Federal network defense is a coordinated
effort, and NCCIC collaborates closely
with its constituent departments and
agencies to help them take action to
mitigate cyber risk.
Federal departments and agencies are
also major contributors to our cyber and
communications security capabilities.
NCCIC coordinates with various federal
organizations—particularly SectorSpecific Agencies, the Office of
Management and Budget, other DHS
organizations, and the intelligence and
law enforcement communities—on a
broad range of operational activities. For
example, we maintain close operational
relationships with other federal cybersecurity centers and federal security
operations centers (SOCs). These include
the following:
• Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration
Center (Office of the Director of
National Intelligence)
• U.S. Cyber Command Joint
Operations Center (Department
of Defense);
• Department of Defense Cyber Crime
Center (DC3);
• National Cyber Investigative
Joint Task Force (Federal Bureau
of Investigation);
• Intelligence Community-Security
Coordination Center;
• National Security Agency (NSA)
Central Security Service Threat
Operations Center; and
• various federal SOCs (e.g.,
Transportation Security
Administration SOC).
During major incidents, or in response to
sustained cyber campaigns and challenges,
NCCIC spearheads DHS coordination and

4

collaboration with departments and
agencies.4 We provide situational awareness and advice to DHS leadership and
senior government officials, Congress,
and the National Security Council.
NCCIC also plays a key role in the
Continuity Communications Manager’s
Group (CCMG) forum. Meeting every
quarter, CCMG provides a critical forum
for information sharing and coordination
among continuity communications
managers to address issues, challenges,
opportunities, new technologies, and
solutions. CCMG also addresses matters
related to policy, planning, operations,
testing, evaluation, and systems
interoperability affecting the executive
branch continuity communications
environment. It is also an important
forum to review and address continuity
communications test results, trends,
compliance assessment reports, and
long-term communications challenges.

PRIVATE
SECTOR
The private sector owns and operates
the majority of the Nation’s critical
infrastructure (CI), including “lifeline”
sectors—Communications, Emergency
Services, Energy, Transportation Systems,
and Water and Wastewater Systems.
Private sector organizations are essential

partners. NCCIC needs private sector
information, innovation, technical expertise, and active engagement to successfully carry out our mission. Additionally,
our adversaries frequently target private
sector CI organizations due to the degree
to which society relies on the goods and
services they provide. Because of this,
private sector CI owners and operators are
major consumers of NCCIC products, as
well as essential partners.
NCCIC continues to integrate the private
sector to better facilitate information
flow during both normal and incident
conditions. For example, we regularly
work with CI partners on joint incident
management actions and analysis to
share with the broader CI community.
The private sector organizations NCCIC
engages include
• businesses of all sizes;
• vendors;
• researchers;
• universities;
• think tanks;
• industry associations;
• presidential advisory bodies;
• CI coordinating organizations; and
• individual CI owners and operators
from across private industry.

ICSJWG: Uniting to Enhance ICS Security
In 2009, DHS established the Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) to
improve coordination and information exchange between government and the control systems
community. ICSJWG is an essential platform for dialogue and collaborative action between
NCCIC’s industrial control systems (ICS) specialists and the ICS community.
Fostering the exchange of technical expertise and security awareness information between
government and the ICS community, ICSJWG is one of NCCIC’s most important and enduring
partnerships. Members include ICS vendors and integrators, CI owners and operators,
researchers, international partners, and federal departments and agencies.

As part of our robust cyber collaboration with the private sector,
we maintain close coordination with the telecommunications
industry. In particular, NCCIC’s National Coordinating Center
for Communications (NCC) manages the Communications
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Comms-ISAC) to share
and apply the technical expertise, threat awareness, and operational
capabilities required to address hazards and risks to the Nation’s
telecommunications infrastructure. We maintain integrated
operational relationships—physically and virtually—with
communications service providers and other stakeholders to get
real-time operating status and to coordinate assistance during
an incident.

STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL, AND
TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS
State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, (SLTT) and regional
organizations and officials are critical to the Nation’s cyber and
communications security. These include state Homeland Security
Advisors, Chief Information Officers, Chief Information Security
Officers (CISOs), intelligence fusion centers, law enforcement,
community leaders, and emergency responders.
NCCIC coordinates closely with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and SLTT governments to support
the restoration of communications infrastructure during major
emergencies. NCCIC also works with SLTT partners to address
communications threats facing public safety answering points
(e.g., telephony denial-of-service attacks).

Supporting Our Election Infrastructure
NCCIC was a critical contributor to a DHS initiative to ensure the
integrity of the Nation’s EI in preparation for the November 2016
general election. The purpose of the initiative was to raise
awareness of cybersecurity vulnerabilities within voting infrastructure
and increase the security and resilience of the electoral process.
Voting-related processes potentially at risk include electronic voting,
Internet voting, and voter registration systems. NCCIC provided state
and local governments—upon request—with free and continuous
cyber hygiene scanning services, as well as in-depth vulnerability
assessments of computer-enabled election systems. Since Fall
2016, more than 60 state and local jurisdictions have engaged
NCCIC and signed up for continuous scanning and vulnerability
assessment services.
In January 2017, DHS announced that election infrastructure would
be a priority for cybersecurity assistance and protections on a formal
and enduring basis. The designation of EI as a subsector of CI means
that customers who request DHS services can now receive prioritized
access to the full scope of NCCIC cybersecurity services.
Since September 2017, NCCIC has participated in the newly formed
DHS Election Task Force. The task force supports information sharing
on cyber threats with state election officials to help ensure the
security and integrity of EI. In FY17, NCCIC worked with seven states
and four local jurisdictions to conduct in-depth risk and vulnerability
assessments to ensure the security and resilience of election
systems for 2018 state and local elections. NCCIC will prioritize
requests from SLTT partners—expected to increase as the 2018
elections approach—to ensure preparation for upcoming elections.

Delivering End-to-End Services:
City of Los Angeles Cybersecurity Engagements

The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center5 (MSISAC) is a critical state and local resource. Funded in part by DHS,
MS-ISAC is an essential mechanism for coordination between
NCCIC and SLTT customers. With dedicated liaison staff on the
NCCIC watch floor, MS-ISAC is a focal point for state-level cyber
threat prevention, protection, response, and recovery. As NCCIC
receives information, MS-ISAC can quickly share that information
with its members.

NCCIC’s work with the government of the City of Los Angeles is an
excellent example of the end-to-end services we provide to help
organizations reduce risk.

In late FY17, DHS added the Election Infrastructure (EI) Subsector
to the Government Facilities Sector. NCCIC is an active participant
and key member of the cybersecurity task force that supports the
EI Subsector, helping to ensure the integrity and reliability of our
critical election systems.

NCCIC also facilitated a cyber tabletop exercise at the U.S.
Secret Service Los Angeles field office. The exercise tested
citywide cybersecurity governance, with a focus on information
exchange and cyber incident response plans and processes. The
eight-hour exercise involved approximately 80 federal, state, and
city participants and examined the City’s ability to respond to a
significant cyber incident affecting several of its departments.

For example, NCCIC enrolled the City in the AIS initiative
to enable automated sharing of cyber threat indicators of
compromise (IOCs). We performed cyber hygiene vulnerability
scans of key public-facing information systems and conducted
cyber resilience reviews.

The exercise clarified the primary and supporting roles and
responsibilities of Federal, state, and local response entities.

Each year, ICSJWG holds spring and fall meetings. In FY17, 638 people attended the meetings,
which included vendor expos, a two-day “hands-on” ICS workshop, and technical presentations
on topics as diverse as ransomware, supply chain security, and meeting the demand for
cybersecurity professionals.

Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-41, United States Cyber Incident Coordination, outlines the roles federal agencies play during a significant cyber incident. DHS plays a major role in both
asset response and threat response. DHS is the lead agency for asset response during a significant cyber incident, focusing on the assets of the victim or potential targets of malicious
activity. In fulfilling this responsibility, NCCIC assists asset owners in mitigating vulnerabilities, identifies other entities that may be at risk, and shares information across the public and
private sectors to protect against similar incidents in the future. The Department of Justice, through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, is the lead agency for
threat response during a significant incident, with DHS’s investigative agencies playing a crucial role in criminal investigations.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
INFORMATION SHARING

5

Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) seek to expand information sharing by encouraging the formation of communities that share information across a region or in
response to a specific emerging cyber threat. Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are essential drivers of effective cybersecurity collaboration for specific industrial sectors
such as banking and financial services, energy, telecommunications and defense. ISACs are trusted entities established by CI owners and operators to provide comprehensive sector
analysis, which they share across sectors and with government.

14

INTERNATIONAL
PARTNERS
Cyber threats are borderless and ubiquitous. Attacks in distant parts of
the world may replicate quickly and cause cascading consequences for
our own cyber and communications infrastructure.
NCCIC is a leader in the global fight for secure cyber and communications
networks, and brings together a broad range of international partners
in a common effort to strengthen our capacity to fight threats. Through
this work, we improve the cyber and communications risk posture of the
United States.
Strengthening operational collaboration with international counterparts
enables us to prepare for, prevent, mitigate, and respond to incidents
that could degrade or overwhelm cyber and communications assets.
Operational relationships among nations play a significant role in
ensuring the safety and resilience of cyberspace. We know that our ability
to respond to and overcome global cyber challenges improves in part by
the degree to which we can act in close coordination and cooperation.
In close coordination with the State Department, NCCIC collaborates with
international partners to build situational awareness, reduce risk, and
coordinate information sharing and international response to incidents.
We coordinate with our global peers in a number of areas, including
• exchange of technical expertise,
• threat intelligence sharing,

Fighting WannaCry Ransomware:
A Sustained Global Effort
The May 2017 global WannaCry ransomware campaign
highlights continued attempts by malicious actors to
leverage cyberspace to disrupt international CI and cause
economic loss. It is also an excellent example of how,
together with our global partners, NCCIC can help fight
such attacks and minimize their impact.

WannaCry exploited a critical Windows Server Message
Block vulnerability to remotely compromise victim
systems, encrypt files, and spread to other hosts. Attackers
demanded money to unencrypt the affected files.

NCCIC published Technical Alert TA17-132A, “Indicators
Associated with WannaCry Ransomware.”
May 13, 2017

NCCIC coordinated with more than 40 IT and cybersecurity
companies (including major Internet service providers) to
convey what we knew.
As part of its mission to protect federal departments and
agencies, NCCIC also led Cybersecurity Coordination,
Assessment, and Response (C-CAR) meetings to share
actionable information about the threats. C-CARs are a
critical complement to NCCIC’s technical alerts and follow
a standard protocol. This protocol enables DHS to convey
information to CISOs and request action from federal
departments and agencies to gain awareness of potentially
affected systems across the Federal Government.

NCCIC implemented Enhanced Coordination Procedures
with cyber center partners to increase coordination and
synchronization.
NCCIC held coordination calls with over 40 IT and
cybersecurity companies and all major ISPs to share known
information and connect NCCIC operational teams with
partners for analysis and information sharing.

“

[Our IT and security company partners]
stayed on the line with us, on these chat
rooms and helped us pick [WannaCry]
apart. And I really believe that that’s the
model for the future and it really just
highlights all of the work that’s gone
on for years and years and years…
just tremendous partnership and a
[recognition] that we’re all sort of in
this together and we have to have that
willingness [to work together].

WannaCry began in Asia on May 12, 2017, and rapidly
spread across the world—sources reported hundreds of
thousands of infections in over 150 countries in just days.
Due in part to the coordinated and sustained counteraction
by NCCIC and its domestic and foreign partners, WannaCry
had limited impact on U.S. CI.

• quickly sharing information that identified the
vulnerability WannaCry exploited;

• cyber and communications capacity building.

The following timeline highlights key events

WHAT WE DO
Each day, NCCIC personnel work tirelessly to help our
stakeholders secure their cyber and communications
systems. Yet it is only with the enthusiastic participation
of the entire cyber community that we will succeed in our
mission. Our partners are essential to everything we do.

17

18

NCCIC is a hub for information and expertise.
We are a global exchange for cyber and communications
information, sharing what we receive back to the community.

We build risk awareness and help people understand
how to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities.

We defend federal networks and
respond to significant incidents.

We help customers take action to improve their risk posture
and support a common operational picture of the national
cyber and communications risk landscape.

Perhaps most importantly, we are here for our
partners and customers when they need help. We
vigilantly defend the Federal Government’s critical
networks and stand ready to respond to attacks
on both government and private sector networks.

A GLOBAL FOCAL POINT FOR
INFORMATION AND EXPERTISE
NCCIC uses information from across the globe to defend federal
networks, to help the private sector defend its own networks, and to
build community knowledge and current-state awareness of the cyber
and communications risk landscape. NCCIC receives classified and
unclassified information through trusted, operational relationships with

COMMS-ISAC: NCCIC’s Partner in Information Sharing
Grew Industrial Control Systems Joint Working
Group to 2,680 members, expanding the
collaborative community of industrial control
systems (ICS) partners

Helped more than 2,100 customers use the
Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET) to conduct
self-evaluations of their ICS security posture

Shared roughly 1.3 million IOCs since
the inception of AIS in March 2016

Conducted more than 160 on-site enterprise and

hygiene scans

A core contributor to this information sharing mission is the Communications
ISAC (Comms-ISAC), managed by NCCIC’s National Coordinating Center
for Communications (NCC). The Comms-ISAC comprises communications
service providers (CSPs)—including wireline, cellular, cable, satellite, and
broadcast—equipment manufacturers, vendors, associations, and other
industry partners. The Comms-ISAC facilitates the exchange of analyzed
vulnerability, threat, intrusion, and anomaly information across the
telecommunications community to help prevent, mitigate, respond to, and
recover from communications threats and disruptions.

When our partners—both domestic and international—share
information with us, we can share it with our stakeholders to enhance
situational awareness and defense efforts across the globe. We regularly
share alerts and warnings with international partners—through
multilateral fora and bilateral relationships—so that they can better
protect their infrastructure. NCCIC relies on the information received
from these partners to inform our own cyber and communications
security and resilience efforts.

20

THE WATCH FLOOR:
NCCIC’S INFORMATION SHARING HUB
Each day, NCCIC’s 24/7 watch floor receives, triages, tracks,
coordinates, and manages high volumes of threat, vulnerability,
and incident information. The watch floor disseminates this
information to NCCIC analysts for resolution and—as quickly as
possible—shares alerts, reports, and other information products
back to the community, so that our customers and partners can
take action.
A diverse set of information sources is vital to developing a
big-picture perspective of the Nation’s systemic cyber and
communications risk. In turn, this overarching view helps us
“connect the dots,” so that we can quickly identify and help our
customers mitigate threats and respond to incidents.
Operating in two physical locations—Arlington, VA, and
Pensacola, FL—the watch floor provides shared national-level
situational awareness and a forum for real-time operational
collaboration with NCCIC’s many partners. Our Arlington
operations are co-located with the National Infrastructure
Coordinating Center (NICC)6 to ensure coordinated and
consistent information exchange with our customers for both
physical and cyber threats.

6

EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION
SHARING CAPABILITIES
In addition to the watch floor, we share information through
numerous additional methods, including automated machineto-machine sharing in near real-time, cooperative agreements
with private industry, vulnerability disclosure programs, and
timely alerts and warnings.
Over the last year and a half, NCCIC expanded its information
sharing capabilities in two important ways: we launched the
Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative, and incorporated
the Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Collaboration
Program (CISCP) into NCCIC operations.
AIS automates the sharing of IOCs, creating an ecosystem where
as soon as businesses or federal departments and agencies
observe attempted compromises, they can share the IOCs in near
real-time with the entire AIS community. AIS focuses on volume
and velocity—not human validation of each IOC—and provides
NCCIC partners with real-time data that enables them to take
action against threats.
Similarly, CISCP enables private sector CI partners and NCCIC to
exchange cyber threat, incident, and vulnerability information
to support network defense. Through CISCP, participants receive
NCCIC’s in-depth analytical products that correlate detection and

defensive measures, as well as recommended practices focused
on threat detection, prevention, and mitigation. CISCP also hosts
analyst-to-analyst technical threat exchanges and analyst training
events that include detailed threat briefings.

Data Security: How We Safeguard Your Information
As a global information sharing hub, NCCIC bears a significant
responsibility to protect the information we receive and to ensure
we safeguard privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We take this
responsibility extremely seriously and we do everything in our power
to earn our stakeholders’ trust by maintaining the confidentiality of
sensitive information.

NCCIC also uses the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) to safeguard information.
TLP is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is
only shared with the appropriate audience. TLP is a simple, yet effective,
schema that employs four colors to indicate when and how sensitive
information can be shared, facilitating more frequent and effective
collaboration.

The Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) program is one
significant way NCCIC ensures that critical infrastructure information
stakeholders share remains protected from

In all instances, NCCIC prioritizes the security and privacy of information
when sharing with its partners. For example, we limit IOC information
to that necessary to characterize the threat. Another example of DHS’s
commitment to data protection is the Continuous Diagnostics and
Mitigation (CDM) program. Through CDM, government entities can
purchase cybersecurity services. CDM data feeds provide governmentwide network visibility to NCCIC through a common dashboard. However,
CDM’s design also rigorously ensures data does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information—information about specific user
accounts.

» the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
» SLTT disclosure laws,
» use in regulatory actions, and
» use in civil litigation.
Only trained and certified federal, state, and local government employees
or contractors may access PCII and only in accordance with strict
safeguarding and handling requirements.

NICC is the dedicated 24/7 coordination and information sharing operations center that maintains situational awareness of the Nation’s critical infrastructure for the Federal Government.

BUILDING UNDERSTANDING
AND AWARENESS
OF SYSTEMIC RISK
As attacks on our cyber and communications infrastructure
grow in diversity, prevalence, and sophistication, NCCIC’s
mission demands that we stay ahead of the threat curve. One of
the ways we do this is by synthesizing our data with data from
open-source research, private sector partners, the intelligence
community, international partners, and federal network feeds.
The greater the volume of high-quality data NCCIC receives
and analyzes, the better our understanding of threats and
vulnerabilities.
Using this data, along with state-of-the-art tools and techniques,
our analysts work to determine the nature of threats to systems,
including enterprise business networks, control systems, and
telecommunications infrastructure. They apply this knowledge
to analytical offerings, which include technical alerts, guidance,
best practices, and direct operational communication with other
analysts in government and the private sector. These products
integrate threat information, help provide an overall picture of
the risk landscape, and support incident response.
21

Suspected Malware?
Our Data Analysis Team Can Help

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES
Our technical analysis directly supports our mission to reduce
risk to the Nation’s CI. NCCIC technical analysts provide
malware analysis, digital analysis, reverse engineering, and trend
analysis. Their expertise and findings inform our exploration of
systemic vulnerabilities; potential future threats; tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and more intractable
long-term problems.
Our analysis and vulnerability coordination services reside
primarily in our advanced malware analysis laboratories. We are
increasing our focus on identifying trends and systemic risks
associated with rapidly evolving areas such as the Internet of
Things, including networked medical devices and avionics, cloud
technologies, and the continued convergence of traditional
telecommunications infrastructure with cyber-based technologies.

While not every detected malware instance is as damaging or far-reaching as WannaCry,
all are worthy of NCCIC’s attention and support. NCCIC’s malware laboratories have a
streamlined process to help network owners understand the risks associated with suspected
malware activity. Network owners can submit files directly to NCCIC’s malware analysis team
for action through a secure web portal, email, or file transfer protocol.
Once received, NCCIC analysts review the files for IOCs to determine the type of malware
potentially present. We provide the network owner with a report detailing the type of malware
detected, an analysis of the IOCs present, and a list of appropriate mitigation strategies.
NCCIC develops reports in several formats and specifications, including Structured Threat
Information eXpression (STIX)—a standard language used to automate the exchange of cyber
threat information.
A combination of open-source, commercial, and custom-developed tools power the malware
analysis process. NCCIC analysts use automated toolsets to analyze malware, but also have
the capability to reverse engineer malware files to gather information and develop associated
IOCs. Analysts convert IOC information into anonymized, shareable reports to inform the
larger cyber community. By sharing information of suspected malware with NCCIC, network
operators can better secure their own network while reducing systemic risk across the entire
cyber landscape.

22

SUPPORTING RISK-BASED CYBERSECURITY:
ASSESSMENTS AND CYBER HUNT
Our assessment and cyber hunt capabilities enable our customers
to take a proactive, risk-based approach to cybersecurity, and to
target specific improvements to their cyber risk posture.
NCCIC risk and vulnerability assessment services focus on
analyzing customer networks to identify and help remediate
weaknesses. They include highly automated cyber hygiene scans
that help customers secure their network perimeter by assessing
their Internet-accessible systems for known vulnerabilities and
configuration errors. We conduct vulnerability scans, phishing
campaign assessments, risk and vulnerability assessments, federal
High Value Asset assessments, remote penetration testing, federal
Red Team assessments, and operational assurance reviews.
FY17 also marked some innovative enhancements to our
information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT)
assessment capabilities. We integrated our end-to-end assessment
service offerings for enterprise and ICS environments, providing
a seamless assessment capability to customers. Most significantly,
23

we increased the number of assessment teams we can field,
thereby expanding our capacity to serve both federal and
private sector CI customers. We also added a new remote log
analysis capability to our ICS assessment services. Our process
now provides the NCCIC team with a better understanding
of customer systems, and helps the customer identify and
pull relevant log data in advance of the on-site assessment. In
addition to facilitated assessments, we continue to offer the
Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET)—a downloadable tool that
enables CI owners and operators to conduct a self-assessment of
their control systems networks.
NCCIC’s cyber hunt services, which we continue to expand, also
provide customers greater visibility into the security posture of
their networks. NCCIC conducts hunt missions at the invitation
of government and private sector customers, including CI owners
and operators. Hunt missions proactively search for malicious
activity to help customers identify potential exploitation.
NCCIC’s cyber hunt focuses on deep technical analysis of a live
network with the intent of identifying previously unobserved
threats.

Trending System Vulnerabilities
Lapses in basic cybersecurity practices continue to
be the most prevalent type of vulnerability our teams
discover when assessing enterprise systems. As was
the case in FY16, in FY17 our assessment teams
found the most frequently identified enterprise system
vulnerabilities to be

For Internet-facing systems, over half of the vulnerabilities we detected dealt with use
of weak cipher suites within the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security protocol.
In FY17, our ICS assessment teams found the most frequently identified control system
vulnerabilities to be

» susceptibility to email phishing,

» boundary protection—this was the single most prevalent area of concern,
continuing a four-year trend,

» poor password practices,

» identification and authentication of legitimate system users, and

» poor patch management, and

» allocation of resources.

» improper configuration.
Within those categories, we have seen an increase
in use of insecure default configurations and
unsupported operating systems. On a positive note,
we have also seen an overall decrease in reuse of
administrator passwords as well as passwords stored
in clear text.

Boundary protection is a critical element of defense-in-depth strategies—effective
ICS defense requires a network architecture that isolates sensitive control systems
from enterprise networks, which are inherently more risky. With respect to allocation of
resources, NCCIC repeatedly found that ICS operators struggled with staff limitations
when working to execute critical cybersecurity tasks.

24

Assessment-to-Incident Response:
Providing Fully Integrated
Cybersecurity Services
In 2017, NCCIC performed 139 on-site ICS assessments to determine how well customers’
cyber defenses could prevent malicious attacks. NCCIC assessments focus on identifying
security gaps with the greatest potential for exploitation and harm, and on identifying and
recommending solutions with the greatest benefit.
The teamwork and close collaboration between our assessment and response units is a good
example of NCCIC’s approach to customer service—we focus on providing customers with a
fully integrated cybersecurity service portfolio to meet all their needs. When NCCIC responds
to an incident, our response team often recommends that the affected organization undergo a
full network assessment (after the response team resolves the immediate issue) to maximize
overall network health and hygiene, and reduce the likelihood and severity of future incidents.

to cyber and communications incidents.
NCCIC offers a variety of scalable exercise
formats—from facilitated, targeted
attack tabletop discussions to full-scale,
national-level functional exercises. Our
services include the design, development,
planning, evaluation, and conduct of
cybersecurity exercises. These critical
exercises enable us to provide insight
into how our partners detect and respond
to a variety of attacks and how they can
further strengthen their defenses.

On federal networks, NCCIC cyber hunt teams search for malicious actors inside highvalue assets (HVAs), and tailor assessments specifically to systems that connect to—or
interact with—HVAs. These teams work closely with NCCIC HVA penetration testers.

An important focus for our technical
training is the planned expansion of
our ICS training capabilities. Current
training offerings include web-based
and instructor-led technical training. As
part of our advanced training course,
NCCIC offers an advanced Red Team-Blue
Team exercise within a simulated ICS
training environment. In March 2017,
NCCIC celebrated its 100th training class
for Red-Blue Team training (formally
known as the Industrial Control Systems
Cybersecurity (301) Advanced Training).
The training offers a hands-on approach
to understanding a network environment,
identifying potential vulnerabilities,
evaluating exploitation of vulnerabilities,
and applying defensive and mitigation
strategies to protect industrial control
systems. To date, more than 4,500
trainees have completed the training.

NCCIC cyber hunt team services include

In 2017, NCCIC’s Training team:

• examination of existing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and processes;

• conducted 12 ICS Red-Blue Team
courses;

A recent routine assessment and analysis for a control systems customer in the
Transportation Sector exemplifies the benefits of NCCIC’s integrated customer service
approach. During the assessment process, our assessors noted excessive Internet Control
Message Protocol traffic originating from a control systems host that was communicating
out to various Internet Protocol (IP) addresses around the world. This indicated potentially
malicious activity, so NCCIC assessors immediately recommended involvement from NCCIC’s
incident response team.
At the asset owner’s request, NCCIC switched its focus from an assessment to an incident
investigation, and quickly discovered that the suspicious traffic was likely due to automated
scanning of external IPs by the ICS host. Forensics analysis revealed the ICS host had been
subjected to brute-force hacking attempts against its remote desktop service. The analysis
also revealed that the remote desktop service was directly accessible from the Internet and
not protected by a firewall or virtual private network. NCCIC provided mitigation guidance
to the organization, which included establishing firewall protection to prevent unauthorized
access from the Internet.

• system owner interviews;
• host-based analysis;
• review of existing logs;
• network traffic analysis; and
• data mappings and other diagrams.
NCCIC hunt teams use data drawn from the broad array of NCCIC sources—including
the intelligence and law enforcement communities—to identify malicious tools and
adversary TTPs extant on customer networks.

BUILDING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND PREPAREDNESS:
TRAINING AND EXERCISES
In FY17, NCCIC consolidated and integrated its technical training and exercise products
and services to enhance the way we deliver these capabilities to our customers.
Our robust cyber exercise program enables government and private sector partners to
plan and test their preparedness, policies, processes, and procedures when responding

25

• led four regional sessions with
introductory and intermediate
content (three of which were for
international partners);
• trained more than 1,200 students in
instructor-led classes;
• conducted 17 tours of NCCIC’s
control systems analysis center in
Idaho Falls, Idaho; and
• saw roughly 20,000 trainees
complete one or more online classes.

Cyber Guard and Cyber Storm:
Preparing for National-Level Cyber Incidents
In FY17, NCCIC led DHS planning and coordination for Cyber Guard,
an annual two-week exercise headed by Department of Defense
(DOD) U.S. Cyber Command and co-sponsored by DHS and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Cyber Guard 2017 included experts from over 100 organizations,
including the Federal Government, state governments, industry,
academia, and international allies. Participants practiced tactical
cyber incident response processes and operational coordination.
NCCIC personnel participated at the main exercise location in
Suffolk, VA, and from NCCIC’s Pensacola, FL, location. Cyber Guard
2017 enabled NCCIC to hone incident response processes while also
enhancing working relationships with partners who are pivotal to our
ability to respond effectively to national-level cyber incidents.
In FY18, NCCIC will lead all aspects of Cyber Storm, a national-level
exercise occurring every two years. Planning for Cyber Storm VI,
slated to occur in Spring 2018, is already well underway.
Cyber Storm VI exercise will focus on the Critical Manufacturing
and Transportation Sectors with participation from the Information
Technology and Communications Sectors; law enforcement, defense,
and intelligence agencies; state and local governments; and
international partners.
We conducted Cyber Storm V in March 2016. The exercise focused
on testing preparedness and response to a multi-sector cyber
attack targeting the Healthcare and Public Health and Commercial
Facilities Sectors. The exercise included more than 100 organizations
and 1,200 players from across the globe. More than 96 percent of
respondents to an after-action questionnaire indicated that
participation in Cyber Storm V helped them become better prepared
to deal successfully with a cyber incident.

Building Global Expertise and Capacity
Cybersecurity is a global concern, and as our allies’ cybersecurity
capabilities grow, so does U.S. security. NCCIC works extensively
with international partners to help them build cybersecurity
technical expertise and understanding.
In July 2017, instructors from NCCIC’s Training team traveled to
Vilnius, Lithuania, to conduct an international training session on
cybersecurity for industrial control systems (ICS) at the University of
Lithuania’s Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
The Lithuanian Ministry of Defense hosted the training in
cooperation with U.S. European Command. More than 100
information technology specialists—working in various CI sectors
in Lithuania and other NATO countries—attended the training.
Represented countries included the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, the
Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and the United States.
At the invitation of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry (METI) and the Information-Technology Promotion Agency,
in September 2017, NCCIC also traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to
participate in an ICS cybersecurity joint training.
This event, held at the Industrial Cybersecurity Center of Excellence
in Tokyo, aimed to help combat Japan’s shortfall of cybersecurity
manpower. Representatives of METI stated that the training was
very beneficial to students, not only enhancing their skills and
knowledge relative to ICS, but also helping them learn of the
advantages of global collaboration in cybersecurity.

DEFENDING FEDERAL
NETWORKS AND
RESPONDING TO
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS
One of our core mission areas is leading efforts to protect
federal civilian government networks. Threat actors
consider federal departments and agencies high-value
targets, given the critical services they provide and the
sensitive data they store. NCCIC provides federal partners
with critical threat intelligence and network defense
tools to enable them to effectively thwart cyber attacks.
Additionally, NCCIC assists these partners with incident
management and response.
26

Disaster Response: Restoring Critical Communications

THE EINSTEIN PROGRAM
Through the National Cybersecurity Protection System, NCCIC uses EINSTEIN program
outputs to support cyber defense of the Federal Government. EINSTEIN is a unique
sensor grid that covers all federal department and agency civilian networks. It provides
perimeter protection capabilities to help the Federal Government detect and block
cyber threats. EINSTEIN sensors monitor and capture network data flows to and from
federal systems , providing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. NCCIC also
analyzes sensor data to discover and track adversary TTPs, and to identify new IOCs.
When necessary, NCCIC generates and disseminates alerts to help federal departments
and agencies protect themselves from threats and vulnerabilities. NCCIC continues to
implement tactics that strengthen government and the private sector network defense
capabilities, such as
• increasing the number of IOCs that it shares,
• deploying “reputation scoring” to help organizations prioritize IOCs, and
• piloting advanced analytics to identify cyber threat patterns.

—Presidential Policy Directive 41: United
States Cyber Incident Coordination

RESPONDING TO CYBER AND COMMUNICATIONS INCIDENTS
NCCIC focuses extensive resources on defending government networks and supporting
private sector preparedness and protection.
The persistence, dynamism, and volume of attacks against IT and OT networks,
however, combined with an ever-expanding attack surface as more devices connect to
the Internet, means that some malicious attacks will inevitably succeed. In addition,
2017 was a stark reminder of the devastation that natural disasters can wreak on people,
local and regional economies, and on our cyber and communications infrastructure.
Responding to these events—and supporting our customers’ response—is a
fundamental function that we continually strive to improve.

Hunting for Malicious Activity
In 2017, NCCIC actively tracked, researched, and analyzed the technologies and methods
cyber threat actors used to exploit vulnerabilities, and the behaviors of new or high-impact
malware not attributed to a known adversary. Through these activities, NCCIC identified
previously unrecognized threat actor TTPs. Based on these findings, NCCIC developed analytic
products and reports, providing federal network defenders with the information necessary to
understand adversary TTPs and reduce exposure to malicious activity.

NCCIC is the lead federal organization
responsible for assisting victims in
finding malicious activity on their systems
in the wake of a “significant cyber
incident.”7 This includes leading remote
and on-site responses to cyber attacks on
federal networks. NCCIC also supports
operational awareness and mitigation
actions across the federal domain by
using threat information detected in one
department or agency to protect the rest
of the government and to help the private
sector protect itself.
During incidents and times of crisis, our
operational planning and coordination
team works across government to provide
critical information and overarching
context to inform the decisions of the
White House and other government
organizations. NCCIC works with affected
government and—when requested—
private sector stakeholders to help repair
systems, patch vulnerabilities, reduce the
risk of future incidents, and prevent an
incident from spreading to others. Our
incident response services include expert
intrusion analysis and mitigation guidance
to customers who require external
assistance. While NCCIC prioritizes major
cyber incidents that have the potential
to disrupt or disable our CI, we offer
stakeholders—including federal, SLTT
governments, and private sector
organizations—support for responding
to minor incidents as well.

In 2017, NCCIC led an extensive interagency effort to restore critical communications in
the wake of four large-scale hurricanes that affected the lives of millions and devastated
large areas of Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Through Emergency Support Function (ESF #2) – Communications8, NCCIC’s National
Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC) coordinated federal interagency efforts to
restore communications infrastructure; coordinated communications support to response
efforts; facilitated the delivery of information to emergency management decision makers;
and assisted in the stabilization and reestablishment of communications systems and
applications.
ESF #2 members within DHS—alongside the Federal Communications Commission, the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the General Services
Administration, and the Department of Defense—supported response efforts to affected
areas. Together, this interagency team
• ensured communications were available to impacted communities and responders;
• supported planning, including the development of a public safety recovery plan and
integrated power-communications restoration plans; and
• acted as translators, radio operators, logisticians, and imagery analysts.
The team’s efforts supported the issuance of two communications-related executive orders
in Puerto Rico, which enabled expedited communications restoration and waived taxes for
communications equipment temporarily imported to restore communications. NCCIC also
led the ESF in developing a plan to restore public safety land mobile radio communications
in Puerto Rico. To improve customer connectivity, the interagency team leveraged partnerships in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to increase roaming agreements.
As the national coordinator for ESF #2, NCCIC led efforts with industry partners in each of
the affected states and territories to share resources and information to improve the ability
of the Communications Sector to provide service to affected areas.
In the wake of each disaster, NCCIC and its partners joined in efforts to restore critical
communications by helping to prioritize and resolve issues related to fuel, transportation,
and access. NCCIC also helped forge an agreement—among carriers, tower owners, site
owners, debris removal and road clearance teams, tower climbers, generator technicians,
and fuel suppliers—to expedite site repair through prioritization and collaboration.
NCC also provided extensive analytical support to affected areas. This included
• over 100 telecommunications infrastructure analysis reports before and after
hurricanes;
• coordination of the expedited delivery of 30,000 phone numbers needed to put
replacement phones into service on the U.S. Virgin Islands, shrinking a multi-week
process to days;
• deployment of more than 80 staff to assist affected areas in Florida, Georgia, Puerto
Rico, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and FEMA Headquarters;

Augmenting Incident Response Resources

• daily reports and graphics providing overall telecommunications landline and cellular
networks statistics for the affected areas;

In FY17, NCCIC merged its ICS and enterprise response resources, augmenting our overall
capabilities to meet increased customer demand and more efficiently deploy incident
responders. This integration helps us meet the requirements of

• maps projecting cellular coverage of Puerto Rico at least three times a week, in
coordination with the telecommunications carriers; and
• continuous updates to maps, identifying the availability and location of ancillary
cellular equipment (such as hotspots, cell on wheels, and cell on light trucks).

In FY18, we will continue to expand our ability to provide hunt services and on-site incident
response to customers. We will also continue to mature our remote analysis capabilities,
enabling incident responders to support a larger number of systems with existing resources.

communications infrastructure and to assist SLTT governments with emergency communications and the restoration
of public safety communications systems and first responder networks. ESF #2 supports federal departments and
agencies in procuring and coordinating National Security and Emergency Preparedness communications services.
ESF #2 also addresses cybersecurity issues that result from or occur in conjunction with incidents. However, for
incidents that are primarily cyber in nature, the Cyber Incident Annex is used and ESF #2 supports responses to cyber
incidents as directed.

The Future of NCCIC Information Sharing:
Advancing Automated Indicator Sharing,
Behavioral Analytics, and Orchestration
The launch of the DHS Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)
initiative in March 2016 marked a significant milestone in
the government’s use of automation to support cybersecurity.
NCCIC continues to evolve indicator sharing and is building
on the success of AIS to advance the sharing of actionable
cybersecurity information through automation and
behavioral analytics.
Through AIS, government and private sector participants
exchange cyber threat indicators in near real-time. Threat
indicators—also known as IOCs—are pieces of information,
such as malicious IP addresses or malware hashes that may
signify potential malicious activity. AIS shares as many IOCs as
possible, as quickly as possible. Through rapid, high volume IOC
sharing, AIS minimizes the number of times adversaries can
use the same attack, raising the opportunity costs of the attack, and decreasing the overall cyber attack prevalence. There
are now 184 government and private sector entities—covering
all 16 CI sectors—connected to the AIS server. AIS has received
and shared more than 1.4 million IOCs since its inception.
Mr. Preston Werntz oversees the implementation of AIS. He
works within DHS and with government and private sector
partners to explore how NCCIC can use technology to improve
automated cybersecurity. Werntz sees AIS as an encouraging
step in the right direction, while noting that NCCIC continues
to look for ways to improve the initiative. “AIS is successful
so far, but we recognize that we need to continue to explore
ways to maximize its value,” Werntz said. One way to increase
the value of AIS is to expand coverage and participation.
Strategic partners such as vendors, Information Sharing and
Analysis Centers (ISACs), and Information Sharing and Analysis
Organizations (ISAOs)—with broad customer or membership
bases—can be highly effective force multipliers and significantly
expand AIS participation.
NCCIC is also investigating ways to improve the operational
relevance and quality of the IOCs it shares by adding context
and correlation. This includes both technical context and
intelligence context, such as the IOC’s origination and whether

29

it comes from a sophisticated threat actor. To help provide this
context, NCCIC is focusing on automated capture of IOC “sightings”—the number of times the community sees an IOC—and
on identifying the IOCs that resulted in recipients taking action.
“We want to know when organizations see content and take
action based on that content,” said Werntz. “This information
helps us understand the types of indicators organizations find
useful and whether we are sharing them in a timely manner.”
“Capturing metadata related to which critical infrastructure
sectors are sharing or acting on which indicators, for example,
helps us understand how adversaries are attacking these
sectors or whether there is a targeted campaign against a
specific sector,” Werntz continued. “We also need to improve
the way we use data to feed other programs such as CDM [the
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program] and [the]
EINSTEIN [program].”

MODELING ADVERSARY BEHAVIORS
While AIS is important and, critically, shows how automation
can shape the cybersecurity landscape, NCCIC recognizes that
it must look for new ways to make attacks more difficult, time
consuming, and costly for adversaries to carry out. One such
strategy is the use of analytics that describe malicious behavior
patterns. NCCIC shares those patterns with partners, who then
look for that activity on their networks. Behavioral analytics
describe actions an adversary takes while operating within a
network (e.g., lateral movement, exfiltration, and credential
access). This analysis helps NCCIC understand adversary
tradecraft, discover security gaps, and communicate defense
actions.
“At a basic level, we want to characterize adversary behavior—
tactics, techniques, and procedures—in a standard, machinereadable format,” said Werntz. “We then share this in the form
of an analytic to customers so they can run it in their network
to look for a match. This enables customers to keep data within
their own infrastructure—there is no need to bring data back to
DHS for analysis and correlation. Just tell us if it helped.”

“Customers can look at their current defense coverage against
those behaviors, assess gaps or observed behavior in their
network, and act to take away the behaviors, thus significantly
raising adversary costs,” Werntz added. “In the federal
environment, this also enables departments and agencies to
identify adversary behavior and use CDM to acquire the tools
and services they need to block and disrupt that behavior.”
While many organizations already leverage big data analytics,
NCCIC’s unique position allows it to serve as a collection point
for high-quality data from diverse sources. NCCIC combines
data collected from federal network sensors—and shared
through programs like AIS and CISCP—with data from the intelligence and law enforcement communities. This set of data is
growing and becoming available as departments and agencies
adopt CDM.

INCREASING DECISION SPEED THROUGH
ORCHESTRATION
NCCIC is also working closely with various organizations to
improve interoperability and automated cross-platform functionality within a network’s defense environment. Specifically,
DHS, NSA, and the John’s Hopkins University’s Applied Physics
Laboratory developed the Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense
(IACD) framework, which helps to automate orchestration of
cybersecurity products.
Often, cyber defense tools and products made by different
vendors do not communicate directly with each other, meaning
that cybersecurity analysts must take information from one
product and manually make changes to another. This process is
slow, and not an optimal use of human resources. IACD defines
a framework focused on automating information sharing,
risk decisions, and action. People set the rules and approve
decisions or exceptions, but are otherwise not part of the
operational decision loop. This frees analysts to tackle
anomalies and problems that are more serious. IACD operates
under the principle that effective cyber threat mitigation
requires integration, synchronization, and rapid automation
of capabilities across network defense layers. NCCIC can

Leading Federal Cyber Information Sharing Efforts
The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 states that
NCCIC should operate the Federal Government’s capability
and process for receiving cyber threat indicators and defensive
measures.
Non-federal entities that share such information through NCCIC
are eligible for protections that include liability protection,
protection from release under FOIA, and protection from most
regulatory uses of the information.
AIS is one of the principal mechanisms through which
NCCIC implements this capability and process for the
Federal Government.

apply IACD concepts to the federal environment—working
with agencies on behavioral analytics to identify potential
gaps in coverage or vulnerabilities before exploitation—using
consistent, automated workflows and processes across multiple
agencies.
In late 2017, the Financial Services Information Sharing and
Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) became the latest private sector
organization to embrace IACD concepts and technologies. The
use of automated workflows and orchestrations helped reduce
investigation and response time from 11 hours to 10 minutes,
and enabled an operations team handling 65 events per day
to automatically process up to 95 events simultaneously. IACD
will enable a variety of organizations to quickly share threat
information and prevent and respond to cyber attacks.
Moving forward, the combination of enriched IOCs, behavioral
analytics, and highly automated sharing and orchestration will
be critical elements in NCCIC’s cybersecurity strategy. As both
the threat environment and cybersecurity technologies continue
to evolve, NCCIC remains committed to finding new and better
ways to work with its partners and provide them with solutions
to the Nation’s most intractable cybersecurity challenges.

as a core offering. We are also developing additional
training and exercise offerings for our customers.
Significant planned initiatives include additional
advanced Industrial Control System (ICS) training
courses and the planning and conduct of Cyber Storm
VI, scheduled for Spring 2018.

NCCIC is preparing for additional requirements
stemming from the FY17 establishment of Election
Infrastructure (EI) as a critical infrastructure
subsector of the Government Facilities Sector. In
response, DHS stood up an EI Task Force, of which
NCCIC is a key member. NCCIC will expand the
scale and number of vulnerability scans, cyber hunt
activity, and risk assessments we already conduct
on our EI.

Expanding incident response capacity:

Directive 41 (2016). As part of this effort, we are
building toward the capability to field 12 incident
response teams simultaneously, expanding our
ability to provide analysis and on-site incident
response to customers.

33

Realigning operations
to serve customers better:
NCCIC continues to evolve the way it aligns and
applies organizational resources to meet customer
needs. In FY17, we combined or realigned several
core functions—notably our assessment, analysis,
training, operational coordination, and outreach and
communications functions. These changes allow us
to quickly access a larger resource pool, cross-train
personnel, and streamline management and
administration functions. Importantly, we continue to
build our specialized technical expertise and expand
partnerships to support the security of the Nation’s
IT, OT, and telecommunications systems. We expect
these changes to translate into meaningful
improvements to the way we serve and interact with
our customers, partners, and other stakeholders.

Throughout 2018 and 2019, NCCIC expects to
enhance AIS significantly, adding context and
correlation to enrich indicators of compromise (IOC)
data. We will also augment our technical capabilities
to better leverage behavioral analytics and automated
orchestration, enabling quicker, more effective
information sharing.
