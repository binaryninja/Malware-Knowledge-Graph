Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Targeting U.S. Think
Tanks
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-336a

Summary
This Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics
and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) have observed persistent continued cyber intrusions by advanced
persistent threat (APT) actors targeting U.S. think tanks. This malicious activity is often, but
not exclusively, directed at individuals and organizations that focus on international affairs or
national security policy.[1] The following guidance may assist U.S. think tanks in developing
network defense procedures to prevent or rapidly detect these attacks.
APT actors have relied on multiple avenues for initial access. These have included low-effort
capabilities such as spearphishing emails and third-party message services directed at both
corporate and personal accounts, as well as exploiting vulnerable web-facing devices and
remote connection capabilities. Increased telework during the COVID-19 pandemic has
expanded workforce reliance on remote connectivity, affording malicious actors more
opportunities to exploit those connections and to blend in with increased traffic. Attackers
may leverage virtual private networks (VPNs) and other remote work tools to gain initial
access or persistence on a victim’s network. When successful, these low-effort, high-reward
approaches allow threat actors to steal sensitive information, acquire user credentials, and
gain persistent access to victim networks.
Given the importance that think tanks can have in shaping U.S. policy, CISA and FBI urge
individuals and organizations in the international affairs and national security sectors to
immediately adopt a heightened state of awareness and implement the critical steps listed in
the Mitigations section of this Advisory.

Technical Details
ATT&CK Profile
CISA created the following MITRE ATT&CK profile to provide a non-exhaustive list of tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by APT actors to break through think tanks’
defenses, conduct reconnaissance in their environments, exfiltrate proprietary or confidential
1/9

information, and execute effects on targets. These TTPs were included based upon closed
reporting on APT actors that are known to target think tanks or based upon CISA incident
response data.

Mitigations
CISA and FBI recommend think tank organizations apply the following critical practices to
strengthen their security posture.
Leaders
Implement a training program to familiarize users with identifying social engineering
techniques and phishing emails.
Users/Staff
6/9

Log off remote connections when not in use.
Be vigilant against tailored spearphishing attacks targeting corporate and personal
accounts (including both email and social media accounts).
Use different passwords for corporate and personal accounts.
Install antivirus software on personal devices to automatically scan and quarantine
suspicious files.
Employ strong multi-factor authentication for personal accounts, if available.
Exercise caution when:
Opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected and the sender
appears to be known. See Using Caution with Email Attachments.
Using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs).
IT Staff/Cybersecurity Personnel
Segment and segregate networks and functions.
Change the default username and password of applications and appliances.
Employ strong multi-factor authentication for corporate accounts.
Deploy antivirus software on organizational devices to automatically scan and
quarantine suspicious files.
Apply encryption to data at rest and data in transit.
Use email security appliances to scan and remove malicious email attachments or
links.
Monitor key internal security tools and identify anomalous behavior. Flag any known
indicators of compromise or threat actor behaviors for immediate response.
Organizations can implement mitigations of varying complexity and restrictiveness to
reduce the risk posed by threat actors who use Tor (The Onion Router) to carry out
malicious activities. See the CISA-FBI Joint Cybersecurity Advisory on Defending
Against Malicious Cyber Activity Originating from Tor for mitigation options and
additional information.
Prevent exploitation of known software vulnerabilities by routinely applying software
patches and upgrades. Foreign cyber threat actors continue to exploit publicly known—
and often dated—software vulnerabilities against broad target sets, including public
and private sector organizations. If these vulnerabilities are left unpatched, exploitation
often requires few resources and provides threat actors with easy access to victim
networks. Review CISA and FBI’s Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities and other
CISA alerts that identify vulnerabilities exploited by foreign attackers.
Implement an antivirus program and a formalized patch management process.
Block certain websites and email attachments commonly associated with malware
(e.g., .scr, .pif, .cpl, .dll, .exe).
Block email attachments that cannot be scanned by antivirus software (e.g., .zip files).
Implement Group Policy Object and firewall rules.
Implement filters at the email gateway and block suspicious IP addresses at the
firewall.
7/9

Routinely audit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels to look for
situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of
a privileged account.
Follow best practices for design and administration of the network to limit privileged
account use across administrative tiers.
Implement a Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
(DMARC) validation system.
Disable or block unnecessary remote services.
Limit access to remote services through centrally managed concentrators.
Deny direct remote access to internal systems or resources by using network proxies,
gateways, and firewalls.
Limit unnecessary lateral communications.
Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong
passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Ensure applications do not store sensitive data or credentials insecurely.
Enable a firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection
requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure any scanned attachment is
its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to suspicious or risky sites. Contact
law enforcement or CISA immediately regarding any unauthorized network access
identified.
Visit the MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics pages linked in the ATT&CK Profile
section above for additional mitigation and detection strategies for this malicious
activity targeting think tanks.
