Key Findings
This report describes how Ethiopian dissidents in the US, UK, and other countries were
targeted with emails containing sophisticated commercial spyware posing as Adobe
Flash updates and PDF plugins. Targets include a US-based Ethiopian diaspora media
outlet, the Oromia Media Network (OMN), a PhD student, and a lawyer. During the
course of our investigation, one of the authors of this report was also targeted.
We found a public logfile on the spyware’s command and control server and
monitored this logfile over the course of more than a year. We saw the spyware’s
operators connecting from Ethiopia, and infected computers connecting from IP
addresses in 20 countries, including IP addresses we traced to Eritrean
companies and government agencies.
Our analysis of the spyware indicates it is a product known as PC Surveillance System
(PSS), a commercial spyware product with a novel exploit-free architecture. PSS is
offered by Cyberbit — an Israel-based cyber security company that is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Elbit Systems — and marketed to intelligence and law enforcement
agencies.

We conducted Internet scanning to find other servers associated with PSS and
found several servers that appear to be operated by Cyberbit themselves. The
public logfiles on these servers seem to have tracked Cyberbit employees as
they carried infected laptops around the world, apparently providing
demonstrations of PSS to the Royal Thai Army, Uzbekistan’s National Security
Service, Zambia’s Financial Intelligence Centre, the Philippine President’s
Malacañang Palace, ISS World Europe 2017 in Prague, and Milipol 2017 in Paris.
Cyberbit also appears to have provided other demos of PSS in France, Vietnam,
Kazakhstan, Rwanda, Serbia, and Nigeria.

1. Executive Summary
This report describes a campaign of targeted malware attacks apparently carried out by
Ethiopia from 2016 until the present. In the attacks we document, targets receive via email a
link to a malicious website impersonating an online video portal. When a target clicks on the
link, they are invited to download and install an Adobe Flash update (containing spyware)
before viewing the video. In some cases, targets are instead prompted to install a fictitious
app called “Adobe PdfWriter” in order to view a PDF file. Our analysis traces the spyware to
a heretofore unobserved player in the commercial spyware space: Israel’s Cyberbit, a whollyowned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. The spyware appears to be a product called PC
Surveillance System (PSS), recently renamed PC 360.
The attacks we first identified were targeted at Oromo dissidents based outside of Ethiopia,
including the Oromia Media Network (OMN). Oromia is the largest regional ethnic state of
Ethiopia by population and area, comprised mostly of the Oromo people.

We later discovered that the spyware’s command and control (C&C) server has a public
logfile that appears to show both operator and victim activity, allowing us to gain insight into
the identity of the operators and the targets. Based on our analysis of the logfile, it appears
that the spyware’s operators are inside Ethiopia, and that victims also include various
Eritrean companies and government agencies.
We scanned the Internet for similar C&C servers and found what appear to be several
servers used by Cyberbit. The public logfiles on those servers seem to have tracked Cyberbit
employees as they carried infected laptops around the world, apparently providing
demonstrations of PSS to various potential clients. The logfiles appear to place Cyberbit
employees at IP addresses associated with the Royal Thai Army, Uzbekistan’s National
Security Service, Zambia’s Financial Intelligence Centre, the Philippine President’s
Malacañang Palace, ISS World Europe 2017 in Prague, and Milipol 2017 in Paris. Cyberbit
also appears to have provided other demos to clients we could not identify in France,
Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Rwanda, Serbia, and Nigeria.

Figure 2: Countries with Ethiopian Cyberbit targets.
This report is the latest in a growing body of work that shows the wide abuse of nation-state
spyware by authoritarian leaders to covertly surveil and invisibly sabotage entities they deem
political threats. After FinFisher, Hacking Team, and NSO Group, Cyberbit is the fourth
vendor of nation-state spyware whose tools we have seen abused, and the second based in
Israel. Cyberbit’s PSS is also not the first spyware that Ethiopia has abused outside of its
borders: in 2015, we discovered that Ethiopia’s Information Network Security Agency (INSA)
was using Hacking Team’s RCS spyware to target US-based journalists at the Ethiopian
Satellite Television Service (ESAT). Ethiopia has also previously targeted dissidents using
FinFisher’s FinSpy spyware.
Citizen Lab has published a companion post outlining some of the legal and regulatory
issues raised by this investigation. We also sent letters to Cyberbit and Adobe concerning
the misuse of their respective products. Cyberbit responded on December 5, 2017, stating in
part: “we appreciate your concern and query and we are addressing it subject to the legal
and contractual confidentiality obligations Cyberbit Solutions is bound by.” Adobe responded
on December 6, 2017, stating in part: “we have taken steps to swiftly address this issue,
including but not limited to contacting Cyberbit and other relevant service providers.”

2. Background
2.1. Oromo Protests and Diaspora Media Outlets
Largely peaceful protests erupted in the Ethiopian state of Oromia in November 2015, in
response to a government decision to pursue a development project involving the razing of a
forest and football field. Protesters coalesced around opposition to a larger plan, the Addis
5/39

Ababa Master Plan, which they feared would displace some of the 2 million Oromo residents
living around Addis Ababa. The government labeled the protesters terrorists and responded
with lethal force and arbitrary arrests. Over the next year, security forces killed over 1000
people, many of them from Oromia, during anti-government protests. This culminated in a
state of emergency that was called in October 2016 that lasted over 10 months.
Oromia Media Network (OMN) is a US-based media channel that describes itself as an
“independent, nonpartisan and nonprofit news enterprise whose mission is to produce
original and citizen-driven reporting on Oromia, the largest and most populous state in
Ethiopia.” OMN broadcasts via satellite, and also has an Internet and social media
presence. According to Human Rights Watch, OMN “played a key role in disseminating
information throughout Oromia during the protests.” The government has “reportedly jammed
OMN 15 times since it began operations in 2014” and arrested individuals for providing
information to OMN or displaying the channel in their businesses.

2.2. Cyberbit and PSS
Cyberbit is an Israel-based cyber security company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Israeli
defense and homeland security manufacturer and contractor Elbit Systems. Cyberbit was
established in 2015 in order to “consolidate Elbit Systems’ activities relating to the Cyber
Intelligence and Cyber Security markets.” Cyberbit merged with the NICE Cyber and
Intelligence Division in 2015 after Elbit acquired that entity for approximately $158 million,
with Cyberbit reportedly taking on the division’s employees. Elbit had previously acquired C4
Security in June 2011 for $10.9 million; C4 described itself as “specializ[ing] in information
warfare, SCADA and military C&C systems security.“ According to one employee’s LinkedIn
page, C4 also developed a product called “PSS Surveillance System,” billed as a “solution[]
for intelligence and law enforcement agencies.” Cyberbit marketing materials1 refer to what
appears to be the same system: “CYBERBIT PC Surveillance System (PSS).” PSS is also
referenced on Elbit’s website as a solution “for collection from personal computers.” Elbit
reportedly will be reorganizing Cyberbit, effective as of 2018, to separate its defense and
commercial businesses, with Cyberbit continuing to operate the “C4i division and commercial
cyber business.” Elbit’s major subsidiaries are located in Israel and the United States, and
Elbit is listed on the NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

Figure 3: Screenshot of PSS Console (Source: Cyberbit Marketing Materials).
Cyberbit is the second Israel-based nation-state spyware vendor we have identified and
analyzed, the other being NSO Group. The two companies operate in the same market and
have even been connected with the same clients. In an extradition request for former
Panamanian President Martinelli, Panama alleged that Martinelli had directed the purchase
of two spyware products: PSS and NSO Group’s Pegasus. Additionally, a leaked Hacking
Team email about NSO claims that: “NSO only has mobile agents … Apparently the pc part
is handled by another company, PSS.”
Cyberbit describes PSS as “a comprehensive solution for monitoring and extracting
information from remote PCs.” As is standard in the marketing materials for spyware
companies, Cyberbit represents that their design “eliminat[es] the possibility that the
operation will be traced back to the origin.”

7/39

Figure 4: Data exfiltrated by PSS (Source: Cyberbit Marketing Materials).
Cyberbit says that PSS “helps LEAs and intelligence organizations to reduce crime, prevent
terrorism and maintain public safety by gaining access, monitoring, extracting and analyzing
information from remote PCs.” Information that PSS can monitor and extract includes “VoIP
calls, files, emails, audio recordings, keylogs and virtually any information available on the
target device.”

3. Targeting of Jawar Mohammed
Jawar Mohammed is the Executive Director of the Oromia Media Network (OMN). He is also
a prolific activist, with more than 1.2 million followers on Facebook. October 2, 2016 was the
annual Irreecha cultural festival, the most important Oromo cultural festival. Millions of
people each year gather at the festival site in Bishoftu, near Addis Ababa. In 2016, “scores of
people” died at the festival “following a stampede triggered by security forces’ use of teargas
and discharge of firearms in response to an increasingly restive crowd.” Jawar was active at
the time on social media in stoking the passions of Oromo on the ground, circulating both
verified and unverified information. On October 4, 2016, while in Minneapolis, USA, Jawar
received the email in Figure 5. He forwarded the email to Citizen Lab for analysis.

Figure 5: An email sent to Jawar on October 4, 2016. The sender most likely crafted
the email to make it appear that this was a forwarded message.
The site eastafro[.]net appears to impersonate the (legitimate) Eritrean video website
eastafro.com. When a target clicks on an operator-generated link to eastafro[.]net,
JavaScript on the site checks to see whether the target is using Windows and whether their
Adobe Flash Player is up to date. If the script detects a Windows user with an out-of-date
Flash Player, it displays a message asking the user to update their Flash Player. If clicked, or
after 15 seconds, the user is redirected to a page on getadobeplayer[.]com, which offers
the user a real Flash Player update bundled with spyware.

9/39

Figure 6: Message displayed when a target clicks on a link to eastafro[.]net.
If the user downloads and installs the malicious Flash update, their computer is infected. It is
clear that this is a targeted attack: if a user simply types in eastafro[.]net into their browser’s
address bar, they are redirected to the legitimate site, eastafro.com. If a user does the same
with getadobeplayer[.]com, they are served a “403 Forbidden” message. Both sites have
robots.txt files instructing search engines not to crawl them. Access to the spyware is
granted only if the user clicks on a link sent by the operator.
In all, Jawar received eleven emails between 5/30/2016 and 10/13/2016, and one more than
a year later on 11/22/2017. Each email contained links to what were purportedly videos on
eastafro[.]net, or Adobe Flash Player updates on getadobeplayer[.]com. The 11/22/2017
email contained a link to eastafro[.]net that asked the target to install “Adobe’s PdfWriter,” a
10/39

fictitious product. The download contained the same spyware as the malicious Adobe Flash
Player updates, but was packaged with CutePDF Writer, “a proprietary Portable Document
Format converter and editor for Microsoft Windows developed by Acro Software,” with no
connection to Adobe.

Figure 7: “Adobe PdfWriter” Installation Prompt.
In many cases, the operators appear to have registered their own accounts to send the
infection attempts. However, the email address sbo.radio88[@]gmail.com used by operators
to target Jawar is associated with the radio station of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). The
account may have been compromised.

The Ethiopian Government charged Jawar with terrorism in February 2017 under the criminal
code; Jawar and OMN denied all charges.

4. Investigation to Find Additional Targets
We set out to find additional targets. We conducted targeting testing of members of the
Oromo community using Himaya, our email scanning tool, to determine whether they had
received any similar malicious messages. We also found a public logfile on the spyware’s
C&C server (Section 5.2); the logfile listed IP addresses of infected devices and we were
able to identify additional victims based on their IP.

Bill Marczak is a researcher at Citizen Lab and an author of this report. Marczak was
targeted after he asked another target to forward an email sent by operators. At the time, the
target’s email account was compromised (the target had been previously infected with this
spyware). On March 29, 2017, while in San Francisco, USA, Marczak received a message
entitled “Martin Plaut and Ethiopia’s politics of famine,” from
networkoromostudies2015[@]gmail.com. The email contained a link to eastafro[.]net.

Figure 8: Message received by Citizen Lab Senior Research Fellow Bill Marczak. The
use of the Comic Sans font is due to the attacker’s font selection.
Other Targets: Several malicious emails we found were sent to multiple receipients,
according to their headers. We found 39 additional email addresses of targets using this
method; at least 12 addresses appear to be linked to targets active on Oromo issues, or
working for Oromo groups.

4.2. Logfile Analysis
Peculiarly, we found a public logfile on the spyware’s C&C server; the logfile recorded activity
that allowed us to geolocate (or in some cases, identify) victims. We analyzed more than a
year of logs showing victim (and operator) activity. Each logfile entry contains a unique
identifier (a GUID) associated with the infection, a value indicating whether the entry records
victim or operator activity, the IP address that the infected device (or operator) connected to
the C&C server from, and finally a timestamp showing when the communication took place
(for more details on the logfile, see Section 4.3). The format of the logfile allowed us to track
infections as they moved between different IP addresses, such as when an infected target
carried their laptop between home and work, or while traveling.
During more than a year of monitoring the server’s logfiles, we observed 67 different GUIDs.
All infections were operated by the same operator, who only ever used one IP address,
which belongs to a satellite connection (except for a three hour period on a single day when
the operator’s activity “failed over” to two other IP addresses, one address in Ethiopia and
one VPN, perhaps due to transient satellite connection failure). We identified 11 of the 67
GUIDs as likely resulting from testing by the operator, or execution by researchers, based on
their apparent short duration. Further, we noted that some GUIDs likely referenced the same

13/39

infected device, as they represented consecutive, non-overlapping infections whose IP
addresses corresponded with the same Internet Service Provider (ISP). This was the case
for two GUIDs in the UK, two in South Sudan, and 12 in Uganda.
We arrived at 43 GUIDs that we believe represent distinct infected devices. We then sought
to geolocate each infection to a country. We first ran the MaxMind GeoLite 2 Country
database on each IP and associated a set of countries with each infection. For each infection
that had only one country associated with it, we examined a small number of IP addresses
from the infection, to see whether those IPs looked like they were actually in that country, or
whether geolocation may have been incorrect due to the IP being associated with a VPN or
satellite connection.
For infections that MaxMind associated with multiple countries, we determined the dominant
country, based on the country with the largest number of logfile entries for that infection. For
the dominant country, we checked a small number of IP addresses to make sure the
geolocation was correct. For the other countries, we checked each IP in an attempt to
eliminate incorrect geolocation. We noted four infections that predominantly connected from
satellite connections, which MaxMind geolocated to UK or UAE; we changed the geolocation
of these devices to Eritrea, as the infections either “failed over” to IPs registered to EriTel, or
shared the same satellite IP address as other infections that “failed over” to EriTel IPs.
Table 4: Number of infections we geolocated to each country, for countries where we
geolocated more than one infection.

Other countries in which we saw only a single infected device were: Belgium, Egypt,
Ethiopia, UK, India, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Qatar, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, and
Yemen.
After we eliminated VPN IPs, and geolocated the four infections that predominantly
connected from satellite connections, we found that 40 of 43 infections only ever
communicated from a single country. The remaining three devices appear to have travelled
between several countries. The three infections that traveled internationally are as follows:
14/39

A device that twice travelled from Eritrea (via Germany) to the United Nations in
Geneva. We geolocated this device to Eritrea.
A device that predominantly connected from the University of Tsukuba in Japan that
travelled to Eritrea. We geolocated this device to Japan.
A device that predominantly connected from York University in Canada that travelled to
Eritrea. We geolocated this device to Canada.
We were able to trace six of the infections (five in Eritrea, one abroad) to Eritrean
government agencies or companies, suggesting that operators are likely targeting members
of the Eritrean government in addition to Ethiopian dissidents.

4.3. Other Attacker Sites
During our analysis, we identified two other websites sharing the same IP address as
getadobeplayer[.]com, which also appear to have been used by the same attackers to target
victims with the same spyware: diretube.co[.]uk (impersonating diretube[.]com, an
Ethiopian video site), and meskereme[.]net (impersonating meskerem[.]net, an Eritrean
opposition website).
The diretube.co[.]uk site used the same Adobe Flash update ploy to direct users to
malware on getadobeplayer[.]com, whereas the meskereme[.]net site displays a message
saying “Problem reading Tigrinya? Install these fonts,” with links to the fonts bundled with
spyware. The legitimate website, meskerem[.]net displays the same message, but links to
fonts without the spyware.

5. Attribution to Cyberbit and Ethiopia
This section describes how we attributed the spyware to Cyberbit and Ethiopia.

5.1. Digital Signature Points to Cyberbit
By monitoring getadobeplayer[.]com, we found and analyzed five samples of the spyware as
it was updated over time.

Each sample communicates with two command and control (C&C) servers: time-local[.]com
and time-local[.]net.
We found a structurally similar sample (see Section 7 for details on structural similarities) in
VirusTotal:
MD5: 376f28fb0aa650d6220a9d722cdb108d
SHA1: c7b4b97369a2ca77e916d5175d162dc2b823763b

That sample communicated with a C&C server at the following URL:
pssts1.nozonenet[.]com/ts8/ts8.php (note the use of “PSS” in the URL). The sample also
drops an EXE file containing a digital signature (valid as of the date submitted to VirusTotal)
produced by a certificate with the following details:
CN = C4 Security
O = C4 Security
STREET = 13 Noach Mozes St
L = Tel aviv
S = Gush Dan
PostalCode = 67442
C = IL
RFC822 Name=tal.barash@c4-security.com
Note that c4-security.com was the official website of C4 security, according to a brochure
posted on the website of the Israeli Export Institute.

5.2. Public Logfile Analysis Points to Ethiopia and Cyberbit
While monitoring additional PSS C&C servers that we discovered during scanning (Section
6.1), we found that one of these servers temporarily exposed a directory listing in response
to a normal GET / HTTP/1.1 request (Figure 9). The directory listing contained the text:
“Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at cyberbitc[.]com Port 80,” indicating that the server was
associated with Cyberbit. The website cyberbitc[.]com is owned by Cyberbit and was used
by Cyberbit before they acquired cyberbit[.]com in March 2017.2

16/39

Figure 9: Directory listing on one of the servers that earlier matched our fingerprint.
This directory listing also revealed the existence of several files, including a file called
rec.dat, which at first glance we noticed was encoded in binary format. We suspected that
rec.dat might be a logfile, as it appeared to be constantly updated on the C&C servers. We
noticed that rec.dat existed on all of the C&C servers we detected in our scanning and were
able to test (Section 6.1), including on time-local[.]com and time-local[.]net, the C&C servers
associated with the spyware samples sent to Oromo targets.

5.2.1. Logfile Analysis Shows Ethiopian Operator
To verify our logfile hypothesis, we performed a test infection of a virtual machine using one
of the samples sent to Oromo targets and we allowed the virtual machine to communicate
with the C&C server. The traffic comprised HTTP POST requests (Section 7.7), each of
which contained an agentid, a GUID initially {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}
and later nonzero.
After the infection, we downloaded rec.dat and found that it contained a series of records,
several with our IP address, and our agentid GUID, in binary form. Each record of the logfile
is delimited by the string \x41\x41\x41 (‘AAA’) and can be parsed with the following regular
expression:
‘(.{4})\x00\x00(.)(.{4})(.{16})AAA’
The first group of four bytes is a UNIX timestamp, the second group of 1 byte is a type value
(which, in our testing was always 2, 17, 21, 33, or 37), the third group of 4 bytes is an IP
address, and the fourth group of 16 bytes is a GUID. The file appears to be a circular (i.e.,

17/39

size-capped) logfile stored in binary format whose maximum size is defined in config.ini to be
10MB. Old entries are removed from the front of the file as new entries are written to the end.
Peculiarly, we noticed additional entries in rec.dat with our GUID but with a different IP
address, 207.226.46.xxx. We noticed that 207.226.46.xxx was also associated with every
other GUID in rec.dat. We determined that this IP address is associated with a satellite
connection.
Over a period of more than a year, we downloaded and analyzed this file at regular intervals,
obtaining a total of 388 rec.dat samples from each of time-local[.]com and time-local[.]net
(we also began pulling samples of rec.dat from new servers we detected in scanning). Our
rec.dat files from time-local[.]com contain more than 32 million entries (more than 28 million
entries are operator interactions and approximately 4 million are victim interactions).
In all of our rec.dat samples from time-local[.]com and time-local[.]net, we noted that entries
in the logfile for all GUIDs with types 2, 21, and 33 only ever involved the IP address
207.226.46.xxx (except for a brief period of three hours on a single day, where we saw the
activity “fail over” between 207.226.46.xxx and two other IP addresses, one VPN address,
and one address in Ethiopia). Thus, we suspect that types 2, 21, and 33 represent
interaction by the operator. We suspect that types 17 and 37 correspond to interactions by
infected devices.
Table 6: IP addresses that the Ethiopian operator connected from.

That the attacker’s activity “failed over” between their satellite IP and an Ethio Telecom
address suggests that the operator is inside Ethiopia.
5.2.2. Thirteen Servers Show a Cyberbit Nexus
Our scanning found 15 PSS C&C servers in all. Of those, two were the Ethiopia servers. Of
the remaining 13 we found, we suspect all are operated by Cyberbit, perhaps as
demonstration or development servers. Ten of the servers’ logfiles included the IP address
37.142.120.xxx, which is pointed to by a subdomain of cyberbit[.]net. Two other servers’
logfiles included the IP address 64.251.13.xxx, which also appeared in the logfile of one of
the seven servers, as an operator of infections connecting back from 37.142.13.xxx, an IP
address pointed to by a subdomain of cyberbit[.]net.

18/39

One of the servers, pupki[.]co, was unavailable when we tried to fetch rec.dat. The domain
name was registered to a “Yevgeniy Gavrikov”. An individual by this name currently works as
an “integration specialist” for Cyberbit, according to LinkedIn.

6. Other PSS Activity
6.1. Scanning for More C&C Servers
We fingerprinted the command and control (C&C) servers used by the spyware, timelocal[.]com and time-local[.]net, based on the fact that they typically returned the following
distinctive message upon a normal GET / HTTP/1.1 request:
PHP Configuration Error. Can not fetch xml request string
Over the course of our scanning, we found a total of 15 IP addresses matching this same
fingerprint.

6.2. Demonstration Websites
By examining sites on the same IP address as eastafro[.]net, we found two additional sites:
one site impersonating Download.com and one website impersonating the homepage of
Avira Antivirus. These sites contained versions of several apps bundled with PSS, including
Avira Antivirus, Ventrilo, Avast AntiVirus, and CCleaner. The versions of PSS we found
talked to C&C servers in the list above that we identified as Cyberbit-run servers.

6.3. Public Logfile Analysis of Other Servers
In addition to the Ethiopia servers (Section 5.2), we analyzed the logfiles of 12 of the 13
other servers. We were able to identify what we believe are several product demonstrations
to various clients around the world. Most of the demonstrations show similar patterns: activity
during business hours from IP addresses that appear to belong to potential clients and
activity off-hours at IP addresses that appear to belong to hotels. In a few cases, the activity
is preceded or followed by activity from what appears to be airport Wi-Fi access points.

Figure 10: Cyberbit product demonstrations suggested by C&C logfiles.
In our analysis here, we introduce a notion of a period of activity to try and abstract away
gaps between logfile entries that may be uninteresting. We say that a spyware infection is
active between two logfile entries (we only include activity from the infected device here, i.e.,
types 17 and 37) if there is no more than an hour in between the entries. We omit periods of
20/39

activity that are less than one minute from our consideration (except if they provide evidence
that the infected device has moved). In each country case we present here, we are listing all
the activity we found across the nine Cyberbit-operated C&C servers (perhaps excluding
periods of activity less than a minute).

6.3.1. Timeline of Suspected Demonstrations
3/2016: Thailand (2 days). We found infections in Thailand from the IP 202.29.97.X, in
AS4621, which appears to be an ASN used by various Thai universities. Tracerouting to
202.29.97.X yields the hop (royal-thai-army-to-902-1-5-gi-09-cr-pyt.uni.net.th). The IPs
202.29.97.(X-3) and 202.29.97.(X-1) return a TLS certificate whose CN is a subdomain of
signalschool[.]net, which is registered to the Royal Thai Army’s Signal School. We did note
that 202.29.97.X also appears to be a VPN. Nevertheless, it seems that the IP is under the
control of the Royal Thai Army. We also observed each infection changing between several
IPs that appear to belong to various mobile data providers.
The table below lists periods of activity for each infection; the first column (#) indicates the
number of the infection; the second and third columns provide the minimum and maximum
date and time of the period of activity (in the country’s local time, accounting for DST); the
fourth column provides the duration of the period of activity (H:MM:SS); and the fifth column
lists the location where the activity took place (or the likely identity of the agency receiving
the demonstration).

from an IP address pointed to by a subdomain of rdhotel[.]uz, which is registered by an
individual who is listed on LinkedIn as the manager of the Radisson Blu in Tashkent. The
latter two were from an IP address linked to Uzbekistan’s National Security Service by the
leaked Hacking Team emails.

address that is numerically adjacent to another IP address that returns a web interface for an
“HP MSM760 Controller” that displays the following information:
System name: Hilton Gardent Inn-HANOP
Location: Hanoi
We suspect that this activity is associated with the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel in Hanoi. The
other activity appears to be from mobile broadband IP addresses; the identity of the potential
client is not indicated by the data.

2/2017: Philippines (5 days). We found an infection in February 2017 at 116.50.244.15. The
IPs 116.50.244.10, 116.50.244.7, and 116.50.244.8 are pointed to by
manila.newworldhotels.com or subdomains thereof. 116.50.244.7 is a Cisco VPN login page,

23/39

which lists the “Group” as “New_World_Makati.” We assume that the Manila New World
Makati Hotel is also the owner of 116.50.244.15.
This was followed by an infection one day later at an IP address pointed to by a subdomain
of malacanang.gov[.]ph, which is the website of Malacañang Palace. The palace is the
primary residence and offices of the Philippine President (Rodrigo Duterte as of the date of
the demo). The Malacañang Palace infection was followed by an infection from two other IP
addresses in the Philippines.

6/2017: ISS World Europe (2 days). We saw four infections between 6/14/2017 and
6/15/2017 from IP address 82.142.85.165 in the Czech Republic. ISS World Europe 2017
was held in Prague, Czech Republic from 6/13/2017 – 6/15/2017, and Cyberbit gave a
presentation on 6/13/2017, according to the schedule. This same IP address appears in the
headers of leaked Hacking Team emails sent by two employees on 6/3/2015 and 6/4/2015.
These employees mentioned that they would be attending ISS World Europe on 6/3/2015,
held at the same venue as the 2017 ISS World Europe. The IP address 82.142.85.165 may
be associated with the Clarion Congress Hotel in Prague (the ISS World Europe venue).

11/2017: Philippines (6 days). In November 2017, we observed what appeared to be two
different Cyberbit employees travelling together from Israel to the New World Makati Hotel in
Manila.
The infections started out in Israel, one on 10/15/2017 and one on 11/2/2017. While in Israel,
and during the workweek (Sunday to Thursday), both infections connected from what
appears to be Cyberbit’s office (37.142.13.xxx, pointed to by two subdomains of
cyberbit[.]net) during business hours (roughly 09:00 – 18:00 local time). After hours, the
infections connected back from what we believe are home IP addresses of the employees.
Each infection connected back from different home IPs during overlapping periods, which
leads us to believe that the two infections represent different Cyberbit employees. It appears
that each employee was carrying an infected laptop between home and the office each day
(perhaps for spyware development and testing purposes).
After they last connected from Israel, one infection connected 15 hours later from Hong Kong
for six minutes, between 14:52 and 14:58 local time. The infections then connected from the
Philippines (116.50.244.xxx) as early as 22:41 local time, suggesting a flight itinerary from Tel
Aviv to Manila, by way of Hong Kong.

active from an IP address 185.113.160.20, which appears to be associated with the Paris
Nord Villepinte exhibition center. The IP is pointed to by several subdomains of

27/39

villepinte2017.dynu[.]net and also by pnv.vipnetwork[.]fr. The Milipol Paris 2017 exhibition
was held between 11/21 and 11/24 and the Paris Nord Villepinte exhibition center. Thus, it
appears that Cyberbit employees were performing demos there.

6.3.2. Suspected Researcher Activity
We found several short-lived infections on Cyberbit-operated servers that seem less likely to
be purposeful infections and more consistent with activity by cybersecurity researchers or
other testing activity. We group activity that is temporally similar below, though it is unclear if
this activity is related.
We found one infection in the UK on 11/10/2016 lasting ~15s.
We found one infection from Google on 2/7/2017 (lasting 11m), followed by three infections
in Germany on 2/7/2017 and 2/8/2017. In Germany, there was one initial infection 14
minutes after the Google infection, with a single pingback. 2h10m later, there was an
infection lasting 1 minute. 13h later, there was an infection with a single pingback.
We found an infection with a single pingback from an IP address in Everett, Washington,
USA on 10/17/2017. We found two overlapping infections in Russia on 10/18/2017 (~2m
each), followed 20 minutes later by two infections in China, 45 minutes apart (~30s each).
We found a ~20s infection in Canada on 10/19/2017.
We found an infection with a single pingback from an IP address registered to Brandon
University in Canada on 10/31/2017. We found two infections in Norway on 11/1/2017 (one
infection with a single pingback, and one infection 3m30s later lasting for ~20s).

28/39

6.3.3. Unexplained Activity
We found several infections on the Cyberbit-operated PSS C&C servers that were longrunning, and not from VPN connections or from countries where Cyberbit has a known
presence. Thus, this activity did not immediately seem to represent demonstrations or
development activity. We found one infection in Iran between 9/20/2016 and 11/22/2016. We
found one infection in Canada between 3/7/2017 and 11/22/2017. We found one infection in
Finland between 5/26/2017 and 11/28/2017. We found one infection in Indonesia from
10/28/2017 to 11/10/2017. We found one infection in Slovakia from a single IP address
active between 11/1/2017 and 12/1/2017. We found one infection in Ethiopia from
10/25/2017 to 12/1/2017, with no known overlap with the Ethiopia client’s IP address space.

6.4. Spoofed Code Signing Certificates?
We identified several cases where we suspect that the spyware operators, or Cyberbit
themselves, obtained digital certificates in the names of real companies, including an Israeli
intellectual property law firm.
One malicious Adobe Flash executable we found used by the Ethiopian operator was signed
by an authenticode certificate issued by Comodo to a named entity called “Flashpoint IP.”
CN = Flashpoint IP
O = Flashpoint IP
STREET = 2nd Raban Gamliel
L = Elad
S = Israel
PostalCode = 40800
C = IL
RFC822 Name=ben.wiseman@flashpoint-ip.com
We found a company called “Flash Point IP,” with the same street address as in the digital
certificate, included the Patent Attorneys Ledger published by Israel’s Ministry of Justice. The
website listed by the Ministry of Justice for the firm is flashpointip.com. However, the
website in the certificate’s RFC822 name appears to be a lookalike domain that is subtly
different: flashpoint-ip[.]com.
We examined the WHOIS registration of the lookalike domain flashpoint-ip[.]com:
Registrant Name: BEN WISEMAN
Registrant Organization: FLASHPOINT IP LTD
Registrant Street: RABAN GAMLIEL 2
Registrant City: ELAD
Registrant State/Province: SHOMRON
Registrant Postal Code: 40800

29/39

Registrant Country: IL
Registrant Phone: +972.525649427
Registrant Email: BENWISEMAN99@GMAIL.COM
The firm’s website, flashpointip.com, has a New York registration address, a different
registrant name, and a @bezeqint.net contact address.
We found one additional domain, cd-media4u[.]com, registered with the same phone
number as flashpoint-ip[.]com. The WHOIS information is:
Registrant Name: DAN WISEMAN
Registrant Organization: C. D. MEDIA LTD
Registrant Street: BEN YEHUDA 60
Registrant City: TEL AVIV
Registrant State/Province: TEL AVIV
Registrant Postal Code: 6343107
Registrant Country: IL
Registrant Phone: +972.525649427
Registrant Email: DANWISEMAN99@GMAIL.COM
Note the similar names Dan Wiseman and Ben Wiseman and the similar email addresses
danwiseman99@gmail.com and benwiseman99@gmail.com. We found one reference to
“CD Media Ltd” which appears to be an Israeli software publisher (http://www.cdmedia.co.il/).
Given that we found two instances where the same entity (WHOIS phone number
+972.525649427) registered what appear to be lookalike domains for two different Israeli
companies, it is possible that these certificates may have been improperly obtained. This is
not the first instance in which improperly obtained digital certificates may have been used
with commercial spyware. Hacking Team appears to have obtained several digital certificates
in the names of people whose passport photos appeared on a now-defunct site,
thewhistleblowers[.]org.4
[January 12, 2018 update: Following publication of this report, FlashPoint IP Ltd. (FPIP)
confirmed in a letter to the Citizen Lab that “the referenced digital certificate…was not
obtained by FPIP, and upon information and belief was obtained unlawfully… The alleged
misuse of the FPIP name and address is absolutely illegal and without FPIP’s knowledge,
and certainly was never approved by any authorized representative.” Additionally, FPIP
noted that it sent a cease and desist letter to Cyberbit, which responded “with a general
denial of any wrongdoing or unlawful activity on their part, and rejecting the assertions raised
in the FPIP letter. Nonetheless, their letter mentioned (without any admission/consent or
prejudice to their rights) that Cyberbit shall take steps to ensure that its products do not use
the FPIP name or address or any certificate bearing the FPIP name.”]

30/39

We identified two further digital certificates used by the operators, in the names of “Etefaq
Consulting Ltd,” and “Emerging European Capital.” These certificates were on samples we
downloaded from getadobeplayer[.]com, as well as samples from the Avira Antivirus and
Download.com impersonation websites (Section 6.2). Unfortunately, the signatures did not
contain the RFC822 Name field, so we do not have any indications as to their legitimacy.
CN = Emerging European Capital
O = Emerging European Capital
STREET = Svaetoplukova 12
L = Bojnice
S = Slovakia
PostalCode = 97201
C = SK
We found what appears to be the website of “Emerging European Capital” (http://eecap.com), which is described as a company offering “Private Banking services to High Net
Worth Individuals in Central and Eastern Europe.” The address in the digital certificate
matches an address listed on the website. The individual mentioned on the website, Martin
Masar, appears to be a real individual, and is listed as serving on the Supervisory Board of
Petrocommerce Ukraine Bank. However, without more information, we cannot know whether
the digital certificate is legitimate or not.
CN = ETEFAQ CONSULTING LIMITED
O = ETEFAQ CONSULTING LIMITED
STREET = 1 MYKONOS STREET
L = NICOSIA
S = NICOSIA
PostalCode = 1045
C = CY
We found an “ETEFAQ CONSULTING LIMITED” in the Cyprus corporate registry (# ΗΕ
329071). However, the registered address did not match the address in the digital certificate.
The company’s line of business is unclear, and it appears to maintain a simple (hacked)
website with a “Contact Us” form (http://etefaqconsulting.com/).

7. Technical Analysis of the Spyware
Altogether, we analyzed nine samples. This includes the sample from VirusTotal signed by
the “C4 Security” certificate (Section 5.1), as well as five samples gathered from
getadobeplayer[.]com, and three samples gathered from the Avira Antivirus and
Download.com impersonation websites (Section 6.2).

31/39

Based on strings found during our analysis of configuration files used by the spyware, these
samples cover versions of PSS ranging from v4.3.3 to 6.1.0. Major version changes contain
changes to obfuscation techniques, overall structure, and general functionality, while minor
version changes seem to contain smaller, less noticeable changes. The following analysis
covers the general behavior and characteristics of PSS, with version-specific differences
noted where appropriate.

7.1. Overview
Overall, the samples we analyzed are made up of four main components: the Agent,
LnkProxy, Payload DLL, and Pipeserver. The Agent is the main program responsible for
providing operators remote access to an infected machine and carries out most activity after
infection. If the Agent is not installed with administrator privileges, then the LnkProxy
facilitates the replacement of shortcut (lnk) and executable (exe) files with malicious versions
that will try to trick the user into granting administrator privileges to the Agent. The Payload
DLL is a small DLL file that is used to infect certain whitelisted DLLs as a persistence
mechanism, to ensure that the Agent is running. Finally, the Pipeserver is used to
coordinate access to global handles and perform network communication.

32/39

Each of these four components is packed and stored inside the initial spyware payload. The
earliest version we analyzed (4.3.3) stored these files as either plaintext or as zlib
compressed data. Later versions added AES-256-CBC encryption and the use of different
keys per dropped component for additional obfuscation (Section 7.3).

7.2. Installation and Persistence
Once a victim executes one of the initial payloads (e.g., a fake Adobe Flash update), the
spyware unpacks the Agent component (described in Section 7.4) and saves it to
%TEMP%\Profile. Then, the spyware checks to see if it is running with administrator
privileges. If so, then the spyware executes the dropped Agent; if not, then the spyware
unpacks and installs the LnkProxy component (described in Section 7.5) in an attempt to
trick the user into giving it administrator privileges.
Once the dropped Agent has been executed with administrator privileges, either via the main
installer or by tricking the user via the LnkProxy technique, the Agent unpacks its
configuration file into memory. Next, the Agent checks to see if there is already a version of
PSS installed on the victim’s system by checking for the existence of the storage directory
used by the spyware. Depending on the configuration of the current and previous Agents, the
Agent may either replace the existing agent or attempt to upgrade the old version. If PSS is
not already installed, then the Agent begins installation.
The Agent creates its main storage directory at %CommonAppData%\Profile. Then, it
writes its configuration file into the storage directory, using a name defined in the
configuration file (versions 4.x and 5.x use the filename diskdrv.dll, while version 6.x uses
igfxcls.cfg). The Agent then copies itself into the storage directory (versions 4.x and 5.x use
the filename crisvc.exe for the agent, while version 6.x use the filename igfxcri.exe) while
deleting the dropped copy from %TEMP%\Profile.
Next, the Agent unpacks and drops 32- and 64-bit versions of the PipeServer component
into the storage directory. These files are named mssvt.dll and mssvt64.dll across all
versions of PSS that we have analyzed.
After it has created the necessary files, the spyware sets up its persistence mechanism by
infecting copies of certain DLLs on the system with the Payload DLL (which is not saved to
disk as a standalone file). The infected copies are placed in the same folder as the
executable that will load them, ensuring that the infected DLLs are loaded instead of their
legitimate counterparts that may be in other folders (Windows will search the folder
containing the application first). The DLLs we saw chosen for infection are related to
common web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Since web
browsers are some of the most commonly used applications on computers, these DLLs are a
good choice to ensure that the spyware is running most of the time that the target device is
being used.

33/39

Finally, the spyware initializes the appropriate PipeServer component by creating a new
Desktop, referred to as a “HiddenDesktop” by the spyware and launching one or more of the
EXEs whose DLLs have been replaced with infected versions on this new desktop. When an
infected DLL is loaded (Section 5.6), it launches the PipeServer if not already running; the
PipeServer in turn launches the Agent if not already running. The Agent then enters into its
main command handling loop.

7.3. Obfuscation
The first version of the spyware we analyzed (4.3.3) stored most components as either
plaintext data or as zlib compressed binary data. Version 5.x of PSS introduced the
additional use of AES-256-CBC encryption for the components. Components obfuscated in
this manner contain a short header struct followed by the AES-256-CBC encrypted, zlib
compressed data:
struct HEADER {
char[6]: magic_number
uint32: iv
uint32: checksum
uint32: length
}
In this header struct, magic_number is the magic_number for a 7z file [0x37, 0x7a, 0xbc,
0xaf, 0x27, 0x1c], iv is the first 4 bytes of the initialization vector used in the AES cipher,
checksum is a CRC32 checksum of the data, and length is the length of the encrypted data.
The initialization vector is padded with null bytes to the correct length for the AES-256-CBC
cipher. Version 6.x added an additional data format for AES-256-CBC encrypted data that
removes the magic_number. For all versions, the AES key is hardcoded in the executable
performing the decryption. Beginning with version 6.x, the spyware additionally began to
obfuscate strings, deobfuscating them only when needed.
Version 4.x drops all of its various components directly to disk in an unpacked form when
installed. Starting with version 5.x, the spyware began to drop intermediate loader
executables instead of final components. These loader executables store a component, often
the Agent, in the same AES-256-CBC encrypted, zlib compressed format as above. When
executed, these loaders mimic the Windows executable loader by unpacking their stored
payload, mapping the unpacked PE file’s sections into memory, and resolving any imports
before jumping to the PE’s entrypoint. This technique of storing the unpacked component
only in memory is likely an attempt to evade static, file-based analysis and detection
techniques.
Within the Agent component, the configuration file is an SQLite database obfuscated using
bzip compression, followed by XOR encryption using both the current and previous bytes,
along with one byte from the key. This obfuscation format, and an unusual 36-byte XOR key,
34/39

the string DC615DA9-94B5-4477-9C33-3A393BC9E63F, are shared across all the samples
we analyzed.

7.4. The Agent
The Agent is the central component of the spyware and is responsible for carrying out most
of the behavior of PSS. The Agent is a feature-rich spyware capable of a wide range of
behaviors. Across all samples we analyzed, we have seen the following capabilities:
Audio/Video recording including scheduling recordings for a later time
Reading browser history and stored passwords
Filesystem operations including creating, deleting, moving, renaming, uploading, and
downloading files
Editing/Querying registry keys
Geolocation based on available wifi networks
Accessing Skype databases, call logs, and contacts
Listing network connections and devices
Starting/Stopping processes
Taking screenshots
Keylogging
Accessing clipboard data
Accessing recently used file list

7.5. LnkProxy
The LnkProxy component is only used when the spyware is initially installed without
Administrator privileges. In this scenario, the spyware searches through the Windows
Desktop, Start Menu, and Quick Launch folders looking for lnk and exe files. Any files it finds
are replaced with malicious copies designed to request administrator privileges, launch the
legitimate application, and then launch the spyware. This process is designed to trick the
user into giving PSS administrator privileges.
The LnkProxy makes a backup of all replaced files, which are restored upon spyware
uninstallation or when the user unwittingly grants the spyware administrator privileges.

7.6. Payload DLL
The Payload component of the spyware is a short DLL that is used to infect whitelisted DLLs
on the victim’s system as a persistence mechanism. During installation, the spyware
searches the victim’s computer for targeted DLLs and for each that it finds it appends the
Payload component to the targeted DLL’s .text section. The entrypoint of the DLL is then
changed to point to this appended code and the infected file is copied to the same directory

35/39

as the application that uses the DLL. This ensures that the infected DLL is loaded by the
application instead of the original, uninfected version. Figure 11 shows an example of a
modified binary infected with the Payload component.

Figure 11: Comparison of entrypoint before and after Payload infection.
The infected DLL starts by checking to ensure that the infected DLL is being loaded by the
target program only. It does this by calling the original entrypoint for the infected DLL to get
the ImagePathName field of the ProcessParameters struct in the Process Environment Block
(PEB). The ImagePathName contains the path of the currently running executable. This is
then compared to a hardcoded checksum value stored in the DLL as part of the infection
process.
If this check succeeds, the Payload then performs its functions. It first checks to see if the
PipeServer is currently loaded. It does this by decrypting an XOR-encrypted string in the DLL
containing the location of the PipeServer component, calculating a checksum of this string,
and then walking the InMemoryOrder list of loaded modules, checksumming the

36/39

ImagePathName of each and comparing it to the checksum of the PipeServer’s path. If the
PipeServer is not currently loaded, the infected DLL loads the PipeServer component and
transfers execution to it.

7.7. PipeServer
The PipeServer component starts by unpacking and loading a small configuration file. This is
a small file containing ASCII strings separated by \x00’s that define various config options
used by the PipeServer. In version 6.x, this file is zlib compressed and encrypted using AES256-CBC. After loading the configuration file, the PipeServer creates a series of threads,
global events, and mutexes that are used to synchronize actions between components of the
spyware, log messages, and communicate with the command and control server. Next, the
PipeServer creates a named pipe for communication with running Agent components.
Finally, the PipeServer starts an instance of the Agent if one is not already active before
entering a main command handling loop. The spyware uses a XML-based networking
protocol for command and control communication. Each request and response is sent as a
“transaction.” An example of the XML format used is given below.
<?xml version=”1.0″>
<transaction
type=”fromagent”
agentid=”<ID>”
sn=”<NUM>”
crc=”<CRC>”
encoding=”base64″
encryption=”aes-256″
compression=”<zip|none>”>
<DATA>
</transaction>
DATA is the information to be communicated and is compressed, encrypted, and encoded as
described in the response attributes. The AES key used can be either a master key included
in the Agent’s configuration or an individual private key created after the malware has been
installed and initialized. The master key is hard-coded and is the same across all samples
we analyzed.

8. Conclusion
We have uncovered the use of PC Surveillance System (PSS) spyware by what appears to
be agencies of the Ethiopian government to target dozens of individuals. Our investigation
shows these targets include an Oromo media outlet based in the United States, OMN, a PhD
student, and a lawyer who have worked on Oromo issues, as well as a Citizen Lab Research
Fellow, Bill Marczak. Our analysis also indicates apparent demonstrations of the spyware in

37/39

several other countries where leaders have exhibited authoritarian tendencies, and/or where
there are political corruption and accountability challenges, such as Nigeria, Philippines,
Rwanda, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.
The habitual misuse of spyware by the Ethiopian government against civil society targets is
testament to the lack of repercussions for such behavior by states and complicity within the
commercial spyware industry that supplies them. Evidence indicating the Ethiopian
government’s misuse of spyware (including Hacking Team’s RCS and Gamma Group’s
FinSpy) against journalists, activists, and others has been laid out in prior research over
multiple years, as well as in a lawsuit filed in US federal court. In a portentous ruling, that suit
was dismissed on grounds that a tort is not committed entirely in the US — a showing of
which was required to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign — when a government’s
digital espionage is conceived of and operated from overseas, despite the fact that the
infection occurs and harm is experienced within the US. The digital nature of the tort
essentially allowed a foreign government to violate US laws with impunity. Unsurprisingly, as
this report makes clear, the extraterritorial targeting continues, as do spyware sales to
Ethiopia.
This report also uncovers another player in the nation-state spyware business: Cyberbit, the
company that provides PSS. As a provider of powerful surveillance technology, Cyberbit has
the responsibility under both Israel’s export control regime as well as the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights to concern itself with the potential for human
rights abuses facilitated through use of its product. The fact that PSS wound up in the hands
of Ethiopian government agencies, which for many years have demonstrably misused
spyware to target civil society, raises urgent questions around Cyberbit’s corporate social
responsibility and due diligence efforts, and the effectiveness of Israel’s export controls in
preventing human rights abuses. The apparent locations of PSS demonstrations reinforce
those concerns. Moreover, the manner in which the PSS spyware operates suggests that, to
achieve infection, the spyware preys on user trust in legitimate third-party companies and
software, such as Adobe Systems, or the code-signing certificate verification process. These
techniques undermine security in the larger digital ecosystem and contravene terms of
service as well as clear legal standards that exist in many jurisdictions to prevent
appropriation of intellectual property. If spyware companies themselves incorporate such
techniques in order to build a successful product, action is necessary to address the negative
externalities that result. We have sent a letter to Cyberbit regarding these issues and
received a response.
As we explore in a separate analysis, while lawful access and intercept tools have legitimate
uses, the significant insecurities and illegitimate targeting we have documented that arise
from their abuse cannot be ignored. In the absence of stronger norms and incentives to
induce state restraint, as well as more robust regulation of spyware companies, we expect

38/39

that authoritarian and other politically corrupt leaders will continue to obtain and use spyware
to covertly surveil and invisibly sabotage the individuals and institutions that hold them to
account.
