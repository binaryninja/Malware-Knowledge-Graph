How to expose a potential cybercriminal due to
misconfigurations
cybergeeks.tech/how-to-expose-a-potential-cybercriminal-due-to-misconfigurations

Summary
We’ve investigated a new phishing campaign spreading malicious documents that exploit the
CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882 vulnerabilities.
The purpose of this campaign is to deploy the Lokibot stealer on the infected machines. In
our investigation we found misconfigurations on the malicious domains that allowed us to
identify a hostname which was a name server for two scam domains registered in Brazil.
We believe that the owner of these domains might be involved in the malicious campaign.
Technical analysis
We begin the analysis with a document that impersonates the Romanian ANAF (National
Agency for Fiscal Administration) called “Factura fiscala ANAF270622.xlsx” (SHA256:
098335ca421ca8501fd243714fd02457ebbaa40dd6f91cf1ab61a58c415a27a0). The
document was downloaded from https://app.any.run/tasks/e5624c90-9c9c-4f35-a80a3beed6370c35/.
The malicious document is a xlsx file that contains a blurred image which seems to be an
invoice, as highlighted below:

The file is an encrypted Excel document with a common password (“VelvetSweatshop”), as
shown below:

Using oledump it`s possible to determine that there is an embedded OLE object in the
document:

The document tries to exploit a vulnerability found in Microsoft Office and WordPad, that is
described in CVE-2017-0199 . If successful, the malware would download a file found at
http[:]//itssotiny.com/fYYbO (returns 404 at this time). However, according to VirusTotal, the
link redirected to http[:]//192.3.239.42/document/77.doc (still active). Figure 5 reveals that
there are two documents hosted in the same location:

The 77.doc file is an obfuscated RTF file, which exploits the another Microsoft Office
vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882 :

The rtfdump.py script is utilized to list groups and the structure of the RTF file:

The Microsoft Equation Editor process that can be identified in the sandbox analysis is a
strong indicator that the vulnerability is indeed CVE-2017-11882, which is a vulnerability in
Microsoft Equation Editor (https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilitiesand-exploits/17-year-old-ms-office-flaw-cve-2017-11882-actively-exploited-in-the-wild).
The final stage consists of downloading the Lokibot stealer from
http[:]//192.3.239.42/77/vbc.exe
(https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d243ac3d475a2e3dad62640525d3b4f102bb8140cc84436

Due to the attacker’s mistake, phpinfo.php can be accessed by anybody and reveals crucial
information about the potential attacker. As we can see in figure 8, the hostname is “WIN2NF07F1AQLT” and it runs on a Windows Server 2016 machine:

Figure 8
We have expended the attacker’s infrastructure via OSINT. The following files/IP addresses
could be identified:
http[:]//192.3.239.42/receipt/88.doc
http[:]//192.3.239.42/receipt/99.doc
http[:]//192.227.129.26/document/receipt.doc
http[:]//192.3.239.42/office/100.doc
http[:]//192.3.239.42/office/110.doc
192.227.168.194, 107.175.218.40, 104.168.32.21, 104.168.32.14
As we can see in figure 9, the hostname is the same for a different domain:

We have identified another hostname for an older campaign – “WIN-3JS0MA784YQ”:

Figure 10
We’ve performed an OSINT investigation and found that the “WIN-2NF07F1AQLT” hostname
appears as a name server for two domains registered in Brazil: Webcamer.com[.]br and
Citydesconto.com[.]br. According to website.informer.com, these 2 domains were registered
by an individual “Noe Yvert Etoua Evina” with the noeyvert@gmail.com email address:

These two domains seem to be scam domains. An individual with the same name appears in
multiple judicial processes on jusbrasil.com.br.
