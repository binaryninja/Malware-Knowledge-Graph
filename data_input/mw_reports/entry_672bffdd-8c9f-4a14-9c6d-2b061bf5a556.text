host malware

Introduction
Cisco Talos recently discovered a threat actor attempting to take advantage of Americans who
may be seeking a job, especially military veterans. The actor, previously identiﬁed by Symantec
as Tortoiseshell, deployed a website called hxxp://hiremilitaryheroes[.]com that posed as a
website to help U.S. military veterans ﬁnd jobs. The URL is strikingly close to the legitimate
service from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, https://www.hiringourheroes.org. The site prompted
users to download an app, which was actually a malware downloader, deploying malicious spying
tools and other malware.
This is just the latest actions by Tortoiseshell. Previous research showed that the actor was
behind an attacker on an IT provider in Saudi Arabia. For this campaign Talos tracked,
Tortoiseshell used the same backdoor that it has in the past, showing that they are relying on
some of the same tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).

Fake veteran hiring website
The fake website, called "Hire Military Heroes" (hxxp://hiremilitaryheroes[.]com/), which
immediately goes after veterans with an image from the movie "Flags of our Fathers."

The website is only composed of three links to download a desktop app for free. The app is a fake
installer. Contrary to standard malware installers, this one does not need to be silent, as the user
expects an installation. Here's a look at the user interface, and the error message is always
displayed to suggest something has "stopped" the app from accessing its database.

The progress bar almost ﬁlls up entirely, and then displays an error message:

The installer checks if Google is reachable. If not, the installation stops. If it is reachable, the
installer downloads two binaries from hxxp://199[.]187[.]208[.]75/MyWS.asmx/GetUpdate?

The downloaded binaries are stored in base64. One of the binaries is a tool used to perform a
reconnaissance stage on the system and the second is the Remote Administrative Tool. The RAT
is executed as a service. The installer installs the service ﬁrst (for the -install argument) and then
stops/starts the service with the command and control (C2) server IP in argument:

If something fails during the installation, an email is sent to the attacker. The credentials are
hardcoded in the installer. The email account is ericaclayton2020@gmail[.]com and the error
email is sent to marinaparks108@gmail[.]com.

Reconnaissance phase
The downloaded reconnaissance tool is named "bird.exe" on the system and the internal name is
Liderc. Liderc is a unique supernatural being of Hungarian folklore. The original form of this
creature is a chicken, that would explain the name of the dropped PE on the system, "Bird.exe."
The purpose is to collect a lot of information on the victim machine:

The attacker retrieves information such as the date, time and drivers. The attacker can then see
information on the system, the patch level, the number of processors, the network conﬁguration,
the hardware, ﬁrmware versions, the domain controller, the name of the admin, the list of the
account, etc. This is a signiﬁcant amount of information relating to a machine and makes the
attacker well-prepared to carry out additional attacks. The attacker even gets the size of the
screen by using WMI, which is potentially a trick to identify if the system is a sandbox.
All this information is sent by email by using the same emails:

Remote access tool
This actor also deploys a RAT named "IvizTech" on the system. The code and features are similar
to the ones outlined by Symantec. The IP is put in argument to the service. The attackers hoped
that this would make it impossible to get to the C2, as the installer is needed — you can't just get
there with the RAT itself. This allows an attacker to have a malware that they can add modules
onto (no need to recompile when you want to update the C2). Requiring the installer also could
make it more complicated for researchers to access the C2 and get hands-on analysis of the
malware.
The malware has four features:
kill_me: It stops the service and removes the malware

Upload: It downloads a ﬁle on the internet
Unzip: It uses PowerShell to unzip and execute code on the system
And ﬁnally, the malware can execute a command

Conclusion
This new campaign utilizing the malicious hiring website represents a massive shift for
Tortiseshell. This particular attack vector has the potential to allow a large swath of people to
become victims of this attack. Americans are quick to give back and support the veteran
population. Therefore, it's this website has a high chance of gaining traction on social media
where users could share the link in the hopes of supporting veterans.
At the time of publication, we do not have a method of distribution used, nor do we have proof of
this existing in the wild. The level of sophistication is low as the .NET binary used has poor
OPSEC capabilities, such as hard-coded credentials, but then other more advanced techniques
by making the malware modular and aware that the victim already ran it. There is a possibility that
multiple teams from an APT worked on multiple elements of this malware, as we can see certain
levels of sophistication existing and various levels of victimology.

Coverage
Intrusion prevention systems such as SNORT® provide an effective tool to detect Tortoiseshell
activity due to speciﬁc signatures present at the end of each command. In addition to intrusion
prevention systems, it is advisable to employ endpoint detection and response tools (EDR) such
as Cisco AMP for Endpoints, which gives users the ability to track process invocation and inspect
processes. Try AMP for free here.
Additional ways our customers can detect and block these threats are listed below.
Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) orWeb
Security Appliance (WSA) web scanning
prevents access to malicious websites and
detects malware used in these attacks.
Email Security can block malicious emails
sent by threat actors as part of their
campaign.
Network Security appliances such asNextGeneration Firewall (NGFW), NextGeneration Intrusion Prevention System
(NGIPS), and Meraki MX can detect
malicious activity associated with this threat.
AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security
products.
