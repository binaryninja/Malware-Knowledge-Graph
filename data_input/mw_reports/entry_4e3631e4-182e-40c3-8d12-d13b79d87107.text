APT & Targeted Attacks
We investigated the most recent activities of APT36, also known as Earth Karkaddan, a
politically motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, and discuss its use of
CapraRAT, an Android RAT with clear similarities in design to the group’s favored Windows
malware, Crimson RAT.

APT36, also known as Earth Karkaddan, a politically motivated advanced persistent threat
(APT) group, has historically targeted Indian military and diplomatic resources. This APT
group (also referred to as Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, and Transparent
Tribe) has been known to use social engineering and phishing lures as an entry point, after
which, it deploys the Crimson RAT malware to steal information from its victims.
In late 2021, we saw the group leverage CapraRAT, an Android RAT with clear similarities in
design to the group’s favored Windows malware, Crimson RAT. It is interesting to see the
degree of crossover in terms of function names, commands, and capabilities between the
tools, which we cover in more detail in our technical brief, “Earth Karkaddan APT.”
Our investigation is based on Trend Micro Smart Protection Network (SPN) data gathered
from January 2020 to September 2021.

Looking into one of Earth Karkaddan’s recent campaigns
Typically, Earth Karkaddan’s arrival methods include the use of spear-phishing emails and a
USB worm that would then drop and execute a remote access trojan (RAT).

The malicious emails feature a variety of lures to deceive victims into downloading malware,
including fraudulent government documents, honeytraps showing profiles of attractive
women, and recently, coronavirus-themed information.

Once the victim downloads the malicious macro, it will decrypt an embedded executable
dropper that is hidden inside a text box, which will then be saved to a hardcoded path prior to
it executing in the machine.

Once the executable file is executed, it will proceed to unzip a file named mdkhm.zip and
then execute a Crimson RAT executable named dlrarhsiva.exe.

Earth Karkaddan actors are known to use the Crimson RAT malware in its campaigns to
communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server to download other malware or
exfiltrate data.
Our analysis shows that the Crimson RAT malware is compiled as a .NET binary with
minimal obfuscation. This could indicate that the cybercriminal group behind this campaign is
possibly not well-funded.

minimally obfuscated commands, function names, and variables from a Crimson RAT
malware sample
Crimson RAT can steal credentials from browsers, collect antivirus information, capture
screenshots, and list victim drives, processes, and directories. We have observed how an
infected host communicates with a Crimson RAT C&C server to send exfiltrated information
including PC name, operating system (OS) information, and the location of the Crimson RAT
malware inside the system.

RAT malware sample

ObliqueRat Malware Analysis
Aside from the Crimson RAT malware, the Earth Karkaddan APT group is also known to use
the ObliqueRat malware in its campaigns.
This malware is also commonly distributed in spear-phishing campaigns using social
engineering tactics to lure victims into downloading another malicious document. In one of its
most recent campaigns, the lure used was that of the Centre for Land Warfare Studies
(CLAWS) in New Delhi, India.

document with a link to another malicious document
Once the victim clicks the link, it will download a document laced with a malicious macro.
Upon enabling the macro, it will then download the ObliqueRat malware that is hidden inside
an image file.

Figure 10. The
downloaded "1More-details.doc" contains malicious macros that will download and execute
the ObliqueRat malware in a victim’s machine
The macros inside the file will then download a bitmap image (BMP) file where the
ObliqueRAT malware is hidden, decode the downloaded BMP file, then create a persistence
mechanism by creating a Startup URL which will automatically run the ObliqueRAT malware.

Note that in this specific campaign, both the Crimson RAT malware downloader document
and the ObliqueRat malware downloader share the same download domain, which is
sharingmymedia[.]com. This indicates that both malware types were actively used in Earth
Karkaddan APT campaigns.

and ObliqueRat spear-phishing email attachments that feature the same download domain

CapraRAT, One of Earth Karkaddan’s custom Android RAT
Aside from using spear-phishing emails and a USB worm as arrival vectors, Earth
Karkaddan also uses Android RATs that could be deployed by means of malicious phishing
links. This is not particularly novel for the APT group — in 2018, it used StealthAgent
(detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_SMongo.HRX), an Android spyware that can
intercept phone calls and messages, track victims’ locations, and steal photos. In 2020,
Earth Karkaddan used an updated version of the AhMyth Android RAT to target Indian
military and government personnel via a disguised porn app and a fraudulent national Covid19 tracking app.
We observed this group using another Android RAT — TrendMicro has named this
“CapraRat”— which is possibly a modified version of an open-source RAT called AndroRAT.
While analyzing this android RAT, we saw several similar capabilities to the CrimsonRat
malware that the group usually uses to infect Windows systems.
We have been observing CapraRAT samples since 2017, and one of the first samples we
analyzed (SHA-256:
d9979a41027fe790399edebe5ef8765f61e1eb1a4ee1d11690b4c2a0aa38ae42, detected by
Trend Micro as as AndroidOS_Androrat.HRXD) revealed some interesting things in that year:
they used "com.example.appcode.appcode" as the APK package name and used a possible
public certificate “74bd7b456d9e651fc84446f65041bef1207c408d,” which possibly meant the
sample was used for testing, and they just started to use it for their campaigns during that
year.

The C&C domain android[.]viral91[.]xyz, where the malware was connecting to also shows
that it is very likely that the APT team uses subdomains to host or connect to Android
malware. In previous years, some CrimsonRAT samples were also found to be hosted on the
viral91[.]xyz domain.

Figure 14. CrimsonRAT malware hosted

in viral91[.]xyz
We were also able to source a phishing document, “csd_car_price_list_2017,” that is related
to this domain and has been seen in the wild in 2017. This file name is interesting as “csd” is
likely to be associated to "Canteen Stores Department" in Pakistan, which is operated by the
Pakistani Ministry of Defence. This is a possible lure for the Indian targets to open the
malicious attachment, also used in a similar attack in 2021.
Upon downloading this malicious app that possibly arrived via a malicious link, the user will
need to grant permissions upon installation to allow the RAT access to stored information.
The malware can do the following on a compromised device:
Access the phone number
Launch other apps’ installation packages
Open the camera
Access the microphone and record audio clips
Access the unique identification number
Access location information
Access phone call history
Access contact information
Once the Android RAT is executed, it will attempt to establish a connection to its C&C server,
209[.]127[.]19[.]241[:]10284. We have observed that the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
certificate associated in this deployment, “WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8,” is a common string found
in previously identified Earth Karkaddan C&C servers.

This APK file also has the ability to drop mp4 or APK files from asset directory.

The RAT also has a persistence mechanism that always keeps the app active. It checks
whether the service is still running every minute, and if it is not, the service will be launched
again.

Reducing risks: How to defend against APT attacks
Earth Karkaddan has been stealing information since 2016 by means of creative social
engineering lures and file-stealing malware. Users can adopt the following security best
practices to thwart Earth Karkaddan attacks:
Be careful of opening unsolicited and unexpected emails, especially those that call for
urgency
Watch out for malicious email red flags, which include atypical sender domains and
grammatical and spelling lapses
Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments in emails, especially from unknown
sources
Block threats that arrive via email such as malicious links using hosted email security
and antispam protection
Download apps only from trusted sources
Be wary of the scope of app permissions
Get multilayered mobile security solutions that can protect devices against online
threats, malicious applications, and even data loss
