“A grim outlook”: How cyber surveillance is booming on
a global scale

The increasing overlap between the world’s arms trade and the secretive surveillance
industry risks damaging US national security and will create the potential for even more
abuse unless more accountability is introduced, according to a new study.
The research, from the American think tank the Atlantic Council, offers one of the most
thorough accountings ever assembled of a booming, cross-continental surveillance industry
that makes billions of dollars and yet mostly manages to stay out of the limelight. After years
of rising demand for hacker-for-hire products and an increase in reported abuses by
companies like NSO Group, countries around the world are now trying to deal with this
largely hidden industry.
The report is based on 20 years of data collected from the cyber surveillance trade show ISS
World and arms fairs like France’s Milipol, where hacking is the fastest-growing business
segment alongside more traditional wares like guns and tanks. Its authors examined 224
surveillance companies present at these shows, looked at their marketing material,
examined where in the world they advertised their products, and detailed the known sales of
surveillance and hacking tools.

This US company sold iPhone hacking tools to UAE spies
An American cybersecurity company was behind a 2016 iPhone hack sold to a group of
mercenaries and used by the United Arab Emirates.
They also argue that numerous companies that market internationally, especially to
adversaries of NATO, are “irresponsible proliferators” and deserve more attention from
policymakers.
These companies include Israel’s Cellebrite, which develops phone hacking and forensics
tools, and which sells around the world to countries including the US, Russia, and China.
The company has already faced significant blowback because of, for example, its role during
China’s crackdown in Hong Kong and the discovery that its technology was being used by a
Bangladeshi “death squad.”
“When these firms begin to sell their wares to both NATO members and adversaries,” the
report says, “it should provoke national security concerns by all customers.”
The trade is increasingly global, according to the report, with 75% of companies selling cyber
surveillance and intrusion products outside their own home continent. Lead author Winnona
DeSombre, a fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative, argues that such
sales signal potential problems with oversight.

“There does not seem to be a willingness to self-regulate for a majority of these firms,” she
says.
By marking such firms as “irresponsible proliferators,” DeSombre hopes to encourage
lawmakers around the world to target some companies for greater regulation.
“When these firms begin to sell their wares to both NATO members and adversaries, it
should provoke national security concerns by all customers.”
Governments have recently made moves toward some forms of control. The EU adopted
stricter rules on surveillance tech last year, with the goal of increasing industry transparency.
And within the last month, the US has enacted stricter new licensing rules for selling intrusion
tools. The notorious Israeli spyware company NSO Group was one of several companies
added to a US blacklist because of allegations that spyware it supplied to foreign
governments was then used to maliciously target government officials, journalists,
businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers. NSO has consistently denied
wrongdoing and argued that it strictly investigates abuse and shuts off offending customers.
Nevertheless, one of the report’s authors says it is important to realize the true scale of what
is happening.
“The most basic takeaway from this paper is that we are dealing with an industry,” says
Johann Ole Willers, a fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) Centre
for Cyber Security Studies. “That is a fundamental insight. It’s not enough to target NSO
Group.”

UN warning
United Nations human rights experts recently raised alarms about what they called “growing
use of mercenaries in cyberspace.”
“It is undeniable that cyber-activities have the ability to cause violations both in armed
conflicts and in peacetime, and thus that a whole variety of rights are engaged,” Jelena
Aparac, chair of a United Nations working group on the issue, said in a statement. The group
called on international lawmakers to more effectively regulate the industry in order to protect
“the right to life, economic social rights, freedom of expression, privacy, and the right to selfdetermination.”
One obstacle is that the cyber surveillance industry is rife with obfuscation: shell companies
and resellers are common, and both sellers and buyers use a host of tools to hide their
interactions.
“There is not enough knowledge about the industry in the public, where you can delineate
the irresponsible firms from the responsible,” says DeSombre.

The report points to the recent indictment of former US intelligence personnel who had been
working for the United Arab Emirates as evidence that capabilities first developed by friendly
governments can end up being used for other spying purposes. The hacking tools and
expertise developed by US agencies were then used by the UAE to spy on hundreds of
targets, including Americans.

Use and abuse
The researchers have some suggestions for how governments might learn to understand
and control this growing ecosystem. They recommend enacting stronger “know your
customer” requirements for the industry, so that every seller will better understand how
potential customers might use—or abuse—a hacking tool.

Russia and Ukraine promised to cooperate and help catch the world’s most successful
hackers. But things didn’t quite go to plan.
The researchers argue that NATO countries, which host many prominent cyber surveillance
trade events, should limit the attendance of irresponsible vendors at arms fairs. They also
encourage more international cooperation to rid export laws of loopholes that allow vendors
to evade controls and sell to authoritarian regimes. Finally, they encourage naming and
shaming irresponsible sellers and buyers.

“Our analysis indicates that there exists a significant group of private companies willing to act
irresponsibly: marketing capabilities that carry the risk of becoming tools of oppression for
authoritarian regimes or strategic tools for non–NATO allies,” the report concludes.
Without such actions, it warns, the world faces a “grim outlook”: “a growing number of private
corporations who see few consequences to bolstering the cyber arsenals of major Western
adversaries, only profit.”
