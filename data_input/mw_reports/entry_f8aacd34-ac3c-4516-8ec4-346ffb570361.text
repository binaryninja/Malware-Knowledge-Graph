VBS Script Disguised as PDF File Being Distributed
(Kimsuky)

March 28, 2022

On March 23rd, the ASEC analysis team has discovered APT attacks launched by an attack
group presumed to be Kimsuky, and they targeted certain Korean companies. Upon running
the script file with the VBS extension, the malware runs the innocuous PDF file that exists
internally to trick the user into thinking that they opened an innocuous document file and
uses a malicious DLL file to leak information. Taking PDF file into consideration, it seems the
attacker is targeting precise-refinement industries. See the figure below for details of PDF
file.

Figure 1. Innocuous PDF file used as bait
The team presumes this to be the work of the Kimsuky group due to the following evidence.
Malware is run via ‘regsvr32.exe’ similar to the existing AppleSeed
kro.kr domain, known to be used by Kimsuky, is used as C&C
When relaying attacker’s commands, commands such as tasklist, net user, and
systeminfo are run
The attacker also added ‘.pdf’ in front of the extension to trick users. For many ordinary
users, ‘Hide extensions for known file types’ is enabled by default (see Figure 2), resulting in
the users mistaking the file for a PDF file even though it is a VBS file. Ultimately, when the
user runs the VBS, a malicious activity commences in parallel with the execution of the PDF
file.

Figure 2. Feature of hiding file extension
The malicious VBS creates and runs the innocuous PDF file in the path where the VBS was
run, and Base64-encoded DLL in the path ‘C:\ProgramData’. The filename of the DLL
created by the internal code is random as shown below.
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\tewl8.aqdzkz
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\ltbpq.brv5la
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\ihjq6.xvcdkk
The malicious DLL that is run at the end creates the cmd.exe process and waits for the pipe
communication with the C&C server. The confirmed attacker commands during the standby
are as follows.
systeminfo command
tasklist command
whoami command
net user command
AhnLab is continuously monitoring and responding to such APT attacks, and users must
disable ‘Hide extensions for known file types’ that is enabled by default (see Figure 2) to
prevent being tricked by such a technique.
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, is currently detecting and blocking the files using the
following aliases.
