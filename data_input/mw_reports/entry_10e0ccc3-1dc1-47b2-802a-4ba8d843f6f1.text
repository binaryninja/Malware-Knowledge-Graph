Threat Actors use Google Ads to Deploy VIDAR Stealer
kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-actors-google-ads-deploy-vidar-stealer

Kroll has observed threat actors abusing Google Ads to deploy malware masquerading as
legitimate downloads or software that has been “cracked” or modified to remove or disable
features such as copy protection or adware. As part of our analysis of this trend and threat,
we have identified specifically that VIDAR malware, an information-stealing trojan, is using
Google Ads to advertise spoofed domains and redirect users to fraudulent sites or malware
downloads. Kroll is currently tracking the use of this tactic by ransomware groups globally,
particularly groups that are assessed with medium confidence to be associated with former
Conti ransomware affiliates such as Royal, Black Basta, and Hive ransomware operators.
While the infection vector is the same, Zloader is typically used to deploy further malicious
tooling to gain a foothold within the network during the Intrusion Lifecycle.

As an example of Kroll’s findings and analysis into this trend, we discovered a particular
Google Ad that, while displaying the legitimate domain of the opensource image editing
product GIMP, ultimately redirected the user to a typo-squatted domain, hosting a cloned
website containing malicious downloads. This is particularly interesting as the format of the
advert is controlled through Google’s Ad framework. The display domain highlighted below is
extracted by Google from the target URL provided by the advertiser.

The malicious domain gilimp[.]org appears to have been registered on October 17, 2022,
indicating that this advert could have been live for up to 16 days at the time of our analysis.

At the time of the investigation, it was no longer possible to access the advertisement
(“advert”), and the screenshots available online no longer showed the destination URL of the
advert when hovered over to see the first step in the request chain, making it more difficult
for Kroll to definitively determine exactly how the threat actor achieved this.
Kroll analyzed a binary on the malicious domain that was presented to appear as the GIMP
software. The analysis showed that it was in fact VIDAR malware. Our experts were able to
determine that the malware was stealing browser cookies and passwords, along with
detailed system information, before sending these to a C2 IP address.
The IP information for this IP address shows its geolocation as St. Petersburg in the Russian
Federation.

Most Likely Methodologies
The Kroll Cyber Threat Intelligence team tested a number of theories leveraging the Google
Ad workflow for how “malvertising” could lead to the deployment of the VIDAR Stealer. Kroll
proposed with high confidence the below two most likely scenarios based on completed
research to date:
1. A homoglyph attack utilizing international domain name scheme
2. Via manipulation of the tracking template URL option

Homoglyph Attack

4/11

This attack method is documented by others within the Security and Incident Response
communities and seems to be a favorite hypothesis shared by many to include Kroll’s
researchers.

As detailed in Figure 5, Kroll’s threat intelligence team would be able to set up an advert
utilizing an international domain name that would pass most viewer’s initial inspection of the
domain. If a homoglyph attack was used, it is an exceptionally effective approach with no
obviously out-of-place characters.

Figure 6: Zoomed In View of Ad (Source: Kroll)
Kroll observed that the ultimate page reached by clicking on the link was not an international
domain, but a second, different typo-squatting domain. This inconsistency makes this
method appear less probable since the threat actor would need to link to 2 domains via a
redirect chain.
However, there is a possibility that the threat actor did this to protect their homoglyph domain
or they were aware that some web browsers will show the ascii format domain name in the
address bar (for example: xn--gmp2ub[.]org instead of gïmp[.]org), making the website

appear more suspicious. Kroll's testing of this process also identified Google's automated
domain checking processes which would normally frustrate a threat actor's usage of this
methodology.

Tracking Template URL
Google Ads allow for the use of a tracking link that would be the first link connected too, in
order to store various parameters for your advertising campaign before forwarding on to the
target page. With this tracking link set, the display domain remains the domain of the target
URL.

Google Ads (Source: Kroll)
It is possible that, by using a malicious tracking link, a threat actor could set up an advert for
the legitimate gimp.org and redirect to their malicious page instead of the real page. This is
currently the method Kroll assesses has been leveraged by Threat Actors in prior Intrusion
Lifecycles.
Kroll tested this methodology using a malicious tracking template hosted on a separate
domain and successfully redirected an advert click to a third domain - the video of which can
be viewed here. The setup used the process described in the official Google documentation
for cross-domain redirects.

By utilizing a custom PHP script on the tracking domain, we were then able to redirect traffic
to a proof-of-concept domain instead of the legitimate website. There is some automated
checking performed by Google to detect incorrect redirecting; however, this was
circumvented with minimal effort. It is likely this automated checking is designed to detect
mistakes rather than this specific methodology.

Additional Methodologies
Our team also explored a series of less likely scenarios:
1. A configuration setting within the Google Ads system allowing the ability to specify a
different target domain to display domain either legitimately allowed or via a bug
2. Use of an open redirect on the gimp.org site
3. A bug in URL validation processes allowing for manipulation of display

Configuration Setting
To date, our team have been unable to produce a combination of settings in the Google Ads
interface that would allow a different display domain from the target domain.

Use of Open Redirect
The Google Ads system extracts the domain it displays in the advert from the Final URL
field. If an open redirect were present on the gimp.org website and being used as the Final
URL, “gimp.org” would be displayed. It is not possible to test whether Google Ads would
detect this without an open redirect vulnerability being present to use in the test.

(Source: Kroll)
For this to work, there would have to be an open redirect vulnerability on the gimp.org
website; additionally, the aforementioned redirection validation checks performed by google
would need bypassing.

Validation Bug
It is conceivable that a bug in the validation of inputs might have allowed the manipulation of
the advert and target domain. Our team tried a numerous strategies to see what resulted as
controlled tests. All tests were caught by server-side validation. However, they were
successful in changing the display of the preview advert to not reflect the target domain.

Google Review
As mentioned earlier, Google has a review process for adverts. Changes to the advert,
including changing domain or tracking link will take the advert offline and require further
review.

Impact
Now that this attack has been documented on various websites, it is very likely that other
actors will attempt this technique because it can effectively turn any website into a watering
hole attack, conveniently placing their malicious website at the top of the Google Search
results.
While it is particularly dangerous for sites that provide software for download, it could easily
be expanded for other purposes. For example, a clone of a login page of a legitimate domain
could be hosted for credential harvesting.

Kroll Recommendations
Inform and educate personnel of this current attack methodology, making them aware
of the dangers of downloading executables from websites that have not been verified
as legitimate, particularly in relation to executables found after clicking through any
form of online advertising.
Where possible, restrict staff from downloading executables, a feature of many web
filtering capable proxy servers.
