Each month, the Intel team provides Red Canary customers with an analysis of trending,
emerging, or otherwise important threats that we’ve encountered in confirmed threat
detections, intelligence reporting, and elsewhere over the preceding month. We call this
report our “Intelligence Insights” and plan to share a public version of it with the broader
infosec community from here onward.

Highlights
Rose Flamingo dipped its pink talon into the top 10 confirmed threats we detected in August
2021. Meanwhile, TA551 continues to surge ahead of Cobalt Strike as the most prevalent
threat from the last month—and year-to-date for that matter. We’re also continuing to
observe a trend of adversaries exploiting enterprise applications for initial access, primarily
through vulnerabilities in WebLogic and Confluence over the last few weeks. Last but
certainly not least, “Crypters” are gaining momentum among “as-a-Service” threats and
lowering the barrier of entry for adversaries seeking to install remote access trojans (RAT).
The Red Canary Intelligence team offers insights into these threats—and a glimpse into the
10 most prevalent threats from August—in the latest edition of Intelligence Insights.

2/7

Rose Flamingo is a new activity cluster that we’ve identified emerging over the past several
months. We name new activity clusters when we observe overlap across various detections
that we are unable to successfully associate to any known threats named by the community.
Rose Flamingo’s initial access occurs via file-sharing websites purporting to provide free or
“cracked” software. The ZIP files downloaded from these websites have enticing strings in
their names like free , key , download , license , latest , iso , or crack , and
contain a TXT file with a password for an additional nested ZIP file. The nested ZIP file is
where the trouble really begins, as it contains the initial loader that delivers additional
malicious payloads. We observed a variety of payloads, from coinminers to infostealers and
even a single instance of ransomware. Other researchers from Sophos and BitDefender
have observed activity that overlaps with what we identify as Rose Flamingo, and we plan
to release further details on it in the future as this threat emerges.

TA551 prevails as the most prevalent threat thus far in 2021
TA551, also known as Shathak, is a threat group that uses large-scale phishing campaigns
to deliver additional malware payloads. It continued to surge ahead in prevalence over the
past month, overtaking Cobalt Strike as the most prevalent threat in August as well as 2021
overall. So far this year, nearly 10 percent of all Red Canary customers have encountered a
TA551 detection. BazarBackdoor was TA551’s payload du jour for most of August, though
we were fortunate to catch this threat early enough that we did not encounter any cases of
BazarBackdoor activity last month. Credit for that early intervention goes to those
implementing strong mitigating controls, including restricting access to Office macros and
blocking traffic to new domains. TA551 was also the #1 most prevalent threat Red Canary
observed in 2020, and fortunately the same detection opportunities we shared in our Threat
Detection Report are still effective in catching this threat.

Adversaries continue to exploit enterprise applications for initial
access
In August 2021, Red Canary observed adversaries exploiting vulnerabilities in WebLogic
and Confluence to carry out a variety of follow-on actions in multiple environments. Given
the frequency with which vulnerabilities are disclosed and the ease with which adversaries
can exploit newly reported weaknesses, particularly in common applications, Red Canary
focuses on identifying and detecting the behavior we observe surrounding exploitation of a
vulnerability, and we recommend others take this approach as well. Understanding the
threats we see and the ways in which adversaries operate in compromised networks allows
us all to protect our networks from malicious activity regardless of the means by which the
environment is accessed.
WebLogic

3/7

A handful of attacks we observed last month involved tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP) that overlap with those used by an adversary known as Prophet Spider, a threat
group named by CrowdStrike that is known to compromise vulnerable WebLogic servers
and hand off access to ransomware operators. In campaigns we saw (which were
consistent with CrowdStrike’s excellent reporting), the adversary compromised vulnerable
WebLogic instances, dropped a web shell on victims’ endpoints, and installed various tools.
We also identified behavior consistent with ransomware precursor activity in one instance.

Detection opportunity: Certificate Utility Authority decoding data
This detection opportunity helped us identify Base64-encoded data that was stored in a
.txt file being decoded and written to a .jsp web shell file.
Process = certutil.exe
&
Command_line includes decode

in Command Prompt
Confluence
We also saw adversaries exploit a recently disclosed vulnerability in Confluence (CVE2021-26084) and use a variety of tools in an attempt to mine cryptocurrency from victims.
Activity we observed was consistent with open source reporting on threats exploiting this
vulnerability.

Detection opportunity: Redirected Base64-encoded commands into bash
This Linux detection opportunity helped us identify execution of a Base64-encoded
command that was redirected into bash using brace expansion syntax. This command
initiated the download of z0miner.
Process = bash
&
Command_line includes base64 -d
&
Command_line includes bash

“Crypters” become newest “as-a-Service” threat
In the past few months, we’ve tracked multiple “Crypters-as-a-Service” (CaaS) that facilitate
the delivery of malware through various PowerShell obfuscation methods. The CaaS model
is another addition to the growing market of tools and services geared toward adversaries
with lower technical sophistication. These crypters lower the barrier of entry for RAT
infections, and tracking them helps us more accurately track use of the crypter versus the
RAT.
The first crypter we’ve been tracking is called “HCrypt.” According to our own observations
and public reporting, adversaries using HCrypt typically drop RATs such as ASyncRAT,
Quasar RAT, and LimeRAT. Adversaries leveraging HCrypt have been observed gaining
initial access via phishing attachments, often leveraging image files (IMG or ISO) containing
a script (VBS or JS) that launches HCrypt. The malicious script downloads an additional
script hosted on various publicly accessible sites including archive, cloud hosting, code
repositories, and paste sites. This execution chain ultimately leads to a RAT infection.
Another crypter we’ve been tracking is called “Snip3,” which was first documented in May
2021. It drops similar RATs to those we observed with HCrypt, including AsyncRAT, Agent
Tesla, and Revenge RAT.

Detection opportunity: PowerShell command contains “DownloadString”
This detection opportunity helped us identify HCrypt’s Base64-encoded PowerShell
command to download an additional obfuscated PowerShell script.

5/7

Process = powershell
&
Command_line includes downloadstring

You can test the efficacy of this detection opportunity by running this Atomic Red Team test
from PowerShell.
