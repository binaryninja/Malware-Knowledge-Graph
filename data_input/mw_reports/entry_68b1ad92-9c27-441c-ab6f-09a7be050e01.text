In a fundamental regime that is constantly wary of anything that might jeopardize its
stability, and a region that is a hotbed of political conflicts and dissensions, it is not
surprising to discover a large-scale surveillance campaign that keeps an eye out not only
for external threats, but also for internal ones.
Lately we uncovered an operation dubbed "Domestic Kitten", which uses malicious Android
applications to steal sensitive personal information from its victims: screenshots, messages,
call logs, surrounding voice recordings, and more. This operation managed to remain under
the radar for a long time, as the associated files were not attributed to a known malware
family and were only detected by a handful of security vendors.
Whether it is an application that changes the device's background into ISIS-related images,
or one that impersonates a legitimate Kurdish news agency, the malicious APKs used by
this actor were tailored for the use of specific ethnic groups. Those ethnic groups and
minorities can be considered a natural enemy to the Islamic Republic of Iran: Kurds, ISIS
supporters, Sunni Muslims, and even Iranian citizens.
Our suspicions of the attack's origin were confirmed when we were able to gain access to
logs that were uploaded from the victims' infected devices to the C2 servers. The
information we gathered from those findings also revealed the true dimensions of the attack
as well as its lifespan, with the earliest malicious instances dating back to 2016.
In our presentation, we will discuss the evolution of the mobile spyware, the Iranian
fingerprints it carries, and the political motives behind the launch of such an attack. In
addition, we will share never-before-seen insights into the data stolen from hundreds of
victims.
