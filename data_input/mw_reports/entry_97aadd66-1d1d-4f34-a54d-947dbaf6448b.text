A new ransomware named AVCrypt has been discovered that tries to uninstall existing
security software before it encrypts a computer. Furthermore, as it removes numerous
services, including Windows Update, and provides no contact information, this
ransomware may be a wiper.
After analysis by MalwareHunterTeam, who discovered the ransomware, myself, and
Michael Gillespie, it was decided to name this ransomware AVCrypt as the sample file names
are av2018.exe. The developer, though, may be naming it LOL based on some of the debug
messages found in the ransomware samples.

Debug Messages

Regardless of what it is called, this infection attempts to uninstall software in a way that we
have not seen before. These features are outlined in the sections below.

AVCrypt tries to uninstall your security software
As already stated, when AVCrypt runs it will attempt to remove installed security software
from the victim's computer. It does this in two ways; by specifically targeting Windows
Defender and Malwarebytes and by querying for installed AV software and then attempting
to remove them.

1/9

First AVCrypt will delete Windows services required for the proper operation of
Malwarebytes and Windows Defender. It does this using a command like the following
format:
cmd.exe /C sc config "MBAMService" start= disabled & sc stop "MBAMService" & sc
delete "MBAMService";

It then queries to see what AV software is registered with Windows Security Center and
attempts to delete it via WMIC.
cmd.exe /C wmic product where ( Vendor like "%Emsisoft%" ) call uninstall
/nointeractive & shutdown /a & shutdown /a & shutdown /a;

The above command, though, was not able to uninstall Emsisoft in this manner. It is
unknown if it would work with other AV software.

Wiper or In-dev Ransomware?
At this point, it is not clear whether AVCrypt is an in development ransomware or a wiper as
there are characteristics that can lead to either categorization.
On the wiper side, this ransomware attempts to delete a variety of Windows services when
started. These services are:
MBAMService
MBAMSwissArmy
MBAMChameleon
MBAMWebProtection
MBAMFarflt
ESProtectionDriver
MBAMProtection
Schedule
WPDBusEnum
TermService
SDRSVC
RasMan
PcaSvc
MsMpSvc
SharedAccess
wscsvc
srservice
VSS
swprv
WerSvc
MpsSvc
WinDefend
wuauserv

While Windows will continue to function after these services are deleted, there will likely be
issues in the proper operation of Windows.

2/9

Furthermore, the ransom notes created by the ransomware do not provide any contact
information. They just simply state "lol n".

At the same time, this infection does upload the encryption key to a remote TOR site and the
contents of the note could simply be a placeholder. Furthermore, when executing the
ransomware it displays a alert before it starts and there are numerous debug messages, so it
could very well be just an in development ransomware.
Microsoft has told BleepingComputer that they have only detected two samples of this
ransomware, with of them possibly being my computer, so they feel that this infection is
currently in development. Microsoft is currently detecting it as Ransom:Win32/Pactelung.A.

Already in the wild or just a coincidence?
While I am leaning towards this being an in development ransomware, a security
researcher posted on Twitter that computers at a Japanese university were recently infected
by a ransomware that also uninstalled antivirus software.

BleepingComputer has reached out to the email address listed in the email, but has not heard
back at the time of publication.

AVCrypt Encryption Process
3/9

When AVCrypt is executed it will sit idle for a brief period, extract an embedded TOR client,
and connect to the bxp44w3qwwrmuupc.onion command & control server where it will
transmit the encryption key, timezone, and Windows version of the victim. There appears to
be an error in this transmission, as it appends other content from memory as part of the key.
It will then attempt to remove various security programs as described in the previous
sections. It will then scan for files to encrypt, and when it encrypts a file, will rename it to the
+[original_name]. For example, a file called test.jpg would be encrypted and then renamed
to +test.jpg.

Encrypted Files

In each folder that a file is encrypted, it will also create a ransom note
named +HOW_TO_UNLOCK.txt. This ransom note does not contain any contact
information or instructions as shown below.

4/9

AVCrypt Ransom Note

While running it will also add and delete a variety of registry values in order to reduce the
security of the computer.
The added registry values include:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Associations\LowRiskFileTypes
.cmd;.exe;.bat;
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Windows
%AppData%\
[username].exe
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\HideSCAHealth 1
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run\Windows
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\User.exe
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System\EnableSmartScreen

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard\RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard\LsaCfgFlags

1
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time
Protection\DisableRealtimeMonitoring
1

Some of the changed values include:

5/9

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\Hidden "0"
(old
value="1")
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\ShowInfoTip
"0"
(old value="1")
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\ShowSuperHidden
"0"
(old value="1")
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center\cval

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA
"0"
(old value="1")
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableVirtualization
"0"
(old value="1")

When done, it will execute a batch file named +.bat that performs a cleanup of any dropped
files, clears event logs, terminates the ransomware process, and removes the autorun entry.

Contents of Batch File

As you can see, this ransomware is quite destructive to an infected computer, yet at the same
time does appear to upload the encryption key to a remote server. Therefore, it is not known
whether this is a true ransomware or a wiper disguised as one.

To be fair, if you're using an AV that can be removed with those commands, you should
probably switch anyways.

Hail hell. HOW OUR SAMPLE GOT LEAKED IN FIRST PLACE ?HOW? WE HAD IT
FOR PRESENTATION LIKE DEFCON ARENA. IT WONT BE USED FOR ILLEGAL
PURPOSES.BUT POSTING DETAILED ANALYSIS COULD BE USED TO REPLICATE
BY BAD ACTORS OUT IN WILD.
ANSWER
HOW IN FIRST PLACE BINARY GOT LEAKED WHEN WE NEVER SENT TO
ANYONE EXCEPT OLD PROGRAMMING GUYS ON FORUM THAT ARE VERY
TRUSTED IN FIRST PLACE?
HOW YOU STOLE SAMPLE ? ISNT IT OFFENSIVE ? HOW ?

The same way pretty much all in-dev/unreleased ransomware gets discovered.
If you really are a researcher/analyst, then you should already know what I'm talking
about. If not, then you may want to hold off on your DefCon presentation. ;)

I gotta say I'm very impressed with your article it really goes in depth with this
Ransomware I'm a Network Security student and I love reading about this stuff.
