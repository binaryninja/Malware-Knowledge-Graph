1. Executive Summary
In report " Bvp47 – A Top-tier Backdoor of US NSA Equation Group " (Reference 1), Bvp47 is like a huge
shell or compressed package, containing a total of 18 fragments. Pangu Labs gives attribution analysis
and description of some technical details, such as BPF covert tunneling. However, there are still some
other modules worth in-depth analysis. Those modules can either perform functions together as part of
Bvp47 or be used independently.
In a forensic to Solaris system of one critical infrastructure in 2015, Pangu Lab extracted another sample,
which survived independently on the Solaris platform and seemed to be closely related to Bvp47. After
analyzing the leaked information, we confirmed that the content of the sample file was same to Suctionchar_Agent which was leaked from The Shadow Brokers. When executed with dewdrops, incision and
other modules, it can easily steal password of target system, when user is executing commands like ssh,
passwd, sudo. The file stored stolen passwords in target system also requires private key of RSA algorithm
for decryption.
The process of tracking Bvp47 is more like exploring a puzzle under fog. This report will further illustrate
parts of working method and execution logic of Bvp47, a top-tier backdoor platform, through analysis of
Suctionchar_Agent, Dewdrop, and Bvp47_loader.

2. Attack Scene Restoration of
suctionchar_agent
Attack Scene
After repeated attempts and tracking of the execution process, Pangu Lab roughly restored attack scene
of suctionchar_agent combining with other components, as shown in following figure:

1. The sum module running in the kernel layer will assist suctionchar_agent to steal account passwords
from processes such as PASSWD, TELNET, and SU;
2. The stolen credentials will be synchronized to suctionchar_agent running on Ring3;
3. suctionchar_agent will save the stolen credentials to hidden directory of "/var/tmp/.xxxxxxxx";
4. Attacker remotely sends trigger packet, that runs ish callback, to the BPF filter at the kernel layer;
5. The BPF filter captures the featured packet and transmits it to dewdrop in Ring3;
6. Dewdrop decrypts the data packet to obtain the ish callback command, and forwards it to incision
program;

7. The incision program actively executes callback command to contact C&C server, and the attacker uses
ish to obtain the password file;
8. The attacker decrypts the password file with RSA private key and then obtains stolen passwords

Function Module Design
The file "Linux\etc\opscript.txt" has a description of suctionchar’s function. It steals account and password
in programs such as SSH, TELNET, FTP, PASSWD, SU, RSH, LOGIN, and CSH. The suctionchar_agent
program is just an application layer agent, which communicates with the associated kernel module to
obtain the required information and encrypts it and writes it to a file. The kernel module sum file (not included in The Shadow Brokers Leaks) can be loaded by the modload program. After the kernel module is successfully loaded, the dropped files will be deleted to prevent the content from being restored:

The suctionchar_agent file has a default configuration, and also support external configuration file. The file
formats mainly are XML format of version 3.x and above and the earlier conf format.

obtain the account password and write it to the /var/tmp/ folder, that is, inside the sub_8049EF0 function:

Private Key of suctionchar_decode
As described in the scene, the file "/var/tmp/.e33ff11cb8e3b4ff/a0b973925e397d9acd80e85e2eaa6e60/d
5373a146ff9f200a2376054dde25677" can be decrypted by the "linux\bin\suctionchar_decode" program,
and the encryption algorithm needs to use the RSA private key to decrypt the RC6 symmetric key. file. Like
the private key in Dewdrops, this RSA private key can also support the association between the backdoor
and The Shadow Brokers leaked data package.

6. Conclusion
Although the function implementation of the Suctionchar_Agent module is relatively simple, combining
Bvp47_loader and Dewdrop, we can conclude that Bvp47 has a good architectural capability in design,
and attackers can flexibly combine other functional modules to achieve attack targets and reduce exposed
surface of malicious code as much as possible. Although the NSA-sourced attack activities are highly
secretive, through the analysis of forensic materials within the scope of our own data and the in-depth
mining of open source data, we still hope to complete our puzzle and get a glimpse of the operation methods of the top international hacker teams.
