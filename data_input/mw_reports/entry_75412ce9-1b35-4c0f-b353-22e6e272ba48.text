MITRE ATT&CK

For Raimund Genes (1963-2017)

Security researchers have been consistently sharing threat intelligence on the activities and
malware families deployed by advanced persistent threat (APT) group Earth Aughisky (also
known as Taidoor) for over 10 years. Our monitoring has enabled us to learn and attribute
this APT group’s movements, technical developments, and working relationships with
other cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups. While patterns emerge during incident
responses and analysis, the group’s longevity in cyberespionage has neither wavered nor
become predictable over time. Earth Aughisky remains a formidable threat and continues
to disrupt daily operations of critical businesses, government organizations, and public
services, among others. In recent months, this cyberespionage group has even expanded
operations to target more areas, high-value personnel, and organizations.
In this research, we look at the different malware families and routines previously connected
to Earth Aughisky, as well as our insights on malware that have yet to be attributed to the
group. We also include the overlapping technical details that link these malware families,
as well as the connections of these routines to other APT groups active in cyberespionage
and cybercrime to date. Finally, we analyzed the likely rationale for the recent changes in
activities, targeting, and deployments of this APT group, and the potential implications of
these changes to cybersecurity and real-world events.
Noting the group’s access to a myriad of resources, Earth Aughisky remains a threat and
will likely take advantage of their long history in cyberespionage and cybercrime. The
group’s previous and future potential targets can benefit in constantly learning, adjusting,
and reinforcing their enabled security measures in order to mitigate the risks and damage
that Earth Aughisky can inflict in these turbulent times.

Introduction
While remote access trojan (RAT) Taidoor was disclosed1 over a decade ago, reports2 on advanced
persistent threat (APT) group Earth Aughisky’s campaigns and activities continued3 to surface4 as victim
organizations come clean on operation disruptions. The group constantly updates5 malware routines to
manage security solutions’ developments and remain a formidable threat as the group improves6 its
tactics. In the last decade, Earth Aughisky has deployed a number of associated malware to facilitate their
attacks, noted in their varying levels of sophistication.
The group’s targets7 are primarily entities found in Taiwan,8 with our solutions’ sensors detecting 95%
of their targeted victims located in the country. In recent years, however, we noticed Earth Aughisky’s
activities extending to Japan beginning in late 2017 and 2018.9
Our sensors caught the first activities targeting Japan towards the end of 2017, matching public reports
of observed deployments in 2018. This additional targeting can also be seen to support the organizational
changes discussed in the latter part of this research. Earth Aughisky mostly targets government institutions,
followed by a significant number of enterprise victims10 in critical industries.11

Similar to other APT groups, Earth Aughisky’s cyberespionage activities have been closely monitored and
tracked. The group uses spear phishing as a common means of entry. Once inside their target’s systems,
we observed varied efforts at evading detection, such as abusing legitimate user accounts and functions,
leveraging weak network architecture designs, and deploying later-stage backdoors, to stay for as long
as possible. While some agencies discuss the sensitivities and types of information the group exfiltrates,12
others have kept these details confidential.
Since then, a number of malware families associated with Earth Aughisky have been disclosed or discussed
by different sources, while some have yet to be attributed, documented, or noticed. The following table

Figure 2. Observed malware activity timeline
(Note: Serkdes might have been shared by different cybercriminal groups, detailed in the
Serkdes section)

Each malware serves a different purpose for every Earth Aughisky operation. Some of them are used
for initial intrusion, which are usually bundled with spear phishing emails or exploits, where samples
can be relatively easy to source. On the other hand, some malware families are used to maintain longterm footprints, activated through more sophisticated techniques, and sometimes wrapped with an extra
loader.
Among the backdoors used in later stages, few are hidden more and most of the time can only be
observed in routines deployed to high-value targets. The variations in approaches based on the number
of factors reduce the chance that important operations get disrupted and make important tools less
likely to be disclosed. Our observations showed that among the targets categorized as “Important”
6 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

include industries such as critical infrastructure, government agencies, and military-related organizations.
Meanwhile, “General” targets include vulnerable systems or offices in other industries like the healthcare
sector.

Malware
This section details our analysis for every malware, including their routines and significant characteristics.

Roudan (Taidoor)
Roudan is the classic Earth Aughisky malware that was disclosed over 10 years ago. Over the years,
different formats have been used for callback traffic, which basically contains an encoded MAC address
and some random data. Detailed malware analysis are available in previous reports.

Figure 3. Roudan network traffic, wherein 121212121212 is the encoded MAC address for
010101010101. INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE is sometimes enabled since April 2018

Although the name “Taidoor” has been adopted widely for years, threat actors actually name this malware
“Roudan.” The term can be observed in looking at both backdoor and backdoor builder. A few samples
contain a simplified Chinese version of Roudan, which is “肉弹” or “肉蛋” (although not exactly the same,
“肉弹” has a meaning similar to “cannon fodder”).

8 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 4. Roudan builders

Figure 5. The Roudan project name (Hash: 18c67331716ae672e46583700c4a3eb2abdaa61c), “ziliao,” is
written as “資料,” which simply means “data”

Taleret (Dalgan)
Taleret malware was disclosed in 201320 and has been repeatedly mentioned21 with Roudan/Taidoor in
different reports.22, 23, 24 The malware searches for C&C configurations on public blogs or other repositories
and uses “XXXXX” or “ARTEMIS” as maker to locate the configuration. The configuration can be decrypted
using Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) key “C3 7F 12 A0”.25

9 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 6. Two different types of configurations found on the same blog

Technically, any service that serves configurable content can be abused to host the malware configuration.
From our observations, there are also other web services embedded inside the malware.

Figure 7. A special configuration host setting in Taleret capable of retrieving data from the blog and
C&C server. In this example, Google groups (Hash: f2dfd3910017cd9b3798e9b9dce8ddcace5c6af6)
and Facebook (Hash: 0dfd5669f67a3a992817ca6db096a4cbeadc3257) are abused to host malware
configurations.

10 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

There are two different Taleret implementations. A simpler one uses “XXXXX” as a marker, while another
uses “ARTEMIS” as a marker, which has more accompanying functions.

XXXXX Implementation
Once the backdoor retrieves the actual C&C server, it proceeds to save the configuration to the registry
<Software\Microsoft\SysInternal> in case the configuration is not available next time. The implementation
then calls back to the C&C server with Cookie MCI and MUID.
While MCI contains an encoded MAC address and IP Address with a corresponding logic, MUID is a
random string generated based on CoCreateGuid or GetTickCount.

MAC and IP Address
Original Characters

Encoding Logic

'0'~'9'

<ASCII Code> + 0x18

'A' ~ 'F'

Table 3. MAC and IP address encoding in the MCI

Figure 8. XXXXX implementation traffic

Security teams and analysts can note that some samples drop the special log file at %tmp%\~I.dat, which
contains the execution history.

Figure 9. The ~alot.dat log file

11 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

ARTEMIS Implementation
Studying the ARTEMIS implementation, the traffic contains information similar to MCI and MUID. But
instead of using a Cookie, it sends the information to the C&C server using an HTTPS post. The traffic
starts with “SVc5” followed by a hardcoded “1”, the size of both MCI and MUID feedback information, and
the encoded information itself. Studying the samples, we noticed that after 2015, the header changed to
“SSSS” from “SVc5”, suggesting two different malware protocols in place, but analysis on the feedback
information showed that it remained largely the same.

Figure 10. ARTEMIS implementation traffic before 2015 (top), and after 2015 (bottom)

Although it’s disabled in most samples, this implementation is capable of dropping the log file under
%tmp%\~ah[4 random number].dat, which contains information likely designed for debugging.

Figure 11. The ~ah[four random numbers].dat log file

Serkdes (Yalink)
In 2018, security researchers NTT26 and Macnica27 reported malware Serkdes found in Taidoor-related
incidents. In some versions, Serkdes is capable of loading the configuration from a separate file, sysconf.
dll, via the executable GetPrivateProfileStruct.28

Figure 12. Extra configuration file sysconf.dll (Hash: 4dc73b64f25c96d9bd58f9bc84aa9efa413620ed)

12 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

The malware has a hardcoded version of itself inside used as a mutex. We have identified V1.0, V1.2, V1.3,
V1.5, V1.7, and V2.0 from the samples we have collected. While comparing Serkdes versions with sample
compile time, we found some conflicting details that suggests this backdoor is being used by, and shared
with, different related groups.
There are two batches of V1.0: one was compiled on March 2016, while the other batch was compiled from
November 2017 to June 2018. However, before the 2016 version, there were already a lot of V1.X samples
observed in attacks, and may have been deployed by more than one cybercriminal group. Moreover,
between the 2016 V1.0 and 2017 V1.0, there was V2.0, which was compiled in September 2017.
Another interesting finding is that some Serkdes samples call back to a subdomain under sslvps[.]top,
which is believed29 to be one of APT group DragonOK’s domains. This could indicate that Serkdes is not
exclusively used by only one group in East Asia, and all the groups using the backdoor actively have the
region in their sights as a target.

Buxzop/DropNetClient
DropNetClient was first disclosed in HITCON 2015,30 reportedly found abusing a DropBox API to perform
C&C communication. Later the same year, the malware was reimplemented, with the new version now
called “Buxzop.” As DropNetClient, the malware embeds a DropBox secret to perform C&C communication
and encodes it with a customized algorithm.

13 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 13. Buxzop string decoding

Once activated, the malware creates a folder, /1/001, which serves to store uploaded victim information.

Figure 14. Buxzop callback to create a folder (the actual traffic is in https)

The uploaded information is in the format <<host-name>(<IP>[MAC Address])> such as win-123(0.0.0.0[0001-02-03-04-05]). The information is encrypted with a modified version of RC4, which is basically an
additional extra bit operation before and after the regular RC4 stream.

Figure 15. Buxzop RC4

K4RAT
Looking at the call back traffic of K4RAT, “MP” is the campaign code embedded inside the malware
configuration. “M10” contains MAC address, which is encrypted by RC4 with key “a1 a2 a3 a4”. “M11” is
the IP address with same encryption procedure.

14 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 16. K4RAT callback traffic

LuckDLL
LuckDLL is a relatively new backdoor that became active after 2020. Some samples contain a program
database (.pdb) string <C:\Users\user\Desktop\luckDll\x64\Release\luckDll.pdb> or <C:\Users\user\
Desktop\luckDll\Release\luckDll.pdb>.

Figure 17. LuckDLL pdb string

LuckDLL embeds a public key inside the configuration before communicating with the C&C server. It then
generates a random session key and initialization vector (IV) to encrypt actual traffic.

Figure 18. Public key (top) and session key (bottom)

15 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

During the initial communication, the public key encrypts the session key and IV, and shared with the C&C
server. The hash-like value after parameter api_key is also embedded in the malware configuration, likely
used to identify which private key should be used to decrypt the traffic.

Figure 19. LuckDLL traffic using the shared encrypted session key (while the actual traffic is in HTTPS)

GrubbyRAT
Based on our sensors and observation, GrubbyRAT is a rarely deployed backdoor. The threat actor
only deploys it mostly to important targets, depending on the APT group’s evaluation of the company,
personnel, or industry’s sensitivity level. The malware has a separate configuration file, which is encrypted
with a simple algorithm.
The configuration file is sometimes installed under an existing application folder or general system folders,
and uses a similar file name as the application component. This technique indicates that GrubbyRAT is
installed manually, likely after the actor has investigated the environment and gained an administrative
level of control in the system.
Every time GrubbyRAT tries to read the configuration, it first reads the encrypted file and write the
decrypted configuration to a temporary folder with the prefix 123. The temp configuration then sets the
file time as C:\windows\system32\c_20000.nls and deletes the temporary file after reading.

16 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 20. Decrypted GrubbyRAT configuration

The callback traffic is set in the format <hardcoded 0x33><OSVERSIONINFOEXA result><Is Admin or
not><getsockname result><machine name>.

Figure 21. GrubbyRAT callback information

A random key is generated from GetTickCount and uses it to encrypt the callback information, resulting
in traffic with length 0xee, where the first 0xe is the random key, and the remaining is the encrypted
information.

Figure 22. GrubbyRAT callback’s actual traffic

17 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Kuangdao (KD)
Kuangdao malware was disclosed on 202031 and as far back as 200832 or even earlier, as previous reports
provide detailed malware analysis that can be matched. As reported, there is a special string “KD” in .pdb.

Figure 23. Kuangdao .pdb string

Interestingly, Earth Aughisky previously named the C&C domain using the real malware name. For example,
in certain Roudan samples, the C&C domain is named “roudan[.]serveftp[.]com”. With Kuangdao, we
found a special string in the C&C domain named “kuangd” or “kuangdao” (狂刀, meaning “madness
blade”). This string could be observed in multiple backdoor configurations and matches the .pdb string
“KD”, figuring in how actors named this malware.

Figure 24. The Roudan C&C domain (Hash: a9982fede417d96b0a8604b485c548ad1c5f845b)

Figure 25. The Kuangdao C&C domain

Taikite (SVCMONDR)
The malware was first disclosed in a report33 identifying CVE-2015-2545, using the dropped file name
as malware name “SVCMONDR.” Given the .pdb in some samples and that the malware was mainly
observed in Taiwan, we named this malware “Taikite.” The first C&C callback traffic is encoded in Base64,
with detailed feedback data structure and behavior analysis.

18 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 26. The Taikite .pdb string (Hash: 44673e28e03d642e937eb5d6fed9fc6535e4b872)

Figure 27. Taikite traffic

Specas
This malware family was categorized as Taidoor in an earlier report,34 but is also sometimes identified as
“Taleret.” As other communities have used the name Taleret to identify another malware35 and the protocol
is slightly different than regular Roudan, we will use the name “Specas” to describe this malware in this
report.
On the first C&C callback, it generates a random URL by template “http://%s:%d%s0%u%u” and
“/%c%c%c%c%c.asp?”. Looking at the GET request line, mhbvi is composed simply of five random
characters, with one hardcoded “0” after a question mark. For the remaining numbers on the line
“100287525376”, GetTickCount “287525376” is the derived result. “100” before “287525376” is calculated
as (287525376 & 0X1FF) + 100, which is likely used as the checksum in the traffic.

Figure 28. Specas traffic

The malware also drops a log file at [current module name].xxt, which contains the execution history.

19 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 29. Specas .xxt log

Based on analysis, Specas malware is also capable of reading extra proxy settings from %systemroot%\
system32\sprxx.dll, with the format being <IP>:<Port>.

Figure 30. Specas sprxx.dll proxy setting

SiyBot
SiyBot is a backdoor we observed to be deployed less and only in few instances of an attack. Similar to
Buxzop, SiyBot abuses public services to perform C&C communication. The malware mainly leverages
Gubb and 30 Boxes in its earlier version.

Figure 31. Service API

Like most other malware that abuse public web service, the necessary credential or token can be found
in the malware configuration.

20 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 32. Embedded 30 Boxes credential in the malware

SiyBot supports few basic functions such as chconf, run, download run, and download.

Figure 33. Backdoor command

TWTRAT
TWTRAT is an old backdoor compiled around 2010 based on analysis of the malware binary, first observed
as abusing Twitter direct messages to perform C&C communication. TWTRAT only supports some basic
functions, specifically “down,” “run,” and “downr”; the commands are very similar to SiyBot. Given that
there are new backdoors abusing different public services since the year of compilation and that we have
not observed activities of TWTRAT afterward, this backdoor was only used for a limited period.

Figure 34. TWTRAT invokes direct_message

21 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 35. Twitter account embedded in the malware configuration

GOORAT
GOORAT is a possible precedent to Taleret, observed active around 2009 to 2010 based on the samples
submitted in repositories and analysis of the malware binary. Like Taleret, the malware searches for content
between “XXXXX”, but the content inside is a command rather than a configuration. Most samples were
configured to retrieve data from Google groups, while the rest of the samples we observed would search
for data from different blogs. Eventually, it appears that the group has apparently abandoned this branch
and turned to using Taleret instead.

Figure 36. Embedded site in GOORAT

ASRWEC Downloader
ASRWEC is a downloader capable of searching for the actual payload on blogs or other repositories
that was first disclosed in 201236 and subsequently reported on. This downloader first locates the actual
payload between a special marker, “yxyyyxyy”, with actual decryption procedures documented in detail.
The payload we observed includes both Roudan and SiyBot.

22 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 37. ASRWEC payload found from the blog (the characters after “yxyyyxyy”)

Comeon Downloader
Similar to ASRWEC, Comeon is another type of downloader from Earth Aughisky capable of searching
for payload between *****. We call this Comeon because of the export function name we observed during
analysis. Aside from using a different maker, most Comeon payload were hosted on private servers rather
than a public blog such as 210[.]240[.]26[.]2/java.txt or TheoreticalModel[.]onmypc[.]us/u.txt.
The actual payload could be decrypted by:
1. Skipping the first character
2. Decoding using Base64
3. Decrypting with RC4, using key “A1 A2 A3 A4 A5”
Based on our observations of samples, the payload of Comeon downloader is Roudan, such as the one
hosted on kaiwanxiao[.]pixnet[.]net/blog/post/366093431.

23 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Figure 38. Comeon downloader payload on blog

The malware is capable of dropping the log file at %temp%\iod.zp, with the content likely designed for
debugging purposes.

Figure 39. The iod.zp log file

Illitat Downloader
Illitat was first disclosed on 201237 and again observed in 2015.38 This downloader calls back to fc.asp
using the local environment information it collects such as the machine name and IP address, and then
calls dw.html to download the actual payload. Based on the reports, all the samples’ payloads are Roudan.

Attribution
While some of the listed malware families here were previously documented and attributed to Earth
Aughisky, we list the other malware families we analyzed (that have yet to be reported) in this section to
complete the APT group’s technical profile. We also identify and connect a number of these unreported
malware families based on analysis of the sourced samples over the years, such as similarities in codes,
domains, and naming conventions.

Connections Between Families
We describe the links between the different malware and how our observations have led us to tie them
together as being employed by Earth Aughisky.

Roudan, Specas, Kuangdao, and Buxzop
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has attributed Kuangdao to Earth Aughisky.39
DropNetClient, which shares similarities with Buxzop, has also been attributed to the group. We observed

monitoring these threats.

Taleret and GOORAT
Both malware use “XXXXX” as a marker to locate the information they need. In addition, the same dropper
was used to deliver both GOORAT and Taleret, which functions to decrypt the payload from the resource
and execute it.

revealed that one of them dropped TWTRAT while the other dropped Taleret. Since there is no evidence
that either of the droppers is leveraged by more groups, we believe TWTRAT is also one of Earth Aughisky’s
malware.

Taleret and Buxzop
Earth Aughisky has been using a special loader for several years posing as one of the different system
DLLs such as version.dll or cryptbase.dll. Once activated, it loads an encrypted payload from a separate
file and decrypts it with RC4. Based on the samples we collected, most of the payloads are located at
one of the five files: [Same Folder]\master_patch.dat, master_update.dat, crypt_base.dat, Extensions.xml,
or ipatch.dat.
After loading the payload into the memory, it searches for “MyThread” or “MyBegin” export function and
transfers the control to the in-memory executable. Based on the samples we collected, most payloads
are Taleret and a few instances had Buxzop.

33 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Links to PittyTiger
Airbus Cybersecurity published a report43 on the APT group PittyTiger44 disclosing a detailed analysis of
the threat actor, including Rerol malware (MD5: b6380439ff9ed0c6d45759da0f3b05b8). But researchers
from Mandiant also connected Earth Aughisky to PittyTiger via Roudan.45
According to the disclosure, PittyTiger has been active since 2011 and attacked targets in Europe. Rerol46
was used for initial intrusion and was reportedly capable of downloading a second payload from the
controller. The dropper of Rerol mentioned is a specially crafted dropper widely observed in other Earth
Aughisky attacks. Based on analysis of the sample of the dropper we collected, majority of the payloads
were the different Earth Aughisky malware, but a few of them also noticeably dropped PittyTiger artifacts
(such as Rerol, trojan MMRAT,47 and a decoy document used to deceive victims).

Figure 50. “avstore” Specas sample (Hash: 90ca82604d29a87da95f68aaca7d2b0748b1504b)

Based on these observations, we think that Earth Aughisky and PittyTiger are closely related to each
other.

35 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Origins
Law enforcement agencies49 and other security researchers believe Earth Aughisky and Taidoor malware
originated and operates from China.50, 51, 52 Analyzing samples of the malware have consistently contained
Simplified Chinese and Pinyin among the group’s artifacts.

Figure 51. Roudan builder with Simplified Chinese user interface

During incident response (IR) investigations, we observed different IP addresses get involved in Earth
Aughisky’s activities from the logs. For those we confirmed not using proxies or virtual private networks
(VPNs), most of them were tracked as originating and located in Fuzhou, Fujian. Considering some
connections made between Earth Aughisky and PittyTiger, these observations also match the Airbus
Cybersecurity PittyTiger report described.53

Earth Aughisky has been active for a long time. However, our continuous tracking of the group showed
something interesting that has been happening since 2017. In this section, we describe our observations,
specifically on potential changes in Earth Aughisky as an organization.

Level of Activity
The first landscape change is the noticeable drop of attack incidents in Taiwan. In a nutshell, Earth Aughisky
was active before 2017, but activities significantly dropped during the said year and dropped further after
2019. Meanwhile, other APT groups previously documented as targeting Taiwan also had notable shifts in
targets and activities in Japan and Southeast Asia, pointing to a likelihood of related internal changes in
organization and objectives.54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59

Group Overlap
For the incidents in Japan wherein Serkdes malware was observed and identified, it seems
that there are interesting overlaps between different groups. Certain Upheart samples (Hash:
a7b7a6a9b4aafe2ac1f792c901a21906df3c09adea6549446da1ed72f90b9194)

we

identified,

which was initially reported as belonging to DragonOK based on a report by Macnica,60 were
submitted to a public repository by the same source around the same time a Serkdes sample (Hash:
5888b026ab7df42ed32d53038e9b8541cf272f0010385694e2ba28e0454f14c2) was also uploaded. This
suggests a possibility that both samples are employed in an attack. In addition, as mentioned in Serkdes
section, some Serkdes samples call back to a subdomain under sslvps[.]top, which is also believed to be
one of DragonOK’s domains.
The NTT report presented another overlap with PoshC2, but the evidence was not strong enough to
make the connection. We have never seen Earth Aughisky utilize PoshC2 before. While it might be a
coincidence that they adopted a new open-source tool, other researchers reported that PoshC2 was
adopted61 by DragonOK and BlackTech62 for activities in Japan around the same time. We continue to
monitor and study these instances for better threat intelligence and knowledge on these connections.

38 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Special Roudan Sample
NTT pointed out that they acquired a Roudan sample that seemingly contained only two functions, which
is less than the older samples of the malware. Based on the samples we collected, Roudan seems to
have been developed into a simpler version between 2016 and 2017, potentially indicating a new malware
developer team operating within the group.
In some samples compiled in 2019, the .pdb string C:\Users\user\Desktop\MsgHandleDll0304\Release\
MsgHandleDll.pdb was observed in some samples, which is something that we have not observed in the
last decade.

39 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started

Conclusion
Earth Aughisky has demonstrated a long history in cyberespionage. Since its first disclosure, there have
been continuous reports about its activities for over a decade. Tracking this group and their longevity in
cyber espionage have given security teams and analysts time to gather information and technical data on
their knowledge and skill development as a group, as well as look into the group’s relations and potential
links to other groups and activities.
Examples of these are GOORAT and TWTRAT’s short period of use. Studying a small number of samples
of TWTRAT backdoor and not seeing this malware family used after 2010 suggests that the group’s
exploration of their technical skills had to yet reach maturity. The coding was too complex and contained
unnecessary data that was not required to abuse the services it needed, which was a strong indicator that
the operation and the developers’ skills for malware implementation were still in development.
In GOORAT’s case, the subsequent choice of using Taleret over this earlier backdoor reduced the resources
needed to operate the malware: Taleret hosts the malware configuration on web services, while GOORAT
hosts the command itself. While not an exhaustive list of their development, and even as newer and more
developed security technologies (such as behavior analysis and monitoring) can detect and block these
threats especially in public services, Earth Aughisky choosing Taleret allowed the group to:
•

Change the C&C server being used faster and easier.

•

Avoid in-depth analysis from security teams and researchers.

•

Minimize the coding complexity needed in communicating by web service.

Moreover, while relatively inactive compared to a number of APT groups, studying links such as this group’s
potential connection to PittyTiger allow security practitioners and researchers a general understanding
of APT groups via closer analyses of previous deployments. These groups can be connected to actual
organizations or considered an extension of certain government agencies, and having the background of
these connections allow security teams and (potential) targets to make ample preparations in dealing with
attacks from such threat actors working in tandem or individually.
In addition, the changes from and in the activities of the group can be matched with real-world organizational
changes such as political shifts and transitions. For Earth Aughisky, changes in routines, frequency, or
level of activity, and overlaps in the organization can imply:

•

A change in their focus or objectives, making their target countries, regions, industries, and/or
companies different.

•

A change in their tool arsenal, which means they might begin using malware previously documented
and attributed to other groups and vice versa.

•

A change in their current malware and infrastructure.

Groups such as Earth Aughisky have plenty of resources to develop varied custom tools for their operations
and will likely take advantage of their long cybercriminal and cyberespionage history. After a decade, this
level of consistency and even this observed break from activity can be looked as either a period of respite
from attacks for victims or a period for a higher level of vigilance for when the threat actor decides to
become active again.
