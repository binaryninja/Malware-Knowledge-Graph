The easy decryption method in TorrentLocker has been fixed by the developer. We
have no way of decrypting your files anymore.

Main Startup Window and Ransom Note
TorrentLocker Decrypted

On Aug. 12th 2014, a new sample was sent to me with the victim claiming it to be
CryptoLocker. Upon running and quickly analyzing the exe, I found that it was a new
Encrypting Ransomware (Whats new?). This infection claimed to be Cryptolocker, but also
used the Ransom File Format of Cryptowall. I would guess the reason behind this was to
gain fear in the victim when infected as those 2 Ransomware's are uncrackable. After
running through my normal checks when first getting a Encryption infection sample, I started
my not so normal ones. I made it a unwritten rule to myself that before trying to figure out
hard encryption schemes the infection may use, to always try the easy ones quickly first.
This means testing a encrypted file for MD5, SHA-1, RC2, RC4, XOR, Bit Shift and other
lower encryption schemes first. (I started doing this because of Cryptorbits simple
encryption that I spent far to long on.)

2/6

After going through the list, my jaw about dropped to the floor when I hit XOR. The virus
creator of this infection used a simple (and I mean nothing else) XOR algorithm. I found this
by taking a encrypted file and XOR'ing its bytes with the good files bytes. This produced a file
with a 2MB key buffered with zero's at the bottom. The zeros happen because the infection
only encrypts the first 2MB of files. When taking the 2MB key and XOR'ing it with a different
encrypted file, it was successfully decrypted.
Xor Key Sample File (2MB)

After finding this out, seeing as how it is such a simple mistake, I knew I had to keep it quite
and just build a public application for victims to use without disclosing how it works, as the
virus creator would simply fix the issue. So for the last few weeks I have been spending time
making the decryption application for the victims, but it seems that a few bloggers didn't feel
the same way (Again, Whats new?)
2 days ago Digital-forensics Blog decided that after also finding out this information, to post
it publicly that there was a "mistake on the malware author's part", and continued to describe
in detail what those mistakes were, and also gave the virus creator some pointers! One thing
they did not do though is post a way for any victims to decrypt their files after now alerting
the virus creator that he made a mistake.
Since then the story has circled around and has been posted on multiple blogs, making
almost certain that if the virus creator didn't know, he does by now.
TorrentLocker Details

To go into a little more detail about this infection, When ran it Inject itself into a new instance
of Explorer, Query all Logical Drives, and loop through each drive encrypting each file it finds
that has the below extension and adding .Encrypted to the end.
TorrentLocker Effected Extensions:
*.wb2,*.psd,*.p7c,*.p7b,*.p12,*.pfx,*.pem,*.crt,*.cer,*.der,*.pl,*.py,*.lua,*.css,*.js
journal,*.db,*.cls,*.bdb,*.al,*.adb,*.backupdb,*.bik,*.backup,*.bak,*.bkp,*.moneywell,

The viruses Import table consists of: NTDLL.DLL, SHLWAPI.DLL, WININET.DLL,
CRYPT32.DLL, MAPI32.DLL, KERNEL32.DLL, USER32.DLL, ADVAPI32.DLL,
SHELL32.DLL, OLE32.DLL, and OLEAUT32.DLL. The virus actually uses an open source
Lib to assist in the encryption which is named LibTom. Alot of these bloggers seem to think
that the virus creator used AES or another advance encryption to generate the XOR key, and
simply forgot/ignored to used the key with a advanced encryption before using XOR. Yet, the
code proves otherwise. The author simply uses a 32 byte seed to generate the 2MB key
stream, and its used to XOR the file. Simple as that.
3/6

Example of 32 Byte Seed
File List:
C:\Windows\<Random>.exe - Duplicate infection EXE
*\DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.HTML - Ransomnote (Dropped in any encrypted folder)
%ProgramData%\<Random>\<Random> - Temp file for the infection (No Extension)

Registry List:
HKCU\Software\<Random>\01000000 - Hex of infection
HKCU\Software\<Random>\02000000 - Path to infection exe
HKCU\Software\<Random>\03000000 - UID for infection
HKCU\Software\<Random>\04000000 - HTML Document in hex
HKCU\Software\<Random>\05000000 - Number of infected files

C&C List:

Note: It is also important to mention that this infection will not infect a computer without
contacting its C&C server.

To download TorrentUnlocker, Please use the following link:
TorrentLocker De-Ransomware V1.0.5.0
Once the file has been downloaded, run the TorrentUnlocker.exe program. This will open
the main window seen above, then simply follow the instructions.
If you need any help with TorrentUnlocker please message me, Nathan (DecrypterFixer)
This is V 1.0.5.0 of TorrentUnlocker De-Ransomware. This software will help you decrypt
files that were effected by TorrentLocker. There is a catch though! In order to use this
Decrypter, you must have a Original version of a encrypted file that is at least 2MB. Lets say
I have a image on my DropBox that is untouched by the infection named "Family.jpg" that is
over 2MB, and that I had a copy of it on my local computer when the infection hit. To use this
app, all I would need is that "Family.jpg" and the "Family.jpg.encrypted" on my local
computer.
This application requires .NET 4.0, but has it packaged inside. So if you do not have .Net
4.0, it will install it for you. Even more important is, this application relies on you to give it the
correct files to make the TorrentLocker key. That means if you mess up, it messes up. So it is
ALWAYS recommended to run this application on a folder with copies of your encrypted files
first! Once everything is confirmed to be okay, then you may select your whole drive.
* This application also has step by step guide arrows to help you glide through decrypting
your files with ease. If you ever find yourself confused on what the next step is, Simply look
for the blinking arrow to continue.

A newer version will be coming soon with the following features to help victims more:
Resize ability
Support for files over 4GB
Auto Correct Key detection
Thanks for reading!
