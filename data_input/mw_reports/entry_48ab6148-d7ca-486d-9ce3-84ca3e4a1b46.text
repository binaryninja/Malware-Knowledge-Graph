Virlock is a polymorphic, file-infecting ransomware first discovered in 2014. In 2016 it
demonstrated new capabilities allowing it to spread through shared applications and cloud
storage. When executed, it drops three instances of itself. One instance carries out the file
infection, another locks the machine, and the third creates a persistence mechanism by
registering as a service. Attackers demand bitcoin payment from victims who want their
systems unlocked.
The polymorphic nature of Virlock means every instance is different from a heuristic
perspective, a tactic that effectively bypasses signature-based antivirus (AV) solutions. For
example, Virlock drops three instances of itself during the first stage of its attack, each one
implementing different obfuscation and persistence mechanisms. By varying the
functionality that each instance implements, Virlock guarantees all three instances can
evade a signature-based detection system.

Technical Analysis
Virlock decrypts and runs the original lure file when executing the first time on a noninfected machine. When executing on a previously infected machine it checks to see if a
ransom has been paid. On successfully ransomed machines Virlock will decrypt the host file
but take no further malicious actions. If a machine has not been successfully ransomed
Virlock executes a malicious behavior (Figure 1) without decrypting the host file.

The malicious file was heavily obfuscated and included anti-debugging techniques that
complicated analysis. During our investigation we observed the decoding and launch of the
second stage payload:

The decryption routine uses an incremental xor loop to decrypt the second stage. It checks
to verify that the file has been fully decrypted, then calls the second stage:

Next, the second stage decrypts the data representing the instructions to be executed, in a
virtualized way, by the third stage stub function. Once decrypted, the instructions bytes are
injected into the “execute_opcode” function between RVA 0x1032 and 0x103B as shown in
Figure 4.

Payload Execution
The ransomware drops three instances of itself in three different locations upon execution:

Instance one:
File path: %AllUsersProfile%\<Random_folder_name>\<Random_file_ name>.exe

Instance two:
File path: %UserProfile%\<Random_folder_name>\<Random_file_name>.exe

Instance three:
File path: %AllUsersProfile%\<Random_folder_name>\<Random_file_ name>.exe

Persistence
Virlock modifies the system registry to create persistence on an infected system. It sets two
registry values of two randomly named instances of itself in the “CurrentVersion\Run”
registry key. These settings cause the programs to run each time a user logs on:

Virlock modifies a registry key that specifies which program WinLogon executes when a
user logs on:

The third instance sets a value for a randomly named service:

File Infection
After dropping three instances of itself, Virlock checks for specific file types to infect. Once
the targeted file have been identified, the malware encrypts the file and then replaces it with
a copy of the virus code with the encrypted original file content appended to it.
Targeted File Types:
.exe

.doc

.xls

.pdf

.ppt

.mdb

.zip

.rar

.mp3

.mpg

.wma

.png

.gif

.bmp

.jpg

.jpeg

.psd

.p12

.cer

.crt

.p7b

.pfx

.pem

Virlock appends an .exe file extension to all infected files, then modifies the registry to hide
the file extensions. This is done to trick the user into executing the infected host file:

Here is an example of the Notepad++ executable before and after infection:

Locked Screen
While Virlock is running and executing its file infection routine, its second instance locks the
screen of the victim’s machine. During this process Virlock also shuts down the process
explorer.exe and task manager. It checks the geolocation of the device by searching the
registry and displays a message tailored to the victim’s location. The screen-lock message
asks victims to pay a ransom in bitcoin:

Why Virlock is Important and Why You Should be Concerned
Virlock was first detected in 2014 but made resurgent appearances in 2016 and 2017. With
each reappearance Virlock demonstrated new capabilities, indicating that the malware is
actively developed and updated by cyber criminals. Virlock deploys an impressive tripleinstance attack strategy and a location-specific ransom screen threatening users with fake
legal action should they refuse to comply. With ransomware attacks costing organizations
roughly $13,000 USD per incident, Virlock is a threat that businesses cannot afford to
ignore.

BlackBerry Cylance Stops Virlock
BlackBerry Cylance uses artificial intelligence (AI)-based agents trained for threat detection
on millions of both safe and unsafe files. This lets BlackBerry Cylance spot a threat based
on countless file attributes instead of a specific file signature. Virlock is a polymorphic
threat, capable of modifying its code, but this evasive tactic does not fool our AI-driven
security agents. Our solutions analyze and convict threats based upon millions of threat

features, not specific file signatures. Blackberry Cylance, which offers a predictive
advantage over zero-day threats, is trained on and effective against both new and legacy
cyber threatsattacks.
