John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, Geoffrey S. Berman,
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney Jr.,
Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (“FBI”), announced today that Joshua Adam Schulte was charged in a 13-count
Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment”) in connection with his alleged theft of classified
national defense information from the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) and the
transmission of that material to an organization that purports to publicly disseminate
classified, sensitive, and confidential information (“Organization-1”). The Indictment also
charges Schulte with the receipt, possession, and transportation of child pornography, as
well as criminal copyright infringement. Schulte, who is presently detained on the child
pornography charges, will be arraigned by U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty.

“Leaks of classified information pose a danger to the security of all Americans,” said
Assistant Attorney General Demers. “It adds insult to injury when, as alleged here, the leaks
come from former government officials in whom Americans placed their sacred trust. The
1/3

National Security Division, alongside our partners in the Intelligence Community, will not
waver in our commitment to pursue and hold accountable these officials, and I commend all
those at the Department of Justice and the FBI who have worked diligently to investigate this
matter and bring these charges.”
"Joshua Schulte, a former employee of the CIA, allegedly used his access at the agency to
transmit classified material to an outside organization,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Geoffrey S. Berman. “During the course of this investigation, federal agents also discovered
alleged child pornography in Schulte’s New York City residence. We and our law
enforcement partners are committed to protecting national security information and ensuring
that those trusted to handle it honor their important responsibilities. Unlawful disclosure of
classified intelligence can pose a grave threat to our national security, potentially
endangering the safety of Americans.”
“As alleged, Schulte utterly betrayed this nation and downright violated his victims. As an
employee of the CIA, Schulte took an oath to protect this country, but he blatantly
endangered it by the transmission of Classified Information.” said Assistant Director-inCharge William F. Sweeney, Jr. “To further endanger those around him, Schulte allegedly
received, possessed, and transmitted thousands of child pornographic photos and videos. In
an effort to protect this nation against crimes such as these, the FBI's Counterintelligence
Division in New York will continue to keep our mission at the forefront of our investigations in
protecting the American public."
According to the Indictment, other court filings, and statements made during court
proceedings:
On March 7, 2017, Organization-1 released on the Internet classified national defense
material belonging to the CIA (the “Classified Information”). In 2016, Schulte, who was then
employed by the CIA, stole the Classified Information from a computer network at the CIA
and later transmitted it to Organization-1. Schulte also intentionally caused damage without
authorization to a CIA computer system by granting himself unauthorized access to the
system, deleting records of his activities, and denying others access to the system. Schulte
subsequently made material false statements to FBI agents concerning his conduct at the
CIA.
Schulte was previously arrested on August 24, 2017, on charges relating to his receipt,
possession, and transportation of approximately ten thousand images and videos of child
pornography. In March 2017, members of the FBI had searched Schulte’s residence in New
York, New York, pursuant to a search warrant and recovered, among other things, multiple
computers, servers, and other portable electronic storage devices, including Schulte’s
personal desktop computer (the “Personal Computer”). On the Personal Computer, FBI
agents found an encrypted container (the “Encrypted Container”), which held over 10,000
images and videos of child pornography. The Encrypted Container with the child
pornography files was identified by FBI computer scientists beneath three layers of password
2/3

protection on the Personal Computer. Each layer, including the Encrypted Container, was
unlocked using passwords previously used by Schulte on one of his cellphones. Moreover,
FBI agents identified Internet chat logs in which Schulte and others discussed their receipt
and distribution of child pornography. FBI agents also identified a series of Google searches
conducted by Schulte in which he searched the Internet for child pornography.
Schulte, 29, of New York, New York, is charged with one count each of (i) illegal gathering of
national defense information, (ii) illegal transmission of lawfully possessed national defense
information, (iii) illegal transmission of unlawfully possessed national defense information,
(iv) unauthorized access to a computer to obtain classified information, (v) theft of
Government property, (vi) unauthorized access of a computer to obtain information from a
Department or Agency of the United States, (vii) causing transmission of a harmful computer
program, information, code, or command, (viii) making material false statements to
representatives of the FBI, (ix) obstruction of justice, (x) receipt of child pornography, (xi)
possession of child pornography, (xii) transportation of child pornography, and (xiii) copyright
infringement. A chart containing the charges and maximum penalties is below. The
maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here
for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the
judge.
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative efforts of the FBI.
The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office’s Terrorism and International
Narcotics Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sidhardha Kamaraju and Matthew Laroche are in
charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the
National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.
