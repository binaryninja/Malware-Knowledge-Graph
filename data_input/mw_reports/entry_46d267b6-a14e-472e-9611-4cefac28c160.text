Conclusion

Remaining Tasks
• the Tick Group is a threat actor that has been active in Korea and Japan for the past 10 years !

•Question 1. Are they the same group?
- Existence of Malware Builder

- Same code reused

• Question 2. Connection to Tonto Team
- Some malware are simultaneously used
- Some infrastructures, such as C&C, are shared

- What is the connection between these Groups? - Collaboration? Same Group? Coincidence?

• Necessity of Collaboration
- Collaboration required between the researchers of Korea and Japan, who are experiencing similar active attacks
