XLoader and FakeSpy are two of the most prevalent malware families that emerged from the
mobile threat landscape recently. As of October, there have been a combined total of
384,748 victims from XLoader and FakeSpy attacks globally.

XLoader and FakeSpy are two of the most prevalent malware families that emerged from the
mobile threat landscape recently. We first reported about XLoader in April 2018 when it used
Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing to victimize users with
malicious Android apps that steal PII and financial data and install additional apps.
Meanwhile, we released our findings on FakeSpy in June after it infected Android users via
SMS phishing or SMiShing to launch info-stealing attacks.
As of October, there have been a total of 384,748 victims from XLoader and FakeSpy attacks
globally, with the majority of victims coming from South Korea and Japan.

When we released our initial findings on XLoader and FakeSpy, they appeared to have
nothing to do with each other. However, our new research uncovered clues that could
indicate that they are either being operated by the same threat actor group or that their
operators are affiliated with each other.
XLoader and FakeSpy posed as legitimate apps of a Japanese home delivery service
company
The first clue that led to the discovery of the connection between XLoader and FakeSpy is
when the former was observed disguising as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home
delivery service company in June. Interestingly, almost all FakeSpy variants posed as the
abovementioned Japanese apps to steal sensitive information from users.
Digging deeper into the activities of XLoader and FakeSpy, we learned that they use the
same ecosystem to deploy malware. We used VirusTotal to search for an XLoader sample
(bf0ad39d8a19b9bc385fb629e3227dec4012e1f5a316e8a30c932202624e8e0e) in July and
learned that the sample was downloaded from a malicious domain posing under the name of
the said home delivery service company. When we analyzed a FakeSpy sample
(ba5b85a4dd70b96f4a43bda5eb66e546facc4e3523f78a91fc01c768c6de5c24) over a month
later, we discovered that it was downloaded from the same malicious domain.

Multiple XLoader and FakeSpy samples also showed the same results. As of this writing, we
identified 126 domains that XLoader and FakeSpy shared for deploying malware (see
complete IoC list in the research paper).
In addition, we saw similarities in XLoader and FakeSpy’s methods involving their C&C
addresses. Some of their variants abuse social media user profiles to hide their real C&C
addresses.

active cooperation with vendors that own the involved domains mentioned in this research,
the user profile pages and accounts have been blocked.

with $$. When the app is launched, it will access the page and parse contents to get the real
C&C address.
The Yanbian Gang connection
Analyzing the code structure and behavior of XLoader and FakeSpy, we were able to
correlate the latter’s samples to those of the Yanbian Gang, a Chinese cybercriminal
group infamous for stealing money from account holders of South Korean banks.
Aside from the fact that FakeSpy and Yanbian apps targeted online banking users in Japan
and South Korea, we also learned that both operators used malware with similar code:

Figure 8. The malicious app from the Yanbian Gang (top) and a FakeSpy sample (bottom)
share similar metadata containing the infected devices’ information and C&C server path.
WHOIS results revealed that the registrants of FakeSpy and XLoader's shared malicious
domains (for the fake apps of the Japanese home delivery service company) are from China.
The registrants’ phone numbers also appear to originate from the Jilin Province, which was
known as the Yanbian Gang members’ location.
Considering all information gathered from our research, we can speculate that the Yanbian
Gang has possible connections to FakeSpy and XLoader. However, it could just also mean
that two different sets of threat actors or groups are using the same service or deployment
infrastructure. Nevertheless, the prevalence of XLoader and FakeSpy should remind users to
always follow best practices on mobile security.

and how they evolved over the years, check out our research paper titled “The Evolution of
XLoader and FakeSpy: Two Interconnected Android Malware Families.”
