CISA.gov Services Report

SAP systems running outdated or misconfigured software are exposed to increased risks of
malicious attacks. SAP applications help organizations manage critical business processes
—such as enterprise resource planning, product lifecycle management, customer
relationship management, and supply chain management.
On April 6 2021, security researchers from Onapsis, in coordination with SAP, released an
alert detailing observed threat actor activity and techniques that could lead to full control of
unsecured SAP applications. Impacted organizations could experience:
theft of sensitive data,
financial fraud,
disruption of mission-critical business processes,
ransomware, and
halt of all operations.
