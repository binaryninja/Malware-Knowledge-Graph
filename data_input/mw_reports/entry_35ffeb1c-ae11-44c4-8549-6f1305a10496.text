MoneyTaker: in pursuit of the invisible
group-ib.com/blog/moneytaker

11.12.2017
Group-IB has uncovered a hacker group attacking banks in the USA and Russia
In less than two years, this group has conducted over 20 successful attacks on financial
institutions and legal firms in the USA, UK and Russia. The group has primarily been
targeting card processing systems, including the AWS CBR (Russian Interbank System) and
purportedly SWIFT (US). Given the wide usage of STAR in LATAM, financial institutions in
LATAM could have particular exposure to a potential interest from the MoneyTaker group.

Although the group has been successful at targeting a number of banks in different
countries, to date, they have gone unreported. In addition to banks, the MoneyTaker group
has attacked law firms and also financial software vendors. In total, Group-IB has confirmed
20 companies as MoneyTaker victims, with 16 attacks on US organizations, 3 attacks on
Russian banks and 1 in the UK.
By constantly changing their tools and tactics to bypass antivirus and traditional security
solutions and most importantly carefully eliminating their traces after completing their
operations, the group has largely gone unnoticed.
"MoneyTaker uses publicly available tools, which makes the attribution and investigation
process a non-trivial exercise. In addition, incidents occur in different regions worldwide and
at least one of the US Banks targeted had documents successfully exfiltrated from their
networks, twice. Group-IB specialists expect new thefts in the near future and in order to
reduce this risk, Group-IB would like to contribute our report identifying hacker tools,
techniques as well as indicators of compromise we attribute to MoneyTaker operations".

MoneyTaker attacks: past and future
The first attack in the US that Group-IB attributes to this group was conducted in the spring
of 2016: money was stolen from the bank by gaining access to First Data’s "STAR" network
operator portal. Since that time, the group attacked companies in California, Utah,
Oklahoma, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Florida.
In 2016, Group-IB identified 10 attacks conducted by MoneyTaker; 6 attacks on banks in the
US, 1 attack on a US service provider, 1 attack on a bank in the UK and 2 attacks
on Russian banks. Only one incident involving a Russian bank was promptly identified and
prevented that is known to Group-IB.
In 2017, the number of attacks has remained the same with 8 US banks, 1 law firm and 1
bank in Russia being targeted. The geography, however, has narrowed to only the USA and
Russia.

Connections between incidents
Using the Group-IB Threat Intelligence system, Group-IB researchers have discovered
connections between all 20 incidents throughout 2016 and 2017. Connections were identified
not only in the tools used, but also the distributed infrastructure, one-time-use components in
the attack toolkit of the group and specific withdrawal schemes – using unique accounts for
each transaction. Another distinct feature of this group is that they stick around after the
event, continuing to spy on a number of impacted banks and sending corporate emails and
other documents to Yandex and Mail.ru free email services in the first.last@yandex.com
format.
Important findings that enabled Group-IB to discover the links between crimes include
privilege escalation tools compiled based on codes presented at the Russian cybersecurity
conference ZeroNights 2016. Also, in some incidents, hackers used the infamous Citadel
and Kronos banking Trojans. The latter was used to deliver Point-of-Sale (POS) malware
dubbed ScanPOS.

Connections between incidents
By analyzing the attack infrastructure, Group-IB identified that they group continuously
exfiltrates internal banking documentation to learn about bank operations in preparation for
future attacks. Exfiltrated documents include: admin guides, internal regulations and
instructions, change request forms, transaction logs, etc. A number of incidents with copied
documents that describe how to make transfers through SWIFT are being investigated by
Group-IB. Their contents and geography indicate that banks in Latin America may be
targeted next by MoneyTaker.
Group-IB has provided Europol and Interpol with detailed information about the MoneyTaker
group for further investigative activities as part of our cooperation in fighting cybercrime.
MoneyTaker: arsenal for attacks
Group-IB reports that MoneyTaker uses both borrowed and their own self-written tools. For
example, to spy on bank operators they developed an application with 'screenshot' and
'keylogger' capabilities. This program is designed to capture keystrokes, take screenshots of
the user's desktop and get contents from the clipboard. The application is compiled in Delphi
and contains 5 timers: functions of the application (such as taking screenshots, capturing
keystrokes, disabling itself) are executed once the timer triggers. To circumvent antivirus and
automated sample analysis, hackers again used 'security measures': they implemented the
anti-emulation function in the timer code.

In an attack on a Russian bank through the AWS CBR, hackers used a tool called
MoneyTaker v5.0, which the group has been named after. Each component of this modular
program performs a certain action: searches for payment orders and modifies them, replaces
original payment details with fraudulent ones, and then erases traces. The success of
replacement is due to the fact that at this stage the payment order has not yet been signed,
which will occur after payment details are replaced. In addition to hiding the tracks, the
concealment module again substitutes the fraudulent payment details in a debit advice after
the transaction back with the original ones. This means that the payment order is sent and
accepted for execution with the fraudulent payment details, and the responses come as if the
payment details were the initial ones. This gives cybercriminals extra time to mule funds
before the theft is detected.
Leaving no trace behind
To conduct targeted attacks, MoneyTaker use a distributed infrastructure that is difficult to
track. A unique feature of the infrastructure is a persistence server, which delivers payloads
only to victims with an IP addresses in MoneyTaker's whitelist.
To control the full operation, MoneyTaker uses a Pentest framework Server. On it, the
hackers install a legitimate tool for penetration testing – Metasploit. After successfully
infecting one of the computers and gaining initial access to the system, the attackers perform
reconnaissance of the local network in order to gain domain administrator privileges and
eventually consolidate control over the network. Hackers use Metasploit to conduct all these
activities: network reconnaissance, search for vulnerable applications, exploit vulnerabilities,
escalate systems privileges, and collect information.
The group uses 'fileless' malware only existing in RAM and is destroyed after reboot. To
ensure persistence in the system MoneyTaker relies on PowerShell and VBS scripts - they
are both difficult to detect by antivirus and easy to modify. In some cases, they have made
changes to source code 'on the fly' – during the attack.
After successful infection, they carefully erase malware traces. However, when investigating
an incident in Russia, we managed to discover the initial point of compromise: hackers
penetrated the bank's internal network by gaining access to the home computer of the bank's
system administrator.
In addition, to protect C&C communications from being detected by security teams,
MoneyTaker employs SSL certificates generated using names of well-known brands: Bank of
America, Federal Reserve Bank, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.), instead of filling the fields out
randomly. In the US, they used the LogMeIn Hamachi solution for remote access.
Attacks on card processing

5/6

The first attack on card processing that Group-IB specialists attribute to this group was
conducted in May 2016. Having gained access to the bank network, the attackers
compromised the workstation of First Data's STAR network portal operators, making the
changes required and withdrawing the money. In January 2017, the attack was repeated in
another bank.
The scheme is extremely simple. After taking control over the bank's network, the attackers
checked if they could connect to the card processing system. Following this, they legally
opened or bought cards of the bank whose IT system they had hacked. Money mules –
criminals who withdraw money from ATMs – with previously activated cards went abroad and
waited for the operation to begin. After getting into the card processing system, the attackers
removed or increased cash withdrawal limits for the cards held by the mules. They removed
overdraft limits, which made it possible to overdraw even with debit cards. Using these cards,
the mules withdrew cash from ATMs, one by one. The average loss caused by one attack
was about $500,000 USD.
