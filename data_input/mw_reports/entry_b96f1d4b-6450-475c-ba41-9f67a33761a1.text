Cytrox's Predator Spyware Targeted Android Users with ZeroDay Exploits

Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday pointed fingers at a North Macedonian
spyware developer named Cytrox for developing exploits against five zero-day (aka 0-day) flaws,
four in Chrome and one in Android, to target Android users.
"The 0-day exploits were used alongside n-day exploits as the developers took advantage of the
time difference between when some critical bugs were patched but not flagged as security issues
and when these patches were fully deployed across the Android ecosystem," TAG researchers
Clement Lecigne and Christian Resell said.
Cytrox is alleged to have packaged the exploits and sold them to different government-backed
actors located in Egypt, Armenia, Greece, Madagascar, Côte d'Ivoire, Serbia, Spain, and Indonesia,
who, in turn, weaponized the bugs in at least three different campaigns.
The commercial surveillance company is the maker of Predator, an implant analogous to that of
NSO Group's Pegasus, and is known to have developed tools that enables its clients to penetrate
iOS and Android devices.

In December 2021, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) disclosed that it had acted to remove
roughly 300 accounts on Facebook and Instagram that the company used as part of its compromise
campaigns.
The list of the five exploited zero-day flaws in Chrome and Android is below CVE-2021-37973 - Use-after-free in Portals API
CVE-2021-37976 - Information leak in core
CVE-2021-38000 - Insufficient validation of untrusted input in Intents (root cause analysis)
CVE-2021-38003 - Inappropriate implementation in V8, and
CVE-2021-1048 - Use-after-free in Android kernel (root cause analysis)
According to TAG, all the three campaigns in question commenced with a spear-phishing email that
contained one-time links mimicking URL shortener services that, once clicked, redirected the
targets to a rogue domain that dropped the exploits before taking the victim to an authentic site.
"The campaigns were limited — in each case, we assess the number of targets was in the tens of
users," Lecigne and Resell noted. "If the link was not active, the user was redirected directly to a
legitimate website."
The ultimate goal of the operation, the researchers assessed, was to distribute a malware dubbed
Alien, which acts as a precursor for loading Predator onto infected Android devices.
The "simple" malware, which receives commands from Predator over an inter process
communication (IPC) mechanism, is engineered to record audio, add CA certificates, and hide apps
to evade detection.

The first of the three campaigns took place in August 2021. It used Google Chrome as a jumping off
point on a Samsung Galaxy S21 device to force the browser to load another URL in the Samsung
Internet browser without requiring user interaction by exploiting CVE-2021-38000.
Another intrusion, which occurred a month later and was delivered to an up-to-date Samsung
Galaxy S10, involved an exploit chain using CVE-2021-37973 and CVE-2021-37976 to escape the
Chrome sandbox (not to be confused with Privacy Sandbox), leveraging it to drop a second exploit
to escalate privileges and deploy the backdoor.
The third campaign — a full Android 0-day exploit — was detected in October 2021 on an up-todate Samsung phone running the then latest version of Chrome. It strung together two flaws, CVE2021-38003 and CVE-2021-1048, to escape the sandbox and compromise the system by injecting
malicious code into privileged processes.

Google TAG pointed out that while CVE-2021-1048 was fixed in the Linux kernel in September
2020, it wasn't backported to Android until last year as the fix was not marked as a security issue.
"Attackers are actively looking for and profiting from such slowly-fixed vulnerabilities," the
researchers said.
"Tackling the harmful practices of the commercial surveillance industry will require a robust,
comprehensive approach that includes cooperation among threat intelligence teams, network
defenders, academic researchers and technology platforms."
