Decrypting Bankbot communications.

There's has been an increasing lately in the number of Bankbots found in the wild. The latest
one, was seen on google play masked as a "fun" application. However, it downloaded a
remote payload which contained this Malware.

Bankbot is an Android banking trojan that can be found in underground forums. It can be
downloaded without paying a penny, so it's a choice for many people. This is why we see
increasing numbers, with some variations but maintaining most of the original schema.
Its functionality covers a wide range:
1/3

Get device data
Intercept SMS
Overlay applications
Send stolen data to remote C&C

This looks like a normal setup for an Android banking trojan. However, these communactions
are taking place under an 'encrypted' schema thus not allowing us to see them. We are
releasing a script to decode them given the passwords after a few weeks of testing on
different bankbots thanks to the encryption routine in the server-side. (Can be found at the
end of the post)
The script requires 2 parameters, the first one being the password and the second one being
the payload. Once we get this data, it's easy to retrieve the information.
Say this is our example payload:

And we are given the password mkleotrghyua then we just have to introduce this data in the
script and we will recover the original information.

And this is it! All comms can be decrypted provided you have the password. You can now
get this script HERE! It has another example payload with other key.
