APT Actors Exploiting Newly-Identified Zero Day in
ManageEngine Desktop Central
Summary
Since at least late October 2021, APT actors have been actively exploiting a zero-day, now
identified as CVE-2021-44515, on ManageEngine Desktop Central servers. The APT actors were
observed compromising Desktop Central servers, dropping a webshell that overrides a
legitimate function of Desktop Central, downloading post-exploitation tools, enumerating
domain users and groups, conducting network reconnaissance, attempting lateral movement
and dumping credentials.
CVE-2021-44515, which Zoho rated critical, addresses an authentication bypass vulnerability in
ManageEngine Desktop Central software that can allow an adversary to bypass authentication
and execute arbitrary code on Desktop Central servers.
Zoho released a ManageEngine Desktop Central Security Advisory for the newly identified
vulnerability CVE-2021-44515 on December 3, 2021:

For builds 10.1.2128.0 to 10.1.2137.2, upgrade to 10.1.2137.3

Technical Details
Initial exploitation of a Desktop Central API URL allowed for an unauthenticated file upload of
two different variants of webshells observed in this campaign with the filenames emsaler.zip
(variant 1, late October 2021), eco-inflect.jar (variant 1, mid November 2021) and aaa.zip
(variant 2, late November 2021).
The webshell overrides the legitimate Desktop Central API servlet endpoint,
/fos/statuscheck, and filters inbound GET (webshell variant 2) or POST requests (webshell
variant 1) to that URL path and executes commands as the SYSTEM user with elevated
privileges if the inbound requests pass the filter check.
Initial reconnaissance and domain enumeration was conducted through the webshell. After
initial reconnaissance, the actors use BITSAdmin to download a likely ShadowPad variant
dropper with filename mscoree.dll, and a legitimate Microsoft AppLaunch binary, iop.exe. The
dropper is sideloaded through AppLaunch execution, which creates a persistent service to
execute the AppLaunch binary moving forward. Upon execution, the dropper creates an
instance of svchost and injects code with RAT-like functionality that initiates a connection to a
command and control server.
Follow-on intrusion activity is then conducted through the RAT, including attempted lateral
movement to domain controllers and credential dumping techniques using Mimikatz,
comsvcs.dll LSASS process memory dumping, and a WDigest downgrade attack with subsequent
LSASS dumping through pwdump.
The malicious samples were downloaded from likely compromised ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus servers.

Log File Analysis
1. Search access log files located at

%DesktopCentralInstallRoot%\logs\access_logs\access * for:

a. POST requests to the following URL(s):
i. /STATE_ID/123/agentLogUploader

b. GET or POST requests to the following URL(s):
i. /fos/statuscheck
2. Search serverout log files located at

%DesktopCentralInstallRoot%\logs\serverout\* for log

lines matching a format similar to the following:
a. [<time>]|[<date>]|[com.adventnet.sym.webclien
t.statusu
pdate.AgentLogUploadServlet]|[WARNING]|[<num>
]|[<guid>]: absolute Dir ..\dslogs\1\../../\lib |
b. [<time>]|[<date>]|[com.adventnet.sym.webclien
t.statusu
pdate.AgentLogUploadServlet]|[WARNING]|[<num>
]|[<guid>]: absolute File Name aaa.zip |
i. Also replace aaa.zip with emsaler.zip, ecoinflect.jar or remove it altogether to expand the

search.
NOTE: The /fos/statuscheck API URL is a legitimate Desktop Central function,
but based on analysis appears to be rarely used, and only expects communications
from other internal Desktop Central servers. Any requests between late October
2021 and early December 2021, or those originating from external IP addresses,
should be considered suspicious and investigated.
