Sophisticated Phishing attack targets MetaMask users on Android and iOS
Cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in popularity over the past few years. More people are investing in different
cryptocurrencies than ever before, given how accessible it is in the current market.
Cryptocurrency’s primary appeal is its decentralized, self-governed nature and ease of transaction. Crypto wallets like
Metamask, Coinbase, Binance, and Exodus are the medium of choice for many to manage and transact
cryptocurrency.
As Cryptocurrency is gaining popularity worldwide, it may replace regular currency to some extent in the future.
However, this is not without its downsides. Cryptocurrency also acts as an enabler for phishing, scams, hacking, and
other malicious activities due to its decentralized nature. Figure 1 highlights a few incidences of crypto phishing where
the Threat Actors (TAs) have targeted the Metamask wallet and stolen cryptocurrency.

During our routine Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research, Cyble Research Labs came across certain phishing
sites distributing malware targeting the Metamask application. Metamask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet that
interacts with the Ethereum BlockChain and allows users to access the Ethereum wallet through a web browser or
mobile app.
This particular malware targets both Android and iOS Metamask users and steals seed phrases from the victim’s
device.
A seed phrase is a sequence of words used to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Threat Actors (TAs) can compromise
crypto wallets and steal various cryptocurrencies from the victim’s Metamask account by stealing the seed phrase.
Our analysis indicates that the objective of the malware is to steal cryptocurrency and specifically target users based
out of China. The below image shows the TAs C&C login panel, which stores all the stolen information.

Cyble Research Labs observed that the malicious package is hosted on over ten different phishing sites (details are
shared in the IOCs section below).
We believe that the user could have received a spam SMS or email containing a phishing URL. When users first visit
the phishing URL, they will see a page similar to a legitimate Metamask website, as shown in Figure 3.
The phishing site uses the icon and name of the Metamask wallet in addition to copying the UI of the genuine
Metamask website to trick the user. Figure 3 shows the phishing site and genuine Metamask website, where it is
difficult to distinguish between legitimate and fake websites.

Figure 3 – Phishing vs.

Genuine site
Upon investigating the phishing website, we observed that the TAs had changed the URL of the “Download now”
button, which downloads the malicious package. However, the rest of the controls on the phishing website, such as
features, support, etc., point to the legitimate Metamask site to appear genuine to potential victims.
When users interact with the ‘Download’ button, they are redirected to the download options page, where the user can
download the app for iOS, Chrome, and Android.

Download options for users
If users click on the Chrome download option, they are redirected to the Chrome web store, and they can then
download the genuine Metamask extension. This activity confirms that the Threat Actor only targets iOS and Android
Metamask users.

Redirecting user to Chrome Web Store
When a user clicks on “Install Metamask for iPhone,” it takes them to this phishing site
“hxxps://jpvzhy[.]com/y4BU[.]html“.
The site loads a page with a QR code, which will then download a malicious app targeting iPhone Metamask users.

For Android, the site will download the Android malware file named “matemask.apk,” as shown below.

APK Analysis
While analyzing the downloaded APK file, we observed that the genuine application had been modified with malicious
code to steal the wallet’s seed phrase.

APK Metadata Information
App Name: Metamask
Package Name: io.Metamask

7/14

Upon analyzing the manifest file, we observed that the package name and class name were the same, making the
app appear genuine to potential victims.
We observed a defined launcher activity in the malicious app’s manifest file, extending the react-native class and
loading the “index.Android.bundle” file from assets.

Figure 10 –
Launcher Activity
Once the application is installed, it asks the user to import the wallet using the seed phrase. The app does not accept
random seed phrases. It has a predefined dictionary of words in the js script. If the seed phrase matches the pattern
from the dictionary, it will send the seed phrase to the Command & Control (C&C) server.

Figure 11 – Malicious app asking for Seed Phrase

On analyzing the index file’s JavaScript source code, the method “tryExportSeedPhrase()” is responsible for sending
the seed phrase to the malicious server hosted at “hxxp://39.109.123.213/handler[.]ashx“.

Figure 12 –

Modified malicious JS code
Dynamic analysis confirms that the application sends a seed phrase to the malicious server, as shown below.

Figure 13 –

Sending seed phrase to the malicious server
The seed phrase is used to access crypto wallets.
TAs can thus use the harvested seed phrase to access the wallet and steal cryptocurrency, causing financial loss to
victims.
Since the seed phrase is sent to the attacker’s server using an unsecured HTTP connection, other attackers who are
monitoring the victim’s outgoing network connection can also compromise the wallets.

Conclusion

9/14

According to our research, the fake crypto wallet targets Metamask iOS and Android users. The fake wallet does not
need many Android permissions to steal seed phrases and cryptocurrency. However, the Threat Actor mimicked the
genuine Metamask website extremely closely, making it easier to trick potential victims.
Crypto wallets must strengthen their mobile-first approach and prepare for the challenges posed by this threat by
understanding the security landscape. This can be achieved by implementing a real-time threat-driven mobile security
strategy.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We
recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

How to prevent malware infection?
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App Store.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as PCs,
laptops, and mobile devices.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile device where
possible.
Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Be careful while enabling any permissions.
Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.

How to identify whether you are infected?
Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices.
Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions accordingly.

What to do when you are infected?
Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the Mobile
Data.
Perform a factory reset.
Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.
Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.

What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?
In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.

What should banks do to protect their customers?
Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from malware attacks
via telephone, SMSs, or emails.
