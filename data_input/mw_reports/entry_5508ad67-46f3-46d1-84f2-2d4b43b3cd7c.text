Credit Card-Scraping Kasidet Leads to Detections Spike

By RonJay Caragay, Michael Marcos A commercialized builder of the Kasidet or Neutrino
bot, which is infamous for its distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) capabilities, have been
making the rounds recently after it was leaked in an underground forum in July (version 3.6).
It included a previously unheard of feature for the bot: "ccsearch" or the scraping of payment
card details from point-of-sale (PoS) systems. Further investigation revealed that a paid
version of the builder which included the PoS RAM-scraping feature has been around since
March (version 2.9). Upon looking into the threat landscape following this discovery, we
noticed that the detection count for Kasidet in June increased by 1,288% compared to the
count in May. The spike in June is likely a result of cybercriminals who initially paid for the bot
and used the builder in March even before it was leaked in July. Looking at one of the
samples detected as WORM_KASIDET.SC, we observed that the malware affects PoS
terminals running Windows operating systems. Network shares is one way for the malware
to end up on PoS machines. Beause of this, networks with relatively weak security
measures, such as those used by small and medium businesses (SMBs), are potentially at
risk. Apart from allowing cybercriminals to scan for credit card information and have stolen
data sent over a command-and-control (C&C) server, Kasidet can also launch distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, log keystrokes, copy clipboard data, and capture
screenshots, execute a remote shell, and infect removable drives and network folders.
Detection counts related to Kasidet are highest in Japan (12.75%), followed by United
Kingdom (10.78%), Taiwan (7.84%), and France (6.86%).

Multiple Arrival Vectors The version of the builder leaked in the underground forum
nulled[dot]io was already cracked, thus offering a free tool that cybercriminals can use to
1/3

steal payment card details from PoS systems. The builder and control panel of the latest
version of BKDR_KASIDET.SM, was uploaded by a user nicknamed “0x22.” Copies of the
builder package have been replicated in other hacker forums like hackforums[dot]net and
crimebiz[dot]net.

Apart from the forum, we have also observed this variant using different arrival vectors such
as exploit kits, spammed emails, removable drives, networks, and as payloads of other
Trojans. For example, we found a variant, BKDR_KASIDET.FD, being sent over spammed
messages.

Another variant, WORM_KASIDET.NM, was observed to be delivered as the final payload for
the Sundown exploit kit. Cybercriminals using this worm can use the backdoor command
"ccsearch" to run PoS RAM scraping routines on affected machines. Old Malware, New
Money This is not the first time that memory-scraping capabilities were added into a botnet
tool like Neutrino. PoS-specific features of the FighterPoS code were built on top of malware
that was designed for botnets. However, the upgrade of Kasidet to include memory-scraping
functions is still quite notable. Upgrading old malware to include PoS RAM-scraping
capabilities is a new technique in the threat landscape, but it’s not surprising given how
lucrative stolen payment card data is. It shows that more and more cybercriminals are putting
two and two together to make more money. PoS RAM scrapers are usually sold underground
at a price at par with their lucrative potential and now that cybercriminals have access to a
cracked version of a memory-scraping botnet tool, they can conduct attacks without the
hassle of paying excessively for it. Scoring this tool is basically finding a valuable tool in a
bargain bin and ending up not having to even pay for it. Notable Routines Apart from its
card-scraping capabilities, the malware checks the following to evade detection:
Which virtualization modules (BOCHS, QEMU,VBOX,VMWARE ) are loaded
if a debugger is present
if the system's username and path name is related to a sandbox system
if registries contain virtualization-related keys
and the window class name
Another notable behavior of Kasidet is that its C&C servers return a "404 Not found" error
code, but in fact contain its base-64 encoded commands below the error page.

It can also inject browsers and FTP client servers to monitor network activities. It also checks
registry keys related to Microsoft email clients to gather email credentials. Solutions Trend
Micro protects customers from all threats related to Kasidet. To protect enterprises from bots
and malware with PoS RAM-scraping capabilities, it is best to employ endpoint application
2/3

control or whitelisting technology, included in the Trend Micro Smart Protection Suite, to keep
you in control of the applications that run on your network. Enterprises can also
consider Trend Micro Deep Discovery, which has specialized detection engines and custom
sandboxing that can detect evasive attacker activities like the anti-sandboxing techniques
mentioned in this entry. With additional information by Sylvia Lascano. Updated on
