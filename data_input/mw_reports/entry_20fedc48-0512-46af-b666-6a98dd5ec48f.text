This year, CyCraft has been involved in several cases of Prometheus attacks. Naturally, we
attempted to reverse-engineer Prometheus to gain a better understanding of the attack itself,
the malware, and the attacker. We discovered that it was possible to recover our customers’
encrypted files to some degree. We are sharing this internally developed tool to help other
victims recover.

Quick How-to Guide
1/9

We provided a GUI version for windows users. All features are supported in the GUI version.
If your programming skills aren’t developed to a mature level, please follow the steps below
to decrypt your files:
1. Choose a file or folder to decrypt.
2. Choose the output file name or output folder.
3. Select “Use thread” and fill in 2–4 for PC. (Threads usually make the decryption routine
faster, but it actually depends on the number of your CPU cores)
4. Click decrypt.
5. There is a counter, which shows the current guessing tickcount.
6. The decrypting result will show in the text block below. (There may be multiple possible
keys, so the decryption routine will continue to decrypt to find more possible keys. You
can press “Next one” to skip the current file.)

Brief History on Prometheus
The emerging ransomware group Prometheus made headlines last month with Unit42’s
report. According to the report, which had observed Prometheus for 4 months, victims of the
emerging ransomware group total more than 30 in multiple different countries, including the

United States, the UK, and a dozen more countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and
South America.
Organizations targeted for attack by Prometheus included government agencies, financial
services, manufacturing, logistics, agriculture, healthcare services, insurance agencies,
energy, consulting, law firms, and more.
Although Prometheus claimed to be affiliated with REvil (the Russia-based ransomware
group attributed to the attack on global meat supplier JBS that succeeded in acquiring an 11
million USD ransom, Prometheus’s code and behavior are more similar to Thanos.

Brief History on Thanos — The Possible Predecessor of Prometheus
First observed in 2020, Thanos gained notoriety for its 43 different configuration options as
well as being the first ransomware to utilize the evasion technique know as RIPlace.
RIPlace was introduced via a POC exploit in November 2019. Initially, RIPlace could bypass
several ransomware defense mechanisms, including AV and certain EDR solutions. It wasn’t
until a few months later that RIPlace was seen in the wild.
Like other ransomware on the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) market, Thanos
ransomware does appear to have code overlaps with other ransomware, notably Hakbit;
however, just like other ransomware, Thanos does come with customization options and
appears to still be under active development.

Brute Force Random Seed
3/9

Brute force the random seed of a png image from tickcount 0.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/CyCraft.png.PROM\[prometheushelp@mail.ch\] -o
./output/CyCraft.png -e png -p 16

In this command, there are 4 arguments:
i: input encrypted file
o: output file
e: search file format
p: thread count

Reversed Tickcount
Brute force the random seed of a png image from tickcount 100000 in reversed order.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/CyCraft.png.PROM\[prometheushelp@mail.ch\] -o
./output/CyCraft.png -e png -p 16 -t 100000 -r

There are 2 additional arguments:
t: start from 100000
r: reversed order (100000…0)

Brute force from current tickcount (only for Windows)
Brute force the random seed of a png image from the current tickcount in reversed order.
This feature is usually used in reversed order.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/CyCraft.png.PROM\[prometheushelp@mail.ch\] -o
./output/CyCraft.png -e png -p 16 -c -r

There is an additional argument:
c: start from the current tickcount

Decrypt (Encrypt) with a key
Decrypt (Encrypt) a file with a provided key.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/CyCraft.png.PROM\[prometheushelp@mail.ch\] -o
./output/CyCraft.png -k "+@[%T-mZSh+E[^^i{W:dpwnhdL4<b8D4}]]"

There is an additional argument:
k: provided key

4/9

Brute force random seed with custom format (regular expression)
Brute force the random seed of a text file with a known string “we had another great”.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/test.txt.enc -o ./output/test.txt -p 16 -s "we had
another great"

There is an additional argument:
s: regular expression to match the decrypted file

Brute force the random seed with custom format (bytes pattern)
Brute force the random seed of a png file with its header in hex.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/test.txt.enc -o ./output/test.txt -p 16 -b '89??4e??
0d??1a0a??00'

There is an additional argument:
b: PNG header in hex format.
The full bytes are “8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000”.
We can use ?? to match any byte.
Custom search with bytes pattern is much more convenient than regular expression since
there are lots of file format that it can’t be performed by visible characters.

Brute force the random seed for a directory
Brute force the random seed of a png file with its header in hex.
./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample -o ./output -p 16 -m 1 -f 2

There are two additional arguments:
m: Move backward m minutes from the current decrypted seed when guessing the next
sample. (default 30) Use seed-m*60*1000 as the start tickcount.
f: Found candidate. (default 1)Limit the candidates found. There may be several
candidates to a file, limit its candidates can save time.
Since there are lots of files to decrypt, you can press Ctrl-c to skip the current guessing
file.

Output

5/9

Since we match the file with magic number, it might be matched even if a wrong key is
provided. Therefore, we keep the decryption process continued to guess. You can terminate
it anytime if you find the correct decrypted file.
% ./prometheus_decrypt -i ./sample/test.txt.enc -o ./output/test.txt -p 16 -s "we had
another great" Decrypt file with seed 615750, key: +@[%T-mZSh+E[^^i{W:dpwnhdL4<b8D4,

How it Works
Prometheus ransomware uses salsa20 with a tickcount-based random password for
encryption. The size of the random password is 32 bytes, and every character is a visible
character. Since the password uses tickcount as the key, we can guess it brutally.
