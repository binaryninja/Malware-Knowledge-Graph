Hildegard: TeamTNT’s New Feature-Rich Malware
Targeting Kubernetes
cyware.com/news/hildegard-teamtnts-new-feature-rich-malware-targeting-kubernetes-6587eb45

With consistently improved abilities, TeamTNT has been observed employing a new
malware, Hildegard, which carries stealth and persistence capabilities.

TeamTNT’s new trump card
Palo Alto Networks researchers have observed TeamTNT’s Hildegard malware targeting
Kubernetes systems at its reconnaissance and weaponization stage in January.
The attackers have predominantly leveraged misconfigured kubelet agents to gain
access to the Kubernetes environments for cryptojacking and potentially exfiltrating
sensitive data from tens of thousands of applications running in the clusters.
The Hildegard malware uses a tmate reverse shell and an IRC channel to establish
C&C connections. To disguise the malicious process, it uses a known Linux process
name (bioset).
In addition, for defense evasion, the malware hides malicious processes using library
injection and encrypts the malicious payload inside a binary to make the automated
static analysis more difficult.

Recent attacks
In the last month, the group was using a detection evasion tool named
libprocesshider, copied from open source repositories.

TeamTNT hackers had used malicious shell scripts to exfiltrate Docker API logins,
along with AWS credentials, and deployed cryptocurrency miners.
In another research, Palo Alto researchers found an Ezuri loader in the group’s
recently developed arsenal.
In December, the TeamTNT group was deploying a distributed denial of service
(DDoS) capable IRC bot called TNTbotinger.

Wrapping up
TeamTNT has been continuously expanding its capabilities and arsenal with new tools and
malware. Targeting a Kubernetes cluster can be more profitable than a hijacked Docker
host. With more sophisticated tactics for initial intrusion, execution, defense evasion, and
command and control, the threat actor can be expected to launch a larger-scale attack in
the near future.
