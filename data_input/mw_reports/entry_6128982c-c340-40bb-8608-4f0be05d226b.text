June 30, 2017

The trend towards increasingly sophisticated malware behavior, highlighted by the use of exploits and other
attack vectors, makes older platforms so much more susceptible to ransomware attacks. From June to
November 2017, Windows 7 devices were 3.4 times more likely to encounter ransomware compared to
Windows 10 devices.

ransomware outbreaks in 2017

The Petya ransomware attack on June 27, 2017 (which we analyzed in-depth in this blog) may have been
perceived as an outbreak worse than last month’s WannaCrypt (also known as WannaCry) attack. After all, it
uses the same SMB exploit used by WannaCrypt and adds a second exploit and other lateral movement
methods. However, our telemetry shows a less widespread attack:
The new Petya variant is highly sophisticated malware, but our telemetry shows it had far less reach than
we expected given its worm-like spreading capabilities
The attack started in Ukraine; when the dust settled, more than 70% of the machines that encountered
Petya were in Ukraine
It managed to spread to machines in other countries but in significantly lower volumes
The majority of infections were observed in Windows 7 machines
In this follow-up blog
entry, we’ll discuss
platform protection and
mitigation in Windows 10
and Windows 10 S. The
security configuration and
reduced attack surface of
Windows 10 S block this
attack by default. As we
previously discussed in a
white paper, Windows 10
Creators Update has
next-gen security
technologies that help
defend against
ransomware attacks.
We will also present new
findings from our continued investigation, specifically into the boot sector modification behavior of the
ransomware.

Windows 10 protection and mitigation
The new Petya ransomware combines multiple well-known techniques for propagation and infection that are not
new to security researchers. The noteworthy aspect is that Petya’s developer(s) took techniques normally used
by penetration testers and hackers, and built a sophisticated multi-threaded automation of these techniques
inside a single piece of code.
1/12

Such attacker techniques are part of the modern threat landscape and are continuously researched by security
teams at Microsoft. Resulting new mitigations, hardening or defensive measures are then integrated into our
products and operating systems.
Windows 10 follows this philosophy of continuous mitigation improvements. From our analysis of Petya, we were
able to measure the defenses provided by Windows 10. Summarized in the diagram below are how mitigations
and security features can help disrupt the different stages of this attack.

Petya’s kill-chain diagram with platform defenses able to mitigate or prevent certain techniques in Windows 10
Each mitigation in this diagram is placed on top of the specific malware techniques, which are either fully
prevented or mitigated in Windows 10. For an overview and specific details of these mitigations included in
Windows 10, see this page. Technical details of how each mitigation can help to block Petya’s techniques are
listed below:
Device Guard can enforce strong code integrity policies to allow only trusted signed apps to run. It can thus
block the entry vector of Petya (an updater running an untrusted binary) and also the further propagation
attempts executing an untrusted DLL, either through PSEXEC or WMI.
Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate the LSASS process, so it fully protects from
the credential dump executed by Petya using the external Mimikatz-like tool. It also protects the domain
credentials stored in the Windows Credential Store. Access tokens exposed in memory can still be
leveraged by Petya, but this is a less effective propagation mechanism, and it relies on third-party tools and
other processes active in memory while Petya executes.

2/12

Several exploit mitigations such as better KASLR (randomization of kernel), NX HAL and PAGE POOL
(non-executable kernel regions) are included by default in Windows 10 Anniversary and Creators Update,
and they help mitigate SMB exploits like EternalBlue and EternalRomance. More mitigations like KCFG
(control-flow guard for kernel) and HVCI (kernel code-integrity) are automatically enabled with Device
Guard to provide additional resistance also to new exploits. Previous blogs discuss in detail how such
mitigations were able to help mitigating unknown zero-day exploits, not effective against Windows 10.
UEFI Secure Boot is the security standard that uses hardware features to protect boot process and
firmware against tampering. This protection will stop the dangerous disk encryption executed by Petya with
a bootloader. After Petya’s forced reboot, a machine with Secure Boot will detect the anomalous bootloader
and prevent further execution, containing the damage and preventing the very dangerous encryption of disk
sectors leading to a complete loss of data. A machine in this state will be prevented from booting and can
be recovered with the regular repair functionality from the Windows USB/DVD media. NOTE: Individual files
encrypted by Petya in the limited time before reboot will remain encrypted and must be recovered from
backup copies.
App Locker can also be used to block execution of certain programs (e.g. PSEXEC) or unsigned binaries
(e.g. Petya’s DLL library) for machines that cannot benefit from Device Guard due to lack of the specific
hardware requirements or due to older operating systems not supporting new mitigations (e.g. Windows 7).
Finally, administrators of networks with older operating systems like Windows 7 which do not benefit of modern
hardware and software mitigations, may consider deploying some hardened configurations that could help to
slow down or remove certain lateral movement techniques. Such hardened configurations may impact legitimate
functionality such as file-sharing or remote management and so it needs to be evaluated carefully before
deployment.
Block or restrict access to specific IPs for file-sharing services (SMB)
netsh firewall set service fileandprint
netsh firewall set service RemoteAdmin disable
Block remote execution through PSEXEC
FOR /F “usebackq tokens=2 delims=:” %a IN (`sc.exe sdshow scmanager`) DO sc.exe sdset scmanager D:
(D;;0x00040002;;;NU)%a
ACL remote WMI access

Limited execution time
The impact of Petya’s worm behavior is limited by its design. As part of its execution command, it receives a time
that it can run performing lateral movement and exploitation before rebooting the system.

3/12

If an argument is not passed, a default of 60mins is assumed. This value is later used to determine the time in
the future for the system to reboot.

This means that the threat can only do lateral movement and exploitation of other machines during this limited
time. This reduced the reach of the attack, as observed in our telemetry.
Also, the malware’s worm code does not persist across reboot; for example, if an infected machine is
successfully rebooted, the worm does not run again.

Conditional behavior and boot sector modification
As discussed in our in-depth analysis of the Petya ransomware attack, beyond encrypting files, the ransomware
also attempts to infect the Master Boot Record (MBR).
In addition to modifying the MBR, the malware modifies the second sector of the C: partition by overwriting it with
uninitialized buffer, effectively destroying the Volume Boot Record (VBR) for that partition. The screenshot below
shows the code that makes these changes:

4/12

It is not clear what the purpose of these modifications are, but the code appears to be buggy – it allocates 10
times the amount of memory it requires. In most modern machines, the VBR on the C: partition is not used for
booting as there is a separate partition for the boot manager. Generally, for machines running Windows 7 or later
that weren’t upgraded from XP, the malware’s VBR changes are unlikely to have any impact.
During malware initialization phase, this malware maintains a global variable that dictates its behavior. It alters its
behavior based on the presence of processes related to certain antivirus applications running in the system.

Specifically, it looks for names of processes belonging to Kaspersky Antivirus and Symantec Antivirus and alters
its behavior if it finds them. Below are the CRC values that threat checks and their corresponding process
names.
CRC value

Matching process name

0x651B3005

NS.exe

0x6403527E

ccSvcHst.exe

0x2E214B44

avp.exe

Information controlling threats behavior is stored in a global variable (gConfig in the screenshots), which is then
used to check during MBR modification.
If Kaspersky Antivirus process is found in the system or if the MBR infection is unsuccessful, the malware then
proceeds to destroy the first 10 sectors of the hard drive. The code snippet below shows the threat logic:

Below snapshot shows threat code that destroys 10 sectors of \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0, including the MBR sector.

5/12

On the other hand, if Symantec AV process names are found, the threat does not perform SMB exploitation.

We compared this new ransomware’s MBR infection functionality to the original Petya malware. Here are some
of our findings:
Although the layout of the code and encrypted data in the sectors following the MBR varies between the two
versions, the code itself is functionally very similar. The encryption process is the same: when the malicious MBR
starts, it loads additional code from sectors after the MBR, which in turn proceeds to encrypt the Master File
Table (MFT). After the encryption process is complete, the user is presented with the following ransom message,
which is different from the typical ASCII skull and crossbones shown by the original Petya:

Ransom note from Petya after MBR infection
Interestingly, the first part of the text is the same message used by the WannaCrypt ransomware:

WannaCrypt ransom note
In terms of the malware code itself, there are some differences between the new Petya variant and the original
malware. For example, the malware authors changed the constants for the key expansions of the encryption
algorithm (Salsa20)— the standard string “expand 32-byte k” was replaced with the custom “-1nvalid s3ct-id”.

7/12

The code that is supposed to show the skull and crossbones ransom note is still physically present in the
malicious MBR code, but it is only printing empty lines.
The strategy to cause a reboot to trigger the malicious MBR code has also been updated. The original version
generated a serious system error by calling NtRaiseHardError with code 0xC0000350 (STATUS_HOST_DOWN),
which forced the machine to reboot. The new Petya variant has also added a function to schedule a task that
reboots the machine after a pre-configured number of minutes.

Fake victim ID
Below is the structure of the malware configuration stored by threat at Sector 32 (0x20):
typedef struct
{
BYTE Null;
BYTE SalsaKey[0x20];
BYTE SalsaIV[0x08];
BYTE BitcoinAddress[0x22];
BYTE Empty[0x5E];
BYTE VictimID[0x3C]; // 60 bytes
BYTE Empty2[0x11B];
}
The VictimID shown to the user is randomly generated using CryptGenRandom() and does not correspond to the
MFT encryption, so the ID shown is of no value and is also independent from the per-drive file encryption ID
written on README.TXT.

8/12

Below is a sample disk sector 32 written by the malware. Unlike the original Petya malware, elliptic curve data is
empty.

Boot recovery options
Petya causes some damage to the operating system’s boot code. In certain cases, recovery to boot the infected
machine to a clean state is possible.
Case 1: If machine is equipped with secure boot + UEFI
If an infected machine shows the message below, it means the threat couldn’t hijack the boot process and
encrypt MFT. In this case, booting off a clean installation media and performing Startup Recovery can fix the
issue, and the machine can be booted.

9/12

Case 2: If system is non-UEFI, installed with Kaspersky Antivirus, and in a state where boot completely
fails
The ransomware attempts to destroy the first 10 sectors of the \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0 if Kaspersky Antivirus is found
or if the MBR infection is unsuccessful. Thus, boot process hijack through malicious MBR hasn’t been completed
so the MFT (Master File table) contents are intact and not encrypted by the threat. In this case, the partition table
information is destroyed by the threat. Given that it stores critical information needed in the booting process, a
traditional boot repair process may not work. Rebuilding the partition table may require consultation with an
expert.
Case 3: if a ransom message like below is seen, recovery is not possible

The image is shown if the machine reboots and the malicious MBR is executed successfully. In this case, it is
likely that the malware successfully encrypted the MFT, a vital structure of the NTFS file system. Unfortunately,
recovery is not possible, and the machine is not capable of booting anymore. One can take the hard disk to
another clean system, use disk recovery tools to recover any recoverable personal files, and reimage the system.

Protection against ransomware attacks
The new Petya ransomware variant we saw this week is significantly more complex than the original. It also
improved on WannaCrypt‘s spreading mechanisms by using a second exploit and adding more propagation
methods. These lateral movement capabilities make this ransomware a higher risk for networks with an infected
machine. Furthermore, the boot sector modification behavior discussed in this blog gives this ransomware more
potential to cause damage to machines.
This Petya outbreak exemplifies the ever-increasing sophistication of ransomware attacks. A multi-layer defense
stack is needed to protect computers and networks. At Microsoft, we strive to continuously enhance Windows 10
with next-generation features to protect customers. As described in this blog, Windows 10 has defenses that can
mitigate ransomware attacks like Petya.
Windows Defender Antivirus and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection allows customers to detect,
investigate, and respond to ransomware attacks. For enterprises, Device Guard locks down devices and provide
kernel-level virtualization based security. Credential Guard protects domain credentials stored in the Windows
Credential Store.
