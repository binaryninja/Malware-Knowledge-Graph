New Tekya Ad Fraud Found on Google Play

In late March, researchers from CheckPoint found the Tekya malware family, which was being used to carry
out ad fraud, on Google Play. These apps have since been removed from the store, but we recently found a
variant of this family that had made its way onto Google Play via five malicious apps, although these have
also been removed. (We detect these as AndroidOS_Tekya.HRX.)

Connections between two versions
This variant of Tekya shares many similarities with the previously found version. For example, the encryption
remains essentially identical. The same algorithms and keys are used in both versions.

How this Tekya variant works
The malware registered a receiver that responds to the actions “com.tenjin.RECEIVE” or
“android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED”. The latter action gives the malware the ability to wake after the
device boots:

The functionality of the receiver is implemented in libtenjin.so. Once called, it would then call a method which
hides itself in a common package — specifically, com/google/android/gms/internal/ads/.

Figure 6. Malicious method call
The method called is responsible for downloading a .dex file and loading it. In the case we were analyzing, the
said file would be downloaded twelve hours after the malware was installed. The downloaded file is encrypted;
it is decrypted and loaded by libtenjin.so.

Figure 7. Decryption and loading of decrypted file
Once the downloaded .dex file been loaded, it would attempt to register itself with a configuration server. The
information that is part of the registration includes device ID, user accounts, location, MAC address, and
others (as seen below):
Figure 8. Properties uploaded to the configuration server
If the server did not reject the registration, an encrypted configuration file would be downloaded. This contains
information about the ads to be loaded and control flags. (The blurred text contains information about about
the ad accounts potentially used by the attacker, which we have opted to remove.)

Figure 9. Contents of downloaded configuration file
The malware would do various checks, including time, control flags, and so on based on the downloaded
configuration. If those checks passed, Tekya would hide itself.
Figure 10. Code to hide icon
According to its code, Tekya would target up to 11 advertising networks, including: Admob, Facebook, and
Unity. Advertisements from these networks would be displayed, and user touch events imitated through
InputManager.

Figure 12. Code to inject input event
Tekya would try to trick victims into believing those advertisements were opened by other applications by
changing its icon and label to that of another app on the device.

We originally found several of these apps on Google Play, but Google removed these from the App Store
while our research was underway. We are still watching for any similar threats that may emerge in the wild.

already removed from the Play Store.
