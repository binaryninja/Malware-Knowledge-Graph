Indicators of Compromise Associated with Ragnar Locker
Ransomware
Summary
The FBI first observed Ragnar Locker1 ransomware in April 2020, when unknown
actors used it to encrypt a large corporation’s files for an approximately $11
million ransom and threatened to release 10 TB of sensitive company data. Since
then, Ragnar Locker has been deployed against an increasing list of victims,
including cloud service providers, communication, construction, travel, and
enterprise software companies. The FBI is providing details of Ragnar Locker
ransomware to assist with understanding the code and identifying the activity.
Ragnar Locker actors first obtain access to a victim’s network and perform
reconnaissance to locate network resources, backups, or other sensitive files for
data exfiltration. In the final stage of the attack, actors manually deploy the
ransomware, encrypting the victim’s data.
Technical Details
The Ragnar Locker ransomware family2 is frequently changing obfuscation
techniques to avoid detection and prevention. The Ragnar Locker ransomware is
identified by the extension “.RGNR_<ID>,” where <ID> is a hash of the
computer’s NETBIOS name. Furthermore, the actors, identifying themselves as
“RAGNAR_LOCKER,” leave a .txt ransom note, with instructions on how to pay

Ragnar Locker, also written as RagnarLocker and Ragnar_Locker, has no association with Ragnarok ransomware.
Ransomware family is a group of binaries associated to several ransomwares or actor groups.

the ransom and decrypt the data. Ragnar Locker has used VMProtect, UPX, and
custom packing algorithms. Ragnar Locker has been deployed within an
attacker’s custom Windows XP virtual machine on a target’s site.
Ragnar Locker uses Windows API GetLocaleInfoW to get the infected machine’s
current locale. If the victim’s locale is found to be "Azerbaijani," "Armenian,"
"Belorussian," "Kazakh," "Kyrgyz," "Moldavian," "Tajik," "Russian," "Turkmen,"
"Uzbek," "Ukrainian," or "Georgian," the process will terminate.

The ransomware also checks for current infections to prevent multiple
encryption transforms of the data, potentially corrupting it. The binary gathers
the unique machine GUID, operating system product name, and user name
currently running the process. This data is sent through a custom hashing
algorithm to generate a unique identifier: <HashedMachineGuid><HashedWindowsProductName>-<HashedUser>-<HashedComputerName><HashedAllDataTogether>.
The Ragnar Locker ransomware identifies all attached hard drives, whether
assigned a drive letter or not, using Windows APIs: CreateFileW,
DeviceIoControl, GetLogicalDrives, and SetVolumeMountPointA. The
ransomware assigns a drive letter to any volumes not assigned a logical drive

letter and makes them accessible. These newly attached volumes are later
encrypted during the final stage of the binary.
Ragnar Locker iterates through all running services and terminates services
commonly used by managed service providers to remotely administer networks.
The list of services terminated includes:
vss
veeam

sql
backup

memtas
pulseway

mepocs
logme

sophos
logmein

dfs
mysql

Ragnar Locker also terminates the following running processes:

The malware then attempts to silently delete all Volume Shadow Copies
preventing user recovery of encrypted files, using two different methods:
 >vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet
 >wmic.exe.shadowcopy.delete
Lastly, Ragnar Locker encrypts all available files of interest. Instead of choosing
which files to encrypt, Ragnar Locker chooses which folders it will not encrypt.
Taking this approach allows the computer to continue to operate “normally”
while the malware encrypts files with known and unknown extensions
containing data of value to the victim. For example, if the logical drive being
processed is the C: drive, the malware does not encrypt files in the following
folders:
 Windows
 Mozilla
 Windows.old
 Mozilla Firefox
 Tor browser
 $Recycle.Bin
 Internet Explorer
 ProgramData

 Google
 Opera

 Opera Software

Also, when iterating through files, the malware does not encrypt files with the
following extensions:
 .db
 .msi
 .sys
 .drv
 .dll
 .exe
 .lnk
Recommended Mitigations
 Back-up critical data offline.
 Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive
or storage device. This information should not be accessible from the
compromised network.
 Secure your back-ups and ensure data is not accessible for modification
or deletion from the system where the data resides.
 Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all
hosts.
 Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks.
Consider installing and using a VPN.
 Use multi-factor authentication with strong passwords.
 Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.
