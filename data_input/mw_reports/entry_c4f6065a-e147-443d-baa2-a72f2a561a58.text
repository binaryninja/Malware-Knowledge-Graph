This blog post on Roaming Mantis group is an extract of the “FLINT 2022-037 – Ongoing
Roaming Mantis smishing campaign targeting France” report (SEKOIA.IO Flash
Intelligence) sent to our clients on July 07, 2022.

Summary
On July 4, 2022, a SEKOIA.IO analyst received phishing SMS (also called smishing)
embedding a malicious URL. The URL either deploys the MoqHao Android malware, or
redirects to an Apple login details credential harvesting page. Analysing this smishing activity
led us to identify an active campaign targeting France wide victims.

1/11

Observed modus operandi during the ongoing campaign targeting French mobile phone
users is congruent with past observed Roaming Mantis’ activities documented by multiple
security vendors. The campaigns distributing MoqHao in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,
Germany, France, the UK and the US, have similar techniques. Our investigation shows that
this campaign widely impacts France and possibly results in around 70.000 Android
device compromises.
MoqHao (aka Wroba, XLoader for Android) is an Android Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
with information-stealing and backdoor capabilities that likely spreads via SMS.It is
attributed to Roaming Mantis, assessed to be a financially motivated Chinese threat group.
SEKOIA.IO analysts monitor and track this threat since the beginning of 2022. In this blog
post, we describe each step of the ongoing smishing campaign and share our investigation
on Roaming Mantis’ infrastructure.

Ongoing smishing campaign
The Roaming Mantis smishing campaign was first observed by SEKOIA.IO analysts through
four malicious SMS received on two mobile phones. The distribution campaign shows
geofencing and operating system checking capabilities. We assess that these features allow
Roaming Mantis to tailor their attack, as well as hinder analysis and detection efforts.
Here is an overview of the infection chain depending on the victim’s location (based on their
IP address) and operating system (based on its user-agent).

Step-by-step MoqHao’s compromise
The initial attack vector is a text message distributed by SMS and containing a malicious
URL, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 2. Phishing SMS (translated from French: “Your package has been sent. Please
check it and receive it.”)
If the target clicks on the link, an HTTP request is sent to the server. Depending on the
location of the victim (likely inferred from its IP address), and its operating system (inferred
from the user-agent), the server responds:
Nothing (404 Not found), if the victim’s device is not located in France;
An HTML page containing JavaScript code displaying an alert and redirecting to an
APK (Android Package Kit) file, if the mobile is located in France and runs Android;
A fake Apple login web page, if the mobile is located in France and is an iPhone.
The smishing campaign is therefore geofenced and aims to install Android malware, or
collect Apple iCloud credentials.
If the victim’s mobile phone is running the Android operating system, a message entices the
victim to download the malicious APK as a web browser update (SHA256:
3ba2b1c0352ea9988edeb608abf2c0 37b1f30482bbc05c3ae79265bab7a44c9). This file
corresponds to the MoqHao malware according to the analysis of the Hatching Triage
sandbox.
Once the victim downloaded and executed the malware, the application requests permission
to read and send SMS messages. This permission allows the malware, among other things,
to intercept SMS from victims’ mobile phones. It is worth noting the studied MoqHao sample
mimics the Chrome application to lure the victim to give the permission.

The malware then retrieves its C2 server by requesting one of the social network profiles
stored in the payload. In the analysed sample, the profiles are: shaoye77, shaoye88 and
shaoye99 on Imgur service. In the above Triage analysis, the malware requests the profile
shaoye99 on the legitimate image hosting service Imgur
(hxxps://imgur[.]com/user/shaoye99/about).
As shown in the figure, the “about” section contains the string
“bgfrewiFaRPCdEp9o0GfWPL3dhKU2 uwZh-Z7eg9bgfrewi” which embeds the DESencrypted C2 server contained between the markers “bgfrewi”. By using the following recipe
in CyberChef, we obtain the final IP address and port pair (107.148.243[.]103:28867).

It is worth noting the character “-” is replaced by “+” in URL safe Base64 encoding
representation. Since 2020, the DES key and IV (41 62 35 64 31 51 33 32) are unchanged.

Analysis of the Roaming Mantis campaign
Chinese intrusion set Roaming Mantis is assessed to be a financially motivated group,
with a history of targeting developed countries.
In addition to the received message, several French people are currently reporting this
campaign on Twitter, as well as on French websites dedicated to phishing. As reported by
Kaspersky and Team Cymru in early 2022, and based on our observation of more than

5/11

90.000 unique IP addresses that requested the C2 server distributing MoqHao, we
confirm that the threat group Roaming Mantis currently focuses on France.
This activity leveraging MoqHao or Apple IDs’ credential harvesting pages notably provides
Roaming Mantis access to data from the local system, SD card, applications, messages or
contact list, iCloud backups, iMessage, call history, as well as allowing remote interaction
with a victims’ device.
We assess Roaming Mantis’ wide collection of sensitive data could be further used in
extortion schemes, sold to other threat groups or possibly leveraged in “Big Game Hunting”
operations.

Roaming Mantis infrastructure
We noticed two different infection chains depending on the user-agent of the target. In the
following sections, we describe the infrastructure associated with these attack chains.
Android payloads
The infrastructure hosting Android payloads was detailed by Team Cymru in their part 2
blogpost from April 2022. According to our analysis, this infrastructure still has the same
characteristics:
Servers are used to target only one country, meaning if an IP address from another
country contacts the servers, it will get a 404 error.
The open ports on the servers are still the same:
TCP/443,TCP/5985,TCP/10081andTCP/47001.
The certificate identified in April is still in use on these servers:
SHA1: 834024f91f67445a7fd1a98689cb3f49b4c3ade7
SHA256:
76de629b3e446e99d45541e95da0bfa18db43a48daa23f5551fdbde0c295a36c
Apple phishing
SEKOIA analysts also studied the infrastructure of Apple phishing pages:
Those servers have the following ports open: TCP/80, TCP/5432, TCP/5985 and
TCP/47001.
The landing page mimics the Apple ID login page. As the Android infrastructure, the
geofencing is set and the landing page language matches the language of targeted
users.

Those pages can be tracked on scanning services like urlscan using hashes of subressources requested by the main page such as Card.js file
(6d5516bbbebba2d51878f1e791b642f3b2944270b8e 84770f15a16376b202213).
Domains
Domains used inside SMS messages are either registered with Godaddy or use dynamic dns
services such as duckdns.org. The intrusion set uses more than hundreds subdomains.
Indeed each IP address is resolved by dozens of FQDN (eg: more than 5000 FQDN resolve
to 134[.]119[.]205[.]21). As it is complex to list all domains, SEKOIA rather tracks associated
IP addresses to monitor this intrusion set.
MoqHao C2 server
Roaming Mantis uses a separate infrastructure for the MoqHao C2 servers.
At the time of writing, we were able to identify 9 servers hosted on EHOSTIDC and
VELIANET Autonomous Systems.

All infrastructures are monitored by SEKOIA internal project “SEKOIA C2 Trackers” and can
