Summary
Tofsee is multi-purpose malware that has been in existence for several years, operating
since at least 2013. It features a number of modules that are used to carry out various
activities such as sending spam messages, conducting click fraud, mining cryptocurrency,
and more. Once infected, systems become part of the Tofsee spam botnet and are used to
send large volumes of spam messages in an effort to infect additional systems and increase
the overall size of the botnet under the operator’s control.

Earlier this year, Talos published a blog post discussing how the RIG exploit kit was
delivering this malware to compromised endpoints using malvertising. Malvertising is a
technique commonly used by exploit kits to infect users that browse web sites that are
serving compromised advertisements. This activity seemed to disappear in June, however
Talos has recently observed a marked increase in the volume and velocity of spam email
campaigns containing malicious attachments that are being used to distribute Tofsee.

Tofsee Spam Campaigns
In June 2016, following the disappearance of the Angler exploit kit from the threat
landscape, other major exploit kits began to shift to different payloads. The RIG exploit kit
moved from distributing Tofsee to other payloads, possibly because distributing them was
more attractive to cybercriminals from a monetization standpoint or simply because different
actors began using this exploit kit as a distribution mechanism for their malware.
Given the volume of spam messages that infected hosts attempt to distribute, new nodes
are quickly added to DNS-based Blackhole Lists (DNSBL) and most of the major email
service providers will not accept new message transmissions once this occurs. In order to
keep spam levels consistent new nodes must be added constantly. When RIG stopped
distributing Tofsee payloads, those responsible for Tofsee switched to alternative
distribution methods.
While the Tofsee botnet has been known for sending spam messages, the messages have
historically contained links to adult dating and pharmaceutical websites. Starting in August,
Talos began to observe a change in the nature of the spam messages being sent by this
botnet. The Tofsee spam botnet has begun utilizing malicious attachments that function as
malware downloaders. This activity has increased in velocity and volume.

Initial Infection Vector
The initial infection for this variant of Tofsee appears to be accomplished by convincing
users to open malicious attachments that are delivered via phishing emails. The phishing
emails purport to be from women in Eastern Europe (namely Russia and Ukraine) and the
theme of the emails is adult dating. Each email contains slightly different text, however the
same format is used across all of the messages Talos analyzed. The messages purport to
contain an attached zip archive with pictures of the sender as well as links to a Russian
adult dating website. Here is an example of a Tofsee message body:

The attachment is a zip archive named [Sender First Name]-photos.zip that contains a
Javascript file. In all cases analyzed, the filename of the javascript file is a woman’s first
name. The filename and hash changes across groups of emails with several being sent on
any given day. The code in javascript attachment is obfuscated in an attempt to make
analysis more difficult.

Figure 3: Sample Obfuscated Javascript Downloader
The above Javascript obfuscates a WScript downloader, which is used to retrieve and
execute a malicious PE32 executable from an attacker controlled web server. When
executed, the downloader retrieves a malicious executable and runs it, infecting the system
with Tofsee.

Infection Details
The malware drops a randomly named PE32 executable into the %USERPROFILE%
directory.

Figure 4: Dropped Tofsee Binary
The dropped executable is registered to start whenever the infected user logs onto the
system. This is performed by adding an entry to
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.

It also deletes the initial binary using a batch file that is temporarily stored inside the
%TEMP% directory.

Once infected, systems will begin connecting to various SMTP relays and sending spam
email messages.

Additionally, HTTP GET requests are generated periodically as the malware attempts to
simulate clicking on ads as part of its click fraud routine:

Conclusion
Threats are constantly evolving as attackers change the way in which they attempt to
distribute malware and attack systems. Threat actors also constantly strive to expand their
presence by taking advantage of the ever increasing number of Internet users and devices.
By leveraging our vast visibility into the threat landscape, Talos is able to effectively monitor
these threats and quickly detect changes in the tactics, techniques, and procedures
attackers are using so that we can continually protect our customer’s networks and data.

Coverage
Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.

6/10

Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the
malware used by these threat actors.
CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware
used in these attacks.
The Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect
malicious network activity by threat actors. ESA can block malicious emails sent by threat
actors as part of their campaign.
