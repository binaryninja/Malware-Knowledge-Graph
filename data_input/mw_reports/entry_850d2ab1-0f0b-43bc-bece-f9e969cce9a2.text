Microsoft has warned of an increasing number of consent phishing (aka OAuth phishing)
attacks targeting remote workers during recent months, BleepingComputer has learned.
These attacks were part of two campaigns that ran between September and December
2020, targeting victims in multiple recurring waves.
One of the two attack campaigns specifically targeted Spanish speaking victims with OAuth
links and lures impersonating Mexico's tax administration service — Servicio de
Administración Tributaria (SAT) — on two occasions, in September and October.
The phishing activity of the second spiked multiple times between October and December,
spewing financial lures targeting organizations' "investment teams."

Threat actors behind these attacks abused cloud service providers or used
previously compromised domains to deliver their phishing emails. The OAuth URLs
redirected the potential victims to attacker-owned domains for displaying the authentication
request.
Microsoft issued this warning in a private security advisory shared with Microsoft Defender
ATP subscribers in late-January.

What is consent phishing?
Consent phishing (also known as OAuth phishing) is an application-based attack
variant where the attackers attempt to trick targets into providing malicious Office 365
OAuth apps (web apps registered by the attackers with an OAuth 2.0 provider) with access
to their Office 365 accounts.
Once victims grant the malicious apps permissions to their account's data, the threat actors
pounce on their access and refresh tokens.
They enable them to take over the targets' Microsoft accounts and make API calls through
the attacker-controlled malicious Office 365 OAuth app.
The compromised Office 365 accounts provide the attackers with access to victims' emails,
files, contacts, as well as sensitive information and resources stored on corporate
SharePoint document management/storage systems and/or OneDrive for Business cloud
storage spaces.
"Once victims clicked on the deceptive links, they were ultimately prompted to grant access
permissions to a malicious web application (web app)," Microsoft Corporate Vice President
for Customer Security & Trust Tom Burt explained.

"Unknown to the victim, these malicious web apps were controlled by the criminals, who,
with fraudulently obtained permission, could access the victim’s Microsoft Office 365
account."
BleepingComputer reported on the inner-workings of a consent phishing attack in
December 2019, showing how it makes it possible for attackers to hijack Office 365
accounts.

Consent phishing warnings
Microsoft warned of phishers' shift to new types of phishing tactics such as consent
phishing in July 2020, adding to other, more conventional phishing vectors such as email
phishing and credential theft attacks.
At the time, multiple phishing campaigns were launching consent phishing attacks against
Microsoft customers trying to take control of their accounts, stealing sensitive data, and
later using them to defraud organizations in Business Email Compromise (BEC) fraud
schemes.
Microsoft took legal action and dismantled part of the attack infrastructure by taking down
six of the domains used to host malicious 365 OAuth apps used to hijack customers' Office
365 accounts.
Additionally, the company identified and disabled malicious Office 365 OAuth apps to block
users from accessing them and getting their accounts hijacked.

Starting with October 2020, Microsoft announced that Office 365 consent phishing
protections are generally available, including app consent policies and OAuth app publisher
verification.
Last year, the FBI also warned of BEC scammers abusing cloud email services such
as Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite in Private Industry Notifications published
in March and in April.

Defense measures
Microsoft customers can check if they have any user consent apps or services tied to their
accounts by going to their account's consent manager dashboard.
To remove any of the listed consents, you have to click on its entry and, on the page that
opens, click on the 'Remove these permissions' button to remove it.

Organizations can also take measures to protect their remote workforce from OAuth
phishing by requiring the use of publisher verified apps, educating employees on how to
spot consent phishing tactics, and only allow access to OAuth apps trusted by the
organization or provided by verified publishers.
Employers can also educate workers on how Microsoft permissions and the consent
framework work:
• Understand the data and permissions an application is asking for and understand how
permissions and consent work within our platform.
• Ensure administrators know how to manage and evaluate consent requests.
• Audit apps and consented permissions in your organization to ensure applications being
used are accessing only the data they need and adhering to the principles of least privilege.
More details on how to defend against security threats can be found in Microsoft's Detect
and Remediate Illicit Consent Grants in Office 365 and Five steps to securing your identity
infrastructure support docs.
