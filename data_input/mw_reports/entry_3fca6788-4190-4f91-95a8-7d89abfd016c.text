The crisis in Ukraine has already proven to be a catalyst for additional aggressive cyber
activity that will likely increase as the situation deteriorates. At Mandiant, we have been
anticipating this activity, and we are concerned that, unlike the recent defacements and
destructive attacks, future activity will not be restricted to Ukrainian targets or the public
sector.

The Scope of Activity
Russia and its allies will conduct cyber espionage, information operations, and disruptive
cyber attacks during this crisis. Though cyber espionage is already a regular facet of global
activity, as the situation deteriorates, we are likely to see more aggressive information
operations and disruptive cyber attacks within and outside of Ukraine.
Russian cyber espionage actors such as UNC2452, Turla, and APT28, which are tied
to the Russian intelligence services, have almost certainly already received tasking to
provide intelligence around the crisis. These actors already frequently target
government, military, diplomatic, and related targets worldwide for intelligence that
benefits Russia’s foreign policy decision making.
Russia leverages a multitude of additional cyber espionage operators within the region,
such as TEMP.Armageddon (UNC530), actors who operate out of occupied Crimea
and Eastern Ukraine.
Information operations, such as those involving the creation and dissemination of
fabricated content and social media manipulation to promote desired narratives, are
already happening within the context of the crisis. We continue to see pro-Russia
actors, and those promoting narratives aligned with Russian interests, regularly
conduct information operations against NATO allies and partners within Eastern
Europe.
Notably, a Ukrainian official has attributed recent defacements of Ukrainian government
websites to UNC1151 (an actor we have linked to Belarus), though we cannot confirm
this attribution. We have previously observed similar activity conducted by GRU-related
actors Sandworm Team and APT28.

2/5

Disruptive and destructive cyber attacks are relatively infrequent when compared to
cyber espionage and other forms of information operations. Sandworm Team is
Russia’s preeminent cyber attack capability, having conducted complex attacks which
caused electrical outages in Ukraine as well as the most expensive destructive attack
in history: NotPetya. Another actor, who Mandiant calls TEMP.Isotope
(UNC806/UNC2486 aka Berserk Bear, Dragonfly), has a long history of compromising
critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe. While we have never seen this
actor attempt to disrupt that infrastructure, we believe these breaches are preparation
for a contingency when Russia is prepared to cause serious disruptions.

Information Operations
Information operations are a regular feature of Russian and Belarusian cyber activity. Such
actors leverage a variety of tactics to achieve their aims, including but not limited to the use
of social media campaigns involving coordinated and inauthentic activity, as well as the
compromise of entities in hack-and-leak operations or for use in disseminating fabricated
content to promote desired narratives.
Broadly speaking, information operations actors have sought to advance Russian
interests by exploiting existing divisions within and between adversary countries,
undermining confidence in democratic institutions, and creating distrust within the
NATO alliance, the European Union, and the West.
Fabricated content, such as forged documents, doctored photographs and fake
petitions, is regularly used in operations we have attributed to influence campaigns,
including Ghostwriter and Secondary Infektion.
Data obtained through intrusion activity has been leaked to great effect, causing
scandals with lasting consequences. We have observed pro-Russia actors alter or
falsify stolen data prior to leaking it, occasionally alongside unaltered data, to support a
given operation’s intended narrative.
Information operations actors have used third parties, such as journalists and
"hacktivists,” to legitimize information and narratives and launder their content. While
many such parties collaborated—wittingly or unwittingly—with those actors, we have
also observed campaigns, such as Ghostwriter, supported by the cyber espionage
actor UNC1151, compromise and leverage legitimate information sources. This
includes news or municipal government sites or social media accounts to disseminate
material.
Russian information operations campaigns, such as those conducted by the Internet
Research Agency, have also created and leveraged inauthentic personas and media
outlets to publish and promote content disseminating false narratives that serve to
achieve their ends.

Cyber Attacks

3/5

Disruptive and destructive cyber attacks take many forms, from distributed denial-of-service
attacks to complex attacks on critical infrastructure. Like its peers, Russia leverages this
capability in times of crisis.
Successful disruptions are often a matter of scale. The most effective disruptions have
broad effects. To achieve this, operators can focus on disrupting critical targets with
downstream customers and dependencies (such as the Ukrainian electric grid), or
directly disrupt a multitude of targets (as in the case of NotPetya).
Attacks against critical infrastructure and operational technology networks may take
more hands-on work and lead time than other methods. Actors such as TEMP.Isotope
appear to take a proactive stance towards compromising these targets. As such,
targets of this nature may have been compromised well in advance of this crisis for the
purposes of a contingency such as this. Defenders of these networks should consider
hunting for actors such as TEMP.Isotope.
Alternatively, destructive tools and other simpler methods could be leveraged against a
large cohort of targets simultaneously. Typically, Russian actors have used strategic
web compromise and the software supply chain to gain access at this scale. Mass
propagation through these methods may be early warning of impending cyber attack.
The perpetrators of attacks often fabricate evidence of culpability or make false
statements of responsibility designed to suggest that some other party is responsible
for the incident. They plant evidence in code and make public statements that suggest
incidents were carried out by previously unknown nationalist elements, criminals, or
government hackers. On multiple occasions, wipers have masqueraded as
ransomware, as in the case of the most recent incident in Ukraine. Though these “false
flags” are often paper-thin, they complicate efforts to convince the public of attribution
and make these operations more deniable.
Ransomware is a form of cyber attack that is being used by state affiliated actors as
part of “lock and leak” campaigns that have dubious financial motivations. Because of
its mature criminal underground, Russia has unmatched access to this capability. The
security services have previously leveraged criminal operations for national security
purposes and could bring them to bear in any number of ways to carry out their
mission.
Though destructive attacks observed thus far in this crisis appear to have focused on
government systems, civilian systems are usually targeted to greatest effect. These
actors have had particular success targeting utilities, but also by targeting
transportation and logistics, finance, and media.
Cyber attacks are most often leveraged as a form of information operation, meaning
they are meant to manipulate perception rather than have lasting disruptive effects.
Defenders often overestimate the technical capability necessary for these actors to
achieve their goals and underestimate the value of technically simple operations.

Outlook
4/5

Cyber capabilities are a means for states to compete for political, economic, and military
advantage without the violence and irreversible damage that is likely to escalate to open
conflict. While information operations and cyber attacks such as the 2016 US election
operations and the NotPetya incident can have serious political and economic
consequences, Russia may favor them because they can reasonably expect that these
operations will not lead to a major escalation in conflict.
Mandiant recommends that defenders take proactive steps to harden their networks against
and has provided a guide to this process, Proactive Preparation and Hardening to Protect
Against Destructive Attacks, for free to the public.
Free access to Mandiant Advantage is also available for qualifying organizations. With
access to this platform, users can obtain additional detailed information from Mandiant’s
intelligence operations that have not yet been publicly released.
