APT Groups Moving Down the Supply Chain

In August 2018, attackers broke into the network of Visma, a major managed services
provider in Norway that does more than $1 billion in business each year. Using stolen Citrix
credentials, the intruders made their way into the company’s network, then installed a custom
remote-access tool on an Active Directory controller and began moving around the network.
Eventually, the attackers harvested employee usernames and password hashes, packaged
them up, and exfiltrated the data to a Dropbox account.
The attack was part of a recent string of operations that some researchers say is the work of
APT10, a group associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security. APT10 has been
operating for many years and has drawn the attention of law enforcement and intelligence
agencies, including the Department of Justice, which indicted two Chinese citizens it says
are members of APT10. That group has been blamed for intrusions at a broad range of
organizations, including other managed services providers (MSP), in dozens of countries
around the world. Researchers consider APT10 one of the more capable and dangerous
cyberespionage groups operating at the moment, and the intrusion at Visma fits the group’s
pattern of targeting MSPs as a stepping stone to going after customers or other suppliers.
That strategy and targeting philosophy is one that more attack groups are adopting as
primary targets such as defense contractors, technology vendors, and financial companies
become more mature in their security programs and resilient to attack.

“We’ve seen a few groups do this, including several Chinese groups and some Russian
groups, too. I think there’s two reasons for it. One is that it’s a more efficient and effective
way of conducting operations. If you target an MSP or a cloud provider, you become part of
this infrastructure that companies have already invested in and trust,” said Priscilla Moriuchi,
director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a threat intelligence firm that
helped Visma investigate the Visma intrusion.
“It’s an effective way of doing targeting. Groups are increasingly targeting the global supply
chains and third parties because when you get in there, you have access to other targets.”
Although Recorded Future attributes the Visma intrusion to APT10, other researchers say it
may be the work of a separate group in China known as APT31, or Zirconium. Benjamin
Koehl of Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center said on Twitter that the C2 infrastructure bore
the hallmarks of APT31.
"This activity is not APT10. It is all APT31 (or ZIRCONIUM) in our terms. The C2 domains
that you mention were all registered and the threat actors made subsequent changes in
specific ways that we attribute (with other information) to ZIRCONIUM," he said.
Moriuchi said that APT10 and APT31 are both tied to the Chinese government and they
share a number of attributes, tactics, and techniques.
"It’s our belief that regardless of attribution delineation between APT10 and APT31 in this
case, the need for defenders to take action does not change, nor do our recommendations,"
she said.
We believe that APT10 and APT31 are closely linked and that Chinese state-sponsored
actors are associated with both groups. Today, there is little information publicly available on
APT31 and none that meaningfully separates it from the behavior or motivations of APT10;
APT31 tactics, techniques, malware, victims, perpetrators, and more are largely unknown.
We are now actively working to unearth everything we can on APT31 and have learned that
both APT10 and APT31 may share very similar techniques, malware, and are likely
attributed to the same Chinese state organization.
The August 2018 attack was a painful compromise, especially for a provider such as Visma,
whose business depends on customer trust. But rather than quickly contain it and kick the
dust under the rug, Visma officials decided to use the incident to show other organizations
that could be targets exactly what happened and what to look for. This is rare for a number of
reasons, mainly because of the embarrassment of the compromise and the potential effect it
could have on the company’s business. But Moriuchi said there’s quite a bit of value in
exposing the details of an operation like this.
“Visma is taking a stance to confront the attackers and say they’re not afraid,” she said. “We
really see that there’s deterrent value in this.”

The operation against Visma followed a familiar pattern and used tools that researchers had
previously seen, including the Trochilus RAT. The team also employed an interesting
technique in which operators rename a legitimate binary and then sideload a malicious
Windows DLL onto the compromised machine. That DLL then decrypts some shellcode and
injects the Trochilus RAT into memory.
“After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the
network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted
variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading technique.
Two separate infection chains leveraging this specific DLL sideloading technique were
identified on the Visma network using legitimate known good binaries that had DLL searchorder path issues. This means that APT10 actors had two separate access points into the
Visma network,” the Recorded Future analysis of the intrusion says.
That’s a slick technique, but it’s important to note that what enabled the attackers to get to
that point was stolen credentials. Sure, state-sponsored attack teams have custom malware,
private C2 infrastructure, and in many cases political cover, but even with all of that, they still
need a way in to a target network, and nothing suits that purpose like stolen credentials.
Pilfered usernames and passwords have the advantage of giving the attackers a simple way
in, and also let them avoid many network defenses. At least initially.
"Groups are increasingly targeting the global supply chains and third parties because
when you get in there, you have access to other targets.”
One of the things the Recorded Future researchers noticed is that the attackers
authenticated to the Visma network outside of the typical working hours for employees.
That’s a classic red flag, and Moriuchi said it’s a good reminder that these attackers are
humans, not bots.
“We miss the human element when we talk about this. There are people behind these
computers. They have lives and families and vacations. They make mistakes,” she said.
“The hours of operation are important.”
The human part of these operations also affects the targeting. APT teams generally are not
independent units making their own choices and selecting targets as they see fit. They have
bosses like anyone else and get orders that they’re bound to carry out.
“The reality is, for nation state groups, they’re part of the military or an intelligence agency
and are fulfilling the requirements of their bosses. You don’t just have one job. You’re
seeking multiple targets and multiple sources of information,” Moriuchi said.
Which explains why the attackers also targeted a law firm in the United States and an
international clothing company, intrusions that both involved the use of stolen Citrix
credentials. The law firm handles intellectual property cases, which makes it a likely target
for a cyberespionage team, but the apparel company is a less-obvious target at first blush.

But Moriuchi stressed that APT groups continuously learn from previous operations and
adjust their tools, tactics, and targeting as they progress. With primary targets becoming
more wary, moving down the supply chain becomes a more and more attractive option.
“It’s an interesting problem. We’ve seen that methodology migrate from the government and
defense area as the ultimate target has become more difficult to get to and vendors and
suppliers are targeted more often. We see this as behavior that will increase in the coming
years,” Moriuchi said.
“The Ministry of State Security and APT3 have performed attacks against MSPs and vendors
and they understand the vulnerability of the global supply chain.”
