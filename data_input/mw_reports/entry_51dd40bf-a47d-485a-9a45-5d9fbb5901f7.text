By David Liebenberg and Caitlin Huey.
For the seventh quarter in a row, Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) observed
ransomware dominating the threat landscape. The top variants were Ryuk and Vatet, which
is notable given the absence of Ryuk last quarter. We also observed variants of Egregor and
WastedLocker continuing to target organizations across the globe.
Unlike last quarter, however, these ransomware attacks overwhelmingly relied on phishes
delivering commodity trojan maldocs, such as Zloader, BazarLoader and IcedID. Nearly 70
percent of ransomware attacks relied on commodity trojans this quarter. Adversaries also
employ commercially available tools such as Cobalt Strike, open-source post-exploitation
tools like Bloodhound, and native tools on the victim’s system, such as PowerShell. For a
broader breakdown of these trends, check out our summary here.
CTIR engaged in several incident response engagements in which organizations
unknowingly downloaded trojanized updates to the widely deployed SolarWinds' Orion
software. Only one of these engagements involved post-compromise activity.
Looking forward, Microsoft recently announced four vulnerabilities in Exchange Server and
revealed that a threat actor named Hafnium had been exploiting these vulnerabilities to drop
web shells, targeting an array of organizations. Soon other threat actors began leveraging

these exploits as well, ranging from APTs to cryptominer groups, with affected organizations
estimated in the tens of thousands. CTIR has been responding to a growing number of
incidents involving the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.

Targeting
Actors targeted a broad range of verticals, including business management, construction,
education, energy and utilities, entertainment, financial, government, health care, industrial
distribution, legal, manufacturing and technology. Adversaries most often targeted health
care, as we anticipated last quarter given the spate of ransomware attacks targeting health
care organizations. It is worth noting there has been an increase in incidents involving Vatet
malware, which has been known to target health care organizations. CTIR identified a
potential pattern in which regional hospitals associated with a hospital in a given state is
initially attacked and may serve as follow-on targets, particularly if they have active VPN
connections to the affected organization. There are many reasons why actors are continuing
to target the health care industry, including the COVID-19 pandemic incentivizing victims to
pay to restore services as quickly as possible.

Threats
Ransomware continued to comprise the majority of threats CTIR observed. As opposed to
last quarter, which marked an absence of commodity trojans, the majority of these attacks
relied on commodity trojan maldoc phishes as an infection vector. Adversaries are continuing
to use commercially available tools as well: Cobalt Strike was observed in half of all
ransomware attacks this quarter. There were also numerous ransomware engagements that
leveraged open-source reconnaissance tools such as ADFind, ADRecon and Bloodhound.
Windows utilities were common, as well. For example, PowerShell was observed in nearly
65 percent of all ransomware attacks, while PsExec usage was observed in more than 30
percent. Other observed tools included dual-use tools such as TightVNC and CCleaner and
compression tools such as 7-Zip and WinRAR.
For example, in an incident response engagement involving an education organization in the
U.S., the target was initially infected via a phish containing a commodity trojan. In this case,
the phish contained a malicious Microsoft Excel attachment that executed the commodity
trojan Zloader when if the user enabled macros (CTIR assessed that this Zloader variant was
customized for the target based on the fact that its file hash had not been previously
observed). An employee at this organization opened the attachment and forwarded it to a
colleague. The adversary then pivoted in the environment, leveraging the Group Policy
replication mechanism in Windows Active Directory to distribute Ryuk and using PsExec to
move laterally and execute remote commands, in line with previous Ryuk behavior. The
2/5

adversaries obtained domain administrator (DA) credentials and, besides encrypting systems
on the network, also wiped backup indexes. More than 1,000 endpoints were encrypted,
causing significant damage to the organization, affecting Active Directory, DHCP, DNS and
anti-virus software.
In December 2020, Cisco Talos became aware of a sophisticated supply-chain attack in
which adversaries gained access to victims' networks via trojanized updates to SolarWinds'
Orion software. This attack targeted numerous large enterprises and U.S. government
agencies. CTIR engaged in several incident responses in which organizations had
unknowingly installed the compromised update. Only one of these engagements involved
post-compromise activity, such as malicious PowerUP PowerShell execution. PowerUP
appears to be part of PowerSploit, and is a collection of PowerShell modules that are used to
assist red teaming activities. While the PowerUP-like PowerShell script did not execute
anything at this time, it appeared to be set up as a wrapper or utility, possibly for additional
code to be funneled into. CTIR continues to monitor for activity related to the SolarWinds
compromise.
Beginning in March, CTIR has been responding to a growing number of incidents involving
the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. In one engagement, a customer in the payment
processor/technology sector saw no indication that CVE-2021-26855 was exploited. They
did, however, observe scanning behavior from a known IP address linked to these attacks,
which sent packets to a particular Exchange server beginning February 28. In another
engagement, a customer in the healthcare sector saw a CVE-2021-26855 exploit, though we
have yet to determine if the activity was just limited to scanning at this time. In one incident
response engagement affecting an organization in Germany, we saw a slight deviation from
the post-exploitation activity in the aforementioned engagements. The activity started in
much the same way, with the adversary installing web shells on the victim environment.
However, prior to the deployment of web shells, the customer saw the Domain Admin
account password was reset via the presence of the "Password last set" attribute in Active
Directory (AD).

Initial vectors
It was difficult to identify an initial infection vector in many engagements last quarter due to
shortfalls in logging. However, in engagements in which the initial vector could be identified,
or reasonably assumed, phishing remained the top infection vector for the seventh quarter in
a row. The vast majority of these were comprised of maldoc phishes as mentioned above.
However, there were also engagements involving business email compromise, such as when
an employee at an entertainment company received a phish with a spoofed Microsoft Online

3/5

login page, after which the adversary attempted to authenticate to their Office 365 account
from multiple locations. The adversary successfully authenticated and bypassed MFA
through use of a legacy application, highlighting the need to disable legacy protocols.
CTIR encourages all organizations to save their logs to make any potential incident response
engagements more efficient and effective.
Other notable initial vectors included exploitation of public-facing applications, such as an
education organization that had their F5 Load Balancer exploited via CVE-2020-5902 — a
remote code execution vulnerability in f5 — in the course of a DDoS attack. There were also
several instances of exploitation of a vulnerability in Telerik UI, tracked as CVE-2019-18935.
Talos first saw an increase in actors exploiting Telerik UI in summer 2020 — a trend that
continues today.

Top-observed MITRE ATT&CK techniques
Below is a list of the most common MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed in this quarter’s IR
engagements. Given that some techniques can fall under multiple categories, we grouped
them under the most relevant category in which they were leveraged. This represents what
CTIR observed most frequently and is not intended to be exhaustive.
Key Findings:
Phishing with malicious attachments and links accounted for a larger number of the
initial access techniques this quarter compared to the previous quarter.
We observed a variety of execution methods using native Windows utilities, such as
“rundll32.exe” and “msiexec.exe”. The use of these utilities may avoid triggering
security tools due to them being commonly used in daily operations.
Engagements involving cryptocurrency mining malware continue to be very low.
However, the number of ransomware engagements nearly doubled this quarter.
Leveraging valid accounts is the most observed lateral movement technique this
quarter. RDP usage and remote access services, such as TightVNC, for lateral
movement, increased this quarter.
