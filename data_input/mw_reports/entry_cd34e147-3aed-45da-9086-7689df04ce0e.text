Donot Team APT Group Is Back To Using Old Malicious Patterns

April 21, 2021

The Donot Team APT organization (APT-C-35) is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that targets organizations having
a government background. The threat group is known to carry out APT attacks against Pakistan, China, and countries in
South Asia. The group mainly uses malicious programs developed in C++, python, .net, and other languages.
In addition to spreading malware via spear phishing emails with attachments containing either a vulnerability or a malicious macro, this group
is particularly good at leveraging malicious Android APKs in their target attacks. These Android applications are often disguised as system
tools and can be identified by scanning them through VirusTotal. In some cases, these applications may be disguised
as fake apps, mobile games, and news apps. After installation, these apps perform the Trojan functions in the background. For instance, they
may remotely control the victim’s system and steal confidential information from the targeted device.
In a recent tweet, a security researcher shared the digests leading to the app. Upon analysis of the digests, researchers at Cyble found
all apps leading to the application package “com.update.gooqle”, a fake app disguised as a legitimate Google update application. For further
analysis, Cyble’s SaaS threat intelligence platform Cyble Vision was used to fetch more information on the application by picking one
digest from among the links shared in the Tweet.

Sample digest used for our analysis: be6ceeea0ca5df85c1788ae30cf0b7e6093aa543e3963a44b24139856ef083dd
As shown in Fig.1, the name of the sample digest is visible as “com.update.gooqle”. It is important to note that the package name
is spelled “gooqle” in an attempt to pass it off as ”Google”.
Below are the file hashes for the above digest:

Figure 2: Information on file hashes
As shown in the figure below, the scan result of the analyzed digest from VirusTotal reveals the application to be “A
Variant of Android/Spy.Agent.AGY”, which falls under spyware, a type of malware.

Figure 3:VirusTotalscan result
On reviewing the static code of the digest, the malware is seen to support up to 20 remote control commands, including test operations. The
remote-control commands include critical actions such as obtaining contact lists, text messages, call records, geographic locations, user files,
and installed applications, etc. For these actions to be performed, the app requests the following sensitive permissions, as found in its manifest
file.

In order to control the user’s mobile phone remotely, the malware obtains remote control command by reading a local database file.

Using the above permissions granted from users, the following data is fetched from the devices:
1. The app installs an application shortcut on the screen and removes its application launcher icon to stay hidden.

All the data collected from the device is saved in the “corresponding text” file. In case of the old variant of this malicious file, these
files are saved in the local file, while in the case of the new variant, the files are saved in the corresponding .json file and upload to the C2 link.

Upon further inspection of the Android package, we found that it communicates with the domain http://www.geoip-db.com to grab the
infected device’s geolocation information and external IP address. The URL https://www.geoip-db.com/json still works; however, the root of the
domain is no longer operational and directs users to a new location: http://geolocation-db.com/.

SafetyRecommendations:
1. Use security software on smartphones.
2. It is recommended to download mobile applications only through reliable application markets and avoid downloading and installing through
shared links.
3. Ensure the timely upgrading of the mobile phone operating system to reduce the possibility of attackers exploiting system vulnerabilities.
4. People concerned about the exposure of their stolen credentials in the darkweb can register at AmiBreached.com to ascertain their
exposure.
