May 11, 2020

Trojan Lampion is back after 3 months. The malware was observed last days with a new obfuscation layer, new C2, and distributed
inside an MSI file.
Trojan Lampion is a malware observed at the end of the year 2019 impacting Portuguese users using template emails from the Portuguese
Government Finance & Tax and EDP.
The latest campaigns in Portugal were observed during February 2020, according to the threat indicators available at 0xSI_f33d – The
Portuguese Abuse Open Feed. A new modified version of this malware was observed during May 2020 using template emails that
impersonate an invoice from a Bank transaction, an invoice from Vodafone Group, and in another scenario, emergency funds provided
by the Portuguese Government to help the COVID-19 fight.
Below, the email templates on how Lampion has been distributed in May 2020 in Portugal are presented.

Lampion email templates – May 2020
SAPO TRANSFER TEMPLATE
On May 8th, 2020, a fresh version of Lampion trojan was distributed using templates using the SAPO Transfer Cloud and the email related to a
bank transfer.

Figure 1: Lampion malware distributed via SAPO TRANSFER cloud.
As noted in previous campaigns, the threat is distributed on a VBS file along with other documents to lure victims.

In this scenario, a Microsoft Installer (MSI) file was used to disseminate the threat. The malicious file is downloaded from the Google API
Cloud.

Also, an MSI file was used to infect the victims (formulario_emergencial_gov.msi). In this case, the malicious file was downloaded from an
AWS S3 bucket. The modus operandi both malicious MSI file is the same and explained below. We are living in an era where crooks taking
advantage of the pandemic situation to launch new waves of phishing and malware every day.

Lampion May 2020 – Modus Operandi
According to the first appearance of this banking trojan in December 2019, the modus operandi remains as documented here. Only the way
how the malware is distributed has been changed along the time.
As observed in Figure 2, this is the classic form of Lampion. It poses as a VBS file along with other files, including an image and a PDF file to
lure the victims.
Nonetheless, Figure 3 and Figure 4 show another way how Lampion has been spread. Crooks are using an MSI file with the VBS file inside
(1st stage), that is executed to infect the victim’s device. Also, the VBS file is harder to understand, it is a bit bit more overshadowed in contrast
to the initial samples. In brief, these are the only changes observed in these fresh samples in contrast to December 2019.
Analyzing the MSI file from Figure 4, it poses as a file sent from the Portuguese Government to help in the COVID-19 fight.
Inside the MSI file is available the VBS file (Lampion – 1st stage), which is installed on “C:\Programs File (x86)\Firefox_2020-*\Firefox_2020*” when the MSI file is executed.

Figure 7: VBS file (1st stage) available and executed from C:\Programs Files (x86) folder.
From this point, the malware process is the same how documented in December 2019. However, the VBS file is now harder, with a new
obfuscation round (see Figure 8 below).

The next stage is downloaded through the execution of the VBS file on the infected device. In order to decode the URLs, we use the snippet of
code available here.
The analyzed samples (2nd stage) are download from the Google Cloud instead of AWS S3 buckets; as observed between December 2019
and February 2020.

The code and behavior of the malware are the same in the samples shared above, however, criminals introduce “new lots of junk” in each
sample as a means of bypassing AV signatures.
In order to corroborate that, it is possible to check the size of the PE files below.

Figure 9: Size of two samples distributed in Portugal during May 2020.
Both the files are executable files, with a difference in the size of the file. As mentioned, a lot of junk is put inside the PE file increasing, thus,
the file entropy and to bypass AV signatures.
Figure 10 shows image resources included inside the binary. In detail, 52.5MB from the total (63.3MB) are only populated by 12 images,
including a BPM image file of around 27 MB.

As noticed on other Trojans from Brazil, it was also coded in Delphi using the Embarcaredo IDE to build the executable file. In addition, the IDE
version used to build these samples is the same used to build the sample of December 2019.

11/23

Figure 11: Embarcadero Delphi version used in December 2019 also observed in May 2020.
This indicator shows what was observed during the analysis of the Trojan: only minor changes were made, such as: changing the address
of the C2 server.
The URLs themselves encoded to send information about the victim to C2 have the same name, e.g.: “PostaEstaBosta.php“.
More IOCs and C2 are presented towards the end of the publication. For more details about this malware see the initial publication from here.

When installed, the trojan can be used by crooks to launch overlay windows on the victim’s device. The number of templates used and affected
organizations are huge, including Brazilian, and Portuguese banks as presented below.

The overlay windows are invisible when malware is running and are triggered when the specific banking portal is accessed.

Lampion trojan can be also used by crooks to manually launch a specific page remotely.

Next, when a specific banking portal is accessed, the overlay windows are displayed (Figure 12 and 13 above), and data is sent to the C2
server.

Final Thoughts
Malware is nowadays one of the major cyber weapons to destroy a business, market reputation, and even infect a wide number of users. The
next list present some tips on how you can prevent a malware infection. It is not a complete list, just a few steps to protect yourself and your
devices.
Get outdated software of your system
Get email savvy; take several minutes looking at the new email and not a few seconds
Beware of fake tech support, emails related do bank transactions, invoices, COVID19, everything you think be strange
Keep Internet activity relevant
Log out at the end of the day
Only access secured and trusted sites (not only websites with green lock – please think you are doing, as many phishing campaigns are
abusing of free CA to create valid HTTPS certificates and to distribute malicious campaigns over it)
Keep your operating system up to date
Make sure you are using an antivírus
Beware of malvertising
And last but no the least, do not execute files and content from untrusted locations.

Take-home message
Be proactive and start taking malware protection seriously!
