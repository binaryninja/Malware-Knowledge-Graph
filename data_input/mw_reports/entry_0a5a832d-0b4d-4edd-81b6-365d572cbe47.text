Overview
APT groups often use some uncommon file types to host malicious code in order to increase
the probability of immunity against antivirus software, such as CD-ROM image files (.iso) and
virtual hard disk files (.vhd), which we have monitored for abuse in recent years. And the use
of these two formats can effectively circumvent the MOTW mechanism (a security measure
in which Windows displays a warning message when a user tries to open a file downloaded
from the Internet). The effectiveness of the Lazarus group's attack campaign was evident
back in November '22 when we disclosed that its attack components using the vhdx format
had a detection rate of 0 on VirusTotal.
When combing through the recently uploaded vhdx files we found that from September to
December 2022, Kasablanka group is suspected of attacking Russia, and its targets include
the Russian Federal Government Cooperation Agency, the Ministry of Foreign
Communications of the Astrakhan Region of Russia, etc., and the detection rate of some
samples is always 0.
Analyzing and organizing the captured samples, the Kasablanka group used a socially
engineered phishing email as the entry point for the attack, with a virtual disk image file
attached, which nested a variety of next-stage payload executions including lnk files, zip
packages, and executables. In the early stages of the attack the final execution was the
commercial Trojan Warzone RAT, in the later stages of the attack we observed that the
executed Trojan changed to Loda RAT.

Decoy File
A phishing attack against the Agency of the Government of the Russian Federation for CIS
Affairs, Aliens and International Humanitarian Cooperation, or "Россотрудничество".

The translation of the phishing email content is as follows：

2/17

Phishing email attack against the Ministry of Foreign Communications of the Astrakhan
Region of Russia.

The translation of the phishing email is as follows:

One of the phishing email attachments uses the situation related to the Republic of Turkey in
2022 as a bait.

3/17

Attacks using articles related to Russian import substitution and migration policy in 2015 as
bait.

In addition, the Kasablanka group intercepted the first page from Resolution No. 1725
published on the official website of the Government of the Russian Federation as a decoy.

4/17

And the relevant content of the draft Digital Code of Kyrgyzstan was used as a bait.

Sample Analysis
5/17

The captured samples are all virtual disk image files (.vhdx suffix), and the sample decoy
names and contents are in Russian and uploaded from Russian regions. Some of the
samples use lnk files as downloaders for the next stage payload.

Some attack samples package the decoy and Warzone RAT into a zip file in a virtual disk
image file.

Or there is no decoy file and the lnk file is directly disguised as a folder to lure victims to click
on it.

Warzone RAT
Warzone RAT, also known as AveMaria RAT, is a commercial trojan developed in pure
C/C++, which has been sold publicly on the internet as a software subscription since 2018
and is compatible with systems below Windows 10, with remote desktop, password stealing,
keylogging, remote commands, permission elevation, download execution and many other
remote control functions. It has been used by several APT groups, including Confucius,
Bitter, Blind Eagle (APT-Q-98) and other groups .

This captured Warzone RAT eventually establishes a TCP connection to the server
hbfyewtuvfbhsbdjhjwebfy.net (193.188.20.163) .

Loda RAT
Loda RAT is a proprietary malware written in AutoIt script language, first captured and
disclosed in the wild by Proofpoint in September 2016, the name 'Loda' derives from the
malware author's choice of directory to write keylogger logs to as Loda.Subsequently Cisco
discovered multiple variants of Loda RAT and found that the RAT added spying capabilities
to the Android platform. After a series of investigations, Cisco concluded that the group using
the malware was based in Morocco and named the group Kasablanka (the largest city in
Morocco) [1].
Analysis of the captured sample showed that it was written in C# and obfuscated so
extensively that common tools could not decompile it, and added a large amount of 00 data
at the end of the PE file, swelling the entire file size to 741MB.

10/17

After execution, the sample first releases and executes the Loda RAT packaged with AutoIt
in the %appdata% directory, and the AutoIt script can be restored by using the deep analysis
function of QiAnXin's Threat Intelligence Center Cloud Sandbox, and the behavior and
functions of the trojan can be seen by analyzing the script.

Loda RAT first detect antivirus products installed on victim machines through WMI
commands.

Followed operation is collecting some information of victim host, including permissions,
operating system version, etc.

11/17

And adding persistentence by creating %appdata%\Windata\svshost.exe and NFOKQN.lnk
shortcut to svshost.exe in windows startup directory.

Uploading the collected information and then takeing screenshots.

Subsequently enter the remote control loop, by processing the data returned by C2, and then
correspond to the detailed remote control instructions, and its remote control instructions
divided into a relatively fine function, rough statistics have 144 remote control instructions,
due to the reasons of space, we will not do a detailed introduction, a general overview of its
remote control functions.

Exit, uninstall
Create a GUI chat window to save the victim/attacker conversation to a file
In addition, in the previous version, LodaRAT downloaded SQLite3.dll from the official AutoIt
website because it was needed to extract sensitive information from the browser database,
but the embedded URL had been unavailable for download. So in the latest version, the
Kasablanka group transcoded it directly to hex, embedded in in the script.

13/17

Association & Attribution
In C2:193.149.129.151, we trace back to Trojan "systeml.dll", written in C# and only 8.5KB in
size, whose function is to download WinScp tools to synchronize files with remote computers
and set scheduled tasks to persist, making it a potential backdoor.

In another C2: 179.60.150.118, we associate two files packaged by Pyinstaller, both of them
are downloaders and have the same core code.

After Base64 decoding, you can clearly see that by requesting port 443 of 179.60.150.118 to
get the follow-up payload to execute, and the payload is Warzone RAT or CS Trojan.

14/17

Some security vendors believe that Loda RAT is the exclusive trojan of Kasablanka group,
but since Loda RAT is compiled from AutoIt scripts and its source code can be obtained by
decompiling it, 'false flag' activities by other threat actors using the decompiled source code
are also possible.
In terms of attack motivation, we believe that the purpose of this attack is mainly for
information gathering and espionage. Considering the current situation between Russia and
Ukraine, intelligence spying and espionage are more in line with the motivation of nationsponsered hacker groups, so we attribute this attack to Kasablanka group with moderate
confidence.

Summary
In previous disclosures of the Kasablanka group's operations, its targets included
Bangladesh, South America and the United States, and its Loda RAT includes Windows
version and Android version.Now this group often uses commercial RATs in its attack
activities, which not only reduces the development cost but also makes it difficult for tracing
attackers’ footprints.
The RedDrip team would like to remind all users not to open links of unknown origin shared
by social media, not to click on email attachments from unknown sources, not to run
unknown files with exaggerated titles, not to install APPs from informal sources, to back up
important files in a timely manner, and to update and install patches.
If you need to run or install an application of unknown origin, you can first identify it through
the QiAnXin Threat Intelligence File Deep Analysis Platform
(https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox/page). At present, it supports deep analysis of files
in various formats including Windows and Android platforms.
Currently, a full line of products based on the threat intelligence data from the QiAnXin
Threat Intelligence Center, including the QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP),
SkyRock, QiAnXin Advanced Threat Detection System, QiAnXin NGSOC, QiAnXin
Situational Awareness, etc., already support the accurate detection of such attacks [2].
