On June 10, South Korean web hosting company NAYANA was hit by Erebus ransomware
(detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_ELFEREBUS.A), infecting 153 Linux servers and
over 3,400 business websites the company hosts.
In a notice posted on NAYANA’s website last June 12, the company shared that the attackers
demanded an unprecedented ransom of 550 Bitcoins (BTC), or US$1.62 million, in order to
decrypt the affected files from all its servers. In an update on June 14, NAYANA negotiated a
payment of 397.6 BTC (around $1.01 million as of June 19, 2017) to be paid in installments.
In a statement posted on NAYANA’s website on June 17, the second of three payments was
already made. On June 18, NAYANA started the process of recovering the servers in

1/5

batches. Some of the servers in the second batch are currently experiencing database (DB)
errors. A third payment installment is also expected to be paid after the first and second
batches of servers have been successfully recovered.
While not comparable in terms of the ransom amount, this is reminiscent of what happened
to Kansas Hospital, which didn’t get full access to the encrypted files after paying the
ransom, but was instead extorted a second time.
Erebus was first seen on September 2016 via malvertisements and reemerged on February
2017 and used a method that bypasses Windows’ User Account Control. Here are some of
the notable technical details we’ve uncovered so far about Erebus’ Linux version:

encrypted files
Possible Arrival Vector
As for how this Linux ransomware arrives, we can only infer that Erebus may have possibly
leveraged vulnerabilities or a local Linux exploit. For instance, based on open-source
intelligence, NAYANA’s website runs on Linux kernel 2.6.24.2, which was compiled back in
2008. Security flaws like DIRTY COW that can provide attackers root access to vulnerable
Linux systems are just some of the threats it may have been exposed to.
Additionally, NAYANA’s website uses Apache version 1.3.36 and PHP version 5.1.4, both of
which were released back in 2006. Apache vulnerabilities and PHP exploits are well-known;
in fact, there was even a tool sold in the Chinese underground expressly for exploiting
Apache Struts. The version of Apache NAYANA used is run as a user of nobody(uid=99),
which indicates that a local exploit may have also been used in the attack.
Figure 3: VirusTotal submissions of the Erebus Linux ransomware
It’s worth noting that this ransomware is limited in terms of coverage, and is, in fact, heavily
concentrated in South Korea. While this may indicate that this ransomware attack is
targeted, VirusTotal showed otherwise—several samples were also submitted from Ukraine
and Romania. These submissions can also indicate they were from other security
researchers.
Encryption Routine
Some ransomware families are known to scramble files in layers of encryption algorithms,
such as UIWIX, later versions of Cerber, and DMA Locker. Erebus takes this up a notch;
each file encrypted by Erebus will have this format:
2/5

Header (0x438 bytes)
RSA-2048-encrypted original filename
RSA-2048-encrypted AES key
RSA-2048-encrypted RC4 key
RC4-encrypted data
The file is first scrambled with RC4 encryption in 500kB blocks with randomly generated
keys. The RC4 key is then encoded with AES encryption algorithm, which is stored in the file.
The AES key is again encrypted using RSA-2048 algorithm that is also stored in the file.
While each encrypted file has its RC4 and AES keys, the RSA-2048 public key is shared.
These RSA-2048 keys are generated locally, but the private key is encrypted using AES
encryption and another randomly generated key. Ongoing analysis indicates that decryption
is not possible without getting hold of the RSA keys.
Targeted File Types
Office documents, databases, archives, and multimedia files are the usual file types targeted
by ransomware. It’s the same for this version of Erebus, which encrypts 433 file types.
However, the ransomware appears to be coded mainly for targeting and encrypting web
servers and data stored in them.
Here is a table that shows the directories and system tablespaces that Erebus searches.
Note that var/www/ is where the files/data of websites are stored, while the ibdata files are
used in MySQL:

Adopt Best Practices
Despite their market share, Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux are poised
to be lucrative for bad guys as ransomware continues to diversify and mature in the threat
landscape. Why? They are a ubiquitous part of the infrastructures that power many
enterprises, used by workstations and servers, web and application development
frameworks, databases, and mobile devices, among others.
And as we’ve seen in other families like WannaCry, SAMSAM, Petya, or HDDCryptor, the
capability to affect servers and network shares amplifies the impact. A single, vulnerable
machine on a network is sometimes all it takes to infect connected systems and servers.
Given the risks to business operations, reputation, and bottom line, enterprises need to be
proactive in keeping threats like ransomware at bay. There is no silver bullet to ransomware
like Erebus, which is why IT/system administrators should have a defense-in-depth approach
to security. Best practices for mitigating ransomware include:
Backing up critical files
Disabling or minimizing third-party or unverified repositories
Applying the principle of least privilege
Ensuring servers and endpoints are updated (or deploying virtual patching)
Regularly monitoring the network
Inspecting event logs to check for signs of intrusions or infection
Some of the security mechanisms that can be considered are:

4/5

IP filtering as well as intrusion prevention and detection systems
Security extensions in Linux that manage and limit access to files or system/network
resources
Network segmentation and data categorization to curtail and mitigate infection and
further damage to data
Enabling privilege separation in Linux
We will update this post as more information from our analysis of this Linux ransomware
become available.
