Dragos first disclosed four new threat activity groups targeting ICS/OT last month in the ICS
Cybersecurity 2020 Year in Review report. In this blog post, we will provide more
information on one of the new groups: STIBNITE. The fundamental assessment of threats
tracked by Dragos is that they are explicitly attempting to gain access to ICS networks and
operations or are successful in achieving access, not simply trying to gain access to an
industrial organization. To learn more about ICS threat activity groups and how they’re
created, we invite you to read our blog post “Uncovering ICS Threat Activity Groups.”
Activity Group: a set of intrusion events related with varying degrees of confidence
by similarities in their features or processes used to answer analytic questions and
develop broad mitigation strategies that achieve effects beyond the immediate threat.

Dragos ICS Cybersecurity 2020 Year In Review

STIBNITE Activity Group Overview
The STIBNITE Activity Group targeted wind generation and government entities in
Azerbaijan. STIBNITE launched multiple intrusion operations against targets from late 2019
through 2020. STIBNITE leverages spearphishing to drop a custom malware known as
PoetRAT. Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that the adversary performed
focused intrusion and information gathering operations aligned with Stage 1 of the Industrial
Control System (ICS) Cyber Kill Chain.
STIBNITE activity focuses on a region, the Caucasus, not typically observed in ICS
targeting. As stated in past Dragos reporting and public comments, critical infrastructure
intrusions and ICS events can correlate to areas of latent or existing conflict. As a result,
known disruptive operations largely focus on existing conflict zones, such as Ukraine or the
Gulf region.
STIBNITE gains initial access via credential theft websites spoofing Azeri government
organizations, and spearphishing campaigns using variants of malicious Microsoft Office
documents.

The group leverages customized malware, called PoetRAT, for information gathering
activities and post exploitation activity including listing files, taking screenshots, transferring
files, and command execution. STIBNITE is known to use Dynamic Domain Name System
(DDNS) and common ports for C2 traffic. Dragos also discovered that STIBNITE reused
infrastructure between its 2020 campaigns.
STIBNITE uses an executable package of a Python-based implementation of Mimikatz
(PypyKatz) and the open-source LaZagne credential collection project for credential
harvesting. The group also uses other open-source resources for web browser credential
theft and data encoding and decoding routines using the Affine substitution cipher.
Credential harvesting tools could allow adversaries to propagate throughout the network. As
reported in the ICS Cybersecurity Year in Review, Dragos discovered that in 2020, 88
percent of Dragos services engagements involved significant issues with network
segmentation.
At this time, the extent of the group’s ICS interest is limited to targeting wind generation in
Azerbaijan. STIBNITE’s tools and targeting focus would enable transition from Stage 1
operations to a Stage 2 intrusion given developed access and stolen information, such as
user credentials. Dragos tracks many threats earlier in the ICS Cyber Kill Chain because
Activity Groups may cross over into the OT environment. It can take years for a Stage 1
group to transition into OT access depending on its objectives and timeline.

Detecting and Mitigating STIBNITE Activity

4/5

Although STIBNITE activity is currently focused on IT networks, information gathered –
such as logon credentials and network information – can be used to facilitate follow-on ICS
network compromise. OT operators should look for PoetRAT activity in IT and OT
environments through execution of Python and Lua.
The Dragos Platform incorporates multiple detections and analytics designed specifically to
detect credential reuse and malicious logon activity. Such tactics are deployed by multiple
activity groups tracked by Dragos, making coverage of such abuse vital for ICS network
protection. In the ICS Cybersecurity 2020 Year in Review, Dragos found that 90 percent of
its services customers lacked fundamental visibility into ICS environments. This means
most ICS asset owners and operators will be blind to threats and lack critical cybersecurity
data. Learn more about the value of asset visibility in building a comprehensive OT
cybersecurity program by downloading our OT asset visibility white paper.
Detections for all STIBNITE behaviors are available in the Dragos Platform.

ICS Considerations for the Future
The identified activity in Azerbaijan, while limited in scope at this time, emphasizes the
proliferation of ICS targeting in combination with more traditional tensions. Azerbaijan
remains at war with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region and continues to emerge
as an alternative oil and gas provider to Europe. As interest in ICS-related cyber effects
continues to increase, ICS-related intrusions such as those associated with STIBNITE will
only continue and grow.
