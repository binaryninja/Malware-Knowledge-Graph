The DarkSide ransomware operation has allegedly shut down after the threat actors lost
access to servers and their cryptocurrency was transferred to an unknown wallet.
This news was shared by a threat actor known as 'UNKN', the public-facing representative
of the rival REvil ransomware gang, in a forum post first discovered by Recorded Future
researcher Dmitry Smilyanets on the Exploit hacking forum.
In the post, 'Unkn' shared a message allegedly from DarkSide explaining how the threat
actors lost access to their public data leak site, payment servers, and CDN servers due to
law enforcement action.
"Since the first version, we have promised to speak honestly and openly about problems. A
few hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, namely : Blog,
Payment server, DOS servers," reads the forum post from UNKN.

"Now these servers are unavailable via SSH, the hosting panels are blocked. Hosting
support, apart from information "at the request of law enfocement agencies", does not
provide any other information."

This news comes a day after President Biden said in a White House press conference that
countries harboring ransomware networks must take action to shut them down.
"We do not believe — I emphasize, we do not believe the Russian government was
involved in this attack. But we do have strong reason to believe that criminals who did the
attack are living in Russia. That’s where it came from — were from Russia," Biden said in
a press conference about the Colonial Pipeline attack.
"We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible
countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks."
Starting yesterday, security researchers and journalists noted that the DarkSide data leak
site was no longer accessible, and it was speculated that law enforcement had seized the
server.

Offline DarkSide data leak site
However, BleepingComputer has confirmed that the DarkSide Tor payment server is still
operational at the time of this writing. If law enforcement seized the server, they might have
kept it running to allow victims to access their decryptors.

DarkSide Tor payment live at the time of writing
Feeling the heat from law enforcement, it has also been speculated that the DarkSide
ransomware gang may be pulling an exit scam.
After pulling in $9.4 million in ransom payments this week between Brenntag and Colonial
Pipeline, they may be stealing the money, so they do not have to pay affiliates and to blame
it on a law enforcement operation.

DarkSide shuts down affiliate program
After we published our story, Intel471 gained access to the full message sent to affiliates of
the DarkSide ransomware-as-a-service operation.
According to this message, DarkSide decided to close their operation "due to the pressure
from the US" and after losing access to their public-facing servers.
The full translated message acquired by Intel471 is below:

4/7

Starting from version one, we promised to speak about problems honestly and openly.
A couple of hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, in
particular to the
blog
payment server
CDN servers
At the moment, these servers cannot be accessed via SSH, and the hosting panels
have been blocked.
The hosting support service doesn't provide any information except "at the request of
law enforcement authorities." In addition, a couple of hours after the seizure, funds
from the payment server (belonging to us and our clients) were withdrawn to an
unknown account.
The following actions will be taken to solve the current issue: You will be given
decryption tools for all the companies that haven't paid yet.
After that, you will be free to communicate with them wherever you want in any way
you want. Contact the support service. We will withdraw the deposit to resolve the
issues with all the affected users.
The approximate date of compensation is May 23 (due to the fact that the deposit is
to be put on hold for 10 days on XSS).
In view of the above and due to the pressure from the US, the affiliate program is
closed. Stay safe and good luck.
The landing page, servers, and other resources will be taken down within 48 hours.
An interesting point in this message is that the affiliates will be provided decryptors for their
victims. These decryptors will allow the affiliates to extort those victims on their own without
any affiliation with DarkSide.

REvil ransomware adds new restrictions
Historically, the REvil ransomware gang has shown no scruples regarding who they attack.
However, after the DarkSide's reported takedown, REvil has now begun to impose new
restrictions on who can be encrypted.
REvil's representative, UNKN, states that affiliates are now required first to gain permission
to target an organization and that they can no longer target the following entities:
5/7

1. Work in the social sector (health care, educational institutions) is prohibited;
2. It is forbidden to work on the gov-sector (state) of any country;
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations have historically run as a free-for-all, where
affiliates encrypt any victim they want without gaining prior approval.
It will be interesting to see if these new rules will lead affiliates to move to other RaaS
operations with fewer restrictions.
Update 5/14/21: Added full message sent to affiliates about DarkSide closing down.
Changed DoS to CDN (thx Evgueni).

There needs to be more severe repercussions. I know everyone's focus is on
prevention. But full-circle prevention has to include repercussions. At this point, the
word 'hitmen' comes to mind.
