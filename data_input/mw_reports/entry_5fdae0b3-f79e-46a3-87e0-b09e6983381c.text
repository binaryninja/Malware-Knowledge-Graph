Check Point Research reports that Emotet Trojan launched a new
campaign last month to evade Microsoft’s macro block, sending
spam emails containing malicious OneNote files. Meanwhile Ahmyth
was the most prevalent mobile malware and Log4j took top spot
once again as the most exploited vulnerability
Our latest Global Threat Index for March 2023 saw researchers uncover a new malware
campaign from Emotet Trojan, which rose to become the second most prevalent malware
last month.
As reported earlier this year, Emotet attackers have been exploring alternative ways to
distribute malicious files since Microsoft announced they will block macros from office files. In
the latest campaign, the attackers have adopted a new strategy of sending spam emails
containing a malicious OneNote file. Once opened, a fake message appears to trick the
victim into clicking the document, which downloads the Emotet infection. Once installed, the
malware can gather user email data such as login credentials and contact information. The
attackers then use the gathered information to expand the reach of the campaign and
facilitate future attacks.
While big tech companies do their best to cut off cybercriminals at the earliest point, it’s near
impossible to stop every attack from bypassing the security measures. We know that Emotet
is a sophisticated Trojan and it’s no surprise to see it has managed to navigate Microsoft’s
1/5

latest defenses. The most important thing people can do is make sure they have appropriate
email security in place, avoid downloading any unexpected files and adopt heathy skepticism
about the origins of an email and its contents.
Last month also revealed that “Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution” was the most
exploited vulnerability, impacting 44% of organizations globally, followed by “HTTP Headers
Remote Code Execution” with 43% of organizations worldwide and “MVPower DVR Remote
Code Execution” with a global impact of 40%.
Top Malware Families
*The arrows relate to the change in rank compared to the previous month.
Qbot was the most prevalent malware last month with an impact of more than 10% on
worldwide organizations respectively, followed by Emotet and Formbook with a 4% global
impact.
1. ↔ Qbot – Qbot AKA Qakbot is a banking Trojan that first appeared in 2008. It was
designed to steal a user’s banking credentials or keystrokes and is often distributed via
spam emails. Qbot employs several anti-VM, anti-debugging and anti-sandbox
techniques to hinder analysis and evade detection.
2. ↑ Emotet – Emotet is an advanced, self-propagating and modular Trojan. Emotet used
to be employed as a banking Trojan but has recently been used as a distributor to other
malware or malicious campaigns. It uses multiple methods for maintaining persistence
and evasion techniques to avoid detection. In addition, it can be spread through
phishing spam emails containing malicious attachments or links.
3. ↓ FormBook – FormBook is an Infostealer targeting Windows OS and was first
detected in 2016. It is marketed as Malware as a Service (MaaS) in underground
hacking forums for its strong evasion techniques and relatively low price. Formbook
harvests credentials from various web browsers, collects screenshots, monitors and
logs keystrokes and can download and execute files according to orders from its C&C.
4. ↑ AgentTesla – AgentTesla is an advanced RAT functioning as a keylogger and
information stealer, which is capable of monitoring and collecting the victim’s keyboard
input, system keyboard, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating credentials to a variety of
software installed on a victim’s machine (including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and
the Microsoft Outlook email client).
5. ↓ XMRig – XMRig is open-source CPU mining software used to mine the Monero
cryptocurrency. Threat actors often abuse this open-source software by integrating it
into their malware to conduct illegal mining on victims’ devices.
6. ↔ GuLoader – Guloader is a downloader that has been widely used since December
2019. When it first appeared, GuLoader was used to download Parallax RAT but has
been applied to other remote access trojans and info-stealers such as Netwire,
FormBook, and Agent Tesla.
2/5

7. ↑ Remcos – Remcos is a RAT that first appeared in the wild in 2016. Remcos
distributes itself through malicious Microsoft Office documents, which are attached to
SPAM emails, and is designed to bypass Microsoft Windows’s UAC security and
execute malware with high-level privileges.
8. ↑ NJRat – NJRat is a remote accesses Trojan, targeting mainly government agencies
and organizations in the Middle East. The Trojan first emerged in 2012 and has
multiple capabilities: capturing keystrokes, accessing the victim’s camera, stealing
credentials stored in browsers, uploading and downloading files, performing process
and file manipulations, and viewing the victim’s desktop. NJRat infects victims via
phishing attacks and drive-by downloads, and propagates through infected USB keys
or networked drives, with the support of Command & Control server software.
9. ↔ Tofsee – Tofsee is a Trickler that targets the Windows platform. This malware
attempts to download and execute additional malicious files on target systems. It may
download and display an image file to a user to hide its true purpose.
10. ↓ NanoCore – NanoCore is a Remote Access Trojan that targets Windows operating
system users and was first observed in the wild in 2013. All versions of the RAT contain
basic plugins and functionalities such as screen capture, crypto currency mining,
remote control of the desktop and webcam session theft.
Top Attacked Industries Globally
Last month, Education/Research remained the most attacked industry globally, followed by
Government/Military and then Healthcare.

Top Exploited Vulnerabilities
Last month, “Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution” was the most exploited vulnerability,
impacting 44% of organizations globally, followed by “HTTP Headers Remote Code
Execution” with 43% of organizations worldwide and “MVPower DVR Remote Code
Execution” with a global impact of 40%.
1. ↑ Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-44228) – A remote code
execution vulnerability exists in Apache Log4j. Successful exploitation of this
vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected
system.
2. ↑ HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-10826,CVE-2020-10827,CVE2020-10828,CVE-2020-13756) – HTTP headers let the client and the server pass
additional information with an HTTP request. A remote attacker may use a vulnerable
HTTP Header to run arbitrary code on the victim machine.

3/5
