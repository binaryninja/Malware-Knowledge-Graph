1. NATO Allies support and stand in solidarity with the United States, following its 15
April announcement of actions to respond to Russia’s destabilising activities. Allies are
taking actions individually and collectively to enhance the Alliance’s collective security.
2. Russia continues to demonstrate a sustained pattern of destabilising behaviour,
including its violations of Ukraine’s and Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and continued violation, non-implementation, and circumvention of numerous
international obligations and commitments, including the Budapest Memorandum.
Examples include attempted interference in Allied elections, including the U.S.
presidential election; widespread disinformation campaigns; and malicious cyber
activities. The United States and other Allies assess that all available evidence points
to the responsibility of the Russian Federation for the SolarWinds hack. We stand in
solidarity with the United States. We condemn the attack on Alexei Navalny, a
Russian opposition figure, with the use of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok
group. Any use of chemical weapons, under any circumstances, is a clear breach of
international law and contrary to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Reports that
Russia encouraged attacks against U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan are also of
concern.
3. Allies will continue to work in close consultation to address Russia’s actions, which
constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on Russia to cease immediately
its destabilising behaviour, and to uphold its international obligations, as Allies do
theirs, including existing arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation agreements
and commitments. We also call on Russia to cease its provocations and to
immediately de-escalate tensions on Ukraine’s borders and in illegally-annexed
Crimea.
4. While we continue to ensure our deterrence and defence posture, NATO remains
open to periodic, focused, and meaningful dialogue, and to a constructive relationship
with Russia when Russia’s actions make that possible. We regret that Russia
continues to disregard NATO’s early 2020 invitation to hold a meeting of the NATORussia Council.
