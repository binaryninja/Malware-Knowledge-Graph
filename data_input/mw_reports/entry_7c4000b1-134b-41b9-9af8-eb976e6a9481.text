It has been well over a decade since cybersecurity professionals began warning about both
nation-state and financially motivated cyber-kinetic attacks. Concerned about a cybersecurity
threat that would have the potential to destroy physical assets and human lives, many looked

to sound the alarm in industrial organizations, tracking the vulnerabilities that could lead to a
compromise in operational technology networks.
A variety of attacks in that realm took place over the years, whether launched in nation-state
conflicts across the globe or as an apparent amateur challenge. Most recently,
cybercriminals who deploy ransomware targeted a large U.S. refined products pipeline
system, causing disruption to its operations and making headlines across the world. The
attack reportedly only affected IT networks but had the potential to spread to operational
zones and upstream to the overall supply chain — an attack scenario that could be much
more damaging.
Unlike many attacks on industrial organizations that have been connected to adversarial
nation-states, it seems that the pipeline attack might be a cybercrime case motivated by a
large bounty. The group suspected in this hit goes by the name “DarkSide.”
IBM Security X-Force data shows that ransomware has become the number one threat type
X-Force responded to in 2020 accounting for 23% of actual attacks that impacted
organizations. Of those, our incident response data shows 59% of attacks were doubleextortion cases, where in addition to having their data encrypted, victims were also
threatened with data being leaked unless they paid for a decryption key by a specified
deadline.
X-Force incident response data further shows that ransomware attacks were the most
common threat to organizations that use operational technology (OT) in 2020. Sectors we
examined in our data include manufacturing, oil and gas, transportation, utilities,
construction, and mining, where ransomware attacks accounted for 33% of all attacks we
responded to. This trend suggests that threat actors may be finding organizations with OT
networks to be particularly attractive for ransomware attacks precisely because of the costly
downtime and impact on a wider ecosystem and on individual consumers.

Who is on the DarkSide?
In August 2020, a new ransomware gang announced its entry into the cybercrime arena. In
no less than a “press release” of sorts, its operators declared they had developed the perfect
ransomware tool because other codes they used in the past were not up to the task. The
post appeared on the group’s TOR domain where the newcomers also advised they were not
inexperienced cybercriminals and acted as former affiliates to other successful gangs,
making millions of dollars in the process. The malware itself has small similarities to the
GandCrab and Sodinokibi ransomware, as does the ransom note’s template. Another
similarity is that DarkSide is designed to avoid computers where a language layout
corresponds with one of 17 countries from the former Soviet Union, adding Syrian Arabic —
another similarity to Sodinokibi. When looking for affiliates to join their ranks, tech-savvy
Russian speakers need apply. They further stress that they are not interested in “English

speaking personalities.” DarkSide has also noted that while they plan to target
organizations, they would aim for those who ‘can pay’ and spare healthcare, schools, nonprofits, and government.

New Group, Old TTPs
Like other gangs that operate modern ransomware codes, such as Sodinokibi and Maze,
DarkSide blends crypto-locking data with data exfiltration and extortion. If they are not initially
paid for a decryption key, the attackers threaten to publish confidential data they stole from
the victim and post it on their dedicated website, DarkSide Leaks, for at least 6 months.
When a ransom note appears on an encrypted networked device, the note also
communicates a TOR URL to a page called “Your personal leak page” as part of the threat
that if the ransom is not paid, data will be uploaded to that URL. Ransom is demanded in
Bitcoin or Monero. If it is not paid by a specific initial deadline, the amount doubles.

A favorite entry point appears to be connecting via RDP on port 443 typically routing via a
TOR browser. This is concurrent with a trend X-Force has been observing in similar attacks
on organizational networks where attackers opt to scan and exploit targets rather than using
compromised credentials.
Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike are part of the DarkSide attackers’ arsenal. Used in postexploitation, Cobalt Strike stagers help attackers control infected devices. ‘Stagers’ are tiny
programs that download the larger Beacon payload and pass control to it.
Different parts of the attack are manually performed by an attacker, typically using familiar
yet extensive living-off-the-land tactics. In cases of weakly secured or unmonitored servers,
attackers were able to easily expand their ability to collect data and move laterally. Using
Windows Active Directory tools, some cases lead to a DCSync attack that can end in the
exposure of all AD data to the attacker and subsequent Golden Ticket attacks.

In various DarkSide attacks, systems, where an EDR solution was installed were avoided.

Need for Speed — DarkSide v2.0
Most ransomware operators understand that they need speed to encrypt as much data as
possible as quickly as they can. They, therefore, opt to use symmetric encryption for that first
phase and then encrypt the first key with an asymmetric key. In DarkSide’s case, they claim
to have come up with an accelerated implementation; the malware uses the Salsa20 stream
cipher to encrypt victim data. They include an 80-byte public RSA-1024 key embedded in the
malware’s executable file and use it to encrypt the Salsa20 matrix. If implemented correctly, it
is not possible to break this key and victims will have to find other ways to get their data back
to an operational state.
Interestingly, to assure victimized organizations that they can make good on their decryption
promises, DarkSide advertised their ability to provide the “fastest ever decryption speed.”
The malware can attack both Windows and Linux environments, making enterprise servers
just as ‘encryptable’ as an employee’s endpoint. DarkSide can also attack virtual machines
and encrypt data on their hard drives.
Where DarkSide attackers do take their time is the first stage of the attack. They do not
initiate the encryption process until they have attained other objectives that can help them
maximize eventual leverage on the victim, such as mapping networks and backups, setting
up user access they can work with, and exfiltrating data they plan to leak later if they are not
paid.

A Self-Confessed Financially Motivated Attack
The past decade saw ransomware evolve from a nuisance into one of the most impending
risks CISOs and security leaders must reckon with, no matter the sector they operate within.
The urgent need for incident response plans and capabilities has increased exponentially
and has proven to be essential to mitigating risk, impact, and long-term results of cyberattacks.
Disruption, extortion, and sometimes destruction are the hallmarks of cyber attackers out to
demand a ransom, as the phenomenon grows over time. Ransomware attacks have been
denounced and warned against by industry leaders and government officials alike. While
addressing the U.S. Congress, former CISA director Chris Krebs noted that with raging
ransomware attacks “we are on the cusp of a global digital pandemic driven by greed.”
The group, when asked about their motivations, responded on social media that their aims
were financial.

“We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a
defined government and look for other our motives.
Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society.
From today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want
to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.”

The growing number of ransomware incidents around the globe has made this a critical issue
for national governments. As this attack continues to unfold, experts say fuel prices in the
U.S. are likely to rise 2-3% starting May 10th, but the impact will continue to increase for as
long as the pipeline is offline. A government-issued emergency waiver allows for the
temporary delivery of fuel products via ground transportation until the pipeline’s operations
are restored.

Adopting a Zero Trust Approach to Reduce Risk
Zero trust is a framework that assumes a complex network’s security is always at risk to
external and internal threats. It helps organize and strategize a thorough approach to counter
those threats.
By assuming that every connection and endpoint is considered a threat, a zero trust
approach leans on a framework that protects against these threats, whether external or
internal, even for those connections already inside. In a nutshell, a zero-trust network:
5/8

Logs and inspects all corporate network traffic
Limits and controls access to the network
Verifies and secures network resources
To expand, the zero-trust security model is designed so that data and resources are
inaccessible by default. Users can only access them on a limited basis under the right
circumstances, known as least-privilege access. A zero-trust security model verifies and
authorizes every connection, such as when a user connects to an application or software, to
a data set via an application programming interface (API). It requires that the interaction
meets the conditional requirements of the organization’s security policies. A zero-trust
security strategy also authenticates and authorizes every device, network flow, and
connection based on dynamic policies, using context from as many data sources as
possible. Learn more about IBM Security’s zero trust approach.
X-Force is advising organizations to be on alert for growing ransomware attacks and to be
prepared with offline backups while implementing network segmentation and applying critical
patches to reduce the risk. Companies also need to test detection capabilities with adversary
simulation and red teaming, as well as rehearse and test incident response plans to identify
gaps, so they can limit the spread of an attack if and when one happens. If you have more
