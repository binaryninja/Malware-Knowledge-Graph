December 8, 2022

On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that
have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware
Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the
evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those
variants.
This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers Vohuk, ScareCrow, and AERST
ransomware.
Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users
Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption

1/5

Severity level: High

Vohuk Ransomware
Like most ransomware, the new Vohuk variant encrypts files on compromised machines and
tries to extort money from victims. Its dropped ransom note, “README.txt”, asks victims to
contact the attacker via email with a unique ID assigned to each victim. As seen in the
ransom note, this Vohuk ransomware variant is version 1.3, potentially indicating that the
attacker has updated the ransomware several times.

Files encrypted by Vohuk ransomware have a “.Vohuk” file extension. It also replaces file
icons with a red lock icon.

The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own.

The ransomware leaves a distinctive mutex, “Global\\VohukMutex”, which prevents different
instances of Vohuk ransomware from running on the same system.
Based on the file submission locations to VirusTotal, Vohuk ransomware has primarily
affected Germany and India.

ScareCrow Ransomware
ScareCrow is another typical ransomware that encrypts files on victims’ machines. Its
ransom note, also titled “readme.txt”, contains three Telegram channels that victims can use
to speak with the attacker. While no financial demand is requested in the ransom note,
victims will most likely be asked to pay ransom to recover their encrypted files. At the time of
this writing, those three Telegram channels were unavailable.
ScareCrow ransomware appears to have some similarities with the infamous Conti
ransomware: both use the CHACHA algorithm to encrypt files and delete shadow copies
using wmic based on shadow copy IDs. This is not all that surprising because the Conti
ransomware source code was reportedly leaked earlier in the year. However, the ScareCrow
threat actor put some effort into developing this ransomware variant, as our analysis found
some significant differences. For example, Conti encrypts all command strings with one
decryption routine, whereas ScareCrow encrypts every string, including the name of the
DLLs it loads (i.e., kernel32), the name of the APIs it uses, and even the command strings
with its own decryption routine.

ScareCrow ransomware adds a “.CROW” file extension to affected files.

ScareCrow ransomware files were submitted to VirusTotal from Germany, India, Italy, the
Philippines, Russia, and the United States. This indicates that this ransomware is relatively
widespread, albeit by using unknown infection vectors.

AESRT Ransomware
AESRT is a new ransomware strain that FortiGuard Labs recently came across. It encrypts
files on compromised machines and appends an “.AESRT” file extension to the files it
encrypts. Instead of leaving a ransom note, the ransomware displays a popup window that
includes the attacker’s email address. It also accepts a field to enter the purchased key
required to decrypt the ransomed files. The ransomware also deletes shadow copies, which
inhibits the victim’s ability to recover files.

FortiGuard Labs Guidance
Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an
organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable
information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.
Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider
leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing
threats:
The FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations
test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper
practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.
Our FREE NSE training: NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness includes a module on
internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from
various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs.
Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and
security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk
of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce
telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere.
Cloud-based security solutions, such as SASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced
endpoint security, such as EDR (endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt

malware mid-attack; and Zero Trust Access and network segmentation strategies that restrict
access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated
to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.
As part of the industry's leading fully integrated Security Fabric, delivering integration and
automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of
technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our
global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.

Best Practices include Not Paying a Ransom
Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against
paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered.
According to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional
organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit
activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by
ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page where victims can submit samples
of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).
