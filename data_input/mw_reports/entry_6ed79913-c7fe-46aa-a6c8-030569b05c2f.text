Sasfis Propagation

2/4

Naming and tracking different malware families still leaves much to be
desired, so for lack of a better alternative, I'm using the term Sasfis. It's
function appears to be a general bot-net and is mostly leveraged to
install other malware such as key-logging/banking-trojans such as
Zeus or scareware like the many variants of Fake Anti-virus that is
currently in the wild.

I've been seeing this payload quite often this week. The most common
way I see it is in fake shipping invoices. Today I received a welltargeted email using obviously-compromised user-contact data. It
claimed to be from the state business tax department, and encouraged
the recipient to install the (fake) secure-gateway software so that they
could continue to pay their sales taxes online.
I'm being intentionally vague about the state since I'm haven't been
able to contact them (abuse@$STATE$.gov bounces, for shame) but
needless to say, if your state is distributing security software to you, it
shouldn't be hosted in Moldova.
The detection of the malware was low, only 3 out of 40 at virus total.
The host of the command and control server is also well aware of
certain public sandboxes' IP addresses; their reports of network
behavior were obviously blocked, and I managed to get one of my test
IP addresses similarly blocked while playing around with the code
today. They're upping their game.
For those looking for this on their networks, look for HTTP-like activity
out to v-medical.org and 89.187.53.203.

The activity and netblock you mention makes me think that this is
related to Bredolab.
