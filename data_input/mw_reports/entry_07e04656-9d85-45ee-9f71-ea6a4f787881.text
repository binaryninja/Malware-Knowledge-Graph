During our regular OSINT research, Cyble Research Labs came across a twitter post by the MalwareHunter
team, highlighting a ransomware named RURansom which was found attacking Russia. This malware is
called RURansom as the file’s Program Database (PDB) contains a sub string “RURansom”, as shown
below:
C:\Users\Admin1\source\repos\RURansom\RURansom\obj\Debug\RURansom.pdb
The ongoing cyber warfare between Russia and Ukraine has witnessed a series of different Wiper Malware
attacks including WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, and IsaacWiper malware. Adding to this existing list of
destructive malware, researchers have now found the RURansom wiper malware.
The RURansom malware operates by wiping the files present in the victim’s computer and spreads like a
worm within the network or through connected USB devices. Finally, the malware drops ransom notes in the
Victim’s machine as shown in Figure 1.

Technical Analysis
In this blog, we will conduct a deep-dive technical analysis of the RURansom Malware used in the attack. We
have analysed the sample SHA256107da216ad99b7c0171745fe7f826e51b27b1812d435b55c3ddb801e23137d8, which is a 32-bit PE file
written in the .NET programming language.

RURansom Malware

Geolocation Identification
The RURansom malware traces the IP location of the victim machine and is executed only if it detects an IP
belonging to Russia. For IP identification, the malware uses two APIs named https://api.ipify.org and
https://ip-api.com that are hardcoded within its code.

Location Identification

Privilege Escalation
After identifying the geolocation of the machine, the malware further checks for the Administrator rights in the
infected machine, as shown in Figure 4 and 5.

Malware

Figure 5:

IsElevated Function
If the malware does not get Admin privileges, it tries to execute itself in the elevated mode using the following
PowerShell command.
cmd.exe /c powershell stART-PRoceSS Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location -veRB rUnAS

Discovery of connected Drives

3/8

The RURansom wiper malware proceeds to scan the drives in the victim’s system, including the removable
and network drives connected to the victim’s machine.

for Drives

Encryption and Deletion
After scanning the drives, the malware encrypts all the files from the identified directories and sub-directories
in the victim’s machine. To prevent the recovery of the encrypted data from the backup files, the malware also
deletes the .bak files from the infected machines.

Encryption & Deletion

Encryption Algorithm
Our research indicated that the malware uses the AES-CBC encryption algorithm to encrypt files in the
victim’s machine.

Ransom Note
Finally, the RURansom malware drops a ransom note file named Полномасштабное_кибервторжение.txt
(Full-blown_cyber-invasion.txt). The note is written in Russian and dropped in all the directories where the
files are encrypted. The ransom note and file name are shown in the figure below.

Note in Russian
The image below showcases the English translation of the ransom note dropped by RURansom malware.

Encryption Key
As per our research, we have observed that the files are encrypted using a randomly generated AES key.
The key is calculated using the hard-coded strings such as FullScaleCyberInvasion, RU_Ransom, and 2022
along with Victim’s Machine Name and UserName. Figure 12 shows the code that generates random AES
key.

Spreading Mechanism
The malware renames itself as Россия-Украина_Война-Обновление.doc.exe (Russia-Ukraine_WarUpdate.doc.exe) and spreads to all connected systems.

Similarities with dnWiper
After a deep-dive analysis of the Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) identified in the RURansom
wiper malware, we have observed that it has several similarities with dnWiper. Researchers at TrendMicro
also believe that the same Threat Actors are behind the two wiper malware, as stated in their report.
The major difference between the RURansom & dnWiper malware is that the latter targets only specific
extensions such as .doc, .docx, .png, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .mp4, etc., while RuRansom encrypts all file extensions.

Conclusion

6/8

The files encrypted by the RURansom wiper malware are irreversible. Based on the ransom note and the
technical specifications of the malware, we suspect that it has been devised to target Russia, but the identity
of the Threat Actors behind this malware is still unknown.
Given the continued conflict and geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, we expect an increase in
cyber warfare with both nations targeting each other.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the suggestions given below:
Don’t keep important files at common locations such as the Desktop, My Documents, etc.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected devices
wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including
PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.
