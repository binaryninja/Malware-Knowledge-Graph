Malware experts at CSE Cybsec uncovered a massive malvertising
campaign dubbed EvilTraffic leveraging tens of thousands
compromised websites. Crooks exploited some CMS vulnerabilities
to upload and execute arbitrary PHP pages used to generate
revenues via advertising.
In the last days of 2017, researchers at CSE Cybsec observed threat actors exploiting some
CMS vulnerabilities to upload and execute arbitrary PHP pages used to generate revenues
via advertising. The huge malvertising campaign was dubbed EvilTraffic
The compromised websites involved in the EvilTraffic campaign run various versions of the
popular WordPress CMS. Once a website has been compromised, attackers will upload a
“zip” file containing all the malicious files. Despite the “zip” file has different name for each
infection, when it is uncompressed, the files contained in it have always the same structure.
We have found some of these archives not used yet, so we analyzed their content.
The malicious files are inserted under a path referring probably different versions of the
same malware (“vomiu”, “blsnxw”, “yrpowe”, “hkfoeyw”, “aqkei”, “xbiret”, “slvkty”).

Under this folder there are:
a php file, called “lerbim.php”;
a php file, that has the same name of the parent dir; it has initially “.suspected”
extension and only in a second time, using “lerbim.php” file, it would be changed in
“.php” file;
two directories, called “wtuds” and “sotpie”, containing a series of files.
An example of this structure is shown in the following figure:

The main purpose of the “malware” used in the EvilTraffic campaign is to trigger a redirecting
chain through at least two servers which generate advertising traffic.
The file “{malw_name}.php” becomes the core of all this context: if it is contacted by the user
through the web browser, it redirects the flow first to “caforyn.pw” and then to “hitcpm.com”,
which acts as a dispatcher to different sites registered to this revenue chain.

These sites could be used by attackers to offer commercial services that aim to increase
traffic for their customers, but this traffic is generated in an illegal way by compromising
websites. The sites could host also fraudulent pages which pretend to download suspicious
stuff (i.e. Toolbars, browser extensions or fake antivirus) or steal sensitive data (i.e. credit
card information).
In order to increase the visibility of the web, the compromised sites must have a good pagerank on search engines. So, the malware performs SEO Poisoning by leveraging on wordlist
containing the trending searched words
The population of the compromised site with the wordlists and their relative query results is
triggered contacting the main PHP using a specific User-Agent on a path
“{malw_name}/{malw_name}.php?vm={keyword}”.
Researchers from CSE CybSec ZLab discovered roughly 18.100 compromised websites.
While researchers were analyzing the EvilTraffic malvertising campaign, they realized that
most of the compromised websites used in the first weeks of the attacks have been cleaned
up in the last days. just in one week, the number of compromised websites dropped from
around 35k to 18k.
According to Alexa Traffic Rank, hitcpm.com is ranked number 132 in the world
and 0.2367% of global Internet users visit it. Below are reported some traffic statistics related
to hitcpm.com provided by hypestat.com

The analysis of the traffic shows an exponential increase in the traffic during October 2017.
Experts discovered that crooks behind the Operation EvilTraffic used a malicious software to
hijack traffic, it acts as brows a browser hijacker. The malware is distributed via various
methods, such as:
Attachment of junk mail
Downloading freeware program via unreliable site
Open torrent files and click on malicious links
By playing online games
By visiting compromised websites

3/6

The main purpose of the malware is to hijack web browsers changing browser settings such
as DNS, settings, homepage etc. in order to redirect as more traffic as possible to the
dispatcher site.
Further technical details about this campaign, including IoCs, are available in the report
titled:

campaign”
