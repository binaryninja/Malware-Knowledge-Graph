Overview
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine released an advisory on March 22,
2022 disclosing another wiper dubbed "DoubleZero" targeting Ukrainian enterprises during
Russia's invasion of the country. This wiper was detected as early as March 17, 2022.
DoubleZero is yet another wiper discovered in addition to previously disclosed attacks we've
seen in Ukraine over the past two months, such as "CaddyWiper" "HermeticWiper" and
"WhisperGate."
DoubleZero is a .NET-based implant that destroys files, registry keys and trees on the
infected endpoint.
Cisco Talos is actively conducting analysis to confirm the details included in these reports.

Wiper analysis
1/6

The malware first checks if the current endpoint is one of the domain's controllers. If the
endpoint's name is found, the wiper simply stops executing.
The wiper begins by obtaining the following privileges on the endpoint:
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
SeRestorePrivilege
SeBackupPrivilege
SeShutdownPrivilege
It aims to overwrite all files in all drives by destroying all files in all drives except for a specific
list of the locations hardcoded in the wiper. The malware intends to destroy non-system files
first, then system-related files. Destroying system related files while the overwriting of other
files is pending can create instability and may lead to bricking the system before the
complete destruction of the user's files is completed. In such cases, it may be possible to
recover the files from the disk that haven't been overwritten yet.
The system folders reserved for destruction *after* all other files have been destroyed:
<Root_drive>\Windows\Microsoft.NET
<Root_drive>\Windows
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\Local Settings.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Application Data.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\Start Menu.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\Application Data.*
<Root_drive>\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft.*
<Root_drive>\Documents and Settings
<Root_drive>\ProgramData\Application Data
<Root_drive>\Users\All Users
<Root_drive>\Users\Default User
<Root_drive>\system\drivers
<Root_drive>\Windows\NTDS
The wiper will enumerate all file paths and decide if the file is "safe" to destroy immediately
i.e., not a system file.
For each file that is deemed "safe" to destroy (i.e., not in the exclusions listed above), the
wiper will:
Change the access control of files by giving the Local System Account
(WellKnownSidType.LocalSystemSid) full control of the file.
Use one of the two wiper functions to destroy the files.
2/6

Wiper function No. 1
This routine will use APIs such as NtfsControlFile with a control code of
FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA (0x980C8) to fill up the file with all zero bytes.

NtfsControlFile used against a file to zero it out.

Wiper function No. 2
The second routine used to overwrite the files is relatively simpler. It opens the target file as
a FileStream and simply overwrites it with an array containing all zeros.

File being overwritten by an array containing all zeros.
Then the wiper moves on to the destruction of system files which is also carried out by the
two wiper functions illustrated above. The order of destruction of the system files is:
First:
<Root_drive>\system\drivers

Second:
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\Local Settings.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Application Data.*
<Root_drive>\Windows\NTDS
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft.*
<Root_drive>\\Users\\\\.*?\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft.*
Third:
<Root_drive>\Windows
The wiper then proceeds to destroy entries in the registry hives:
HKLM
HKCU
HKU

3/6

It will first kill all processes on the system named "lsass". Then, it will set the current user as
the owner of the registry keys under these hives, change the access rights to get full control
of the reg keys and then overwrite the values. The wiper will also delete subkey trees
recursively.

Once all the destructive activity has been completed, the wiper will then shutdown the
system using the ExitWindowsEx API call.
