ESET has analyzed two variants of the yty malware framework: Gedit and
DarkMusical. ESET researchers have decided to call one of the variants DarkMusical
because many of the names the attackers chose for their files and folders are inspired
by the movie High School Musical.
These attacks are focused on government and military organizations, Ministries of
Foreign Affairs, and embassies and are motivated by cyberespionage.
Targets are primarily located in South Asia – Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
Nepal. However, targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the
Middle East, Europe, North America, and Latin America, has been observed.
ESET’s investigation spans more than a year from September 2020 to October 2021.
A recent report by Amnesty International links the group’s malware to an Indian
cybersecurity company that may be selling the spyware.
The group has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two
years and it’s possible that the attackers have compromised the email accounts of
some of their victims.
BRATISLAVA, MONTREAL — January 18, 2022 — ESET researchers have uncovered
recent campaigns and an updated threat arsenal of the infamous APT group Donot Team
(also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02). According to research findings, the group is very
persistent and has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two
years. For this research, ESET monitored Donot Team for more than a year from September
2020 to October 2021. According to ESET telemetry, the APT group focuses on a small
number of targets primarily in South Asia — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal.
However, targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the Middle East,
Europe, North America, and Latin America, is not outside the group’s realm. These attacks
are focused on government and military organizations, Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and
embassies and are motivated by cyberespionage.
Donot Team is a threat actor operating since at least 2016 that is known for targeting
organizations and individuals in South Asia with Windows and Android malware. A recent
report by Amnesty International links the group’s malware to an Indian cybersecurity
company that may be selling the spyware or offering a hackers-for-hire service to
governments of the region.

“We have been closely following the activities of Donot Team, and have traced several
campaigns that leverage Windows malware derived from the group’s signature yty malware
framework,” says ESET researcher Facundo Muñoz, who led the investigation into the
group’s activities.
The main purpose of the “yty” malware framework is to collect and exfiltrate data. The
malicious framework consists of a chain of downloaders that ultimately download a backdoor
with minimal functionality, used to download and execute further components of Donot
Team’s toolset. These include file collectors based on file extension and year of creation,
screen capturers, keyloggers, reverse shells, and more.
Countries targeted in recent Donot Team campaigns

According to ESET telemetry, Donot Team has been consistently targeting the same entities
with waves of spearphishing emails every two to four months. The spearphishing emails
have malicious Microsoft Office documents attached that the attackers use to deploy their
malware.
Interestingly, the emails that ESET researchers were able to retrieve and analyze did not
show signs of spoofing. “Some emails were sent from the same organizations that were
being attacked. It’s possible that the attackers may have compromised the email accounts of
some of their victims in earlier campaigns, or the email server used by those organizations,”
says Muñoz.
In the latest blogpost, ESET has analyzed two variants of the yty malware framework: Gedit
and DarkMusical. ESET researchers have decided to call one of the variants DarkMusical
because of the names the attackers chose for their files and folders: many are western
celebrities or characters in the movie High School Musical. This variant was used in
campaigns targeting military organizations in Bangladesh and Nepal.
