A FortiGuard SE Team Threat Analysis Report
On Feb 5th, 2019, the FortiGuard SE team discovered a targeted attack aimed at an
unknown individual working for a government department in Queensland State in Australia.
Within a span of a few days, we had observed additional activity targeting various members
of this organization, specifically in the form of spearphishing attacks. We can safely surmise
that it is very likely that this threat was specifically targeting this organization at this time for
reasons unknown to us.
The threat being delivered is known as DanaBot. It is a modular banking Trojan that has
been historically linked to combining operations with other malware operators, such as those
behind Gootkit. Other modules associated with DanaBot include remote desktop through
VNC, information stealing, and keylogging. While it appears that this recent attack may be
looking to establish a foothold in the network, the reasons behind this are currently unknown.
Following the Attack Chain
The attack begins with a seemingly innocuous email:
As can be seen, this email was sent in early February through a legitimate free email service
available to everyone. In addition, the sender has not been registered as a spam-related
email address, which adds to the analysis that this is a specifically targeted attack.
The link in the email (hxxp://users.xxxx.com.au/soniamatas/9302030002_993.zip?33505757)
also points to an ISP that offers file hosting services.
Based on our telemetry for this server, the DanaBot authors’ method of operation appears to
be concentrated in Australia. In this most recent case, it is focused on a .gov.au email
address, which coincides with this latest attack.
The link leads to a zip archive that contains a single .VBS file. Once deobfuscated, a shortcut
link to a popular website is created in the temp folder, and after that, the script downloads a
file from hxxp://corp.invest.preferredweb.org/dMJbnufMVu.php into the same temp folder and
names it as inv.exe.
This domain has seen a recent surge in activity:

1/6

Also, most of the visitors come from Australia.
The domain itself was recently registered (February 03), as can be observed in the
screenshot below.
Data shows that while the server was registered through a registrar in the United States, it
was ultimately hosted by what appears to be a Russian webhosting service, as evidenced by
the Russian name servers.
It’s clear that the DanaBot authors also follow basic operational security practices, as
indicated by their low visitor numbers. Aside from sending targeted emails, they also prevent
anyone outside of Australia from downloading the malware. This may be in hopes of
preventing security researchers, law enforcement agencies, and other curious onlookers
from finding their campaigns.
In addition, the threat first contacts certain IP addresses to check for a valid Internet
connection. This is a failsafe system for the malware in the very case of it’s being analyzed
(i.e. sandbox/isolated network) to avoid and thwart further analysis. If there is no connection,
the threat will not continue to run.
Upon initiation, Danabot connects to a variety of benign IP addresses belonging to seemingly
randomly-selected organizations to see if it is online. Other IP addresses not known to be
Danabot C2 were not investigated due to time constraints, as well the difficulty of analyzing
banking Trojans in the allocated timeframe before publication.
A New Attack?
During the time of our initial analysis, as early as in the first week of February, the threat itself
was completely new. Interestingly, the recorded compilation time of the threat was actually
ahead of the time it was downloaded. This suggests that it is most likely because the threat
was compiled in a time zone ahead of the United States.
The threat can also create a service for persistence purposes, as well as build custom
directories and files to hold collect data. The threat can also inject malware into other
processes, such as winlogon.exe, explorer.exe, and svchost.exe. Functionality on older
systems include rootkit capabilities, including the ability to hide newly created services along
with the directories the threat uses.
Using a custom tool to reveal hidden services yields the following.
As mentioned, because of the embedded rootkit, browsing the folder does not reveal
anything.
However, if the folder name is known, it is possible to manually navigate to the DanaBot
directory.

DanaBot Modularity
Because of its modularity, DanaBot is known to install different modules, such as a remote
desktop through VNC, information stealing, keylogging, and as expected, injecting malware
into banking web pages, which ultimately makes it one of the more advanced and evolved
banking Trojans.

Initial Access: FortiMail or other mail solutions can be used to block specific file types.
FortiMail can also be configured to send attachments to the FortiSandbox solution (ATP)
either on-premise or in the cloud to determine if a file displays malicious behavior. FortiGate
firewalls with Anti-Virus enabled alongside a valid subscription will detect and block this
threat if configured to do so.
Execution: User Awareness Training – Since it has been observed that this threat has been
delivered via spearphishing distribution mechanisms, it is crucial that end users within an
organization are made aware of various types of attacks delivered via this method. This can
be accomplished through regularly occurring training sessions and impromptu tests using
predetermined templates by internal security departments within an organization. Simple
user awareness training on how to spot emails with malicious attachments or links could stop
the initial access into the network. If user awareness training fails, and the user opens the
attachment or link, FortiClient running with the latest up to date virus signatures will detect
and block files associated with this threat. The files analyzed in this report are detected as
VBS/Agent.QQN!tr.dldr, W32/Generic.AC.4399AE!tr, W32/Danabot.I!tr.
Exfiltration & C&C: FortiGates located in all your ingress and egress points with the Web
Filtering service enabled and up-to-date definitions and or Botnet Security will detect and
block any observable outbound connections if configured correctly.
It is important to note that attacks continue to become more sophisticated and can
sometimes circumvent your security defenses for a number of reasons. This is why it is
important to ensure you have the ability to detect anomalous activity that could be malicious.
Lastly, our Enterprise Bundle will address this attack as well as others. Our Enterprise
Bundle consolidates all the cyber security services you need to protect and defend against
all the cyber-attack channels from the endpoint to the cloud, including IoT devices, providing
you the integrated defense to tackle today’s advanced threats. Including the technologies
needed to address today's challenging risk, compliance, management, and visibility and
Operational Security (OT) concerns.
Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs)
DanaBot only contacts the IP addresses listed below to determine its online status. These
addresses appear to have been selected randomly, and it is important to emphasize that
there is no indication of any vulnerabilities or exploits associated with these addresses or the
DanaBot malware whatsoever. However, by identifying some or all of this list of addresses in
your outbound records, you could potentially validate whether or not your organization have
been infected by this malware.
