Steal, then strike: Access merchants are first clues to
future ransomware attacks

Cybercrime does not happen in a vacuum.
While ransomware variants like REvil, Ryuk and DoppelPaymer have become household
names for cybersecurity professionals, those deploying ransomware only represent part of
the process by which criminals are forcing organizations to either pay them millions or watch
their business go under.
The broader picture shows an underground marketplace that is increasingly becoming more
organized, borrowing best practices from legitimate businesses that understand the
importance of resiliency, efficiency and return on investment. A key cog in this growing
operation is the interdependency between those who specialize in selling access to
compromised systems or stolen information, and those looking to launch ransomware
attacks.
Data gathered by Intel 471 points to a pattern in numerous ransomware attacks that have
occurred in the past 18 months: Criminals in underground forums will advertise access to
various breached organizations, and quickly turn to sell access to the highest bidder or strike
a deal with an ransomware affiliate in order to share in any profits pulled from a successful
payment. These partnerships have resulted in a flourishing submarket, where access to
corporate networks is sold for six-figure sums directly or via a partnership and cut of paid
ransoms.
The compromised credentials are mostly obtained through attackers abusing flaws or
security shortcomings in virtual private networks or remote desktop protocol endpoints,
which provides the initial entry point into enterprise networks. Additionally, credential
information can come from logs tied to infostealer malware, password spraying or other
credential marketplaces in the criminal underground.
Instances show that anywhere from one week to six months after access is obtained and
advertised, other known actors on various underground forums look to use or purchase that
access to launch ransomware attacks. The targets run the gamut of regions and economic
sectors, with the pattern playing out in ransomware attacks on every continent.
One of the highest-profile ransomware attacks to fit this pattern was the attack on Pemex, the
state-run oil company based in Mexico. In November 2019, attackers hit Pemex with
DoppelPaymer, demanding $4.5 million in bitcoin to decrypt and return the files.

Intelligence from Intel 471 found that beginning in June 2019, a separate actor was
advertising access to 1,500 Pemex servers and personal computers, as well as administrator
privileges to the company’s domains, for $150,000. That transaction was facilitated through
a third-party escrow service, which allows criminals to move money in order to shield
themselves from making direct contact with the actors who are carrying out the crimes.
Another actor Intel 471 had been tracking started asking for access to ransomware-as-aservice affiliate programs, stating that deployment of ransomware on compromised networks
should potentially return much more money than just selling the access. Days after this,
Intel471 learned the actor obtained and modified a version of Thanos, and allegedly deployed
it against U.S. businesses. Over the past three months, this actor has frequently tried to sell
access to compromised organizations, which range in location, size, and economic sector.
Access merchant partnerships are not exclusive to any one particular ransomware variant or
ransomware-as-a-service. Data from Intel 471 shows this pattern following attacks carried
out with popular ransomware variants, such as DoppelPaymer, Maze, Netwalker, Ryuk and
REvil, as well as lesser-known variants like LockBit, Nefilim, Pysa and Thanos.
The astronomical growth in ransom payments in 2020 has helped access merchants put a
premium on their services. In years past, a large ransom payout would earn attackers
somewhere between five- and six-figure sums. Now, it’s becoming increasingly common for
attackers to demand seven- and eight-figure ransoms, partly due to the need to pay off actors
that have helped them obtain access to the victim’s system.
One such attack drives home this point: Intel 471 obtained a chat log from a ransomware
attack launched last month where a company — a U.S.-based healthcare provider — offered
to pay a ransom of just under $400,000. Despite the company’s quick response, the
ransomware crew was insulted by the offer and threatened to dump the entire cache of stolen
documents unless the figure was pushed several million dollars higher. With their backs
against the wall, the company eventually settled to pay $2 million in bitcoin.
How long ransomware crews decide to stay with this partnership model will be something to
watch in the coming year. Intel 471 has observed actions in underground marketplaces that
show RaaS groups are beginning to undercut access merchants, by either purchasing their
own credential-stealing malware or recruiting teams that specialize in obtaining access. Use
of access merchants may not disappear completely, but the extent of their popularity could
diminish.
To prevent being a victim, enterprises need to have continuous and proactive observation of
the cybercriminal underground marketplace where these interdependent products, services
and goods intersect. Additionally, ensuring token-based multi-factor authentication is
enabled across an enterprise and scrutinizing all internet-facing remote network connections
like RDP can be vital in preventing ransomware attacks.
