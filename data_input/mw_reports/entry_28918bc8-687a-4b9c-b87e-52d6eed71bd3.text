CSSP Year-in-Review - FY 2011

Accomplishments
In FY 2011, CSSP continued to move forward and grow
as a program. By providing increased support to the
vendors, owners, and operators of critical infrastructure, the
program continued to work toward a safer and more secure
tomorrow by accomplishing several key tasks:

3

• Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) Version 4 .0 was
released in August 2011 with
over I , 1S 0 CSETs being distributed in FY 2 0 I I .
• The CSET tool is now downloadable from the
CSSP website.

• ICS-CERT fly-away teams were deployed to seven
organizations over the fiscal year (FY).

• In FY 2 0 1 I , over 7S CSET onsite assessments
were completed.

• Approximately 600 participants attended the Fall 2010
and Spring 2011 ICSJWG Conferences with over 200
scheduled to attend the Fall 2011 ICSJWG.

• Over 40 training courses have been conducted domesti­
cally and internationally for public and private partners
with over 1,300 attendees.

• The ICSJWG Cross-Sector Roadmap Document
was finalized.

• CSSP provided more than a I 00 situational awareness
briefings and presentations at stakeholder meetings
and conferences.

Industrial Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT)
The ICS-CERT provides cyber incident response, analysis, and
information sharing to address the cybersecurity threats and
vulnerabilities unique to industrial control systems (ICS). For
example, this capability provides onsite and remote incident
response services for a variety of cyber threats ranging from
general malicious code infections to advanced persistent
threat (APT) intrusions.
The response team also produces alerts and advisories to
warn of vulnerabilities and to recommend mitigations and
best practices for securing ICS and the workplace. ICS-CERT
does this in partnership with private sector organizations and
Information Sharing and Analysis Centers in order to coor­
dinate and leverage cybersecurity efforts across all 18 critical
infrastructure sectors.
A technical analysis and malware lab enables the ICS-CERT
to provide analysis of vulnerabilities and malware threats
to control system environments.The team is able to verify

CSSP Yea r- i n - Revi ew — FY 2011

vulnerabilities for researchers and vendors, perform impact
analysis, and provide patch validation and testing prior to
deployment to the asset-owner community.
Another service the program offers asset owners is no-cost
onsite assistance and offsite analysis to support discovery,
forensics analysis, and recovery efforts associated with a
cybersecurity event (incident) focused on control environ­
ments within critical infrastructure. Onsite assistance consists
of a fly-away team being made available to deploy onsite to
review affected entities’ network architectures, collect appli­
cable forensic data, assist with immediate mitigation efforts
when appropriate, and work with the stakeholder to identify
future defense strategies. Offsite services include providing
analytical findings, including determination of origin and
breadth and depth of compromise from data captured during
the onsite deployment to the customer.

ICS-CERT key accomplishments for
FY 2011 include:
ICS-CERT deployed onsite incident response fly-away teams
to seven critical infrastructure organizations to assist with
analysis and recovery efforts of a cyber incident.
As part of the information sharing mission, ICS-CERT
published over 100 security alerts and advisories to the ICS
community warning of various threats and vulnerabilities
impacting control systems.
Vulnerability analysis and coordination rose a staggering
600% in FY 2011, with researchers utilizing ICS-CERT as a
conduit to vendors in the ICS space.
Reported cyber incidents were also up over 200% from
FY 2010 with more asset owners and operators contacting
ICS-CERT for support during a cyber event.

Cybersecurity Assessments
CSSP offers the CSET, a DHS product that assists organiza­
tions in protecting their key national cyber assets.This tool
provides users with a systematic and repeatable approach
for assessing the security posture of their cyber systems
and networks against recognized industry and government
standards, guidelines, and practices. It includes both highlevel and detailed questions related to all industrial control
and IT systems, regardless of sector. CSET generates both
interactive (on-screen) and printed reports that provide a
summary of security level gaps or areas that do not meet the
recommendations of the selected standards.These reports
can be used to help an organization plan and prioritize
mitigation strategies. Organizations who wish to conduct a
self assessment can download CSET from the CSSP website.
Over 1,150 copies of the tool were distributed in FY 2011.

In addition to the CSET, CSSP also offers onsite training
and guidance to asset owners in using CSET during onsite
assessments. These assessments are conducted at no cost
to the asset owners. This “over-the-shoulder” training and
guidance is provided to assist asset owners in using the tool
to better understand their control systems cybersecurity
posture.
In FY 2011, CSSP conducted over 75 assessments across
the sectors. For information on the CSET or to download
the tool, visit the website at:

Cybersecurity Training

Vendor Assessments

CSSP offers several training programs including Introductory,
Intermediate, and Advanced Control Systems Security classes.
These classes are offered at no cost to ICS professionals
and managers across all sectors of CIKR. In FY 2011, over
40 training sessions were provided consisting of over 20
Introductory, 8 Intermediate, and 10 Advanced ICS classes.

The Vendor Assessments effort focuses on vulnerabilities in
specific vendor equipment/software where CSSP analyzes the
potential impacts of emerging exploits in various ICS environ­
ments. CSSP completed assessments of several systems in FY
2011 and provided findings and recommendations to system
vendors for consideration and action.The ICS-CERT leveraged
these discoveries to issue alerts and guiding principles to the
ICS stakeholder community to identify, mitigate, and reduce
the security risks.

In April of 2011, CSSP released a new Management Level
Training Course that provides managers with a high-level
overview of control systems security.

Path Forward
The evolution of industrial control systems, as well as
threats to those systems, requires CSSP and ICS-CERT to
continue evolving to meet the needs of owners, vendors,
and operators. It is our goal to assist in providing the
stakeholder community with the tools and services required
to securely operate those systems that the nation’s critical
infrastructures rely apon daily.

In addition to providing onsite assessments, CSSP will
continue to focus on support for standards development
organizations and release upgrades to the CSET tool. This
tool is for use across the control systems community,
including public and private sector partners, to increase
situational awareness for cybersecurity status and improve
the health of CIKR stakeholders’ control systems.

Goals in the upcoming year include strengthening the
incident response capability and providing continued
onsite incident response teams to assist CIKR owners and
operators with investigation and remediation of damages
following a cyber incident on industrial control systems.
Supporting this, improvements will also be made to
malware analysis capabilities.

CSSP plans to revise the Strategy to Secure Control Systems.
The program will promote and maintain the CSSP website
as a central repository for control systems cybersecurity
information, vulnerability reporting, and cross-sector
information sharing for public and private sector partners.
CSSP also will continue industrial systems security support
to the NCCIC and is dedicated to maintaining our position
as a world class leader in control systems security.
