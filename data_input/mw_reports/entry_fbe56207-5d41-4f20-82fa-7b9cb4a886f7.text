Threat actors are actively scanning the Internet for open SSH devices and trying to login to
them using a new recently patched Zyxel hardcoded credential backdoor.
Last month, Niels Teusink of Dutch cybersecurity firm EYE disclosed a secret hardcoded
backdoor account in Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. This secret 'zyfwp' account allowed
users to login via SSH and the web interface to gain administrator privileges.
In an advisory, Zyxel states that they used the secret account to deliver firmware updates
via FTP automatically.
This backdoor is a significant risk as it could allow threat actors to create VPN accounts to
gain access to internal networks or port forward Internal services to make them remotely
accessible and exploitable.

Yesterday, cybersecurity intelligence firm GreyNoise detected three different IP addresses
actively scanning for SSH devices and attempting to login to them using the Zyxel backdoor
credentials.

IP address scanning for Zyxel SSH backdoor
GreyNoise CEO Andrew Morris told BleepingComputer that the threat actor does not
appear to be scanning specifically for Zyxel devices but is instead scanning the Internet for
IP addresses running SSH.
When SSH is detected, it will attempt to brute force an account on the device, with one of
the credentials tested being the new Zyxel 'zyfwp' backdoor account.
Of particular interest is that one of the IP addresses is using the built-in SSH client of Cobalt
Strike to perform the scans. Morris told BleepingComputer that the actor might be scanning
this way to evade threat intelligence vendors.
Since May of this year, GreyNoise has observed an unknown actor quietly
fingerprinting SSH honeypots on the Internet, exclusively through Tor. The actor is
using Cobalt Strike's SSH client. This is likely being done to avoid threat intelligence
vendors.https://t.co/UUN9VCuyfG pic.twitter.com/vGxInpR84M

Zyxel released the 'ZLD V4.60 Patch 1' last month that removes the backdoor accounts on
firewall devices. Zyxel announced yesterday that they would release the patch for
AP controllers on January 8th, 2021.
BleepingComputer strongly recommends that all users install the patch as soon as possible
to prevent threat actors from gaining access to vulnerable networks, deploying ransomware,
or stealing data.
