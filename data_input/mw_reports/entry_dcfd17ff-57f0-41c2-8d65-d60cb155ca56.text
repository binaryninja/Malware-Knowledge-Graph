ESET researchers analyzed three malicious applications targeting customers of eight Malaysian banks
The popularity of online shopping has been growing during the past few years, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. To make this already
convenient way of never having to leave the couch to buy new things even more convenient, people are increasingly using their smartphones
instead of computers to shop: in Q1 2021, smartphones accounted for 69% of all retail website visits worldwide, and smartphone purchases
made up 57% of online shopping orders. A noteworthy aspect of buying goods and services via a mobile device is that 53% of smartphone
users do it from vendor-specific applications.
Seeking the opportunity to make a profit off this behavior, cybercriminals exploit it by tricking eager shoppers into downloading malicious
applications. In an ongoing campaign targeting the customers of eight Malaysian banks, threat actors are trying to steal banking credentials
by using fake websites that pose as legitimate services, sometimes outright copying the original. These websites use similar domain names
to the services they are impersonating the better to attract unsuspecting victims.

Campaign overview
This campaign was first identified at the end of 2021, with the attackers impersonating the legitimate cleaning service Maid4u. Distributed
through Facebook ads, the campaign tempts potential victims to download Android malware from a malicious website. It is still ongoing as of
the publication of this blogpost, with even more distribution domains registered after its discovery. In January 2022, MalwareHunterTeam
shared three more malicious websites and Android trojans attributed to this campaign.

On top of that, ESET researchers found four more fake websites. All seven websites impersonated services that are only available in
Malaysia: six of them, Grabmaid, Maria’s Cleaning, Maid4u, YourMaid, Maideasy and MaidACall, offer cleaning services, and the seventh is a
pet store named PetsMore. The side-by-side comparison of the legitimate and copycat versions of Grabmaid and PetsMore can be seen in
Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

The copycat websites do not provide an option to shop directly through them. Instead, they include buttons that claim to download apps from
Google Play. However, clicking these buttons does not actually lead to the Google Play store, but to servers under the threat actors’ control.
To succeed, this attack requires the intended victims to enable the non-default “Install unknown apps” option on their devices. Interestingly,
five of the seven legitimate versions of these services do not even have an app available on Google Play.
To appear legitimate, the applications ask the users to sign in after starting them up; there is however no account validation on the server side
– the software takes any input from the user and always declares it correct. Keeping up the appearance of an actual e-shop, the malicious
applications pretend to offer goods and services for purchase while matching the interface of the original stores (see Figure 3 for a screenshot
of the shopping cart in one of the malicious apps). When the time comes to pay for the order, the victims are presented with payment options
– they can pay either by credit card or by transferring the required amount from their bank accounts. During our research, it was not possible
to pick the credit card option.

As we already mentioned, the goal of the malware operators is to obtain the banking credentials of their victims. After picking the direct
transfer option, victims are presented a fake FPX payment page and asked to choose their bank out of the eight Malaysian banks provided,
and then enter their credentials. The targeted banks are Maybank, Affin Bank, Public Bank Berhad, CIMB bank, BSN, RHB, Bank Islam
Malaysia, and Hong Leong Bank, as seen in Figure 4.

After unfortunate victims submit their banking credentials, they receive an error message informing them that the user ID or password they
provided was invalid (Figure 5). At this point, the entered credentials have been sent to the malware operators, as Figure 6 shows.

To make sure the threat actors can get into their victims’ bank accounts, the fake e-shop applications also forward all SMS messages
received by the victim to the operators in case they contain Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) codes sent by the bank (see Figure 7).

Malware description
The observed malware is rather minimalistic: it is designed to request only one user permission, which is to read received SMS messages. Its
goal is to phish for banking credentials and forward 2FA SMS messages from the compromised device to the operators. Lacking the
functionality to remove SMS messages from the device, the malware cannot hide that somebody is trying to get into the victim’s bank
account.
So far, the malware has been targeting only Malaysia – both the e-shops it impersonates and the banks whose customers’ credentials it is
after are Malaysian, and the prices in the applications are all displayed in the local currency, the Malaysian Ringgit.
One of the services impersonated in the campaign, MaidACall, has already warned its users of this fraudulent campaign via a Facebook post
(see Figure 8). The rest have not publicly commented on the issue yet.

We have found the same malicious code in all three analyzed applications, leading us to conclude that they can all be attributed to the same
threat actor.

Takeaways
To protect yourself against this type of threat, first, try to ensure that you are using legitimate websites to shop:
Verify if the website is secure, i.e., its URL begins with https://. Some browsers might even refuse to open non-HTTPS websites and
explicitly warn users or provide an option to enable HTTPS-only mode.
Be wary of clicking ads and do not follow paid search engine results: it is possible that they do not lead to the official website
Apart from looking out for fake websites, here are some other useful tips to enjoy a safer online shopping experience on your smartphone:
Pay attention to the source of applications you are downloading. Make sure that you are actually redirected to the Google Play store
when getting an application
Use software or hardware 2FA instead of SMS when possible
Use mobile security solutions to detect harmful websites and malicious apps

Conclusion
The observed campaign is a fake e-shop scheme targeting the banking credentials of Android users in Malaysia. It exploits the popularity of
using smartphones to shop online. Instead of phishing for banking credentials on websites, the threat actors have introduced Android
applications into the chain of compromise, thus making sure they have access to 2FA SMS messages the victim is likely to receive. The
scheme relies on using ads to lure potential victims into accessing copycat versions of legitimate websites. Once there, a fake Google Play
download button directs them towards a malicious application distributed by the malware operators via a third-party site.

8/11

While the campaign targets Malaysia exclusively for now, it might expand to other countries and banks later on. At this time, the attackers are
after banking credentials, but they may also enable the theft of credit card information in the future.
