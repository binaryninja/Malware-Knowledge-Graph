Threat Actor Profile: TA505, From Dridex to GlobeImposter

2/13

September 27, 2017 Proofpoint Staff
Overview
Proofpoint researchers track a wide range of threat actors involved in both financially
motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored actions. One of the more prolific actors that we
track - referred to as TA505 - is responsible for the largest malicious spam campaigns we
have ever observed, distributing instances of the Dridex banking Trojan, Locky ransomware,
Jaff ransomware, The Trick banking Trojan, and several others in very high volumes.
Because TA505 is such a significant part of the email threat landscape, this blog provides a
retrospective on the shifting malware, payloads, and campaigns associated with this actor.
We examine their use malware such as Jaff, Bart, and Rockloader that appear to be
exclusive to this group as well as more widely distributed malware like Dridex and Pony.
Where possible, we detail the affiliate models with which they are involved and outline the
current state of TA505 campaigns.
The infographic in Figure 1 traces the earliest known dates on which TA505 began
distributing particular malware strains, beginning with Dridex in 2014 and most recently when
they elevated GlobeImposter and Philadelphia from small, regionally targeted ransomware
variants to global threats.

Figure 1: Timeline of TA505 malware introductions
Of note is TA505’s use of the Necurs botnet [1] to drive their massive spam campaigns. As
we saw in both 2016 and 2017, disruptions to Necurs went hand-in-hand with quiet periods
from TA505. When the botnet came back online, TA505 campaigns quickly returned [2],
usually at even greater scale than before the disruption.
The following is a more detailed description of the malware and notable campaign attributes
associated with TA505.
Dridex
The now infamous Dridex banking Trojan can trace much of its DNA to Cridex and Bugat [3].
Dridex itself appeared shortly after the Zeus banking Trojan was taken down. It was originally
documented [4] on July 25, 2014 (or June 22, 2014, according to Kaspersky [5]) and the first
campaign we observed in which TA505 distributed Dridex occurred three days later on July
28. Although a number of actors have distributed Dridex, TA505 operates multiple affiliate
IDs, including what appears to be the earliest recorded affiliate, botnet ID 125. These early
campaigns were distributed via the Lerspeng downloader while later campaigns occasionally
used Pony or Andromeda as intermediate loaders to distribute various instances of Dridex.
Although TA505 initially distributed Dridex botnet ID 125, they were observed using botnet ID
220 in March 2015 and botnet ID 223 in December of that year. Later, they were also
associated with botnet IDs 7200 and 7500. These botnets generally target the following
regions:
125: UK, US, and Canada
220: UK and Australia
223: Germany
7200: UK
7500: Australia
The group has routinely distributed the malware in larger campaigns than any other actor,
regularly spamming millions of recipients.

Trojan in 2014
TA505 continued distributing Dridex through early June 2017 using a range of email
attachments. Most recently these included PDF attachments with embedded Microsoft Word
documents bearing malicious macros that call PowerShell commands that install Dridex.
However, because of the length of time for which the group has been distributing Dridex,
distribution mechanisms trace the state of the art for the last two years of email campaigns
with techniques ranging from straight macro documents to a variety of zipped scripts.
Shifu
In October 2015, we observed several campaigns in which TA505 targeted Japanese and
UK organizations with the Shifu banking Trojan [6]. Shifu is relatively common in Japan but
was a new addition to TA505’s toolbox. It appears that they introduced Shifu after high-profile
law enforcement actions impacted Dridex distribution. However, TA505 was also among the
first actors to return to high-volume Dridex distribution this same month, even as they
demonstrated their ability to diversify and deliver threats beyond Dridex.
As with many of their other campaigns, TA505 delivered Shifu through macro-laden Microsoft
Office document attachments.
Locky

7/13

TA505 introduced Locky [7] ransomware in February 2016. After alternating for over four
months with Dridex, Locky became the payload of choice for TA505, eclipsing earlier
campaigns in terms of volume and reach. TA505 stopped distributing Dridex in July 2016,
relying almost exclusively on Locky through December of that year. Like Dridex, Locky is
also distributed in an affiliate model; TA505 exclusively distributes Locky Affid=3.

early 2016
Figure 4 shows the evolution of Dridex and Locky campaigns over the course of over two
years:
Low-volume campaigns distributed Dridex during much of 2015
Moderate volumes of Dridex appeared from the end of 2015 through February 2016; it
is worth noting that these “moderate volume” campaigns were, at the time, the largest
campaigns ever observed.
Alternating Dridex and Locky campaigns of varying volumes appeared through May
2016.

8/13

A lull in June 2016 [1] associated with a disruption in the Necurs botnet; TA505 is
heavily reliant on this massive botnet to send out high-volume malicious spam
campaigns and disappearances of TA505 activity frequently accompany disruptions in
Necurs.
Extremely high-volume campaigns distributing Locky exclusively in July 2016,
consistently delivering tens of millions of messages.
Another lull in November 2016 saw the complete absence of Locky and Dridex, while
high-volume campaigns reappeared in December, albeit at lower volumes than during
the Q3 2016 peak.
An expected break following the 2016-2017 winter holidays turned into an unexplained
three-month hiatus [8] for TA505.
Large-scale Dridex and Locky campaigns returned in Q2 2017, although none reached
the volumes we observed in mid-2016.
Later campaigns saw new attachment types, even as Dridex and Locky payloads
remained largely unchanged.
Locky distribution ceased in June and July but returned in August with volumes rivaling
the peaks of 2016.
TA505 turned to URLs in early August 2017 to distribute Locky, finally eschewing the
document or zipped-script attachments that have characterized the majority of their
Locky campaigns since February 2016; most of these URLs linked to malicious
documents and scripts.
By later August, TA505 had turned back to large attachment campaigns, primarily
distributing various zipped scripts that downloaded Locky. The group continued this
pattern with occasional URL campaigns and attached HTML files bearing malicious
links.

in early 2015
Rockloader
TA505 first introduced Rockloader [9] in April 2016 as an intermediate loader for Locky. At
that time, Rockloader was the initial payload downloaded by malicious attached JavaScript
files. Once Rockloader was installed, it downloaded Locky and, in some cases, Pony and
Kegotip. Pony is another loader with information stealing capabilities while Kegotip is an
credential and email address harvesting malware strain that would appear in a small number
of TA505 campaigns the following year as the primary payload.
Bart
Bart ransomware [10] appeared for exactly one day on June 24, 2016. It was a secondary
payload downloaded by Rockloader, the initial payload in a large email campaign using
zipped JavaScript attachments. The Bart ransom screen was visually similar to Locky’s but
Bart had one important distinction: it could encrypt files without contacting a command and
control server. However, we have not seen Bart since, suggesting that this was either an
experiment or that the ransomware did not function as expected for TA505.
Kegotip
TA505 briefly distributed the Kegotip information stealer in April 2017. Across two campaigns
of several million messages each, the actor used both macro-laden Microsoft Word
documents and zipped VBScript attachments to install the Trojan on potential victim PCs.
Kegotip is an infostealer (credentials and email addresses) used to facilitate other crimeware
activities. It steals credentials from various FTP clients, Outlook, and Internet Explorer. It also
will gather email addresses scraped from files stored on the computer. This information can
be used to facilitate future spam campaigns by the perpetrator or may be sold to other
actors.
Jaff
TA505 introduced Jaff ransomware [11] in May 2017. Jaff was not dramatically different from
other ransomware strains. The payment portal was initially similar to the one used by Locky
and Bart. It was primarily notable for its high-volume campaigns and its association with
TA505, given the actor’s propensity for massive campaigns and ability to dominate the email
landscape. Jaff appeared in multi-million message campaigns for roughly a month and then
promptly disappeared as soon as a decryptor was released in mid-June 2017.
The Trick

10/13

The Trick, also known as Trickbot, is another banking Trojan that TA505 first began
distributing in June of 2017, although we have observed The Trick in the wild since fall 2016,
usually in regionally targeted campaigns. It is generally considered a descendant of the
Dyreza banking Trojan and features mutliple modules. The main bot is responsible for
persistence, the downloading of additional modules, loading affiliate payloads, and loading
updates for the malware.
As with much of the malware distributed by TA505, The Trick has appeared in frequent, highvolume campaigns. The campaigns used a mix of attached zipped scripts (WSF, VBS),
malicious Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel), HTML attachments, passwordprotected Microsoft Word documents, links to malicious JavaScript, and other vectors. The
last TA505 campaigns featuring The Trick appeared in mid-September 2017 with payloads
alternating between Locky and The Trick.
Philadelphia
Philadelphia ransomware has been circulating since September 2016. It first attracted our
attention in April of this year [12] when we observed an actor customizing the malware for
use in highly targeted campaigns. In a brief stint, TA505 distributed it in one large campaign
in July, but we have not seen them use it since.
GlobeImposter
GlobeImposter is another ransomware strain that saw relatively small-scale distribution until
TA505 began including it in malicious spam campaigns at the end of July 2017. TA505
primarily distributed GlobeImposter in zipped script attachments through the beginning of
September 2017. Again, GlobeImposter is not particularly innovative but TA505 elevated the
ransomware from a regional variant to a major landscape feature during roughly six weeks of
large campaigns.
Conclusion
TA505 is arguably one of the most significant financially motivated threat actors because of
the extraordinary volumes of messages they send. The variety of malware delivered by the
group also demonstrates their deep connections to the underground malware scene. At the
time of writing, Locky ransomware remains their malware of choice, even as the group
continues to experiment with a variety of additional malware.
The history of TA505 is instructive because they
Have proven to be highly adaptable, shifting techniques and malware frequently to
“follow the money”, while largely sticking to successful strategies where possible
Are flexible, using largely interchangeable components, innovating where necessary on
the malware front and using off-the-shelf malware where possible

Operate at massive scale, consistently driving global trends in malware distribution and
message volume.
Each of these elements makes TA505 a magnifying lens through which to consider the
framework employed by many modern threat actors. Such a framework typically consists of
five elements:
1. Actor: The attacker organization; real humans driven by various motivations -- In the
case of TA505, the motivations are financial.
2. Vector: The delivery mechanism; email via attacker-controlled or leased spam botnet -Necurs for TA505 -- remains a dominant vector, and certainly the vector of choice for
this actor.
3. Hoster: The sites hosting malware; if malware is not directly attached to email, then
macro-enabled documents, malicious scripts, or exploit kits will pull payloads from
these servers. TA505 almost exclusively hosts malware in this way, although they vary
the means of installing their final payloads on victim machines.
4. Payload: The malware; software that will enable the attacker to make use of (control,
exfiltrate data from, or download more software to) the target computer. For TA505, the
payloads have shifted over the years and months of their activity, but their sending and
hosting infrastructure make these changes relatively simple to implement.
5. C&C: The command and control channel that serves to relay commands between the
installed malware and attackers. TA505 operates a variety of C&C servers, allowing it
to be resilient in the case of takedowns, sinkholes, and other defensive operations.
This framework enables attackers to operate in robust, horizontally segmented ecosystems,
specializing in developing certain parts of the framework, and selling or leasing to others;
such frameworks are resistant to takedowns and individual component failures. But such
frameworks also increase attackers' detection surface, that is, their susceptibility to
discovery. In the case of TA505, while most elements of the framework are well-developed,
their reliance on the Necurs botnet for the sending high-volume malicious spam - a key
component of the Vector element above - appears to be their Achilles heel.
By tracking each of these elements, defenders can infer other elements and take the
appropriate defensive measures. We will continue to track this actor, which, despite
significant occasional disruptions to their sending infrastructure, appears to be on track to
continue driving the majority of malicious email in the months to come.
