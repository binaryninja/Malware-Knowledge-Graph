Three Romanian men have been indicted in the US for allegedly operating a longstanding
fraud operation known as Bayrob that conned victims out of millions of dollars. Bogdan
Nicolescu (aka “Masterfraud”, aka “mf”); Danet Tiberiu (aka “Amightysa”, aka “amy”); and
Radu Miclaus (aka “Minolta”, aka “min”) were arrested by police in Romania earlier this year
before being extradited to the US, where they now face multiple charges relating to fraud,
identity theft, money laundering, and trafficking in counterfeit goods or services.
Our research shows that the Bayrob gang are career cybercriminals, earning a living from
online fraud. They specialize in detailed scams and go to great lengths to craft convincing
emails and create fake websites, voice messages, and even customer support chatrooms in
order to dupe victims.
The gang began its career running elaborate cons where it created fake vehicle auctions to
defraud victims out of tens of thousands of dollars. It later expanded and diversified with a
number of different fraud and malware operations, ranging from credit card theft to
cryptocurrency mining using infected computers.
The FBI believes that the Bayrob group has stolen at least US$4 million from victims over
the past eight years, though the actual total may be up to $35 million. It also established
that the group infected between 60,000 and 160,000 computers and sent out 11 million
malicious emails.
The arrests are the culmination of an eight-year law enforcement investigation which was
assisted by Symantec. During this time, Symantec discovered multiple versions of Bayrob
malware, collected helpful intelligence data, and witnessed Bayrob as it morphed from
online fraud to a 300,000+ botnet for cryptocurrency mining.
Symantec succeeded in exposing the gang’s operations, gaining insight into its key players,
tactics, malware, and the potential impact and criminal activity undertaken.

Elaborate car auction scams
Bayrob first came to our attention in 2007, when it was discovered operating a scam that
conned victims into believing they were buying a vehicle on eBay. Victims’ computers were
infected with custom designed malware (Trojan.Bayrob) which displayed fake eBay web
pages and misled users into thinking they were conducting a legitimate purchase on the
auction site.
The gang identified potential victims by listing vehicles for sale on a number of websites,
including eBay and classified advertising websites. It noted anyone who displayed an
interest in the sale, such as those who asked questions or put a bid on the vehicle. The
2/8

gang would then pretend that the sale had concluded but later email potential victims,
informing them that the sale had fallen through and asking if they were still interested.
Attached to these emails was a slideshow file, containing pictures of the vehicle supposedly
on sale. This file was infected with Trojan.Bayrob. If the victim opened it, the malware was
installed on their computer.

the Bayrob Trojan
Once the attackers verified that the Bayrob Trojan was running on a victim’s computer, they
moved on to the next stage of the scam by sending an email with what they claimed was a
link to a new auction for the vehicle. It was at this point that the Trojan came into play. If the
victim clicked on the link, it would redirect them to a fake eBay page. If they decided to buy
the vehicle, they were asked to pay by way of a bank transfer, which was routed to an
account that belonged to a money mule, who would in turn transfer the proceeds of the
fraud to the gang.

From the victim’s standpoint it appeared they were visiting a real eBay auction. However, if
the link was followed from an uninfected computer, there would be no such auction. The
gang went to great lengths to make the scam appear realistic. Its emails were composed in
fluent English and every iteration of the Bayrob Trojan was customized for its intended
victim. The fake eBay web pages even included fictitious feedback about the seller. The
Trojan was also capable of generating fake vehicle history reports, along with fake pages
from escrow and delivery services.
The fraud had a major impact on its victims, who often transferred thousands of dollars
thinking they were paying for a new car and ended up with nothing.

Exposure and expansion
Bayrob’s activities were initially exposed by Symantec in 2007, when we published a series
of blogs highlighting the eBay scam, and several media outlets reported on their activities.
The gang reacted angrily and, for a while, registered command and control (C&C) domain
names that contained abusive references to our researchers and made disparaging
references to Symantec in its code.

However, public attention didn’t deter the gang from further expanding and refining its
operations. For example, they created a fake trucking company, which was used to
supposedly transport purchased vehicles to their victims. The trucking company would first
inform the victim their vehicle was on the way and then later email them informing them of
delays. It even operated a phone line and fake voicemail service to appear more
convincing. The whole purpose of the fake trucking company was to string the victim along
for as long as possible in order to make sure the gang received the money before the victim
realized they’d been conned.

Network of money mules
In order to move the proceeds of its scams back to Romania, the gang recruited a wide
network of money mules. It found potential mules by spamming classified advertising
websites with fake job ads. Rather than the usual cybercriminal tactic of using “work from

5/8

home” ads, the Bayrob gang often copied legitimate job ads in order appear more
convincing. Those who responded were told that the job had been filled but were then
offered an alternative, work from home job.
As with its other operations, money mule recruitment was professionally executed and
backed up by a series of fake websites and convincing looking emails, such as one
purporting to offer the recipient a job with a technology company. Some victims were even
told they’d gotten a job with a fake Yahoo subsidiary called Yahoo Transfers.

Given that they would be handling the gang’s stolen money, mules were thoroughly vetted
during recruitment, using Google searches, instant messaging, and VoIP calls. The group
recruited mules on both sides of the Atlantic. Victims in the US were instructed to route
payments to a bank account controlled by a mule in the US. These in turn were asked to
transfer the money to another mule, usually in an Eastern European country. They would
then presumably transfer the money on to gang members.
Mules in the US were often vulnerable people in difficult circumstances. They appeared to
be unwitting pawns of the gang, unaware of what they’d become involved with. Less is
known about the money mules used in Europe, but most appeared to collect transferred
funds using fake identities, indicating they may have been more complicit in the gang’s
activities.

6/8

Mules in the US were given two options for payment. They could keep six percent of the
funds they transferred or they could send the entire amount and later receive a check for 10
percent of the total. The latter option was a scam and nobody who opted for it received any
payment from the gang. Despite putting these money mules at risk of arrest and
prosecution, the gang had no qualms about double crossing them and stealing from them
too.

Diversification of operations
Over time, the Bayrob gang expanded beyond its original auction fraud and into other areas
of cybercrime. The group began stealing credit card information from the users of infected
computers, using the stolen cards to finance the purchase of online infrastructure and
services that allowed it to grow its operations.
In recent years, the gang has concentrated on rapidly growing the number of infected
computers in order to build a botnet. When it was exclusively involved in auction fraud, the
number of infected computers was around 1,000 at any one time. However, by 2014 it had
jumped to approximately 50,000 and by mid-2016 it had grown to over 300,000 and
continued to grow.
One of the main purposes of this botnet appeared to be cryptocurrency mining. A large
number of infected computers provided the gang with the necessary processing power to
profit significantly from mining.

Breakthrough in the investigation
Since 2011, Symantec has managed to progressively uncover the gang’s network, gaining a
broad picture of its operations. The information generated by our investigation not only
helped us to improve our protections against the group’s malware, but also allowed us to
prevent future attacks and warn potential victims. What we learned assisted the FBI in its
investigation and we opted not to publish what we discovered in recent years until the FBI
investigation was concluded.
Bayrob employed a high degree of internal security. Their online communications involved
extensive use of encryption, with email encrypted using PGP and instant messaging
encrypted with the Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging protocol.
In order to cover its tracks, the gang hid behind a double layer of proxies, connecting first to
proxies in Romania and then to more proxies in the US. One of our most significant
breakthroughs came when we discovered a weak point in their use of these proxies. Due to
this weakness, the gang's malicious activities were exposed, allowing us to passively
observe its activities on computers Symantec was protecting.
Our investigation required time and patience. In one case, we observed the gang’s
malicious activities for a year and a half before it made an error that exposed one of its
7/8

suspected members. Over time we came to understand the group’s infrastructure which
helped us to get see more of the gang’s operations.
Symantec’s pursuit of Bayrob is one of many long standing investigations we currently have
underway, all of which are motivated by a desire to protect our customers. Today’s arrests
illustrate the value of effective co-operation between security companies and law
enforcement and sends a clear signal to international cybercrime gangs that they are not
beyond the reach of the justice system.

Protection
Symantec products use multiple layers over protection against Bayrob’s malware.
Protection has been continuously updated since 2007 to block against each new iteration of
the group’s malware.
Symantec and Norton products block Bayrob malware with the following detections:
Antivirus
Intrusion prevention system
In addition to this, a range of Symantec generic detections also successfully block Bayrob
malware. The addition of generic detections to our defense layer makes it more difficult for
attackers to identify which detections are designed to specifically block their malware,
making it hard to test against them.

Further information
Symantec has gathered full technical details and indicators of compromise for all Bayrob
malware variants discovered since 2007. This can be supplied to any member of the
information security community upon request.
