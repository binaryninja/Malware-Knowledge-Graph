Background
On 12 April 2022, the Ukrainian CERT and ESET disclosed the existence of Industroyer2, a
successor to the malware targeting Ukrainian electric distribution and transmission
operations in 2016. Industroyer2 arrived after multiple disruptive cyber incidents of varying
degrees of success surrounding Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, as presented in the
following timeline:
Overall, cyber operations targeting Ukraine have ranged from the “merely annoying” (DDoS)
to “quite concerning” (Industroyer2). Fully contextualizing events will take time and the
release of additional information, evidence, and technical background, although some

preliminary observations are possible. In the case of Industroyer, we have several mysteries
to contend with:

Leaked reporting indicating potentially successful disruptive events in mid-March, prior
to the known Industroyer2 compilation date, across multiple substations.

The overall timing of Industroyer2 events, well after the start of hostilities (and as
Russian performance continued to deteriorate across its invasion).
Reporting from Ukrainian authorities indicating attempted disruptive operations are
quite widespread and may even be ongoing after the Industroyer2 disclosure.
There are many threads to pull to evaluate the Industroyer2 incident, given limited reporting
but also the existence of samples in commercial malware repositories. While much remains
to be uncovered with events, sufficient information is available at this time to draw some
preliminary conclusions and set events in context with the current situation in Ukraine, as
well as previous operations.

Industroyer2 and Past Events
Industroyer2 represents the third (but presumably unsuccessful) electric power event
targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. The first such event took place in 2015, when three
distribution substations were targeted through a combination of direct interaction with
operator control systems and a “SCADA hijack” scenario to open breakers to disrupt the flow
of electricity. The disruption was quickly followed by a wiper deployed to operator
workstations, as well as disruption to control center Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)
systems and deploying a malicious firmware update to serial-to-ethernet devices to
effectively “brick” the systems. This also coincided with a DoS to utility telephone lines
inhibiting the ability of customers to report outages to operators.
The event resulted in an outage lasting several hours impacting over 200,000 customers.
Overall, the 2015 event appears to be a “success,” in terms of the capabilities deployed
resulting in an impact scenario commensurate with tools used. While Ukrainian operators
were able to restore operations relatively quickly by manually reclosing breakers, anecdotal
evidence indicates the system wiping and effective destruction of serial-to-ethernet
converters produced damage taking years to effectively correct.
The 2015 event was followed roughly a year later by another incident, this time using power
system-specific malware referred to as Industroyer or CRASHOVERRIDE. In 2016, a
transmission substation was targeted, providing for a potentially larger impact scenario than
the 2015 event. However, as detailed in analysis in 2019, the first Industroyer event appears
to have been very ambitious as an integrity- and protection-targeting industrial incident, but
also a failure due to various mistakes in designing and deploying tools for the (attempted)
disruption. Thus the 2016 event resulted in relatively less-significant impact than 2015,
largely due to errors on the part of the attackers.
Industroyer2 appears to have learned some lessons from the 2016 incident. As detailed in
public presentations, the IEC-104 manipulation module for the original Industroyer failed due
to programmatic errors and ignoring proper state change requirements for proper protocol
communication. Shown in the following packet capture, Industroyer2 appears to properly
implement the IEC-104 protocol in following appropriate state transitions. While findings are
3/9

preliminary and complete assessment would require testing on equipment similar to what
was targeted in victim environments, preliminary analysis would indicate the attackers paid
attention to past failures and implemented corrections in their code.

However, other aspects of Industroyer2 are significantly different than past incidents. While
several wipers are associated with Industroyer2’s deployment, preliminary analysis from
ESET and CERT-UA assesses this was likely for destroying intrusion artifacts and evidence,
with limited targeting of non-Windows systems that has not yet been thoroughly evaluated in
terms of impact and likely adversary intent. Lacking from this event are the sort of physically
destructive applications, such as the serial-to-ethernet converter targeting or the attempted
removal of line protection in 2016.
Given currently-available evidence, it would appear that the 2022 attempt, although
potentially of much wider scope (up to two million potentially impacted customers, based on
Ukrainian assessment), was also potentially less destructive than prior activity. Precisely why
this is the case is unknown. Some possibilities include:
1. Desire on the part of Russian decision-makers to enable relatively quick restoration of
the impacted sites as part of an invasion plan.
2. Inability to develop a suitable physical destruction capability for the targeted
substations in time for deployment because of a “rushed” decision-making process.
3. Failure to deploy a destructive capability because the attack was interrupted by
Ukrainian defenders before an impact could occur.
Each of these possibilities require more evidence to evaluate, although the first might be
possible to examine if the targeted sites were disclosed. For example, if the sites were tightly
correlated with Russian invasion lines of (attempted) advance, having a way to restore

4/9

electricity service but disrupting it during operations might make sense. The other two
possibilities will require information not likely to be available for some time in order to
properly assess.
In any case, Industroyer2 appears to represent both an advance from earlier operations, in
that industrial communication seems to be properly implemented, and a step back in terms of
hard-coded configurations (making each sample unique to its victim site) and lack of a postdisruption destructive element.

BlackEnergy3 Connections
One curious aspect of Industroyer2 concerns service names used during execution in
deployment. In analysis of non-public samples published by ESET and analysis of different
(but apparently functionally equivalent) samples in commercial malware repositories, the
following set of strings are present for targeting purposes:

While seemingly innocuous, those with good memories (or a bit of search engine skill) can
rapidly identify where this name – PService_PPD.exe – previously appeared: in past
reporting on BlackEnergy3 use in connection with the 2015 Ukraine power event.
While BlackEnergy3 is not “industrial-specific” in the same sense as either Industroyer
variant or other items such as Triton, it did serve a critical enabling function as part of the
overall attack sequence leading up to power disruption. The name has no other significance

5/9

or notable observations beyond this context.

Both ESET and CERT-UA link Industroyer2 (as well as the original Industroyer and at least
some of the wiper events in Ukraine in 2022) to the Sandworm actor, linked to GRU post
74455. Previous reporting and government disclosures also linked Sandworm to the 2015

6/9

power event, and the use of BlackEnergy3 malware. Re-use of a specific process name or
string would therefore appear to be a very strange mistake in operational security – or it
could represent some degree of “victim trolling” by threat actors.
The name itself has no significance or function beyond the BlackEnergy3-Industroyer2
connection. Why this appears is an open question, and likely one that will never be
satisfactorily resolved. However, this instance may be an interesting cyber threat intelligence
counter-example of where indicator-like alerting (e.g., on specific filenames or references to
specific processes) may actually be a reasonable defensive measure for identifying certain
adversaries.

Relationship to Wider Operations and Events
When Russia initiated its terrible invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, commentators
and analysis anticipated early operations to feature significant cyber components. While
some effects certainly were observed and others discovered after collection of more
evidence, many expected to observe critical infrastructure disruption along the lines of the
2015 and 2016 power events. That such an impact was attempted but only over a month into
the conflict seems exceptionally strange, and defies expectations and assumptions around
when to deploy such capabilities in conjunction with more traditional military operations.
First, while we cannot say this with complete confidence, it does appear that initial Russian
plans for invading Ukraine envisioned a relatively quick decapitation of national leadership
and centers of gravity, centered around the sack of Kyiv. As part of this operation, one can
assume that leaving critical infrastructure largely intact was probably an initial requirement to
facilitate occupation and subsequent installation of a puppet regime. As Russia’s
incompetence and Ukraine’s bravery stymied these plans, a noticeable shift to indiscriminate
attacks on population centers and infrastructure was observed. That a latent capability such
as power system-targeting malware would be unleashed after such initial aims failed may
therefore make sense, along the lines of similar questionable Russian decisions such as
using sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles to target stationary targets on land.
Changing war aims aside, at the start of the conflict Ukraine’s electric sector remained linked
to Russian grid operations. Coinciding with the start of Russia’s invasion, Ukrainian operators
initiated an isolation test from Russian grid operations, and subsequently decided to not
reconnect. While separating Ukraine from Russian grid operations, this also left Ukraine’s
grid isolated and thus more easily susceptible to disruption. Russian operations to capture
electric infrastructure, such as events in Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, could thus give Russia
ready control over Ukrainian electric operations, or at least significant influence over them.
This changed in mid-March, when Ukraine (and Moldova) successfully connected to the
European electric grid under ENTSO-E. As stated previously, this timing is interesting as
some suspected disruptive events appeared to take place immediately after this switchover.
But with Ukraine now part of the wider European electric system, unilateral options for
7/9

Russia to control or manipulate Ukrainian electric operations were removed, or significantly
reduced. Thus the timing of Industroyer2 after not just the start of the conflict, but also after
integration with ENTSO-E, makes more sense in light of these changes.

Conclusions
Many details surrounding Industroyer2 and related (attempted) attacks on Ukrainian electric
infrastructure are unavailable, but sufficient information has emerged to allow for the
preliminary observations above. Overall, the evolution of operations in Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine show that many assumptions surrounding the use of cyber capabilities as part of a
conventional conflict require revision – but at the same time, we should also note that cyber
has been far from absent as part of hostilities. While paling in comparison to Russia’s
physical brutality, cyber operations appear to form a continuing area of interest and
investment for Russia in attempting to achieve its goals in Ukraine.
With time and additional data, the items above can be revisited and improved. I would
caution anyone reading this, or any other, analysis that in the case of both the 2015 and
especially the 2016 power incidents in Ukraine, reasonably complete understanding of these
events did not occur until years after the events in question. Especially given the difficulties
of network defense, forensics, and electric system operations in the middle of an invasion,
researchers would do well to be patient with matters such as this, and maintain a willingness
to revise conclusions appropriately as more information emerges.
Overall, Industroyer2 represents an interesting and important development surrounding the
broader violence Russia is inflicting upon Ukraine. Given that the malware did not result in a
disruption of service, other asset owners and operators should take note that robust, alert
operations are critical in maintaining sufficient defense and resilience in the face of critical
infrastructure threats. We can learn much from Ukraine’s efforts in this conflict, not the least
of which being how to maintain fundamental civilian services even in the face of a brutal, allout assault.
