Background

Just about one year ago, the makers of the infamous GandCrab ransomware announced
their retirement, having reportedly earned an astonishing $2 billion since their entry into the
ransomware market in January 2018. The vacuum was quickly filled, however. Forensic and
malware evidence was soon discovered connecting GandCrab’s malware to a new
ransomware variant which was about to wreak havoc on a global scale: REvil.

REvil’s rise was rapid. It has victimized enterprises and municipal governments alike, having
claimed 12.5% of the ransomware market share as of Q2 2019. By mid-May of this year, the
threat actor behind REvil announced that it had infiltrated a major entertainment law firm’s
computer systems, and threatened to release information on U.S. President Donald Trump if
they did not receive a $42 million ransom. In this way, the REvil ransomware gang - now
reportedly considered a terrorist organization by the FBI - has become more than just a
hacking collective. REvil now dominates the threat ecosystem as the ultimate extortionist
cartel.

The recently reported attack against Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks was merely the latest
in a series of high-profile ransomware incidents perpetrated by the group. In early June, for
instance, REvil attempted to auction off data from Agromart Group, a Canadian agricultural
company; in mid-May, it was announced that REvil had attacked Sherwood Food
Distributors, a food distribution company based in Detroit. Notably, REvil (as well as some
other ransomware groups, such as Ragnarok) has proven particularly receptive to Citrix and
remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploits, a tool, technique, and procedure (TTP) we will delve
into later in this report. For REvil to have reached its level of notoriety and impact, however, it
required more than just technical talent. Fortunately for REvil and unfortunately for their
victims, the collective adopted a practice from their predecessor, GandCrab - reliance on
decentralized criminal networks.

In our previous reports, we observed how the GandCrab group revolutionized ransomware,
leveraging major criminal networks to conduct its activities. REvil has followed the same
path. Their representative(s), known across the DarkWeb by the alias “UNKN”, does not act
alone: they partner with other threat actors to bolster their own capabilities.

Force Multiplier “Sheriff”: An Expert In the Financial Sector & Citrix Breaches

REvil has been explicitly interested in recruiting top talent on the DarkWeb since Fall 2019.
Specifically, they were endorsed and supported by a hacker who uses the alias “Kerberos”;
we delve into “Kerberos” and their activities later in this report. “Kerberos” is a breach
specialist and REvil’s connection with the actor fits into a late-2019 trend, in which
ransomware groups and breach specialists collaborated in an effort to maximize profits.

Recently, REvil has deepened their cooperation with members of the criminal underground,
recruiting specialized experts as force-multipliers for their enterprise. One of their main
accomplices operates under the alias “Sheriff”; they are a rising star of the Russian-speaking
underground and specialize in attacks against banks, financial institutions, and government
agencies.

Sheriff’s main TTPs center on the use of brute-forcing (a method that relies on software to
guess many passwords, in the hopes of gaining access to an account) and credentialstealing malware. Historically, “Sheriff” has navigated compromised networks and admin
panels and then exfiltrated data using SQL injections (a web-based attack reliant on
nefarious code written in the SQL database querying language) and cross-site scripting
(XSS) (an attack that targets victims’ web browsers). In their interactions with REvil,
however, “Sheriff” has likely limited their activity to selling access to victims’ networks; REvil
likely uses this access to perform the actual data encryption and exfiltration.

In the past, Sheriff’s targets have included a major investment fund ($10 billion in assets)
and a private U.S. security company. Over the last couple of weeks, they have actively
exploited the Citrix remote desktop protocol (RDP), and advertised access to a number of
high-profile/high-revenue entities, including several universities in Australia, Canada, and the
United States; companies focused on security, long-distance passenger transportation,
warehouse materials, and cloud computing; and a “famous” European capital and cities in
Spain and France.

Earlier in June, “Sheriff” boasted Citrix RDP access to a European construction company
focused on oil projects, as well as access to 3,200 Cpanel accounts. Moreover, in May,
“Sheriff” advertised administrative access to an e-commerce entity’s WordPress plugin, as

well as access to approximately 815,000 orders, and information on “signatures, discounts,
bonuses,” and “gifts”. Most recently, on July 6, 2020, “Sheriff” offered access to 62,000 eToro
accounts.

As mentioned previously, “Sheriff” often pursues Citrix credentials to gain access to victims’
networks. RDP, when used for non-illicit means, can serve as a useful way for information
technology (IT) teams to access computer systems and diagnose problems. When used
nefariously, however, RDP can allow unauthorized users to claim administrative control over
a victim’s computer system or associated network. There have been numerous instances –
particularly in recent months – in which nefarious actors have taken advantage of Citrix
exploits.

In January 2020, for example, it was reported that the Ragnarok ransomware group had
taken advantage of one such exploit, leading to attacks on dozens of FireEye customers.
There have also been recorded instances of REvil using Citrix exploits in ransomware
attacks, such as one against “German car parts manufacturer Gedia Automotive Group”.
Considering “Sheriff” and REvil’s interaction in May 2020 (see below), “Sheriff’s” focus on
Citrix exploits, and REvil’s previous use of such exploits, we assess that REvil is likely to use
Citrix exploits again in future attacks.

auction participates to not attempt to compete with them on this bid

“Sherrif’s” interactions with REvil, however, likely go beyond the group’s “UNKN” alias. REvil
has also likely contacted “Sheriff” under the name, “unknown”. “UNKN’s” increasing notoriety
led to the deletion of REvil’s threats against President Trump on major DarkWeb forums.
REvil may be using the “unknown” alias as a new identity in the wake of their “unmasking”.

6/11

We have identified this new alias in communications with “Sheriff”. Assuming “unknown” is a
new alias for REvil, “Sheriff’s” interactions with “unknown” are notable, given both threat
actors’ notoriety and previous activity in the cybercriminal underground.

“Sheriff” is a high-profile threat actor focused on Citrix; their interactions with REvil amplify
the ransomware group’s threat to entities employing this kind of software, which is ubiquitous
and widely used. Users of Citrix with RDP must remain wary of the software’s vulnerabilities,
be prepared to patch them when available and monitor and review network perimeters for
any externally-exposed RDP servers.

Force Multiplier “energydrinkkk”: Expert In Attacks Against the Energy Sector

REvil has also proven closely aff0iliated with “Kerberos”, a high-profile threat actor who has
endorsed REvil directly. “Kerberos” is active on the top-tier Russian-language forum, posting
ads for coders and solicitations for access to various firms’ networks/financial information.
Notably, “Kerberos’” victim list includes a hospital, which follows a worrisome trend:
healthcare organizations have seen an uptick in attacks amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

Moreover, “Kerberos”, likely an affiliate of REvil, has interacted with “energydrinkkk”, an
underground threat actor who targets companies in the energy industry. “Energydrinkkk”
recently posted a solicitation offering RDP access to a United Arab Emirates/Canada-based
energy company’s Microsoft Online workspace. “Energydrinkkk’s” RDWeb exploit allegedly
provides access to a company engineer’s workspace on Microsoft Online, which houses
internal communications, as well as information on company contracts and purchases.
“Energydrinkkk” also claimed to be able to access company email, accessible through
employees’ personal computers. “Energydrinkkk” also alleges to have copied passwords and
approximately 400 pieces of contact information (including postal addresses, names, and
telephone numbers).

On May 8th, “Energydrinkkk” expressed a desire to enable a ransomware attack against the
company, and “Kerberos” – again, a likely affiliate of REvil – has subsequently responded in
kind; “Kerberos” posted on May 20th that they were interested in buying “Energydrinkkk’s”
access for $1,500.

Both “Kerberos” and “Sheriff” have expressed interest in RDP exploits. “Kerberos”, likely
acting on behalf of REvil, has attempted to purchase such exploits; “Sheriff”, meanwhile, has
sold such exploits to REvil. Given the fact that both “Sheriff” and “Kerberos” maintain interest
in RDP attacks – particularly those targeting energy-focused companies – and considering
that both threat actors have recently interacted with known/likely representatives of REvil
ransomware, AdvIntel assesses that REvil poses a threat to the energy sector, in particular.

The threat actors’ other solicitations have focused on the e-commerce, financial, and
healthcare industries, and as a result, AdvIntel believes that REvil poses a credible threat to
these industries, as well. It should be noted, however, that the threat REvil poses to victims
goes beyond data encryption; REvil has been known to exfiltrate data to a public-facing blog,
indicating that even prepared with data backups, companies can still risk reputational
damage in the event of an attack.

Conclusion

REvil’s recent activities in the cybercriminal underground significantly alter the ransomware
threat landscape.

10/11

Its interactions with high-profile threat actors suggest a preference to work as part of a
network intrusion-focused criminal syndicate, which is an entirely novel business model to a
Russian-speaking ransomware community historically reliant on mass spearphishing. The
group’s interactions with top-tier threat actors such as “Sheriff” and “Kerberos” indicate a
proclivity for RDP exploits, particularly in the energy sector, but also in finance, security, and
education. Given REvil’s targets’ prominence and large revenue streams, it appears that
REvil is now aiming for high-profile, high-reward attacks in critical industries.

Here are some possible steps entities can take to prevent attacks and mitigate
consequences from REvil related breaches:
1. entities whose data/networks have already been compromised must notify users of the
breach;
2. companies must ensure reliable backups of all system files and communications;
3. administrator rights should only be granted to users who absolutely require it;
4. antivirus software – as well as its source databases – must be updated to the latest
version, and used to verify programs before executing them;
5. access to unused system directories must be restricted; and
6. firewalls must be installed on user workstations to filter incoming connections.
REvil has gained substantial notoriety in the cybersecurity world, both for its connections to
GandCrab malware and for its own nefarious activities in the criminal underground. After
likely learning from GandCrab on how to organize extended criminal networks, REvil is now
enabled by other threat actors such as “Sheriff”, who sells its network access, and
“Kerberos”, who allows REvil the privilege of its endorsement (and possibly, its affiliation).

In this way, REvil and the actors it interacts with form a cohesive, underground economy, in
which victims – and the data they own – are the main commodity.

UPDATE: Image 1 of this report has been updated to correct a technical error. Image 1
illustrates that REvil does not only communicate with SHERIFF but is willing to pay a top
price in order to purchase underground auction bids offered by this threat actor.
