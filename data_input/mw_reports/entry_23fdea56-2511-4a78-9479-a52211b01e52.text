CyOps Lighthouse: Vidar Stealer

January 12, 2023

The Darknet is home to many underground hacking forums. In these forums, cybercriminals
talk freely: Sharing stories, tactics, success stories, and failures. Their conduct allows us to
peek into the politics and ethics of those groups and actors, as they talk about recent
activities.
CyOps Lighthouse aims to shed a light on those dark places. Apart from the underground
forums, we will also provide information regarding ongoing ransomware groups’ publications
and worthy mentions from the last month.

Vidar Stealer – the attacker’s perspective
Executive summary:
Vidar stealer is a malware that is offered for sale in the MAAS (Malware as a service) model.
It is present since 2018, and it is a variant of the “Arkei stealer”.
Vidar is currently one of the top stealers that are available for sale and is responsible for a
large sum of compromised credentials offered for sale on underground forums and
marketplaces.

Analysis:

1/9

Vidar stealer works as a MAAS, but unlike other stealers where buyers need to set their C2
and operate from it, all Vidar admin operations are done via a dedicated website, that can be
accessed either with a dedicated Onion address or a regular “Clearnet” website, when
entering the main URL we are greeted with the following:

An ode to Vidar, son of Odin and the god of vengeance.
Once we add the “Login” prompt to the URL, we can see Vidar’s operator login page:
Upon successful login, we will be greeted with the main Vidar panel:

The default login will show us the “Dashboard”, a summary of all the operations taken by the
operator, the number of infected machines, geolocation, Builder version (Updates
automatically), the current funds available at the crypto wallet, and all the stealers’ options
and possibilities on the left.
The “Logs” section is divided into several subcategories:

“All logs” is like the dashboard, it will show all logs in a given timeframe, with emphasis on
the log contents:

“Files” will show all files that were exfiltrated by the stealer:

“Passwords” is self-explanatory, and “Logs for download” will show all logs that are ready for
download.
As Vidar aims to be a “One stop shop”, it also provides the operators with a “Services” panel,
where they can filter and sign in directly to any SMTP/Banking/Cpanels/WordPress websites
that were found in the logs.
Moving over the “Workers” (Active bots) and “Statistics”, the settings panel is one of the most
important assets of an operator.
Under the main page, an operator can decide what assets to target on the infected host, as
well as set rules for “Grabber” – file exfiltration module, or “Loader” – set a rule for a followup activity on infected hosts.
Settings:

Grabber (Specify files type, max size, and folders to exfiltrate data):

Loader:

The “Builder” tab related to creating an executable from the panel, can be adjusted to set
multiple running campaigns with different targets in mind, it also includes all the “Builder
updates” – any constant updates that are pushed by the Vidar team:

The builder tab is also where operators activate their subscription, according to the required
timeframe:

Conclusion:
Vidar is among the top info stealers on the MAAS market.

8/9

It offers multiple “Follow up” activities as seen above, and all in the same Operator panel, this
makes their pricing a bit higher than other info stealers, but as the operation is going for a
long period, Vidar has already amassed a reputation of a reliable malware.
As we noticed in May 2022, Vidar is also one of the main sources for info stealer logs on
underground markets like “Russian Marketplace”:

Vidar, like other info stealers, is not “just” a stealer, it is responsible for most compromised
credentials offered on the darknet and can also be used as a loader for Ransomware to
follow up after a successful infection.
We strongly believe that unless an OPSEC mistake was to happen from the Vidar
team, they will remain a top threat to reckon with in 2023.
