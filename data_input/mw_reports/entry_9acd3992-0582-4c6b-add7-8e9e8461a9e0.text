2021 Year In Review
thedfirreport.com/2022/03/07/2021-year-in-review/
March 7, 2022

As we come to the end of the first quarter of 2022, we want to take some time to look back
over our cases from 2021, in aggregate, and look at some of the top tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTP’s) we observed. In total, we reported on 20 incidents in 2021, the vast
majority were initial access broker malware (Trickbot, IcedID, BazarLoader, etc.), which often
lead to full domain compromise and ransomware.
This report will contain details from all of our public reports over 2021, this is not
comprehensive of overall threat actor activity, as there is always inherit sampling and
collection bias. However, reviewing these common activities can help a defender prioritize
their time and budget, to protect against some of the most common threat actor behaviors.

Services
1/21

We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More
information on this service and others can be found here.
We also have artifacts available from our cases such as pcaps, memory captures, files,
event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and
Organization services.

Intrusion statistics aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework
Initial Access
Over the last year, we have witnessed numerous intrusions where malware variants such as
Trickbot, Hancitor, Bazar, and IcedID have been utilized as an entry point for ransomware
attacks. In the majority of the intrusions, the malware was distributed in the form of nontargeted phishing, such as mass malware spam campaigns.
Initial Access Sources 2021.

Our reports tend to focus on instances where phishing is the initial vector, as was the case in
16 of 20 reports. Although we still experience cases of threat actors compromising
vulnerable web-facing applications, those cases do not always turn into a large-scale
2/21

intrusion.. Our report on Exchange Exploit Leads to Domain Wide Ransomware, was the
only case where the threat actors actively sought to deploy ransomware after getting access
through a vulnerable application. The other two cases (All that for a Coinminer? and
WebLogic RCE Leads to XMRig) are a good representation of less impactful malicious
activity, where the threat actors installed cryptominers. However, we believe that these
intrusions can signal vulnerabilities that need immediate patching and remediation before
being exploited by a threat actor seeking larger scale objectives.
Phishing was the main initial access vector for our cases in 2021. The malware vectors we
saw in 2021 were:
1. TrickBot
2. Bazar
3. IcedID
4. Hancitor
The below graphic displays the tools/methods used by threat actors after getting initial
access via the initial access malware listed above.

Persistence
After execution of the initial access malware, many threat actors deploy persistence
mechanisms, such as the creation of scheduled tasks, deployment of web shells, remote
access software and registry “Run” Keys.
3/21

Scheduled Task Example (reference)

Add New User Example (reference)

Registry Run Key Example (reference)

In 14 of 20 cases, persistence was observed. Scheduled tasks were the most common
persistence method observed in our intrusions. In most, if not all cases, scheduled tasks,
bits-jobs, and registry run keys were executed from the initial malware vector. When we look
at the later stages of the attack, during post-exploitation activities, we can see that the threat
actors favor new user additions and third-party remote access software as the main
persistence techniques.

4/21

In some cases, we did not observe any typical form of persistence during the entire intrusion.
However, we found that these threat actors seem to prefer to broaden their access
throughout the network by launching several Cobalt Strike beacon sessions. In this way, they
can maintain their presence even if one or more compromised workstations become
inaccessible. Servers are often chosen during this beacon deployment phase, which is more
likely to remain online compared to a typical workstation.
Another common method observed to maintain access is by installing third-party remote
access software such as AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Splashtop and Atera. An interesting
observation is that the majority of this activity occurred on compromised domain controllers.
Here’s an example from the Conti Leaks that show the process of how they install AnyDesk:
"Anydesk"
cmd.exe /c C:ProgramDataAnyDesk.exe –install C:ProgramDataAnyDesk –start-withwin –silent
"And then we log in with a local admin or a domain account and use the charms of
Anydesk
You can also download / upload to / from the victim's machine…"#ContiLeaks

This AnyDesk activity was also observed in our Diavol Ransomware case.

5/21

Privilege Escalation/Credential Access
With respect to credential access, multiple techniques were utilized by the threat actors.
Some of the notable ones are: Dumping of LSASS using Task Manager and Procdump,
creation of a copy of NTDS.dit using ntdsutil.exe and extraction of SAM, SECURITY and
SYSTEM hives.
Depending on the level of access, threat actors are looking to escalate privileges on the
beachhead host to leverage high integrity Beacon sessions. Having high integrity access
allows them to access credentials from the host using various methods. Below, we highlight
the privilege escalation and credential access methods observed across our 2021 reports.

6/21

Accessing the LSASS process is the method that we see used by threat actors in the
majority of the cases. Using Cobalt Strike, attackers can extract credentials from the LSASS
process either with the use of Mimikatz or by accessing the security hives. We covered
related detections in our Cobalt Strike, a Defender’s Guide.
Threat actors can also use third-party tools such as ProcDump or even Task Manager in
cases where remote interactive access is possible. These methods allow them to dump the
LSASS process to disk and take it offline to extract the credentials.
ProcDump Example (reference)

Task Manager Example (reference)

7/21

Defense Evasion
When it comes to defense evasion, we noticed that process injection techniques were very
common among threat actors. This allows them to establish additional Beacons on the
already compromised hosts, to avoid detection.
In five separate cases, we encountered threat actors disabling security tools using various
methods. One of the most notable cases was the IcedID to XingLocker Ransomware in 24
hours case. In that case, the attackers used multiple batch files to disable well-known AV and
EDR agents on the host. The batch scripts came from the first revision of Revisions · quickdisable-windows-defender.bat · GitHub, which was used by the ransomware operators
without making any changes.

8/21

Masquerading Example (reference)

Obfuscation Example (reference)

Discovery
Once access is established, threat actors then need to enumerate the victim environment.
Common initial discovery tools include Windows built-in utilities (net.exe, nltest.exe,
systeminfo, ipconfig, whoami, etc) and the AdFind tool. In a few cases, adversaries
attempted to get a listing of open ports/running services on remote hosts by performing port
scans using tools such as Advanced IP Scanner and KPortScan 3.0.
The first thing we observe from hands-on keyboard operators is usually additional discovery
activity. We see threat actors concentrate on searching for the Domain Controllers and
general environmental information.
The statistics below illustrate the most used Windows tools for enumerating the environment.
We compare each tool to the total percent of cases investigated.

9/21

We see the enumeration commands executed in a short time span, between 1-5 seconds.
The execution is usually done through post-exploitation frameworks (Cobalt Strike in most
cases).

Example screenshot is taken from the case: From Zero to Domain Admin
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C net time
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C ping [Domain Controller]
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:[Domain Name]
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C Net group "Domain Admins" /domain \
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C nslookup
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C ping 190.114.254.116
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C net group /domain

Lateral Movement
Lateral movement is a vital component of threat actor TTPs. Once they get the lay of the
land through the discovery methods we outlined above, we repeatedly see them move
laterally across the network. Domain Controllers, file shares and similarly high-value servers
are primary targets.
10/21

The number one post-exploitation framework of choice, Cobalt Strike, allows threat actors to
leverage different techniques for the purpose of lateral movement.
Other common choices for threat attackers include Remote Desktop connections, remote
WMI execution of transferred binaries, and the Sysinternals tool PsExec.

Command and Control
One common theme seen across the majority of the intrusions has been the reliance on
Cobalt Strike for performing post-exploitation activities. In almost all cases, the initial access
brokers such as Trickbot and Bazar, dropped multiple Cobalt Strike beacons across the
victim environment.
For an in-depth breakdown of some of the network operations of Cobalt Strike see our recent
report on the topic.

Exfiltration
While exfiltration of data was not a common sight in our data set, we observed exfil in 6 of
the 20 cases. In the cases where data exfiltration was observed, the threat actors used tools
such as RClone, FileZilla, or WinSCP to transfer the data to their controlled servers. In many
other cases, threat actors downloaded sensitive data via Cobalt Strike Beacons.
One notable case for the year was the Diavol Ransomware. Ransomware operators used
ufile.io to upload the LSASS dump file they extracted from one of the domain controllers.

12/21

To wrap up this chapter, we’d like to provide an overview of the tools that we’ve seen
attackers employ this year. We included the tools in their respective phases of attack after
seeing them in action. We used the MITRE ATT&CK framework to show how these tools
work at various phases of an attack.

Indicators of Attack/Behavior-based information focusing on the
human element

13/21

In our cases, we frequently observe hands-on keyboard activity by the threat actor during the
intrusion. This provides a unique insight into the human side of the attack – how they
conduct operations, respond to challenges, and how they use the tooling to achieve effects.
This provides additional detection opportunities – in addition to Indicators of Compromise
(IoC) and Indicators of Activity (IoA).
It is impressive to see that, in some instances, threat actors have adapted their tools,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to evade detection. In other cases, we’ve observed
operator mistakes, errors of judgement, and operational security (OPSEC) failures. We have
also witnessed some of the challenges they encounter during intrusions.
Looking into the early Cyber Kill Chain steps of the intrusions, we see that some tasks are
automated. However, once an attacker is within a target’s operating environment, many
activities often require hands-on keyboard intervention by the operator in order to continue
with their objectives. During this period, all the attacker’s hands-on keyboard activities can
bring risk of detection or bring them one step closer to their objectives. Some of the typical
hands-on keyboard activities include:
Discovering security audit tools
Overcoming security tools by disabling them all together
Encountering lateral movement barriers and seeking alternative approaches, etc.
We looked into our most popular and unusual activities related to attackers’ activities, which
we will discuss below, from attackers’ tooling configurations, to usage, and conduct during
intrusions.

Cobalt Strike
A common trend observed in our cases is the use of Cobalt Strike which is usually
configured with a standard malleable C2 profile. A malleable C2 profile specifies a number of
parameters, such as user agent string, spawn to process, jitter etc. Most of the default
profiles are well known and can be detected by host and network monitoring rules.
Cobalt Strike continues to be the top post-exploitation tool favored by most threat actor
groups, with the most popular malleable c2 profile observed this year being ‘jquery3.3.1.min.js’ with the relevant Beacon spawning under Rundll32.exe. The chart below
illustrates the most popular spawn-as executable types and some rare ones, such as
calc.exe that we saw in 2021.

14/21

detection, check out our second Cobalt Strike report – Cobalt Strike, a Defender’s Guide –
Part 2.

Thou shall follow the playbook
Following the playbook in the literal sense, copying and pasting commands are more
common than expected. We have observed cases where operators kept entering misspelled
commands taken from documentation. In one case, we observed the operator copying and
pasting commands from a script, neglecting to provide the actual IPv4 addresses as the
required parameter:

In the case BazarLoader and the Conti Leaks, the operator accidentally entered a Cobalt
Strike command via the Windows command line:

We can only assume that the operators attempted to invoke a Cobalt Strike aggressor script
to enumerate and discover the installed AV. Later on, in 2021, the Conti playbooks were
leaked, allowing us to link this activity with the operator’s hands-on keyboard-related task.
We were then able to reference many of the observed activities in our previous cases and
provide insights through our Twitter account:

BYOT (Bring Your Own Tools)
We are astonished by the number of tools brought into an intrusion. Along with third-party
tooling, living-off-the-land techniques are routinely observed – especially during the
discovery phase. Bringing tools into an environment introduces several risks for the operator
and opportunities for the defender from a detection point of view. Some of those risks include
detection and blocking by AV, software incompatibilities, software restriction policies, etc. As
discussed in the sections above, the most popular tool observed this year is AdFind. AdFind
is the usual suspect in almost every intrusion we report. In 2020, we published a whole
article covering this tool.
Other tools and scripts we have encountered during the past year across a number of
published cases are illustrated below:

16/21

Occasionally, we observe threat actors making changes to their tool configurations inside the
infected host. Below is an example where threat actors made the necessary changes before
a successful ransomware execution.

Case: CONTInuing the Bazar Ransomware Story

Every Contact Leaves a Trace
Every case provides us with a range of artifacts that are left behind on hosts, either
intentionally (threat actor bringing own tools) or as a byproduct (execution of commands via
prefetch). Artifacts can include scripts, tools, beacons, staged files, etc.
A common trend observed, is that there is very little effort to remove traces during and after
the intrusion. Some examples from our cases include:
Running beacons that have failed to call home, resulting in persistent DNS callback requests
from processes that wouldn’t be expected to make high volume of requests. Look for domain
traffic, where the polling requests have a consistent trend profile. In this example, a beacon
is sending heartbeats to an unreachable C2 server, notice that the requests per-hour and
per-day are consistent.

Results of various Tools/scripts are left behind along with the tools themselves, i.e. text files
containing collected host details from discovery, executable beacons in user folders etc.
BloodHound files dropped to disk

AdFind results written to disk

Task Manager dumping Lsass

Attacker Infrastructure
We have observed several instances where the threat actor’s infrastructure becomes
exposed during the intrusion. One example includes the operator’s source machine during a
remote desktop session – CONTInuing the Bazar Ransomware.

Another case, was during what we believed to have been a technical issue – a hosted
beacon, was remotely pulled (out of band coms) – rather than through the standard C2 that
was already established – BazarCall to Conti Ransomware via Trickbot and Cobalt Strike.

18/21

The payload was available from a public facing IP, and pulled using the curl command
(evident by the Curl user agent string).\

Not all intrusions are successful; sometimes, attackers come across technical issues. Some
issues include tooling that doesn’t function as expected and other environmental-specific
challenges that would slow down expansion within the network.

Fingerprinting
Fingerprinting threat actors’ craftsmanship is one of the more fascinating conclusions made
when investigating artifacts. In the case of CONTInuing the Bazar Ransomware Story the
use of profanity was embedded within the HTA file.

These can be useful IoCs in and of themselves. In other circumstances, threat actors spend
considerable effort developing bespoke software, only to leave identifiers such as helpful
group names and version numbers.

Final Advice for Defenders
From a defender’s perspective, each of the above points provides various detection
opportunities. These could include recognizing outlier behavior, such as binaries executing
from non-standard locations, or detecting outlier activity, such as a high frequency of crashes
within a short period of each other.
Reducing your attack surface and regular patching can have some big wins and avoid some
common scenarios we have seen in 2021, such as initial compromises through Log4j and
ProxyShell/ProxyLogon exploits. Disabling macros and forcing scriptable files to open in
notepad will also provide a high level of return on investment.
We would like to highlight a few guides that CISA has released that can assist defenders and
organizations in getting their attack surface under control.
19/21

Stuff off Search
By using various online search platforms it is possible to get an understanding of what
services, assets and devices are exposed on the internet. Reducing this footprint limits the
adversaries’ potential entries into the organization’s network.
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities & Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2021
Using these resources along with “S.O.S” defenders and organizations can identify the
vulnerabilities associated with their exposed assets. By prioritizing assets that have known
vulnerabilities which are actively exploited, the organization can remediate risk quicker and
focus on things that provide a high return on investment.
CISA, ASD/ACSC, Mandiant, Microsoft and the UK NCSC have plenty of information and
guides regarding protecting against ransomware and general best practices for logging,
network architecture and tips for everyday users.
Many of the ransomware TTPs are not complex or stealthy. One of the primary reasons
behind this is that they do not need to be stealthy to achieve their goals. We commonly see
threat actors use Cobalt Strike more than other implants due to the ease of use and the fact
that it is a really powerful post-exploitation framework.
We have released a two-part guide about Cobalt Strike to assist defenders in understanding
more, and hopefully; are better equipped to detect this framework. The guide can be found
here:

https://thedfirreport.com/2022/01/24/cobalt-strike-a-defenders-guide-part-2/

Outlook
There is no magic bullet to make ransomware disappear, and we anticipate that
ransomware-based attacks will continue while incentives remain. Across the globe, multiple
countries like USA, Australia and Netherlands have announced task forces to focus on the
ransomware threat.
Australia specifically announced their “Ransomware Action Plan” and planned to achieve
part of it using offensive cyber capabilities [1]. The Netherlands has also announced similar
efforts [2]. Ransomware actors may become risk-averse and select their targets more
carefully to avoid being attacked by such operations. We hope to see more ransomware
groups brought down in the following year, as well, as a consequence of such operations.
