Who is Mr Guo?

In our last post, we stated that a source whose identity we had verified had named an MSS
Officer in Jinan who was believed to be involved in Cyber operations. We are now in a
position to reveal that the name provided to us is 郭林 (Guo Lin). Open source research
conducted by analysts working for Intrusion Truth quickly revealed a potential candidate for
Guo Lin.
Guo Lin, Masters Student
An IT security paper from 2007 called ‘基于多维角度的攻击分类方法‘ (Method of Classifying
Attacks Based on Multi-dimension) was authored by a Guo Lin in which he described himself
as a Masters student conducting research into network and information security and
malicious code detection. Guo was a Computer Science student at Nanjing University (not
Jinan), making it uncertain whether he is indeed the same individual in Jinan named in our
tip.
There is nothing wrong with being a Masters student, of course. So let’s take a look at what
else Guo has been up to.

Our high confidence that we have the right person comes from the e-mail address used by
Guo in the paper – glince[at]163.com. We will show how the e-mail address links Guo to
Jinan.

Historical WHOIS data shows that the e-mail address glince[at]163.com was the original
registrant of a number of domain names and was the admin contact for antorsoft[.]com.

Antorsoft historical WHOIS
Jinan Quanxin Fangyuan Technology Co. Ltd.
Domain registration information for antorsoft[.]com names the registrant as Jinan Quanxin
Fangyuan Technology Co. Ltd, which translates into Chinese as 济南全欣方沅科技有限公司.
The address is listed as 238, Jing Shi Dong Lu, Jinan, 250000, Shandong, China.
Importantly, this company is based in Jinan, just where our tip said Guo Lin was based.
Another Chinese website lists a different address for the same company at No. 12, Qilihe
Road, Licheng District, Jinan, Shandong:

Second address for Jinan Quanxin Fangyuan
Jinan Anchuang Information Technology Co. Ltd.
However, the website for Antorsoft, which was still active at the time of writing, names the
company as 济南安创信息科技有限公司, which in English is rendered Jinan Anchuang
Information Technology Co. Ltd. It claims to be a ‘state-level high-tech enterprise that
integrates development, productions, management and technical services with scientific
research as the guide’. It claims to ‘strive to become an excellent supplier of global
information security services and communications products’.

On a second page Antorsoft claims to look at Cyber Security issues from the perspective of
those committing Cyber attacks. What an interesting perspective to have chosen…

Antorsoft description of services offered
A healthcare company? With MSS links?
So far, so good. We’ve got a likely MSS Officer running and Information Technology
company, or two, on the side. Why, then, in this brochure (left) – which we were passed by a
friend – does Jinan Anchuang claim to be a healthcare company focusing on child health
development? It is definitely the same company – you’ll see that the brochure is signed by 郭
林 (Guo Lin) using both his name and his ‘Glince’ nickname.
All becomes clear in a second version of the same document (right). No headed paper, no
signature, but the same company name and founding date.

But. The description is different. Now it’s an IT company. And at the bottom is a list of clients,
including 四川省国家安全厅, the Sichuan State Security Department. For those not experts in
Chinese national security departments, the SSSD is the provincial department of the Ministry
of State Security in Sichuan.
Oops.
Sichuan isn’t Shandong, where Jinan is located, but perhaps we will find more links later.
Use of alias names?
This is one of our favourite discoveries. Using (previously hacked and released) data from
Chinese messaging service QQ, we were able to find Guo Lin’s QQ account, which is
21213804. At the time that the data was released, 21213804 was a member of a number of
QQ groups. In many of these, the name he used was 郭林, which is transliterated ‘Guo Lin’.
So far so good.
But the QQ data shows that he was also a member of an ‘Antorsoft’ group (QQ number
7043291) created in 2004. In that group he used the name 林子 (Lin Zi), Lin being his first (or
‘given’) name and Zi, in this instance, being used to extend a single syllable name into a
nicer sounding two syllable word (Zi roughly translates to ‘thing’). For the purposes of our
analysis we will translate ‘Zi’ as ‘Mr’ – think Reservoir Dogs and you’ll see why.

Looking at the other members of the Antorsoft group in the QQ data, a pattern begins to
emerge. Each of them was a single name – some connected to their real name, some
apparently random – with ‘Zi’ appended. In many cases, it seems to form a sort of nickname
or ‘codeword’ – 林子, for example, means ‘Mr Forest’. Here is the complete list:
QQ 21213804 uses ‘Mr Forest’ 林子 (Linzi) in the Antorsoft group but normally uses the
name 郭林 (Guo Lin)
QQ 10832991 uses ‘Mr Ocean’ 海子 (Haizi) in the Antorsoft group but normally uses
the names 龙海 (Long Hai) ‘Dragon Ocean’ and Fei Long (飞龙) ‘Flying Dragon’
QQ 23793808 uses ‘Mr Bamboo’ 竹子 (Zhuzi) in the Antorsoft group but also the name
‘Zhuyuzi’
QQ 87414156 uses ‘Mr Monkey’ 猴子 (Houzi) in the Antorsoft group
QQ 369782831 uses ‘Mr Pine’ 松子 (Songzi) in the Antorsoft group
QQ 1137938323 uses 亮子 (Liangzi) in the Antorsoft group
QQ 26250040 uses ‘Mr Chen’ 陈子 (Chenzi) in the Antorsoft group but also the name
雨巷 (Yuxiang) or ‘Rain Alley’
Interestingly, Yuxiang was also in a QQ group called 江苏公务员考试交流 (Jiangsu Civil
Service Examination Exchange), created in 2009. The group description is the 南京大学公务
员考试群 (Nanjing University Civil Service Examination Group), giving us another link to
Nanjing.
In summary, we discovered two IT Security Companies based in Jinan, affiliated with a
Chinese individual who studied Information Security to Masters level. Our source
claims that individual is an active MSS Officer involved in Cyber operations. One of
the companies appears to have some sort of healthcare company front, whilst
simultaneously claiming to be an SSSD InfoSec contractor. And employees use alias
names on QQ when dealing with Antorsoft.
What we still don’t know is: who else works in these companies and do they have any
connections to APT attacks?
