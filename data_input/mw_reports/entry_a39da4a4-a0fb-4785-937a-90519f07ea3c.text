February 25, 2022 Update
On February 24 2022, Symantec Enterprise reported a ransomware dubbed as PartyTicket
was deployed alongside the HermeticWiper malware. IBM Security X-Force obtained a
sample of the PartyTicket ransomware and has provided technical analysis, indicators of
compromise, and detections within the PartyTicket section of this blog.
On February 23, 2022, open-source intelligence sources began reporting detections of a
wiper malware — a destructive family of malware designed to permanently destroy data from
the target — executing on systems belonging to Ukrainian organizations. IBM Security XForce obtained a sample of the wiper named HermeticWiper. It uses a benign partition
manager driver (a copy of empntdrv.sys) to perform its wiping capabilities corrupting all
available physical drives’ Master Boot Record (MBR), partition, and file system (FAT or
NTFS).
This is not the first wiper malware targeting Ukrainian organizations X-Force has analyzed. In
January 2022, X-Force analyzed the WhisperGate malware and did not identify any code
overlaps between WhisperGate and HermeticWiper.
This blog post will detail IBM Security X-Force’s insights into the HermeticWiper malware,
technical analysis of the sample, and indicators of compromise (IoC) to help organizations
protect themselves from this malware.

Why This Is Important
In January 2022, X-Force analyzed the WhisperGate malware. HermeticWIper is the second
newly seen destructive malware family observed in the past two months targeting
organizations in Ukraine, and reportedly other countries in Eastern Europe. No code
overlaps were identified between WhisperGate and HermeticWiper.
The pace at which these new, destructive malware families are being deployed and
discovered is unprecedented, and further highlights the need for organizations to have an
active and informed defense strategy that expands beyond signature-based defenses.
As the conflict in the region continues to evolve and given the destructive capabilities of both
WhisperGate and HermeticWiper, IBM Security X-Force recommends critical infrastructure
organizations within the targeted region fortify defenses. Those organizations should focus
on preparation for potential attacks that can destroy or encrypt data or otherwise significantly
impact operations.
It is of X-Force’s opinion that destructive cyber attacks will likely continue to be leveraged
against civilian targets in support of hybrid operations. In addition, X-Force believes it is likely
cyber attacks will continue to escalate and expand in parallel with the scope of the ongoing

conflict. It should be noted the increasing number of destructive capabilities focused against
private industry and entities associated with the Ukraine and its perceived allies, will likely
alter the cyber security environment by creating an elevated threat to regional commerce.

Analysis Details
This section contains the results of the analysis performed for the submitted samples. Typical
analysis includes both behavioral and static analysis.
Behavioral analysis describes the malware behavior observed on a system during execution.
Behavioral analysis typically includes actions performed on the system such as files
dropped, persistence, details surrounding process execution and any C2 communications. It
should be noted that behavioral analysis may not capture all notable malware behavior as
certain functions may only be performed by the malware under specific conditions.
Static analysis is a deeper dive into the technical analysis of the malware. Static analysis
typically includes further details about the functionality, obfuscation or packing in the sample,
encryption used by the malware, configuration information or other notable technical detail.

Behavioral Analysis
Upon execution, HermeticWiper immediately adjusts its process token privileges and
enables SeBackupPrivilege. This gives the malware read access control to any file,
regardless of whatever is specified in access control list (ACL).

It then checks for the system’s OS version to know which version copy of a benign partition
management driver (EaseUS Partition Manager: epmntdrv.sys) it will use. The driver is
initially Microsoft compressed (SZDD compression) and embedded in its resource named
RCDATA.

For Windows XP:
x86 – it uses DRV_XP_X86
x64 – it uses DRV_XPX64
For Windows 7 and up:
x86 – it uses DRV_X86
x64 – it uses DRV_X64

4/13

After verifying what version it will use, the SZDD compressed benign partition management
driver is then dropped in the following directory as:
%WINDIR%\system32\driver\<random_2chars>dr
Example: C:\Windows\system32\Drivers\vfdr

It then proceeds to decompress it and adds “.sys” as file extension.
Example: C:\Windows\system32\Drivers\vfdr.sys

It then proceeds to adjust its process token privileges again to enable SeLoadDriverPrivilege.
This token enables the process of HermeticWiper have the ability to load and unload device
drivers.

Next, it disables crash dumps by modifying the following registry key:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl
CrashDumpEnabled = 0

Note that crash dumps are memory dumps that contains information why the system stops
unexpectedly. With this option disabled, the system will be prevented to create any dumps,
thus successfully covering its tracks.
5/13

It also disables Volume Shadow Service (vss) if enabled, and disables ShowCompColor and
ShowInfoTip in all HKEY_USERS registry:
HKEY_USERS\<ID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
ShowCompColor = 0
ShowInfoTip = 0

ShowCompColor option displays compressed and encrypted NTFS files in color while
ShowInfoTip shows pop-up descriptions for folder and desktop items.
HermeticWiper then proceeds to add and load the created driver as a service using Windows
APIs such as OpenSCManagerW(), OpenServiceW(), CreateServiceW() and
StartServiceW().
Example:

This creates a service entry in the registry:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\<random_2chars>dr

Once the benign driver service is started and loaded in the system, it then proceeds to cover
its tracks once again by deleting the created driver in %WINDIR%\system32\drivers and
deleting the created service in the registry.
HermeticWiper enumerates a range of up to 100 Physical Drives by looping 0-100. It uses
the benign partition manager, now loaded in the system, to corrupt all Master Boot Record
(MBR) for every Physical Drive present in the system.
But it doesn’t stop there, it also corrupts all the available partition even supporting both FAT
and NTFS file system. For NTFS, it also corrupts the Master File Table (MFT) which holds all
information about a file to ensure that data will be unrecoverable.
Once all disks are corrupted, the system should result to a crash, but just in case,
HermeticWiper also created a fail-safe sleeping thread that triggers a system shutdown to
force restart the target system.

Static Analysis

6/13

Analysis of the wiper sample revealed it was signed with a digital certificate issued to an
organization named ‘Hermetica Digital Ltd’ and was created April 15, 2021. A digital
certificate is a file or cryptographic signature that proves the authenticity of an item such as a
file, server, or user.
HermeticWiper contains the following digital certificate:

IBM Security X-Force has developed the following Yara signature to detect additional
instances of the HermeticWiper.

}

PartyTicket Analysis
The ransomware sample dubbed as PartyTicket is a Golang compiled ransomware which is
believed to be distributed alongside the HermeticWiper malware that targets Ukraine
organizations.
PartyTicket ransomware doesn’t include any escalation of privileges and will execute within
the context of the current user. This means that if it was executed with a non-privileged
account, folders and files requiring higher privileges will not be encrypted.
PartyTicket adds “.[[email protected]].encryptedJB” as file extension to all files it encrypts.
It uses both RSA and AES to encrypt targeted files.
Initial static analysis of the ransomware reveals “Biden” and “Whitehouse” referenced within
the code.

Upon execution, PartyTicket ransomware builds a list of files to encrypt by checking for all
available drives from A: to Z: and traversing all directories except for those containing
“Windows” and “Program Files”.
While traversing the directory structure, the ransomware enumerates a target list of files
containing the following extensions:

9/13

.acl, .avi, .bat, .bmp, .cab, .cfg, .chm, .cmd, .com, .crt, .css, .dat,
.dip, .dll, .doc, .dot, .exe, .gif, .htm, .ico, .iso, .jpg, .mp3, .msi,
.odt, .one, .ova, .pdf, .png, .ppt, .pub, .rar, .rtf, .sfx, .sql, .txt,
.url, .vdi, .vsd, .wma, .wmv, .wtv, .xls, .xml, .xps, .zip, .docx, .epub,
.html, .jpeg, .pptx, .xlsx, .pgsql, .contact, inc

Note that .exe is included in the target file to encrypt, indicating that the ransomware will
encrypt itself afterwards.
Once the target list is created, the ransomware will create a copy of itself with a universally
unique identifier (UUID) name for every file within the target list. The copies are executed
with a thirty-second timeout as children of the original PartyTicket process, each responsible
for encrypting a file within the target file list.
Example PartyTicket child process execution lifecycle:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe cmd /c copy <PartyTicket.exe> b6771851-a96811eb-9f9f-000c29fc4fde.exe
b6771851-a968-11eb-9f9f-000c29fc4fde.exe.exe <target_file_to_encrypt>
timeout /t 30 && C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C del <UUID>.exe

Response
At this time, X-Force recommends organizations implement detections for the file system,
registry, and Windows service indicators listed in this report as well as leveraging the
provided Yara rule to scan files. Additionally, global businesses should seek to establish
sound insight into their respective networks, supply chains, third parties, and partnerships
that are based in, or serve in-region institutions. It is also advised that organizations open
lines of communications between relevant information-sharing entities to ensure the receipt
and exchange of actionable indicators.
In addition to response measures associated with the indicators of compromise, X-Force
recommends organizations consider the following proactive measures:
Block high-risk protocols on all B2B VPNs
Implement netflow monitoring at all egress points
Have contingency plans in place to disconnect B2B VPNs, particularly those that are
high-risk
Prevent loading of unknown driver files
