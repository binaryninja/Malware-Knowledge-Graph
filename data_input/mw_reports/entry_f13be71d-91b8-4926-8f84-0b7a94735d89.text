July 27, 2020

Ensiko is a PHP web shell with ransomware capabilities that targets various platforms such as Linux, Windows,
macOS, or any other platform that has PHP installed. The malware has the capability to remotely control the
system and accept commands to perform malicious activities on the infected machine.
It can also execute shell commands on an infected system and send the results back to the attacker via a PHP
reverse shell. It is capable of scanning servers for the presence of other webshells, defacing websites, sending
mass emails, downloading remote files, disclosing information about the affected server, brute-force attacks
against file transfer protocol (FTP), cPanel, and Telnet, overwriting files with specified extensions, and more.

Technical Details
Webshell Authentication
The malware has the ability to be password-protected. For authentication, the malware displays a Not Found
page with a hidden login form as seen in the next two figures:
Not Found page and hidden login form Figure 1. Not Found page and hidden login form

The password for this sample is “RaBiitch”, while the following figure shows captured network traffic for an
authentication request to the web shell panel:

Ransomware Analysis
The malware uses PHP RIJNDAEL_128 with CBC mode to encrypt files in a web shell directory and
subdirectories and appends filenames with the “.bak” extension. The following code snippet demonstrates this
behavior of the malware:

POST request to affected server Figure 11. POST request to affected server
The malware also drops an index.php file and sets it as the default page using a .htaccess file; the attacker is
also notified of this action via email. The following code snippet shows this behavior:

Tool Set
To carry out more tasks on an infected system, the malware can load various additional tools onto an infected
system. Most of these tools are loaded from Pastebin. The malware creates a directory called tools_ensikology
to store these tools.

Steganologer
There is a technique in which a malicious actor hides code within the exchangeable image file format (EXIF)
headers of an image file and uses a PHP function called exif_read_data to extract and run this code on an
affected server. The steganologer function identifies images with EXIF headers and labels them as a logger. In
the following screenshot, test1.jpg and test2.jpg both have EXIF headers with hidden code and are identified s.

Backdoor Scan
A backdoor scan checks a given remote host for the existence of a webshell from a hardcoded list.

Remote server scan
Like a backdoor scan, the remote server scan function-checks the remote server for the presence of other web
shells. However, instead of using a hardcoded list, it accepts manual input for files to be searched for:

Conclusion
Ensiko is a web shell used by an attacker that enables remote administration, file encryption, and many more
features on a compromised web server. A common method to deploy web shell is exploiting web application
vulnerabilities or *gaining access to an already compromised server. Additionally, Ensiko has ransomware
capability to encrypt files on an infected web server using the RIJNDAEL encryption algorithm. It is also
capable of scanning servers for the presence of other web shells, defacing websites, sending mass emails,
downloading remote files, disclosing information about the affected server, gaining access to databases,
running brute-force attacks against file transfer protocol (FTP), cPanel, and Telnet, overwriting files with
specified extensions, and more.
