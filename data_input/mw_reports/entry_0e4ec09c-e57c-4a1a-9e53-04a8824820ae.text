Network infrastructure analysis plays an important role in the study of malware distribution campaigns. Data on
which IP addresses corresponded to a given domain name over time facilitate the identification of new malicious
servers. In turn, retrospectively determining which domains were resolved to a given IP address provides new
domains, for which the search procedure can be repeated, leading the process further. This information can be
immensely helpful in establishing the geography of nodes, identifying "favorite" hosts and registrars, and
determining which values an attacker characteristically enters into fields when registering domains.
Metainformation that appears useless at first glance may very well prove its worth after a period of a days, weeks,
or months. In the course of malware analysis, sooner or later the question of attribution inevitably arises, and
indirect identifiers such as network indicators can go a long way in determining which criminal group a certain tool
belongs to.
This article examines the most characteristic network infrastructure indicators of the TA505 group, as well as
intersections between TA505 and another hacker group, Buhtrap.

Domain name registrars
In total, we analyzed 372 domains belonging to TA505 and identified 22 organizations that facilitated the acquisition
of these domains. The resources most frequently used were the following:
WhoisGuard, Inc. — 28 domain names
Eranet International Limited — 26 domain names
WhoisGuard, an organization based in Panama, offers the service of concealing domain owners' registration data
from public access. This is not the first time we have seen their services used by hackers to establish anonymity
and hinder investigations.

TA505 has utilized other, similar services, though to a lesser extent. These include PROTECTSERVICE LTD, Whois
Privacy Protection Foundation, and Domains by Proxy LLC.
Eranet International Limited is one of the largest registrars in Hong Kong. It should be noted that members of TA505
tended to use dynamic DNS when registering domains with this provider. As a result, the IP addresses that their
domain names were resolved to changed frequently, making them difficult to track.

Naturally, not all this information can be taken at face value. There are, however, certain values particularly worth
noting. For instance, a search on the email address ctouma2@gmail.com leads to a list of additional domains
registered to the same address. Another email address, 0141.koppe.pan@gmail.com, is linked with a variety of
resources—an account on Github, Steam, the Japanese hacker forum Qiita (with a link to a malicious domain in the
profile), a YouTube channel, an account in Skype (live: 141.koppe.pan), and so forth.

We will refrain from delving into a deep analysis of these WHOIS data, as it lies outside the scope of this article. We
will, however, note that hackers often utilize legitimate resources that have been compromised to host the first stage
of their malware campaigns. The following domains are cases in point:

nanepashemet[.]com
nagomi-753[.]jp

Autonomous systems (AS)
For the sake of completeness, here are the top autonomous systems to which the IP addresses of C&C servers
used by TA505 belong. Of course, a single autonomous system serves many hosts, both legitimate and nonlegitimate, including various malware families of disparate origins. The following statistics should simply be viewed
as an overview of the attacker's preferences. Taken with other data, they can be used for attribution.

TA505 and Buhtrap
On July 11, 2019, specialists from ESET released an article about a recent attack carried out by the Buhtrap group
using a zero-day vulnerability in the Win32k component of Windows. The article described a so-called 'grabber'
module used to harvest user passwords from email clients, browsers, and other sources. Later, we unearthed
another similar module (MD5: c6e9d7280f77977a6968722e8124f51c) with the same C&C server in its body
(redmond.corp-microsoft[.]com).

C&C server in the

Buhtrap grabber module
Running a query through the PaSiveTotal resource reveals that this host has been rendered to the IP address
95[.]179.159.170 since June 6, 2019.
Several days earlier, on July 2, 2019, specialists from Proofpoint released a report regarding new tools used by the
TA505 group, one of which is called Andromut (also known as Gelup). Andromut is a downloader for the
FlawedAmmyy RAT. One of the variations of the downloader that we encountered (MD5:
0cbeb424d96e5c268ec2525d603f64eb) uses the domain compatexchange-cloudapp[.]net as its C&C server.

C&C server in Gelup from TA505,

after decryption
The PaSiveTotal resource shows us that this host has been resolved to the IP address 95[.]179.159.170 since June
8, 2019.
These two domains were registered with the same registrar (Tucows Domains Inc.) within two days of one another,
and are resolved to the same IP address. Considering that both groups carried out attacks throughout June, it is
reasonable to conclude that Buhtrap and TA505 used the same host as a C&C server.
It is also worth noting that the domain compatexchange-cloudapp[.]net was used not only in the downloader earlier
discussed, but also in older versions of Buhtrap components.

First intersection of TA505 and Buhtrap found in

network infrastructure
We later discovered another intersection between the two hacker groups. The domains of TA505's Smoke Loader
and a second grabber from Buhtrap displayed a similar congruence: the domain test-service012505[.]com from
Smoke Loader (MD5: 5fc6f24d43bc7ca45a81d159291955d1) and the domain secure-telemetry[.] net from the
gabber (MD5: 79d1a836423c7ee57b6127cf2930a9d9) have been resolved to the IP address 194[.]4.56.252 since
June 17th and 16th, 2019, respectively.

Conclusions
This article has examined the network infrastructure of the hacker group TA505. Starting with a look at their
preferred domain name registrars and the hosts of their C&C servers, we unearthed interesting details in the client
information provided by the group during domain registration. This could serve as a starting point for further
investigations. We then discussed intersections that were discovered between the infrastructure of the TA505 and
Buhtrap hacker groups. The incidence of shared servers between the two groups could have several explanations:
the groups could have a bilateral agreement to share the servers, they could be managed and coordinated by a
single entity, or they could both rent the servers from a third party (thereby economizing on expenditures). Our work
investigating these groups will not end here. We will continue to monitor their activity and search for new information
on their possible connections and collaboration.
