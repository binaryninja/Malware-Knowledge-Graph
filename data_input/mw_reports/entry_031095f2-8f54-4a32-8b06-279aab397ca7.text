[Update History]
- At 2017-12-05 18:56:40 UTC, 2 hours after our blog goes live, we observed the C2
sending kill scan command to the bots, and that explains why the scan activities on
the two ports started to drop on a global scale.
- The C2 address 95.211.123.69:7654 is the typo for 95.211.123.69:7645

In our last blog, we mentioned there were almost 100k unique scanner IPs from Argentina
scanning port 2323 and port 23, and we concluded it was a new mirai variant. For the last
few days, the scanning behavior has gotten more intense, and more countries started to
show up on our ScanMon platform as scan source. We have been able to dig more into this
situation and see some bigger picture, and realized that the 2323|23 scan is only a piece of a
big puzzler, while we are still doing more in-depth research into this matter, we bumped into
a new situation today which we think needs some immediate attention from the security
community, so here is a very brief and rough write-up.
About 12 hours ago (2017-12-05 11:57 AM GMT+8), we noticed a new version of Satori (a
mirai variant which we named Satori), starting to propagate very quickly on port 37215 and
52869. This new variant has two significant differences from known mirai variants:
The bot itself now does NOT rely on loader|scanner mechanism to perform remote
planting, instead, bot itself performs the scan activity. This worm like behavior is quite
significant.
Two new exploits, which work on port 37215 and 52869 have been added, see below
for more details. Due to the worm like behavior, we all should be on the lookout for the
port 37215 and 52869 scan traffic. (For those who don’t have the visibility, feel free to
check out our free Scanmon system for port 37215 and 52869, or ISC port pages for
37215 and 52869.
This malware is the newest version of Satori. We have been tracking Satori for months,
and have strong evidence this new wave of attack can be linked to previous attack on port 23
and 2323 scanning traffic upticks.

1/4

The scanning IP (aka, the bot) numbers are now climbing straight up. For example, during
last recent 12 hours we have seen 263,250 different IPs scanning port 37215, and 19,403
IPs scanning port 52869.

The Malware Sample and the C2s

We have collected following samples from our honeypot.

Satori borrows code from mirai with some major changes.
there are 3 C2s in the sample e1411cc1726afe6fb8d09099c5fb2fa6 we got,
95.211.123.69:7645
network.bigbotpein.com:23
control.almashosting.ru
Note: the only working c2 is 95.211.123.69:7645, the other network.bigbotpein.com:23 and
control.almashosting.ru is not actually being used here, they might be there just to trick
security researcher to connect to the wrong C2s. (Note again, we also have old samples, as

2/4

well as some fresh new samples coming in, in which control.almashosting.ru is really been
used.)
The Scanning Activity

As can be seen from the following picture, the bot will scan port 37215 and 52869 randomly,
determined by the remainder of a random integer mod 3.

The Exploits

During the scanning, Satori will utilize two different exploits, one on port 37215, while the
other on 52869.
The one on port 37215 is not fully disclosed yet, our team has been tracking this in the
last few days and got quite some insight, but we will not discuss it here right now.(stay
tuned for our update later).
The one on port 52869 is derived from CVE-2014-8361.
Not only are Satori penetrating with these exploits, but they also drive infected devices to
download themselves from the same original download URL. This makes a loop, and causes
Satori spreading in a worm manner.
The Connection to Previous Port 23 and 2323 Scanning Upticks

In our previous blog, we have mentioned an upticks on port 23 and 2323 scanning traffic in
Argentina.
Actually, in the next few days, more countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, Columbia have been
picked up by our monitoring system, as we mentioned in the beginning of this blogpost, our
investigation reveals the port scan is only part of the whole picture.
3/4

Right now we just want to point out that the 2323|23 attacks and today Satori’s attack shares
some common factors, for example, the samples’ name and static features, some of the C2
protocols and sharing of the same exploits. These make we believe they two are connected.
We will share more details on our blog later on.
IoC
Samples in This Wave

Satori is evolving as of our writing, we have capture some more samples with difference
c2..etc, so here is only some of the IoCs.
