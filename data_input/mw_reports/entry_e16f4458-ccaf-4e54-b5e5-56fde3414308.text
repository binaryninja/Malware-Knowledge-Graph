Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool (EOMT)
This script contains mitigations to help address the following vulnerabilities.

1/8

CVE-2021-26855
This is the most effective way to help quickly protect and mitigate your
Exchange Servers prior to patching. We recommend this script over the
previous ExchangeMitigations.ps1 script. The Exchange On-premises
Mitigation Tool automatically downloads any dependencies and runs the
Microsoft Safety Scanner. This a better approach for Exchange deployments
with Internet access and for those who want an attempt at automated
remediation. We have not observed any impact to Exchange Server
functionality via these mitigation methods. EOMT.ps1 is completely automated
and uses familiar mitigation methods previously documented. This script has
four operations it performs:
+NEW Check for the latest version of EOMT and download it.
Mitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 via a URL
Rewrite configuration
Scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner
Attempt to remediate compromises detected by the Microsoft Safety
Scanner.
This a better approach for Exchange deployments with Internet access and for
those who want an attempt at automated remediation. We have not observed
any impact to Exchange Server functionality via these mitigation methods nor
do these mitigation methods make any direct changes that disable features of
Exchange.
Use of the Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool and the Microsoft Saftey
Scanner are subject to the terms of the Microsoft Privacy Statement:
https://aka.ms/privacy

Requirements to run the Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool
External Internet Connection from your Exchange server (required to
download the Microsoft Safety Scanner and the IIS URL Rewrite Module).
PowerShell script must be run as Administrator.

System Requirements
PowerShell 3 or later
IIS 7.5 and later
Exchange 2013, 2016, or 2019
Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016,
Server 2019

2/8

+New If Operating System is older than Windows Server 2016, must
have KB2999226 for IIS Rewrite Module 2.1 to work.

Who should run the Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool
Situation

Guidance

If you have done nothing to
date to patch or mitigate this
issue…

Run EOMT.PS1 as soon as possible.This will
both attempt to remediate as well as mitigate
your servers against further attacks. Once
complete, follow patching guidance to update
your servers on http://aka.ms/exchangevulns

If you have mitigated using
any/all of the mitigation
guidance Microsoft has
given
(Exchangemitigations.Ps1,
Blog post, etc..)

Run EOMT.PS1 as soon as possible. This will
both attempt to remediate as well as mitigate
your servers against further attacks. Once
complete, follow patching guidance to update
your servers on http://aka.ms/exchangevulns

If you have already patched
your systems and are
protected, but did NOT
investigate for any
adversary activity, indicators
of compromise, etc….

Run EOMT.PS1 as soon as possible. This will
attempt to remediate any existing
compromise that may not have been full
remediated before patching.

If you have already patched
and investigated your
systems for any indicators of
compromise, etc….

No action is required

Important note regarding Microsoft Safety Scanner
The Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool runs the Microsoft Safety Scanner
in a quick scan mode. If you suspect any compromise, we highly recommend
you run it in the FULL SCAN mode. FULL SCAN mode can take a long time but
if you are not running Microsoft Defender AV as your default AV, FULL SCAN
will be required to remediate threats.

Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool Examples
The default recommended way of using EOMT.ps1. This will determine if your
server is vulnerable, mitigate if vulnerable, and run MSERT in quick scan
mode. If the server is not vulnerable only MSERT quick scan will run.
.\EOMT.ps1

3/8

To run a Full MSERT Scan - We only recommend this option only if the initial
quick scan discovered threats. The full scan may take hours or days to
complete.
.\EOMT.ps1 -RunFullScan -DoNotRunMitigation

To run the Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool with MSERT in detect only
mode - MSERT will not remediate detected threats.
.\EOMT.ps1 -DoNotRemediate

To roll back the Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool mitigations
.\EOMT.ps1 -Rollbackmitigation

Note: If ExchangeMitigations.ps1 was used previously to apply mitigations, Use
ExchangeMitigations.ps1 for rollback.
+NEW EOMT will now autoupdate by downloading the latest version from
GitHub. To prevent EOMT from fetching updates to EOMT.ps1 from the
internet.
.\EOMT.ps1 -DoNotAutoUpdateEOMT

Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool Q & A
Question: What mode should I run EOMT.ps1 in by default?
Answer: By default, EOMT.ps1 should be run without any parameters:
This will run the default mode which does the following:
1. Checks if your server is vulnerable based on the presence of the SU
patch or Exchange version.
2. Downloads and installs the IIS URL rewrite tool (only if vulnerable).
3. Applies the URL rewrite mitigation (only if vulnerable).
4. Runs the Microsoft Safety Scanner in "Quick Scan" mode (vulnerable or
not).
Question: What if I run a full scan and it’s affecting the resources of my
servers?
Answer: You can terminate the process of the scan by running the following
command in an Administrative PowerShell session.
Stop-Process -Name msert

4/8

Question: What is the real difference between this script (EOMT.PS1) and the
previous script Microsoft released (ExchangeMitigations.Ps1).
Answer: The Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool was released to help pull
together multiple mitigation and response steps, whereas the previous script
simply enabled mitigations. Some details on what each do:
EOMT.PS1
Mitigation of CVE-2021-26855 via a URL Rewrite configuration.
Mitigation does not impact Exchange functionality.
Malware scan of the Exchange Server via the Microsoft Safety Scanner
Attempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats.
ExchangeMitigations.ps1:
Does mitigations for all 4 CVE’s - CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857,
CVE-2021-27065 & CVE-2021-26858.
Some of the mitigation methods impact Exchange functionality.
Does not do any scanning for existing compromise or exploitation.
Does not take response actions to existing active identified threats.
Question: What if I do not have an external internet connection from my
Exchange server?
Answer: If you do not have an external internet connection, you can still use
the legacy script (ExchangeMitigations.ps1) and other steps from the mitigation
blog post: Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities Mitigations – March 2021
Question: If I have already ran the mitigations previously, will the Exchange
On-premises Mitigation Tool roll back any of the mitigations?
Answer: No, please use the legacy script (ExchangeMitigations.ps1) to do
rollback. The legacy script supports rollback for the mitigations the Exchange
On-premises Mitigation Tool applied.

Test-ProxyLogon.ps1
Formerly known as Test-Hafnium, this script automates all four of the
commands found in the Hafnium blog post. It also has a progress bar and
some performance tweaks to make the CVE-2021-26855 test run much faster.
Download the latest release here:
Download Test-ProxyLogon.ps1

5/8

Usage
The most typical usage of this script is to check all Exchange servers and save
the reports, by using the following syntax from Exchange Management Shell:
Get-ExchangeServer | .\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath
$home\desktop\logs

To check the local server only, just run the script:
.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs

To check the local server and copy the identified logs and files to the OutPath:
.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs -CollectFiles

To display the results without saving them, pass -DisplayOnly:
.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -DisplayOnly

Frequently Asked Questions
The script says it found suspicious files, and it lists a bunch of zip files.
What does this mean?
The script will flag any zip/7x/rar files that it finds in ProgramData. As noted in
this blog post, web shells have been observed using such files for exfiltration.
An administrator should review the files to determine if they are valid.
Determining if a zip file is a valid part of an installed product is outside the
scope of this script, and whitelisting files by name would only encourage the
use of those specific names by attackers.
I'm having trouble running the script on Exchange 2010.
If PowerShell 3 is present, the script can be run on Exchange 2010. It will not
run-on PowerShell 2. One can also enable PS Remoting and run the script
remotely against Exchange 2010. However, the script has minimal functionality
in these scenarios, as Exchange 2010 is only affected by one of the four
announced exploits - CVE-2021-26857. Further, this exploit is only available if
the Unified Messaging role is present. As a result, it is often easier to simply
run the Get-EventLog command from the blog post, rather than using TestProxyLogon.
