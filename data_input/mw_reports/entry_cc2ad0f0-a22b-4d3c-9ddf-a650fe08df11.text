The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a Flash Alert warning
that the RagnarLocker ransomware gang has breached the networks of at least fifty-two
organizations from multiple critical infrastructure sectors across the United States. This is
the second FBI alert released for the RagnarLocker Ransomware variant, the last alert was
released in November 2020.
The following FBI flash alerts will focus on providing indicators of compromise (IOCs) that
organizations can use to detect and block RagnarLocker ransomware attacks.

November 2020 FBI Alert (PDF) - RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise
RagnarLocker ransomware first appeared in the wild at the end of December 2019 as part
of a campaign against compromised networks targeted by its operators. The actors behind
RagnarLocker will perform reconnaissance on the targeted network, exfiltrate sensitive
information, encrypt files, and then notify the victim the stolen files will be released to the
public if the ransom is not paid. The threat actor behind the malware is known in previous
attacks to ask for millions of dollars in payment and creates a ransom note that includes the
company name. The ransomware enumerates all running services on the infected host and
stops services that contain a specific string. Ragnar is small compared to other malware
and is written in the C/C++ programming language.

Recommended Steps to Prevent Initial Access
The threat actors behind the RagnarLocker attacks often gain entry by compromising the
company’s network via the RDP service, using brute force attacks to guess weak
passwords or with stolen credentials purchased on the Dark Web.
After gaining access the exploitation of CVE-2017-0213 is used to elevate privileges,
patching of this CVE is critical.
Reviewing the CVEs for all Public Facing Systems – CISA regularly updates and
maintains a full list of CVEs that are known to be exploited: CISA: KNOWN
EXPLOITED VULNERABILITIES CATALOG
Over 90% of successful cyber-attacks begin with a phishing email and has been a
technique used by RagnarLocker, it is critical to continually monitor for spearphishing
campaigns with malicious attachments and links.
Communication – Along with monitoring, educating end users on what they
could be receiving in their email can help them spot phishing campaigns before
they click or download.
Review Indicators of Compromise in FBI alerts and block the malicious IP addresses
observed in previous attacks.

Blocking RagnarLocker Attacks with Endpoint Security

4/10

Trellix ENS is currently detecting RagnarLocker Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with
signature detections and the malware behavior associated with RagnarLocker Ransomware
attacks. The following Adaptive Threat Protection Rules in ENS have shown success in
stopping the techniques associated with RagnarLocker. Trellix always recommends testing
in Report Only Mode before blocking to confirm no false positives are detected by this
behavioral rule.
Coverage
Minimum AMCore Content: 4217
Adaptive Threat Protection Rule ID 239: Identify suspicious command parameter
execution (Mitre-T1059: Identifies the suspicious execution of an application through
command line parameters).
Adaptive Threat Protection Rule ID 341: Identify and block patterns being used in
Ransomware attacks in security rule group assignments.

RagnarLocker Threat Intelligence from the Trellix Advanced Threat
Research Team and MVISION Insights
MVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for
RagnarLocker Ransomware. MVISION Insights will alert to detections and Process Traces
that have been observed and systems that require additional attention to prevent
widespread infection. MVISION Insights will also include Hunting Rules for threat hunting
and further intelligence gathering of the threat activity and adversary.

Detecting Malicious Activity with MVISION EDR
MVISION EDR is currently monitoring for the activity associated with RagnarLocker
Ransomware and will note the MITRE techniques and any suspicious indicators related to
the adversarial activity. Analysis of RagnarLocker malware samples note the usage of
native Windows APIs, Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe), and the
deletion of Shadow Copy to inhibit system recovery.
