Victims of the Nemty Ransomware finally have something to be happy about as researchers
have released a decryptor that allows them to recover files for free.
Since August 2019, the Nemty Ransomware has been utilizing a variety of distribution
methods [1, 2, 3] to infect victims and encrypt their files.
The good news is that victims finally get to fight back as researchers from the security
firm Tesorion have created a decryptor that works on Nemty versions 1.4 and 1.6, with 1.5
coming soon.

1/7

The decryptor currently supports only a limited amount of file extensions, but Tesorion has
told BleepingComputer that they are expanding support for more file types every day.
The file types currently supported by the decryptor are:
avi, bmp, gif, mp3, jpeg, jpg, mov, mp4, mov, mp4, qt, 3gp, mpeg, mpg, doc, docb,
dot, ole, pot, pps, ppt, wbk, xlm, xls, xlsb, xlt, pdf, png, tif, tiff, nef, , doc,
txt, docm, docx, dotm, dotx, jar, potm, potx, ppsm, ppsx, pptm, pptx, xlsm, xlsx,
xltm, xltx, zip

Instead of offering a decryptor that computes a key on a victim's computer, Tesorion opted
to have the decryption key generation done on their own servers.
Tesorion told BleepingComputer they went this route in order to prevent the ransomware
developers from analyzing the decryptor and learning the weakness in their algorithm.
The researchers are not wrong, either, as the ransomware developers are definitely
watching as shown by the inclusion of the "tesorion thanks for your article" string in the
latest Nemty 1.6 executable.

Decrypting Nemty encrypted files

2/7

Tesorion provided BleepingComputer with their decryptor so that we would test its ability to
decrypt Nemty encrypted files and in our tests it was able to decrypt most of the more
common file types that people commonly use such as Office documents, videos, and
images.
When using the decryptor, users will upload an encrypted file to Tesorion's server. The
supported files that can be uploaded are either a docx, .gif, .pdf, .png, .pptx, .xlsx, or .zip
file.
Once a file is uploaded, Tesorian's servers will compute the decryption key for the uploaded
file and send it back and load into the decryptor.
Once loaded, victims can then select the folder or drive that they wish to decrypt and begin
recovering their files.

Decrypted Files
In the earlier builds shared with BleepingComputer, we hit some issues on certain file types.
With the latest release tested today, the decryptor worked very well and was able to recover
most of the encrypted files on my test machine.
The only files it was not able to decrypt were non-standard file formats, but as previously
stated, Tesorion continues to support new file types every day.

3/7

In order to download the decryptor, users can contact the Tesorion CSIRT and request help
with the Nemty Ransomware. Tesorion will then send a link to the decryptor that will allow
you to decrypt your files.
Tesorion has told us that they are currently working with Europol to get their decryptor on
the NoMoreRansom site so that it will become more widely available to victims.
