A deeper look at Tofsee modules
cert.pl/en/news/single/a-deeper-look-at-tofsee-modules/

Tofsee is a multi-purpose malware with wide array of capabilities – it can mine bitcoins, send
emails, steal credentials, perform DDoS attacks, and more. All of this is possible because of
its modular nature.
We have already published about Tofsee/Gheg a few months ago –
https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/tofsee-en. Reading or at least skimming it is probably
required to fully understand this post. Note that it is meant as an extension of that research,
focusing on plugin functionality that we previously ignored. We will shortly summarize each
plugin and highlight its most important features.
The post is rather long – for the impatient, list of hashes and table of contents in one:

1. ddosR.dll
Original filename: p:\cmf5\small2\plugins\plg_ddos\ddos.cpp
This plugin can perform DDOS attacks. Implemented attacks are not very complicated, for
example request spamming (HTTP Flood):
Or plain old SYN flood (using PassThru driver, aka grabb module).
We haven’t observed any DDoS activity from Tofsee yet, so this plugin is probably not used
by the botmaster.
Configuration from the C&C for this plugin is very simple:
The binary contains a lot of strings, what simplifies analysis greatly:

2. antibot.dll
Original filename: z:\cmf5\small2\plugins\plg_antibot\plugin.cpp
Now, this is an interesting plugin, because it removes other malware from victim’s computer.

2/9

It can:
enumerate processes and kill ones that may be dangerous (search by configured
names)
search SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Browser Helper
Objects registry branch, and remove bad browser helper objects
enumerate mutexes and kill processes that own them (search by mutex names).
List of browser helper objects removed by this module (downloaded from C&C):

3. snrpR.dll
Original filename: p:\\cmf5\\small2\\plugins\\plg_sniff\\sniff.cpp
Related config section:
Communication is sniffed and replaced using PassThru driver (accessible through named
pipe “\\\\.\\PassThru”)
mail.sniff enables stealing mail addresses from incoming e-mails. Mail
addresses are stolen from “From” and “To” fields. It also looks for entities
“%40″,”#64″,”#064” in content (looking for “@” char).
ftp.sniff and pop.sniff enables POP3 and FTP credentials stealing. The plugin is
looking for “user” and “pass” protocol commands, gets authentication data and
sends through Passthru driver.
mail.replace functionality replaces incoming e-mails using a specified template
(stored in ‘mailbody’ key of config)
Template example that we received (despite this function being turned off right now):
It leaves original “From” and “To” headers (%FROM_LINE, %TO_LINE), has the ability to
leave original subject (%SUBJ, %_SUBJ), and original timestamps (%DATE, %P5DATE,
%M5DATE).

4. proxyR.dll
Original filename: p:\\cmf5\\small2\\plugins\\plg_proxy\\plugin.cpp
This plugin listens for TCP connections on 0.0.0.0:1080 and provides multithreaded SOCKS
proxy server. The sample we analyzed identifies itself in Proxy-Agent HTTP header as
WinRoute Pro/4.1.
Traffic is redirected to addresses specified at a proxy_cfg section, separately for each region.

3/9

Addresses are specified as a reference to a work_srv list or directly.
In proxy_cfg we can also find some defined timeouts for a socket.
When any value is missing in configuration, binary has some sane defaults inside.
Plugin also adds port mapping using UPNP, disguising itself as Skype:
Strings from the binary give a little more insight about the purpose of this plugin:

6. protect.dll
Original filename: z:\cmf5\small2\plugins\plg_protect\plugin.cpp
This plugin downloads and installs malicious service in system:
Malicious service binary is obfuscated with “state-of-the-art encryption algorithm” – i.e.
negating every byte:
Md5 of decrypted backdoor = 49642f1d1b1673a40f5fa6263a66d056. This file is protected by
packer, and it’s the only packed binary that we observed during our analysis of Tofsee – it
suggests that the binary could’ve been created by another actor and reused in Tofsee.

7. locsR.dll
Original filename: z:\cmf5\cmf5\small2\plugins\plg_locs\plg.cpp
This plugin steals network credentials for Microsoft Outlook:
After extracting them from the registry, they are decrypted and used to send more emails.
Additionally, it generates email in form [computer name]@mail.ru and attempts to send
emails using it (with raw SMTP protocol).
Strings from binary:

10. hostR.dll
This is HTTP server plugin. It masquerades as Apache/2.2.15 (Win32). It can serve files,
probably for other bots.
It is able to blacklist some IPs – probably security analysts (for example Forcepoint and
Google are banned).
Configuration for this module, fetched from the C&C:

11. text.dll
4/9

Original filename: p:\cmf5\small2\plugins\plg_text\plg_text.cpp
Very short plugin, it is able to process email templates downloaded from C&C.

12. smtp.dll
Very important module – it generates and sends emails. It’s probably biggest module and
code is rather complicated sometimes.
Most interesting thing about it is the fact that it uses its own dedicated scripting language for
generating messages. Script example, received from C&C:
If someone recognizes this as a real scripting language, we’d be grateful for the information.
We have never seen something like this, so we analyzed interpreter of this language.
The syntax is rather simple, but very assemblish and primitive. We hope that malware
authors are generating this scripts from a higher level language because writing something
like this must really hurt one’s sanity ;].
A lot of opcodes are supported – take a look at this (simplified) parsing function for example:
We didn’t reverse all of them, but few most important ones are:
C ip:port – Connect
L lbl – Create Label lbl.
J lbl – Jump to label lbl.
v name value – Create variable name and assign value value.
W text – Write something to output – in this case to final email.
I lbl condition – If condition is satisfied than jump to lbl
Additionally wrapping text in “”” allows for newlines and escape sequences in it, and
__v(XX)__ is a variable interpolation.
Again, few from the most interesting strings from that binary:
We thought that IfYouAreReadingThisYouHaveTooMuchFreeTime is an easter egg for us,
malware analysts, but it turns out that it’s just a strange quirk related to hotmail
authentication.
Configuration for this module, fetched from C&C:

13. blist.dll
This plugin checks if a bot is listed as a spambot and blacklisted. In the config we observed
following DNSBLs (DNS-based Blackhole Lists) were supplied:

5/9

DNSBL is a service based on DNS used for publishing IP addresses of spam senders. If
spam server uses DNSBL filters, it will do a DNS request to DNSBL domain with each
incoming SMTP connection. Technical details are outside of the scope of this post, but any
interested reader can take a look at http://www.us.sorbs.net/using.shtml or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL.
Checking DNSBL is implemented with gethostbyname:
Configuration for this module, fetched from C&C:

14. miner.dll
This is (as the name suggests) cryptocurrency miner. This plugin only coordinates the work,
but it has few accompanying binaries, that perform the dirty work.
One binary, called grabb, is distributed straight from the C&C. Other binaries are
downloadable through URLs specified in configs – in theory. In practice, servers distributing
miners seem to be dead, so we were not able to download miners.
Miner “verifies” that has really downloaded right binary, but hashing was probably too difficult
for malware creators to implement, so they settled on size verification – for example, they are
check that cores_gt_1 binary has exactly 223744 bytes.
We didn’t analyze it in-depth because crypto miners are boring enough, and strings from
binary give enough information about inner workings anyway:
And the rest can be read from the configuration, fetched from C&C:

15. img.dll
This short plugin processes malicious attachments – encodes them with base64 and
appends to emails.
Nothing interesting here, as can be seen in hardcoded strings:
Configuration for this module, fetched from the C&C:

16. spread.dll
First, it extracts xs, datr, c_user (and more) cookies.
Exact method depends on the browser, but generally plugin reads cookies stored on disk by
the browser – for example cookies.sqlite from \Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles, for Firefox. Supported
browsers are Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.
After that, plugin uses that cookies to impersonate user in facebook API:
6/9

List of friends is downloaded through API and a message is sent to them. Format of
message is stored in configuration, for example:
‘fb.message1’: ‘%SPRD_TEXT1|%LANG_ID| %SPRD_URL1’
Twitter is handled very similarly: cookies are stolen, followers are downloaded by API call to
https://twitter.com/followers, and messages are sent.
VKontakte also seems to be supported, but that functionality is optional and held in another
plugin. This module only checks if VK is enabled in config and calls handler (that can be
initialized from another plugin), if it’s defined. Malware creators usually don’t like to attack
Russia, so this function is disabled and VKontakte plugin is not distributed.
Plugin can also spread itself through Skype, but reverse engineering Skype protocol was
clearly too hard for malware authors, so plugin waits until Skype is started, and then sends
windows messages to Skype window:
The plugin has dozens of strings hardcoded, so analyzing it in disassembler is a breeze. Few
more interesting groups:
References to the OCR plugin – to avoid captchas:
Facebook cookies:
Strings related to Facebook spread:
Strings related to cookie stealing:
Strings related to Skype hijacking:
Twitter cookies:
And Twitter spread:
Finally, things needed to send stolen cookies somewhere:
Rich functionality means rich configuration from the C&C:

17. spread2.dll
This plugin uses methods more than 15 years old, and tries to spread Tofsee through…
infected USB drives! This doesn’t sound like an effective idea for A.D. 2017, but despite that,
the plugin is still enabled.
First it copies malicious binary into RECYCLER\<random_gibberish>.exe file on the USB
drive, then sets READONLY and SYSTEM attributes on that file, and finally writes malicious
autorun.inf file:
7/9

The malicious binary that will be spread is downloaded from the internet (see also sys.dll
plugin and %FIREURL variable).
Nothing too interesting in hardcoded strings, except operation logs:
Configuration for this module, fetched from the C&C:

18. sys.dll
This plugin seems to be a downloader or rather an updater. It sends requests, depending on
a value of the %FIREURL configuration variable.
Example values of the %FIREURL variable (one per line):
Variables are expanded recursively, and %SYS_RN means \r\n of course, so first possible
value can be read as:
If we send this request to that IP address on port 80, we will get yet another malicious binary.
Different requests lead to different binaries.
If a request is invalid, or not supported, following image is sent instead:

We appreciate the humor.
Nothing surprising in hardcoded strings:
8/9

Configuration for this module, fetched from the C&C:
Additionally the %FIREURL variable from config is used.

19. webb.dll
This plugin tries to locate iexplore.exe process. If this succeeds, it injects DLL file called
IEStub.dll to this process.
IEStub.dll hooks a lot of functions from iexplorer. List of hooked functions:
Hooks intercept called functions and can change their parameters. We haven’t analyzed
hooks in depth, but most of them seem to be loggers intercepting “interesting” data from
parameters – We haven’t observed any web injects served by Tofsee.
For completeness, interesting hardcoded strings:
Configuration for this module, fetched from the C&C:

20. P2P.dll
Original filename: p:\cmf5\small2\plugins\plg_p2p\plg_p2p.cpp
This plugin is rather short. Despite promising name, it’s rather boring – opening a port on a
router and listening for connection is the most important thing it does. It doesn’t implement
any commands, this is left for the main module to handle.
Like almost every module, it logs to %TMP%\log_%s.txt, and when this fails falls back to
C:\log.txt.
Also adds port mapping using UPnP, in the same way as plugin 4 (proxyR.dll).
Configuration for this module, fetched from the C&C:
Interesting strings:
