Key Findings
This research focuses on the ‘Mail-O’ malware used against the FSB and other
Russian government organizations, detailed in the May 2021 FSB NKTsKI and
Rostelecom-Solar report.
Early armchair commentary presumed that given the targets, this attack would
undoubtedly be the work of a Western government, Five Eyes, or the United States.
Our analysis disproves that hypothesis.
Instead, we present the argument that the Mail-O malware is a variant of a relatively
well-known malware called PhantomNet or SManager used by a threat actor ‘TA428’
Previous reporting on TA428 points to Chinese origin and details a history of attacks
against South East Asian and Russian targets.

In May 2021, the Russian Federal Security Service’s National Coordination Center for
Computer Incidents (NKTsKI) in coordination with Rostelecom announced that several
Russian government institutions had been victims of an APT campaign. While the Russian
government has made a similar announcement before, it’s the first time they’ve accompanied
it with a moderately detailed technical analysis. Several researchers, myself included,
jumped on the opportunity to write our YARA rules and hope for a glimpse at the culprit.
The InfoSec twitterverse needed no such artifacts as blind speculation immediately pointed
at a Western government, Five Eyes, or the United States as de facto culprits. I think we’ll be
relieved to find out that was most likely not the case – if solely because we’ve come to
expect a higher standard for Western malware development.
Initial attempts to find the samples were fruitless but that changed this past weekend as
some kind soul (or more likely a bulk autosubmitter) uploaded a copy of the ‘Mail-O’ malware
to VirusTotal. We track this activity under the name ‘ThunderCats’.

In line with the findings of the NKTsKI-Rostelecom report, the Mail-O malware acts as a
downloader with a thin veneer of similarity to the legitimate Mail.ru Disk-O software. The
disguise consists of a version number (“19.05.0045”) lifted from a legitimate Disk-O
executable and the use of a real Mail.ru to post victim details and host a next stage payload.
The executable is bulked up to 2.8MB by statically linking both libcurl 7.64.1 and OpenSSL.
Focus becomes important to avoid going down a pointless rabbithole of reversing unrelated
open-source code. For that reason, we should focus primarily on the exported functions.
The Mail-O malware exports two functions, Entery and ServiceMain :

Mail-O malware’s exported functions

Mail-O: ServiceMain

ServiceMain function pseudocode
ServiceMain takes a service name as an argument and attempts to register a service
control handler with a specific HandlerProc function meant to check and set the status of
that service. With a valid service status handle, Mail-O detaches the calling process from its
console, changes the service status values to reflect its current running state, and calls the
Entery function. Note the ServiceMain function with the debug string “ServiceMain
Load” – a template that comes into play in looking for connections to other malware.

Mail-O: Entery
The Entery function is called at the end of ServiceMain , but it can also be
independently invoked. It checks for the presence of ‘%AllUsersProfile%PSEXESVC.EXE’
and launches it as a process. This function is registered as a top level exception filter.

3/7

Mail-O PSEXESVC.exe check function
The main Entery logic is orchestrated in the next function. First, Mail-O checks the registry
for an existing install of the legitimate Mail.Ru Disk-O software. It decrypts configuration
strings and contacts https://dispatcher.cloud.mail.ru/ .
Mail-O uses the SystemTime to POST the encrypted victim hostname (or in its absence the
string “[none]”) and receive a payload. The payload is written to a temporary path before
being launched. Mail-O then goes into a sleep loop until a predetermined amount of time.
We’ve yet to see ‘Webdav-O’, the other malware component described in the RostelecomSolar report. However, that shouldn’t keep us from following an interesting lead.

The ‘Entery’ Connection

Mail-O exports a function called Entery , presumably a misspelling of ‘Entry’. Misspellings
are a true gift for malware researchers. As it turns out, this isn’t the first time that misspelling
has been noted in a recently deployed piece of malware.
In December 2020, Ignacio Sanmillan and Matthieu Faou released an excellent report on a
Vietnamese supply-chain attack that used PhantomNet (aka SManager) malware. The
researchers noted that the malware’s persistence was established via a scheduled task that
called the malicious DLL’s export, ‘Entery’. The researchers note that this same export was
pointed out by NTT Security in their analysis of TManger malware, which they in turn
correlate with Proofpoint’s ‘TA428’ threat actor. That nondescript threat actor name is
adopted by Dr. Web in reporting recent attacks against additional Russian targets including
research institutes.
While that might all seem a bit convoluted, I rehearse the logical connections to illustrate two
points:

5/7

1. There’s an established history of this very non-Western ‘threat actor’ in targeting both
Asian and Russian targets.
2. These presumably Chinese clusters of activity are confusing and difficult to
disentangle. Tooling is likely shared among multiple threat actors (likely including
PhantomNet/SManager), and what’s being referred to as ‘TA428’ is probably an
amalgam of multiple threat groups.
For skeptics, we’ve provided a YARA rule below for the Entery overlap, which entails not
just the export function name but also the general layout of the function and some shared
strings. Note that the layout has likely developed iteratively from an open-source template.
Finally, while I’m quick to disparage the quality of the malware as not up to some exalted
Western standard, it’s important to note that ThunderCats (and the larger TA428 umbrella)
are pulling off custom-tailored region-specific supply chain attacks, successfully punching
way above their weight in their intelligence collection efforts, and they should not be
underestimated as an adversary.
