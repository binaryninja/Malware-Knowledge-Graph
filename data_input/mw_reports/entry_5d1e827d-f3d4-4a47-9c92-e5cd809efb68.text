Feature-rich remote access malware Pekraut emerges. The rodent seems to be of German origin and is ready to be released. We
analyzed the malware in-depth.
While searching for new malware via suspicious pathes, a fake svchost.exe in %APPDATA%/Microsoft tipped us off. The sample[1] is a
.NET application which is packed with ConfuserEx. The file was uploaded as netRat.exe to Virustotal. The same name is also stated in
the file's version information as InternalName and OriginalFilename. Version information also has a copyright statement for 2019.

Via similarity search we found a second sample[2] that was uploaded to Virustotal a day later. It is not packed but obfuscated with
Dotfuscator. Unpacking the ConfuserEx sample[1] results in a file that is almost the same as the second sample[2].
The obfuscation removed the original names of .NET symbols like classes, variables and methods. We didn't find any non-obfuscated
Pekraut sample, so we manually named the symbols based on their usage resulting in sample[3]. The deobfuscated sample[3] is also
used for screenshots in this article. Please note that those symbol names aren't part of the original source code and thus do not suffice
for signatures.

Pekraut RAT's command list
Pekraut's client accepts 27 commands. The help command sends a German description for every command to the server. The
commands themselves are still English, though.
Some commands aren't exactly offering what the explanations are saying. E.g. the dbg command is not fully implemented.
The class responsible for managing all commands has seven placeholder objects in the command listing (see image below). The
reason is most likely just a quirky way to place a newline when printing the help string of all commands.

2/7

To sum up, the whole RAT is quite function-rich and fully implemented except for the debugging option. Malware authors are not
excempt from being so confident in their code that precautionary steps are neglected.
The table below sums up our analysis of the actual implementation for the commands.

on.

pc_shutdown

Shuts down the PC.

sysinfo

Sends information like the machine name, the username, the OS and processor architecture, the screen
count, the webcam count and the microphone count to the server.

dbg

Option to start an endless-loop. Supposed to debug the client but not fully implemented yet.

exit

Disconnects from the server and terminates itself.

help

Sends all commands / the description of a command to the server.

client_err

Sends the last error to the server.

tasks

Sends currently executed commands to the server and has the option to terminate them.

client_install

Installs / uninstalls the client by using the procedure outlined in PekrautRAT's install / uninstall routine.

UAC bypass via ComputerDefaults.exe
Pekraut RAT uses a Windows 10 UAC bypass which utilizes ComputerDefaults.exe. The bypass was first mentioned in October 2018
on Packetstormsecurity by Fabien Dromas. It works is as follows:
1. Creating the registry key [HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command]
2. Creating the value [HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\DelegateExecute] with no data.

3/7

3. Setting the [HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\(default)] value with the data provided by the server. The
data is the program to be launched with admin rights.
4. Launching ComputerDefaults.exe.
ComputerDefaults.exe will now execute the program since the DelegateExecute value is present. After launching
ComputerDefaults.exe, Pekraut will remove all registry traces of the UAC bypass.

Pekraut RAT's install / uninstall routine
Pekraut RAT contains an installation and uninstallation routine. This Pekraut sample fakes svchost.exe and an update for Internet
Explorer.

Installation
1. Copies itself to
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\svchost.exe
2. The file attributes of svchost.exe are set to hidden and system. This will make the file invisible from a normal directory listing and
makes it part of the system files.
3. The registry value [HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell] by default contains the string
"explorer.exe". Pekraut appends ",%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\svchost.exe" to the string. That means after
logging in, explorer.exe and the fake svchost.exe will be executed.
4. A windows shortcut file is created at C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\IExplorerUpdate.lnk. It points to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\svchost.exe.
Since the drive for the shortcut location is hardcoded, this won't work on any systems that are not installed on drive C:
5. Lastly, it pings 8.8.8.8 a three times to pass time, then deletes its original file and start it's copy
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\svchost.exe.

4/7

Part of Pekraut's installation routine that sets a Windows shortcut and adds the executable to Winlogon Shell

Uninstallation
1. Restores the default for the registry value [HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell] by setting the
data to "explorer.exe".
2. Deletes the previously created shortcut.
3. Lastly, pings 8.8.8.8 to pass time and then deletes itself.

Install and uninstall settings
Install and uninstall routines use nine different flags that make it possible to turn certain behaviour on and off easily. There are also four
public static strings that denote the install location, install subfolder, name of the copied files and name of the windows shortcut. Those
flags and strings are most likely to be set via a malware builder. A summary is in the screenshot below. As you can see all flags are
turned on for our sample except the useInstallSubFolder option. If it was turned on, the file would be copied to the location
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\<installSubFolder>\svchost.exe

Connection routine of Pekraut
Pekraut RAT sets up a socket connection to the server. The connection details are provided in the configuration class (see picture
below).

5/7

The threat actor uses the portfowarding service portmap.io to hide the real IP address of their server. Possibly the server is even the
actors home desktop machine.
The RAT has different data classes to send or receive the following types of data: a new password for encryption, keystrokes, text,
images, audio, video, errors, files or authentication info.
Text data is encrypted via AES with the password in the configuration. Other data is compressed via zlib.

Pekraut RAT is an upcoming threat
We didn't see any other samples in the wild so far but there are indications that this malware is just about to be released.
The version number stated in the configuration is 1.1
The RAT is feature-rich and prepared to be created en masse in modified versions by a builder
Once a builder is available for criminals, more versions of the malware will be found in the wild
The way of persistence via fake svchost and a fake Internet Explorer update excludes any benign use as remote access tool
