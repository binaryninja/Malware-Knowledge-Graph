So Long (Go)Daddy | Tracking BlackTech Infrastructure

Summary
BlackTech has built a reputation relying on (much to the delight of defenders) tech-themed
domains and predictable registration patterns. Recent reporting linking malicious domains to
the actor suggests these patterns may be fading, at least for the time being signifying a
departure from the previous infrastructure configuration.

Items to Note
Failure to redact email addresses within WHOIS records (mitsumori.gb@gmail[.]com,
wufi2011@gmail[.]com, siraiya128@gmail[.]com, senotice@gmail[.]com) leads to
dozens more domains likely linked to the actor(s).
BlackTech prefers dynamic DNS services, with most of the domains’ registrars being
GoDaddy, paired with domaincontrol[.]com name servers (NS).
Domain naming conventions centered around technology/target (recent intrusion
reporting shows this pattern may change).

Background
BlackTech, a.k.a. Huapi, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, Radio Panda is a cyber espionage
actor routinely associated but never publicly attributed to Chinese security services. Primary
targets of the actor include the technology, financial and government sectors in Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Japan, and recently the U.S.
Please refer to the excellent reporting by JPCert, NTT, TrendMicro, and PWC’s
@cyberoverdrive and @malworms.

Infrastructure New & Old
The data captured in this post uses multiple vendor reports and VirusTotal and RiskIQ to
gather passive DNS data. One hundred thirty (130) domains linked to BlackTech were
identified and added to a CSV file along with first-seen dates, registrant and registrar
information, and name server information.

CSV files allow for identifying possible campaign time-lining and visualizing trends or
patterns in BlackTech infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Reusing
domains and overlapping infrastructure across different intrusion sets have become a calling
card for the actor(s).

Figure 2: Domains by year
The lone spike seen in Figure 1 in 2013 is in large part due to the “Four-Element Sword
Engagement.”
Constituting nearly a third of the domains registered, GoDaddy and domaincontrol[.]com NS
have provided defenders with clues to out related infrastructure before put in use.
As seen in the below scatter plot, PDR Ltd. and Vitalwerks Internet Solutions, LLC
represents the majority of registrars linked to BlackTech recently.
This activity consists of registrar changes in addition to name server information, as seen in
Figure 4.

Previously, defenders may have enjoyed success querying for tech-themed dynamic DNS
domains registered to GoDaddy with domaincontrol NS. While small wins in the above
hunting category may prove fruitful, updated infrastructure configurations should be
considered and watched closely.

Stepping back to look at the above data, three assumptions arise (I will leave the true
analysis to the experts):
The change in infrastructure is only temporary, and a return to normal patterns will
return.
The above behavior indicates a group that has had infrastructure burned by security
vendors and researchers on social media.
BlackTech campaigns call for different hosting configurations, explaining the change.
Unfortunately, when it comes to the inner workings of not only BlackTech but many APT
groups, few defenders have inside knowledge of day-to-day operations.
Only continued analysis with multiple colored Excel spreadsheets to track changes will inch
Blue Teamers closer to understanding one of the above assumptions.

Conclusion
While these configuration changes may not represent breaking news, identifying adversary
infrastructure before malicious activity ensues is very important for defenders.
Like puzzle pieces, registrant names and name servers alone may not provide a pretty
picture, but when paired with consistent naming themes and other registration information, a
clearer picture of an adversary emerges.
