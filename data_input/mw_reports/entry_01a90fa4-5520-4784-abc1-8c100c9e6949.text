Phishing Kit Kuzuluy Impersonating Paypal
In this Malware Analysis Spotlight, we will take a look at a phishing kit related to Kuzuluy,
also known as KuzuluyArt. According to Twitter user MaelSecurity, there was a Phishing-asa-Service associated with Kuzuluy impersonating PayPal in late 2019. At the time of our
research, the service is no longer available, but we found multiple variants of a Kuzuluy kit
targeting PayPal customers from Germany, Austria, and Slovakia.

Figure 1: Phishing page from Kuzuluy (left) and the legitimate PayPal login page
(right).
Figure 1. shows the phishing page (left) asking for PayPal credentials. Compared to the
legitimate online presence (right), we can see the phishing page uses a similar look and style
that can fool inattentive page visitors.

Figure 2: VMRay Analyzer – VTI matches of the phishing page.
Regardless of the similarity, the VMRay Platform successfully detects the phishing attempt of
the Kuzuluy kit. The VTI matches reveal it recognizes the page pretending to be the
legitimate PayPal login page based on heuristics (Figure 2). For example, the phishing page
uses the same title and contains a logon form.

Figure 3: Embedded JavaScript that process the credentials.
The JavaScript shown in Figure 3. is embedded into the page and validates the logon form
data by sending it to CheckLoginAndSend.php via POST-request. Depending on the result,
the page can redirect to Zweiter-Schritt.php, which then asks for further personal details and
credit card information.

Figure 4: Content of the script CheckLoginAndSend.php.
The script named CheckLoginAndSend.php sends the credentials via email and additionally
writes the data into a file on the server (Figure 4).
Like most kits, this one uses multiple stages in which it tries to protect itself against web bots
and to ensure the visitor is a potential victim. After all of these checks are passed, it redirects
to the phishing page as seen in Figure 1. By looking at the index page in the root folder, we
can see that the page includes nine scripts that are responsible for blocking bots and
common (analysis) tools. Each of these scripts works similarly. They compare some of the
visitor’s properties like his IP address or user-agent string against a blocklist. On a match,
the script stops the visitor from reaching the phishing page by sending a 404-page and
redirecting to “hxxp:://2m[.]ma”.

blocklist.

Figure 5. shows two examples of those tests. On the left, the kit resolves the host name of
the client and sends a 404-page if it contains one of the strings from the block list
“$f6650d6e”. Similar to the first test, the host name is compared again against another list
that includes AV vendors (Figure 5 right). Next, the script utilizes the third-party service
“hxxp://ipinfo.io” to test the client’s ISP. Note that the server is connecting to the service and
not the client.
After passing all of the tests, Kuzuluy generates a random id and makes a local copy of the
“art” directory to “/Reference/Ref-ID-<random id>”. Next, it redirects to the newly-created
copy which leads us to the previously seen phishing page in Figure 1. The copy-behavior
allows us to identify URLs referencing the phishing page of Kuzuluy.
A search for this string reveals the kit has been used in the wild since May. In addition, we
found multiple archives that are labeled as “cracked” or “leaked” associated with Kuzuluy.
Criminals sell their phishing kits online or provide a Phishing-as-a-Service that customers
can use to start their own phishing campaign.
Depending on the kit, the customer can configure and customize it to his own needs. Typical
examples are the language and delivery method of stolen credentials. More advanced kits
provide features to automatically setup servers and distribute spam emails. Criminals enrich
their kits with some kind of copy protection to protect their kits. A leaked or cracked version
of the kit claims to be a version without those protections.

Conclusion
In this Malware Analysis Spotlight, we have taken a look at a Kuzuluy phishing kit used in the
wild. We discussed how phishing kits can block certain (analysis) tools or ISPs, and
presented indicators to detect phishing attempts from the kit.
