ICS/SCADA Top 10 Most Dangerous
Software Weaknesses
by NJ OUCHN

This study is not affiliated with the MITRE Corporation even if the title has a
similarity in its formulation with the CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software
Errors1. In fact, it is my own initiative led in the context of statistics validation
regarding the vulnerability databases.

The followed methodology is quite diﬀerent from the MITRE since it is based on statistical data
extracted from vFeed2 the Vulnerability and threat Database. The MITRE methodology
leveraged the Common Weakness Scoring System 3 (CWSS) to categorize and assess the
weaknesses scores by over 20 contributing organizations.
Therefore, I have found it useful to focus on the vulnerabilities and weaknesses related to the
Industrial Systems as they are increasingly targeted by new sophisticated attacks.
According to the SANS security experts, during the previous RSA conference, the Industrial
System Controls attacks were listed amongst the top 6 emerging and trending new techniques.

The ICS/SCADA Top 10 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses list has been compiled on
the basis of the following assumptions :
1. The vulnerability database used in this research is vFeed (Database build 10032015). The latter
was developed with the main objective to collect and correlate a maximum of information
issued by third party vendors. The database accuracy and coverage were thoroughly
validated by the MITRE.
vFeed has been awarded with 3 certifications4 : Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE),
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Open Vulnerability Assessment Language
(OVAL) . A piece of code which relied on to collect and analyze the big amount of
information is provided in the Appendix.
2. The analyzed vulnerabilities are fundamentally associated with the manufacturers listed by
the ISC-CERT. This approach seemed to be rational since the ISC-CERT5 oﬃcially
coordinates the disclosure of security threats and vulnerabilities regarding the Industrial
Control Systems. The list of vendors is provided in the Appendix.
3. Numerous vulnerabilities are missing the CWE identifier. As a matter of fact the National
Vulnerability Database6 (NVD) only supports the CWEs listed here https://nvd.nist.gov/
cwe.cfm#cwes
Currently and in the context of this study, I have identified 147 CVEs related to 469 diﬀerent
products missing a CWE. However it was fairly simple to identify the missing adequate
CWE. Nevertheless,it is time consuming and not the purpose of this paper. I will later
communicate the list to NVD with a proposal of the missing CWEs.
4. Each CPE is treated as unique. Therefore, a vendor whose product containing several
vulnerable versions (CPEs) to the same CVE will be counted as many.
Ex: CVE-2012-4690 (CWE-16) hits 4 separate versions of the product Micrologix Controller
edited by Rockell Automation. Therefore, the CWE-16 is counted 4 times. Which is
perfectly logical in my opinion.
5. The most vulnerable products are the most known and widely used by the industries.
Therefore when a vendor wins a worldwide reputation, he must acknowledge it.

CWE-189

Numeric Errors

CWE-119

The software performs operations on a memory buﬀer, but it can read from or write to a
memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buﬀer.

CWE-20

When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form
that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving
unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or
arbitrary code execution

CWE-22

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or
directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not
properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to
resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

4 of 12

CWE-264

Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and
other security features that are used to perform access control.ry.

CWE-200

An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor
that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

CWE-255

Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of credentials.

CWE-287

When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insuﬃciently
proves that the claim is correct.

CWE-399

Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources.

CWE-79

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is
placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

CWE-189

Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers.
