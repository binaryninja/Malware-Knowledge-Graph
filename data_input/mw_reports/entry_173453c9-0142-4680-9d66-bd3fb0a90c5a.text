There is a very persistant fake mobile trading apps scam going on currently. This scam has
been building in popularity for some time. It is spreading to a wider global victim base than
before. A lot of money has been stolen from victims all over the world. In just Crypto scams
the 2021 figure was over $7billion , however this scam includes more traditional trading
plaforms as well.
We will give the full details in this article and information on how to spot these fraudsters.
There are a very large number of spoofed trading platforms involved in this scam. It
involves both main stream regulated platforms like the worlds largest financial exchanges
and reaches all the way down to very new crypto exchanges. The following report is
provided by The Silent Push Labs team.

This is a fake trading platform pretending to be the legitimate platform Epoch Financial

Outline
The Silent Push Labs team uncovered a threat actor launching several websites, Android
and iOS applications with counterfeit versions of trading platforms, targeting not only
regular stock based fintech companies but also cryptocurrency focused ones.
These meticulously designed fake platforms which mimic well known financial organizations
such as Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), AvaTrade, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles,
Coinbase, CoinSmart, eToro, Eurex, itBitTradingView, Nasdaq, Rakuten Wallet, Saxo Bank,
Timex Trading, among others, purposely lure unsuspecting victims into trusting their
services, only to steal their investments.
This group has scammed and stolen money from countless individuals worldwide.

Therefore, we have conducted a large investigation on this malicious actor, collecting
hundreds of Indicators of Compromise, as well as reports from victims which allowed us to
map their infrastructure and trace a profile on the course of their actions.

Threat actor profile and history
Although, we are unable to pin-point a date when this threat actor began its activity, we
found that several active items of this malicious infrastructure were deployed in early 2021.
Additionally, we had access to reports which described several occurrences with similar
characteristics to this group around that time period. Given that these victims were
located on Asian countries and that we found a small number of websites written in
Asian dialects, we are compelled to claim that this threat actor is located in Asia.
On the other hand and after analyzing their current infrastructure, we consider that
American and European organizations and users are currently at the most risk.

While navigating throughout this malicious infrastructure, an evident visual pattern
emerged amongst the websites we investigated. Despite having a particular name and logo,
the pages unfold in the same style: there is an initial website similar to the one displayed on
Image 5, which is used as an initial landing page to attract possible victims. From this
website, one can navigate to one of the following two pages:
- the app download page, similar to the one displayed on Image 1;
- or the website login page, where users can register and login into an account. We
believe that this is a web version alternative to the app, which allows the users to transact
funds and analyze fake stock indexes as can be seen on Image 3.
This fits into the Crime-as-a-service model with the fraudulent platform being distributed by
different affiliate providers.

Victims' reports
We found many complaints concerning this malicious agent surfacing on the internet.
As suspected, the majority of them were written by scammed individuals but also by
people who wish to take down this organization.
Initial interactions with the threat actors vary due to a possible affiliate scheme. We have
seen varying reports from Romance Scams (hence Sophos referring to this as Cryptorom)
to Forum recommendations. Whatever the initial introduction and resulting
conversation the victim eventually puts money into the fake account. Unfortunately,
once the victim tries to withdrawal the money, they see themselves logged out of their
account and unable to log in, while the threat actors keep their funds and plan the next
target.
We found similar messages on various websites as well as announcements from some
fintechs reporting this robbery scheme.

Installation process.
The primary target is mobile devices. The threat actors encourage users to download
a mobile app or use a “Webapp”. There are download links for iOS, and Android.
Analyzing the way the application is distributed on iOS equipment, it appears that the
attackers exploit two main ways to get around the Apple approvals process:
1. The first one is done by simply creating a Configuration profile, which is a
.mobileconfig file that can be easily shared.
2. The second one is through Testflight, a tool created by Apple, that allows developers
to test their applications and provide Beta versions of new apps without facing the
severe verification protocols found on Apple Store.
This can allow public direct link downloads to up to 10000 accounts.

On the other hand, when it comes to Android users, an .apk file with a tailored name
matching the specific website gets downloaded. If at first glance this file appears to be
authentic, a more careful look reveals some obfuscated information using a combination
of a tool called String Fog, base 64 and a XOR operation to encrypt suspicious data.
However, our team was able to decrypt some of this information, namely a few servers and
config URLs.

There are some claims online that mention the existence of malware (Trojan) on the
apps. Unfortunately, we can not assuredly deny or confirm this information, at the time of
the publication of this blog post.

Final remarks
Taking everything into account, we are confident that this threat actor will continue to
develop and distribute trading platforms, in order to exploit and steal funds from individuals.
The methods of delivery will vary as expected with an affiliate program.
We recommend blocking access to the uderlying app download infrastructure.

7/14

With that in mind, we have collected an extensive list of Indicators of Compromise, which
are available for the Silent Push costumers. Additionally, these users have access to prebuilt modifiable queries that allow them to navigate through this operating
infrastructure, as well as access to whois information, server information, curated risk
scores and other innovative functionality.
