On May 29th, we identified an attack that we believe is part of a new campaign from an
Advanced Persistent Threat actor known as Higaisa. The Higaisa APT is believed to be tied
to the Korean peninsula, and was first disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence
Center in early 2019.
The group’s activities go back to at least 2016 and include the use of Trojans such as Gh0st
and PlugX, as well as mobile malware. Its targets include government officials and human
rights organizations, as well as other entities related to North Korea.
In this latest incident, Higaisa used a malicious shortcut file ultimately responsible for
creating a multi-stage attack that consists of several malicious scripts, payloads and decoy
PDF documents.

Distribution
The threat actors used a malicious LNK file bundled within an archive file which was most
likely distributed via spear-phishing.
We were able to identify two variants of this campaign that possibly have been distributed
between May 12th and 31st:

1/11

“CV_Colliers.rar”
“Project link and New copyright policy.rar”
Both RAR archives bundle two malicious LNK files. In the newer variant (CV_Colliers.rar),
the LNK files are disguised as a Curriculum Vitae (CV) and International English Language
Testing System (IELTS) exam results. The older one (Project link and New copyright
policy.rar) seems to target product teams that are using zeplin.io.
The following shows the overall process flow when executing the malicious LNK file.

Figure 1: Process graph

LNK file
The LNK file contains a list of commands that will be executed upon running, and a blob that
is a base64 encoded compressed payload. Here is the list of commands that will be
executed:

Figure 2: Malicious lnk commands
Copy content of the LNK file into “g4ZokyumB2DC4.tmp” in %APPDATA% temp
directory.
Copy content of “certutil.exe” into “gosia.exe” ( “*ertu*.exe is used to bypass security
detection).
Look for the base64 blob using “findstr.exe” and write it to “cSi1rouy4.tmp”.

2/11

Decode content of “cSi1rouy4.tmp” using “gosia.exe -decode” (certutil.exe -decode)
and write it to “o423DFDS4.tmp”.
Decompress content of “o423DFDS4.tmp” in temp directory along with a decoy PDF
document using “expand.exe -F:*” (Figure 3) .
Copy “66DF3DFG.tmp” and “34fDKfSD38.js” files into “C:\Users\Public\Downloads”
directory.
Execute the JS file by calling Wscript.
Open the decoy document.

The list of commands executed by this LNK shortcut is the same as the one reported by
Anomali on the Higasia Covid-19 campaign. The only difference is the name of the tmp files
and name of certutil.exe which in this new case is “gosia.exe”, while in the March campaign
the name was “mosia.exe”.
Both LNK files embedded within the archive are executing similar commands with the
different Command and Control (C&C) configurations. Running each of them would show a
different decoy document.

JS file
The JavaScript file performs the following commands:
Create “d3reEW.exe” in “C:\Users\Public\Downloads” and store “cmd /c ipconfig” in it.
Execute the dropped “svchast.exe”.
Copy “svchhast.exe” into startup directory and rename it as “officeupdate.exe”.

4/11

Add “officeupdate.exe” to scheduled tasks.
Send a POST request to a hardcoded URL with “d3reEW.exe” as data.

svchast.exe
Svchast.exe is a small loader that loads the content of the shellcode stored in
“66DF3DFG.tmp”.

Figure 8: Main function of svchast.exe
In fact, this shellcode is a wrapper around the final shellcode. It performs some checks and
then calls the final shellcode.

Figure 9: Calling

final shellcode
The final shellcode dynamically resolves the imports and allocates memory for the content
that will be executed.

Figure 11: Allocate memory for new thread
Finally it calls “CreateThread” to create a thread within its memory space to make HTTPS
requests to its C&C server.

Figure 11: CreateThread
At the time of analysis, the server was down so we weren’t able to clearly identify the
ultimate goal of this attack.

Chaining techniques for evasion
While most malware campaigns use a simple decoy document that typically retrieves a
malware payload, more advanced attackers will often try unconventional means to infect
their victims.
We reproduced this attack in our lab using an email as the infection vector, as we surmise
that victims were spear-phished. Malwarebytes (in this case the Nebula business version)
stopped the LNK file execution from WinRAR and therefore completely stopped the attack.
