The (probably) penultimate post in our occasional series demystifying Latin American banking trojans.
Before concluding our series, there is one more LATAM banking trojan that deserves a closer look –
Numando. The threat actor behind this malware family has been active since at least 2018. Even though it is
not nearly as lively as Mekotio or Grandoreiro, it has been consistently used since we started tracking it,
bringing interesting new techniques to the pool of Latin American banking trojans’ tricks, like using seemingly
useless ZIP archives or bundling payloads with decoy BMP images. Geographically, it focuses almost
exclusively on Brazil with rare campaigns in Mexico and Spain.

Characteristics

1/8

As with all the other Latin American banking trojans described in this series, Numando is written in Delphi
and utilizes fake overlay windows to lure sensitive information out of its victims. Some Numando variants
store these images in an encrypted ZIP archive inside their .rsrc sections, while others utilize a separate
Delphi DLL just for this storage.
Backdoor capabilities allow Numando to simulate mouse and keyboard actions, restart and shutdown the
machine, display overlay windows, take screenshots and kill browser processes. Unlike other Latin American
banking trojans, however, the commands are defined as numbers rather than strings (see Figure 1), which
inspired our naming of this malware family.

Strings are encrypted by the most common algorithm among Latin American banking trojans (shown in
Figure 5 of our Casbaneiro write-up) and are not organized into a string table. Numando collects the
victimized machine’s Windows version and bitness.
Unlike most of the other Latin American banking trojans covered in this series, Numando does not show
signs of continuous development. There are some minor changes from time to time, but overall the binaries
do not tend to change much.

Distribution and execution
Numando is distributed almost exclusively by spam. Based on our telemetry, its campaigns affect several
hundred victims at most, making it considerably less successful than the most prevalent LATAM banking
trojans such as Mekotio and Grandoreiro. Recent campaigns simply add a ZIP attachment containing an
MSI installer to each spammed message. This installer contains a CAB archive with a legitimate application,
an injector, and an encrypted Numando banking trojan DLL. If the potential victim executes the MSI, it
eventually runs the legitimate application as well, and that side-loads the injector. The injector locates the
payload and then decrypts it using a simple XOR algorithm with a multi-byte key, as in the overview of this
process illustrated in Figure 2.

For Numando, the payload and injector are usually named identically – the injector with the .dll extension
and the payload with no extension (see Figure 3) – making it is easy for the injector to locate the encrypted
payload. Surprisingly, the injector is not written in Delphi – something very rare among Latin American
banking trojans. The IoCs at the end of this blogpost contain a list of legitimate applications we have
observed Numando abuse.

payload (Oleacc) and legitimate DLLs.

Decoy ZIP and BMP overlay
There is one interesting distribution chain from the recent past worth mentioning. This chain starts with a
Delphi downloader downloading a decoy ZIP archive (see Figure 4). The downloader ignores the archive’s
contents and extracts a hex-encoded encrypted string from the ZIP file comment, an optional ZIP file
component stored at the end of the file. The downloader does not parse the ZIP structure, but rather looks
for the last { character (used as a marker) in the whole file. Decrypting the string results in a different URL
that leads to the actual payload archive.

comment at the end of the archive (red)

The second ZIP archive contains a legitimate application, an injector and a suspiciously large BMP image.
The downloader extracts the contents of this archive and executes the legitimate application, which sideloads the injector that, in turn, extracts the Numando banking trojan from the BMP overlay and executes it.
The process is illustrated in Figure 5.

This BMP file is a valid image and can be opened in a majority of image viewers and editors without issue,
as the overlaly is simply ignored. Figure 6 shows some of the decoy images the Numando threat actor uses.

Remote configuration
Like many other Latin American banking trojans, Numando abuses public services to store its remote
configuration – YouTube and Pastebin in this case. Figure 7 shows an example of the configuration stored
on YouTube – a technique similar to Casbaneiro, though much less sneaky. Google took the videos down
promptly based on ESET’s notification.

Figure 7. Numando remote configuration on YouTube

The format is simple – three entries delimited by “:” between the DATA:{ and } markers. Each entry is
encrypted separately the same way as other strings in Numando – with the key hardcoded in the binary. This
makes it difficult to decrypt the configuration without having the corresponding binary, however Numando
does not change its decryption key very often, making decryption possible.

Conclusion

5/8

Numando is a Latin American banking trojan written in Delphi. It targets mainly Brazil with rare campaigns in
Mexico and Spain. It is similar to the other families described in our series – it uses fake overlay windows,
contains backdoor functionality and utilizes MSI.
We have covered its most typical features, distribution methods and remote configuration. It is the only
LATAM banking trojan written in Delphi that uses a non-Delphi injector and its remote configuration format is
unique, making two reliable factors when identifying this malware family.
