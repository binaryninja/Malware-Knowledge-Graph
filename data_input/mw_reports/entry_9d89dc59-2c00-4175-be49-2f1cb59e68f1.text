Russia is fully capable of shutting down cybercrime

It is no secret the locus for a great deal of the world’s cybercriminal activity lays within the
boundaries of The Russian Federation. The onslaught of ransomware attacks directed at
non-Russian entities is evidence of that.
Last week, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group published a report shedding more light on the
connection between the Russian state and criminal actors, a connection that Insikt Group
posits is “well established yet highly diffused.”
The key judgments from the Insikt Groups analysis are:
It is highly likely that Russian intelligence services and law enforcement have a
longstanding, tacit understanding with criminal threat actors.
This association will continue, though efforts to put space between the government and
criminal entities may increase to provide greater plausible deniability to the government
US President Joe Biden’s assertion that Russian cybercriminals are protected by the
Russian government has placed Russian President Vladimir Putin on the defensive.

Russian cybercriminals are reforming their operations and targeting vectors implying
that the Biden administration’s actions have been modestly successful.
Is this much of a surprise to those who invest their professional life watching things Russia?
Not really, says Monique Camarra, co-host of the Kremlin File who explains, “We know the
KGB was present in all aspects of Soviet life, so it’s no surprise that they would have
relations and dealings with criminal groups. Important hubs were controlled by the KGB in
cooperation with criminal elements.” She continued how, for example, “the Tambov crime
group, during privatization of state assets, regained control of the port, fuel and energy
business. The fact that the new cadre of criminals, the cybercriminals, are attached at the hip
to the Russian security apparatus should surprise no one.”

US sanctions have consequences
As a result of a flurry of ransomware attacks that impacted the United States infrastructure,
the United States hit Russia in April 2021 with both sanctions and the expulsion of
diplomatic/intelligence personnel from the United States, tying the diplomatic actions to the
criminal actions in a clear and unambiguous signal: the tolerance of the United States was
approaching its end point.
In June, at the summit referenced in Insikt Group’s analysis and then again in July 2021
when Biden held a telephone conference call with Putin, a similar message was delivered,
unambiguously, by Biden. Biden commented to reporters, "I made it very clear to him that the
United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil even though it's
not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act
on who that is."
It isn’t as if Russia can’t control their internet gateways across which these cyber crimes are
being committed. To wit: On September 2, 2021, with the Russian election fast approaching
and the efforts of Putin to silence dissent in overdrive, Roskomnadzor blocked six providers
of virtual private networks to the Russian market (Hola! VPN, ExpressVPN, KeepSolid VPN
Unlimited, Nord VPN, Speedify VPN, IPVanish VPN); the organization had previously
excluded two others, VyprVPN and OperaVPN. Roskomnadzor claims they blocked the VPN
services due to “illegal activities, including those related to the distribution of drugs, child
pornography, extremism and suicidal tendencies.”

Dmitry Dokuchaev—a key individual
Interestingly, the Insikt analysis draws on actions that occurred over the last decade to create
their mosaic of interconnectivity between the Russian government and cybercriminals. The
analysis hangs its hat on Dmitry Dokuchaev, among others, a major in the Russian interior
ministry (FSB), who is a unique individual in that he was simultaneously under indictment by
the United States for cybercrimes and by Russia for treason associated with cybercrimes
while an officer of the FSB in 2016. He pleaded guilty in Russia and went to prison.

The circumstances of Dokuchaev’s arrest further cement the connection between the
Russian government and the criminal cyber world and illustrate what Russia is capable of
doing to cybercriminals if it is in their interests.
The FSB cyber operations group, Information Security Center, of which Dokuchaev was a
member, imploded in December 2016 through January 2017, with the arrests of multiple
leadership personnel.
The initial arrests included Colonel Sergey Mikhailov, deputy director of the center, and
Ruslan Stoyanov, a manager at Kaspersky Labs. They are alleged to have feathered their
nest by sharing with the West (the FBI and others) data that had been harvested from
Russian companies which they engaged to investigate… wait for it… cybercrimes.
The arrest of Mikhailov was full of drama and seemed straight out of a 1950s Russian crime
film: He reportedly was present at an FSB staff meeting when he was dragged
unceremoniously out the of the building with a bag over his head. The next arrests included
Dokuchaev, who served as Mikhailov’s deputy within the center, and the director of the
center, Andrei Gerasimov. In 2019, Mikhailov was sentenced to 22 years in prison by the
Russian courts.
Much to the chagrin of the FSB, their dirty laundry was being aired for all to see, as the
internal catfight between the FSB’s Information Security Center, which just had its leadership
arrested for cybercrimes, and the FSB’s Special Communications Group (previously known
to western intelligence as FAPSI, the group in charge of Russian cryptographic standards,
security of Russian elections, signals intelligence, and a multitude of other activities)
culminated in the Special Communications Group assimilating the Information Security
Center.

Russia’s action to take
The FSB saga is evidence that Russia is fully capable of arresting and prosecuting cyber
criminals operating within their geographic and virtual internet footprint. The bar is high for
instances of cybercrime that will cause the Russian government to take action. But clearly,
two officers facilitating the West’s investigation into Russian cybercriminals off the record and
allegedly for millions of dollars, met that bar.
The choice of words is always important and therefore one reading between the lines will
note the subtlety of Biden’s messaging to Putin: It is in the Russian Federation’s interest to
act because, regardless of whether entities operate with or without the tacit
acknowledgement of the Russian government, the United States had provided fair warning
that lack of action by Russia will result in the United States acting in its own interest.

Time will tell if the relationship between Russian cybercriminals and the Russian Federation
cyber entities will evolve in a manner that quiets the former and their criminal activities. If not,
the potential for action by U.S. government entities should be expected.
