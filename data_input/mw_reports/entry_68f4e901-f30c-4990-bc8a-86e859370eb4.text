2020 Global IoT/ICS Risk Report

Detailed in the CyberX Global 2020 IoT/ICS Risk Report, this
analysis of real-world vulnerabilities from IoT/ICS network
threats and unmanaged devices remains the only one of its kind.

NOT MINDING THE GAP: DIRECT INTERNET CONNECTIONS

27%

Gaining visibility into IoT/ICS risk and mitigating these "hidden" vulnerabilities is critical to
protecting organizations from costly production downtime, safety and environmental incidents,
and theft of sensitive intellectual property.
Spanning diverse IoT/ICS systems — including robotics, refrigeration, chemical and
pharmaceutical production, power generation and distribution, oil production,and building
management systems (HVAC, CCTV, etc.) — the 2020 report is based on network data collected
globally during the 12-month period spanning October 2018 to October 2019.

of sites analyzed have direct
connections to the internet

Security professionals and bad actors alike know that it takes only one internet-connected device to provide
a gateway into IoT/ICS networks for malware and targeted attacks, enabling the subsequent compromise of
many more systems across the enterprise.

STALE SIGNATURES: NO AUTOMATIC AV UPDATES

66%

of sites are not automatically updating their Windows
systems with the latest antivirus definitions

Antivirus is the very first layer of defense against known malware — and the lack of antivirus is one reason why
CyberX still finds older malware such as WannaCry and Conficker in IoT/ICS networks.

BROKEN WINDOWS: OUTDATED OPERATING SYSTEMS

62%

of sites have outdated and unsupported Microsoft Windows
boxes such as Windows XP and Windows 2000

Unsupported Windows boxes no longer receive regular security patches from Microsoft. The figure jumps to 71%
if we include Windows 7, which reaches end-of-support status in January 2020.

HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT: UNENCRYPTED PASSWORDS

64%

Median Security Score Across All Industries: 69

We recommend a minimum score of 80 to our clients. The scores across industries remained
mostly consistent with our findings last year, with regulated industries such as energy utilities
maintaining a slightly higher score than other industries.

of sites have unencrypted (cleartext)
passwords traversing their networks

74

The reason cleartext is dangerous is because it makes gaining access to restricted systems easy — since these
passwords are transmitted “in the clear” and can easily be sniffed. Legacy devices that don’t support modern
protocols such as SNMP v3 or SFTP are usually the culprits for leaving passwords in cleartext.

Oil & Gas

62

EXCESSIVE ACCESS: REMOTELY ACCESSIBLE DEVICES

54%

Pharmaceuticals
& Chemicals

of sites have devices that can be remotely accessed
using standard protocols such as RDP, SSH, and VN

One of the primary attack vectors for ransomware is remote access protocols, which enable attackers to move
laterally and expand their presence throughout networks.

70

Energy & Utilities

63

Manufacturing

Other

“Other” includes transportation, mining, data centers, and universities.
