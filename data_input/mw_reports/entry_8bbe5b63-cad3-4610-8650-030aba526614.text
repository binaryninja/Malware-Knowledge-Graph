Operation DustySky Notes
Earlier this morning, Eyal from Clearsky Cyber Security publisheda paper on "Operation
DustySky", a set of targeted campaigns attributed back to the Gaza Cybergang. When
working with Clearsky, we observed some interesting details and overlap that didn't quite
ﬁt in the paper, so we wanted to publish them here.

72.11.148.147
We found this IP address to be interesting due to the SSL certiﬁcate, mix of dynamic DNS
and registered domains and recent activity.

Based on the heatmap above, a user can easily identify that trafﬁc to this particular IP is
fairly new (showing in mid-December). What’s worth noting is that the ﬁrst day starts with
just one resolution, followed by 17 and then 24. Those ﬁrst 3 days appears to be
signiﬁcant as newly observed domains (notated by the orange ﬂag) are seen and then it’s
nothing new over the next few weeks.

The certiﬁcate for this domain is interesting, but does not appear to lead to any new
discoveries. Clicking on “Serial Number”, “Common Name” and “SHA-1” do not reveal
anymore new IP discoveries or overlap.

192.161.48.59
This IP address is interesting because of the SSL certiﬁcates, but mainly due to some
overlap with Gaza Cybergang and a strange pattern in the domain changes.

In this heatmap, you can see a clear change from Dynamic/Registered infrastructure to
just dynamic infrastructure in the past ~2.5 weeks. While this may not be signiﬁcant, it’s
worth noting and should be investigated or compared to attack times. Did attackers stop
on the same day they switched to dynamic DNS only? Was this infrastructure used
again?

Above is a screenshot of the results table from update.ciscofreak.com which used the
192.161.48.59 address back in April of this year. It’s worth noting that based on the
PassiveTotal OSINT tags, you can see that Kaspersky had reported on the Gaza
Cybergang for the IP address 172.227.95.162 which resolved at the same time. While
time periods may not overlap completely (was 192.161.48.59 used for malicious purposes
in April?), it’s still worth investigating.

172.227.95.162
This IP address was reported by Kaspersky as being linked to Gaza Cybergang and
shows overlap to the DustySky infrastructure in April of this year. Looking at the results,
it’s interesting that it seems to show a similar pattern of dynamic/registered domains and
then a sudden shift to dynamic DNS only.

The results seem to show more potential links to malicious activity with dynamic DNS
domains not mentioned in reporting being shown. Due to the dynamic DNS nature,
there’s a good chance these are not related or may no longer be malicious, but they still
have recent activity that could be used as a research point.

Also, worth showing that there’s an SSL certiﬁcate associated with the IP address from
October of last year. It’s a wildcard certiﬁcate that shows a relation to Quantas Airways

Limited giving us a timeframe that the current holders appear to be non-malicious and that
started around October. Anything before that period could be suspect. Also, it’s strange
that those Dynamic DNS domains continue to point to the IP despite being owned by a
real service. Did the attackers abandon their infrastructure?

45.32.13.169
This IP address shows a connection to the following SSL certiﬁcate starting in October of
2015.

While not incredibly unique, the common name of the certiﬁcate is interesting. Looking for
open source data doesn’t reveal any connections to malware, but the domain itself is
strange and a good point to pivot off of.

Clicking the subject name reveals quite a lot of other IP addresses that used a certiﬁcate
with the same name roughly around the same 6 month time period in 2015. Many of
these appear to be dead-ends, but 131.72.136.124 shows some domains associated with
it that have OSINT hits associating back to PWC reporting on Middle Eastern actors using
xtremeRAT and Poison Ivy and Kaspersky Gaza Cybergang.

The above results for 131.72.136.124 show yet again, an interesting change of dynamic
and registered domains and then going to dynamic only in the past few weeks. Unlikely a
correlation, but interesting nonetheless. The OSINT data is clearly seen by the tags on
within the result table.

Co.vu
It’s valuable to dig into the co.vu usage a bit more for these actors. Going to the services
website reveals a dynamic-like service in which users can obfuscate their Tumblr or
Blogger blog using a co.vu address.

Registering for free gives users 3 free domains they can use. Given these co.vu
addresses are being used in attacks, it’s worth identifying the importance of the domains.
Are they being used for command and control or phishing landing pages or exploit
delivery? The obfuscation on top of an already 3rd-party service shows signs that
attackers are looking to hide their tracks or complicate analysis.
