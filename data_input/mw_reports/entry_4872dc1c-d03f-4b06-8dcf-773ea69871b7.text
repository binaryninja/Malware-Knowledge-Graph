Preface:
A director at Google once told me that the larger an organization, the less subtlety is possible
in what it says publicly, and even the most carefully postulated assessment, cushioned with
supporting analytic language, will be interpreted as fact.
Naming of threat actor groups and malware is a critical aspect to tracking cyber operations.
Armchair Researchers, more concerned with social media follower counts, often decry these
names as marketing hooks, whereas they are actually complex shibboleths that convey the
scope of a set of activity and its sourcing.
Since roughly 2016, the United States government has been actively working to collaborate
with non-government agencies. The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have all
begun publicly sharing tactical reporting containing technical details, indicators, and
defensive recommendations. These reports have become a staple of any major cyber
incident because they provide an authoritative situational overview and an initial starting
point for collaboration.
In recent reports[1][2], attribution has been presented at the forefront of the report and used
industry cryptonyms along with military units or specific government entities. While this may
be intended to support broader usage (outside of technical consumers), attribution in these
reports, without supporting analysis, is creating a dangerous precedent.
Technical analysis is fundamentally rooted in scientific methodology. When research is
presented, a basic requirement is that it is sufficiently detailed to be validated by reproducing
the analysis. Within the aforenoted reports, attribution is presented as a statement of fact,
similar in confidence to the reported dates or software versions, instead of as a confidencestructured assessment.
It may be possible the authors of these reports have a Palant√≠r[3], allowing them to perfectly
identify the hostile authors, but without proper confidence language and presentation, these
assessments are just as likely to have been made by a roll of the dice.
In future reports, providing context regarding how reported activity links to named sets will
provide critical information to existing understanding of these groups. In instances where
providing this information may risk sources and methods, limiting assessed attribution to a
1/2

broad geographic estimate or omitting it entirely may provide a better service.
