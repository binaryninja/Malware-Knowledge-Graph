Please do not upload to virustotal !
To prevent RATel from being detected by antivirus, please do not upload the payload to
TOTAL VIRUS.
Each month I will test myself if the payload gets detected by antivirus.
So youâ€™ll have a photo every month to prove RAtel discretion.

Description
RAT-el is an open source penetration test tool that allows you to take control of a windows
machine.
It works on the client-server model, the server sends commands and the client executes the
commands and sends the result back to the server.
The client is completely undetectable by anti-virus software.
