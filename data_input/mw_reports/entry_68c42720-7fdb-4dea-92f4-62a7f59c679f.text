Ransomware

April 6, 2022

Lockbit Ransomware gang, also known as Bitwise Spider, are the cybercriminal masterminds
behind the popular Lockbit Ransomware-as-a-service. They are one of the most active
ransomware gangs with generally multiple victims per day, sometimes higher. On March 16,
2022, they began continuously announcing new victims on their Dark Web site much faster
than any ransomware group. SOCRadar has detected more than 22 victims in 48 hours.

Origins of the Lockbit Ransomware
They have begun their operations in September 2019 as ABCD ransomware and then
changed its name to Lockbit. They have rebranded and came back with even better
ransomware on June 2021, as Lockbit 2.0. We have seen that the Lockbit 2.0 ransomware
introduced new features such as shadow copy and log file deletion to make recovery
harder for the victims. In addition, Lockbit has the fastest encryption speed among the most
popular ransomware gangs, with around 25 thousand files encrypted in under one minute.
The gang is believed to be originated in Russia. According to a detailed analysis of Lockbit
2.0, the ransomware checks the default system language and avoids encryption, and stops
the attack if the victim system’s language is Russian or the language of one of the nearby
1/6

countries.

Lockbit on Russia – Ukraine Cyberwar
In the cyber crisis between Russia and Ukraine, which began on February 23rd, 2022,
Lockbit announced that it would not participate in the cyberattacks. They announced that
they would not take part in cyberattacks on international conflicts. They are only in it for the
business and do not care about politics. Another very active ransomware gang also believed
to be from Russia, Conti, had stated that they would be siding with Russia, which some
members of Conti were not pleased with. Following the events, some insider members of
Conti began leaking internal chat logs and source code for the Conti locker and decryptor.
You can read more about the Conti Leaks in our blog post.

Lockbit’s announcement on the Russia-Ukraine Cyberwar
A funny detail about the gang is that they are confident in their skills and arrogant. On March
25, 2022, a member of Lockbit has announced on a hacker forum that they’ll be giving a
million dollars to an FBI agent who can doxx them, placing a million-dollar bounty on its own
head.

Dark Web Gossips: Lockbit 3.0 Emerging
FBI’s cyber division published an FBI Flash security advisory on Lockbit 2.0’s Indicators of
Compromise (IOCs) on March 4th, 2022. After the FBI’s advisory, a user in a Dark Web
forum has posted a forum entry with the title “Kockbit fuckup thread.” In the post, the user
addresses the bugs found in Lockbit 2.0 ransomware and a recovery method for the victims,
addressing the FBI’s advisory along with Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team’s
(DART’s) research on Lockbit. Below, you can find the links for Microsoft DART’s research.
Microsoft DART researchers have discovered a method by uncovering and exploiting bugs
found in the Lockbit 2.0 ransomware, enabling them to successfully revert the encryption
process on an MSSQL database of one of Lockbit’s victims.

Dark web forum post on Lockbit bugs and a recovery method
A member of the Lockbit ransomware group has commented on the post explaining the
reason for the MSSQL bug. The Lockbit member says the bug will not exist in Lockbit 3.0,
signaling the newest version’s release.

Lockbit member’s comment on the post
After a couple of days, on March 17, the cyber research team vx-underground has posted a
screenshot of their talks with one of Lockbit’s associates. On the screenshot, the vxunderground researcher asks when Lockbit 3.0 is being released, and the Lockbit affiliate
says the newest version will be released in one or two weeks.

The Lockbit group is still using the Lockbit 2.0 name, but we can expect an update in the
following month. It has been two weeks since vx-underground tweeted their conversation
with the Lockbit affiliate, but the Lockbit team has no deadline to uphold. They can release
the new version whenever they want.
The new features and upgrades in Lockbit 3.0 is still a mystery. SOCRadar CTIA team will
follow the updates regarding Lockbit 3.0 and bring you the latest updates.,
