Driven by the temptation of big ransom payments, a new ransomware called PwndLocker
has started targeting the networks of businesses and local governments with ransom
demands over $650,000.
This new ransomware began operating in late 2019 and has since encrypted a stream of
victims ranging from local cities to organizations.
BleepingComputer has been told that the ransom amounts being demanded by
PwndLocker range from $175,000 to over $660,000 depending on the size of the network.
It is not known if any of these victims have paid at this time.

PwndLocker says they encrypted Lasalle County's network
A source recently told BleepingComputer that the ransomware attack against Lasalle
County in Illinois was conducted by the operators of the PwndLocker Ransomware.

When asked by BleepingComputer, the ransomware operators said they are behind the
attack and are demanding a 50 bitcoin ransom ($442,000) for a decryptor.
The attackers have also told BleepingComputer that they have stolen data from the county
before encrypting the network. From an image and a list of folders shared with
BleepingComputer by the attackers, it does look like files were stolen from the county.
Local media reports that Lasalle County has no plans on paying the ransom.
BleepingComputer has contacted Lasalle County via email for confirmation but the emails
were rejected. We have also left a voicemail but have not heard back at this time.
Update 3/3/2020 8:19 AM: PwndLocker has also encrypted the network for the City of Novi
Sad in Serbia.
Update 3/3/2020 7:18 PM: PwndLocker shared an image and a list of folders that they say
were stolen from Lasalle County.

The PwndLocker Ransomware
In a sample shared with BleepingComputer by MalwareHunterTeam, when
executed PwndLocker will attempt to disable a variety of Windows services using the 'net
stop' command so that their data can be encrypted.
Some of the applications whose services are targeted include Veeam, Microsoft SQL
Server, MySQL, Exchange, Acronis, Zoolz, Backup Exec, Oracle, Internet Information
Server (IIS), and security software such as Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, Sophos, and McAfee.
The ransomware will also target various processes and terminate them if detected. Some of
the processes targeted include Firefox, Word, Excel, Access, and other processes related
to security software, backup applications, and database servers.
PwndLocker will now clear the Shadow Volume Copies so that they cannot be used to
recover files with the following commands:
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
vssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=D: /on=D: /maxsize=401MB
vssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=D: /on=D: /maxsize=unbounded

Once the system has been prepped for encryption, PwndLocker will begin to encrypt the
computer.
While encrypting files, it will skip any files that contain one of the following extensions.
.exe, .dll, .lnk, .ico, .ini, .msi, .chm, .sys, .hlf, .lng, .inf, .ttf, .cmd, .bat,
.vhd, .bac, .bak, .wbc, .bkf, .set, .win, .dsk

The ransomware will also skip all files located in the following folders:

When encrypting files, MalwareHunterTeam has seen it using the .key and .pwnd
extensions depending on the victim. The sample BleepingComputer analyzed uses the .key
extension as shown below.

Files encrypted by PwndLocker
When done encrypting, ransom notes named H0w_T0_Rec0very_Files.txt will be located
throughout the computer and on the Windows desktop.
These ransom notes will contain an email address and Tor payment site that can be used to
get payment instructions and the ransom amount.

The PwndLocker Payment Site allows victims to decrypt two files for free, talk to the
ransomware operators and contains the ransom amount in bitcoins.

It is not known at this time if there are any weaknesses in the encryption algorithm.
