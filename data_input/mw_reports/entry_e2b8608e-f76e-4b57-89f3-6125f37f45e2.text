The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered the distribution of AppleSeed disguised as
purchase orders and request forms. AppleSeed is a backdoor malware mainly used by the
Kimsuky group. It stays in the system and performs malicious behaviors by receiving
commands from attackers.

The malware is currently being distributed under the following filenames.
Purchase order-**-2022****-001-National Tax Service additionally implementing
security sensors in 5 regional tax offices_***.jse
Request form(general manager ***).jse
The JSE (JScript Encoded File) file consists of JavaScript, and when it is run, it drops
AppleSeed backdoor file (DLL file) and the purchase order PDF file that acts as bait in the
%ProgramData% path. After then, PDF file is automatically run (see Figure 2).

The file uses regsvr32.exe to decode and run the backdoor file (area shaded with purple)
and mshta.exe to download and run additional scripts (area shaded with red).

When the scripts are run, the following information is stolen and sent to the C2.
Basic information of the PC (PC name, OS version, processor, and memory)
User account credentials
Network information (IP address, routing table, port usage information, and ARP list)
List of running processes and services
Folders and files within ProgramFiles / Programs within the Start menu / List of recent
files

Figure 4. Information stolen using additionally downloaded scripts
The AppleSeed backdoor file continuously receives commands from the C2 server to
download and run additional modules, or perform behaviors that the attacker wishes to
perform. For a detailed analysis of AppleSeed, refer to the following link.
The figure below shows the overall process tree after the scripts are run.

Because the bait file is also run, users normally cannot recognize that their systems are
infected by malware. As the files mentioned above mainly target certain companies, users
should refrain from running attachments in emails sent from unknown sources.
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, is currently detecting and blocking the files using the
following aliases.
