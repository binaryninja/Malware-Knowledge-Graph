Apostolos Trovias, a/k/a “The Bull,” Used the Dark Web and
Encrypted Messaging Services to Solicit, Offer, and Sell Inside
Information
Audrey Strauss, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and
William F. Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), announced today the unsealing of a criminal
indictment and a criminal complaint charging APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “The Bull,” with
securities fraud and money laundering in connection with his scheme to solicit and sell stock
trading tips and pre-release earnings and deal information regarding public companies.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “Today’s charges demonstrate our Office’s
continuing commitment to stopping those who pursue and use inside information to gain an
illegal edge in the stock market. As alleged, Apostolos Trovias attempted to hide his insider

trading scheme behind anonymizing software, screennames, and bitcoin payments. The
Indictment and Complaint unsealed today show that committing insider trading using new
technologies still produces a decidedly traditional outcome: a criminal indictment.”
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: “Behind the veil of the Dark Web, using
encrypted messaging applications and emails, Trovias created a business model in which he
sold—for profit—proprietary information from other companies, stock trading tips, pre-release
earnings, and other inside information, as we allege. The FBI operates within the Dark Web
too, and as Trovias learned today, we don't stop enforcing the law just because you commit
federal crimes from behind a router with your keyboard.”
According to the allegations in the Indictment and Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan
federal court:[1]
Since at least in or about December 2016, APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, who identifies himself by
the pseudonym “The Bull,” has used websites on the Dark Web and encrypted messaging
services to solicit and sell confidential, non-public information about publicly traded
companies (“Inside Information”) to enrich himself. TROVIAS’s scheme consisted of multiple
related efforts to obtain and monetize confidential nonpublic business information, including
(1) the sale of misappropriated stock tips based on confidential customer trading information;
(2) the sale of pre-release earnings reports and deal information misappropriated from
publicly-traded companies; and (3) the attempted creation of an online marketplace to
connect, for a commission, individuals misappropriating Inside Information to individuals
willing to pay for and trade on Inside Information.
For example, between in or about December 2016, when he registered for a Dark Web site
known as AlphaBay Market, and in or about July 2017, when AlphaBay ceased operations,
TROVIAS offered for sale and sold stock tips that were based on non-public inside
information about certain securities issuers and which could be purchased individually, or as
weekly or monthly subscriptions.
At various times between in or about June 2017 and February 2020, TROVIAS sold Inside
Information directly to purchasers, using encrypted messaging and email services to
communicate about the sale, rather than exclusively through the marketplace features of the
Dark Web forums. For instance, TROVIAS offered for sale and did sell, among other
confidential information belonging to various securities issuers, for approximately $5,000 in
Bitcoin, at least one pre-release earnings report misappropriated from a publicly-traded
company.
In or about 2020, TROVIAS also took steps to design and build a website to facilitate the
purchase and sale of material, non-public information for use in stock trading (the “Inside
Information Auction Site”). TROVIAS planned to use the Inside Information Auction Site to
enrich himself by charging membership fees and commissions from individuals using the
Inside Information Auction Site to engage in the unlawful trade of Inside Information.
