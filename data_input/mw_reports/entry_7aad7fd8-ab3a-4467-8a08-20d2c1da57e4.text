In March 2021, another REvil's attack was announced. Targeting the computer giant Acer,
the actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have
demanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April
2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020,
REvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of
REvil and share the techniques they used in operations.

What is REvil
REvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a
Russian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider. The group is
believed to be based in Russia, as it does not attack organizations in Post-Soviet States, and
refuse to cooperate with English speaking cyber criminals.[2]

REvil was highly possible the successor of GandCrab, another notorious ransomware,
because of code similarities and REvil's active operations right after GandCrab's retirement.

Numerous campaigns attacking multiple sectors were observed all over the world. The REvil
actors has attacked local governments, giant law firms, multinational retailers, etc. The
highest ransom they have asked was 42 million for the law firm but was now surpassed by
the 50 million Acer attack. (References for the events, please see the end of this page.[4])

The Ransomware as a Service model (RaaS)
The actors of REvil adopt the Ransomware as a Service business model. In this model,
Ransomware developers are responsible for development and maintenance of the
ransomware, while the groups of cyber criminals, named affiliates in this model, are

responsible for accessing victims' system to distribute the ransomware. The business model
allows cyber criminals who are not capable of developing their own ransomware to buy the
service on dark web and deploy ransomware attack.
Through this model, REvil actors provide REvil or the customized version of REvil to their
affiliates. After they successfully breached victims' systems, REvil actors will ask for ransom
by themselves, providing the ransom payment link. After the collection of money, their
affiliates will receive 60% to 75% of the profit. Moreover, the actors also provide other paid
services, such as money laundering assistance for the affiliates.

Tactic, Techniques and Procedures
4/7

Initial Access
For REvil, different affiliates may use different methods for initial access. The ransomware is
now distributed primarily through compromised RDP sessions (65%), phishing (16%), and
software vulnerabilities (8%).[5] However, a supply chain attack distributing REvil was also
observed.
REvils' actors said in an interview that they used brute force attacks to compromise RDP
sessions.[1] As for phishing emails, the cyber criminals have once disguised their email as a
new booking from "booking.com". They also exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, REvil's debut was
exploiting the Oracle Weblogic vulnerability, CVE-2019-2725. Moreover, the actors are able
to deploy new vulnerabilities after its disclosure. For example, the group used the recent
disclosed Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability to access Acer's system.
The most astounding technique they deployed is supply chain attack. Around June 2019, a
WINRAR distributor site in Italy was hacked.[6][7] The software downloaded from the site at
that time was not the WINRAR installer but the REvil installer. Although no public
announcements showing that any company was infected in this attack, the successful
replacement shows that their affiliates were able to deploy a supply chain attack.
Apart from their various method on initial access, the cyber criminals also adopted several
unique techniques. For example, REvil used Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange to
encrypt files, while other ransomware often used RSA, Salsa20 or AES to do so. This
method is more efficient as it used shorter key and is difficult to decrypt.

The Effective Methods for Ransom Collection
Nowadays, as ransomware attacks become a serious problem, most companies have
learned to back up crucial data in case they are hit by a ransomware. However, ransomware
actors develop several new methods to ensure that the victims will pay the ransom, including
Double-extortion, VoIP calling, and DDoS attack.
"Double-extortion" The actors disclose or sell the data of the company if the company is
not willing to pay ransom. This method was first introduced by Maze, another notorious
ransomware, and currently almost all ransomware actors have adopted this method,
and so as REvil. Starting from January 2020, the group runs their own site "Happy
Blog", where they post data extorted from their victims.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling In February 2021, they announced that they
are now offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling and DDoS attack service for
their affiliates to make pressure on their victims.[8] They stated that they will call the
media or their victims' business partners, telling them about the attack.

5/7

Detect and Defense
For prevention, it is always crucial to be aware of spamming emails. Nowadays, spamming
emails is still the most popular and effective method to access victims' computers.
In addition, keep an eye on new exploits and updates is also important. Ransomware groups
usually are not capable of discovering 0-day exploits by themselves, but they will exploit the
disclosed vulnerabilities and attack those who have not updated their system. Thus, keep
computers updated and patched systems immediately after the disclosure is essential for
preventing ransomware attack.
Furthermore, as the REvil business grows, the actors behind has posted on dark web to
recruit more affiliates for their operations. Thus, more attacks from the group is expected.
TeamT5 will keep following the ransomware and provide up-to-date information of the
notorious ransomware.
To efficiently prevent ransomware attacks, TeamT5 offers a total solution for enterprise
protection. Our unique ransomware containment technology is proven to successfully block
many types of ransomware, which can detect and stop malicious ransomware immediately.
And even restore encrypted files from the backup.
