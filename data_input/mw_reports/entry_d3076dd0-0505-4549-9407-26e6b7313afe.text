hacks for Moscow

Biden administration sanctions six Russian companies over cyber activities
List includes well-known Moscow security firm Positive Technologies
US officials privately believe Positive provides hacking tools and support to Russian
intelligence
The hackers at Positive Technologies are undeniably good at what they do. The Russian
cybersecurity firm regularly publishes highly-regarded research, looks at cutting edge
computer security flaws, and has spotted vulnerabilities in networking equipment, telephone
signals, and electric car technology.
But American intelligence agencies have concluded that this $1 billion company—which is
headquartered in Moscow, but has offices around the world— does much more than that.
Positive was one of a number of technology businesses sanctioned by the US on Thursday
for its role in supporting Russian intelligence agencies. President Joe Biden declared a
national emergency to deal with the threat he says Moscow poses to the United States. But
the details of the sanctions released by the Treasury Department only cover a small fraction
of what the Americans now believe about Positive’s role in Russia.

MIT Technology Review understands that US officials have privately concluded that the
company is a major provider of offensive hacking tools, knowledge, and even operations to
Russian spies. Positive is believed to be part of a constellation of private sector firms and
cybercriminal groups that support Russia’s geopolitical goals, and which the US increasingly
views as a direct threat.

Days before Microsoft released a fix for a secret attack on its email systems, hackers
ramped up their activity. Now experts say swift action is required.
The public side of Positive is like many cybersecurity companies: staff look at high-tech
security, publish research on new threats, and even have cutesy office signs that read “stay
positive!” hanging above their desks. The company is open about some of its links to the
Russian government, and boasts an 18-year track record of defensive cybersecurity
expertise including a two-decade relationship with the Russian Ministry of Defense. But
according to previously unreported US intelligence assessments, it also develops and sells
weaponized software exploits to the Russian government.

One area that’s stood out is the firm’s work on SS7, a technology that’s critical to global
telephone networks. In a public demonstration for Forbes, Positive showed how it can
bypass encryption by exploiting weaknesses in SS7. Privately, the US has concluded that
Positive did not just discover and publicize flaws in the system, but also developed offensive
hacking capabilities to exploit security holes that were then used by Russian intelligence in
cyber campaigns.
Much of what Positive does for the Russian government’s hacking operations is similar to
what American security contractors do for United States agencies. But there are major
differences. One former American intelligence official, who requested anonymity because
they are not authorized to discuss classified material, described the relationship between
companies like Positive and their Russian intelligence counterparts as “complex” and even
“abusive.” The pay is relatively low, the demands are one-sided, the power dynamic is
skewed, and the implicit threat for non-cooperation can loom large.

Tight working relationship
American intelligence agencies have long concluded that Positive also runs actual hacking
operations itself, with a large team allowed to run its own cyber campaigns as long as they
are in Russia’s national interest. Such practices are illegal in the western world: American
private military contractors are under direct and daily management of the agency they’re
working for during cyber contracts.
US intelligence has concluded that Positive did not just discover and publicize flaws,
but also developed offensive hacking capabilities to exploit security holes that it found
Former US officials say there is a tight working relationship with the Russian intelligence
agency FSB that includes exploit discovery, malware development, and even reverse
engineering of cyber capabilities used by Western nations like the United States against
Russia itself.
The company’s marquee annual event, Positive Hack Days, was described in recent US
sanctions as “recruiting events for the FSB and GRU.” The event has long been famous for
being frequented by Russian agents.
NSA director of cybersecurity Rob Joyce said the companies being sanctioned "provide a
range of services to the SVR, from providing the expertise to developing tools, supplying
infrastructure and even, sometimes, operationally supporting activities,” Politico reported.
One day after the sanctions announcement, Positive issued a statement denying “the
groundless accusations” from the US. It pointed out that there is “no evidence” of wrongdoing
and said it provides all vulnerabilities to software vendors “without exception.”

Tit for tat

3/4

Thursday’s announcement is not the first time that Russian security companies have come
under scrutiny.
The biggest Russian cybersecurity company, Kaspersky, has been under fire for years over
its relationships with the Russian government—eventually being banned from US
government networks. Kaspersky has always denied a special relationship with the Russian
government.
But one factor that sets Kaspersky apart from Positive, at least in the eyes of American
intelligence officials, is that Kaspersky sells antivirus software to western companies and
governments. There are few better intelligence collection tools than an antivirus, software
which is purposely designed to see everything happening on a computer, and can even take
control of the machines it occupies. US officials believe Russian hackers have used
Kaspersky software to spy on Americans, but Positive—a smaller company selling different
products and services—has no equivalent.
Recent sanctions are the latest step in a tit for tat between Moscow and Washington over
escalating cyber operations, including the Russian-sponsored SolarWinds attack against the
US, which led to nine federal agencies being hacked over a long period of time. Earlier this
year, the acting head of the US cybersecurity agency said recovering from that attack could
take the US at least 18 months.
