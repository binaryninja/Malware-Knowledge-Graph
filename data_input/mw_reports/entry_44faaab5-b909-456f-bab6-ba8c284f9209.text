Executive Summary
While researching prevalent commodity Remote Access Tools (RATs), Unit 42 researchers
discovered a new, undocumented RAT in September, which had almost 50 samples
observed in more than 2,200 attack sessions within the first month it was sold. In this report,
we document the RAT manager/builder, client malware, and profile the Swedish actor behind
this together with his promotion and sale of his malware. We also document this RAT already
being used in malicious attacks in the wild.

Promoting his RAT
1/16

During the first week of September 2019, the actor started promoting his new RAT on several
underground forums (Figure 1), using the handles Speccy and Rafiki. The succinct posts
shared a link to his sales site blackremote[.]pro, and his discord handle Speccy#0100.

Figure 1. RAT promoted on forums
During the same week, he posted a YouTube video (Figure 2), with instructions for setting up
his RAT.

The YouTube description (Figure 3) included a link to his personal site speccy[.]dev. It also
included the claim “this rat is fully runtime undetected” and a link to “purchase FUD crypter.”
There is no legitimate reason for this software to need to be “undetectable” or “crypted.”
Rather, such efforts are intended to prevent detection by antimalware software.

Figure 3. YouTube description

blackremote[.]pro
The sales site for Blackremote RAT, blackremote[.]pro (Figure 4), was registered on August
19, 2019.

Figure 4. blackremote[.]pro
Speccy describes his RAT:
“Black Remote Controller PRO is a powerful and full featured systems remote admnistration
suite. It will give you full access and control over a remote machine through a countless
number of features, giving you the ability to monitor, access or manipulate every activity and
data remotely, just like you are in front of it!”
As is typical with other malicious RATs promoted at the same underground forums, Speccy
claims legitimate purpose:
“This tool is ideal for everyone who necessitate to access, monitor or operate remotely on a
given system for a wide and various range of needs, administration professionals, parental
control, forensics, sourveillance [sic], remote assistance. Black will become for you an
incredible tool to achieve everything remotely.”
However, the previously mentioned claims of being “undetectable” and references to
crypting, together with features such as “Password Recovery” and his “Fun Features” (Figure
5) advertising (“We all know sometimes things may get boring, expecially [sic] in professional
and tech environment“ … “Black Remote Controller may become also a funny tool for jokes,
why not?”) are hardly in keeping with a tool designed for legitimate purpose.

Figure 5. "Fun Features"
Speccy licenses (Figure 6) his RAT at a comparatively high price compared to other
commodity RATs. With $49 for a 31-day license, $117 for 93 days, and $438 for one year.

Figure 6. Purchase
The purchase itself is through various cryptocurrencies, using third-party payment service
vsell[.]io (Figure 7).

Manager / Builder
The purchaser is given a Sendspace download link for the Blackremote manager / builder
software, together with the password for the 6 Mb RAR.
Unpacking the manager / builder installs a 9Mb main executable BLACK-RC.EXE, a pair of
resource libraries, and a resource directory with a pair of .wav files.

Figure 8. Manager / builder registration / login
Upon loading the manager / builder, the user is given a registration / login screen (Figure 8).
Blackremote utilizes the third-party “CodeVEST” licensing system, also peddled on
underground forums. The licensing system validates by connecting to codevest[.]sh.
“CodeVEST” seems to take the place of “Netseal” as a registration service used by
commodity malware. The author of “Netseal”, Taylor Huddleston, was charged in 2017 for
that operation together with the sale of his own commodity malware, “Nanocore RAT.” The
same person who offers the “Codevest” licensing service, also profits from a crypting service
“Cyber Seal”. This highlights the role in the commodity malware ecosystem of not only the
malware sellers, but also service providers such as the licensing services they use, and the
crypting services they purchase to avoid detection of the malware that they build.

Figure 9. CodeVEST
The Blackremote manager / builder (Figure 10) allows the user to build new client malware to
their configuration, and to control connections from those infected clients.

The manager / builder allows the user to define actions-upon-connect for client connections
(Figure 11), a connection log (Figure 12), and the ability to list (Figure 13) and interact with
connected clients.

The client-control features advertised by Speccy are exposed in the context menu for
connected clients (Figure 14).

Speccy is actively developing this software. The changelog shows incremental
improvements on a regular basis, such as the newly-added client privilege escalation (Figure
15).

Client
We note that different samples from similar time periods have been observed with identical
file sizes. We suspect that regardless of dynamic content, such as C2 information or differing
RAT options, that the obfuscation process in the building of the client may make all clients of
a specific Blackremote version level identical in file size.
Both the builder and client are heavily protected, using more than one obfuscator (
Agile.NET, Babel .NET, Crypto Obfuscator, Dotfuscator, Goliath.NET, SmartAssembly,
Spices.Net, Xenocode).

In the Wild
Although Blackremote is very new, as of the time of this report we are already seeing it used
in attacks. A month after Speccy started selling Blackremote RAT, we have almost 50
samples observed in more than 2,200 attack sessions against Palo Alto Networks
customers.

A Customer
Interestingly, just one campaign seems to be responsible for the vast majority of those
attacks. The file doc00190910.exe (SHA256:
2b3cda455f68a9bbbeb1c2881b30f1ee962f1c136af97bdf47d8c9618b980572), was spread
by email, peaking September 9-11, 2019. It targeted Palo Alto Networks customers in varied
verticals (Figure 16), worldwide. It uses renaj.duckdns[.]org (103.200.6[.]79) as a Commandand-Control (C2) server. We observed this used in over 1800 attack sessions.

13/16

Figure 16. Campaign victim verticals
The same C2 has been observed being used by the actor in over 50 Netwire, Nanocore,
Quasar, and Remcos commodity RAT samples back to early 2018.
This is a clear illustration of how the authors of commodity RATs such as Blackremote profit,
while enabling malicious cyber attacks.

Conclusion
Commodity RATs are often sold on the internet for years, their authors profiting while
enabling malicious actors to spread thousands of samples of malware, built with their RAT
builders.
The opportunity to document a RAT within days of its emergence, and to identify the
individual behind it – in this case, an 18-year-old from Sweden, will hopefully enable
authorities to take timely action against this actor, and his customers. Unit 42 has fully
identified this actor; we will not share his identity here, but we have ensured that the correct
authorities have been advised. The longer this is sold, not only the more samples of this RAT
will be built and spread, but also the opportunity for other actors to crack this RAT and
distribute it indiscriminately. It is important to identify and interdict the sale of such malware
as early as possible to prevent its proliferation, which enables a large population of
unsophisticated threat actors.

14/16

Organizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration, and up-to-date
Windows hosts have a much lower risk of infection. Palo Alto Networks customers are further
protected from this threat. Our threat prevention platform detects Blackremote malware, with
Wildfire and Traps. AutoFocus users can track this activity using the Blackremote tag.
Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of
compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members
use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically
disrupt malicious cyber actors. For more information on the Cyber Threat Alliance, visit
