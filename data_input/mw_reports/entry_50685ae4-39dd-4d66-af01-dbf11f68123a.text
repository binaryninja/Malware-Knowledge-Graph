1. INTRODUCTION
The Russian invasion of Georgia was preceded by an intensive build up
of cyberattacks attempting to disrupt, deface and bring down critical
Georgian governmental and civilian online infrastructure. These attacks
became a massive assault on the eve of the invasion which resulted in
the blocking, re-routing of traffic and control being seized of various
sections of Georgian cyberspace. The attack marks a new phase in the
history of warfare, being the first case in which a land invasion was coordinated with an orchestrated online cyber-offensive. This offers
crucial lessons for strategists and planners whilst providing vital
information about how the Russian Federation is developing its
offensive capacities on the internet.
The campaign has been reported in the media, with wide coverage
suggesting the campaign was a spontaneous outburst of popular
feeling in Russia lead by independent hackers. However, as this report
suggests, the offensive was too large, coordinated, and sophisticated
to be the work of independent hackers; the evidence leads by-andlarge to the Russian Business Network (RBN) in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Whilst only a criminal investigation can directly prove the involvement
of the Kremlin, both experts and commentators have accused
Moscow of sponsoring the attacks as their magnitude requires the
involvement of the kind of resources only a state-sponsor can provide.
2. BACKGROUND ON CYBERWARFARE
Cyberattacks are becoming an increasingly established and virulent
form of warfare in the early Twenty-First Century. High technology and
online skills are now available for rent to a variety of customers,
including private individuals and terrorist organizations, and can
potentially destabilize a country’s whole economy and crucial security
infrastructure. Cyberwarfare has found its primary state-sponsor in the
Russian Federation, which is widely suspected of having played a
leading role in the first large scale cyberattack on a NATO member
state last year.
In the spring of 2007 government computers in Estonia came under
sustained attack from cyberterrorists following the decision taken by
Estonian officials to move a statue placed commemorating a Red
Army soldier that died fighting the Nazis, to the military cemetery in the
capital Tallinn. The event roused emotions and led to large scale
protests by the Russian minority. It was then that the Estonian
Government’s online networks came under massive assault using
2

Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDoS) assaults on its infrastructure. The
attacks, which flooded computers and servers, blocking legitimate
users were described as ‘crippling’ by experts, owing to Estonia’s high
dependence on information technology. Commentators have pointed
out that the assault had very serious consequences for Estonia`s banks
and airports. Consequences similar in effect to a full scale missile strike.
This provided vital lessons for Estonia and NATO and has led to the
development of a cutting edge cyberwarfare institute in Tallinn.
3. RUSSIA’S ONLINE WAR ON GEORGIA: FIRST STRIKE
In August 2008, cyberwar associated with the Russian Federation struck
once more, this time against Georgia. The DDoS attacks began in the
weeks running up to the outbreak of the Russian invasion and
continued after the Kremlin announced that it had ceased hostilities on
12 August. Georgian claims have been confirmed by Tom Burling, an
executive of Tulip Systems, a U.S. Internet firm, which took over hosting
of the web sites for Georgia's government agencies during the conflict.
In a recent interview Burling said its experts had worked frantically to
curtail the damage from the hackers, remarking that "They have been
attacking Georgia from a cyber standpoint since July." Some of the
Western sources confirm this claim.
On 20 July the Shadowserver Foundation published news about the
serious attack against the website of the President of Georgia: “For
over 24 hours the website of President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia
(www.president.gov.ge) has been rendered unavailable due to a
multi-pronged distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.”
Computerworld, 21 July: “The Web site for the president of Georgia was
knocked offline by a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack over
the weekend, yet another in a series of cyberattacks against countries
experiencing political friction with Russia.”
New York Times, 12 August: “Weeks before bombs started falling on
Georgia, a security researcher in suburban Massachusetts was watching an
attack against the country in cyberspace.”

The Russian invasion of Georgia was preceded by a cyber attack on
Georgia’s Internet facilities. A large number of Georgia’s Internet
servers were seized and placed under external control from late
Thursday, 7 August, whereas Russia’s invasion of Georgia officially
commenced on Friday, 8 August. Also, much of Georgia’s traffic and
access was taken under unauthorized external control at the same
time that this first large scale attack occurred.
The defacement of President Mikheil Saakashvili web site
president.gov.ge with the screen-shot provided below which operated
as a moving slideshow was part of the initial phase of the attack. What
3

followed were large numbers of DDoS against the site designed to
prevent the Georgian government from getting its message across to
the general population and international media during this critical
time.

Dancho Danchev is an independent security consultant and cyber
threats analyst, with extensive experience in open source intelligence
gathering, malware and E-crime incident response. As an expert in the
field, he views the defacement attacks as clearly being Kremlin linked
and not undertaken by independent or un-coordinated attackers.
•

“What am I trying to imply? It smells like a three letter intelligence
agency’s propaganda arm has managed to somehow supply
the creative for the defacement of Georgia President’s official
web site, thereby forgetting a simple rule of engagement in such
a conflict - risk forwarding the responsibility of the attack to each
and every Russian or Russian supporter that ever attacked
Georgian sites using publicly obtainable DDoS attack tools in a
coordinated fashion.”

An example of Russian efforts to shut the mouse of Georgian media is
the story of the Georgian news agency GHN. The first attack against
the agency’s website occurred in August 2008. Another wave of cyber
attacks started on 8 September. As a result, the GHN news agency
website had been paralyzed for 2 weeks. Another Georgian media
website that came under consistent cyber attacks after the end of the
armed conflict is www.apsny.ge – website of the Georgia-Online news
agency. It is interesting to note that Russian efforts to prevent Georgian

4

Internet media resources from disseminating information continued
even after the war.
4. CYBER BLOCKADE
The Russian assault on Georgian cyberspace was intensely coordinated and directed out of St. Petersburg, inside the territory of the
Russian Federation. The primary orchestrator was the Russian Business
Network (RBN) which conducted the cyber-blockade so that all
Georgian Internet traffic was going through Russia, denying Georgia its
internet independence. Computers in Georgia showed that an assault
was clearly taking place, which is presented here as evidence of
Russian sponsored cyber-terrorism:
•

Two trace routes for the web site mfa.gov.ge, that of the Georgian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were showing:
(a) From US - Ge = Blocked via TTnet Turkey
(b) From Ukraine - Ge = available & slow; not accessible, cached
(forged page) now only via redirect through Bryansk.ru

•

Other Georgia government websites such as mod.gov.ge, the
website of the Georgian Ministry of Defense and the web site
president.gov.ge, the web site of the Georgian Presidency showed
(c) From US - Ge = Blocked via TTnet Turkey
(d) From Ukraine - Ge = Blocked via TTnet Turkey

By examining Internet routes before and after the beginning of the war,
it is clear that they were altered either legally or illegally, blocking
traffic in and out of Georgia. Some of those routers are known to be
under control of the Russian Business Network (RBN). This can be
demonstrated via a comparison of route configuration before and
after the war.
5. SITES PROVIDING DDOS ATTACK TOOLS
Here we can provide clear evidence of co-ordination and a full list of
targets the cyber-terrorists had selected taken from the Russian hosted
web site stopgeorgia.ru (which also appears as stopgeorgia.info a
redirected page). This site provided the necessary attack tools for the
cyber assault against Georgia for hackers. As we can see the screenshot shows that mostly .ge web sites are listed for priority attacks.
However - also targeted for assault is the US embassy in Tbilisi. This web
site, as seen before, is an open site to attract future FSB cyber warriors.
The following evidence below shows how these sites can be traced
back to the Russian Business Network (RBN) in ST. Petersburg and other
cybercriminal locations.

5

•

The information site Stopgeorgia.ru which provided information and
tools for independent hackers to attack Georgian sites was hosted
by AS36351 Softlayer of Plano Texas. This is a well known location
that is associated with Atrivo and Intercage malware hosting
connectivity, which is highly disruptive to online service.

•

The information site Stopgeorgia.info was hosted by AS28753
NETDIRECT in Frankfurt, Germany as well as in AS12578 APOLLO
LATTELEKOM APOLLO in Latvia.

The link back to the Russian Business Network (RBN) was provided by
the clues left in the registration, which reads as:
•

Sponsoring
Registrar:
EstDomains,
Inc.
Registrant: Domain Manager, Protect Details, Inc, Street1: 29
Kompozitorov St., Saint Petersburg, RU, Phone:+7.8129342271

In summary, 36 important web sites were identified as targets for
hackers, including the US and UK Embassies in Tbilisi, Georgian
Parliament, Georgian Supreme Court, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, various
news agencies and other media resources, the Central Election
Commission, and many others.

6

Due to efforts of many IT specialists in Internet hosting routing
companies, normal traffic was mostly resumed after the initial strikes.
Most critical websites were hosted outside of Georgia.
6. PART OF THE INFORMATION WAR
To help to make a final judgment regarding the cyberwar against
Georgia these two declarations from Russian officials can help us to
evaluate how Moscow thinks in regard to online warfare. The Russian
State Duma deputy and member of the Security Committee Deputy
Nikolai Kuryanovich stated in 2006 within a formal Russian
parliamentary letter of appreciation to hackers who had taken down
several Israeli web sites:
•

"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the
open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with
the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers. This means that a

7

small force of hackers is stronger than the multi-thousand force of
the current armed forces."
Should we interpret this declaration as a statement of intent, or merely
a prediction? A few days ago, the Editor of the Russian Online journal
cybersecurity.ru, made a similar statement that provides insight into the
Russian war aims:
•

“Cyber-attacks are part of the information war, making your enemy
shut up is a potent weapon of modern warfare.”

Clear examples that such thinking is being applied as guiding principles
of Russian strategy as part of the intense information-war taking place
can be drawn from the second wave of attacks that showed up from
Russian Business Network (RBN) server range. This time the weapon was
a new campaign purporting to come from the BBC that mocked
Georgia's President and spread as a new virus.
The malware from various locations caused the virus to be delivered
from
a
single
site,
(IP
address:
79.135.167.49).
The name of the malware is "name.avi.exe", and as of September 2008,
only FOUR out of 36 anti-virus products could detect it. The Russian
Business Network (RBN) had created a highly virulent strain designed to
act as a propaganda weapon against Georgia.
7. RUSSIAN BUSINESS NETWORK
The individual, with direct responsibility for carrying out the cyber "first
strike" on Georgia, is a RBN operative named Alexandr A. Boykov of
Saint Petersburg, Russia. Also involved in the attack was a programmer
and spammer from Saint Petersburg named Andrey Smirnov. These
men are leaders of RBN sections and are not "script-kiddies" or
"hacktivists," as some have maintained of the cyber attacks on Georgia
– but senior operatives in positions of responsibility with vast
background knowledge.
Intelligence can suggest further information about these individual
cyber-terrorists. According to Spamhaus SBL64881, Mr. Boykov operates
a hosting service in Class C Network 79.135.167.0/24. It should be noted
that the pre-invasion attacks emanated from 79.135.167.22, clearly
showing professional planning and not merely ‘hacktivism.’ Due to the
degree of professionalism and the required massive costs to run such
operations, a state-sponsor is suspected. Further information gathered
also links the RBN to known disruptive websites.
•

The IP addresses of the range, 79.135.160.0/19 are assigned to
Sistemnet Telecom to provide services to companies who are
classified as engaging in illicit activities such as credit card fraud,
malware and so on.

8

•

79.135.160.0/19 Sistemnet Telecom and AS9121 TTNet (Turkey) are
associated with AbdAllah_Internet which is linked with cybercrime
hosting such as thecanadianmeds.com. These are known Russian
Business Network routes.

8. THE 27 AUGUST ATTACK
The last large cyberattack took place on 27 August. After that, there
have been no serious attacks on Georgian cyberspace. By that is
meant that minor attacks are still continuing but these are
indistinguishable from regular traffic and can certainly be attributed to
regular civilians.
On 27 August, at approximately 16:18 (GMT +3) a DDoS attack against
the Georgian websites was launched. The main target was the
Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The attacks peaked at approx 0,5 million network packets per second,
and up to 200–250 Mbits per second in bandwidth (see attached
graphs). The graphs represent a 5-minute average: actual peaks were
higher.

9

The attacks mainly consisted of HTTP queries to the http://mfa.gov.ge
website. These were requests for the main page script with randomly
generated parameters. These requests were generated to overload
the web server in a way where every single request would need
significant
CPU
time.
The initial wave of the attack disrupted services for some Georgian
websites. The services became slow and unresponsive. This was due to
the
load
on
the
servers
by
these
requests.
As you see from the graphs above the attacks started to wind down
after most of the attackers were successfully blocked. The latest attack
may have been initiated as a response to the media coverage on the
Russian cyber attacks.

CONCLUSION
The information presented in here catalogues and explains the historic
first major use of cyberattacks as a weapon of war during the Russian
aggression against Georgia. Considering that this is the second Russiansponsored cyber-attack in just over a year, as well as the alarming fact
that the US Embassy in Tbilisi was listed for assault by cyberterrorists,
NATO member states as well as NATO aspirant countries need to be on
full alert for future Russian aggression against critical online
infrastructure.

SHADOWSERVER
20 July 2008; Updated on 10 August 2008
The Website for the President of Georgia Under Attack - Politically Motivated?

For over 24 hours the website of President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia
(www.president.gov.ge) has been rendered unavailable due to a multi-

11

pronged distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The site began coming
under attack very early Saturday morning (Georgian time). Shadowserver has
observed at least one web-based command and control (C&C) server taking
aim at the website hitting it with a variety of simultaneous attacks. The C&C
server has instructed its bots to attack the website with TCP, ICMP, and HTTP
floods.
Commands seen so far are:
flood http www.president.gov.ge/
flood tcp www.president.gov.ge
flood icmp www.president.gov.ge
The server [62.168.168.9] which houses the website has been largely offline
since the attack started. Passive DNS records show the system houses several
other websites which are mostly unrelated to the Georgian government.
However, the server does also host the Social Assistance and Employment
State Agency website (www.saesa.gov.ge). This website along with the others
on the host have been rendered inaccessible.
Is the attack political or perhaps nationalistic in nature? Your guess is as good
as ours but it doesn't take much to come to this possible conclusion. Recent
DDoS attacks against various other neighbors of Russia to include Estonia
have been quite popular in the last few years. We do not have any solid
proof that the people behind this C&C server are Russian. However, the HTTPbased botnet C&C server is a MachBot controller, which is a tool that is
frequently used by Russian bot herders. On top of that the domain involved
with this C&C server has seemingly bogus registration information but does tie
back to Russia.
Who else have these guys been attacking with this MachBot C&C server? The
answer is no one. This server recently came online in the past few weeks and
has not issued any other attacks that we have observed until recently. All
attacks we have observed have been directed right at
www.president.gov.ge.
The C&C server involved in these attacks is on the IP address 207.10.234.244,
which is subsequently located in the United States. Beaconing traffic from
your network to this host may indicate that you have infected machines on
your network and are most likely participating in this DDoS attack. We would
recommend blocking and/or monitoring for traffic to this address.
Update (7/20/2008: 1:36 PM EST): It appears the host site for 207.10.234.244 has
taken action against this system and appears to now be blocking access to it.
However, the server being targeted by the C&C is still unreachable.
Update (8/10/2008: 10:34 AM EDT): With the recent events in Georgia, we are
now seeing new attacks against .ge sites. www.parliament.ge &
president.gov.ge are currently being hit with http floods. In this case, the C&C
server involved is at IP address 79.135.167.22 which is located in Turkey. We
are also observing this C&C as directing attacks against www.skandaly.ru.

12

Traffic from your network to this IP or domain name of
googlecomaolcomyahoocomaboutcom.net may indicate compromise and
participation in these attacks.

Georgia president's Web site falls under DDOS attack
Botnet took down site for one day
The Web site for the president of Georgia was knocked offline by a distributed
denial-of-service (DDOS) attack over the weekend, yet another in a series of
cyberattacks against countries experiencing political friction with Russia.
Georgia's presidential Web site was down for about a day, starting early
Saturday until Sunday, according to the Shadowserver Foundation, which
tracks malicious Internet activity.
Network experts said the attack was executed by a botnet, or a network of
computers that can be commanded to overwhelm a Web site with too much
traffic.
The command-and-control server for the attack is based in the U.S.,
Shadowserver said. The botnet appears to be based on the "MachBot" code,
which communicates to other compromised PCs over HTTP, the same
protocol used for transmitting Web pages.
The tool used to control this kind of botnet "is frequently used by Russian bot
herders," according to Shadowserver. "On top of that, the domain involved
with this [command-and-control] server has seemingly bogus registration
information but does tie back to Russia."
One of the commands contained in the traffic directed at the Web site
contained the phrase "win+love+in+Rusia," wrote Jose Nazario, a senior
security engineer at Arbor Networks, on a company blog.
On Sunday, it appeared that the host for the command-and-control server
had been taken offline, Shadowserver said.
The motivation for the attacks is not entirely clear. But Georgia is just one of
several former Soviet satellites, including Estonia and Lithuania, that are
seeking to downplay their historical legacy with Russia.
Georgia has angered Russia by pushing for entry to NATO, a pro-Western
security alliance. It has also tangled with Russia over the handling of South
Ossetia and Abkhazia, two rebellious regions pushing for independence.

13

In Lithuania, 300 Web sites were defaced around July 1 following a new law
prohibiting the public display of symbols dating from the Soviet era and the
playing of the Soviet national anthem. The hacking was blamed on an
unpatched vulnerability in a Web server at a hosting company.
Estonian Web sites were pounded by a massive DDOS attack in April and May
2007. The attacks are believed to have been connected to a decision to
move a monument honoring Soviet World War II soldiers to a less prominent
place, which ignited protests from ethnic Russians.

Cyberattacks knock out Georgia's Internet presence
Large-scale attacks, traffic rerouting traced to Russian hacker hosting network
August 11, 2008 (Computerworld) Hackers, perhaps affiliated with a wellknown Russian criminal network, have attacked and hijacked Web sites
belonging to Georgia, the former Soviet republic now in the fourth day of war
with Russia, a security researcher claimed on Sunday.
Some Georgian government and commercial sites are unavailable, while
others may have been hijacked, said Jart Armin, a researcher who tracks the
notorious Russian Business Network (RBN), a malware and criminal hosting
network.
"Many of Georgia's Internet servers were under external control from late
Thursday," Armin said early Saturday in an entry on his Web site. According to
his research, the government's sites dedicated to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, and the country's president, Mikhail
Saakashvili, have been blocked completely, or traffic to and from those sites'
servers have been redirected to servers actually located in Russia and Turkey.
As of midnight Eastern time on Sunday, Georgia's presidential and defense
ministry sites were unavailable from the U.S. Although the foreign ministry's site
remained online, the most recent news item was dated Aug. 8, the day
Georgian and Russian forces first clashed.
Armin warned that Georgian sites that appeared online may actually be
bogus. "Use caution with any Web sites that appear of a Georgia official
source but are without any recent news [such as those dated Saturday, Aug.
9, or Sunday, Aug. 10], as these may be fraudulent," he said in another entry
posted midafternoon on Sunday.
Statements from Georgia's foreign ministry have appeared in a blog hosted
on Google, perhaps in an attempt to circumvent attacks.

14

Researchers at the Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks malicious Internet
activity, confirmed some of Armin's claims. "We are now seeing new attacks
against .ge sites [Editor's note: .ge is the top-level domain for Georgia.] ...
www.parliament.ge and president.gov.ge are currently being hit with HTTP
floods," the researchers said in a Sunday update to a July post.
On Saturday, Armin reported that key sections of Georgia's Internet traffic
had been rerouted through servers based in Russia and Turkey, where the
traffic was either blocked or diverted. The Russian and Turkish servers Armin
identified, he said, "are well known to be under the control of RBN and
influenced by the Russian government."
RBN, which pulled up stakes last year and shifted network operations to China
in an attempt to avoid scrutiny, has been fingered for a wide range of
criminal activities, including a massive subversion of Web sites last March.
Later on Saturday, Armin added that network administrators in Germany had
been able to temporarily reroute some Georgian Internet traffic directly to
servers run by Deutsche Telekom AG. Within hours, however, the traffic had
been again diverted to Russian servers, this time to ones based in Moscow.
The attacks are reminiscent of other coordinated campaigns against Estonian
government Web sites in April and May 2007 and against about 300
Lithuanian sites on July 1. Like Georgia, both countries are former republics in
the Soviet Union.
Three weeks ago, a distributed denial-of-service attack knocked Georgia's
presidential site offline for about a day.
Late Sunday, Russian ground forces were reported advancing toward Gori,
an important transportation hub in central Georgia.

Coordinated Russia vs Georgia cyber attack in progress (extract)

In the wake of Russian-Georgian conflict, a week worth of speculations
around Russian Internet forums have finally materialized into a coordinated
cyber attack against Georgia’s Internet infrastructure, whose tactics have
already managed to compromise several government web sites and is
continuing to launch DDoS attacks against numerous other Georgian
government sites…

Georgia: Russia 'conducting cyber war'
Several Georgian state computer servers have been under external control
since shortly before Russia's armed intervention into the state commenced on
Friday, leaving its online presence in disarray.
While the official website of Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian President, has
become available again, the central government site, as well as the
homepages for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence,
remained down. Some commercial websites have also been hijacked.
The Georgian Government said that the disruption was caused by attacks
carried out by Russia as part of the ongoing conflict between the two states
over the Georgian province of South Ossetia.
In a statement released via a replacement website built on Google's bloghosting service, the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "A cyber warfare
campaign by Russia is seriously disrupting many Georgian websites, including
that of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
Barack Obama, the Democratic US Presidential candidate, has demanded
Moscow halt the internet attacks as well as observing a ceasefire on the
ground.
Last April the computer systems of the Estonian Government came under
attack in a coordinated three-week assault widely credited to statesponsored Russian hackers. The wave of attacks came after a row erupted
over the removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, the
Estonian capital. The websites of government departments, political parties,
banks and newspapers were all targeted.
Analysts have immediately accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a
network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and
government, of the Georgian attacks.
Jart Armin, a researcher who runs a website tracking the activity of the RBN,
has released data claiming to show that visits to Georgian sites had been rerouted through servers in Russia and Turkey, where the traffic was blocked.
Armin said the servers "are well known to be under the control of RBN and
influenced by the Russian Government."
Mr Armin said that administrators in Germany had intervened at the
weekend, temporarily making the Georgian sites available by re-routing their
traffic through German servers run by Deutsche Telekom. Within hours,
however, control over the traffic had been wrested back, this time to servers
based in Moscow.
As in the barrage against Estonian websites last year, the Georgian sites are
being bombarded by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, in which

16

hackers direct their computers to simultaneously flood a site with thousands of
visits in order to overload it and bring it offline.
The Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks serious hacking, confirmed: "We
are now seeing new attacks against .ge sites - www.parliament.ge and
president.gov.ge are currently being hit with http floods."
Mr Armin warned that official Georgian sites that did appear online may have
been hijacked and be displaying bogus content. He said in a post on his site:
"Use caution with any web sites that appear of a Georgia official source but
are without any recent news ... as these may be fraudulent."

The Baltic Business News website reported that Estonia has offered to
send a specialist online security team to Georgia
However a spokesman from Estonia's Development Centre of State
Information Systems said Georgia had not made a formal request. "This
will be decided by the government," he said

Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks

Weeks before bombs started falling on Georgia, a security researcher in
suburban Massachusetts was watching an attack against the country in
cyberspace.

Jose Nazario of Arbor Networks in Lexington noticed a stream of data
directed at Georgian government sites containing the message:
“win+love+in+Rusia.”
Other Internet experts in the United States said the attacks against Georgia’s
Internet infrastructure began as early as July 20, with coordinated barrages of
millions of requests — known as distributed denial of service, or D.D.O.S.,
attacks — that overloaded and effectively shut down Georgian servers.
Researchers at Shadowserver, a volunteer group that tracks malicious
network activity, reported that the Web site of the Georgian president, Mikheil
Saakashvili, had been rendered inoperable for 24 hours by multiple D.D.O.S.
attacks. They said the command and control server that directed the attack
was based in the United States and had come online several weeks before it
began the assault.

17

As it turns out, the July attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all-out
cyberwar once the shooting started between Georgia and Russia. According
to Internet technical experts, it was the first time a known cyberattack had
coincided with a shooting war.
But it will likely not be the last, said Bill Woodcock, the research director of the
Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit organization that tracks Internet traffic. He
said cyberattacks are so inexpensive and easy to mount, with few fingerprints,
they will almost certainly remain a feature of modern warfare.
“It costs about 4 cents per machine,” Mr. Woodcock said. “You could fund
an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so
you would be foolish not to.”
Exactly who was behind the cyberattack is not known. The Georgian
government blamed Russia for the attacks, but the Russian government said it
was not involved. In the end, Georgia, with a population of just 4.6 million and
a relative latecomer to the Internet, saw little effect beyond inaccessibility to
many of its government Web sites, which limited the government’s ability to
spread its message online and to connect with sympathizers around the world
during the fighting with Russia.
It ranks 74th out of 234 nations in terms of Internet addresses, behind Nigeria,
Bangladesh, Bolivia and El Salvador, according to Renesys, a Manchester,
N.H., firm that provides performance data on the state of Internet.
Cyberattacks have far less impact on such a country than they might on a
more Internet-dependent nation, like Israel, Estonia or the United States,
where vital services like transportation, power and banking are tied to the
Internet.
In Georgia, media, communications and transportation companies were also
attacked, according to security researchers. Shadowserver saw the attack
against Georgia spread to computers throughout the government after
Russian troops entered the Georgian province of South Ossetia. The National
Bank of Georgia’s Web site was defaced at one point. Images of 20thcentury dictators as well as an image of Georgia’s president, Mr. Saakashvili,
were placed on the site. “Could this somehow be indirect Russian action?
Yes, but considering Russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs, they
could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure
kinetically,” said Gadi Evron, an Israeli network security expert. “The nature of
what’s going on isn’t clear,” he said.
The phrase “a wilderness of mirrors” usually describes the murky world
surrounding opposing intelligence agencies. It also neatly summarizes the
array of conflicting facts and accusations encompassing the cyberwar now
taking place in tandem with the Russian fighting in Georgia.
In addition to D.D.O.S. attacks that crippled Georgia’s limited Internet
infrastructure, researchers said there was evidence of redirection of Internet
traffic through Russian telecommunications firms beginning last weekend. The
attacks continued on Tuesday, controlled by software programs that were

18

located in hosting centers controlled by a Russian telecommunications firms.
A Russian-language Web site, stopgeorgia.ru, also continued to operate and
offer software for download used for D.D.O.S. attacks.
Over the weekend a number of American computer security researchers
tracking malicious programs known as botnets, which were blasting streams
of useless data at Georgian computers, said they saw clear evidence of a
shadowy St. Petersburg-based criminal gang known as the Russian Business
Network, or R.B.N.
“The attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that
have been used by the R.B.N. and in some cases the attacks are being
launched from computers they are known to control,” said Don Jackson,
director of threat intelligence for SecureWorks, a computer security firm
based in Atlanta.
He noted that in the run-up to the start of the war over the weekend,
computer researchers had watched as botnets were “staged” in preparation
for the attack, and then activated shortly before Russian air strikes began on
Saturday.
The evidence on R.B.N. and whether it is controlled by, or coordinating with
the Russian government remains unclear. The group has been linked to online
criminal activities including child pornography, malware, identity theft,
phishing and spam. Other computer researchers said that R.B.N.’s role is
ambiguous at best. “We are simply seeing the attacks coming from known
hosting services,” said Paul Ferguson, an advanced threat researcher at
Trend Micro, an Internet security company based in Cupertino, Calif. A
Russian government spokesman said that it was possible that individuals in
Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks.
“I cannot exclude this possibility,” Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the
Russian Embassy in Washington, said. “There are people who don’t agree with
something and they try to express themselves. You have people like this in
your country.”
“Jumping to conclusions is premature,” said Mr. Evron, who founded the
Israeli Computer Emergency Response Team.

Georgia targeted in cyber attack

19

Georgian government websites have been under intense cyber attack on
top of the Russian military strikes launched against the country late last week,
a US Internet firm said Tuesday.
Tulip Systems Inc said they took over hosting of the websites for Georgia's
presidency and a major television network on Saturday, a day after Russian
forces poured into Georgia in response to Tbilisi's attacks on a Moscowbacked rebel province.
Tulip executive Tom Burling said the distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks began in the weeks running up to the outbreak of the Russia-Georgia
conflict and continued Tuesday after the Kremlin announced it had ceased
hostilities in the former Soviet state.
"They have been attacking Georgia from a cyber standpoint since July,"
Burling told AFP. "They are still doing it now."
"Our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days,"
he said.
Burling suggested that Russia was behind the attacks, which are similar to a
cyber offensive waged against Estonia last year that coincided with a
diplomatic spat between the Baltic state and Moscow.
DDoS attacks consist of overloading websites with so many online requests
that systems crash.
Burling said Georgian government websites were being slammed with
hundreds of millions of simultaneous requests for documents when Tulip gave
them refuge, Burling said.
"The cyber attack was taking down every Georgian government website," he
said.
On Tuesday, the Georgian sites hosted on Tulip were still reportedly getting hit
with 68,000 requests at a time.
Russia has denied involvement in cyber assaults on Georgia and experts say it
is difficult to determine exactly who is behind such attacks.
"The Georgian government's websites have obviously been under attack,"
said Gadi Evron, an Israeli computer security specialist that investigated the
cyber assault on Estonia.
"It is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any
conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers," he said.
Evron said that such cyber warfare has become commonplace in the past
decade.

20

"These types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following
any conflict or political tension," Evron told AFP in an email.
DDoS attacks are simple, economical and hard to trace.
The assaults are typically done by using networks of computers that have
been turned into "zombies" or "bots" with malicious software planted by
hackers without the owners of machines being aware.
"Botnets" can grow to thousands or millions of machines and be commanded
to simultaneously make requests at targeted websites.
Andre DiMino, director of Shadowserver, a nonprofit Internet security
watchdog with team members around the world, warned against jumping to
the conclusion that Russia's government is the culprit in the Georgia cyber
attacks.
"This actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types -- people that jumped
on the bandwagon," DiMino said, using Internet jargon referring to political
activists that resort to online evil-doing.
Tulip's Burling said the trend of such cyber maliciousness was a cause for
concern.
"It's like the Olympics. We are supposed to be above politics in the Internet
community."
Georgian forces attacked the Moscow-backed rebel province of South
Ossetia to regain control of the region which broke away from Tbilisi in the
early 1990s.
Russian troops and tanks poured into Georgia on Friday after the Georgian
offensive.

Estonia, Poland help Georgia fight cyber attacks
In an intriguing cyber alliance, two Estonian computer experts are scheduled
to arrive in Georgia by evening to keep the country's networks running amid
an intense military confrontation with Russia.
And Poland has lent space on its president's Web page for Georgia to post
updates on its ongoing conflict with Russia, which launched a military
campaign on Friday to eject Georgian troops from South Ossetia and
Abkhazia, two renegade areas with strong ties to Russia.

21

The cooperation between the former Iron Curtain allies is aimed at blunting
pro-Russian computer hackers, who have been blamed over the last few
years for cyber attacks against Estonia, Lithuania and Georgia in incidents
linked to political friction between those nations and Russia.
Two of the four experts that staff Estonia's Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) were waiting Tuesday morning in Yerevan, the capital of
Armenia, seeking permission to drive into Georgia, said Katrin Pärgmäe,
communication manager for the Estonian Informatics Center. The two officials
are also bringing humanitarian aid, she said.
Estonia is also now hosting Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, which
has been under sustained attack over the last few days.
"Let's just say we moved it," Pärgmäe said. "I know that there are interested
parties who read media so it's not good to say exactly where the hosting is."
The Web site for Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, remained up on
Tuesday morning. That site was knocked offline around mid-July after a DDOS
attack from a botnet, network experts said.
The botnet was based on the "MachBot" code, which communicates to other
compromised PCs over the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), the same
protocol used for transmitting Web pages. MachBot code has been known to
be used by Russian bot herders, according to the Shadowserver Foundation,
which tracks malicious Internet activity.
Shadowserver said Monday that hackers had at one point defaced the Web
site for Georgia's parliament. "The attackers have inserted a large image
made up of several smaller side-by-side images of pictures of both the
Georgian President and Adolf Hitler," the group wrote.
Georgia is now also hosting some sites in the U.S., a logical move to better
defend the sites against attacks, Pärgmäe said. Shadowserver wrote that the
presidential site appeared to have been moved to an IP (Internet protocol)
address belonging to Tulip Systems, an ISP in Atlanta, Georgia.
The country is also looking to other ways to keep information flowing. A
Georgian news site was also up, but the site warned it was under "permanent
DDOS attack" That Web site has set up a group in Google's Groups service,
where subscribers can get the news stories it regularly posts.
Georgia's banking sites also suffered attacks that caused them to shut down
their online systems, said David Tabatadze, a security officer with the Georgia
Research and Educational Networking Association and Georgia's CERT. Some
of those systems are still down, he said.
Tabatadze said that the majority of Georgia's Internet traffic is routed through
Turkey, with some of it going through Russia. Although some news reports
indicated Georgia's Internet traffic may have been shifted through Russia,
Tabatadze said that's not the case.

22

"We have checked the traffic route on Ripe.net...and we did not see any
traffic re-routing via Russia," Tabatadze said.
It appears that large groups of hackers are working together to take down
the Web sites, but the attacks have been so intense that it will take a while to
analyze, Tabatadze said.
Other CERTs around the world have been helping to provide information on
the attacks, Tabatadze said.
The last few days have been a nerve-racking time for Georgians, said
Tabatadze, who said he heard explosions on Sunday when Russian planes
bombed air-traffic control stations near Tbilisi, Georgia's capital.
"You can't even imagine the situation," Tabatadze said. "This is a terrible end
for Georgia."
On Tuesday morning, Russia announced it would stop military operations in
South Ossetia and Abkhazia, saying the safety of its peacekeepers in the
region had been secured.

Russia continues cyber war on Georgia
Their assault, which began before the commencement of the five-day
Russian military offensive, has again crashed the official website of the central
government and has been widened to include a US company which
stepped in to rescue the website of Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian
President.
Tom Burling, from Tulip Systems, which began hosting the President's site on its
servers in Atlanta after it was brought down by the hackers, said his company
had become the latest target of a flood of bogus traffic sent from Russia to
crash the sites. He said the malicious visits were outnumbering legitimate ones
5000 to 1.
Mr Burling, who has reported the attacks to the FBI, said his company was
working around the clock to combat the hackers. "Our people aren't getting
any sleep," he said.
The President's website is currently accessible, as are the sites of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence, which were also brought down in the
initial wave of attacks. At one stage, photographs comparing Mr Saaskashvili
with Adolf Hitler were posted on the Foreign Ministry's site. The website of the
National Bank of Georgia has also been compromised.

23

The Russian hackers are launching waves of distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks on the websites. This means their computers, and the
computers of unsuspecting people whose home systems they have hacked
and enlisted for their "botnet", or swarm of zombie computers, are directed to
simultaneously flood a chosen site with thousands of visits in order to overload
it and bring it offline.
Last April the computer systems of the Estonian Government came under
attack in a co-ordinated three-week assault that was widely credited to
state-sponsored Russian hackers.
The Georgian Government said that the present disruption was being caused
by attacks carried out by Russia as part of the conflict between the two
states, which was triggered last week over Georgia's attempt to reassert
authority over its northern rebel province of South Ossetia.
In a statement, the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "A cyber warfare
campaign by Russia is seriously disrupting many Georgian websites, including
that of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
Analysts immediately laid the blame for the attacks on Georgian sites with the
Russian Business Network (RBN), a gang of criminal hackers which has close
links to the Russian mafia and government.
Jart Armin, a researcher who tracks RBN activity, said visitors to the Georgian
sites had been re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey, which were
"well known to be under the control of RBN and influenced by the Russian
Government."
Greg Day, a security analyst at McAfee, said increasingly hacking will be a
matter of national security.
"We can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon.
The benefits of using such methods are that no one is directly physically hurt
or killed and it is much harder to pinpoint the source and who is involved," he
told Sky News.
The hackers have also been targeting the website of Garry Kasparov, the
Russian opposition figure and former chess champion.

A New Breed Of Hackers Tracks Online Acts of War
'Hacktivists' Update Their Mission
TORONTO -- Here in the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, a new breed
of hackers is conducting digital espionage.

24

They are among a growing number of investigators who monitor how traffic is
routed through countries, where Web sites are blocked and why it's all
happening. Now they are turning their scrutiny to a new weapon of
international warfare: cyber attacks.
Tracking wars isn't what many of the researchers, who call themselves
"hacktivists," set out to do. Many began intending to help residents in
countries that censor online content. But as the Internet has evolved, so has
their mission.
Ronald J. Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab, calls the organization a "global
civil society counterintelligence agency" and refers to the lab as the "NSA of
operations."
Their efforts have ramped up in the past year as researchers gather evidence
that Internet assaults are playing a larger role in military strategy and political
struggles. Even before Georgia and Russia entered a ground war earlier this
month, Citizen Lab's researchers noticed sporadic attacks aimed at several
Georgian Web sites. Such attacks are especially threatening to countries that
increasingly link critical activities such as banking and transportation to the
Internet.
Once the fighting began, massive raids on Georgia's Internet infrastructure
were deployed using techniques similar to those used by Russian criminal
organizations. Then, attacks seemed to come from individuals who found
online instructions for launching their own assaults, shutting down much of
Georgia's communication system.
Two weeks later, researchers are still trying to trace the origins of the attacks.
"These attacks in effect had the same effect that a military attack would
have," said Rafal Rohozinski, who co-founded the Information Warfare
Monitor, which tracks cyber attacks, with Citizen Lab in 2003. "That suddenly
means that in cyberspace anyone can build an A-bomb."
The cyber attacks that disabled many Georgian and Russian Web sites earlier
this month marked the first time such an assault coincided with physical
fighting. And the digital battlefield will likely become a permanent front in
modern warfare, Deibert said.
Seven years ago, Deibert opened the Citizen Lab using grant money from the
Ford Foundation. Soon after, he and Rohozinski helped begin the OpenNet
Initiative, a collaboration with Harvard's Law School, Cambridge and Oxford
universities that tracks patterns of Internet censorship in countries that use
filters, such as China. The project received an additional $3 million from the
MacArthur Foundation. Deibert and Rohozinski also launched the Information
Warfare Monitor to investigate how the Internet is used by state military and
political operations. And Citizen Lab researchers have created a software
tool called Psiphon that helps users bypass Internet filters.
The combined projects have about 100 researchers in more than 70 countries
mapping Web traffic and testing access to thousands of sites.

25

A number of companies specialize in cyber security, and several nonprofit
organizations have formed cyber-surveillance projects to keep international
vigil over the Web. Shadowserver.org, for example, is a group of 10 volunteer
researchers who post their findings about cyber attacks online.
The small Toronto office of Citizen Lab, tucked in a basement of the
university's Munk Centre for International Studies, serves as the technological
backbone for the operations. World maps and newspaper clips cover the
walls. Researchers move between multiple computer screens, studying lists of
codes with results from field tests in Uzbekistan, Cambodia, Iran and
Venezuela, to name a few.
"We rely on local experts to help us find out why a particular site is being
blocked," Deibert said. It could be a problem with the Internet service
provider, a temporary connection glitch or a downed server. "But what's more
effective is blasting a site into oblivion when it is strategically important. It's
becoming a real arms race."
He's referring to "denial of service" attacks, in which hundreds of computers in
a network, or "botnets," simultaneously bombard a Web site with millions of
requests, overwhelming and crashing the server. In Georgia, such attacks
were strong enough to knock key sources of news and information offline for
days.
Georgian Internet service providers also limited access to Russian news media
outlets, cutting off the only remaining updates about the war. On the night of
Aug. 12 -- the height of the fighting -- "there was panic in Tbilisi brought about
by a vacuum of information," Rohozinski said.
Shadowserver saw the first denial of service attack against Georgia's
presidential Web site July 20. When the fighting began, Andre M. Di Mino,
Shadowserver's founder, counted at least six botnets launching attacks, but it
was "difficult to tell if it was a grass-roots effort or one commissioned by the
government."
The organization detects between 30 and 50 denial of service attacks every
day around the world, and Di Mino said they have become more
sophisticated over the past two years.
"It really went from almost a kiddie type of thing to where it's an organized
enterprise," he said. But he's hesitant to label this month's attacks as a form of
cyberwar, although he expects networks to play an expanded role in political
clashes.
Jose Nazario, a security researcher with Arbor Networks, said cyber attacks
used to target a computer's operating system. But he's seen a "tremendous
rise" in attacks on Web browsers, allowing attackers access to much more
personal information, such as which sites a person visits frequently. An
attacker then could learn which servers to target in order to disrupt
communication.

26

It's unclear who is behind the attacks, however. In some cases, the locations
of botnet controllers can be traced, but it's impossible to know whether an
attacker is working on the behalf of another organization or government. "It's
going to take a year to figure this out," Nazario said.
The data trail often goes cold when it crosses borders because there is little
legal framework for such investigations. And many countries, along with the
United Nations and other international bodies, are still weighing whether a
cyber attack is an act of war.
"If a state brings down the Internet intentionally, another state could very well
consider that a hostile act," said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard's
Berkman Center for Internet Society, and a principal investigator for the
OpenNet Initiative.
There are also strategic reasons not to disrupt networks in order to monitor the
enemy's conversations or to spread misinformation.
"That's an amazing intelligence opportunity," he said.
Using the Internet to control information can be more important than
disrupting the networks when it comes to military strategy, Rohozinski said. In
Georgia, for example, the lack of access to both Georgian and Russian
sources of information kept citizens in the dark while the fighting continued.
"Sometimes the objective is not to knock out the infrastructure but to
undermine the will of the people you're fighting against," he said. "It's about
the nuts and bolts, but it's also about how perceptions can be shaped
through what's available and what's not."

You’ve Got Malice
Russian nationalists waged a cyber war against Georgia. Fighting back is
virtually impossible.
On July 20, weeks before Russia stunned Georgia with a rapid invasion, the
cyber attack was already under way. While Moscow baited Georgia with
troop movements on the borders of the breakaway provinces of Abkhazia
and South Ossetia, the "zombie" computers were already on the attack.
Russian viruses had seized hundreds of thousands of computers around the
world, directing them to barrage Georgian Web sites, including the pages of
the president, the parliament, the foreign ministry, news agencies and banks,
which shut down their servers at the first sign of attack to pre-empt identity
theft. At one point the parliament's Web site was replaced by images
comparing Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili to Adolf Hitler. This was not

27

the first Russian cyber assault—that came against Estonia, in April of 2007—but
it was the first time an Internet attack paralleled one on land.
The labyrinthine ways of the Web and the complicated interfaces between
the Russian government's clandestine services and organized crime make it
impossible, at this point, to say with certainty who was responsible, or how far
up the chain of command it went. The Russian military certainly had the
means to attack Georgia's Internet infrastructure, says Jonathan Zittrain,
cofounder of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Moreover,
the attacks were too successful to have materialized independent of one
another. Bill Woodcock, the research director at Packet Clearing House, a
California-based nonprofit group that tracks Internet security trends, says the
attacks bear the markings of a "trained and centrally coordinated cadre of
professionals."
But who? Jart Armin, who has tracked Russian cybercrime, points to the
possibility that a role was played by the notorious Russian Business Network, a
cybermafia that specializes in identity theft, child pornography, extortion and
other dark and lucrative Internet crimes. The RBN's political agenda is vague
or nonexistent, but it often contracts out its services, and Armin says there is
increasing evidence that it is connected to, or at least tolerated by, the
Kremlin.
Indeed the timing is such that it's hard to discount some sort of Kremlin
coordination, even if it's impossible to prove, and Woodcock argues that such
cyber assaults have become a tool of Russian political leadership. As the
attacks' political intentions became more specific, he notes, the operations
have grown more complex. In addition to targeting Georgian government
and media Web sites, Russian hackers brought down the Russian newspaper
Skandaly.ru, apparently for expressing some pro-Georgian sentiment. "This
was the first time that they ever attacked an internal and an external target
as part of the same attack," he says.
Fighting back is tough. When Russian hackers made a name for themselves
last year by bringing down the Web site of the Estonian parliament along with
the sites of banks, ministries and newspapers, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas
Paet immediately accused the Kremlin of backing the attacks. But he was
unable to produce evidence supporting his claims. Putin eventually named a
suspect, or scapegoat, within his government. As Russian hackers waged a
similar assault on Georgian sites over the past few weeks, Estonia—one of
Europe's most wired countries—offered its better-defended servers to host
many Georgian government Web sites. Lithuania and Poland have stepped
up as well, prompting some excited bloggers to suggest that this is a digital
Sarajevo, akin to the events of August 1914, the start of the first Internet world
war. Certainly that's exaggerated, but the mutual defense going on in
cyberspace shows that these nations take the Russian threat to their online
infrastructure seriously.
Still, the nature of the Internet is such that it is almost impossible to respond
quickly enough. The government doesn't maintain its own botnets—large
networks of zombified computers standing ready to attack—but can rent one

28

from a crime network, like the Russian Business Network. Then, through statecontrolled media, the government can inspire waves of nationalists to amplify
the destructive force. "Everybody with a laptop has the responsibility to attack
the enemy—and you find out who the enemy is by looking at what the
government is saying," Woodcock says.
While no one can say who wrote the malware that was used to cause
Georgian servers to crash, it certainly proliferated on Russian Web sites in a
user-friendly form. Gary Warner, a cybercrime expert at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham, says he found "copies of the attack script" posted in
the reader comments section at the bottom of virtually every story in the
Russian media that covered the Georgian conflict, complete with instructions
on how the script could be used to attack a specific list of Web sites. The
efficiency is enough to make Russia's tanks and planes and ships, however
deadly, appear downright anachronistic.

Experts call for united global action against cyber attacks
The world has to unite against the growing menace of cyber terrorism, IT
experts said Thursday, evoking a recent "cyber war" against Georgia as the
latest example of the threat.
"The world has finally woken up and understood that cyber security needs a
global approach and is a very serious matter," Estonian politician Mart Laar
told a cyber security forum in the Estonian capital Tallinn.
Estonia had to deal with attacks on government websites blamed on Russian
hackers in the spring of 2007.
Official Georgian websites suffered a similar cyber offensive last month in the
wake of Russia's military offensive on Georgian soil. Estonia was among
several states that stepped in to host hacked Georgian websites.
"The cyber war against Georgia in August demonstrated how it has become
part of the real war on the ground and we must act," Laar added.
According to Laar, cyber attacks against the Georgian websites came a day
ahead of Russia's August 8 military action in the country, a move roundly
condemned in the West.
Robert Kramer, vice-president of public policy for CompTIA, the Computing
Technology Industry Association uniting the world's top IT firms, underscored
that global cyber security starts at home with the average Internet user.
"The weakest link in cyber space is the human being behind the computer
with not enough awareness and skills on IT security matters," Kramer told the
forum.

29

Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, an IT expert with Estonia's defence ministry, repeated the
warning.
"People everywhere need to understand that your unprotected computer at
home can be used as a tool in cyber-war," she said.
Tim Boerner, an IT security expert with the US Secret Service, said experts
noted increased attacks on Georgian web sites weeks before the first bombs
fell on Georgia.
"Over one million computers worldwide were used during the cyber attacks
against Estonia in spring 2007," he added.
An ex-Soviet republic that broke free from Moscow in 1991, the tiny Baltic Sea
state of Estonia joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.
It has become a leader in global IT development and has focused heavily on
cyber security since suffering the wave of cyber attacks in early 2007.

Russian Hacker Forums Fueled Georgia Cyber Attacks
An exhaustive inquiry into August's cyber attacks on the former Soviet bloc
nation of Georgia finds no smoking gun in the hands of the Russian
government. But experts say evidence suggests that Russian officials did little
to discourage the online assault, which was coordinated through a Russian
online forum that appeared to have been prepped with target lists and
details about Georgian Web site vulnerabilities well before the two countries
engaged in a brief but deadly ground, sea and air war.
The findings come from an open source investigation launched byProject
Grey Goose, a volunteer effort by more than 100 security experts from tech
giants like Microsoft and Oracle, as well as former members of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Lexis-Nexis, theDepartment of Homeland Security and
defense contractor SAIC, among others.
The group began its inquiry shortly after the cyber war disabled a large
number of Georgia government Web sites. Starting with the Russian hacker
forum Xaker.ru (hacker.ru), investigators found a posting encouraging wouldbe cyber militia members to enlist at a private, password-protected online
forum called StopGeorgia.ru. Grey Goose principal investigator Jeff Carr said
the administrators of the hacker forum were keenly aware that American
cyber sleuths were poking around: Within hours after discovering the link to
the StopGeorgia site, Xaker.ru administrators deleted the link and banned all
access from U.S.-based Internet addresses.

30

At StopGeorgia.ru, project members unearthed a top-down hierarchy of
expert hackers who doled out target lists of Georgian government Web sites
to relative novices, complete with instructions on how to exploit vulnerabilities
in the sites in order to render them inaccessible. Following a July defacement
of the Georgian president's Web site that was blamed on Russian hackers, the
Georgian government blocked Russian Internet users from visiting
government Web sites.
But Carr said StopGeorgia administrators also equipped recruits with
directions on evading those digital roadblocks, by routing their attacks
through Internet addresses in other Eastern European nations. The level of
advance preparation and reconnaissance strongly suggests that Russian
hackers were primed for the assault by officials within the Russian government
and or military, Carr said.
"The fact that the StopGeorgia.ru site was up and running within hours of the
ground assault -- with full target lists already vetted and with a large member
population -- was evidence that this effort did not just spring up out of
nowhere," said Carr, speaking at a forum in Tysons Corner, Va., sponsored
by Palantir Technologies, an In-Q-Tel funded company in Palo Alto, Calif.,
whose data analysis software helped Grey Goose investigators track the
origins and foot soldiers involved in the cyber attack. "If they were planning
ahead of the invasion, how did they know the invasion was going to occur?
The only way they could have known that is if they were told."
Initially, security experts assumed that the sites were felled via "distributed
denial of service" (DDoS) attacks, a well-known method of assault that uses
hundreds or thousands of compromised personal computers to flood a
targeted site with so much junk traffic that it can no longer accommodate
legitimate visitors. But investigators soon learned that attackers were
instructed in the ways of a far more simple but equally effective attack
strategy capable of throttling a targeted Web site using a single computer.
Security researcher and Grey Goose investigator Billy Rios said attackers
disabled the sites using a built-in feature of MySQL, a software suite widely
used by Web sites to manage back-end databases. The "benchmark" feature
in MySQL allows site administrators to test the efficiency of database queries,
but last year hackers posted online instructions for exploiting the benchmark
feature to inject millions of junk queries into a targeted database, such that
the Web servers behind the site become so tied up with bogus instructions
that they effectively cease to function.
"Not only can a small number of users bring down the back end databases, it
indicates that there was some form of planning, reconnaissance, and some
technical sophistication by some of the members," Rios said. "It also indicates
that all the information from the attacked systems was most likely already
compromised and pilfered before the injection point was posted."
While Grey Goose members could find no direct link between Russian
government officials and the StopGeorgia.ru forum administrators, they claim
it is unreasonable to conclude that no such connection exists.

31

"The historical record shows clear support by members of the Russian
government and implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hacker
attacks," the report states, naming at least three Russian politicians and
military officials who have previously endorsed coordinated cyber attacks
against other nations as a show of nationalistic pride.
Oleg Gordievsky, a former colonel in the Russian KGB who defected to the
British intelligence wing MI6 in 1985, spoke in 1998 at an international
conference on crime and discussed how Russian hackers convicted of cyber
crime are sometimes offered an alternative to prison -- working for the FSB"
(the federal security service of the Russian Federation and a successor to the
KGB).
According to a cyber warfare analysis by researchers at Dartmouth College,
Moscow has a track record of offensive hacking into Chechen Web sites. The
researchers provide this account of incidents in 2002, when Russian hackers
used cyber warfare in to supplement the ongoing military conflict with
Chechnya.
"In 2002, Chechen rebels claimed that two of their Web sites, kavkaz.org and
chechenpress.com, crashed under hack attacks by the Russian FSB security
service. The website crashes were reportedly timed to occur concurrently or
shortly after Russian Special Forces troops stormed the Moscow Theater in
which the rebels had taken hostages. "On October 26 ... our Web Site
kavkaz.org was attacked by a group of hackers," said a spokesman for the
Chechen rebel site run by Movladi Udugov. Following the attack on the site,
which is based in the United States, Udugov said that he was "amazed Russia's
special services can operate so freely on U.S. territory." The attacks on one
site, chechenpress.com, fell under the category of brute-force denial of
service (DoS) attacks, while on the other site, kavkaz.org, the attacks
appeared much more sophisticated.
According to Chechen sources, the Web site was hijacked by hackers from
the FSB. The FSB hackers reportedly accomplished this by changing the
domain registration of the site and then eliminating the data for the site from
the hosting server. Upon learning of these attacks, the rebels moved the
information on the sites to kavkazcenter.com. However, that site was
attacked just a week later, also apparently the work of FSB hackers.

In July, Russian hackers were blamed for a similar assault on Lithuanian
government Web sites. In Security Fix's account of that attack, I posted a
copy of a congratulatory letter sent to nationalist Russian hackers by Nikolai
Kuryanovich, a former member of the Russian Duma. The missive is dated
March 2006, and addresses the hacker group Slavic Union after the group
had just completed a series of successful attacks against Israeli Web sites.
"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of
battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information
soldiers, that is hackers," Kuryanovich wrote. "This means that a small force of

hackers is stronger than the multi-thousand force of the current armed
forces."
The Grey Goose report concludes that the journeyman-apprentice
relationship observed in the StopGeorgia forum will continue to be the
training model used by nationalistic Russian hackers, and that those hackers
are actively engaged in finding more efficient ways to disable networks.
In the meantime, Carr said, the Russian government will continue to deny any
involvement in any nation-level cyber attacks.
"The Russian government has adopted this hands-off and satisfying position of
deniability while enjoying the rewards achieved by the Russian hacker
community," Carr said.
