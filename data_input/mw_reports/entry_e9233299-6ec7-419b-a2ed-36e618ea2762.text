Sakula Reloaded
THE ADVERSARY LINE-UP

18 NOV 2015

MATT DAHL

Often during the investigation of sophisticated threat actors, the demarcation between the
different attackers and campaigns are blurry. Researchers need to rely on tradecraft and analytic
rigor to understand the unseen components of the attack, this often necessitates an intelligence
assessment. The use of an intelligence assessment around a set of activity introduces room for
error, which is generally balanced with conﬁdences and likelihoods. A window into the mind of the
analyst making these assessments and the difﬁculty imposed by the ambiguity of looking at the
fragments of an attack can be glimpsed through the case of the malware dubbed Sakula.

Sakula is a well known malware variant linked to several signiﬁcant targeted intrusion campaigns
over the past 2-3 years. This remote access toolkit has been publicly examined multiple times by
the threat intelligence community. CrowdStrike has released two blog posts detailing Sakula
campaigns and continues to investigate its usage. In the past two years, two campaigns of
Sakula activity stand out as being particularly signiﬁcant – the “French Aerospace” Campaign and
the “Ironman” Campaign. In recent months, CrowdStrike has observed limited use of what
appears to be a third Sakula variant.

Investigation into the use of Sakula malware leads the CrowdStrike analyst to assess that there is
no deﬁnitive connection between these three campaigns. Further the analyst assesses that
Sakula is a limited-release tool in use by multiple adversaries. An interesting facet of this
malware to highlight, is the apparent connection between the use of Sakula and PlugX. In one
case detailed below, Sakula was directly observed as a ﬁrst stage used to deliver a second stage
PlugX payload, and in another case there is evidence that Sakula and PlugX samples have relied
on the same command and control (C2) infrastructure. What follows is a brief discussion of a
recent Sakula campaign and a summary of previously observed Sakula activity.

The INOCNATION Campaign

In early July, CrowdStrike’s Falcon Host technology detected an attack leveraging the CVE-20155119 exploit code that was publicly exposed after the breach of the European information security
company Hacking Team. The exploit was hosted at www[.]cbppnews[.]com/movie.swf, which
CrowdStrike speculates was meant to spoof the website of the US-based think tank “Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities”. Upon successful exploitation, a ﬁle was saved at
“%Temp%/Rdws.exe” which is executed and writes another ﬁle at “%TEMP%/adobe.dat.” This ﬁle
was used as a ﬁrst stage downloader to retrieve a second stage PlugX ﬁle that connected to
several C2 domains beginning with cdn[.]sanecat[.]com. Analysis of this ﬁrst stage downloader
revealed it to be a new variant of Sakula malware.

About a month later, in early August 2015, Falcon Host detected similar suspicious activity. The
investigation of this activity identiﬁed malware included in a fake installer alleging to be a security
plugin customized to the target organization. This attack was assessed to be part of highly
tailored phishing campaign, which utilized a registered domain purporting to be owned by the
target organization’s security team. Once activated, the malware beaconed to port 443 on the
same domain used to send the initial phishing email.

Finally, a few weeks after the second incident, CrowdStrike identiﬁed another sample of the new
Sakula variant. This new ﬁle masqueraded as an installer for legitimate software and conducted
C2 communications with the domain inocnation[.]com. This domain appears to be meant to spoof
that of a legitimate entity which would indicate the target for this campaign, although it is unclear
at this time exactly which organization this may be. Possible candidates for this targeting include
the Iraq National Oil Company or the Indian National Overseas Congress.

The Ironman Campaign

Before the identiﬁcation of this new variant, CrowdStrike last publicly reported on Sakula in
November 2014. That investigation began in late July 2014 when CrowdStrike identiﬁed an
interesting ﬁle with zero anti-virus detections being used to drop an older variant of the Sakula
malware. The ﬁle was an executable disguised as an installer for Adobe software signed with a
certiﬁcate for the organization DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd. When opened, this ﬁle displayed a spoofed
webpage for an American university alumni event and also dropped a Sakula payload that
communicated with a C2 IP address of 180.210.206.246.

Within days of the discovery of this ﬁle, two other similar Sakula dropper ﬁles were identiﬁed that
were also disguised as installers for legitimate software, redirected victims to sites meant to spoof
the legitimate sites of the target organizations, and were also signed with the DTOPTOOLZ
certiﬁcate. These incidents targeted a US-based defense company and the Mongolian
government.

The use of a fake installers, spoofed domains, and Sakula malware overlaps the tactics,
techniques, and procedures of the Ironman campaign with the activity observed during the
INOCNATION Campaign. A table highlighting notable similarities between the Ironman and
INOCNATION Campaigns follows.

Further research revealed additional Sakula samples signed with the DTOPTOOLZ certiﬁcate
dating back to April 2014 that appeared to be targeted at a healthcare organization and an IT
business serving US government clients. One of these ﬁles communicated with the domain
we11point[.]com domain which appeared to be a spoof of the website for the healthcare
company, WellPoint, which is now known as Anthem. The spoofed domain suggests that the
WellPoint healthcare organization was a target in this campaign, and, in fact, in February 2015,
Anthem announced a massive data breach which is believed to be the result of a compromise by
China-based targeted intrusion actors

The Anthem breach announcement preceded a number of similar notiﬁcations from other
healthcare entities like Premera and CareFirst, and the U.S. government’s Ofﬁce of Personnel
Management. Security researchers investigating this activity found additional indicators
suggesting that the operators carrying out the DTOPTOOLZ Sakula campaign were the same
ones responsible for all of these breaches.

It should be noted that a previous blog post discussed possible connections between the Ironman
Campaign and CrowdStrike’s DEEP PANDA adversary. Further investigation into this campaign
and Sakula activity in general has reduced conﬁdence in this connection and it now appears
unlikely that the two are linked.

The French Aerospace Campaign

CrowdStrike’s ﬁrst public report on Sakula activity came in February 2014, as a result of strategic
web compromise (SWC) activity affecting French aerospace-related websites. The SWC
leveraged what was, at the time, zero-day exploit code for the CVE-2014-0322 vulnerability. The
payload ultimately delivered in these attacks was Sakula connecting to a command and control
(C2) domain of oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.

Some of the general Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of this operation were shared
with a 2012 SWC attack using the website of US-based turbine manufacturer Capstone Turbine
to host a zero-day exploit. The tactical similarities include the use of SWC sites to infect victims,
the use of exploit code for zero-day vulnerabilities, and overlaps in the infrastructure used.
Speciﬁcally, the known Sakula C2 domain webmail[.]vipreclod[.]com has shared infrastructure

with the Capstone Turbine-themed domain capstone[.]homeftp[.]net, suggesting that the same
operators conducting the Capstone Turbine activity also used Sakula. This infrastructure has also
been leveraged as C2 for PlugX samples. Furthermore, the Capstone Turbine-related
infrastructure also includes multiple domains referencing “GIFAS” which is the acronym for the
French Aerospace Industries Association (Groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques
et spatiales). GIFAS-themed domains were also used in the February 2014 SWC activity.

Conclusion

The Sakula malware demonstrates the difﬁculty of attribution and the rationale for bookending
technical information with analytic judgements. Sakula has relatively restricted deployments when
compared to more widespread RATs used by China-based adversaries such as PlugX. Its use is
linked to the use of a number of zero-day exploits and high-proﬁle incidents such as those
resulting in the healthcare and government data breach notiﬁcations earlier this year. While its
use is relatively limited, prolonged monitoring of Sakula activity leads the CrowdStrike Intelligence
team to assess that it is likely used by a small subset of operators, which, given the access to
zero-day exploits and high-proﬁle operations, are likely well-resourced.
