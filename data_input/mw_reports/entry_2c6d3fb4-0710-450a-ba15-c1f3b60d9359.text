Another one for the collection - Mespinoza (Pysa)

Sat 14 December 2019 in Ransomware
Back in October of 2019 the Mespinoza Ransomware family first surfaced via Malspam. On
the 14th of December it returned with a new extension .pysa so let's see if any changes have
been made.
Fun Fact: The Extension "pysa" is probably derived from the Zanzibari Coin with the same
name. Apparently it's quite popular with collectors. But enough of the pocket change, so let
me put my two cents in on this sample :D

A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below
will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check
with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending
on where you live.

As always: Running Detect it easy on the executable:

One of the first things it will do is modify the
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System Registry Key to set

the following values. Unfortunately I couldn't confirm this action in a sandbox with RegShot
yet.

To retain basic functions of the Operating System Mespinoza will spare certain directories
related directly to Windows and critical files.

It will also specifically look for SQL related processes. I will have to confirm this with a
debugger, but most of the time database processes are killed by Ransomware to disrupt the
service and make the files available for encryption.

Of course Mespinoza won't stop with the system drive so it will check for connected
removable media or shared network drives. GetDriveTypeW will tell it which type of media
the selected device belongs to.

Up until now I have not seen a ransomware sample running verclsid.exe, so let's investigate:
{0B2C9183-C9FA-4C53-AE21-C900B0C39965} corresponds to
C:\Windows\system32\SearchFolder.dll and {0C733A8A-2A1C-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D}
matches the CLSID of IDBProperties which is part of the Microsoft SQL Server.
C:\Windows\system32\verclsid.exe" /S /C {0B2C9183-C9FA-4C53-AE21-C900B0C39965} /I
{0C733A8A-2A1C-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D} /X 0x401

After looking at a string dump I found this hex string which is probably the key blob. I'll try to
verify this with x32dbg later.
30820220300D06092A864886F70D01010105000382020D003082020802820201009CC3A0141B5488CD31B7

Turns out that the encrypted key is appended to the end of each file affected by the
ransomware (which is a common tactic for some strains).

As this article is work in progress I will update it as soon as I can. As I did not see the
Malware deleting the Volume Shadow Copies until now, so one option for possible victims
would be to run Photorec or Recuva to check for recoverable files.

Update 22.01.2020:
There's a new version of the Mespinoza / .pysa Variant compiled on the 18th of JaÅ„uary:
Mespinoza (.pysa) @ AnyRun --> `sha256
e9662b468135f758a9487a1be50159ef57f3050b753de2915763b4ed78839ead

In the screenshot below you can see a comparison of the old sample (1.exe) and the new
one (1.bin). Exept for a few minor changes the two samples are mostly identical:

The public Key used by the criminals is still the same (converted from hex to raw, key blob
located in the binary):
