Description
A JavaScript and VBScript shellcode launcher. This will spawn a 32 bit version of the binary
specified and inject shellcode into it.
DotNetToJScript can be found here: https://github.com/tyranid/DotNetToJScript

Usage:
Choose a binary you want to inject into, default "rundll32.exe", you can use
notepad.exe, calc.exe for example...
Generate a 32 bit raw shellcode in whatever framework you want. Tested: Cobalt
Strike, Metasploit Framework
Run: cat payload.bin | base64 -w 0
For JavaScript: Copy the base64 encoded payload into the code variable below
var code = "<base64 encoded 32 bit raw shellcode>";

For VBScript: Copy the base64 encoded payload into the code variable below
Dim code: code = "<base64 encoded 32 bit raw shellcode>"

Then run:
wscript.exe CACTUSTORCH.js or wscript.exe CACTUSTORCH.vbs via command line on

the target, or double click on the files within Explorer.
For VBA: Copy the base64 encoded payload into a file such as code.txt
Run python splitvba.py code.txt output.txt
Copy output.txt under the following bit so it looks like:
code = ""
code = code & "<base64 code in 100 byte chunk"
code = code & "<base64 code in 100 byte chunk"

Copy and paste the whole payload into Word Macro
Save Word Doc and send off or run it.

CobaltStrike
Load CACTUSTORCH.cna
Go to Attack -> Host CACTUSTORCH Payload
