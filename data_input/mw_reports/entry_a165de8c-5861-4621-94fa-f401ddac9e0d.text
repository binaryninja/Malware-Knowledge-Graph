Over the past two decades, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has capitalized on the
global connectivity of the internet age in ways no other nation has. Once regarded as a
“second-tier” cyber power, China has aggressively and consistently built its national cyber
program to the point where it is now considered one of the world’s preeminent cyber players.
A recent study ranked China as a “Most Comprehensive Cyber Power,” second only to the
United States. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used a multi-pronged strategy to
achieve this remarkable ascent, prioritizing computer science and technology education
within China and creating a pipeline of talent for cyber military operations.
On July 19, 2021, the U.S. government and its allies — including the EU, the Five Eyes
countries, and NATO — publicly condemned and blamed the PRC for a series of malicious
cyberattacks, including the Microsoft Exchange Hacks, global ransomware attacks, and
cyberattacks against medical research institutes and universities.
Along with this, the U.S. Department of Justice released an indictment in May (unsealed July
16th) that charged four Chinese nationals with a campaign to hack into the computer
systems of dozens of companies, universities, and governmental entities around the world
from 2011 to 2018. The nationals are believed to be members of the group tracked as
APT40, which is connected to the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) Hainan State
Security Department (HSSD). The indictment alleges that China has been leading a
worldwide hacking and economic espionage campaign, using cyberattacks to steal
intellectual property in disregard of bilateral and multilateral agreements.

China targets Taiwanese finance institutions
TLDR: In early February, Symantec released a report detailing a persistent campaign by the
Chinese state-sponsored APT Antlion, targeting Taiwanese financial institutions for at least
18 months. In the attacks, the threat actors deployed a backdoor dubbed xPack to maintain
extensive access to victim systems, and the primary goal of the campaign is deemed to be
espionage as researchers observed the threat actors exfiltrating data from infected
networks.
More information: What is notable about the campaign is the extremely long dwell time of
many of the compromises that allowed the threat actors ample time for reconnaissance and
exfiltration without detection. For example, in one of the undisclosed financial institution’s
networks, the threat actors spent almost 250 days undetected in the network between
December 2020 and August 2021, and spent over 175 days in another victim’s network
undetected. The initial access vector is reportedly unclear, but researchers believe Antlion
exploited a web application flaw to establish a foothold and drop xPack, which is then used
to execute system commands, drop additional executables, and stage data for exfiltration.
The last activity seen in the campaign was August 2021.

APT15 Campaign Targeting Entities in Over 29 Countries

3/20

Microsoft has observed APT15 targeting governments, diplomatic entities, and NGOs in over
29 countries across Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America.
Since September 2019, APT15 has conducted activity across several countries, with a large
amount of activity targeting Central and South American governments. Using exploits against
unpatched systems to compromise remote access services and applications, APT15
leverages credential dumpers or stealers upon intrusion to obtain legitimate credentials,
which they use to gain access to victim accounts. APT15 threat actors developed and
deployed custom malware that enabled them to maintain persistence on victim networks
over extended periods of time. This has allowed it to achieve long-term access to multiple
targets, which it uses to perform frequent and scheduled data collection and exfiltration. In
the wake of discovering this campaign, Microsoft successfully obtained a court warrant that
allowed it to seize 42 domains used by APT15 in the operations.

HAFNIUM Abuse of Log4Shell
Microsoft reports HAFNIUM is exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability to attack virtualization
infrastructure in order to extend their usual targeting.
In these attacks, Microsoft observed HAFNIUM-associated systems leveraging a DNS
service typically associated with testing activity to fingerprint systems.

Geopolitical
Twitter shuts down thousands of state-linked accounts in China that seek to counter
evidence of human rights abuses in Xinjiang
In early December, the U.S. announces a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter
Olympics in Beijing, citing “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”
China and Japan agree to set up a joint communication hotline by the end of 2022
amid tensions over Taiwan and issues in the East and South China seas.
In mid-December, U.S. Congress passes a bill called The Uyghur Forced Labor
Prevention Act that requires companies to prove that goods imported from China's
Xinjiang region were not produced with forced labour.

4/20

Around the same time Congress passes The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the
U.S. imposes trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and
entities over human rights violations and the alleged development of biotechnology to
support Chinese military end uses and end users, to include purported brain-control
weaponry.
The U.S. department of commerce states China "is choosing to use these
technologies to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of
ethnic and religious minority groups."
U.S. intelligence agencies state Saudi Arabia is now actively manufacturing its own
ballistic missiles with the help of China.
The U.S. is now concerned about whether Saudi's ballistic missile advancements
could change regional power dynamics and complicate efforts to discuss the
nuclear deal with Iran.

TAG-28 attacks on Indian entities
As the bilateral relations between China and India continue to deteriorate over the Line of
Actual Control (LAC) dispute in the Galwan Valley, India has become the target of several
Chinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. Researchers at Recorded Future [PDF] have
identified intrusions targeting Indian entities led by suspected Chinese state-sponsored
threat activity group TAG-28. The victims of these intrusions include Indian media
conglomerate Bennett Coleman And Co Ltd (BCCL), a multimillion-dollar news organization
commonly known as “The Times Group” that consistently reports on the China-India war. It
also includes the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which contains the
biometric data of one billion Indian citizens, as well as the Madhya Pradesh Police
Department (MPP), whose Chief Minister was critical of China after the border clashes that
occurred in the Ladakh region in June 2020.
In this campaign, TAG-28 used Winnti malware, which is a family of malware that several
Chinese threat actors have historically used. In relation to the attack on BCCL, between
February and August 2021, four IPs were seen communicating with two Winnti C2 Servers
and possibly a Cobalt Strike server, which led to approximately 500 MB of data being
exfiltrated from the network. From June 10 to at least July 20, 2021, researchers observed
two IPs registered to UIDAI communicating with the same suspected Cobalt Strike C2 server
used to target BCCL. Less than 10 MB was egressed from the UIDAI network with an
ingress of almost 30 MB, potentially indicating the deployment of additional malicious tooling
from the TAG-28 infrastructure. For the targeting of the MPP, the department’s website
began communicating with a Winnti C2 server on June 1, 2021. Another MPP IP began
talking to the malicious server on July 7 to at least August 9, with around 5MB of data being
transferred.

Chinese APTs infiltrate major Afghan telecom provider
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has detected separate intrusion activity linked to 4 distinct
Chinese state-sponsored threat actors targeting a mail server of Roshan, one of
Afghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers. The APTs are RedFoxtrot and Calypso
APT, and there are 2 additional clusters using the Winnti and PlugX backdoors that haven’t
been linked to groups yet. Data exfiltration activity for these intrusions, particularly the
Calypso APT activity and the unknown threat actor using the Winnti malware, spiked
throughout August and September 2021, which coincided with major geopolitical events like
the withdrawal of US troops and the Taliban takeover.
It’s not clear from the latest research how the Roshan server was infected, but Chinese APT
attacks often begin by exploiting external-facing services or spearfishing campaigns. Roshan
offers a hugely valuable platform for strategic intelligence collection, allowing for things like
the monitoring of downstream targets, bulk collection of communication data, as well as the
ability to track and monitor individual targets. The Chinese government also considers the
telecom sector to be of strategic significance in countries participating in the Belt and Road
Initiative. So there are many motives here.

Chinese espionage group targets critical infrastructure orgs in Southeast
Asia
A Chinese cyber-espionage group has been identified targeting at least four critical
infrastructure organizations in a southeast Asian country from November 2020 to March
2021. Organizations targeted include a water company, a power company, a communications
company, and a defense organization, and researchers said they found evidence that the
attackers were interested in targeting information about SCADA systems.There is evidence
that the attacker behind this campaign is based in China, but there is not enough information
available to attribute the activity to a known actor. The threat actors made extensive use of
living-off-the-land / dual-use tools, including Windows Management Instrumentation,
ProcDump, PsExec, and Mimikatz. Espionage seems like the likeliest motive of these
attacks, indicated by the activities of credential stealing, lateral movement, and keylogger
deployment as well as the types of machines targeted in some of the organizations - most of
which were involved in design and engineering. An attacker gaining access to multiple critical
infrastructure organizations in the same country could potentially give them access to a vast
amount of sensitive information.

DeadRinger Campaign
Security researchers identified three distinct clusters of malicious activities operating on
behalf of Chinese state interests, namely Gallium, APT 30/Naikon, and APT27 / Emissary
Panda, in a campaign dubbed “DeadRinger.” In this campaign, the groups staged a series of
attacks that targeted networks belonging to at least five major telecommunications
companies located in Southeast Asia from 2017 to at least mid-2021. Researchers assess
6/20

that the goal behind these intrusions was to gain and maintain continuous access to
telecommunication providers and to facilitate cyber espionage against select targets. In this
campaign, there are three observed clusters of activity conducted over various time periods
and deploying different malware. Overall, there has been an interesting overlap between
these clusters: they were all observed in the same target environment, around the same
timeframe, and even on the same endpoints. Overlaps in attacker TTPs across the clusters
are evidence of a likely connection between the threat actors, and it is assumed that each
group was tasked with parallel objectives in monitoring the communications of specific highvalue targets under the direction of a single Chinese body.

SparklingGoblin
ESET researchers recently discovered a new undocumented modular backdoor called
Sidewalk, which has been linked to a new APT they are calling SparklingGoblin.
SparklingGoblin was first detected in May 2020 by researchers tracking the Winnti group,
aka APT41. Even though this campaign exhibited links to Winnti Group, the modus operandi
was quite different, leading researchers to start tracking it as a separate threat actor. The
new undocumented modular backdoor, Sidewalk, was used during SparklingGoblin’s recent
campaign targeting a computer retail company in the US. Sidewalk is a backdoor that
dynamically loads additional modules sent from its C2 server, uses a Google Docs document
as a dead drop resolver, and uses Cloudflare workers web services as a C2 server.
SideWalk can collect information about running processes, write received data to file, and
call plugins received from the C2 server. SparklingGoblin has been very active from mid2020 to now and has targeted organizations mostly in East and Southeast Asia, but has
targeted a broad range of entities around the world including in the USA.

UNC 215 cyber espionage campaign in Israel
A cyber-espionage group based out of China called UNC215 has been identified conducting
a campaign against Israeli government entities, IT providers, and telecommunications
companies since January 2019. UNC215 is linked with low confidence to APT27 and is said
to target organizations that are of great interest to Beijing's financial, diplomatic, and strategic
objectives, demonstrating China's consistent strategic interest in the Middle East related to
the Belt and Road Initiative and interest in Israel’s robust technology sector. UNC215 has a
high level of operational security: it makes a consistent effort to delete tools and any forensic
artifacts from compromised systems; uses other victim networks to proxy its C2 instructions
in order to evade detection and blend in with normal network traffic; and incorporates false
flags. For example, on at least three occasions, UNC215 employed a custom tool leaked
from Iranian actors in order to deceive analysts and make it look like Iranian actors were
behind the attacks.

HAFNIUM attacks on Microsoft Exchange servers

7/20

Dominating the headlines of Chinese cyber attacks is the on-premise Microsoft Exchange
server attack, presumed to be carried out by the Chinese APT HAFNIUM. This group has
been identified as exploiting Exchange servers through a collection of several zero-day
vulnerabilities. The supposed motive behind this attack aligns with the typical strategy of
Chinese cyber attacks: intellectual property theft. The four vulnerabilities affect unpatched
on-premise Microsoft Exchange servers - versions 2013 to 2019, excluding only Exchange
Online (Office365). You can read detailed IronNet analysis and response in our blog
"HAFNIUM Targets Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Vulnerabilities."

LuminousMoth
A Chinese APT, dubbed LuminousMoth by Kaspersky, was discovered spreading fake Zoom
software to spy on targets in South East Asia since at least October 2020. The earliest
sightings of this currently ongoing campaign were in Myanmar, but the attackers now appear
much more active in the Philippines and have an interest in targeting government entities.
With activities and tactics appearing to overlap with that of Mustang Panda, LuminousMoth
uses two infection vectors in these attacks. The first provides initial access to a system
through a spearphishing email containing a DropBox download link. The second infection
vector comes after the first has succeeded, in which the malware attempts to spread by
infecting removable USB drives. The attackers deploy a post-exploitation tool that
impersonates Zoom software with a valid digital signature, using it to scan compromised
systems for files with pre-defined extensions that are then copied and transferred to a C2
server. On some compromised systems, the attackers also deployed another postexploitation tool that steals cookies from a Chrome browser for the purpose of hijacking and
impersonating the Gmail sessions of the targets. It is clear that the attacks of this campaign
are very large-scale and affect a wide range of targets with the ultimate goal of compromising
a few that are of particular interest.

Tag-22
In July 2021, Recorded Future identified a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group
tracked as Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22) targeting telecommunications, academia, R&D,
and government organizations in Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The group
was first detected in September 2020 targeting a Hong Kong university and airport, but in
June 2021, TAG-22 was identified targeting the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) in Taiwan, Nepal Telecom, and the Department of Information and Communications
Technology in the Philippines. In this most recent campaign, TAG-22 used compromised
GlassFish servers and Cobalt Strike for initial access before pivoting to Winnti, ShadowPad,
and Spyder backdoors for long-term access using actor-controlled C2 infrastructure. Tracked
as an independent activity cluster that overlaps with the wider network defined as Winnti
Group, TAG-22 leverages shared custom backdoors unique to Chinese state-sponsored
groups — including ShadowPad and Winnti — while also using open-source/offensive

8/20

security tools like Cobalt Strike and Acunetix. The group’s continued use of publicly reported
infrastructure indicates that it is experiencing a high degree of operational success despite a
range of public reporting regarding its operations.

IndigoZebra
A Chinese APT group dubbed “IndigoZebra” has been identified conducting an ongoing
spearphishing campaign against the Afghan government, impersonating the Afghan
president as a lure to infiltrate government agencies, leading to the compromise of the
Afghan National Security Council (NSC). IndigoZebra has been observed targeting other
Central Asian countries as well, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, since at least 2014.
In IndigoZebra’s infection chain used in its attacks against the Afghan government, the threat
actors begin with an email containing a malicious password-protected RAR archive (NSC
Press conference.rar), which thwarts some sandbox solutions because it requires user
interaction. The RAR archive drops the extracted file (NSC Press conference.exe), which
then drops and executes the BoxCaon backdoor (spools.exe). The BoxCaon backdoor,
which is a variant of the xCaon malware family, uses Dropbox as a command-and-control
(C2) server, sending and receiving commands contained in a specific folder in an attackercreated Dropbox account. The threat actors’ use of Dropbox for C2 communications aids in
masking the malicious traffic in the victim’s network and appears as benign activity in user
environments where Dropbox is used (Dropbox comes default on some Windows
computers). The backdoor uses a hardcoded access token and has the ability to download,
upload, and execute files. Other malware that the group has used in 2020-2021 (primarily
against political entities in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) are hosted on ASN 20473 (CHOOPA)
and Vultr - a subsidiary of CHOOPA that is commonly used for malicious purposes by
criminals and Chinese APTs.

Linux attacks / RedXOR
In most recent news, a new sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers
was discovered by security researchers at Intezer in early March, and TTPs indicate it is the
work of high-profile Chinese threat actors. Dubbed RedXOR, the backdoor masquerades as
a polkit daemon (which is a toolkit used for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate
with privileged processes), and it is very similar to malware associated with the Winnti
Umbrella — a term used to describe a collective of state-backed hacking groups linked to
Chinese government interests. The operation is still believed to be ongoing as researchers
experienced an “on and off” availability of the C2 server, indicating that the operation is still
active. The malware samples were first uploaded from Indonesia and Taiwan— two countries
known to be heavily targeted by Chinese APTs. The samples were compiled with a legacy
GCC compiler on an old version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, indicating that RedXOR is
used in targeted attacks against legacy Linux systems. It is packaged with the usual suite of
tools, including the ability to gather system information, perform file operations, run arbitrary
shell commands, and even options to remotely update the malware.
9/20

Of note: Victim types and motivations have not been indicated in reports, but the groups that
fall under the Winnti Umbrella share an arsenal of malicious tools used in cyber espionage
and financially motivated attacks and it has been stated that there has been a large increase
in unique Linux malware tools tailored for espionage operations.

Additional China cyber attack threat campaigns
To summarize the threat at a more tactical level, the following sections highlight several of
the most recent and notable Chinese state-sponsored campaigns uncovered by
cybersecurity researchers. Each section identifies a sample of the countries and sectors
targeted by a given group, and the behaviors or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
utilized to succeed in their objectives. Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed,
reading.

APT31
Overview:
APT31 is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage group focused primarily on acquiring
information that can provide political, economic, and military advantages to the Chinese
government and state-owned enterprises. Active since at least 2013, APT31 conducts mainly
intellectual property theft and espionage operations using a range of tools and techniques to
infect target systems, steal credentials, and move laterally within a compromised network.
APT31 targets numerous organizations in various sectors, often seeking intellectual property,
information that provides a commercial advantage, or sensitive details about government
and defense targets of interest.
Recent Activity:
Security researchers uncovered approximately 10 attacks carried out from January to July
2021 by APT31, in which the group used a new dropper and targeted entities in the U.S.,
Canada, Mongolia, Belarus, and Russia. APT31, also known as Judgement Panda and
Zirconium, has been active since at least 2016 and is known to provide data to the Chinese
government and enterprises for political, economic, and military advantages. PT Security
was able to link these attacks and the new dropper to APT31 because numerous overlaps
were found between these malware instances and APT31’s DropboxAES RAT trojan in
relation to functionality, techniques, and mechanisms used.
On July 21st, the French national cyber-security agency (CERT-FR) warned of an ongoing
campaign by Chinese-backed APT31 against a large number of French organizations.
CERT-FR investigations show that in these attacks, APT31 compromises routers to leverage
them as anonymization relays before carrying out reconnaissance and attack activities. In
other words, APT31 uses a network of compromised home routers as operational relay

10/20

boxes to gather information and carry out further malicious actions. CERT-FR shared a list of
IOCs to help entities assess potential compromises, and more information about the extent
of these attacks will likely be made public by French authorities in the near future.
In February 2021, it was reported that APT31 cloned and used a Windows-hacking tool,
code-named EpMe, that was originally created by the Equation Group — an APT with links
to various branches of the NSA. Essentially, APT31 extracted the core functionality of the
tool and created its own replication, known as “Jian” or “double-edged sword,” around the
exploits included in EpMe. What is concerning (and remarkable) about this reconstructed
EpMe tool is that evidence points to the exploit first being used in 2014 — almost three years
before it became publicly available with the Shadow Brokers dump and was patched by
Microsoft.
Jian was first discovered on a U.S.-based network by security researchers at Lockheed
Martin, indicating that the tool has largely been used against U.S. targets. Evidence points to
the notion that APT31 managed to access both the 32-bit and 64-bit samples of the EpMe
Equation Group exploit and replicate them to construct Jian, then using the new version of
the exploit alongside their unique multi-staged packer. However, Jian is much less
sophisticated than EpMe and it contains many quirks — like support for Windows 2000 even
though Windows 2000 was never vulnerable to exploit — indicating that they did not really
understand the true nature of the exploited vulnerability and its associated limitations.
The Finnish government officially accused APT31 of hacking into the Finnish parliament in
2020, describing the attack as “aggravated espionage” and “message interception” in order
to further Chinese interests. The attack, which led to the compromise of some parliament
email accounts, is currently being investigated by the Finnish National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI). The threat group has also been accused of targeting the Joe Biden
presidential campaign with malicious spearphishing emails that impersonated anti-virus
software company McAfee and used legitimate services, like DropBox, in an attempt to steal
staffers’ credentials and infect them with malware.
Known
Targets

Numerous sectors, including legal and consulting, telecommunications, software
development, construction and engineering, and aerospace and defense as well

BlackTech
Overview:
BlackTech is a threat group known primarily for conducting cyber espionage operations
against targets in East Asia, with a focus on Taiwan and Japan. The group has likely been
active for a number of years and is responsible for several separate campaigns leveraging
overlapping infrastructure. BlackTech often abuses legitimate software tools and processes
to achieve its goals, using stolen digital certificates and API hooking among other
techniques.
Recent Activity:
Recent reporting confirms that BlackTech remains active and has continued to develop new
custom malware. Researchers at Symantec, who track this group as Palmerworm, noted
BlackTech activity throughout 2019 and 2020 with the group leveraging new strains of
malware to target multiple sectors in Taiwan, Japan, and China.
To date, no private sector cybersecurity companies have publicly attributed activity to
BlackTech. However, in August of 2020, the Taiwanese government asserted that the group
was working on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and had been involved in cyber
operations targeting multiple Taiwanese government and commercial entities.

APT 41 / Winnti
Overview:
APT41 represents one of the most prolific Chinese state-sponsored threats. Incarnations of
APT41 began to appear in the early 2010s, and the group is believed to have been behind
intrusions into a wide variety of sectors, including the healthcare, pharmaceutical,
telecommunications, and video game industries, with victims on nearly every continent. Over
the years, the group has leveraged a variety of custom malware, including a Trojan that
came to be known as Winnti.
The group is probably best known for a series of software supply chain attacks where the
threat actors obtain access to software provider systems and inject malicious code into the
victim’s legitimate software, often managing to distribute the poisoned software through the
victim’s established channels. Such attacks are especially challenging to detect and mitigate
from a consumer perspective, as end users and system administrators invariably trust
software that has been downloaded directly from the publisher. Notably, some of the
individuals comprising APT41 appear to have engaged in not just state-sponsored
espionage, but have also dabbled in operations designed to reap personal financial gain.
There is notable overlap and a significant lack of clarity within the commercial cybersecurity
community on precisely which groups are behind the many intrusions that have been lumped
together under the Winnti umbrella. Some notable software supply chain attacks that have
been potentially linked to the group by various cybersecurity researchers include the
CCleaner, NetSarang, and Asus Live Update compromises. Given the history of software
tool sharing amongst Chinese threat actors and the likelihood that multiple state-sponsored
actors are targeting similar sets of victims, it becomes quite difficult to parse exactly which
group may be behind a given intrusion, especially given the limited visibility that any one
victim or vendor may have. In any case, the overarching tactics and targets described above
can safely be ascribed to PRC cyber operators, regardless of how specifically each discrete
intrusion can be attributed.
Recent Activity:
13/20

In June 2021, Mandiant discovered a potential APT41 campaign targeting at least four U.S.
state governments in May 2021, in which they used three C2 servers, previously identified
malware, and multiple SQL injection attempts. Researchers suspect the group is targeting
vulnerable internet-accessible servers of U.S. state government entities to gain initial access
for intrusion operations. There is currently an ongoing investigation of these intrusions, so
they have not been able to label a specific motive at this time; however, the direct targeting
of U.S. state government entities is a concerning development given the nature of APT41
campaigns. This perhaps is an attempt to circumvent better prepared and/or resourced
federal agencies and to target state and local government for easier access to the same or
similar material.
It was revealed in June 2021 that APT41 is believed to be responsible for an almost three
month long cyberattack against Air India. Since at least February 23rd, Group-IB observed
an infected device in Air India’s network (“SITASERVER4”) communicating with a C2 server
hosting Cobalt Strike payloads that date back to December 11th, 2020. After this initial
compromise, the APT41 threat actors acquired passwords and achieved persistence to
move laterally into the larger network with the objective of collecting information inside Air
India's local network. Reportedly, at least 20 devices were compromised in the course of this
lateral movement, and the attackers managed to use hashdump and mimikatz to exfiltrate
NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local systems. All in all, APT41 was able to
extract almost 24 MB of information from five devices, taking just over 24 hours to spread
Cobalt Strike beacons to other systems in Air India’s network.
Another large-scale APT41 campaign occurred in early 2020, once again affecting a wide
variety of industries in multiple global regions. The operators appeared to be systemically
leveraging a number of recently identified high severity vulnerabilities, specifically in Cisco
routers, Citrix infrastructure devices, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central, an endpoint
management software tool. Notably, the Citrix and Zoho vulnerabilities were also highlighted
in a recent NSA advisory detailing public technical vulnerabilities known to have been
actively exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also shone a light on APT41 in September of 2020,
unsealing three indictments that brought charges against five Chinese nationals and two
Malaysians for a sweeping series of network intrusions. The DOJ linked the activity to a
Chinese company known as Chengdu 404 Network Technology, which likely operates at the
behest of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. The indictments stated that the hackers
were responsible for intrusions across over 100 victim organizations in numerous countries.
One of the indictments charged the two Malaysian individuals with profiting from information
stolen from video game companies that was provided to them by Chinese actors. Both men
were apprehended by Malaysian authorities. The operators apparently also participated in
ransomware and crypto-jacking attacks, which highlight the type of for-profit criminal
endeavors the group has undertaken apart from their more traditional information gathering
operations.

APT40
Overview:
Likely active since at least 2013, APT40 is a Chinese threat group with a predominant focus
on nations and issues related to the South China Sea, a region the PRC has claimed
territorial sovereignty over despite numerous disputes. The group has repeatedly targeted
shipbuilding, maritime, and engineering entities, as well as government and academic
institutions within multiple countries bordering the South China Sea. The group has
leveraged a variety of malicious software, including publicly available tools such as Cobalt
Strike and custom tools, some of which overlap with other known Chinese groups. Analysis
of data obtained from APT40 infrastructure showed malware administrators accessing the
group’s servers from Hainan, China, which strongly suggests Chinese state sponsorship
when coupled with the group’s targeting patterns.
Recent Activity:
Recent analysis released by Microsoft indicates that APT40 threat actors have on multiple
occasions attempted to use cloud-native services within Azure to conduct malicious C2.
Although the activity was identified and disrupted, the threat actors appear to have
specifically designed malware to abuse proprietary cloud services including the Outlook Task
API, OneDrive API, and Microsoft Graph API.
APT40 was also among the Chinese groups Taiwan publicly accused of targeting multiple
Taiwanese government agencies, alongside BlackTech, Mustang Panda, and other groups.

Mustang Panda
Overview:
Mustang Panda is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group with a history of targeting various
NGOs (non-governmental organizations), minority groups, and political entities within the
Southeast Asian region. The group has also been noted targeting Western think tanks and
NGOs with a nexus to Chinese minority groups. The group has likely been active since at
least 2017.
Mustang Panda frequently relies on phishing lures centered around themes directly relevant
to their targeted victims. These lures use official-looking documents written in the target’s
native language and containing information that would prompt the victim to open the
attached document. These decoy documents frequently contain a .zip archive that executes
a malicious loader when opened. This leads to the installation of the venerable PlugX
malware or a Cobalt Strike Beacon.
Recent Activity:
In the summer of 2020, Recorded Future reported newly identified activity related to Mustang
Panda, which they track as RedDelta. Notably, the group targeted a number of organizations
related to the Catholic Church. The researchers surmised that this activity was likely
connected to the renewal of an agreement between the Vatican and the CCP and was likely
designed to provide insights into the upcoming negotiations (a tactic often used by the
Chinese government in political or business contexts).

Despite the campaign being identified in this way, it appears the threat actors resumed
activity within days of the RedDelta report’s publication. Additional research shows the group
has remained active into Fall 2020 and has updated the malware loader they use to install
their favored PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

TA410
Overview:
In July 2019, several U.S. utility companies were targeted with a well-designed
spearphishing campaign that impersonated a legitimate engineering licensing board to
deliver the LookBack malware. This campaign was attributed to a group tracked as TA410,
who proceeded to conduct a follow-on campaign once again targeting U.S. electric utilities in
August of that year. Later media reports indicated that several smaller, regional public power
utilities were among those targeted and that some were apparently unaware they had been
targeted at all until they were informed by the FBI.
Recent Activity:
Additional analysis later linked the LookBack phishing campaigns to another malware family
dubbed FlowCloud. These two campaigns share a number of tactics, including the
timeframes they were active, the use of malicious attachments contained in phishing emails,
the installation techniques used, and overlapping infrastructure. Like LookBack, the
FlowCloud campaign appears to have targeted victims in the utilities sector using wellcrafted phishing emails impersonating professional organizations within the industry such as
the American Society of Civil Engineers.
Notably, the researchers investigating TA410 identified similarities to the tactics used by
TA429 (also known as APT10: see below). However, it is not fully clear whether the two
groups’ activity is truly related or whether this may have been a deliberate attempt by those

17/20

responsible to plant "false flags" to help hide those behind the campaigns. The attempt to
hide the campaign actors makes sense especially given the widespread media attention
focused on APT10 due to the publication of multiple reports on the group and a related U.S.
indictment of Chinese actors.

APT10
Overview:
APT10 is a prolific and long-standing Chinese state-sponsored threat actor that has been
active since at least 2006. The group’s focus appears to be access enablement, providing
inroads to support commercial and economic espionage against regional and international
competitors including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Like so many
threat groups, APT10 has historically used spearphishing tactics to gain initial footholds on
victim networks. The operators then rely upon a combination of custom and publicly available
hacking tools to move laterally throughout victim networks and establish persistence.
In 2017, details surrounding an APT10 campaign known as Operation Cloud Hopper came to
light. The campaign focused on compromising IT managed service providers (MSPs), which
are businesses that remotely manage IT infrastructure on behalf of their clients.
Compromising these MSPs provided APT10 actors with access to the service providers as
well as their customers. The MSPs’ connections to their customer environments were at
times used by APT10 to exfiltrate data from within customer environments. 2018 indictments
by the U.S. Department of Justice revealed that those behind these campaigns worked for a
company operating at the behest of the Ministry of State Security’s Tianjin State Security
Bureau. Later media reporting revealed just how widespread and successful this strategy
had been, as several major MSPs appear to have been victimized by the group over the
span of several years.
Additional reporting in 2019 asserted that APT10 actors had penetrated at least ten
telecommunications or cellular provider companies across the globe in a campaign dubbed
Operation Soft Cell. During this campaign, APT10 operators appeared to have been
targeting Call Detail Records, which contain metadata regarding individual mobile
18/20

subscribers including information such as device identifiers, locations, and call history. Such
information would be considered highly useful to a foreign intelligence service and fits with
APT10’s history of facilitating access to sensitive datasets.
Recent Activity:
An A41APT campaign, attributed to APT10, is noted to be a sophisticated campaign that
deploys malicious backdoors to exfiltrate information from a number of Japan-linked
companies in different industry sectors across the world. The activity was first detected in
March 2019, carrying out through December 2020, with latest attacks said to have occurred
in January 2021 and JPCERT/CC stating attacks are still ongoing. The campaign includes a
multi-stage attack process, with initial intrusion happening via the exploitation of
vulnerabilities in Pulse Connect Secure, a widely used SSL-VPN, in order to hijack VPN
sessions. In this campaign, APT10 uses previously undocumented malware, most notable of
which is one particular piece of malware called Ecipekac, which is a multi-layer loader
module used to deliver as many as 3 payloads, such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAnti.
IronNet has created TIRs related to this campaign and pushed them to customer
environments.

In addition, published research details continued cyber espionage activity being conducted
by APT10 operators. This latest research provides evidence of yet another large-scale
intrusion campaign targeting multiple global regions and sectors between Fall 2019 and Fall
2020. Most of the victims appear to have a connection to Japanese companies, with the
automotive, pharmaceutical, and engineering sectors among those targeted. The campaign
once again went after MSPs, the group’s most favored target. During the campaign, APT10
was observed using a variety of dual-use and custom malware, extensively using DLL sideloading techniques to execute their malware and exploiting the recently publicized
ZeroLogon vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows systems.

Collective Defense against China cyber attack threats
As evidenced by the numerous examples of Chinese cyber campaigns waged against
commercial, government, and nongovernmental entities around the world, it is clear that
China has made cyber espionage a hallmark of its global strategy. Chinese leadership has
focused massive resources on building out their nation’s cyber capabilities to both secure the
Communist Party’s preeminence within the country and project power beyond its borders.
Organizations working in an immensely broad number of fields have been targeted, ranging
from renewable energy to nanotechnology to human rights. These broad and persistent
targeting patterns are likely to continue the years to come.
Chinese tactics, techniques, and procedures have grown in sophistication as well. Once well
known for executing “smash and grab” operations seeking to simply steal large amounts of
data from their victims as quickly as possible, Chinese threat groups have since evolved. As
the case studies above highlight, Chinese threat actors now seek new and novel ways to
execute their attacks and hide them from network defenders. Innovation and collaboration
have thus become paramount for defenders to identify and prevent such threats.
IronNet’s mission is to provide companies, sectors, and nations with the cutting-edge tools
required to defend against sophisticated threats in cyberspace. The behavioral analytics and
threat intelligence built into our IronDefense platform provide the unique insights required to
detect advanced threat actors, while our IronDome Collective Defense solution allows
organizations to collectively defend against such threats using machine-speed correlation of
data. We believe that technological innovation and collaboration amongst those seeking to
secure cyberspace can ultimately overcome those seeking to divide and exploit it.
