Threat Insights Report
Q1 - 2022

Threat Landscape
Welcome to the Q1 2022 edition of
the HP Wolf Security Threat
Insights Report

Each quarter our security experts highlight notable
malware campaigns, trends and techniques identified by
HP Wolf Security. By isolating threats that have evaded
detection tools and made it to endpoints, HP Wolf
Security gives an insight into the latest techniques being
used by cybercriminals, equipping security teams with
the knowledge to combat emerging threats and improve
their security postures.1

Notable Threats
“Two for one” malware campaign
leads to multiple remote access
Trojan (RAT) infections

At the end of February 2021, the HP threat research team
identified a malware campaign that leads to multiple
RAT infections on the same device. The attackers spread
the malware by email using malicious Visual Basic script
attachments, triggering the infection chain when
opened. Two obfuscated PowerShell commands run,
both of which download and run additional scripts from
the web.

Threats unknown
by hash when
isolated by HP Wolf
Security

The first command downloads an executable (.exe) and a
manifest file. Both files are saved in a folder in the
“ProgramData” directory. The executable is a legitimate
signed program called VbsEdit Script Launcher. Once
the PowerShell script runs this file, the manifest is
loaded and executed from the same folder, ultimately
launching a RAT called Vw0rm (Vengeance Worm).2 This
execution ends the first branch of the infection chain.

9%

The second PowerShell command downloads and runs
another script from the web. This script checks if Avast
anti-virus is installed on the infected system. If this is the
case, it downloads and runs another PowerShell script,
eventually running an .exe and .dll containing NjRAT
malware.3 If this anti-virus product is not installed, the
script downloads and runs an .exe and .dll containing
AsyncRAT.4 The result is that the victim’s PC is infected
with Vw0rm and NjRat or AsyncRAT.

Hours on average
before threats
isolated by HP Wolf
Security were
known by hash to
other security tools

In this campaign, the attacker used VbsEdit Script
Launcher to proxy the execution of Vw0rm through a
trusted process (T1127), thereby bypassing application
allowlisting defenses on the PC and avoiding the
execution of “noisy” processes like wscript.exe and
cscript.exe that are commonly monitored by security
tools and Microsoft’s Antimalware Scanning Interface
(AMSI).5 Network defenders not only need to keep a
close eye on living-off-the-land binaries and scripts, but
also third-party development utilities that attackers can
use to run malicious code.6

Mekotio banker smuggled in HTML
files to Latin American banking
customers
In March, HP Wolf Security detected a malware
campaign delivering Mekotio, a banking Trojan, used by
threat actors to target online banking customers in Latin
America.7 The attackers targeted Portuguese speakers
with lures that purported to be parcel collection
notifications from a courier company. To bypass email
gateway security, they used a technique called HTML
smuggling (T1027.006).8 The malware steals online
banking credentials and other financial data from its
victims.

Double-clicking the HTML attachment opens the file in a
web browser, where the user is prompted to download a
.zip archive. The archive contains a Windows Installer file
(MSI), which unpacks and starts an .exe when executed.
Analyzing the executable’s resource section reveals an
AutoHotKey script, a popular scripting language used to
automate tasks in Windows.9

Figure 3 - Overview of Mekotio infection chain, March 2022

The executable runs the AutoHotKey script, which makes
an HTTP request to ipinfo[.]io. The response contains
information that geolocates the public IP address of the
infected PC. Since Mekotio targets victims in Latin
American countries, the script aborts if the victim’s IP
address is outside of Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, or
Argentina. If the victim is in one of the targeted locations,
the malware downloads and extracts a .zip archive
containing a .dll and an .exe file. These files are written
into a folder and then the .dll is renamed to shfolder.dll,
the name of a legitimate Windows library.

Threat Insights Report - Q1-2022

The executable, vmnat.exe, is a legitimate file used by
VMware Workstation, a desktop hypervisor. To run the
.dll, the malware relies on DLL search order hijacking
(T1574.001).10 Running vmnat.exe causes it to load the .dll
containing Mekotio instead of the legitimate shfolder.dll
library. This campaign shows how attackers chain
offensive techniques together to deliver their malicious
payloads unnoticed.

Aggah experiments with Microsoft
Publisher malware to deliver RATs
While attackers prefer Office formats like Excel, Word,
and PowerPoint to distribute malware, attackers
occasionally experiment with less popular formats too.
In February, HP Wolf Security detected a malware
campaign that used Microsoft Publisher (.pub) files to
trick victims - a format we seldom see being abused.

The attackers sent malicious .pub email attachments to
recipients pretending to be financial documents,
mentioning keywords such as “payroll”, “order”,
“purchase”, “inquiry” and “invoice” in the subject lines
and file names. The attackers used obfuscated Visual
Basic for Applications (VBA) macros that run when the
user closes the document.

Figure 4 - Microsoft Publisher file containing a malicious VBA macro
The macros assemble a URL and then opens it with
mshta.exe (T1218.005), a legitimate utility used to run
Microsoft HTML Applications (.hta) files.11 The utility runs
JavaScript and Visual Basic code hosted on a web page.
The code downloads secondary malware by compiling a
PowerShell script over several steps and running it. Next,
this script executes a .NET binary, which downloads and
launches the malware payload from the web. Attackers
used this campaign to spread Formbook and Agent
Tesla information-stealing malware.12 13

Threat Insights Report - Q1-2022

We found large overlaps in the tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTPs) of this campaign and another that
spread Agent Telsa in November 2021, attributed to a
threat group called Aggah.14 In that campaign, the VBA
macros were embedded in PowerPoint (.ppa and .ppam)
presentations and sent to targets by email. The code
used in both campaigns strongly resemble each other.
The shared TTPs suggests that this latest campaign also
originated from Aggah.

Malware isolated by HP Wolf Security
that used Office file formats

45%

PDF malware is not yet dead
In March, HP Wolf Security detected a malware
campaign spreading Snake Keylogger, delivered in PDF
documents.15 After opening the PDF email attachment,
the user is shown a prompt asking them to allow another
file to be opened. The attackers named the second file
“has been verified. However PDF, Jpeg, xlsx, .docx” to
make it appear as though the file name was part of a
prompt from Adobe Reader.

The second file is a Word document stored as an
“EmbeddedFile” in the PDF file. If the user clicks OK to the
prompt, the document opens in Microsoft Word,
connects to a URL, then loads an external object linking
and embedding (OLE) object. The object contains exploit
code that takes advantage of CVE-2017-11882, a
vulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor, ultimately
infecting the PC with Snake Keylogger.16

Fake Windows 11 upgrade website
spreads Redline Stealer
Threat actors are always looking for topical lures to
socially engineer victims into infecting systems. Shortly
after an announcement about Windows 11 in January, a
malicious actor registered the domain windowsupgraded[.]com, which they used to spread malware by
tricking users into downloading and running a fake
installer. The domain caught our attention because it
was newly registered, imitated a legitimate brand and
took advantage of a recent announcement. The threat
actor used this domain to distribute RedLine Stealer, an
information-stealing malware family that is widely
advertised for sale within underground forums.17

We tracked a similar campaign in December 2021.18 Back
then, the threat actor registered discrodappp[.]com,
which they used to serve RedLine Stealer disguised as
an installer for the popular messaging app. In both
campaigns, the attacker used fake websites to mimic
popular software to trick users into installing their
malware, registered the domains using the same domain
registrar, used the same DNS servers, and delivered the
same malware family. This campaign highlights how
attackers are quick to take advantage of important,
relevant and interesting current events to create
effective lures.

Malware campaigns targeting
African banking sector
The top motivation behind cybercrime is financial
enrichment, and the financial services industry is an
attractive target for cybercriminals. In early 2022, HP
Wolf Security isolated a targeted malware campaign
against an employee of a West African bank.19 The user
received an email purporting to be from a recruiter from
another African bank with information about job
opportunities there. The campaign caught our attention
because of its targeted nature and how the threat actor
attempted to deliver malware using HTML smuggling.

The attackers registered at least one domain mimicking
a legitimate bank. One of the domains displayed a web
page about the bank’s employment application process,
which was likely copied from the legitimate
organization’s website.
Opening the HTML file prompts the victim to download
an .iso archive, which in turn contains a Visual Basic
script. The script delivers GuLoader malware, which is
executed using PowerShell code stored the Registry and
is otherwise only run in memory.20

Notable Trends
Rise in Emotet
samples isolated
over previous
quarter

28x

Top exploited
vulnerabilities

Surge in Emotet malicious spam
targeting Japanese organizations
Emotet, once described by Europol as the most
dangerous malware in the world, was largely inactive
from January to October 2021.21 However from October,
the malware started being delivered as a secondary
payload after a PC is infected with TrickBot malware.22 In
late February 2022, HP Wolf Security detected a surge in
Emotet email spam, representing a 28-fold (2,823%)
increase in sightings in Q1 2022 compared to the
previous quarter.
The malware rose 36 places to become the most
popular family in circulation, behind Agent Tesla and
Nemucod. The campaigns primarily targeted Japanese
organizations through malicious Excel spreadsheets
(.xlsm). HP Wolf Security detected a 23% increase in
spreadsheet threats over last quarter, partially driven by
growing Emotet activity.
Emotet’s operators have automated the creation of
spearphishing lures, using a technique called email
thread hijacking to trick recipients into infecting their
PCs. By exfiltrating victims’ email mailboxes, the botnet
spoofs sender addresses, subject lines, attachment file
names and the body text of emails. This stolen data is
used to craft convincing emails that are sent as replies
to existing email threads, with the goal of tricking targets
into opening malicious email attachments and links.

JavaScript and Java-based
malware on the rise
In Q1 2022, HP Wolf Security detected a rise in Java and
JavaScript malware. Java archive threats (.jar) saw a
476% increase over the previous quarter, while
JavaScript malware saw a 42% increase in the same
period.

Microsoft Office remains most
targeted application for exploits
The top three exploited vulnerabilities isolated by HP
Wolf Security in Q1 2022 all targeted Office applications.
There was a 5% increase in CVE-2017-11882 exploits from
last quarter, a modest 3% increase in CVE-2018-0802
exploits, and a 7% drop in CVE-2017-0199 exploits.23 24
