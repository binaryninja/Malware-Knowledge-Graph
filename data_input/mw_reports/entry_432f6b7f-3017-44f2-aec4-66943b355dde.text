Executive Summary
SecurityScorecard has identified domains resolving to Iran-linked Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) infrastructure, likely to be used to support phishing campaigns against
Egypt-based shipping and marine services companies.
In at least three instances, Iran-linked APT actors may have gained unauthorized
access to the DNS configuration of legitimate domains to create rogue subdomains.
CNAME records were used to forward requests to unauthorized third-party mail servers
that were under the control of malicious actors.
SecurityScorecard assesses with high confidence that these subdomains were created
to support Iran-linked APT phishing campaigns.

Background
On August 23, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) released a blog about a new data
extraction tool used by an Iranian APT. While the tool was designed to be run locally, it still
needed to receive a response from one of two Command and Control (C2) servers before
proceeding. TAG identified these IPs as 136.243.108[.]14 (Germany) and 173.209.51[.]54
(Canada)
Interesting Subdomains
Pivoting on the information provided by TAG, SecurityScorecard’s Threat Research,
Intelligence, Knowledge and Engagement (STRIKE) Team got to work. We started by looking
at the C2 IP, 136.243.108[.]14, and quickly discovered that it was hosting some interesting
mail subdomains. Dig requests for each of these subdomains reveal that they each have
CNAME record that points to smtp11.smtplab[.]com. Browsing to smtp11.smptlab[.]com
redirects to smtp11.smtplab[.]com/webmail/login, which displays a Kerio Connect Secure
Email login interface. According to its website, Kerio Connect is a mail server and all-in-one
collaboration tool that is easy to manage and deploy. It is just the right size for small and
medium businesses with smaller budgets and limited IT staff.

STRIKE analyzed all the mail servers resolving to IP 136.243.108[.]14 and determined that
most are typosquatted domains, attempting to pose as mail servers belonging to the targeted
entities.

Likely Targets

3/6

Most of these imposter mail subdomains appear to target Egypt-based shipping and marine
services companies. Many of the non-shipping services Egyptian firms listed above are also
based in Port Said; attempts to impersonate them may, therefore, still reflect the targeting of
the shipping service industry. Port Said is a shipping hub, and professional services firms
located there likely serve the area’s major industries. That being the case, those firms also
likely handle data relevant to the shipping and marine services industries and could therefore
prove to be of interest to a threat actor looking to access such data.
STRIKE identified a series of domains related to investment in the Eilat region of southern
Israel. These domains simply switch an “L” with a “T” (i.e., eilatinvest[.]com/eitatinvest[.]com).
Eilat is close to Israel’s border with Jordan and home to the Trans-Israel pipeline's southern
terminal, originally built as a joint venture between Iran and Israel back in friendlier times.
Iran was no longer able to use the pipeline after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979 and
pursued a claim for compensation against Israel. The case was decided in Iran’s favor in
2016, awarding $1.1 billion. Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company is one of Israel's most
secretive companies. The current wonder of the pipeline, the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline
Company (EAPC), enjoys a state decree that shrouds its affairs in secrecy for reasons the
Israeli government says are related to national security.
Other domains appeared to imitate the legitimate domain of a prominent law firm in the UAE,
whose clients include H. H. SH. Saeed Bin Mohammed Hasher Al Maktoum.
All of the typo-squatted top-level domains were registered with the same registration details,
indicating that they are Wild West Domains resold by a small Egyptian hosting company
called EgWan. EgWan also provides other hosting services, such as email via Office 365.

Rogue Subdomains
STRIKE identified three other mail server subdomains that at first appeared to be typosquatted, but further investigation revealed that they are more likely rogue subdomains of
legitimate domains. For example, elephantmarine[.]com leads to what appears to be a
legitimate website that has been around since at least 2011, currently hosted on IP address
207.180.247[.]135. However mail.elephantmarine[.]com is hosted on 136.243.108[.]14, with
a CNAME record directing it to smpt11.smtplab[.]com. Two other examples of these rogue
subdomains are mail.hhfis[.]com and mail.etisalategypt[.]com.
According to Whois information, these domains were also registered through EgWan. To
create a subdomain, one would need to have access to the CPanel, or DNS configuration,
for these domains. It is possible that the threat actor managed to gain access to one or both
of these via an unknown method. Once they gained access, they were able to create the
rogue mail subdomain, and point it to the same infrastructure as the typo-squatted domains,
namely IP 136.243.108[.]14 and smpt11.smtplab[.]com.
Attribution
Google does not discuss the apparent use of hijacked subdomains to impersonate various
Middle Eastern businesses in its recent report on the HYPERSCRAPE tool it attributed to
APT35/Charming Kitten. However, the targeting suggested by these impersonations would
be in keeping with Iran-linked APT groups’ established patterns. Suchgroups have, in the

past, targeted large industries in the US client states in the region (like Egypt and the UAE,)
and such targeting likely still serves Iranian regional interests in the present. Thus, based on
this targeting and the links to infrastructure used in activity attributed to APT35, STRIKE
assesses with high confidence that these subdomains were created to support Iran-linked
APT phishing campaigns.
Recommendations
It is important to be aware of domain names impersonating your own, as these will likely be
used to facilitate attacks on your organization. STRIKE recommends using a brand
monitoring service, such as SecurityScorecard’s Cyber Risk Intelligence (CRI), that detects
impostor domains and helps mitigate your exposure to this critical cyber risk.
