upon Your compliance with all of Your obligations under this Agreement. Except
for the express licenses granted in this Section, no other rights or licenses are
granted by Venafi, expressly, by implication, by way of estoppel or otherwise. The

subject to the following restrictions and limitations:
1. If You have registered to access and use the Venafi Cloud for DevOps
Service, You must use SSL/TLS certificates issued to you at no charge
through the Service for development and testing purposes only, and You are
strictly prohibited from using such SSL/TLS certificates in a production
environment or in any production capacity. If you are registered with a public
Certification Authority (“CA”) supported by the Service and have valid
credentials issued by such CA with which you can subscribe to such CA’s
SSL/TLS certificates on a fee bearing basis for use in production
environments, You may request such certificates through the applicable
interface present in the Service by using such credentials. In such instance,
the fee bearing certificate(s) will be issued to You by the CA and any access
to or use of such certificates by You will be subject to the terms and
conditions set out by the CA. No fees will be paid to or processed by Venafi
in this case. The use of DigiCert issued certificates shall be subject to the
Certificate Services Agreement published by DigiCert at
https://www.digicert.com/docs/agreements/Certificate-ServicesAgreement.pdf, which terms are hereby incorporated by reference.

third party, including without limitation by rental, in the operation of an
Applications Service Provider (ASP) service offering or as a service bureau,
or any similar means.

third party or parties. You shall not permit sublicensing, leasing, or other
transfer of the Service.

Service or third-party data contained therein, (b) attempt to gain
unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks, (c)
permit direct or indirect access to or use of the Service in a way that
circumvents a contractual usage limit, or (d) access the Service in order to
build a competitive product or service.

to Venafi. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the License, You
