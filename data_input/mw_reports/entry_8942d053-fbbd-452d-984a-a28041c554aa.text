Analysis process
The file is a Dotnet PE:

1/11

On execution the file spawns a child process of the legitimate Dotnet AppLaunch.exe:

There is only one reason to do that - Process Hollowing (A.K.A RunPE). As i learned from
the great OALabs channel, whenever you want to break with a dubugger on an injection to
a remote process, CreateProcessInternalW and WriteProcessMemory are the first
calls that you want to put a break on. doing as i learned gave me a quick treat:

2/11

The malware is calling to CreateProcessInternalW , pass AppLaunch.exe as a
parameter, and "4" as seventh argument which will make the process in suspended mode
(Process Hollowing creates a process in suspended mode so it can hollows out the
process, inject, and then execute).
We could manually find the unpacked PE in memory and dump it, and we also can be lazy
and let great Hollows_Hunter.exe do it for us:

Dropping the unpacked (Dotnet as well) to Dnspy hollows out our eyes

ðŸ˜¨:

Not sure if the file dumped successfully or this one is perfectly obfuscated. Trying to
deobfuscate with De4dot:

3/11

is throwing an error.. a closer look at the file in Dnspy reveals the obfuscator which
apparently is not supported / known by De4dot:

Some googling on deobfuscating ConfuserEx gives us this project which adds to De4dot
exactly this capability:

Now the file is dumped and cleand (pretty much)

ðŸ˜Ž.

Analyzing the code (which is still a bit obfuscated) reveals that this is a kelogger / stealer
(with some RAT capabilities) named HawkEye Reborn version 8:

Description from Malpedia:

4/11

HawKeye is a keylogger that is distributed since 2013. Discovered by IBM X-Force, it
is currently spread over phishing campaigns targeting businesses on a worldwide
scale. It is designed to steal credentials from numerous applications but, in the last
observed versions, new "loader capabilities" have been spotted. It is sold by its
development team on dark web markets and hacking forums.
From here on i used only static analysis on the unpacked sample

Anti-Analysis capabilities
Checks if it runs under process monitor software:

Checks if it runs under Sandboxie (SbieDll.dll) or Wireshark:

Disables Task Manager, Cmd, and Regedit:

5/11

Sets hidden + system attributes for itself:

The malware has the functionality to block websites by overriding the Hosts file and
redirect them to the localhost address:

Stealing capabilities
The malware has Keylogging capabilities (Also called HawkEye Keylogger):

6/11

Takes screenshots of the infected computer:

Steals Chrome browser data:

7/11

Steals Firefox browser data:

Steals CoreFTP software data:

Steals Minecraft data:

8/11

Collects a plenty of more information: internal & external address, geolocation, installed
software, clipboard content, screenshots, passwords and more:

9/11

And post all the data to the C2:

C2: pomf.cat

Persistence:
The malware persist itself via a run key:

More capabilities:
The malware uses P/Invoke calls to native libraries to extend the capabilities and harden
the analysis:

10/11

Seems like the next commands are used to be written into a .bat file that responsible for
the persistence via the run key, it's executes the malware, and then possibly deletes itself
(and written back next execution, depending if is written to "run" or "runonce"):

Also, the malware seems to inject itself into a remote process due to these API calls:

That's it for today, hope you enjoyed â˜º
