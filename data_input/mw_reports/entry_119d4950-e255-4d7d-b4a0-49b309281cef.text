Introduction

Backdoor attacks bypass standard authentication rules to access sensitive data
and usually provide complete control of a victim’s device with a persistent (but hidden)
connection. These attacks can be challenging to detect because they circumvent many
controls and policies designed to protect sensitive data against unauthorized access.
This report explores the command and control structure of one of the cybercrime industries’
better-known backdoor malware variants. The TA505 threat group manages its ServHelper
backdoor malware by using a software control panel called TeslaGun. TeslaGun name
occurs on the top left of its control panels with a blue label and version number (can be
seen in Figure 3).
TA505 is a financially motivated threat group that has been active since 2014. The group
frequently changes its malware attack strategies in response to global cybercrime trends [5].
It opportunistically adopts new technologies in order to gain leverage over victims before
the wider cybersecurity industry catches on.
This report provides insight into how TA505 enables and manages these attacks through its
”TeslaGun” control panel. The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) team identified the group’s
control panel and used it to glean insight into how the organization works.
This insight will help information security executives, legal professionals, and cybercrime
insurers to understand the threat that TA505 poses to its victims. It will provide a clear
foundation for resolving liability issues related to ServHelper attacks specifically, and
backdoor attacks more generally.
Many reputable sources have already provided valuable sample analysis covering TA505’s
backdoor attack methods. This report focuses on new information ; how the group’s
”TeslaGun” control panel enables the distribution of backdoor attacks, and what that can tell
the cybersecurity community about TA505’s motivations, strategies, and internal organizing
principles.
This report holds valuable, previously unreported analysis of ServHelper campaigns and
samples. Similarly, it contains findings from the group’s C&C server, including infection dates,
targeted countries, executed commands, and other valuable information regarding the
group’s techniques and tactics.

Executive Summary

2.1

Overview

The group has carried out mass phishing campaigns and targeted campaigns on at
least 8160 targets, largely focusing on finance sector companies and individuals. According
to unearthed TeslaGun victim data, TA505 mostly targeted the U.S, which is home to 3667 of
the group’s victims (as shown in Figure 1).

Figure 1. Victim distribution by country.

The group makes its priorities clear in a footnote located inside the TeslaGun panel, which
says ”Huawey Coproration with love to USA”, as shown in Figure 2 (The typo exists in the
original text).

TA505 Group’s TeslaGun In-Depth Analysis

Characteristics of the TA505 Group

Financial Motivation : The PTI team observed that the main dashboard of the TeslaGun
panel includes comments attached to victim records. These records show victim device
data such as CPU, GPU, RAM size and internet connection speed.
This information shows that ”ServHelper” users are actively profiling their victims, and TA505
members may use this data to decide which victims’ devices are suitable for crypto-mining.[4]
On the other hand, according to victim comments, it is clear that TA505 is actively looking
for online banking or retail users, including crypto-wallets and e-commerce accounts.
Targeting Financial Sector : According to the PTI Team victim analysis, most TA505 victims
operate in the financial sector. However, it is readily apparent that TA505 opportunistically
targets individuals and organizations in non-related sectors as well. The group dedicates
resources to maintaining backdoor connections and actively tries to sell those connections
to other cybercriminals4.
Malware Toolkit : According to the third-party technical analysis and samples available on
public threat platforms, TA505 uses various droppers as well as delivery techniques for their
backdoor malware attacks [2][4].
Targeted Countries : While the United States is by far the most frequently targeted region,
with 3667 attacks recorded, TA505’s next most common targets include Russia (647), Brazil
(483), Romania (444), and the United Kingdom (359).
Fraudulent Activities : Although ”ServHelper” does not need interaction or manual
configuration, TA505 members often interact directly with victim devices through the Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) with multiple sessions. The PTI team detected TA505 threat actors
downloading and installing custom tools like (sep12.exe) via patched RDP sessions to carry
out fraudulent activities.
Multiple Campaigns : A single instance of the ”TeslaGun” control panel contains multiple
campaign records representing different delivery methods and attack data. Newer versions of
the malware encode these different campaigns as campaign IDs. We observed a significant
number of different victim profiles and campaigns during our investigation. Other researchers
analyzing the group’s malware samples also concluded that TA505 operates multiple attack
vectors, apparently and simultaneously [6].

TA505 Group’s TeslaGun In-Depth Analysis

Technical Analysis

This section analyzes the TA505 group’s C&C infrastructure and the technology being
used for RDP/VNC connections.

3.1

ServHelper

Although the ServHelper code base gets changed rapidly, one aspect of the software
stands out, its backdoor account is named WgaUtilAcc and it can be found on user
registries under .../Winlogon/SpecialAccounts/UserList [1]. The following table shows how
this backdoor is being created in step-by-step format :
Command
net user WgaUtilAcc <Password>
net LOCALGROUP ”Administrators” WgaUtilAcc /ADD
net LOCALGROUP ”Remote Desktop Users” WgaUtilAcc /ADD
net LOCALGROUP ”Remote Desktop Users” %USERNAME% /ADD
wmic path win32_VideoController get name
wmic CPU get NAME
powershell -ep bypass -NoProfile -outputformat text -nologo
-noninteractive -enc %Trimmed...%

Description
Creates WgaUtilAcc
Adds backdoor user to Administrator group
Adds backdoor account to RDP group
Adds current account to RDP group
Gets GPU Name
Gets CPU Name
Execute connection speed testing script.

Once the PTI performed detailed analysis on one of TA505’s TeslaGun panels, it could easily
profile how ServHelper communicates with its C&C infrastructure. These profiles enabled the
team to analyze samples on other sandbox and open threat exchange platforms, resulting
in panels & IPs similar to those TA505 manages.
This does not mean that this report exhaustively covers all TA505 domains and IPs. The
group may be operating additional domains through domain generation algorithms (DGAs)
and proxy servers as well.
For example the domain, which is dkaknvizisic.xyz, has not been flagged in VirusTotal (at the
of the investigation) as malicious for security. This domain occurs to be a brand new CC
TeslaGun panel associated with 37 victims at the moment of our investigation. We have
found data corresponding to these victims tagged with the sep27 campaign code.

Please note that this report has two versions. The ”Private Release” is provided to law
enforcement agencies, applicable CERTS / CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A. Threat
Intel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the ”Public
Release” is publicly disseminated for the purpose of advancing global fight against
high-end threat actors and APTs such as TA505.

Infrastructure

The actors regularly migrate their proxy servers to new servers in the same datacenter
to attain a low detection rate. During our investigation, we observed several TeslaGun
management panels predominantly residing in MivoCloud SRL, Moldova, as show in Table

Command & Control Servers

The TeslaGun panel has a pragmatic, minimalist design. The main dashboard only
contains infected victim data, a generic comment section for each victim, and several
options for filtering victim records.

Figure 3. Dashboard of the TeslaGun management panel.

The panel’s filtering options offer a great deal of information about TA505’s workflow and
commercial strategy. Sell and Sell 2 groups were set for some victims. These victims’ RDP
connections were temporarily disabled through the panel.

TA505 Group’s TeslaGun In-Depth Analysis

This probably means that TA505 can not immediately earn a profit from exploiting those
particular victims. Instead of letting them go, the group has tagged those victim’s RDP
connections for the resale to other cybercriminals.
The ERR group refers to those victims who have a slow connection. If the victim’s connection
is too slow, TA505’s RDP connection will not work properly, and the group in this case loses
the ability to communicate with ServHelper effectively.
TeslaGun panels do not provide individual victim detail pages. Instead, victim tables show
data in a series of columns :

• SYSID/ID/IP
• Country/State/City
Time Connected/Last Time Connected
• First
Command
• Answer Operations/Tun Port/Operations
• Comments
•
The SYSID column refers to multiple aspects of the backdoor attack on a victim’s device, as
explained in Binary Defence’s comprehensive blog[1]. This column shows the following data :
{Campaign Code};
{OS Name};
{Architecture};
{Computer Name};
{Local Account Name};
{Backdoor Account:WgaUtilAcc};
{Backdoor Account's Password}

The Cisco Talos’s Intelligence Group [4] has already identified how these data relate to
ServHelper’s command list and functionalities. Panel users can send these commands to
victim’s devices through TeslaGun panels.
Moreover, TeslaGun has a functionality that allows attackers to send one command to all
victim devices in one step, or to configure a default command that runs when a new victim
device is added to the panel.
Figure 5 shows how running a command or changing the task for a specific victim works in
the TeslaGun panel.

TA505 Group’s TeslaGun In-Depth Analysis

Post Infection

During this investigation, the PTI team discovered TA505 users executing RDP connections
using tunnels. Other technical reports[4] also note this kind of activity, but do not mention
where these tunneled connections are going.

Figure 6. TA505 Member is installing sep12.exe into victim device.

This tool 6.2 lets attackers launch multiple hidden RDP instances. After infecting a victim,
TA505 members connect to the victim via RDP upon infection to use these remote
connections simultaneously.

Although, the samples communicate to panel domains, threat actors connect to their
victim’s RDP via tunnels. This command is called ”bk” in the C&C panel. Threat actors
can send the ”bk” command to establish RDP tunnels, then connect to the victim’s RDP
through a selected port on a proxy server. These IPs are not flagged as malicious on
public lists, which means TA505 can often bypass signature-based detection solutions.

TA505 Group’s TeslaGun In-Depth Analysis

Statistics & Observations

This section covers some of the important insights surrounding TA505’s impact on
different countries and victims. Here, we present our findings from the C&C server, which
match the TA505 group’s actions with the known timelines of several TA505 campaigns.
The PTI team’s analysis shows that each C&C instance has a separate victim database.
Victim record IDs as a result are not unique. TA505 uniquely identifies victims across
databases by using their SYSID.
There is evidence that victims can be transferred across panels and instances. For
example, in one panel located on dfsrakizimoy34ggf.xyz, the oldest victim was logged on
2020-07-15, through a campaign tagged as jul11. However, according to Whois information
for that domain, entry was updated at 2021-09-26 17:16:39.0Z. Alternatively, the date of
this domain was first seen is 2020-03-27 08:50 and the resolved IP was 5.181.156.5. This
IP is different, unlike the IP of the latest entry. This situation indicates that the victims
must have been transferred from another instance. The PTI Team also detected that one
single domain may include more than one panel, and these panels have different databases.
Unearthed information indicates that campaigns’ samples are not only for single time
use. For example, for dec4 and dec27 ; the campaigns’ oldest victims were first logged
on ”2020-12-11” and ”2021-01-03” respectively. However, the dec4 campaign’s malware
did not stop spreading after dec27 was launched. One of dec4’s victims was first
logged on ”2021-01-13”, right after the start of the dec27 campaign. Much later, this
iteration started to show up again in August 2021, and has been extended to September 2021.
This clearly shows that TeslaGun panels are not exclusively organized according to
campaigns or versions. This makes it difficult to capture and define the overall structure of
TA505 as an organization. The group may have additional activities outside the context of
what the PTI team found during its investigation. Figure 8 represents the all versions of what
the PTI team could gather from the TeslaGun panels investigateion.

oct5 is the variation with the highest victim count (6340). According to the first victims logged

Affected Countries and Sectors

The US is by far the most frequently targeted region with 3667 attacks recorded. TA505
has explicitly shown its preference for US victims with its ”Huawey” footnote. This, alongside
a notable preference for Chinese top-level domains, might be designed to implicate China
in TA505’s attacks.
However, it is possible that these signs are merely red herrings designed to throw threat
intelligence operatives off-track. The general consensus of the cybersecurity community is
that TA505 is probably located somewhere in Eastern Europe, and is motivated by direct
financial gain rather than national politics. The group does not appear to exclude specific
nationalities or languages the way some other cybercrime groups do. TA505 victims can be
anyone from anywhere.

It is plain to see that Romania is the most frequently targeted country in the European Union.
Spain has also faced more attacks than most other EU countries. Russia and the United
Kingdom are outside the EU but in close geographical proximity, and have similarly high
numbers of victims. Figure 10 illustrates the number of victims from Europe, organized by
country.

Figure 10. Victim distribution in Europe.

It is worth noting that the majority of IP addresses, TA505 uses to manage and operate
ServHelper software belong to a hosting company located in Moldova (MivoCloud SRL),
while most of its EU-based victims are located in Romania. The two countries share a
common language and culture, yet are are on very different geopolitical terms. Investigators
have linked TA505 activities to Eastern Europe in the past, but this is an important new piece
of evidence linking the group to a specific country.
TA505 has already demonstrated its preference for opportunistic financial gain over political
motivations. It’s possible that Romanian victims simply make easy targets for Moldavian
threat actors due to their shared language and culture, but this conjecture is based on
circumstantial evidence.

TA505 Group’s TeslaGun In-Depth Analysis

Conclusion

ServHelper is an example of backdoor malware runs by a financially motivated and
highly sophisticated threat group. TA505 appears to be well-embedded in the international
cybercrime community, as demonstrated by its ability to collect and sell RDP connections to
victim devices. The PTI team was able to gain valuable insight into how TA505 organizes
its activities and achieves its goals. This will help cybersecurity policies to protect against
backdoor attacks like ServHelper.
From how TA505 commented their victims on TeslaGun panels perspective, it is obviously
seen that TA505 is actively searching for online banking and shopping accounts, particularly
from victims in the United States, but also from Russia, Romania, Brazil, and the UK. The
threat group will also attack victims outside of its primary scope, tagging RDP connections
for eventual resale to other cybercriminals. Ultimately, anyone could be a TA505 victim.
The PTI team observed that TA505’s internal structure is surprisingly disorganized. TeslaGun
panels are not exclusively separated by campaign and do not include individual victim
detail pages. Despite this fact, TA505 members carefully monitor their victims and can
demonstrate remarkable patience, especially with high-value victims in the finance sector.
In spite of loose internal organization, TA505 is highly proactive when it comes to updating
its malware. It can run multiple malware campaigns simultaneously and will frequently
update its tools and techniques to evade detection. These campaigns may include unique
tools and concepts that are not found in other campaigns[3]. The group’s agility can make it
difficult to predict and hard to detect over time.
The group does exhibit some telltale weaknesses, however. While TA505 can maintain hidden
connections on victims’ devices for months, its members are often unusually noisy. After
installing ServHelper, TA505 threat actors may manually connect to victim devices through
RDP tunneling. Security technologies capable of detecting these tunnels may prove vital for
catching and mitigating TA505’s backdoor attacks.
Proactive detection strategies are critical for overcoming fast-moving threats like TA505
backdoor attack campaigns. Broadly defined prevention-based security may help mitigate
some of the most obvious threats, but the reality of today’s mature, organized cybercrime
industry requires a new strategy. Business leaders and cybersecurity decision-makers
must actively search for new cybercrime trends and implement solutions for patching new
vulnerabilities in their networks.
