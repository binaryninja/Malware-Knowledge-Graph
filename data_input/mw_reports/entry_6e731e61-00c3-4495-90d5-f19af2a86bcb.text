Shylock’s New Trick: Evading Malware Researchers

Shylock is a financial malware platform discovered by IBM Security in 2011. Like most
malware strains, it continues to evolve in order to bypass new defensive technologies put in
place by financial institutions and enterprises. While analyzing a recent Shylock dropper, we
noticed a new trick it uses to evade detection. Namely, it can identify and avoid remote
desktop environments, a setup commonly used by researchers when analyzing malware.

Exploiting the Lab
Researchers collect suspected malware samples for analysis and often place them onto
machines that are isolated in an operations center, also known as a lab. Rather than sit in
front of a rack of physical machines in a cold basement lab, researchers use remote desktop
connections to study malware from the convenience and coziness of their offices. It is this
human weakness that Shylock exploits. We have discovered advanced malware that is now
capable of detecting remote desktop environments to evade researchers.
The Shylock dropper we discovered detects a remote desktop environment by feeding
invalid data into a certain routine and then observing the error code returned. It uses this
return code to differentiate between normal desktops and other lab environments. In
particular, when executed from a remote desktop session, the return code will be different
and Shylock won’t install. It is possible to use this method to identify other known or
proprietary virtual/sandbox environments, as well.
For those more technically oriented, here is a bit more detail. The dropper dynamically loads
Winscard.dll and calls the function SCardForgetReaderGroupA(0, 0). The malware proceeds
as expected only if the return value is either 0x80100011 (SCARD_E_INVALID_VALUE) or

0x2 (ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND).
We noticed that when the dropper is executed locally, the return value is 0x80100011, but
when it is executed from a remote desktop session the return value is 0x80100004
(SCARD_E_INVALID_PARAMETER). The assembly language source code is shown below.
We have found a number of malware strains that utilize different approaches to identify
specific execution environments in order to take appropriate evasive actions. The assembly
language source code is shown below.

IBM vs. Shylock
IBM Security solutions are not affected by anti-VM/anti-research techniques employed by
malware. This is because we use real-time application protection to monitor for suspected
malware behavior in the endpoint device’s memory. This approach prevents malware from
compromising applications, including the browser, and stealing data like user credentials. It is
also immune to malware evasion techniques designed to identify remote desktop and virtual
machine environments.
