Strengthening Cybersecurity of SATCOM
Network Providers and Customers
Updated May 10, 2022: The U.S. government attributes this threat activity to Russian state-sponsored
malicious cyber actors. Additional information may be found in a statement from the State
Department. For more information on Russian malicious cyber activity, refer to cisa.gov/uscert/russia.

SUMMARY
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
are aware of possible threats to U.S. and international
satellite communication (SATCOM) networks.
Successful intrusions into SATCOM networks could
create risk in SATCOM network providers’ customer
environments.
Given the current geopolitical situation, CISA’s Shields
Up initiative requests that all organizations significantly
lower their threshold for reporting and sharing
indications of malicious cyber activity. To that end, CISA
and FBI will update this joint Cybersecurity Advisory
(CSA) as new information becomes available so that
SATCOM providers and their customers can take
additional mitigation steps pertinent to their
environments.

Actions to Take Today:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Use secure methods for
authentication.
Enforce principle of least
privilege.
Review trust relationships.
Implement encryption.
Ensure robust patching and
system configuration audits.
Monitor logs for suspicious
activity.
Ensure incident response,
resilience, and continuity of
operations plans are in place.

CISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that
are either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the mitigations outlined
in this CSA to strengthen SATCOM network cybersecurity.
To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local
FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by email at CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and
location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the
submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact. To request incident response resources or technical
assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at report@cisa.gov.

MITIGATIONS
CISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that
are either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the following
mitigations:

Mitigations for SATCOM Network Providers
●

●

Put in place additional monitoring at ingress and egress points to SATCOM
equipment to look for anomalous traffic, such as:
o The presence of insecure remote access tools—such as Teletype Network
Protocol (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell Protocol (SSH),
Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), and Virtual Network Computing (VNC)—facilitating
communications to and from SATCOM terminals.
o Network traffic from SATCOM networks to other unexpected network segments.
o Unauthorized use of local or backup accounts within SATCOM networks.
o Unexpected SATCOM terminal to SATCOM terminal traffic.
o Network traffic from the internet to closed group SATCOM networks.
o Brute force login attempts over SATCOM network segments.
See the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Annual Threat Assessment
of the U.S. Intelligence Community, February 2022 for specific state-sponsored cyber
threat activity relating to SATCOM networks.

Mitigations for SATCOM Network Providers and Customers
●

●

●

Use secure methods for authentication, including multifactor authentication where
possible, for all accounts used to access, manage, and/or administer SATCOM networks.
o Use and enforce strong, complex passwords: Review password policies to ensure
they align with the latest NIST guidelines.
o Do not use default credentials or weak passwords.
o Audit accounts and credentials: remove terminated or unnecessary accounts;
change expired credentials.
Enforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies. Minimize
unnecessary privileges for identities. Consider privileges assigned to individual personnel
accounts, as well as those assigned to non-personnel accounts (e.g., those assigned to
software or systems). Account privileges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and
regularly audited against usage patterns.
Review trust relationships. Review existing trust relationships with IT service providers.
Threat actors are known to exploit trust relationships between providers and their
customers to gain access to customer networks and data.
o Remove unnecessary trust relationships.
o Review contractual relationships with all service providers. Ensure contracts
include appropriate provisions addressing security, such as those listed below, and
that these provisions are appropriately leveraged:
▪ Security controls the customer deems appropriate.

Provider should have in place appropriate monitoring and logging of
provider-managed customer systems.
▪ Customer should have in place appropriate monitoring of the service
provider’s presence, activities, and connections to the customer network.
▪ Notification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents
occurring on the provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks.
Implement independent encryption across all communications links leased from, or
provided by, your SATCOM provider. See National Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity
Advisory: Protecting VSAT Communications for guidance.

Strengthen the security of operating systems, software, and firmware.
o Ensure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place
and, after testing, immediately patch known exploited vulnerabilities included in
CISA's living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities carry
significant risk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities.
o Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs
can track and mitigate emerging threats. Regularly audit system configurations for
misconfigurations and security weaknesses
Monitor network logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized or unusual login
attempts.
o Integrate SATCOM traffic into existing network security monitoring tools.
o Review logs of systems behind SATCOM terminals for suspicious activity.
o Ingest system and network generated logs into your enterprise security information
and event management (SIEM) tool.
o Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools where possible on
devices behind SATCOM terminals, and ingest into the SIEM.
o Expand and enhance monitoring of network segments and assets that use
SATCOM.
o Expand monitoring to include ingress and egress traffic transiting SATCOM links
and monitor for suspicious or anomalous network activity.
o Baseline SATCOM network traffic to determine what is normal and investigate
deviations, such as large spikes in traffic.
Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response plan, resilience plan, and
continuity of operations plan so that critical functions and operations can be kept
running if technology systems—including SATCOM networks—are disrupted or need to be
taken offline.

CONTACT
All organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations Center at
report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7
CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.
