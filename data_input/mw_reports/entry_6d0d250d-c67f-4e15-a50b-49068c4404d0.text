May 12, 2020

Tropic Trooper, a threat actor group that targets government, military, healthcare,
transportation, and high-tech industries in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong, has been
active since 2011. The group was reportedly using spear-phishing emails with weaponized
attachments to exploit known vulnerabilities. Primarily motivated by information theft and
espionage, the group has also been seen adopting different strategies such as fine-tuning
tools with new behaviors and going mobile with surveillanceware.
We found that Tropic Trooper’s latest activities center on targeting Taiwanese and the
Philippine military’s physically isolated networks through a USBferry attack (the name
derived from a sample found in a related research). We also observed targets among
military/navy agencies, government institutions, military hospitals, and even a national bank.
The group employs USBferry, a USB malware that performs different commands on specific
targets, maintains stealth in environments, and steals critical data through USB storage. We
started tracking this particular campaign in 2018, and our analysis shows that it uses a fake
executable decoy and a USB trojan strategy to steal information.
Based on data from the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ security infrastructure,
USBferry attacks have been active since 2014. We found the group was focused on stealing
defense-, ocean-, and ship-related documents from target networks, which led us to believe
that Tropic Trooper’s main purpose is to exfiltrate confidential information or intelligence.

Tropic Trooper is well aware that military or government organizations may have more robust
security in their physically isolated environments (i.e., the use of biometrics or USB use in a
quarantined machine before an air-gapped environment). The group then targets potentially
unsecured related organizations that could serve as jumping-off points for attacks. For
instance, we observed Tropic Trooper move from a military hospital to the military’s
physically isolated network.
This blog post provides an overview of the USB malware called USBferry and its capabilities,
as well as the other tools used to infiltrate physically isolated environments. Further details,
including indicators of compromise (IoCs), can be read in the technical brief.

A USB malware called USBferry
We first encountered the malware from a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that mentioned a
sample related to Tropic Trooper but did not include a detailed analysis. We looked into it
further and discovered many versions of it, including several program database (PDB)
strings. For one thing, the USBferry malware already has at least three versions, with
different variants and components, at the time of writing. Here are the noteworthy points we
gathered during analysis:
The first version has a small component of TROJ_YAHOYAH. The malware tries to
check if the target machine has a USB plug-in and copies the USBferry installer into
the USB storage. The activities vary in target environments; some execute commands,
source target files or folder lists, and copy files from physically isolated hosts to
compromised hosts, among other things.

Figure 2. USBferry malware’s first version, where the EXE file is the USBferry malware and
the DLL file is trojan TROJ_YAHOYAH
The second version has the same capabilities as the first and combines components
into one executable. This version also changes the malware location and its name to
UF, an abbreviation for USBferry.

The third version retains the previous versions’ capabilities and improves its stealth in
the target environment by residing in the rundll32.exe memory.

How USBferry targets air-gapped systems
In our technical brief, we broke down how Tropic Trooper has changed the way it uses the
abovementioned USBferry versions in attacks. The group achieves infection by employing
the USB worm infection strategy and ferrying a malware installer via USB into an air-gapped
host machine.

Here we will discuss the notable changes in the group’s latest attack chain that uses version
UF1.0 20160226 (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_USBLODR.ZAHB-A):
Figure 6. USBferry attack scenario, version UF1.0 20160226
Figure 6. USBferry attack scenario, version UF1.0 20160226
1. The decoy file first drops a flash_en.inf DLL file, which is a USBferry loader, and tries to
load the encrypted USBferry malware
2. The encrypted USBferry malware is embedded in the loader resource section, and the
loader drops it into the C:\Users\Public\Documents\Flash folder and names it flash.dat
3. After the encrypted payload is loaded, the loader injects a malicious DLL into
rundll32.exe. The USBferry malware also loads a C&C configuration file and
flash_en.dat, which is also located in the C:\Users\Public\Documents\Flash
4. The USBferry malware then tries to connect to the download site and uses a Windows
command to collect/copy target host data
This version checks for network connectivity; if it finds that the network is unavailable, it tries
to collect information from the target machine and copy the collected data into USB storage.
This way, the USB exfiltrates the information and sends it back to the C&C server.

Backdoors and other tools used by Tropic Trooper
Some backdoors used by Tropic Trooper use injection to execute its routines, while others
execute directly and run itself consistently. The group also uses steganography to mask their
backdoor routines and evade anti-malware and network perimeter detection. To find the full
list of the backdoors we analyzed, check out our technical brief. Here we will tackle some of
the noteworthy backdoors Tropic Trooper used.

WelCome To Svchost 3.2 20110818’s backdoor (detected as
BKDR_SVCSHELL.ZAHC-A) - This backdoor bears similarities with a payload we
discussed in our previous research. Based on the malware version number, this
backdoor’s first version was developed in or before 2011. This means that Tropic
Trooper’s activities have been ongoing for at least ten years now.

Figure 7. The backdoor version name, registered service name, and malware components’
filenames
Welcome To IDShell 1.0 20150310’s backdoor (detected as BKDR_IDSHELL.ZTFCA) - The purpose of this backdoor, which has two types, including a steganography jpg
version, is to recon the target machine. Like other versions, it uses the DNS protocol to
communicate with the backdoor controller. The traffic is encrypted to evade detection.

Figure 8. The backdoor’s communication traffic
Hey! Welcome Server 2.0’s backdoor (detected as BKDR_TEBSHELL.ZTGK) – This
is the latest version of the backdoor, available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, which uses
an invisible web shell for remote control and network security evasion. It runs the
process as a service, hides backdoor communication in normal traffic, and uses
customized TCP protocol. It also improves the way it handles wrong input commands
and unauthorized access.
Figure 9. The executable version will install and name it as a Windows service, change
registry to disable error display, and launch the service

registry to disable error display, and launch the service
Tropic Trooper also used other tools in their attacks, such as:
Command-line remote control listener/port relay tool, which has different versions that
can communicate with the backdoor.
Backdoor payload/steganography payload execution loaders, which have two versions
that can be used to successfully load the encrypted payload and subsequently delete
itself and the payload.
Port scanning tools, which are available on the internet.
The overview provided above highlights how putting critical information in physically isolated
networks is not a bulletproof solution for defending against cyberespionage. Steganography
isn’t just used to deliver encrypted payloads; it can also be used to transfer information to a

C&C server. Multiple hacking tools and components can also help facilitate successful
attacks on different networks and environments. Threat actors like Tropic Trooper can also
use an invisible web shell to hide its C&C server location and make incident response tricky.

Best practices and Trend Micro solutions
The latest developments with Tropic Trooper indicate that they are well-prepared to target
government institutions and military agencies for stolen intelligence. The group also takes a
long time to perform reconnaissance and consequently infiltrate physically isolated networks.
This research also underscores how threat actors could see potentially vulnerable targets as
launch points for extending their attack attempts to other, more critical targets.
Understanding attack tactics and techniques can provide the needed context for assessing
potential impact and adopting defensive strategies. Here are some measures that
organizations can practice to thwart advanced persistent threats with security that employs
actionable threat intelligence, network-wide visibility, and timely threat protection:
Enforce the principle of least privilege. Employ network segmentation and data
categorization to deter lateral movement and mitigate exposure.
Keep the system and its applications up-to-date. Weaknesses in the network can
serve as entry points for attacks. Enforce a strong patch management policy and
consider virtual patching for legacy systems.
Regularly monitor your perimeter. Adopt cross-layer detection and response across
gateways, endpoints, networks, and servers to protect against a wide range of
cybersecurity threats. Firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems can
help defend against network-based attacks.
Organizations can take advantage of the Trend Micro Apex One™ solution, which provides
actionable insights, expanded investigative capabilities, and centralized visibility across the
network through a variety of threat detection capabilities such as behavioral analysis that
protects against malicious scripts, injection, ransomware, memory, and browser attacks.
A multilayered security solution such as Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ can also be
considered; it provides in-depth analysis and proactive response to attacks using exploits
and other similar threats through specialized engines, custom sandboxing, and seamless
correlation across the entire attack lifecycle, allowing it to detect these attacks even without
any engine or pattern updates.
