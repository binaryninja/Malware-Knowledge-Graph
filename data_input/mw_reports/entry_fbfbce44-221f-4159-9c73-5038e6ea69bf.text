Russian State-Sponsored Actors Exploiting Vulnerability in
VMware® Workspace ONE Access Using Compromised
Credentials
Summary
Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors are exploiting a vulnerability in VMware®1 Access and VMware Identity
Manager2 products [1], allowing the actors access to protected data and abusing federated authentication. VMware
released a patch for the Command Injection Vulnerability captured in CVE-2020-4006 on December 3rd 2020. NSA
encourages National Security System (NSS), Department of Defense (DoD), and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) network
administrators to prioritize mitigation of the vulnerability on affected servers.
Password-based access to the web-based management interface of the device is required to exploit the vulnerability, so
using a strong and unique password lowers the risk of exploitation. The risk is lowered further if the web-based
management interface is not accessible from Internet. The vulnerability affects the following products [2]:







VMware Access®3 20.01 and 20.10 on Linux®4
VMware vIDM®5 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 3.3.3 on Linux
VMware vIDM Connector 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 19.03
VMware Cloud Foundation®6 4.x
VMware vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager®7 8.x

The exploitation (T11908) via command injection (T1059) led to installation of a web shell (T1505.003) and follow-on
malicious activity where credentials in the form of SAML authentication assertions were generated and sent to Microsoft®9
Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) (T1212), which in turn granted the actors access to protected data (TA0009).
It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are
properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to
numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsoft’s best
practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication [3] [4].

Mitigation Actions
Patch
Update affected systems to the latest version as soon as possible according to VMware’s instructions at KB81754 [1] [5].
Review and harden configurations and monitoring of federated authentication providers.

Russian State-Sponsored Actors Exploiting Vulnerability in VMware®
Workspace ONE Access Using Compromised Credentials
Workaround
According to VMware’s Knowledge Base article KB81731, critical portions of this activity can be blocked by disabling the
configurator service using the following procedures for Linux-based appliances [6]:
1. Use ssh to connect to the appliance using “sshuser” credentials configured during installation or when updated
later.
2. Switch to root by typing su and provide “root” credentials configured during installation or when updated later.
3. Run the following commands:
cd /opt/vmware/horizon/workspace
mkdir webapps.tmp
mv conf/Catalina/localhost/cfg.xml webapps.tmp
service horizon-workspace restart
4. Repeat steps for all Linux-based appliances affected by CVE-2020-4006.
For Windows-based servers:
1. Log in as Administrator.
2. Open a Command Prompt window and run the following commands:
net stop “VMwareIDMConnector”
cd \VMware\VMwareIdentityManager\Connector\opt\vmware\horizon\workspace
mkdir webappstmp
move webapps\cfg webappstmp
move conf\Catalina\localhost\cfg.xml webappstmp
net start “VMwareIDMConnector”
3. Repeat steps for all Windows-based servers affected by CVE-2020-4006.
VMware’s KB81731 lists steps to revert the workaround if needed.
This workaround should only be a temporary fix until able to fully patch the system. In addition, review and harden
configurations and monitoring of federated authentication providers.

Detection
Network-based indicators are unlikely to be effective at detecting exploitation since the activity occurs exclusively inside
an encrypted transport layer security (TLS) tunnel associated with the web interface. However, indications of this activity
may be caught in server logs. The presence of an “exit” statement followed by any 3-digit number, such as “exit 123”,
within the configurator.log would suggest that exploitation activity may have occurred on the system. This log can be
found at /opt/vmware/horizon/workspace/logs/configurator.log on the server. Other commands along with encoded scripts
may also be present. If such logs are detected, incident response actions should be followed. Additional investigation of
the server, especially for web shell malware, is recommended (see the NSA CSI “Detect and Prevent Web Shell Malware”
[7]).
Regularly monitor authentication logs for anomalous authentications, especially successful ones that leverage established
trusts but that come from unusual addresses or contain unusual properties.

Further Guidance
Exploiting the vulnerability requires authenticated password-based access to the management interface of the device,
which is encrypted with TLS. That interface typically runs over port 8443, but it could be over any user-defined port. NSA
recommends that NSS, DoD, and DIB network administrators limit the accessibility of the management interface on
servers to only a small set of known systems and block it from direct Internet access (see “Performing Out-of-Band
Management” [8]).
Since the server requires that passwords be intentionally chosen upon installation, there are no known default passwords.
Setting the password to a strong unique password would make it more difficult to exploit, but would likely not mitigate an
existing compromise.
It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are
properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to
numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsoft’s best
practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication [3] [4].
