Since the December 8 FireEye announcement of an internal breach, the cybersecurity
world has been beset by breaking information providing new parts to the evolving story that
has affected many companies and government organizations. Today, it appears that the
supply chain breach of SolarWinds is perhaps one of the largest and most sophisticated
cyber intrusions ever. As 2021 begins, we find ourselves already wanting to know how we,
as cyber intelligence providers, can learn from this breach and better communicate about
cyber threats to our customers?
Background

As has been widely reported, it appears that SolarWinds was the initial point of compromise
for FireEye and other organizations worldwide, including local and federal government
agencies, information and communications technology companies, health-related and
pharmaceutical organizations, and educational entities worldwide. However, as new
information continues to come to light, researchers have identified likely additional infection
vectors used by the same actor.

This breach is remarkable for its complexity, its targeting of U.S. national security interests,
and the breadth of potential targets. The malware used is highly advanced and welldisguised with defense evasion features. Although many suspect it to be of Russian origin,
to date no cyber security vendor has definitively linked the malware to a known group or
previously identified malware family. Using a supply chain vendor to infect tertiary victims at
scale is an increasingly popular tactic amongst advanced threat actors, with some of the
most high-profile supply chain attacks including the ASUS compromise, CCleaner supply
chain attack, NotPetya attack, amongst others.
What does this breach mean for cyber threat intelligence (CTI)?

The technological sophistication and the potentially enormous reach of the supply-chain
tactic make the SolarWinds breach truly an industry-changing hack. Breaches this large can
serve as a catalyst for change, and signs of change can already be seen in the way CTI
practitioners communicate to stakeholders and customers. Specifically, this compromise
has brought more teamwork across the cyber threat intel field, more sharing of behavior
analytics, and a level of comfort with reporting even in the absence of definitive attribution.

Perhaps the most overdue change is for CTI to move away from sharing solely
indicators of compromise (IOCs) to sharing behavior analytics.
<<< End >>>
These changes, some overdue, will help CTI analysts become more agile and effective at
communicating intelligence with our customers in five ways:
1. Ensure proactive threat hunting and integration with endpoint detection and
response (EDR) services to inform the analytic process and include threat hunting
behavior analytics in the final product.
2. Fuse intelligence into incident response procedures to advise and identify the
most damaging threats, vulnerabilities, and active compromises in victim networks
and, conversely, feed incident response data into threat intelligence platforms to
inform wider compromise implications.
3. Increase timeliness in reporting so customers can stay ahead of the game.
Reducing the requirement to attribute threat activity, while also working more closely
with intelligence partners will shorten the analytic production timeline.
4. Understand the full attacker lifecycle by ensuring that threat investigators place
equal effort in pinpointing the initial attack vector as they place in malware
identification and remediation.

5. Expand the CTI customer base by demonstrating that threat intelligence can benefit
governance, risk, and compliance offices and acquisition units within organizations in
addition to their IT departments. Companies can deter and quickly mitigate cyber
threats, particularly supply chain attacks, with a whole-of-business awareness of the
threats and required responses.
Behavior analytic sharing

Perhaps the most overdue change is for CTI to move away from sharing solely indicators of
compromise (IOCs) to sharing behavior analytics. As observed in some of the leading
analysis by FireEye, Microsoft, and others, intelligence vendors are sharing behavior
detections. Monitoring for threat activity solely based on IOCs fails to detect novel
campaigns such as the SolarWinds supply chain breaches.
Behavioral analytics speaks to the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
and is the most difficult for a threat actor to change from one victim to the next. Thus, they
appear at the highest level of the Pyramid of Pain hierarchy conceptualized by David J.
Bianco. In contrast, threat actors can easily change the hash values of their malware and
can vary their C2 infrastructure making it difficult for defenders to stay ahead of their antics
if only monitoring for IOCs. For example, within the SolarWinds investigation, Accenture CTI
has observed several different hash values of the TEARDROP malware where the malware
code was identical except some samples had null bytes added into the code, demonstrating
how easily threat actors can change these indicators.
At a level of abstraction above IOCs, threat actors can change their toolset, which is more
difficult to do but will stave off defenders looking for tool reuse. Despite this, there are often
similar artifacts between tools that allow researchers to attribute it.
Pushing the CTI industry towards sharing actionable detection opportunities based on
attacker TTPs is a more resilient approach to detecting advanced attackers.

T.E.A.M. (together everyone achieves more)

The SolarWinds breach exemplifies the benefit of intelligence sharing and building industry
partnerships. Beginning with the initial announcement by FireEye and followed quickly by
blogs by Microsoft and others, public and private entities were teaming together to identify
and disrupt the breach.
These partnerships go beyond what has been publicly disclosed, with intelligence sharing
conversations amongst stakeholders throughout the industry happening daily. Formal
partnerships and informal partnerships have ensured customers are getting the latest
intelligence and indicators of compromise. These partnerships are evident in the constant
flow of security vendor blogs – each adding a piece to the puzzle. Intelligence partnering
and transparent information sharing is demonstrating that the cyber defense industry is
greater than the sum of its parts.
Within organizations, teamwork across multiple teams – from CTI, to Incident Response, to
endpoint detection and response (EDR) services – is enabling cyber threat analysts to
provide customers with timely and actionable intelligence. Building upon the behavior
analytics sharing, practitioners can recommend immediate actions that customers can take
to mitigate and begin to remediate the risk. Within Accenture, we take a team approach to
providing mitigations – giving organizations short-, medium-, and long-term suggestions
aimed at benefitting our customers’ governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), IT, and
acquisition departments.

A change to attribution

A final insight of the SolarWinds response is a move away from definitively attributing the
compromise to a known threat group prior to reporting on it. Eliminating the requirement to
attribute threat activity allows intelligence analysts to get the vital information into
stakeholders’ hands as quickly as possible. Analysts can focus on getting technical details
with concrete detection or mitigation recommendations out quickly while spending
dedicated time after the initial publication on determining attribution.
In the past, CTI has largely focused on grouping threat activity and attributing it to a specific
known nation-state or defined espionage or criminal threat group. However, attribution to an
identifiable group is increasingly difficult.
With the commodification of tools, more and more groups are using the same tools whether open-source tools or utilities inherent to the operating system. Threat actors,
particularly advanced actors, are also more deftly removing signs of their custom malware
and presence in a network. This makes it difficult to track a threat group by, for example,
using the same custom tool across campaigns. On the other hand, individual developers
likely take their tools with them as they change teams or may work as contractors to
multiple teams, so CTI researchers can find the same tool or code overlap across multiple
groups, making it difficult to distinguish the unique group attribution.
The cyber security vendor reporting related to the SolarWinds breach is proving that CTI
teams can share quality threat intelligence without having direct attribution to a known,
attributed threat group. Perhaps this breach will disrupt the way that CTI has adhered to
attribution, instead moving intelligence past group attribution to a discussion of novel tactics
and behaviors with attribution limited to the state level, rather than to specific groups.
Conclusion

As CTI teams change how they communicate intelligence to customers, the teams should
also change how they collect and monitor intelligence. Instead of building intelligence
requirements based on threat groups, we will define our requirements based on known
malicious behaviors -- looking for evidence of a compromise through defined malicious
TTPs. Identifying attacker behavior patterns allow threat hunters to track cyber attackers
regardless of whether they change their tooling or infrastructure.
CTI teams monitor passive external sources as well as current triggering geopolitical events
to preempt threat actor activities, fusing and contextualizing data to pass to customers to
help protect their networks. Keeping a constant awareness of the most pressing issues and
iteratively adjusting our collection and priorities keeps CTI at the forefront of new threat
actor developments.
