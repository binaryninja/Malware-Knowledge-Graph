MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 iii

About this report
The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) focuses on software
vulnerabilities, software vulnerability exploits, malware, and unwanted software.
Past reports and related resources are available for download at
www.microsoft.com/sir. We hope that readers find the data, insights, and
guidance provided in this report useful in helping them protect their
organizations, software, and users.
Reporting period
This volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report focuses on the first and
second quarters of 2016, with trend data for the last several quarters presented
on a quarterly basis. Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent
from quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of
the year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly
basis.
Throughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced
using the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n
indicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H16 represents the first half of 2016
(January 1 through June 30), and 4Q15 represents the fourth quarter of 2015
(October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting
period or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report.
Conventions
This report uses the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming
standard for families and variants of malware. For information about this
standard, see “Appendix A: Threat naming conventions” on page 135 of the full
report. In this report, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique
base name is considered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration
includes threats that may not otherwise be considered families according to
common industry practices, such as generic and cloud-based detections. For
the purposes of this report, a threat is defined as a malicious or unwanted
software family or variant that is detected by the Microsoft Malware Protection
Engine.

iv ABOUT THIS REPORT

How to use this report
The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report has been released twice a year since
2006. Each volume is based upon data collected from millions of computers all
over the world, which not only provides valuable insights on the worldwide
threat landscape, both at home and at work, but also provides detailed
information about threat profiles faced by computer users in more than a
hundred individual countries and regions.
To get the most out of each volume, Microsoft recommends the following:
Read
Each volume of the report consists of several parts. The primary report typically
consists of a worldwide threat assessment, one or more feature articles,
guidance for mitigating risk, and some supplemental information. A summary of
the key findings in the report can be downloaded and reviewed separately from
the full report; it highlights a number of facts and subjects that are likely to be of
particular interest to readers. The regional threat assessment, available for
download and in interactive form at www.microsoft.com/security/sir/threat,
provides individual summaries of threat statistics and security trends for more
than 100 countries and regions worldwide.
Reading the volume in its entirety will provide readers with the most benefit and
context, but the report is designed to provide value in small doses as well. Take
a few minutes to review the summary information to find the information that
will be of most interest to you and your organization. Consult the table of
contents and the index to learn more about particular topics of interest.
Share
Microsoft also encourages readers to share each released volume, or its
download link, with co-workers, peers, and friends with similar interests. The
Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is written to be useful and accessible to a
wide range of audiences. Each volume contains thousands of hours of research
disseminated in easy to understand language, with advanced technical jargon
kept to a minimum. Each section and article is written and reviewed to provide
the most value for the time it takes to read.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 v

Assess your own risk
Reading about the threats and risks that affect different types of environments
presents a good opportunity to assess your own risks. Not every computer and
entity faces the same risk from all threats. Assess your own risks and determine
which topics and information can help you to best defend against the most
significant risks.
The volume and scope of threats facing the typical organization make it
important to prioritize. The greatest risk to any computer or organization is
posed by currently and recently active threats. Pay attention to the threats that
have most commonly affected your region or industry, focusing particularly on
the most common successful attacks in the wild that cause the most problems.
Give less consideration to very rare or theoretical-only attacks, unless your
computers are at particular risk for such threats.
Educate
Microsoft strives to make this report one of the most valuable sources of threat
and mitigation information that you can read and share. We encourage you to
use the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report as a guide to educate your
employees, friends, and families about security-related topics.

20 HOW TO USE THIS REPORT

PROMETHIUM and
NEODYMIUM: Parallel zeroday attacks targeting
individuals in Europe
Windows Defender ATP
Microsoft proactively monitors the threat landscape for emerging threats. Part
of this job involves observing the activities of targeted activity groups, which are
often the first ones to introduce new exploits and techniques that are later used
by other attackers. The previous two volumes of the Microsoft Security
Intelligence Report explored the activities of two such groups, code-named
STRONTIUM and PLATINUM, which used previously unknown vulnerabilities and
aggressive, persistent techniques to target specific individuals and institutions—
often including military installations, intelligence agencies, and other
government bodies.
This volume chronicles two activity groups, code-named PROMETHIUM and
NEODYMIUM, both of which target individuals in a specific area of Europe.
Although most malware today either seeks monetary gain or conducts
espionage for economic advantage, both of these activity groups appear to
seek information about specific individuals.
In May 2016, both PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM were observed to launch
attack campaigns. These campaigns used completely distinct infrastructure and
primary malware, which indicated a lack of association at the operational level.
However, the similarity in the campaigns’ victim locale, timing, and use of the
same zero-day exploit prior to public disclosure strongly indicates that the
activity groups may be related at a higher organizational tier.
Microsoft is sharing information about these groups to raise awareness of their
activities, and to help individuals and organizations implement existing
mitigation options that significantly reduce risk from these attack groups and
other similar groups.
MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 21

Activity Group Profile: PROMETHIUM
Campaign summary: PROMETHIUM is an activity group that has been active
since at least 2012. In 2016, an attack campaign by this group was recorded in
early May that made use of an exploit for CVE-2016-4117, a vulnerability in
Adobe Flash Player, which at the time was both unknown and unpatched.
Adobe promptly and publicly acknowledged the zero-day vulnerability and
pushed a security update.

PROMETHIUM and
NEODYMIUM both
target individuals
in a specific area of
Europe.

The attack itself began with certain individuals receiving links in
instant messenger clients. These links led to malicious
documents that invoked exploit code and eventually executed a
piece of malware called Truvasys on unsuspecting victims’
computers.

Administrators and users wondering whether they were
targeted by PROMETHIUM can scan their network by using the
indicators listed in the appendix, by using Windows Defender to
examine their logs for “Truvasys,” or by searching for PROMETHIUM in their
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection product console alerts.
Attack details: Truvasys has been previously documented by peer organizations
in the security industry. The malware and its developers have been active for a
few years and have conducted multiple attack campaigns by masquerading as
common computer utilities such as WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, and SanDisk.
In each of the campaigns, the Truvasys malware was updated to include
additional features, showing close collaboration between the activity groups
behind the campaigns and the developers of the malware.
Truvasys is a collection of modules written in the Delphi programming language,
a variant of Pascal. It runs on 32-bit and 64-bit editions of multiple versions of
Windows, including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10, in
both standard user and administrator modes. It includes a number of features
designed to evade detection, including virtual environment detection and
tampering with security software.
Truvasys connects to a remote command and control (C&C) server to retrieve
instructions from an attacker, who can use the malware to execute arbitrary
functionality on the compromised computer.

22 PROMETHIUM AND NEODYMIUM: PARALLEL ZERO-DAY ATTACKS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE

This malware family has targeted individuals through the combined use of spear
phishing and watering hole techniques for a number of years. In most cases,
Truvasys is embedded with legitimate installers of applications, compromising
individual computers by tricking users into running the installers. One campaign
involved a fake Adobe Flash Player installer, with a social engineering lure in
Turkish.
Figure 1. In one campaign, Truvasys was distributed via social engineering lures in the Turkish language

The language used in this example is consistent with the geography of Truvasys
victims, as observed over the years. Most Truvasys activities have been observed
across western Europe with a large majority of computers using the Turkish
locale setting, which suggests that most of them are Turkish citizens or
expatriates.
While studying Truvasys, Microsoft uncovered a previously undocumented
piece of malware known as Myntor that is a completely separate malware family.
Myntor is pushed onto victims’ computers that are selected by an unknown logic
devised by PROMETHIUM.
Activity Group Profile: NEODYMIUM
Campaign summary: NEODYMIUM is an activity group that, like PROMETHIUM,
conducted an attack campaign in early May 2016. NEODYMIUM also used the
exact same CVE-2016-4117 exploit code that PROMETHIUM used, prior to public
knowledge of the vulnerability’s existence.
MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 23

NEODYMIUM used a backdoor detected by Windows Defender as Wingbird,
whose characteristics closely match FinFisher, a government-grade commercial
surveillance package. Data about Wingbird activity indicates that it is typically
used to attack individuals and individual computers instead of networks.
Administrators and users wondering whether they were targeted by
NEODYMIUM can scan their networks by using the indicators listed in the
appendix, by using Windows Defender to examine their logs for “Wingbird,” or
by searching for NEODYMIUM in their Windows Defender Advanced Threat
Protection product console alerts.
Attack details: Target individuals were sent customized spear phishing emails.
An image of one such customized email from this campaign is shown in the
following figure.
Figure 2. The spear phishing campaign that NEODYMIUM launched in May 2016 is highly customized to target individuals; a large
portion of the email has been redacted to protect the privacy of the targeted individual, which shows the extent of personalization of
the malicious email

When the user opened the attachment, a blank document displayed. In the
background, a series of events, including the use of the CVE-2016-4117 zero-day
exploit, ultimately led to the download and execution of a backdoor. The exploit
code executes only if the Microsoft Office Protected View setting is turned off.
By default, documents opened from the Internet (using web browsers or email
clients) are opened in protected view mode, which prevents execution of
embedded objects and potentially malicious code.

24 PROMETHIUM AND NEODYMIUM: PARALLEL ZERO-DAY ATTACKS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE

Figure 3. The NEODYMIUM attack chain shows how the exploit CVE-2016-4117 was used to infect target individuals’ computers

The backdoor payload showed behavior that matched publicly documented
traits of a program called FinFisher, a government-grade commercial
surveillance package marketed to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
The publisher, FinFisher GmbH, claims that it sells the software exclusively to
government agencies for use in targeted and lawful criminal investigations. It is
likely that the backdoor payload is a relatively new version of the commercial
spyware.
The apparent use of a version of FinFisher suggests that the exploit and the
spear fishing campaign that delivered it were the work of an attack group
probably connected in some way to a state actor.
Windows Defender detects the backdoor payload as Wingbird. Visibility into the
usage of Wingbird shows it has been used only against individuals, not against
computers that are part of an organization’s network.
Research into Wingbird from May through November 2016 showed only tens of
victims, predominantly in Turkey.

Like Truvasys, Wingbird is designed to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows
platforms. The malware is a native 32-bit PE executable that installs a number of
additional executables and files. These components are all embedded within the
dropper itself, which allows the malware to avoid downloading components and
consequently attracting attention.
After the backdoor executes, the malware checks the underlying operating
system version and, depending on what platform it is running on, drops several
files to %ProgramData%\RpcSrv (on 32-bit computers) or
%ProgramData%\AuditService (on 64-bit computers).
In addition, on 64-bit computers the dropper creates a secondary native 64-bit
payload executable, referred to in the following diagram as [Payload64].exe. The
32-bit processes are isolated from 64-bit processes and restricted in the actions
they can perform. By providing a separate 64-bit payload, Wingbird attempts to
inject code into 64-bit processes as well as 32-bit processes.

26 PROMETHIUM AND NEODYMIUM: PARALLEL ZERO-DAY ATTACKS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE

Figure 5. Wingbird behaves differently on 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers

The main goal of the original dropper is to indirectly deliver executables by
injecting malicious code and data into two Windows system processes,
Services.exe and Winlogon.exe. The primary Wingbird payload uses anti-VM,
anti-debugging, and anti-AV mechanisms to evade discovery and analysis.
On 32-bit computers, the original dropper creates three files, as shown in Figure
5. Of the three files, the only true binary is rpcsrv.dat, a kernel rootkit that
enables the attacker to load and run privileged unsigned code. The other two
files, installer.cab and the randomly named [xxxxx].cab, are encrypted data files.
Wingbird attempts to detect and evade security products. For example, some of
the strings found in running processes, such as avcuf32.dll and <un-wnd%.08x>, indicate that the malware checks for the presence of one of several
versions of Bitdefender security software.
Through a series of actions and code injections, the original malware installs the
rootkit driver, rpcsrv.dat, a non-standard kernel driver. The attackers know that
64-bit computers are much more secure because they prevent loading of
unsigned drivers, so they do not even attempt this technique on 64-bit systems.
The malware searches for a file called ico_ty23.ico, which is publicly documented
as the filename one of the key user mode DLL components of FinFisher.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 27

On 64-bit computers, the installation of Wingbird is a lot more complicated. The
64-bit version of the original payload creates a new folder,
%ProgramData%\AuditService, and copies the Windows system file lsass.exe
from %SystemFolder% into the new folder. At the same time, the payload drops
a malicious file known as sspisrv.dll alongside the copy of lsass.exe. This
sspisrv.dll file shares its name with a code library that implements several APIs
that lsass.exe is designed to import.

The original 32-bit dropper continues monitoring until the folder and file are
created. After the 64-bit payload is done copying files, its parent process (the
32-bit dropper) deletes it. The parent process then deletes itself as an attempt to
hide its tracks and prevent analysis by security professionals.
The 64-bit malware then injects code into services.exe, the Service Control
Manager, to register a service using a clean lsass.exe that would load the
malicious sspisrv.dll, which would then inject malicious code into svchost.exe.
The constant delegation of malicious code control from one process to the next
is a way to hide execution of unwanted code and make it extremely difficult to
detect the presence of Wingbird.
This version of Wingbird has also been observed with the ability to execute
highly privileged kernel code by injecting code through vulnerable signed

28 PROMETHIUM AND NEODYMIUM: PARALLEL ZERO-DAY ATTACKS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE

drivers. It maintains a list of legitimate yet vulnerable drivers that can be
exploited to inject and execute kernel code.
It appears that Wingbird obfuscates its code at source level, rather than binary
level, to evade analysis tools and security solutions.
Similar to the 32-bit version, this version of Wingbird performs a check for a file
named ico_sf46.ico, which is a known component of FinFisher.
Mitigation
Stopping zero-day exploits in Windows 10
PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM both used a zero-day

vulnerabilities. The Flash vulnerability CVE-2016-4117 is a type
confusion vulnerability in the DeleteRangeTimelineOperation
class. The referenced exploit only reliably works on specific Windows platforms
because of a ByteArray mitigation in Flash Player, which causes Microsoft to
believe that the exploit was authored with pre-knowledge of the victim’s
computer information. The exploit uses the Adobe Flash Player’s Function object
vftable corruption method to achieve code execution.
Because 64-bit versions of Windows 10 enforce driver signing, malicious code
that attempts to load a locally made, untrusted driver will be stopped in its
tracks.
In addition, the technique of using lsass.exe to load a malicious DLL files can be
mitigated by an optional feature introduced in Windows 10 called Credential
Guard. Microsoft highly recommends that network administrators test and
enable this feature. In Wingbird’s case, the malicious sspisrv.dll will not load
because it wasn’t signed by a trusted certificate.
The Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI) service enables the Device Guard feature
in Windows 10 to help protect kernel mode processes and drivers from

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 29

vulnerability exploits and zero-day exploits. HVCI uses the processor’s
functionality to force all software running in kernel mode to safely allocate
memory, which means that after memory has been allocated, its state must be
changed from writable to read-only or execute-only. By forcing memory into
these states, HVCI helps ensure that attacks are unable to inject malicious code
into kernel mode processes and drivers through techniques such as buffer
overflows and heap spraying.
Detecting malicious behavior with Windows Defender Advanced Threat
Protection
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a new built-in detection
service that ships natively with Windows 10 and helps enterprises to detect
targeted and advanced attacks. When activated, it captures behavioral signals
from the endpoint and then uses cloud-based security machine learning
analytics and threat intelligence to flag suspicious attack-related activities.
The NEODYMIUM attack campaign executed the following five malicious
behaviors, all of whichare detected by Windows Defender ATP:
1.

Zero-day exploit code causes a Microsoft Office file to generate and open
an executable file.

Figure 7. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for an exploit resulting in a malicious file executing on an endpoint

2. Zero-day exploit code allows an executable file to gain higher privileges.
3. A suspicious file self-deletes, a behavior associated with malware that erases
traces of infection as a way to evade forensic analysis.

30 PROMETHIUM AND NEODYMIUM: PARALLEL ZERO-DAY ATTACKS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE

Figure 8. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for processes that attempt self-deletion

4. Malware executes DLL-side loading, a technique in which attackers replace
legitimate DLL files in non-standard folders with malicious ones so that the
malicious file is loaded when the application or operating system starts.
Figure 9. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for DLL-side loading

5. Malware injects code into legitimate processes, which is usually done to load
the malware when system processes run.
Figure 10. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for suspicious code injections

Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection alerts enterprise security teams
of detections and allows them to investigate and respond to each security
incident in a timely and effective manner. The service complements and works
MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016 31

along with Windows Defender or third-party antivirus security solutions.
Additional information about the service is available here.
Summary
In May 2016, two apparently unrelated activity groups, PROMETHIUM and
NEODYMIUM, conducted attack campaigns in Europe that used the same zeroday exploit while the vulnerability was publicly unknown. Although the use of the
same exploit code could be attributed to a number of coincidences, the timing
of the campaigns and victim demographics lend credence to the theory that the
campaigns were associated.
One threat family, Wingbird, appears to be a version of a commercially available
tool sold to organizations conducting lawful interception. Wingbird is a fairly
advanced threat family that must have required the authors several months’
worth of man-hours to generate. Even so, Wingbird as-is does not execute in
Windows 10.
Each activity group uses a unique set of tools and methods to perform actions
like lateral movement and data exfiltration. One of the purposes of tracking
activity groups is to research unique attacker techniques and to develop
mitigations for the native operating system. Microsoft has built proactive
security mitigations into its products, which increases the investment barrier for
attackers who try to victimize users of the latest versions of Windows.
The Windows security service Windows Defender ATP provides an additional
post-breach layer of security to enterprises organizations. As this article shows,
proactive mitigation in Windows 10 and Office on 64-bit systems does not allow
the exploit vector for these two attack campaigns or the exploitation of kernel
drivers to succeed. In addition, Windows Defender ATP detects suspicious
events on endpoints, alerts security operators about undesired activities, and
provides the required tool to respond.
Indicators
