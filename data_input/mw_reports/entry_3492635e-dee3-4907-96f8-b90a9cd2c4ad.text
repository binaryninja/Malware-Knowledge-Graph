state connection?

In the absence of more concrete proof, the 2017 Cloud Hopper report on APT10 relied on
timing analysis to make the connection to China. Compile times of executable files and
registration times of domains all pointed to work undertaken between 9am and 5pm Beijing
time.
If Zheng Yanbin, Gao Qiang and Zhang Shilong were working between 9am and 5pm and
managed to orchestrate one of the largest Cyber attacks on western infrastructure of all time,
it follows that any company for whom they were working would probably have been involved
in the operation.
Laoying Baichaun Instruments Equipment Co Ltd
The first company identified in our article on Gao Qiang was Laoying Baichaun Instruments
Equipment Co Ltd. It was associated with fisherxp via his name, phone number and the
postcode registered to fisherx[.]com, and less conclusively to Zhang Shilong via the photo he
took from a building nearby on Xinkai Road. The company has offices in Tianjin and appears
to still operate, making sales online.

Tianjin Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co Ltd
The second company identified was the Tianjin Huaying Haitai Science and Technology
Development Co Ltd (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司). It was associated with fisherxp via a
job advert placed in his name. Huaying Haitai has an entry in several online Chinese
company registration databases.

Sun Jie (孙杰) who owns 30%.

Another individual named Feng Tao is also associated with the company, listed as a
manager in some databases.
The company is headquartered in Tianjin at the Fuyu Plaza building on Jiefang South Road
in the Hexi district (天津市河西区解放南路中段西侧富裕大厦1-1906).
Company information online shows that the company has previously had a website –
huayinghaitai[.]com – though there is no trace of it ever having had any content

The site shown above includes a company profile that loosely translates as:

Association with the state?
Having identified two companies at one time connected to at least one APT10 hacker, the
question remains – were they hacking on behalf of the Chinese state? Huaying Haitai is a
small company with two shareholders and, for a Cyber security company, a very small web
presence. The situation bears more than a striking resemblance to Boyusec, a company
used as cover for APT3 activity by the Chinese Ministry of State Security.
This blog believes that it has proof of links between the APT10 actors named in our research
and the Chinese state, but our analysts are keen to corroborate it before publishing. If you
are a Cyber Threat Intelligence analyst and have information that could help us
confirm the link between Zheng Yanbin, Gao Qiang, Zhang Shilong, Laoying Baichaun
or Huaying Haitai and the Chinese state, please contact us.
