Threat Hunting for REvil Ransomware

Summary
REvil (short for Ransomware Evil and also referred to as Sodinokibi) ransomware is in the
ransomware-as-a-service(RaaS) business. The malware is handed over to the affiliates to
infect users and extort money. In turn the original REvil developers take 20-30% of the
amount that the affiliates receive. The ransomware developers say that they have made
more than $100 million in one year by infecting users owning large businesses. Attacks
attributed to REvil were first spotted in April 2019, soon after the shutdown of the Gandcrab
ransomware family. In fact, the developers of REvil have admitted that they did not build from
scratch, but instead used the Grandcrab code base. In this post we describe how security
operations teams can hunt for REvil ransomware and the artifacts it produces / leaves
behind.

Understanding REvil

To encrypt files, REvil uses elliptic curve cryptography(ECC). This allows smaller keys
compared to other approaches without compromising on effectiveness of the encryption .
Since its first appearance, this ransomware family has exploited vulnerabilities in software

such as Windows Servers like 2012, 2012 R2 etc, as well as more recently Remote Desktop
Gateway (RD Gateway).

The configuration that the malware reads is a JSON file and it is stored in a special section of
the malware binary called .iyaw in this case (Figure 3). The name changes with every new
sample and the configuration is RC4 encrypted.

The configuration defines the files to be excluded from encryption as well as the ransom note
to be displayed. The sample configuration after being decrypted is shown in Figure 4.

After encryption the wallpaper changes (Figure 5) to display that all files have been
encrypted and all the instructions are in a text file (Figure 6).

Process Cooldown
The configuration file (Figure 4) contains prc and svc fields which are process names and
services that would be killed before the encryption process begins. REvil also deletes
Volume Shadow Copies (VSS) using the PowerShell command shown in Figure 7.

Decoding the command reveals the actual command (Figure 8).

Threat Hunting for REvil

With that background, how does a security analyst uncover REvil, ideally before significant
impact across the organization? After the files have been encrypted, the ransomware
reaches out to over a 1000 domains generated based on information from the configuration
file. Each URL contains the following pattern:

https://<domain>/<path1>/<path2>/<filename>.<ext>
Out of these 1000 domains, many are legitimate while others are C2 servers owned by the
REvil operators which receive information from the infected machine. This technique allows
the attackers to hide the real attacker servers. All the communication happens in TLS and
the SNI can be seen in Figure 9.

From having looked at multiple REvil samples, it appears that the TLS cipher suites (Figure
10) are always constant for any domain accessed by the ransomware.

Similarly, the TLS client extension codes also remain constant across all domains.

The fact that the TLS fields are identical across all of the REvil session can be observed
using TLS fingerprinting. This fact can be used with a technology like JA3 and can be fine
tuned for true positives by using additional analytics. Specifically, the JA3 hash of the REvil
traffic is 1d095e68489d3c535297cd8dffb06cb9. However, simply relying on this hash is
likely to lead to false positives. For instance, searching customer networks for the same JA3
hash showed some traffic that was clearly not ransomware (Figure 12).

This is where deep security analytics can help. For instance, it is possible to identify devices
within this list that have the behavior described above where thousands of different
destinations are accessed in quick succession.

Within the Awake Security Platform, Ava, performs this analysis automatically for you much
like an experienced threat hunter. For instance, Ava will automatically connect the dots
across the different behaviors we described above to triage and narrow down to just the trust
positives. Ava can also account for threat intelligence and open source intelligence indicators
to confirm the compromise and recommend next steps for investigation and response.
Finally, Ava can trigger response actions by integrating with the rest of the organizationâ€™s
security and IT infrastructure. Especially when dealing with ransomware, speed of
remediation is of the essence and the automated triage, investigation and response that Ava
brings to this process helps mitigate impact.

Remediation
It is recommended to backup all important data to external drives or in the cloud for better
security. Additionally, organizations should protect and monitor all the early vectors of
ransomware. This includes protecting email and securely working with attachments
especially from unknown sources as well as monitoring and protecting the entire attack
surface e.g. externally exposed remote desktop or VPN services etc.. Finally, identify the
sequence and patterns of communication we describe in this blog post and hunt for those to
uncover the presence of REvil on your network.
