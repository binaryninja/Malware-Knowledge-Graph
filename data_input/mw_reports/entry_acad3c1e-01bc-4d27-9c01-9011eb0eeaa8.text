Summary
On January 15, 2014, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center (DHS NCCIC) published Joint Indicators Bulletin INC-260425, which listed indicators related to two established threat
groups.
The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU™ ) research team tracks threat groups by assigning them four-digit
randomized numbers, and compiles information from external sources and from first-hand incident response observations. The
first set of indicators released by the NCCIC are associated with TG-8223, an APT group that targets the media, government,
and defense sectors. The second set of indicators released by the NCCIC originate from an intrusion by TG-2754, an APT
group that targets the technology, government, and defense sectors. The CTU research team has been tracking both of these
groups since 2006.
The majority of the released file hashes are associated with command-line file transfer and traffic proxy tools (BeepService,
ONHAT proxy, LinseningSvr, and SimpleFileMover) that accept command-line arguments for network endpoints. The
SvcInstaller tool is used to establish persistence for separate DLL files that are not included in the corpus. Some indicators
also relate to DD Keylogger, jspRAT, and ZiyangRAT, which are remote access trojans (RATs) that include remote endpoints.

Tools and usage
CTU researchers analyzed the binary files associated with the hash indicators provided by the NCCIC and determined they
were related to the following families of malware and tools:
BeepService
DD Keylogger
jspRAT
LinseningSvr
ONHAT proxy
SimpleFileMover
SvcInstaller
Ziyang RAT
Airgapped malware

Given that the indicators are from multiple incidents, it is not possible to create an accurate timeline or sequence for each tool's
usage. The following sections briefly describe each family and include indicators associated with the referenced samples.

BeepService
The BeepService family of malware is used to create a reverse shell that connects to a specific command and control (C2)
server controlled by the attacker. BeepService requires the attacker to specify the following arguments on the command line:
> malware.exe [targetIP] [C2IP] [C2port] [RC4key] [Process to inject into] [service name] [filename]

The malware is configured with default values that are overwritten by the options provided on the command line. Shellcode is
injected into the specified process on the target system. The BeepService malware does not establish persistence and does
not automatically start when the computer restarts. The specified [service name] and [filename] are for temporary use and are
both deleted after the shellcode has been injected into the configured process. The malware encrypts its communication to the
C2 server using the RC4 algorithm and the [RC4key] specified on the command line.

DD Keylogger
DD Keylogger, sometimes referred to as Toyecma, was first observed in May 2013 and was used regularly through August
2013 to target economic and monetary policy groups. This malware is distributed via spearphishing emails that contain EXE or
SCR attachments masquerading as innocuous document files. DD Keylogger can record keyboard activity on a compromised
system and then transmit that data to an attacker-controlled system. It can also download a second-stage payload typically
known as the Mswab/Aumlib RAT, which gives remote attackers complete control of a compromised system.

jspRAT
jspRAT is a JavaServer pages (JSP) web-based backdoor that can manipulate files and directories. The malware can also run
arbitrary Windows commands. jspRAT requires the victim's system to be running a JSP-enabled service such as the Apache
Tomcat open source web server. Communications take place over HTTP and may not be encrypted depending on the server's
configuration.

LinseningSvr
LinseningSvr is used to transmit arbitrary fixed-size data chunks over an unencrypted channel. It sends or receives data from a
user-specified IP address and port, in clear text. The password is obscured with an MD5 hash. The tool requires the attacker to
specify the following arguments on the command line:
> malware.exe [local port] [password]

When LinseningSvr is executed, it opens a socket on the specified port and waits for connections. When a remote user
connects, LinseningSvr reads any two bytes sent and then attempts to read from a local file named "c:\1". If this file exists,
LinseningSvr sends the hashed password and 36 bytes from the file to the remote system as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
LinseningSvr then attempts to delete the file and reports a "Deleted c:\1" message if successful. The tool requires appropriate
permissions to successfully execute the delete function. If LinseningSvr cannot delete the file, it displays a message that the
file could not be deleted. Due to a bug in the tool, the message that the file could not be deleted is followed by an inaccurate
message that the file was deleted.

Figure 1. LinseningSvr sending hashed password and 36 bytes of data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

Figure 2. System receiving hashed password and 36 bytes from LinseningSvr. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
The server also reads up to 272 bytes from the remote client. The first 16 bytes must be the same as the 16-byte hashed
password. Sent data is written to the c:\2 file. LinseningSvr then repeats a loop of sleep and continues checking for the c:\1 file.
If the bytes do not match, the message "Password is Wrong!" is printed to the server console.

ONHAT proxy
The ONHAT proxy redirects network traffic on a compromised host using SOCKS5 technology. The ONHAT proxy has similar
functionality as the HTRAN malware, although the layout of the code is slightly different. The CTU research team believes
ONHAT proxy is a variant of HTRAN.
ONHAT has no persistence functionality and is invoked by a command-line tool using arguments. If arguments are not
provided, ONHAT attempts to read stored values from environment variables. The malware stores arguments that have been
invoked from the command line in environment variables. These arguments may include port number that the proxy feature
listens on.
Internal strings and error messages frequently use the phrase "ONHAT". However, the environment variables use the phrase
"TAHNO" (ONHAT backwards) when storing settings.

SimpleFileMover
SimpleFileMover is used to transmit arbitrary files over an encrypted channel. It sends or receives a specified file to or from an
arbitrary IP address and port, encrypted with a key that is set at the command line. The following is the syntax for the
command line:
> malware.exe [destinationIP] [port #] ['p' or 'g'] [filename] [RC4key]

When the tool is invoked with the 'p' option, the malware sends a local file specified by [filename] to the remote system on the
port specified. The 'g' option retrieves a file from the remote system and saves it to [filename]. In most samples analyzed by
CTU researchers, the entire transaction is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm. The RC4 key is also specified at the command
line. One version of the analyzed samples takes only four arguments, omitting the [RC4key] option because it does not
implement crypto functions. This clear text version also produces verbose error messages.
CTU researchers have also analyzed the corresponding server component for this attack tool. The server component listens
for connections from SimpleFileMover clients and then receives or transmits files as requested by the client malware. The
following command-line syntax starts the server:
> malware.exe [port #] [RC4key]

If the listening port is not specified at the command line, the server listens by default on port 8080. If the RC4 key is omitted,
SimpleFileMover defaults to '123'.

SvcInstaller

6/10

The SvcInstaller tool can install or uninstall itself as a Windows service, and it must be run as administrator. The SvcInstaller
executable includes functionality to create a thread that loads a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) configured by the threat actor. This
DLL includes two command-line options:
-i (install service)
-u (uninstall service)

The startup type of the malicious service is set "Automatic," and the two known versions of this malicious service are named
"MSSPrv" and "UPSmgr". SvcInstaller installs either MSSPrv or UPSmgr, and the installed service attempts to masquerade as
a legitimate service by using similar display names (see Tables 8 and 9).

Ziyang RAT

7/10

The Ziyang family of malware is used to provide remote access to a compromised system. When executed, Ziyang connects to
a C2 server's domain name or IP address and port value, which have been encoded in the malware, to receive instructions and
send information. Ziyang can be used to upload, download, delete, or run files; search for files; list directory contents; and run
commands on the compromised system.
Ziyang uses a custom binary protocol to communicate with a C2 server. Packets include a 16-byte header, followed by a
compressed, encrypted payload. The header contains the following fields:
Four-byte command string XOR-encoded with 0x9862ED7A
Payload size
Random DWORD used as part of the payload crypto key
Hard-coded value from malware that may indicate a software version or specific campaign

Airgapped malware
The malware samples in this group were constructed to control systems in situations where network communications are not
possible or desired, such as an airgapped environment. Removable media transferred between compromised systems
transports specially encrypted command files and moves files and captured data between the malware's agent modules and
controller module.
One sample in this malware group, identified as the control module, monitors removable media insertion on the infected
system. The module then attempts to execute its commands to collect harvested data and queue additional tasks and files for
the agent modules. It can also selectively infect additional removable media by adding files and AutoRun configurations to the
media. This module is hard-coded to self-terminate and clean up associated files when launched after June 21, 2013, so the
specific version of this tool described in the NCCIC release is probably not on any systems running as of this publication.
The "agent" samples in this malware group are data collection and system control modules. The agent receives command files
and then executes commands associated with data collection, binary execution, and other arbitrary system commands. The
specific agent versions referenced in the NCCIC release are hard-coded to terminate and remove themselves from
compromised systems when launched after hard-coded dates. The agent module that appears to be the most current and
associated with the controller referenced in the NCCIC release has a self-termination date of May 31, 2013. The older agent
module has a self-termination date of December 30, 2012. These dates suggest that these specific modules are probably not
on any systems running as of this publication.
Agent modules can collect the following types of data:
Computer and operating system details
Network configuration
User account information
Directory listings for local and network drives on connected systems
Domain or workgroup information
Primary and backup domain controller information
Arbitrary files from local and remote systems

The modules do not contain any network indicators. These tools are most likely used in conjunction with other malware or
remote access mechanisms, or rely on physical access. CTU researchers analyzed the airgapped malware indicators in Table
