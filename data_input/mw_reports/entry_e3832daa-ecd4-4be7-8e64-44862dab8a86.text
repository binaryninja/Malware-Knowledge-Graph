What is Online Entertainment?

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Online
Entertainment
Industry Chain

Money & Gamblers
Engineers & Customer Service

- Industry Chain Worldwide (most illegal)
- Lucrative Nature

Headquarter

- Various way to “Entertain” (to game/gamble)
Board Games, Sports, Video games, lotteries…

Weaponization
&
Reconnaissance
Weaponization:
-

3 Hypotheses for Reconnaissance:
• Scenario1: Underground or secret sources

• Scenario2: Recruiting websites or forums

Mostly applying off-the-shelf
tools or modifying for
operations
Proprietary tools developed
for maintaining access or LM

• Scenario 3: Distributors
#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Phishing
Employees
-

Spear phishing employees
of targeted companies
Using daily work related
documents (web design
photos, financial
statements, pink slip) to
lure users into opening

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Phishing
Customer

-

-

Spear phishing customer
supports of the target
Complaining about
system issues and asking
supports to open
attachments to check

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Phishing
via SNP
-

-

Crafting profiles on social
network platforms, forums
Approaching sales, ITs, RDs
of targeted companies
Delivering malware by
cloud drives or custom web
servers

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Exchange server (CVE-2021-34473)
-

Using ProxyShell exploit to gain a foothold on an
exchange server

VPN Server (CVE-2018-13379)

Vulnerability

-

The actor intruded by using a Fortigate exploit to gain
VPN credentials

Browser (CVE-2021-38001)
-

The actor used watering hold attacks and hosted exploit codes
on seebug[.]updetasrvers.org

Web and NAS server vulnerabilities

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Compromised ERP System

Supply
Chain
Attack

-

first compromised ERP system of the victim via some
web vulnerability
used ERP to distribute several malware include,
CrossWalk and FunnySwitch

@BlackHatEvents

-

Lateral Movement

-

Mostly Off-the-shelf tools: Nbtscan, PsExec,
PwDumps, mimikatz
RAT harvested credentials, dictionary attacks or
exploits (e.g., EternalBlue) are used for privileges
escalation
Two stages of operations are usually adopted:
-

Stage1: automatic tools or scripts for
environment reconnaissance
Stage2: manually penetrations interleaved
with automatic tools for precise strikes

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

-

Actors created free accounts on cloud
storage platform (堅果雲, DropBox…)
Malware communicates with clouds for
concealment

Exfiltration

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Political Motivation
behind those APT?

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Should pay much attention to it because...

Money Driven

Information Collection

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Of Course !!
Based on our observation, only SLIME29 focused on financial-gain intrusion operations,
the rest all have strong political related operations.

Why the Chinese Government
Puts Significant Pressure to
Online Entertainment Industry?

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

China’s Crackdown

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Geo-politics/threat landscape
China’s crackdown on gambling
industry
• China’s crackdown on Macau gambling industry forced
gamblers to move online
• Online gambling skyrocketed during the time of pandemic
• Abundant money and data (personal info and cash flow)

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Reason I: Stability
Stop Bribery
*Anti-corruption Campaign

Clean up related Infrastructures in China

Info
collected

Take down involved companies

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Reason II: The Money

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

So how do we Mitigate such Threats?

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Countermeasures
• Isolation between Op. Dev.
and OA environment.
• Catch-up with new hacking
tools, techniques, etc..
discussed in security
community

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Countermeasures
• Patch! Patch & Patch, not
only for machines but also
humans.

• Regular drills will help.

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Countermeasures
• RATs usually support
various protocols, or
leveraging cloud platforms

• Protocols or C2 information
are seldom covered in
firewalls, IPS, IDS and AV
products

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Countermeasures
• Patch for intra-net is a
headache, but you must
• Backdoor accounts for
management is hackers’
good friends
• You need tailored and
accurate threat intelligence

#BHASIA

@BlackHatEvents

Key Takeaway:
Start the Threat Intelligence Cycle
1. China-nexus APT groups have launched massive attacks against the online
entertainment business in APAC region.
2. Dissecting the current TTPs is merely the first step.
3. China-nexus APT are closely aligned with the national interests of the
Chinese government.
