Custom ReverseWindow Android APK
u

In 2019, LuoYu actor developed an Android variant of ReverseWindow.

u

We found that the attacker disguised the apk as a popular messaging app.

u

The actor also added another custom-developed spying library to the apk.

u

Unfortunately, currently, we are unsure how the actor spread the malware.
