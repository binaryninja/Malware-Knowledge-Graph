What sort of interest would a businessman have in a news agency?
That was the question that arose from our recent investigation on an attack that appears to target a
media agency in South Korea. Shadow Force is a new backdoor that replaces a DLL called by a particular
Windows service. Once that backdoor is open, the attacker can use one or more tools to open up further
holes or cause damage. This type of backdoor attack has been previously documented by Trend Micro in a
blog post in May.
Beginnings of an attack
The attack begins when the Windows OS starts the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC)
service, which coordinates transactions that span multiple resource managers, such as databases, message
queues, and ﬁle systems. When the target computer joins a domain, once the MSDTC service starts, it will
search the registry.

Figure 1. MSDTC service DLL plugins
Speciﬁcally, the MTxOCI component in MSDTC service searches for three DLLs: oci.dll, SQLLib80.dll, and
xa80.dll. oci.dll isn’t normally found on the computer, but in this case, the hacker has created a backdoor
component , renamed it to oci.dll, and placed it in %SystemRoot%\system32\. Once the oci.dll is in place, the
hacker uses a remote job command to kill the MSDTC service (taskkill /im msdtc.exe /f), causing MSDTC to
reload itself. This time, however, it looks for and ﬁnds the oci.dll. Calling this DLL opens up Shadow Force.

This simple technique bypasses forensics tools such as autorun.exe, and makes live detection and remediation
more difﬁcult.
Analysis of Shadow Force
Shadow Force has several different variations, both in DLL and EXE formats and in a 32-bit or 64-bit
implementations. The type of variation will rely on installe.exe, the ﬁle that downloads and installs Shadow
Force on the computer. If install.exe runs in 32-bit mode, it will download SuperBot.exe. If it runs in 64-bit
mode, it will download SuperBotx64.exe.

Take SuperBot.exe as an example. It is a Shadow Force .exe version, and it will connect to a C&C server
(irc[.]itembuy[.]org) like a normal IRC bot.

The DLL version of Shadow Force uses another type of attack. Rather than connect to a C&C server, it uses a
port-reuse technique by downloading and installing the ﬁle npf.sys. The npf.sys ﬁle (downloaded by Shadow
Force as a part of its function) comes from famous open source project Wireshark, a well-known network
protocol analyzer. Therefore, the npf.sys has a valid signature and can be loaded in Windows, to be used in
capturing network packets. Connecting to Shadow Force requires a speciﬁc password in the correct format.

as legitimate users would
Once an attacker has gained access to a client system on an otherwise protected network, there are a number
of tools that are available to exploit systems, networks, and beyond. These include ﬁleh.exe, latinfect.exe,
and aio.exe. More information about these tools, along with information about the presumed attacker can be
found in the technical brief.
Trend Micro Custom Defense solutions can protect organizations from this type of backdoor attack. These
solutions provide in-depth contextual analysis and insight that help IT administrators properly identify
suspicious behavior on individual computers and on the network, such as the access to computers and servers.
