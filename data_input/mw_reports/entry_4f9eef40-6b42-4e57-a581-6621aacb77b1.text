DPRK Hidden Cobra Update: North Korean Malicious
Cyber Activity

North Korea (specifically the Lazarus group) has a long and storied history of destructive
cyber-attacks. Some more notable examples are the 2013 “Dark Seoul” attacks, the 2014
attack on Sony Pictures, a series of SWIFT-targeted campaigns in 2015-2016, and more
recently their foray into commercial cybercrime operations with Trickbot and Anchor.
The US-CERT recently released a new set of MARs (Malware Analysis Reports) covering
newly uncovered/updated malware/implants attributed to North Korea. More specifically,
these are tools attributed to the Lazarus Group / Hidden Cobra. These updates provide a
sizeable glimpse into the ever expanding DPRK toolset. As we have seen in the past, the
complexity and sophistication of these tools varies widely. Most of the families covered in this
update are meant to function as RATs or Cobalt-Strike-like (beacon) tools meant to enable
persistence and manipulation of infected hosts.

BISTROMATH
Full Featured RAT (Remote Access Trojan) payloads and associated CAgent11 implant
builder/controller. This implant is used for standard system management, control and recon.
Initial infection is carried out via a malicious executable. An embedded bitmap image
(contained in the trojan) is decoded into shellcode upon execution, thus loading the implant.

1/7

Network communications are encrypted via XOR. The analyzed BISTROMATH samples,
along with the other families all attempt to evade analysis via common sandboxes
(VIRTUALBOX, QEMU, VMware) via multiple artifact checks (presence of specific devices,
registry entries, processes, files).
Core functionality includes:
· File and Process manipulation
· File/Data upload/exfiltration
· Timestamp modification/masquerading
· Service start/stop
· CMD shell access / use
· Screenshot Capture
· Microphone Capture
· Webcam Control
· Keylogging
· Browser hijacking/form grabbing
· Exfiltration of cached credentials
· Self-management (update/uninstall)

HOPLIGHT
Proxy payload to obfuscate and/or re-route traffic between infected hosts and C2. Traffic is
encrypted over SSL, and the individual payloads are capable of generating fake SSL
Certificates. Analyzed samples are Themida packed. One of the examples (SHA256:
d77fdabe17cdba62a8e728cbe6c740e2c2e541072501f77988674e07a05dfb39) provided by
CISA contained a public SSL certificate and encrypted payload.

SLICKSHOES
SLICKSHOES is typically utilized as a loader/Dropper. The malware writes itself to
“C:WindowsWebtaskenc.exe”. Separate processes are responsible for the manipulation and
execution of the dropped executable. SLICKSHOES is a full beacon-style implant (similar to
Cobalt Strike).
Makes use of bespoke encoding methods and is capable of RAT-like functionality.
· File and Process manipulation
· System recon and exfiltration
· Input capture
· Command/process execution and manipulation
SLICKSHOES communicates to a hardcoded C2 address (188[.]165[.]37[.]168) on TCP port
80. Communication occurs in 60-second intervals.
2/7

CROWDEDFLOUNDER
CROWDEDFLOUNDER functions as a memory-resident RAT (32-bit and Themida packed).
The malware accepts arguments at runtime, and can be installed as a service.
CROWDEDFLOUNDER implants can perform full two-way comms with C2, however in
context the primary function appears to be a proxy for inbound connections from the C2.
Upon execution the malware will manipulate local firewall settings to allow for flow of its
traffic. C2 traffic and data transfers are encrypted via rotating XOR.
Functionality includes:
· File and Process manipulation
· System recon and exfiltration
· Input capture
· Command/process execution and manipulation

HOTCROISSANT
HOTCROISSANT is a full beacon-style (Cobalt Strike style) implant with RAT-like
functionality. Network traffic is encoded via XOR. C2 communications are limited to a hardcoded IP (94.177.123.138:8088). Upon infection, victim information is transferred to the C2.
After this point, the malware listens and responds to commands from the C2.

ARTFULPIE
ARTFULPIE is responsible for retrieval and injection of a DLL-based payload. The malware
contains a hard-coded URL from which to download the additional code
(193[.]56[.]28[.]103).

BUFFETLINE
BUFFETLINE is a full, beacon-style, implant with RAT-like functionality.
Features include:
· File and Process manipulation
· System recon and exfiltration
· CLI status manipulation
· Lateral targeting & enumeration
· Command/process execution and manipulation
Analyzed samples utilize a combination of RC4 encoding and PolarSSL (auth) to obfuscate
network communications. Once authenticated to the C2, the trojan will send a collection of
victim information and then await further interaction.
3/7

Data transferred includes:
· Victim “ID”
· Implant Version
· System directory location
· Hardware details (network adapters, CPU revision)
· OS Version / Software environment data
· Computer Name
· Victim IP Address

Conclusion
Adversarial toolsets are constantly evolving. The upper tier of sophisticated, or state-backed
threats, have rapid and agile development/release cycles, mirroring the world of legitimate
software development. Staying on top of these trends is a critical piece of protecting our
environments against these threats. A power and modern security platform (ex: SentinelOne
Singularity) is required to tackle these evolving threats from both static and behavioral
angles.
