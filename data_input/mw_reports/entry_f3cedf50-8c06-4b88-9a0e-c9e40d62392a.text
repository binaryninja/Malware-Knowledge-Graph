In the wake of the 2016 United States Presidential Election, not even six hours after
Donald Trump became the nation’s President-Elect, an advanced persistent threat (APT)
group launched a series of coordinated and well-planned spear phishing campaigns.
Volexity observed ﬁve diﬀerent attack waves with a heavy focus on U.S.-based think
tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These e-mails came from a mix of
attacker created Google Gmail accounts and what appears to be compromised e-mail
accounts at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). These e-mails were sent in
large quantities to diﬀerent individuals across many organizations and individuals focusing
in national security, defense, international aﬀairs, public policy, and European and
Asian studies. Two of the attacks purported to be messages forwarded on from the
Clinton Foundation giving insight and perhaps a postmortem analysis into the elections.
Two of the other attacks purported to be eFax links or documents pertaining to the
election’s outcome being revised or rigged. The last attack claimed to be a link to a PDF
download on “Why American Elections Are Flawed.” Volexity believes a group it refers to
as The Dukes (also known as APT29 or Cozy Bear) is responsible for post-election attack
activity.

Background
Since August of this year, Volexity has been actively involved in investigating and tracking
several attack campaigns from the Dukes. Most notably the Dukes have previously been
tied to the breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and intrusions into
multiple high-proﬁle United States Government organizations. In July 2015, the Dukes
started heavily targeting think tanks and NGOs. This represented a fairly signiﬁcant shift
in the group’s previous operations and one that continued in the lead up to and
immediately after the 2016 United States Presidential election.
On August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016, the Dukes launched several waves of highly
targeted spear phishing attacks against several U.S.-based think tanks and NGOs. These
spear phishing messages were spoofed and made to appear to have been sent from real
individuals at well-known think tanks in the United States and Europe. These August
waves of attacks purported to be from individuals at Transparency International, the
1/17

Center for a New American Security (CNAS), the International Institute for Strategic
Studies (IISS), Eurasia Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
The Dukes are known for launching their attacks by sending links to ZIP ﬁles, that contain
malicious executables, hosted on legitimate compromised web servers. However, each of
the e-mail messages from the August attacks contained a Microsoft Oﬃce Word (.doc) or
Excel (.xls) attachment. These attachments, when viewed, contained legitimate report
content from each of the organizations they appeared to have been sent from. However,
the attackers inserted macros into the documents designed to install a malware
downloader on the system. Successful exploitation would result in the download of a PNG
image ﬁle from a compromised webserver. These attack campaigns leveraged
steganography in the PNG ﬁles by hiding components of a backdoor that would exist only
in memory after being loaded into rundll32.exe. Volexity has dubbed this backdoor
PowerDuke. Similar attack campaigns using documents with macros dropping
PowerDuke were further observed through October, where Universities, and not think
tanks appear to have been the primary targets. Details of these attacks have been
provided to Volexity customers. Concerned NGO’s and Universities that may have been
targeted by these attacks campaigns are welcome to reach out for additional details.

November 9 – Post-Election Spear Phishing Waves
The post-election attacks launched by the Dukes on November 9 were very similar to
previous attacks seen from the Dukes in both 2015 and 2016. The PowerDuke malware,
ﬁrst seen in August 2016, was once again used in these most recent attacks. Three of the
ﬁve attack waves contained links to download ﬁles from domains that the attackers
appear to have control over. The other two attacks contained documents with malicious
macros embedded within them. Each of these diﬀerent attack waves were slightly
diﬀerent from one another and are detailed below.

Attack Wave 1: eFax – The “Shocking” Truth About Election Rigging
The ﬁrst attack wave is similar to much older attacks from the Dukes that purport to be an
electronic Fax. This message claims to have been sent from Secure Fax Corp. and has a
link to a ZIP ﬁle that contains a Microsoft shortcut ﬁle (.LNK). This shortcut ﬁle contains
PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean
decoy document. The e-mail message was sent from the attacker controlled e-mail
account industry.faxsolution@gmail.com. The screen shot below shows the e-mail that
was sent.

Attack Wave 2: eFax – Elections Outcome Could Be revised [Facts of
Elections Fraud]
The second attack wave that Volexity observed leveraged a Microsoft Word document
with a malicious embedded macro. This appears to be consistent with several previous
Dukes attack campaigns, such as those on August 25, 2016. The Macros contain several
anti-VM checks designed to avoid executing in virtualized environments. The e-mail
message was sent from the attacker controlled e-mail account
securefaxsolution@gmail.com.

Attack Wave 3: Why American Elections Are Flawed
Volexity believes the following e-mail received the widest distribution among the targeted
organizations. The e-mail purports to have been sent from Harvard’s “PDF Mobile
Service” or “PFD Mobile Service”. The spelling of this non-existent service is inconsistent
in the e-mail. The latter spelling appears to be a typographical error that is consistent with
the domain names registered by the attackers. The screen shot below shows the e-mail
that was sent.

Attack Wave 4: Clinton Foundation FYI #1
The fourth attack wave that Volexity observed leveraged a Microsoft Word document with
a malicious embedded macro. This appears to be consistent with several previous Dukes
attack campaigns, such as those on August 25, 2016. The Macros contain several antiVM checks designed to avoid executing in virtualized environments. The screen shot
below shows the e-mail that was sent.

Attack Wave 5: Clinton Foundation FYI #2
The ﬁfth attack wave that Volexity observed once against leveraged a download link and a
new domain that appears to be under control of the attackers. The link in the e-mail points
to a ZIP ﬁle that has a Microsoft shortcut ﬁle (.LNK) inside of it. This shortcut ﬁle contains
PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean
decoy document. Like Attack Wave #3, this e-mail message also purported to be
forwarded from Laura Graham at the Clinton Foundation. The message body contained
dozens of e-mail addresses to which the message originally claims to have been sent,
with organizations similar to Attack Wave #3. The e-mail message from this attack wave,
with identifying information removed, is shown below.

The PowerDuke Backdoor
The PowerDuke backdoor boasts a pretty extensive list of features that allow the Dukes to
examine and control a system. Volexity suspects the feature set that has been built into
PowerDuke is an extension of their anti-VM capabilities in the initial dropper ﬁles. Several
commands supported by PowerDuke facilitate getting information about the system.
A previous analysis of PowerDuke showed it supported the following commands.
comp

get the NetBIOS name via GetComputerNameEx

domain

get the computer’s domain via NetWkstaGetInfo
13/17

drives

get logical drives, drive type, free space, serial number, etc.

fsize

get the size of a ﬁle via GetFileAttributesExW or failing that, by mapping the
ﬁle and getting the size

kill

stop a process via TerminateProcess

memstat

get memory usage status via GlobalMemoryStatusEx, total RAM, percent
used, etc.

osdate

get the time the machine was built (via InstallDate registry key)

osver

get OS info via registry, such as ProductName, CurrentBuild,
CurrentVersion, CSDBuildNumber, etc.

pslist

list processes via CreateToolhelp32Snapshot

pwd

get current directory via GetCurrentDirectoryW

run

start a process via CreateProcessW

#

runs cmd.exe /c and gets the output via Named Pipe and sends the data
back

siduser

gets the current user’s SID via GetTokenInformation and
LookupAccountSidW

time

the time + timezone (GetLocalTime and GetTimeZoneInformation)

uptime

number of seconds since the last boot

user

the user’s name via GetUserNameExW

wipe

writes random data across a ﬁle, then deletes the ﬁle

wnd

gets the text of the current foreground window

fgetp

download ﬁle

14/17

fputp

upload ﬁle

power

reboot or shutdown (via previously loaded PowrProf.dll)

cdt

change to temporary directory

reqdelay

sleep for speciﬁed time

Volexity has not fully examined the PowerDuke instances from these campaigns but has
noted the malware appears to support the following additional commands not described
above:
sidcomp
buzy
exit
copy
detectav
mkdir
software
shlist
shinfo
shdel
shadd
setpng
conn
setsrv
Volexity may update this post following further PowerDuke analysis.

Conclusion
The Dukes continue to launch well-crafted and clever attack campaigns. They have had
tremendous success evading anti-virus and anti-malware solutions at both the desktop
and mail gateway levels. The group’s anti-VM macros and PowerShell scripts appear to
16/17

have drastically reduced the number of sandboxes and bots that the group has to deal
with on their command and control infrastructure. This combined with their use of
steganography to hide their backdoor within PNG ﬁles that are downloaded remotely and
loaded in memory only or via alternate data streams (ADS) is quite novel in its approach.
Volexity believes that the Dukes are likely working to gain long-term access into think
tanks and NGOs and will continue to launch new attacks for the foreseeable future.
