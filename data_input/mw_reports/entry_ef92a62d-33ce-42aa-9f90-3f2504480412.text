Report: No ‘Eternal Blue’ Exploit Found in Baltimore City
Ransomware

For almost the past month, key computer systems serving the government of Baltimore, Md.
have been held hostage by a ransomware strain known as “Robbinhood.” Media
publications have cited sources saying the Robbinhood version that hit Baltimore city
computers was powered by “Eternal Blue,” a hacking tool developed by the U.S. National
Security Agency (NSA) and leaked online in 2017. But new analysis suggests that while
Eternal Blue could have been used to spread the infection, the Robbinhood malware itself
contains no traces of it.
On May 25, The New York Times cited unnamed security experts briefed on the attack who
blamed the ransomware’s spread on the Eternal Blue exploit, which was linked to the global
WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017.
That story prompted a denial from the NSA that Eternal Blue was somehow used in the
Baltimore attack. It also moved Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott to write the
Maryland governor asking for federal disaster assistance and reimbursement as a result.
But according to Joe Stewart, a seasoned malware analyst now consulting with security firm
Armor, the malicious software used in the Baltimore attack does not contain any Eternal Blue
exploit code. Stewart said he obtained a sample of the malware that he was able to confirm
was connected to the Baltimore incident.
“We took a look at it and found a pretty vanilla ransomware binary,” Stewart said. “It doesn’t
even have any means of spreading across networks on its own.”
Stewart said while it’s still possible that the Eternal Blue exploit was somehow used to
propagate the Robbinhood ransomware, it’s not terribly likely. Stewart said in a typical breach
that leads to a ransomware outbreak, the intruders will attempt to leverage a single infection
and use it as a jumping-off point to compromise critical systems on the breached network
that would allow the malware to be installed on a large number of systems simultaneously.
“It certainly wouldn’t be the go-to exploit if your objective was to identify critical systems and
then only when you’re ready launch the attack so you can do it all at once,” Stewart said. “At
this point, Eternal Blue is probably going to be detected by internal [security] systems, or the
target might already be patched for it.”
It is not known who is behind the Baltimore ransomware attack, but Armor said it was
confident that the bad actor(s) in this case were the same individual(s) using the nowsuspended twitter account @Robihkjn (Robbinhood). Until it was suspended at around 3:00

p.m. ET today (June 3), the @Robihkjn account had been taunting the mayor of Baltimore
and city council members, who have refused to pay the ransom demand of 13 bitcoin —
approximately $100,000.
In several of those tweets, the Twitter account could be seen posting links to documents
allegedly stolen from Baltimore city government systems, ostensibly to both prove that those
behind the Twitter account were responsible for the attack, and possibly to suggest what may
happen to more of those documents if the city refuses to pay up by the payment deadline set
by the extortionists — currently June 7, 2019 (the attackers postponed that deadline once
already).

Some of @robihkjn’s tweets taunting Baltimore city leaders over non-payment of the $100,000
ransomware demand. The tweets included links to images of documents allegedly stolen by the
intruders.

Over the past few days, however, the tweets from @Robinhkjn have grown more frequent
and profanity-laced, directed at Baltimore’s leaders. The account also began tagging dozens
of reporters and news organizations on Twitter.

Stewart said the @Robinhkjn Twitter account may be part of an ongoing campaign by the
attackers to promote their own Robbinhood ransomware-as-a-service offering. According to
Armor’s analysis, Robbinhood comes with multiple HTML templates that can be used to
substitute different variables of the ransom demand, such as the ransom amount and the
.onion address that victims can use to negotiate with the extortionists or pay a ransom
demand.
“We’ve come to the conclusion Robbinhood was set up to be a multi-tenant ransomware-asa-service offering,” Stewart said. “And we’re wondering if maybe this is all an effort to raise
the name recognition of the malware so the authors can then go on the Dark Web and
advertise it.”

This redacted message is present on the Dark Web panel set up by the extortionists to accept
payment for the Baltimore ransomware incident and to field inquiries or pleas from them. The
message repeats the last tweet from the @robihkjn Twitter account and conclusively ties that account
to the attackers. Image: Armor.

There was one other potential — albeit likely intentional — clue that Stewart said he found in
his analysis of the malware: Its code included the text string “Valery.” While this detail by
itself is not particularly interesting, Stewart said an earlier version of the GandCrab
ransomware strain would place a photo of a Russian man named Valery Sinyaev in every
existing folder where it would encrypt files. PCRisk.com, the company that blogged about
this connection to the GandCrab variant, asserts Mr. Sinyaev is a respectable finance
professional who has nothing to do with GandCrab.
The timing of the GandCrab connection is notable because just last week, the creators of
GandCrab announced they were shutting down their ransomware-as-a-service product,
allegedly after earning more than $2 billion in ransom payments.

Finally, since we’re on the subject of major ransomware attacks and scary exploits, it’s a
good time to remind readers about the importance of applying the latest security updates
from Microsoft, which last month took the unusual step of releasing security updates for
unsupported but still widely-used Windows operating systems like XP and Windows
2003. Microsoft did this to head off another WannaCry-like outbreak from mass-exploitation
of a newly discovered flaw that Redmond called imminently “wormable.”
That vulnerability exists in Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008
R2, and Windows Server 2008. In a reminder about the urgency of patching this bug,
Microsoft on May 30 published a post saying while it hasn’t seen any widespread exploitation
of the flaw yet, it took about two months after Microsoft released a fix for the Eternal Blue
exploit in March 2017 for WannaCry to surface.
“Almost two months passed between the release of fixes for the EternalBlue vulnerability and
when ransomware attacks began,” Microsoft warned. “Despite having nearly 60 days to
patch their systems, many customers had not. A significant number of these customers were
infected by the ransomware.”
