Telsy analyzed a new campaign that targeted Afghanistan and aimed to steal documents.

Introduction
Telsy last June analyzed a new campaign that targeted Afghanistan, specifically researchers
and government employees.
The attack aimed to steal documents from the attacked systems and put them in an external
Google Drive.
Most likely, the attack was conducted via spear-phishing and also used a decoy document to
hide the real actions.
The peculiarity of the attack is that the payload, which opens the decoy document and
released the malware into the system, was hosted on an Indian website
“hxxps://dadsasoa.in“, which is linked to the Defense Accounts Department (DAD) of India.
The Defense Accounts Department (DAD) operates under the administrative control of
India’s Ministry of Defense and is headed by the Controller General of Defense Accounts.
The website has been, several times, used as an infection vector due to compromise, i.e.
allowing the download of malicious payloads.

Analysis
The attack starts with an lnk file, most likely, sent as an attachment through the mail.
The shortcut downloads from a website “hxxps://dadsasoa.in” an hta file and then execute it.
The hta is a javascript file that open a decoy document and drops the real payload to
exfiltrate documents.
The final payload, i.e. winstr.exe, is used just to exfiltrate documents of the system
uploading them to a private Google Drive.
Once executed, the malware will check for the following file types in certain locations to
upload them into Google Drive: pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx and txt.
This malware is written in GOLang and uses the common libraries to interact with Google
Drive API.
In order to use the Google Drive API, it’s required to create a Google application and then
the account that wants to use the API should ‘agree’ and install the application.
In order to upload the files to Google Drive, the client_id and client_secret were embedded
on the malware, together with a refresh token.
Refresh tokens are needed as part of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which is used by Google Drive.
This protocol is used by Twitter, Facebook and other sites to use their accounts to log in to a
different website. Access tokens are used to have access on a Google Drive account.
However, access tokens expire so refresh tokens are needed to get new access tokens.
Once the access token expires, the application uses the refresh token, that never expires, to
obtain a new one.
If you try to install the google application, it is highlighted that the app is not signed and the
developer’s email revealed: gillufarooq[@]gmail.com.
Then, the research has been driven to the Google Drive, trying to figure out wich entity was
compromised.
Indeed using the information hardcoded in the sample, we were able to list the files on the
Google Drive and get some information on the owner of the drive self.
The Google Drive owner is: daafghanistanbankbank[@]gmail.com.
Since the gmail space used is 0 bytes and photos space too, it is most likely that this account
is not a compromised one but just an account created by the attacker.

Another evidence of this, is that this email seems to be not available on official channels of
the Afghanistan.
First thing done was to list the directories and through the Ips trying to discern the virtual
machine and real attacked systems.
Some of these are virtual machine used to analyze malwares, some other are real victims of
the campaign like Dell-PC\\Dell IP =180.94.xx.xx
This IP uploaded something like 5000 documents, most of them are government
communications and letters between governement employees.
The system infected seems to belong to an office manager of Ministry of Borders and Tribal
Affairs of the Afghanistan.
This type of spear-phishing campaign, using Google Drive as an exfiltration channel,
manages to evade the main detection systems as it generates traffic that is not categorized
as malicious.
