Ransomware developers continue to release infections that are clearly not tested well and
contain bugs that may make it difficult, if not impossible, for victims to recover their files.
Such is the case with the new in the wild ransomware called Thanatos that has been
discovered by security researcher MalwareHunterTeam.
When the Thanatos Ransomware infects a victim it will use a new key for each encrypted file.
The problem, according to researcher Francesco Muroni, is that these keys are never saved
anywhere. This means that if a user pays the ransom, the ransomware developer does not
have a method that will actually be able to decrypt each file. Therefore, it is not
recommended that victims pay the Thanatos ransom for any reason.
The good news is that according to Muroni it may be possible to brute force the encryption
key for each file. This would take quite a bit of time and would require the file to be a
common file type with a known magic header.

Thanatos is the first ransomware to accept Bitcoin Cash
While the encryption part of Thanatos is a mess, the ransomware does introduce something
new. That is being the first ransomware to accept Bitcoin Cash as a ransom payment.
For those unfamiliar with Bitcoin Cash, it is a new cryptocurrency that was spun off from
Bitcoin. When Bitcoin hit block 478,558, Bitcoin was forked into a new cryptocurrency called
Bitcoin Cash. When this fork occurred, Bitcoin holders were then given an equivalent amount
of Bitcoin Cash. For example, if a user had 2 Bitcoins at the time of the fork, they would have
received 2 Bitcoin Cash as well.
While Thanatos accepts both Bitcoin and Etherum as a ransom payment, this is the first time
that Bitcoin Cash has been accepted as shown in the ransom note below.

How Thanatos Ransomware encrypts a Computer
When the Thanatos Ransomware encrypts a computer it will generate a new encryption key
for every file encrypted. As discussed already, unfortunately these encryption keys are not
saved anywhere and thus according to researchers it would not be possible for the developers
to decrypt the files even if a ransom payment is made.
When encrypting files it will append the .THANATOS extension to an encrypted file's name.
For example, a file named test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed as test.jpg.THANATOS.

Thanatos Encrypted Files

After the encryption process is finished it will then connect to iplogger.com/1t3i37 URL in
order to keep track of the amount of victims that have been infected.
Finally, it will generate an autorun key called "Microsoft Update System Web-Helper" that
opens the README.txt ransom note every time a user logs in. This ransom note can be seen
in the article's previous section.
This ransom note contains instructions to send a $200 USD ransom payment to one of the
listed Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash addresses. The user is then instructed to
contact thanatos1.1@yandex.com with their unique victim ID in order to receive a decryption
program.
As already stated, this ransomware can not be decrypted normally due to it not saving the
encryption keys and thus the ransom payment should not be made. If anyone is infected with
this ransomware, they should contact us about the possible creation of a brute force program.

How to protect yourself from the Thanatos Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from ransomware in general, it is important that you use good
computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a
reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such
as a ransomware attack.

You should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat
ransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft AntiMalware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent
many, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases
are the most important steps of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure
you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs
contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.
Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral
detections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your
willing to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.
