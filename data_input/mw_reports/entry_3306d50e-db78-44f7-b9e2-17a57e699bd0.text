Introduction
Three major campaigns using malicious spam (malspam) to distribute malware stopped
sending malspam before Christmas-sometime during the week ending on Sunday 2018-1223. These three campaigns are Emotet (also known as Feodo), Hancitor (also known as
Chanitor or Tordal), and Trickbot. But this week, all three campaigns have been sending out
malspam again.
Among these campaigns, Emotet is by far the most active. Dozens of indicators are
discovered every day as vectors for Emotet infections. Emotet also acts a distributor for
other families of malware. So far in 2019, I’ve seen Emotet retrieve Gootkit and the IcedID
banking Trojan. As 2019 progresses, I expect to find examples of Emotet distributing other
families of malware like Qakbot and Trickbot, something we saw in 2018.
Today’s diary examines recent Emotet malspam and two examples of infection traffic from
Tuesday 2019-01-15.

Shown above: Chain of events for Emotet malware distribution seen so far this year.
The malspam
As usual, emails pushing Emotet use Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros. On
vulnerable Windows hosts, opening these documents in Microsoft Word and enabling
macros will attempt an Emotet infection. So far this week, Emotet malspam had a link to
download the Word document, or it’s had a Word document directly attached to the email.
See the images below for examples.

The traffic
Network traffic is typical for what we’ve seen with recent Emotet infections from December
2018. Emotet frequently uses HTTP traffic over non-standard TCP ports (not TCP port 80).
This may cause issues when reviewing the infection traffic in Wireshark. Traffic on ports like
TCP port 53 (associated with DNS activity like zone transfers) and TCP port 22 (normally
associated with SSH) may not be decoded as HTTP in Wireshark. That was the case with
two examples of infection traffic I generated on Monday.
Post-infection activity from the first run included Gootkit, which had similar in traffic patterns
that I’ve previously documented. Post-infection activity from the second run included IcedID
(also known as Bokbot), something I’ve also documented.

The following are indicators from two infections on Tuesday 2019-01-15. Any malicious
URLs, IP addresses, and domain names have been “de-fanged” to avoid issues when
viewing today’s diary.
