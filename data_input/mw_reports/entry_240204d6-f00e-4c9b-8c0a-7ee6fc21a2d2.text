How public water suppliers can guard against cyber-attacks on water supplies.

Notice to Public Water Suppliers
Dear Public Water Suppliers,
Due to recent reports of cyber-attacks on the water sector, all utilities are advised to be on
heightened alert and encouraged to actively monitor their computer systems for any unusual
activity. The most recent attack that you may have heard about occurred in Oldsmar, Florida,
and involved targeting the chemical feed system. Specifically, the malevolent actor attempted
to increase sodium hydroxide dosages to very high levels. This was quickly identified as an
unauthorized intrusion by the system’s plant operator who took quick action to stop the threat
before any public health and safety was compromised.
You can access the news reports and press conference through the links below to learn
more about this specific event, which is currently an active investigation coordinated by the
FBI with state and local authorities.

Additional information about cybersecurity breach in Florida
Dear Public Water Supplier,
We appreciate your attention to cybersecurity and the recent incident in Florida. Here is a
more specific description on the events and suggested protective measures.
The FBI, DHS, US Secret Service, and the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office have issued a
joint situational report that concerns the water sector. EPA is providing critical information
from this report to the WSCC and GCC for awareness. EPA recommends that all water
systems implement the mitigation measures listed at the end of this report where applicable.
Background
On 5 February 2021, unidentified cyber actors obtained unauthorized access, on two
separate occasions, approximately five hours apart, to the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system used at a local municipality’s water treatment plant. The
unidentified actors accessed the SCADA system’s software and altered the amount of
sodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical, used as part of the water treatment process. Water
treatment plant personnel immediately noticed the change in dosing amounts and corrected
the issue before the SCADA system’s software detected the manipulation and alarmed due
to the unauthorized change. As a result, the water treatment process remained unaffected
and continued to operate as normal.
The unidentified actors accessed the water treatment plant’s SCADA controls via remote
access software, TeamViewer, which was installed on one of several computers the water
treatment plant personnel used to conduct system status checks and to respond to alarms or
any other issues that arose during the water treatment process. All computers used by water
plant personnel were connected to the SCADA system and used the 32-bit version of the
Windows 7 operating system. Further, all computers shared the same password for remote
access and appeared to be connected directly to the Internet without any type of firewall
protection installed.
Recommended Mitigation
Restrict all remote connections to SCADA systems, specifically those that allow
physical control and manipulation of devices within the SCADA network. One-way
unidirectional monitoring devices are recommended to monitor SCADA systems
remotely.
Install a firewall software/hardware appliance with logging and ensure it is turned on.
The firewall should be secluded and not permitted to communicate with unauthorized
sources.
3/5

Keep computers, devices, and applications, including SCADA/industrial control
systems (ICS) software, patched and up-to-date.
Use two-factor authentication with strong passwords.
Only use secure networks and consider installing a virtual private network (VPN).
Implement an update- and patch-management cycle. Patch all systems for critical
vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching of Internet-connected systems for known
vulnerabilities and software processing Internet data, such as Web browsers, browser
plugins, and document readers.
