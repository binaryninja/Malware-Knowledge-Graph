The notorious TrickBot malware mistakenly left a test module that is warning victims that they
are infected and should contact their administrator.
TrickBot is a malware infection that is commonly distributed via malicious spam emails.
When installed, the malware will run quietly on a victim's machine while it downloads various
modules that perform different tasks on the infected computer.
These modules allow the malware to steal a domain's Active Directory Services database,
harvest browser passwords and cookies, steal OpenSSH keys, and spread laterally
throughout a network.
To make matters worse, TrickBot is known to finalize their attacks by giving access to
ransomware operators such as Ryuk and Conti.

TrickBot devs made a mistake
In a recent release of the TrickBot malware analyzed by Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, the
threat actors are mistakenly distributing a test version of their password-stealing grabber.dll
module.

When loaded, this module displays a warning in the default browser stating that the program
is gathering information and that the victim should ask their system administrator.

The warning shown by TrickBot's grabber module
Warning
You see this message because the program named grabber gathered some information from
your browser.
If you do not know what is happening it is the time to start be worrying.
Please, ask your system administrator for details.

This warning is not an isolated case either as BleepingComputer found a user infected with
TrickBot who posted about this warning 16 days ago on Reddit.
"Firefox is warning me about a "program named grabber." What is it and what should I do?,"
the Reddit user asked.
Grabber.dll is TrickBot's password and cookie-stealing module that attempts to harvest
saved browser credentials and cookies from Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Firefox.
These stolen credentials and cookies can then be used to login to the victim's accounts.
Kremez was able to extract the documentation embedded in the module, which we shared
below.

For a detailed technical analysis of this grabber.dll module, Kremez published a blog post on
the Advanced Intel site.
Kremez told BleepingComputer that the test module appears to be developed by the TrickBot
devs as it is "coded in the same fashion" as other modules. He believes that the threat
actors were testing a new version and forgot to remove it when it went live.
For those seeing this warning, Kremez advises that victims immediately disconnect their
computer from the network and then perform a scan with their installed security software.
Once your computer has been cleaned, victims should change their passwords at any site,
external or internal, whose credentials are saved in the browser or recently logged into from
the browser.
If a victim is on a corporate network, other computers may have also been compromised,
and a thorough investigation should be undertaken.
