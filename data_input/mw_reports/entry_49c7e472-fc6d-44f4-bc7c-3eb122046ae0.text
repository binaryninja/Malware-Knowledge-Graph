Kaseya, makers of popular IT software used by managed service providers (MSPs),
was recently affected by a REvil ransomware attack

The recent REvil ransomware incident involving the compromise of a remote management
software vendor, Kaseya, did not endanger CrowdStrike customers because the CrowdStrike
Falcon platform would have functioned to block the REvil ransomware attack on their
systems. Using the power of machine learning and behavior-based detection, the Falcon
platform is able to identify and block REvil ransomware in the early stages of the attack. For
the best protection, Falcon customers should enable “Suspicious Processes” detection,
which is among the policies CrowdStrike recommends for the Falcon platform.

CrowdStrike Intelligence has been tracking the evolution of REvil ransomware and the
PINCHY SPIDER threat actor group developing it since 2018. The group is believed to have
also been involved in the development of the now defunct GandCrab ransomware.
Similarities between REvil (also known as “Sodinokibi”) and GandCrab led CrowdStrike
Intelligence to suspect these two ransomware are related.

What Happened?
On Friday, July 2, REvil ransomware operators managed to compromise Kaseya VSA
software, used to monitor and manage Kaseya customer’s infrastructure. REvil ransomware
operators used zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver a malicious update, compromising fewer
than 60 Kaseya customers and 1,500 downstream companies, according to Kaseya’s public
statement.
These vulnerabilities were previously identified and privately reported to Kaseya by the
Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure. Current reports suggest that the REvil operator
made use of a privately disclosed vulnerability, now tracked as CVE-2021-30116, in order to
achieve execution.
Kaseya has recommended that on-premises partners keep their VSA servers offline, as they
are currently in the process of releasing a patch to address the issues. Meanwhile, recent
reports suggest REvil operators initially asked for a ransom of $70 million USD, claiming to
have infected more than 1 million systems. A surprising development is that REvil operators
may have lowered the ransom demand to $50 million USD along with an offer of a universal
decryptor for all victims.

How CrowdStrike Falcon Protects Customers From REvil
Ransomware
The Falcon platform was designed from the ground up to leverage the power of the cloud,
machine learning and behavioral detection to protect organizations from sophisticated
attacks and threats, such as ransomware.
The Falcon platform takes a layered approach to prevent, identify and protect customers
from ransomware, including REvil ransomware. In this particular case, the Falcon sensor can
prevent the attack whenever a suspicious process usually associated with ransomware is
triggered, as well as detect the REvil ransomware using on-sensor and in-the-cloud machine
learning as well as behavioral detection with indicators of attack (IOAs). It can also detect if a
legitimate process, such as the one associated with the Kaseya VSA, is attempting to load
malicious code. In addition, the Falcon OverWatch™ team is constantly monitoring and will
immediately notify customers if they observe behaviors associated with nation-state or
eCrime threat actors like PINCHY SPIDER, enabling the customer to take action against the
threat.

Falcon has the ability to protect clients from this campaign by identifying suspicious
processes associated with ransomware. The Falcon platform uses IOAs to detect and
prevent suspicious processes from being executed and protects customers from
ransomware campaigns early in the attack chain, before the payload is executed.

The unique leverage that machine learning brings to the security industry is that it can
identify both known and unknown malware, by understanding malicious intent based solely
on the attributes of a file without prior knowledge of it. Falcon machine learning can provide
coverage for REvil ransomware by accurately identifying and blocking the attack in multiple
places.
Falcon protects customers from ransomware including new or unknown REvil samples, as
well as accurately identifies and blocks malicious behavior indicative of ransomware.

Falcon utilizes a multi-layered approach to IOA coverage that targets multiple steps in an
attack chain. In this case, the Kaseya process spawns a cmd shell to perform subsequent
malicious actions such as disabling various scanning and other security solutions on the
endpoint. Falcon detects this behavior and terminates the cmd shell, thwarting the attack.
This prevents REvil being dropped to disk and sideloaded into MsMpeng.exe, an older but
legitimate version of a Windows Defender binary. Such coverage is the result of intelligence
derived from our continuous monitoring of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
associated with malware and threat actors’ behavior.
The Falcon platform also has the ability to identify the proxying execution of malicious
commands, even if the parent is a trusted process with signed binaries — effectively
detecting and preventing adversaries from abusing the VSA vulnerability and delivering the
malicious payload. This ability is demonstrated in the image below.

The Falcon platform protects customers from threats such as REvil ransomware as well as
sophisticated adversaries every day. It’s through our layered approach to security that we
secure the assets that matter most to our customers and remain focused on our mission to
stop breaches.

Recommendations
1. Use leading security technologies. Organizations need to use the right security
technologies to protect their infrastructure and most valuable assets from ransomware.
2. Use an endpoint security solution that takes a layered approach to preventing,
identifying and protecting customers from ransomware.
3. Do not give in to ransomware demands. The U.S government, law enforcement and
security companies recommend that organizations faced with ransomware demands
should not give in to extortion.
4. You are not alone — seek help and advice from experts. Companies experiencing
security incidents may have a difficult time or not have the resources for investigating
and recovering on their own.
If you suspect that your organization may have been impacted by REvil or any other threat,
we are here to help immediately with a Compromise Assessment to identify ongoing or past
attacker activity in your organization’s environment.
