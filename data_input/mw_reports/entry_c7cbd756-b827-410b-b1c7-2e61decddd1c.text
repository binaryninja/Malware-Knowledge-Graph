General guidance
1/2

Our general and primary guidance for companies and individuals alike continues to echo the
recommendations from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
"Shields Up" guidance.
Talos is proud of not only our team's cybersecurity response but also a volunteer OSINT
force of over 500 motivated Cisco teammates. Even more are undertaking humanitarian
refugee relief efforts to make life just a little safer and easier in a part of the world many have
never been. Teams have set aside their normal tasks, and now watch over Ukrainian
networks, others have focused on caring for and protecting refugees and still, others have
turned their obsession with social media into a critical component of our open-source
intelligence work.
