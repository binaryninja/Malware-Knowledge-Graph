Tesorion – Russia/ Ukraine Conflict Cyberaspect

Preface
Following the recent attacks affecting mainly Ukraine and the Baltic States, this
document provides an OSINT scan on the cyber aspects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
For example, last month large numbers of infections were observed, related to the
WhisperGate/Hermetic Wiper trojans, intended to make infected systems unusable, as
well as the Cyclops Blink malware. The most commonly mentioned threat actor behind
these malware attacks is the SandWorm APT group. This group was also responsible for
previous large-scale malware attacks on Ukraine, such as NotPetya, which also caused a
lot of damage in Western Europe.
With regard to the threat posed by the malware families and threat actors mentioned in
this report, Tesorion is assuming on the one hand that infections will spread
unintentionally to other countries, for example in Western Europe, and on the other
hand that parties in this region will also be active.
There is also a risk of further escalation in which the Netherlands and other EU countries,
possibly as a result of sanctions or other punitive measures, become the deliberate target
of threat actors behind these malware families. For example, when the EU decides to
exclude Russia and the SWIFT payment system.
The information in this report is derived from OSINT sources and public information
published during the past month. The technical indicators such as IP addresses, malware
hashes and Yara signatures can be used for the purpose of detecting and blocking
malicious traffic.
The remainder of this report thus provides more information on the following topics:
•
Malware Families & Threat Actors
•
Indicators of Compromise
