Research by: Feixiang He, Andrey Polkovnichenko
Check Point Research has recently discovered a group of Android applications massively
harvesting contact information on mobile phones without the user’s consent. The data
stealing logic hides inside a data analytics Software Development Kit (SDK) seen in up to
12 different mobile applications and has so far been downloaded over 111 million times.
Dubbed ‘Operation Sheep’, this massive data stealing campaign is the ﬁrst known
campaign seen in the wild to exploit the Man-in-the-Disk vulnerability revealed by Check
Point Research earlier last year.
The Attack Vector
The SDK, named SWAnalytics, is integrated into seemingly innocent Android applications
published on major 3rd party Chinese app stores such as Tencent MyApp, Wandoujia,
Huawei App Store, and Xiaomi App Store. After app installation, whenever SWAnalytics
senses victims opening up infected applications or rebooting their phones, it silently
uploads their entire contacts list to Hangzhou Shun Wang Technologies controlled servers.
From our ﬁrst malicious sample encounter back in mid-September until now, we have
observed 12 infected applications, the majority of which are in the system utility category.
In the Tencent MyApp store alone, 8 of 12 infected applications have a staggering total
number of over 111 million downloads. In theory, Shun Wang Technologies could have
collected a third of China’s population names and contact numbers if not more.

Operation Sheep: Pilfer-Analytics SDK in Action - Check Point Research

With no clear declaration of usage from Shun Wang, nor proper regulatory supervision,
such data could circulate into underground markets for further exploit, ranging from rogue
marketing, targeted telephone scams or even friend referral program abuse during
November’s Single’s Day and December’s Asian online shopping fest.
This paper will cover the discovery of this campaign, dubbed ‘Operation Sheep’, and an
analysis of SWAnalytics. We will also discuss the value of contact data from a cyber
criminal’s perspective, and assess the fallout effect of Operation Sheep on the global
mobile data security landscape.

Operation Sheep’s Attack Flow
Emergence of the Attack
In mid-September, an app named ‘Network Speed Master’ stood out on our radar with its
rather unusual behavior patterns. Upon initial analysis, we observed frequent access to
the user’s contacts data together with a sudden network transmission surge when the app
is opened or the mobile phone is rebooted. As a system utility application that simply tests
network connection speed, it reaches far beyond reasonable actions. Deeply intrigued, we
took a closer look.

Figure 1: ‘Network Speed Master’ on Tencent MyApp
We began with the app’s long Android permissions requirement, which usually signals
excessive data collection.

Figure 2: The Android permissions Network Speed Master asks for
Although it is worrying to see that most of the permissions were not related to the app’s
main features, it was still too early to conclude that Network Speed Master is a malware in
and of itself.
Although, many legitimate advertisement SDKs rely on bespoke permissions to proﬁle
users in order to study user preferences and promote personalized advertisement content,
we became much more skeptical when the “CoreReceiver” module appeared in the app’s
manifest. This module monitors a wide range of device activities including application
installation / remove / update, phone restart and battery charge.

Figure 3: CoreService and CoreReceiver event triggers
Following the user contacts data ﬂow, we quickly landed on the actual contact data
stealing module.
It indeed dumps the user’s entire contact list in a name-number pair format (e.g. “John
Oliver: 1234567890”), concatenates pairs into a giant string, and then ﬁnally sends it out to
a remote server.
Examining user contacts to understand a user’s social network is a popular marketing
research method found in many advertisement SDKs. In order to protect user privacy,
however, a legitimate SDK usually only collects contact names or numbers. Some even
adopt a cryptographic approach to generate unique hash of name-number combinations
so that the actual data is not collected at all.
Massively uploading identiﬁable contact details, though, is unacceptable and in many
countries constitutes a violation of data privacy regulations.
The Exception to the Rule
Interestingly, the SDK developer seems to ignore old Android devices below Marshmallow
on purpose. According to Google, Android Marshmallow and above represent 70% of
Android devices. From an operational perspective, it seems to be a time and money
saving trade-off that SWAnalytics made by avoiding to prolong compatibility support in
order to keep its malicious code simple.
Furthermore, we also observed a mysterious data stealing exemption. If it is a Meitu
Phone, SWAnalytics will not collect the user’s contacts data at all.
Network Speed Master’s Code
Upon establishing its malicious nature, we expanded our analysis scope to Network
Speed Master’s overall code base.

Figure 4: The user contacts stealing code which interestingly only targets newer Androids.
It turns out that contacts data isn’t the only unusual data SWAnalytics is interested in.
SWAnalytics also has a “smart” approach to collect the user’s QQ login data. (QQ is one
of most popular instant messaging application in China. Both QQ and WeChat belong to
Tencent.)

Figure 5: Entry of data stealing code with Meitu phone exemption
The Man-in-the-Disk Connection
With default settings, SWAnalytics will scan through an Android device’s external storage,
looking for directory “tencent/MobileQQ/WebViewCheck”. This folder hosts QQ login data
chache. By listing sub-folders, SWAnalytics is able to infer QQ accounts which have never
been used on the device.
In Slava Makkaveev’s Man-in-the-Disk research, he discussed the risk of hosting sensitive
application data in publicly accessible external storage. Operation Sheep is the ﬁrst
campaign we have observed in the wild that abuses similar concept since our MitD
publication.

Figure 6: Code to scan QQ login details
To make this data harvesting operation ﬂexible, SWAnalytics equips the ability to receive
and process conﬁguration ﬁles from a remote Command-and-Control server. Whenever
users reboot their device or open up Network Speed Master, SWAnalytics will fetch the
latest conﬁguration ﬁle from “http[:]//mbl[.]shunwang[.]com/cfg/conﬁg[.]json”.

Figure 7: The latest conﬁguration ﬁle from the C&C server
“gps_timeout” deﬁnes the time interval (in milliseconds) between the device’s GPS
coordinates tracking attempts. Currently it leaks user geolocation every ﬁve seconds,
which is a concerning behavior. “system_app” is a Boolean value which can be either 0
(false, do not include system applications in the device application list and send to C&C
server) or 1 (true, include system applications). “info_address” is the directory
SWAnalytics uses to search for QQ login details. “bs_time” deﬁnes time interval in
seconds to leak all captured device data. It is also the check interval to make sure the data
stealing process is alive. Currently, the data stealing process wakes up every 15 minutes.

Figure 8: the code to process the conﬁguration ﬁle fetched from C&C server
The ﬁnal part of Operation Sheep is to send data to Shun Wang’s C&C servers. Given the
vast amount of data SWAnalytics leaks, it breaks down messages to C&C servers into ﬁve
categories denoted by four digit numbers:
Message
code

Usage

1001

Device information including geo-location, MAC address, installed application list,
phone brand and model

1002

User contacts and QQ login list

1003

Current running applications

1005

UMENG_KEY (popular Chinese advertisement SDK Umeng) heartbeat

1006

Running process list and PID (process ID)

Each data message sent to the C&C server follows the format of:

To make sure the data is only readable to Shun Wang servers, SWAnalytics applies DES
encryption twice. It uses the master encryption key “#dc?*-y1” to encrypt data before it’s
sent to C&C server. In order to hide the master key, SWAnalytics uses another hard-coded
passcode “123456” to encrypt its master key.

The Hunt
Upon concluding Network Speed Master’s malicious behaviors, it was time to look for the
big picture. During several months of investigation and continuous monitoring, we
discovered 12 applications infested with SWAnalytics published in various channels.
Because of the high segmentation of Android application publishing channels in China,
this table is not an exhaustive list. Our research looked into 360 Qihoo Appstore, Baidu
Appstore, Huawei Appstore, Tencent MyApp, Wandoujia, and Xiaomi Appstore. By the
time of this publication, there’s no sign indicating SWAnalytics has penetrated Google Play
yet.

In order to understand SWAnalytics’ impact, we turned to public download volume data
available on Chandashi, one of the app store optimization vendors specialized in Chinese
mobile application markets.
We derived a monthly new installation volume of six popular applications of interest. Data
points span from September 2018 to January 2019 where we observed over 17 million
downloads in just ﬁve months. Most of the infected applications maintained a solid monthon-month growth rate with already huge user bases, and although the new download
volume does not necessarily result in an exact number of unique and freshly infected user
numbers, we believe it does signal large scale compromise and a growing threat to users.

Figure 11: data derived from chandashi.com, excluding Xiaomi Appstore.
The Value of Personal Contact Information
Compared to ﬁnancial data and government issued ID document information, personal
contact information is often treated as less sensitive data. According to popular belief, it
requires extra effort to exploit such data while potential proﬁts do not match a hacker’s
effort. Hence it is unlikely to be targeted. However, the landscape is changing with deep
specialization in underground markets and new “business models” available to proﬁt from
such personal contact data.

In 2018, intense competition among internet companies created a rush of new user
acquisitions. It resulted in waves of cellphone number-based friend referral programs. In
China alone, we have seen underground market “sheep shavers” ported SMS rogue
marketing strategy to spread Alipay Red Packet referral URL links. When receivers click
on these referral links, both the sender and receiver receives a small amount of credit in
their Alipay accounts.
In 2019 new year trend predictions, multiple media outlets such as the BBC’s ‘Business
Matters’ program and Forbes mentioned the online retail sector could expect great
competition. In South East Asia alone, for example, Amazon, Alibaba backed Lazada and
Shopee will each directly face-off against each other in regional markets.
Indeed, during 2018’s year-end December sales promotion, Lazada already adopted the
Alipay style referral program. In the same way, similar marketing campaigns are expected
from competing vendors in 2019. As a result, this malicious trend in the mobile arena will
fuel sheep shavers’ interest in carrying out similar cyber operations in regional markets
outside of China.
Figure 12: Lazada referral reward during December 2018’s end of year sales promotion
In a heuristic view, Operation Sheep presents a rising security threat from 3rd party SDKs.
In Operation Sheep’s case, Shun Wang likely harvests end user contact lists without
application developer acknowledgement. This behavior does not beneﬁt end users nor
application developers. Rigorous code review is needed to prevent such pilfering behavior
in so-called data analytics SDKs.
During our investigation, BuzzFeed News reported alleged advertisement fraud from
Cheetah Mobile SDK too. According to Cheetah Mobile’s follow-up investigation,
fraudulent behaviors came from two 3rd party SDKs (Batmobi, Duapps) integrated inside
Cheetah SDK. Both these cases should be loud reminders to application developers in
2019 that before integrating SDKs into their mobile applications developers need to be
aware of potential risks of undocumented and malicious behaviors implemented in 3rd
party SDKs.
Mitigation
Users are strongly advised to uninstall bespoke applications immediately. Stolen data is
transmitted via HTTP protocol. It means not only that Shun Wang gets the victim’s data
but that a malicious 3rd party can also intercept and acquire it.

顺手牵羊

Operation Sheep: Pilfer-Analytics SDK in Action - Check Point Research

“
” a Chinese idiom which
can be directly translated in English
as “taking the opportunity to pilfer a
sheep”, originates from an ancient
Chinese essay named Thirty-Six
Stratagems. In modern days, it
refers to stealing properties of small
value when the owner is not paying
attention or at disadvantage.

薅羊毛

“
” is a Chinese slang that
translates in English as “shaving a
sheep in a subtle way that it won’t
be noticed”. It refers to the practice
of acquiring small unlawful income
in a quick manner and on a large
scale, hoping to accumulate
considerable gain. In the internet
age, it describes a multi-million
dollar worth underground market of
proﬁting by abusing various reward
systems or freebie marketing
promotions provided by vendors to
reward brand loyalty or expand a
customer base.
