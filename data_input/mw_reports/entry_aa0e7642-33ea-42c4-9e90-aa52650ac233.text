This article is part of The 5×5, a monthly series by the Cyber Statecraft Initiative, in which
five featured experts answer five questions on a common theme, trend, or current event in
the world of cyber. Interested in the 5×5 and want to see a particular topic, event, or question
covered? Contact Simon Handler with the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at [email protected].
Just over one year ago, on February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of
neighboring Ukraine. The ensuing conflict, Europe’s largest since World War II, has not only
besieged Ukraine physically, but also through the information environment. Through kinetic,
cyber, and influence operations, Russia has placed Ukraine’s digital and physical information
infrastructure—including its cell towers, networks, data, and the ideas that traverse them—in
its crosshairs as it seeks to cripple Ukraine’s defenses and bring its population under
Russian control.
Given the privately owned underpinnings of the cyber and information domains by
technology companies, a range of local and global companies have played a significant role
in defending the information environment in Ukraine. From Ukrainian telecommunications
operators to global cloud and satellite internet providers, the private sector has been woven
into Ukrainian defense and resilience. For example, Google’s Threat Analysis Group
reported having disrupted over 1,950 instances in 2022 of Russian information operations
aimed at degrading support for Ukraine, undermining its government, and building support
for the war within Russia. The present conflict in Ukraine offers lessons for states as well as
private companies on why public-private cooperation is essential to building resilience in this
space, and how these entities can work together more effectively.
We brought together a group of experts to provide insights on the war being waged through
the Ukrainian information environment and take away lessons for the United States and its
allies for the future.
#1 How has conflict in the information environment associated with the war in Ukraine
compared to your prior expectations?

1/8

Nika Aleksejeva, resident fellow, Baltics, Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), Atlantic
Council:
“As the war in Ukraine started, everyone was expecting to see Russia conducting offensive
information influence operations targeting Europe. Yes, we have identified and researched
Russia’s coordinated information influence campaigns on Meta’s platforms and Telegram.
These campaigns targeted primarily European countries, and their execution was
unprofessional, sloppy, and without much engagement on respective platforms.”
Silas Cutler, senior director for cyber threat research, Institute for Security and Technology
(IST):
“A remarkable aspect of this conflict has been how Ukraine has maintained communication
with the rest of the world. In the days leading up to the conflict, there was a significant
concern that Russia would disrupt Ukraine’s ability to report on events as they unfolded.
Instead of losing communication, Ukraine has thrived while continuously highlighting through
social media its ingenuity within the conflict space. Both the mobilization of its technical
workforce through the volunteer IT_Army and its ability to leverage consumer technology,
such as drones, have shown the incredible resilience and creativity of the Ukrainian people.”
Roman Osadchuk, research associate, Eurasia, Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab),
Atlantic Council:
“The information environment was chaotic and tense even before the invasion, as Russia
waged a hybrid war since at least the annexation of Crimea and war in Eastern Ukraine in
2014. Therefore, the after-invasion dynamic did not bring significant surprises, but intensified
tension and resistance from Ukrainian civil society and government toward Russia’s attempts
to explain its unprovoked invasion and muddle the water around its war crimes. The only
things that exceeded expectations were the abuse of fact-checking toolbox WarOnFakes and
the intensified globalization of the Kremlin’s attempts to tailor messages about the war to
their favor globally.”
Emma Schroeder, associate director, Cyber Statecraft Initiative, Digital Forensic Research
Lab (DFRLab), Atlantic Council:
“The information environment has been a central space and pathway throughout which this
war is being fought. Russian forces are reaching through that space to attack and spread
misinformation, as well as attacking the physical infrastructure underpinning this
environment. The behavior, while novel in its scale, is the continuation of Russian strategy in
Crimea, and is very much living up to expectations set in that context. What has surpassed
expectations is the effectiveness of Ukrainian defenses, in coordination with allies and
private sector partners. The degree to which the international community has sprung forward
to provide aid and assistance is incredible, especially in the information environment where
such global involvement can be so immediate and transformative.”
2/8

Gavin Wilde, senior fellow, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace:
“The volume and intensity of cyber and information operations has roughly been in line with
my prior expectations, though the degree of private and commercial activity was something
that I might not have predicted a year ago. From self-selecting out of the Russian market to
swarming to defend Ukrainian networks and infrastructure, the outpouring of support from
Western technology and cybersecurity firms was not on my bingo card. Sustaining it and
modeling for similar crises are now key.”

#2 What risks do private companies assume in offering support or partnership to
states engaged in active conflict?
Aleksejeva: “Fewer and fewer businesses are betting on Russia’s successful economical
future. Additionally, supporting Russia in this conflict in any way is morally unacceptable for
most Western companies. Chinese and Iranian companies are different. As for Ukraine,
supporting it is morally encouraged, but is limited by many practicalities, such as supply
chain disruptions amid Russia’s attacks.”
Cutler: “By providing support during conflict, companies risk becoming a target themselves.
Technology companies such as Microsoft, SentinelOne, and Cloudflare, which have publicly
reported their support for Ukraine, have been historically targeted by Russian cyber
operations and are already familiar with the increased risk. Organizations with pre-conflict
commercial relationships may fall under new scrutiny by nationally-aligned hacktivist groups
such as Killnet. This support for one side over the other—whether actual or perceived—may
result in additional risk.”
Osadchuk: “An important risk of continuing business as usual [in Russia] is that it may
damage a company’s public image and test its declared values, since the continuation of
paying taxes within the country-aggressor makes the private company a sponsor of these
actions. Another risk for a private company is financial, since the companies that leave a
particular market are losing their profits, but this is incomparable to human suffering and
losses caused by the aggression. In the case of a Russian invasion, one of the ways to stop
the war is to cut funding for and, thus, undermine the Russian war machine and support
Ukraine.”
Schroeder: “Private companies have long provided goods and services to combatants
outside of the information environment. The international legal framework restricting
combatants to targeting ‘military objects’ provides normative protection, as objects are
defined as those ‘whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the
circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage’ in a manner proportional
to the military gain foreseen by the operation. This definition, however, is still subject to the
realities of conflict, wherein combatants will make those decisions to their own best
3/8

advantage. In the information environment, this question becomes more complicated, as
cyber products and services often do not fall neatly within standard categories and where
private companies themselves own and operate the very infrastructure over and through
which combatants engage. The United States and its allies, whether on a unilateral of
supranational basis, work to better define the boundaries of civilian ‘participation’ in war and
conflict, as the very nature of the space means that their involvement will only increase.”
Wilde: “On one hand, it is important not to falsely mirror onto others the constraints of
international legal and normative frameworks around armed conflict to which responsible
states strive to adhere. Like Russia, some states show no scruples about violating these
frameworks in letter or spirit, and seem unlikely to be inhibited by claims of neutrality from
companies offering support to victimized states. That said, clarity about where goods and
services might be used for civilian versus military objectives is advisable to avoid the
thresholds of ‘direct participation’ in war outlined in International Humanitarian Law.”
#3 What useful lessons should the United States and its allies take away from the
successes and/or failures of cyber and information operations in Ukraine?
Aleksejeva: “As for cyber operations, so far, we have not seen successful disruptions
achieved by Russia of Ukraine and its Western allies. Yes, we are seeing constant attacks,
but cyber defense is much more developed on both sides than before 2014. As for
information operations, the United States and its allies should become less self-centered and
have a clear view of Russia’s influence activities in the so-called Global South where much of
the narratives are rooted in anti-Western sentiment.”
Cutler: “Prior to the start of the conflict, it was strongly believed that a cyber operation,
specifically against energy and communication sectors, would act as a precursor to kinetic
action. While a WannaCry or NotPetya-scale attack did not occur, the AcidRain attack
against the Viasat satellite communication network and other attacks targeting Ukraine’s
energy sector highlight that cyber operations of varying effectiveness will play a role in the
lead up to a military conflict.”
Osadchuk: “First, cyber operations coordinate with other attack types, like kinetic operations
on the ground, disinformation, and influence operations. Therefore, cyberattacks might be a
precursor of an upcoming missile strike, information operation, or any other action in the
physical and informational dimensions, so allies could use cyber to model and analyze multidomain operations. Finally, preparation for and resilience to information and cyber operations
are vital in mitigating the consequences of such attacks; thus, updating defense doctrines
and improving cyber infrastructure and social resilience are necessary.”
Schroeder: “Expectations for operations in this environment have exposed clear fractures in
the ways that different communities define as success in a wartime operation. Specifically,
there is a tendency to equate success with direct or kinetic battlefield impact. One of the
biggest lessons that has been both a success and a failure throughout this war is the role
4/8

that this environment can play. Those at war, from ancient to modern times, have leveraged
every asset at their disposal and chosen the tool they see as the best fit for each challenge
that arises—cyber is no different. While there is ongoing debate surrounding this question, if
cyber operations have not been effective on a battlefield, that does not mean that cyber is
ineffective, just that expectations were misplaced. Understanding the myriad roles that cyber
can and does play in defense, national security, and conflict is key to creating an effective
cross-domain force.
Wilde: “Foremost is the need to check the assumption that these operations can have
decisive utility, particularly in a kinetic wartime context. Moscow placed great faith in its ability
to convert widespread digital and societal disruption into geopolitical advantage, only to find
years of effort backfiring catastrophically. In other contexts, better trained and resourced
militaries might be able to blend cyber and information operations into combined arms
campaigns more effectively to achieve discrete objectives. However, it is worth reevaluating
the degree to which we assume offensive cyber and information operations can reliably be
counted on to play pivotal roles in hot war.”
More from the Cyber Statecraft Initiative:
#4 How do comparisons to other domains of conflict help and/or hurt understanding
of conflict in the information domain?
Aleksejeva: “Unlike conventional warfare, information warfare uses information and
psychological operations during peace time as well. By masking behind sock puppet or
anonymous social media accounts, information influence operations might be perceived as
legitimate internal issues that polarize society. A country might be unaware that it is under
attack. At the same time, as the goal of conventional warfare is to break an adversary’s
defense line, information warfare fights societal resilience by breaking its unity. ‘Divide and
rule’ is one of the basic information warfare strategies.”
Cutler: “When looking at the role of cyber in this conflict, I think it is critical to examine the
history of Hacktivist movements. This can be incredibly useful for understanding the
influences and capabilities of groups like the IT_Army and Killnet.”
Osadchuk: “The information domain sometimes reflects the kinetic events on the ground, so
comparing these two is helpful and could serve as a behavior predictor. For instance, when
the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberate new territories, they also expose war crimes, civilian
casualties, and damages inflicted by occupation forces. In reaction to these revelations, the
Kremlin propaganda machine usually launches multiple campaigns to distance themselves,
blame the victim, or even denounce allegations as staged to muddy the waters for certain
observers.”

Schroeder: “It is often tricky to carry comparisons over different environments and context,
but the practice persists because, well, that is just what people do—look for patterns. The
ability to carry over patterns and lessons is essential, especially in new environments and
with the constant developments of new tools and technologies. Where these comparisons
cause problems is when they are used not as a starting point, but as a predetermined
answer.”
Wilde: “It is problematic, in my view, to consider information a warfighting ‘domain,’
particularly because its physical and metaphorical boundaries are endlessly vague and
evolving—certainly relative to air, land, sea, and space. The complexities and contingencies
in the information environment are infinitely more than those in the latter domains. However
talented we may be at collecting and analyzing millions of relevant datapoints with advanced
technology, these capabilities may lend us a false sense of our ability to control or subvert
the information environment during wartime—from hearts and minds to bits and bytes.”
#5 What conditions might make the current conflict exceptional and not
generalizable?
Aleksejeva: “This war is neither ideological nor a war for territories and resources. Russia
does not have any ideology that backs up its invasion of Ukraine. It also has a hard time
maintaining control of its occupied territories. Instead, Russia has many disinformation-based
narratives or stories that justify the invasion to as many Russian citizens as possible
including Kremlin officials. Narratives are general and diverse enough, so everyone can find
an explanation of the current invasion—be it the alleged rebirth of Nazism in Ukraine, the
fight against US hegemony, or the alleged historical right to bring Ukraine back to Russia’s
sphere of influence. Though local, the war has global impact and makes countries around
the world pick sides. Online and social media platforms, machine translation tools, and big
data products provide a great opportunity to bombard any internet user in any part of the
world with pro-Russia massaging often tailored to echo historical, racial, and economic
resentments especially rooted in colonial past.”
Cutler: “During the Gulf War, CNN and other cable news networks were able to provide live
coverage of military action as it was unfolding. Now, real-time information from conflict areas
is more broadly accessible. Telegram and social media have directly shaped the information
and narratives from the conflict zone.”
Osadchuk: “The main difference is the enormous amount of war content, ranging from
professional pictures and amateur videos after missile strikes to drone footage of artillery
salvos and bodycam footage of fighting in the frontline trenches—all making this conflict the
most documented. Second, this war demonstrates the need for drones, satellite imagery, and
open-source intelligence for successful operations, which distances it from previous conflicts
and wars. Finally, it is exceptional due to the participation of Ukrainian civil society in

6/8

developing applications, like the one alerting people about incoming shelling or helping find
shelter; launching crowdfunding campaigns for vehicles, medical equipment, and even
satellite image services; and debunking Russian disinformation on social media.”
Schroeder: “One of the key lessons we can take from this war is the centrality of the global
private sector to conflict in and through the information environment. From expedited
construction of cloud infrastructure for the Ukrainian government to Ukrainian
telecommunications companies defending and restoring services along the front lines to
distributed satellite devices, providing flexible connectivity to civilians and soldiers alike,
private companies have undoubtedly played an important role in shaping both the
capabilities of the Ukrainian state and the information battlespace itself. While we do not
entirely understand the incentives that drove these actions, an undeniable motivation that will
be difficult to replicate in other contexts is the combination of Russian outright aggression
and comparative economic weakness. Companies and their directors felt motivated to act
due to the first and, likely, free to act due to the second. Private sector centrality is unlikely to
diminish and, in future conflicts, it will be imperative for combatants to understand the
opportunities and dependencies that exist in this space within their own unique context.”
Wilde: “My sense is that post-war, transatlantic dynamics—from shared norms to politicomilitary ties—lent significant tailwinds to marshal resource and support to Ukraine (though
not as quickly or amply from some quarters as I had hoped). The shared memory of the fight
for self-determination in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s to early 1990s still has
deep resonance among the publics and capitals of the West. These are unique dynamics,
and the degree to which they could be replicated in other theaters of potential conflict is a
pretty open question.”
