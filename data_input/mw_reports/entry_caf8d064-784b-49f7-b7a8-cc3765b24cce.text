Executive Summary
Unit 42 researchers have observed an uptick in Clop ransomware activity affecting the
wholesale and retail, transportation and logistics, education, manufacturing, engineering,
automotive, energy, financial, aerospace, telecommunications, professional and legal
services, healthcare and high tech industries in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and
Latin America. Clop also leverages double extortion practices and hosts a leak site, where
the number of victims has grown significantly since its launch in March 2020. Clop has been
commonly observed being delivered as the final-stage payload of a malicious spam

campaign carried out by the financially motivated actor TA505. This ransomware has also
been linked to threat actors behind the recent global zero-day attacks on users of the
Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) product.
Due to the surge of this malicious activity, we’ve created this threat assessment for overall
threat awareness. Full visualization of the techniques observed and their relevant courses of
action can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.

Clop Ransomware Overview
Clop ransomware is a variant of a previously known strain called CryptoMix. In 2019, Clop
was delivered as the final payload of a phishing campaign associated with the financially
motivated actor TA505. The threat actors would send phishing emails that would lead to a
macro-enabled document that would drop a loader named Get2. This loader can download
different tools used by this group, such as SDBot, FlawedAmmy or FlawedGrace. After the
threat actors obtain the initial foothold on the system, they start employing reconnaissance,
lateral movement and exfiltration techniques to prepare the ransomware deployment. SDBot
has been observed delivering Clop as the final payload.
After the ransomware is executed, Clop appends the .clop extension to the victim's files. We
have observed different variants using different extensions, such as “.CIIp”, “.Cllp” and
“.C_L_O_P”. Different versions of the ransom note have also been observed after
encryption. Depending on the variant, any of these ransom text files could drop:
“ClopReadMe.txt”, “README_README.txt”, “Cl0pReadMe.txt“ and “READ_ME_!!!.TXT”.
This ransomware includes various features to avoid detection. Observed Clop samples try to
kill several processes and services related to backups and security solutions. It won’t
execute if it detects it’s running in a virtual environment. Clop also leverages Code Signing to
evade detection. We observed the use of two signers during our research, as shown below
in Figure 1.

Clop went from being ransomware delivered through malicious spam to being used in
targeted campaigns against high-profile companies. In recent events, Clop has been linked
to threat actors who have been exploiting Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA)
vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-27101, CVE-2021-27102, CVE-2021-27103 and CVE-2021-27104.
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities led to the compromise of high-profile companies
starting in February. Additionally, there has been evidence of an affiliate using a webshell
named DEWMODE that was being used to steal data from Accellion FTA devices. Not long
after compromise, victims affected by DEWMODE began receiving emails from threat actors
announcing the breach with an unique URL per victim to start negotiation efforts. If ignored,
the threat actors would reach out again with an ultimatum of releasing the data to “Cl0p^_Leaks”.
Clop didn't have a leak site when it was first sighted back in February 2019. It was in March
2020 when the threat actors decided to launch a leak site titled, “Cl0p^_- Leaks” (Figure 2).
This website is a Tor-based blog site, where victims who don’t pay the ransom or ignore
threats have their confidential data publicly exposed. The threat actors behind Clop also
leverage a variety of extortion techniques, such as targeting workstations of top executives,
“doxxing” employees and advertising their breaches to reporters.

Conclusion

6/7

Clop ransomware is a high-profile ransomware family that has compromised industries
globally. Organizations should be aware of SDBot, used by TA505, and how it can lead to the
deployment of Clop ransomware. Like many other current ransomware families, Clop hosts a
leak site to create additional pressure and shame victims into paying the ransom.
Indicators associated with this Threat Assessment are available on GitHub, have been
published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed and are viewable via the ATOM Viewer.
In addition to the above courses of action, AutoFocus customers can review additional
activity by using the tag Clop.
