What makes Povlsomware notable is not what it has already accomplished — there have been few, if any, notable incidents involving the
malware at the time of writing — but how it can potentially be used. Although ostensibly advertised as an “educational” tool, its access to
Cobalt Strike capabilities and its open-source nature make it a potentially dangerous malware in the hands of an experienced ransomware
operator.
Ransomware attacks can come in many forms. At the simplest end of the spectrum, you have infection vectors such as phishing emails that
will deploy the malware if the user accesses them. More complicated campaigns, on the other hand, might make use of complex infrastructure
involving the use of tools such as Cobalt Strike or Mimikatz as part of the infection routine.
Given the wide array of tools and techniques that ransomware operators use, organizations and individual users have to be vigilant on all
fronts to protect their machines and systems from ransomware attacks. The following security best practices can help with this:
Limiting access to shared network drives and turning off file sharing lessens the probability that a ransomware infection spreads to other
devices.
Employing authentication options that include multi-factor authentication strengthens the security of user accounts, minimizing opportunities
for account theft or compromise.
Enforcing the principle of least privilege — where users only have access to the sections of the system that they need— can help prevent
attackers from running tools and software used by ransomware.
Using application controls can help prevent attacks that leverage remote access software.
Regular patching and updating of software and systems reduce the chance for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability that is part of the
infection routine.
Regularly backing up files, preferably using the 3-2-1 rule, still remains an effective method of protecting data in the event of a successful
ransomware infection.
Organizations can also take advantage of security technologies such as Trend Micro XDRTM, which collects and correlates data across
endpoints, emails, cloud workloads, and networks to provide better context to attacks in a single console. This allows security and IT teams to
respond to ransomware and other threats faster and more effectively.
