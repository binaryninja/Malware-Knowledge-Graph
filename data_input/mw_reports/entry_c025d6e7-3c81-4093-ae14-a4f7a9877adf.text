Iranian Spies Accidentally Leaked Videos of Themselves

When security researchers piece together the blow-by-blow of a state-sponsored hacking
operation, they're usually following a thin trail of malicious code samples, network logs, and
connections to faraway servers. That detective work gets significantly easier when hackers
record what they‚Äôre doing and upload the video to an unprotected server on the open
internet. Which is precisely what a group of Iranian hackers may have unwittingly done.
Researchers at IBM‚Äôs X-Force security team revealed today that they've obtained roughly
five hours of video footage that appears to have been recorded directly from the screens of
hackers working for a group IBM calls ITG18, and which other security firms refer to as
APT35 or Charming Kitten. It's one of the most active state-sponsored espionage teams
linked to the government of Iran. The leaked videos were found among 40 gigabytes of data
that the hackers had apparently stolen from victim accounts, including US and Greek military
personnel. Other clues in the data suggest that the hackers targeted US State Department
staff and an unnamed Iranian-American philanthropist.
The IBM researchers say they found the videos exposed due to a misconfiguration of
security settings on a virtual private cloud server they'd observed in previous APT35 activity.
The files were all uploaded to the exposed server over a few days in May, just as IBM was
monitoring the machine. The videos appear to be training demonstrations the Iran-backed

hackers made to show junior team members how to handle hacked accounts. They show the
hackers accessing compromised Gmail and Yahoo Mail accounts to download their contents,
as well as exfiltrating other Google-hosted data from victims.
This sort of data exfiltration and management of hacked accounts is hardly sophisticated
hacking. It's more the kind of labor-intensive but relatively simple work that's necessary in a
large-scale phishing operation. But the videos nonetheless represent a rare artifact, showing
a first-hand view of state-sponsored cyberspying that's almost never seen outside of an
intelligence agency.
"We don't get this kind of insight into how threat actors operate really ever," says Allison
Wikoff, a senior analyst at IBM X-Force whose team discovered the videos. "When we talk
about observing hands-on activity, it‚Äôs usually from incident-response engagements or
endpoint monitoring tools. Very rarely do we actually see the adversary on their own desktop.
It's a whole other level of 'hands-on-keyboard' observation."
"Nothing was off-limits."

In two videos IBM showed to WIRED on the condition that they not be published, the hackers
demonstrate the workflow for siphoning data out of a hacked account. In one video, the
hacker logs into a compromised Gmail account‚Äîa dummy account for the demonstration‚Äî
by plugging in credentials from a text document, and links it to the email software Zimbra,
designed to manage multiple accounts from a single interface, using Zimbra to download the
account's entire inbox to the hacker's machine. Then the hacker quickly deletes the alert in
the victim's Gmail that says their account permissions have been changed. Next the hacker
downloads the victim's contacts and photos from their Google account too. A second video
shows a similar workflow for a Yahoo account.

The most telling element of the video, Wikoff says, is the speed the hacker demonstrates in
exfiltrating the accounts' information in real time. The Google account's data is stolen in
around four minutes. The Yahoo account takes less than three minutes. In both cases, of
course, a real account populated with tens or hundreds of gigabytes of data would take far
longer to download. But the clips demonstrate how quickly that download process is set up,
Wikoff says, and suggest that the hackers are likely carrying out this sort of personal data
theft on a mass scale. "To see how adept they are at going in and out of all these different
webmail accounts and setting them up to exfiltrate, it is just amazing," says Wikoff. "It‚Äôs a
well-oiled machine."

In some cases, IBM's researchers could see in the video that the same dummy accounts
were also themselves being used to send phishing emails, with bounced emails to invalid
addresses appearing in the accounts' inboxes. The researchers say those bounced emails
revealed some of the APT35 hackers' targeting, including American State Department staff
as well as an Iranian-American philanthropist. It's not clear if either target was successfully
phished. The dummy Yahoo account also briefly shows the phone number linked with it,
which begins with Iran's +98 country code.
In other videos the IBM researchers declined to show to WIRED, the researchers say the
hackers appeared to be combing through and exfiltrating data from real victims' accounts,
rather than ones they created for training purposes. One victim was a member of the US
Navy, and another was a two-decade veteran of the Greek Navy. The researchers say the
APT35 hackers appear to have stolen photos, emails, tax records, and other personal
information from both targeted individuals.

In some clips, the researchers say they observed the hackers working through a text
document full of usernames and passwords for a long list of non-email accounts, from phone
carriers to bank accounts, as well as some as trivial as pizza delivery and music-streaming
services. "Nothing was off-limits," Wikoff says. The researchers note that they didn't see any
evidence that the hackers were able to bypass two-factor authentication, however. When an
account was secured with any second form of authentication, the hackers simply moved on
to the next one on their list.
The sort of targeting that IBM's findings reveal fits with previous known operations tied to
APT35, which has carried out espionage on behalf of Iran for years, most often with phishing
attacks as its first point of intrusion. The group has focused on government and military
targets that represent a direct challenge to Iran, such as nuclear regulators and sanctions
bodies. More recently it has aimed its phishing emails at pharmaceutical companies involved
in Covid-19 research and President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.
It's hardly unprecedented for hackers to accidentally leave behind revealing tools or
documents on an unsecured server, points out former NSA staffer Emily Crose, who now
works as a researcher for the security firm Dragos. But Crose says she's not aware of any
public instance of actual videos of state-sponsored hackers' own operations being left for
investigators, as in this case. And given that the hacked accounts likely also contain
evidence of how they were compromised, she says the leaked videos may well force the
Iranian hackers to change some of their tactics. "This kind of thing is a rare win for the
defenders," Crose says. "It's like playing poker and having your opponents lay their entire
hand out flat on the table in the middle of the last flop."

Even so, IBM says it doesn't expect its discovery of the APT35 videos to slow down the pace
of the hacking group's operations. After all, it had nearly a hundred of its domains seized by
Microsoft last year. "They simply rebuilt and kept going," says Wikoff. If that sort of
infrastructure purge didn't slow down the Iranians, she says, don't expect a bit of videoleaked exposure to, either.
