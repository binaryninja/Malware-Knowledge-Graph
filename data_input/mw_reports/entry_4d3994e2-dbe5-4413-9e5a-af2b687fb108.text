Summary:
Lately I’ve been looking at a lot of maldocs. I’ve found all sorts of malware some of which I
could not even identify. The problem is by the time I get around to blogging it, someone else
has inevitable posted about it. For example this blog I have been preparing for the last few
hours on and off yet someone has tweeted the document.
I originally found this document from an email. Out of all the emails that I had, this sample of
Loda Logger was probably the most interesting (not Loki or Formbook, etc.).
I have been using any.run lately as I find it really quite good and the ability to interact with it
is very useful.
This blog just gives a little more info to what is already available from the any.run run that I
did.

Background:

Downloads:
The run was done using any.run and hopefully you can download any files you want to look
at from it. If not though let me know.

Overview:

Analysis:
The maldoc came attached to a phishing email asking me to confirm receipt of a payment.
2/5

It had relatively few detections on VT at the time of submission.
SHA256:

I believe the doc exploits CVE-2017-0199 which drops and runs a “.sct” file which is actually
a scriplet.

3/5

The executable is added to Startup and copied to the folder
“C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\Skyp\CWAHLM.exe”
Finally after an ipcheck (with a AutoIt user agent), data is sent to the C2 which matched a
pattern for Loda Logger. According to Proofpoint’s article (link in the Background section) the
following data is sent:
Victim’s Country

4/5

A hard coded string (seen ‘victim’, ‘Clientv4’)
Victim’s IP address
User account name
Windows version
Windows architecture (X64 or X86)
Webcam installed (Yes or No, enumerated using capGetDriverDescription from
Avicap32.dll)
Installed AV Vendor (enumerated via running process names)
Malware version, i.e. 1.0.1
Hard coded string (seen ‘ddd’)
Monitor resolution in a special format (“Pr[Height]X2[Width]X3”)
OS type (can be “laptop”, “Desktop”, or “x”, enumerated using the WMI query “Select *
from Win32_SystemEnclosure”)
Version (beta)

If you watch the any.run video you can see the mouse moving towards the end of the video
which was not something I was doing. So either someone else was looking at my run at the
same time or the threat actor was connected to the VM.
