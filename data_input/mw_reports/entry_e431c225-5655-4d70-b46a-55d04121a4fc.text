Remaining Tasks

•Tick Group is a threat actor that has been active in Korea and Japan for the past ten years!
•Question 1. Are they the same group?
- Existence of Malware Builder
- Same code reused

• Question 2. Connection to Tonto Team
- Some malware are simultaneously used
- Some infrastructures, such as C&C, are shared
- What is the connection between these Groups? - Collaboration? Same Group? Coincidence?

Collaboration

• Necessity of Cooperation and Collaboration
- Collaboration required between the researchers of Korea and Japan, who are experiencing similar active attacks.

- It’s important to disclose and share information.
- Cooperated with Japanese and Taiwanese analyst. (Thanks !)
-AhnLab will share relevant information with the members of industry
