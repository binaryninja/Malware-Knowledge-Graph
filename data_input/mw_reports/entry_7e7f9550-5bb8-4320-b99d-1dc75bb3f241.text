A Global Perspective of the SideWinder APT
Summary
AT&T Alien Labs has investigated the adversary group publicly known as SideWinder in order to historically
document its highly active campaigns and identify a more complete picture of targets, motivations, and
objectives. Through our investigation, we have uncovered a collection of activity targeting government and
business throughout South Asia and East Asia spanning many years. Our findings are primarily focused on
activity since 2017, however the group has been reportedly operating since at least 2012. Alien Labs along
with other security researchers have assessed with low to medium confidence that the group is operates in
support of India political interests based on targets, campaign timelines, technical characteristics of
command and control (C2) infrastructure and malware, association with other known India interest APTs, in
addition to past cyber threat intelligence reporting and our private telemetry.
SideWinder is a highly active adversary primarily making use of email spear phishing, document exploitation,
and DLL Side Loading techniques to evade detection and to deliver targeted implants. The adversary activity
remains at a consistent rate and AT&T Alien Labs recommends the deployment of detections and
retrospective analysis of shared indicators of compromise (IOCs) for past undetected activity. In this report
we are providing a timeline of known campaigns and their associated IOCs, in addition to a large number of
campaigns/IOCs which have not been previously reported or publicly identified.

Targets
The SideWinder APT has been targeting governments and businesses throughout South Asia and East Asia
spanning many years. Specifically, there is a recurring effort of targeting military and government
organizations. Primary targets of government and military targeting has been Pakistan, China, Nepal,
Afghanistan. There were also many smaller operations observed targeting other nations in the region, such as
Myanmar, Qatar, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.
We assess with moderate confidence that various businesses operating in the national defense technology,
scientific research, financial, energy, and mineral industries of the same nations were also targeted in
SideWinder campaigns. Its critical to acknowledge that this is not the complete picture of the group’s
operations, and they are likely conducting operations against other targets.
Our assessment of the targets are based on infrastructure design/naming trends, government notifications,
publicly available files unique to specific sources, phishing pages, previous public reporting, and Alien Labs
private telemetry.

Technical Campaign Details
Initial Access
SideWinder has been observed initiating attacks with spear phishing emails against their target organizations.
Attacks are primarily delivering malicious attachments, but credential phishing has also been a technique
used by the group. The December 2020 blog from Trend Micro does an excellent analysis of the phishing
websites. Ultimately, these websites are used to collection credentials and occasionally deliver similar files to
the attachments detailed below.

Email lures and their attachments or links are often uniquely crafted to the target organization, which include
content that the recipients would often expect to receive or benefit from reading. Since the group has
primarily targeted government and military organizations, email lures are often related to political events
and/or private documents generally considered standard for such organizations to receive. Figure 1 includes
a screenshot of the complete content from an April 2019 campaign phishing email (SHA256:
be71f2d17037a1a1fbbe8d7f3f4b45c72132a64224e3d3f13aa66a2249df9232) with attachment (SHA256:
ac4fd2681c3a9d087ff4cabb44b93753711e81c6574c837ca33f74fef37f3cf4).

Figure 1. SideWinder Phishing Email Screenshot captured via VirusTotal.

Malicious attachments are the standard approach over the use of malicious links in phishing emails.
Attachments have most commonly been RTF files, and less commonly DOCX, LNK, and ZIP files.
Code Execution
The RTF files continually use CVE-2017-11882 to exploit the target host and initiate the compromise. LNK files
are used for code execution to download remote files from adversary-controlled infrastructure. ZIP files have
been observed simply as a way to supply LNK files, potentially an attempt to evade automatic email filtering.
One example of a ZIP to LNK delivery method was also detailed in the Government of Pakistan’s NTISB
advisory No. 22 of November 2019. The ZIP file contained a malicious LNK file (SHA256:
61669c7e59036ae95a2886cf5a42a89633ff8c53cf75e7cb89e0be9f6d4030f4) which performs a remote
download from paknavy.gov[.]pk.ap1-port[.]net/images/E7B62E1D/1182/2258/fc8fe2b4/692cd02
to ultimately download a malicious HTA file.

Figure 2. Scan of NTISB November 2019 Advisory, via National University of Technology Pakistan.

The HTA files themselves vary over the years, often evolving with each campaign in attempt to complicate
analysis and detection capabilities.
The HTA files generally have the same role in each campaign. This includes:
1. Act as the downloader to initialize the infection from the C2 server.
a. Further HTA Downloads (multistage) or direct loader DLL download and execution.
2. Load encoded lure document (such as PDFs).
a. Often a decoy document and shown to users while the attack is conducted without their
knowledge.
3. Report unique host details to C2 server.
a. Basic antivirus checks
The scripts shift between being JavaScript, PowerShell, and VBScript. Additionally, the amount of code
obfuscation and encoding within the script has increased over time. The scripts have also benefited from
using versions of open source toolkits such as Koadic and StarFighters to maliciously deliver the final payload.
Ultimately, the many unique implementations of the HTA file scripts lead to drop and execution of the loader
through the DLL side loading technique.

Trojan Analysis
DLL Side loading Execution Flow

As part of its infection chain, SideWinder is using a technique called DLL Side Loading to load and execute its
final implant payload on target machines. The malware is hijacking a clean file, by forcing a system program
to load its malicious DLL rather than its original one. This approach allows the implant to reside only in
memory of the victim machine, avoiding detection through generic file scans.

1. The script copies a clean system EXE file, which is often whitelisted from detection, to the malware
directory. In the case with various SideWinder methods, this would be the legitimate rekeywiz.exe
Windows OS application file (SHA256:
fa86b5bc5343ca92c235304b8dcbcf4188c6be7d4621c625564bebd5326ed850

2. Next the script sets its own DLL file name to the same as a clean file the application needs to load

during execution, which in this example is "Duser.dll". It is then placed into the same folder as the
clean application.
3. A configuration file is made for the system exe file to avoid conflicts with DLL file versions. (for
example: "rekeywiz.exe.config")

Figure 3: Directory containing clean application of the copied “rekeywiz.exe”, the malicious DLL “Duser.dll”, and the configuration file to avoid
version conflicts “rekeywiz.exe.conf”, captured via Alien Labs threat analysis.

Figure 4: Content of “regkeywiz.exe.conf”’ to avoid version conflict when loading ‘Duser.dll’, captured via Alien Labs threat analysis.

4. The script will execute the clean EXE file, which will then load and execute its malicious DLL as if it
were the original clean version, which itself decrypts and loads the final implant into memory.

Malicious DLL Analysis

Next, we can follow the execution of the new Duser.dll file through the DLL Side loading technique. Duser.dll
is responsible for decrypting and executing the final payload into memory, which has been written as a
randomly named temporary file (.tmp) on disk. This process is completed through the clean system
application used for the side-loading technique, regkeywiz.exe. The Duser.dll does not contain malicious code
by itself, but rather acts as a component to load the implant.

Figure 6: DLL reads the content of decrypted file ‘MpyutHk.tmp’ and execute it in the memory of the clean application “regkeywiz.exe”,
captured via Alien Labs threat analysis.

As mentioned, the content of the temporary file is the encrypted final and main payload of the infection
process. The first 32 bytes are the decryption key for a XOR loop. The function below can be used to decrypt
the file.
def decrypt(input_file, output_file):
f = open(input_file, 'rb')
data = f.read()
f.close()
file_length = len(data) - 32
xor_key = data[0:32]
arr = bytearray(data[32:])
for i in range(file_length):
arr[i] ^= xor_key[i % 32]
f = open(output_file, 'wb')
f.write(arr)
f.close()

Final Implant

As mentioned above, the implant is an encrypted temp file, which is initiated by the loader through the DLL
side loading technique, decrypted, and then executed.
The implant will save its configuration file in the original malware folder and decrypt it in memory. Similar to
the previous DLL, the first 32 bytes are the decryption key in XOR loop.
A decrypted configuration used by the implant, which includes the configuration file name, malware
directory, C2 server, file extensions to collect and more, can be seen in Figure 7:

The full malware configuration parameters used are shown below in their declaration state. We can notice
that in a switch statement if it does not have any C2, it will set one as default.
Following execution, two timer functions are set. The first timer function is responsible for querying the C2 to
get the new configuration needed for the malware and collect its associated information. After the first
request, it will start processing the commands it received by following configuration settings:

SideWinder Relations and Shared Resources
There are various links to other adversary groups observed during the investigation of SideWinder. AT&T
Alien Labs assesses with moderate confidence there is a close relationship between the reported Indiainterest APT known as PatchWork and SideWinder. This relationship can be identified by an overlap in actor
built C2 infrastructure. The October 2019 Android activity also presents an interesting anomaly for
SideWinder introducing potential links to PatchWork attack techniques and infrastructure.
Additionally, SideWinder was observed using a shared weaponizer toolkit. This shared toolkit has been
primarily referred to as the “Royal Road” or “8.t” Weaponizer. As noted in past reporting, many intriguing
links can be made to the various APT groups' use of it, such as Goblin Panda, APT40, and ICEFOG (Chinese
actors) and then later with SideWinder (potentially India). Such a shared exploit and weaponizer toolkit
provides a limited insight into the supply chain used between many APTs. From an analyst opinion, this may
mean the supply chain could be a central, for-profit organization, or there are potentially deliberate sharing
efforts between various state-sponsored organizations. Royal Road samples include:
892859ea9d86fc441b24222148db52eb33cd106c2ac68eafbe83ab0064215488
22062b6bcda194e3734285fed6b2de341c694c52a8f60c9f389f880cefab7644
9001056791a03ec998f26805d462bc2ca336b2c3aeac2e210f73ff841dfe3eec

Lastly, the July 12, 2020, findings from the Shadow Chaser Group introduced a potential additional clue of
links to a shared supply chain with the DarkHotel adversary group. Specifically, the unique variable
declarations and specific parameters used in CVE-2020-0674 exploits are similar.

Conclusion
After extensive investigation on the adversary group known as SideWinder, AT&T Alien Labs continues to
observe the group remaining highly active. SideWinder is targeting government and businesses in Asia with
use of phishing campaigns built for their specific targets. Through our investigation, we have uncovered a
collection of activity targeting government and business spanning many years. Alien Labs assesses with low
to medium confidence, the group is in support of India political interests based on targets, campaign
timelines, technical characteristics of C2 infrastructure and malware, association with known India based
APTs, in addition to past industry reporting and private telemetry.
We express gratitude to the many organizations and researchers for their public sharing of SideWinder
activity and recommend readers to make use of our Past Reporting Timeline in their own analysis and
conclusions.
