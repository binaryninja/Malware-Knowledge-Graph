Elephant Beetle: Uncovering an Organized FinancialTheft Operation
blog.sygnia.co/elephant-beetle-an-organized-financial-theft-operation

For the past two years, Sygnia’s Incident Response (IR) team has been methodically
tracking the Elephant Beetle threat group, an organized, significant financial-theft operation
threatening global enterprises.

key points
The Sygnia Incident Response team identified an organized and experienced threat
group siphoning off funds from businesses in the financial sector in Latin America.
Sygnia refers to this threat actor as 'Elephant Beetle' or TG2003.
This group operates undetected for long periods of time, patiently studying target
financial systems, creating fraudulent transactions hidden among regular activity, and
ultimately stealing millions of dollars.
Elephant Beetle is highly proficient with Java based attacks and, in many cases,
targets legacy Java applications running on Linux-based machines as a means of initial
entry to the environment.
While primarily focused in the Latin American market, Elephant Beetle can expand its
attacks to organizations worldwide, with our IR team already discovering a breach in
the Latin American operations of a U.S. company.
The full report includes the threat actor’s modus operandi, in-depth analysis of its
capabilities, and provides actionable insights, IOCs and guidelines for defending against the
attacks.

OVERVIEW
For the past two years, Sygnia’s Incident Response (IR) team has been tracking a financially
motivated threat group targeting and infiltrating organizations from the finance and
commerce sectors in Latin America. The attack is relentless, relying on simplicity to hide in
plain sight, without the need to develop sophisticated tools or exploits.
Using an arsenal of over 80 unique tools & scripts, the group executes its attacks patiently
over long periods of time, blending in with the target’s environment and going completely
undetected while it quietly liberates organizations of large amounts of money.
Elephant Beetle seems to primarily focus on Latin American targets, but that doesn’t mean
that organizations not based there are safe. For example, our IR team discovered that the
Latin American operations of a U.S. company had been breached. As such, both regional
and global organizations should be on their guard.
The group is highly proficient with Java based attacks and, in many cases, targets legacy
Java applications running on Linux-based machines as a means of initial entry to the
environment. Beyond that, the group even deploys their own complete Java web application
on victim machines to do their bidding while the machine also runs legitimate applications.
Elephant Beetle operates in a well-organized and stealthy pattern, efficiently executing each
phase of its attack plan once inside a compromised environment:

2/4

1. During the first phase, which can span up to a month, the group focuses on building
operational cyber capabilities in the compromised environment. The group studies
the digital landscape and plants backdoors while customizing its tools to work within
the victim environment.
2. The group then spends several months studying the victim’s environment, focusing
on the financial operation and identifying any flaws. During this stage, they observe
victim software and infrastructure to understand the technical process of legitimate
financial transactions.
3. The group then creates fraudulent transactions in the environment. These
transactions mimic legitimate behavior and siphon off incremental amounts of money
from the victim. Although the amount of money stolen in a single transaction may seem
insignificant, the group stacks numerous transactions to what amounts to millions of
dollars.
4. If during its efforts any theft activity is discovered and blocked, the group then simply
lays low for a few months only to return and target a different system.
