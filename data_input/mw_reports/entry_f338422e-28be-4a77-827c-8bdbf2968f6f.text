Author: Trend Micro

by Tamada Kiyotaka and MingYen Hsieh
Trend Micro discovered the ChessMaster campaign back in July
2017 as part of our monitoring efforts to protect our customers.
At the time, we found ChessMaster targeting different sectors
from the academe to media and government agencies in Japan.
The threat group used a variety of attack tools and techniques
to spy on their target organizations.
Back then, we noted that ChessMaster’s sophisticated nature
implied that the campaign could evolve, before finding changes
in the tools and tactics used in the campaign a few months
later. While the original campaign was comprehensive and used remote access Trojans (RATs)

such as ChChes and RedLeaves, this new campaign used a new backdoor (Detected by Trend
Micro as BKDR_ANEL.ZKEI) that leverages the CVE-2017-8759 vulnerability for its
cyberespionage activities.
In this blog post, we analyze ChessMaster’s current status, including the updated tools in its
arsenal — with a particular focus on the evolution of ANEL and how it is used in the campaign.

Figure 1. Infection Chain for the current ChessMaster campaign
ChessMaster’s current iteration starts off with the familiar phishing attacks seen in the earlier
campaigns that involved the use of an email with an attached malicious document using the doc,
docx, rtf, csv and msg formats. The email title and attached file name were written in Japanese and
contain general business, political, and economy-themed phrases such as
世界経済(World economy)
経済政策(economic policy)
予算概算要求(budget estimation request)
日米対話(Japan-US dialogue)
安倍再任(re-appointment of Prime Minister Abe)
連絡網(contact network)
職員採用案(staff recruitment plan)
会議(meeting)
However, there is a change in the exploit document. When we tracked ChessMaster back in
November, we noted that it exploited the SOAP WSDL parser vulnerability CVE-2017-8759
(patched in September 2017) within the Microsoft .NET framework to download additional malware.

Figure 5. Exploitation of Link Auto Update
ChessMaster can utilize any of these methods to download the next malware in the chain, the open
source post-exploitation tool known as “Koadic,” which the previous campaign also used. This tool
is responsible for stealing information — specifically the environment information — within the
target system.
Koadic executes the following command:
%comspec% /q /c <cmd> 1> <Output> 2>&1
The commands and output of Koadic will change according to the ANEL version used in the attack.
The table below lists examples of the commands and outputs for ANEL versions 5.1.1 rc and 5.1.2
rc1. Note that if ANEL 5.1.2 rc1 was downloaded, the attacker would use HTTPS to avoid the
downloaded data being captured as clear text.

Figure 8. Command added when the Koadic RAT is downloaded (use of {Variable}.shell.exec
command)
If Koadic finds that the system is conducive to the attacker’s interests, it downloads a base64encrypted version of the ANEL malware from the Command-and-Control (C&C) server and
executes it. Encrypted ANEL is decrypted using the “certutil -docode” command. When ANEL
executes, a decrypted DLL file with the filename “lena_http_dll.dll” is expanded in memory. This file
contains one export function — either “crt_main” or “lena_main”

Figure 9. Base64 encoded ANEL downloaded by Koadic
ANEL will send the infected environment’s information to the C&C server. When sending the
information, ANEL encrypts the data using blowfish, XOR, and Base64-based encryption methods.
The format ANEL uses to send data is similar to ChChes, but ANEL’s encryption method is easier
to use.

Figure 10. Encryption key using blowfish

We initially discovered the malware known as ANEL back in November 2017. At that time,
ChessMaster was using ANEL as a backdoor into the target system then injects code into
svchost.exe, which then decrypts and activates the embedded backdoor. This initial version of
ANEL had a hardcoded version labeled “5.0.0 beta1” that contained incomplete code. We noted
that this might signify the release of a future variant.
Instead of just one new variant, we discovered four different versions of ANEL:
5.0.0 beta1
5.1.1 rc
5.1.2 rc1
5.2.0 rev1
The different versions contain changes in the ANEL loader and the main ANEL DLL. The figure
below shows a summary of the changes between each version:

The differences shown in the table above are subtle but present. For example, the initial ANEL
version, “5.0.0 beta1,” uses a different C&C server compared to the other versions. Once ANEL
evolved to “5.1.1 rc,” it changed its file type to an executable, while also changing the C&C server.
The third version we found (5.1.2 rc1) reverts to a DLL file type but retains the C&C server. The
fourth version of ANEL (5.2.0 rev1) changes both the export function in the expanded main ANEL
DLL and uses a different C&C server. Overall, we can see subtle changes, which indicate that the
threat actors behind ANEL are making incremental improvements to the malware to refine it.

ANEL 5.2.0 rev1 (right)
Once ANEL enters the user’s system, it will download various tools that could be used for malicious
purposes, including password retrieval tools as well as malicious mail services and accessibility
tools that will allow it to gather information about the system. These include Getpass.exe and
Mail.exe, which are password and information stealers.
It also downloads the following:
Accevent.exe <-> Microsoft Accessible Event Watcher 7.2.0.0
event.dll <-> the loader of ssssss.ddd, (Detected as TROJ_ANELLDR)
Convert webpages to pdf online w ith PDFmyURL

ssssss.ddd (lena_http.bin) <-> encrypted BKDR_ANEL (Detected as BKDR_ANELENC)
These three files work together using a common technique call DLL Side-Loading or DLL
Hijacking. In this scenario, accevent.exe is the primary executable, which is usually legitimate.
After the execution of accevent.exe, it loads event.dll, which will be placed in the same folder (so it
takes loading priority), after which event.dll decrypts and loads the encrypted backdoor
ssssss.ddd, which is BKDR_ANEL. When we analyzed ANEL 5.1.1 rc, encrypted ANEL 5.1.2 rc1
was downloaded and executed.
Short-term mitigation
When the user opens the document DDEAUTO or Link Auto Update, Office will display a message.
If the user clicks on the “No” button, malicious activity will not initiate.

Medium- to long-term mitigation
At first glance, it seems ChessMaster’s evolution over the past few months involves subtle
changes. However, the constant addition and changing of features and attack vectors indicate that
the attackers behind the campaign are unlikely to stop and are constantly looking to evolve their
tools and tactics.
Organizations can implement various techniques and best practices to defend against targeted
attacks, such as regular patching to prevent vulnerability exploitation and using tools that provide
protection across different network levels. Solutions that feature behavior monitoring, application
control, email gateway monitoring, and intrusion/detection systems can help with this.
Given how cybercriminal tools, tactics and procedures are evolving, organizations will have to go
beyond their typical day-to-day security requirements and find a way to preempt attacks. Thus,
there is a pressing need to detect and address threats via a proactive incident response strategy.
Convert webpages to pdf online w ith PDFmyURL

Essentially, this involves creating a remediation plan for effectively combating the threat and using
round-the-clock intrusion detection and threat analysis to prevent attacks from entering the
system. A proactive strategy can be much more effective for targeted attacks, as these kinds of
attacks are often designed to be elusive and difficult to detect, thus the need to scope them out. A
comprehensive security strategy that involves proactive incident response will need the input of
both decision makers and tech-savvy personnel, as they will need to be on the same page for it to
be effective.
In addition to implementing both mitigation techniques and proactive strategies, organizations can
also strengthen their security by employing solutions such Trend Micro™ Deep
Security™, Vulnerability Protection, and TippingPoint, which protects endpoints from threats that
abuse vulnerabilities.
In addition, comprehensive security solutions can be used to protect organizations from attacks.
These include Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites
and Worry-Free™ Business Security, which can protect users and businesses from these threats
by detecting malicious files, well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Trend Micro Deep
Discovery™ can protect enterprises by detecting malicious attachment and URLs.
Trend Micro OfficeScan™ with XGen™ endpoint security infuses high-fidelity machine learning
with other detection technologies and global threat intelligence for comprehensive protection
against all kinds of threats.
