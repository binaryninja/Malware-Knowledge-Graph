A new module for the TrickBot trojan has been discovered that targets the Active Directory
database stored on compromised Windows domain controllers.
TrickBot is typically download and installed on a computer through other malware. This
most common malware that installs TrickBot is Emotet, which is distributed through spam
with malicious Word document attachments.
Once TrickBot is installed, it will harvest various information from a compromised computer
and will then attempt to spread laterally throughout a network to gather more data.
To perform this behavior, TrickBot will download various modules that perform specific
behavior such as stealing cookies, browser information, OpenSSH keys, and spreading to
other computers.
As part of the malware's continued evolution, a new TrickBot module called 'ADll' was
discovered by security researcher Sandor Nemes that executes a variety of Windows
commands that allows the trojan to steal a Windows Active Directory database.

Dumping the Active Directory
1/8

Before we get to how TrickBot steals an Active Directory database to harvest login
credentials, we first need to give a bit of background about a special file called ntds.dit.
When a server is promoted as a domain controller, the Active Directory database will be
created and saved to the default C:\Windows\NTDS folder on the DC.
Inside this folder is a file called ntds.dit, which is a database that contains all Active
Directory services information such as users, passwords, groups, computers, etc.
As this information is sensitive, Windows encrypts the data using a BootKey stored in the
System hive of the Registry. As the ntds.dit is always opened by the domain controller, it
also not possible to access it normally using standard file operations.
To be able to work with the ntds.dit database while it is open, Windows domain controllers
have a tool called ntdsutil that allows administrators to perform database maintenance.

ndtsutil command
Using ntdsutil, administrators can perform the "ifm" (Install from Media) command to create
a dump of the Active Directory. This command is meant to be used to create installation
media that can quickly set up new Domain controllers without having to wait for the Active
Directory to replicate.
If TrickBot is able to gain administrative access to a domain controller, it will abuse this
command to create a copy of the domain's Active Directory database and steal it.

TrickBot steals the Active Directory

TrickBot's new ADll module takes advantage of the "Install from Media" command to dump
the Active Directory database and various Registry hives to the %Temp% folder. These files
are then compressed and sent back to the attackers.
In a conversation with BleepingComputer, Nemes explained that the ADll module will
generate an 8 character ID based on the TrickBot client ID.
The module will then use this ID as the filename argument for the following executed
commands:
ntdsutil "ac in ntds" "ifm" "cr fu %TEMP%\[generated-id]0.dat" q q
reg save HKLM\SAM %TEMP%\[generated-id]1.dat /y
reg save HKLM\SECURITY %TEMP%\[generated-id]2.dat /y
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM %TEMP%\[generated-id]3.dat /y

When executed, the commands will dump the Active Directory database as well as the
SAM, Security, and SYSTEM hives.
When done, Nemes says the module will check if the files exist, compress them, and then
exfiltrate the files back to the attacker's servers.
Now that the attackers have access to these files, they can decrypt the Active Directory
database and dump the usernames, password hashes, computer names, groups, and other
data.
This data can then be used to further spread laterally throughout the network and is
especially helpful for the actors behind the Ryuk Ransomware, which is typically the final
payload for TrickBot infections.

Illustrating how this data helps attackers
To illustrate how the TrickBot module works and what data it can gather using,
BleepingComputer set up a small Windows domain.
Once set up, we execute the first command of " ntdsutil "ac in ntds" "ifm" "cr fu
%TEMP%\H00i0Z000.dat" q q ", which dumps the Active Directory database to the
%TEMP%\H00i0Z000.dat folder.

Dumping the Active Directory database
We also executed the module's reg commands to save the SAM, Security, and SYSTEM
hives to files.
reg save HKLM\SAM %TEMP%\H00i0Z001.dat /y
reg save HKLM\SECURITY %TEMP%\H00i0Z002.dat /y
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM %TEMP%\H00i0Z003.dat /y

When done, our %Temp% folder contained a folder containing the Active Directory
database and three dat files that are the saved Registry hives.

Saved data in %Temp% folder
Inside the H00i0Z001.dat folder is the dumped ntds.dit database file.

The dumped Active Directory database
Using the DSInternals PowerShell modules we can easily extract the BootKey decryption
key from the System hive using the " Get-Bootkey -SystemHivePath
'.\H00i0Z003.dat '" command.

Extracting BootKey from SYSTEM hive
Finally, we execute the DSInternals command " Get-ADDBAccount -All -DBPath
'C:\Users\sanje\Desktop\NTDS\ntds.dit' -Bootkey [key] " to decrypt the database
and view all of the accounts, including their NTML password hashes, as seen below.

Dumping user password hashes from the ntds.dit file
Attackers can then take these hashes and run them through cracking programs to
determine the actual plain-text passwords for these users.
These account credentials can then be used by the attackers to compromise other devices
on the network.

Further information
Active Directory exploitation is a serious subject and is important for domain administrators
to become familiarized with it.
I recommend the "Att&ckingActive Directory for fun and profit" by Huy Kha to learn about
different ways that attackers can access data stored in the Active Directory.
Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez also has a very informative video on how Trickbot and
Ryuk exploit Active Directory services for their benefit.

Is Ntdsutil.exe used for any other function than special circumstances by Admins?
Would a mitigation for this threat be as simple as renaming that file to something else,
or would that break something?
