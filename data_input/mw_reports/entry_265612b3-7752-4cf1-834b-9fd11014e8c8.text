On October 15, 2020, the European Union imposed sanctions on six senior Russian officials
and a leading Russian research institute over the alleged use of a nerve agent from the
Novichok family in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Russia dismissed as
baseless the EU’s allegations that it had not complied with its obligations, under the
convention it ratified in 1997, to discontinue its chemical weapons program. Russian officials
said the country had nothing to do with Navalny’s poisoning and implied that if any party had
used nerve agents on him, it would have been Western secret services. Vladimir Putin, who
in 2017 had personally watched over the destruction of the last remaining Russian chemical
weapons stash, ridiculed the findings of four separate laboratories, confirmed by the OPCW,
that a Novichok-type organophosphate poison was identified in Alexey Navalny’s blood.
Two years earlier, in 2018, Russia had dismissed as unfounded allegations that its military
intelligence had used Novichok to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his
daughter. Similarly, Russia had then stated that it had no ongoing chemical weapons
program and had destroyed all of its prior arsenals; while alluding that UK agencies may
have used their own stash of Novichok to poison the Skripals in a false-flag operation.
A year-long investigation by Bellingcat and its investigative partners The Insider and Der
Spiegel, with contributing investigations from RFE/RL, has discovered evidence that Russia
continued its Novichok development program long beyond the officially announced closure
date. Data shows that military scientists, who were involved with the original chemical
weapons program while it was still run by the Ministry of Defense, were dispersed into
several research entities which continued collaborating among one another in a clandestine,
distributed R&D program. While some of these institutes were integrated with the Ministry of
Defense – but camouflaged their work as research into antidotes to organophosphate
poisoning – other researchers moved to civilian research institutes but may have continued
working, under cover of civilian research, on the continued program.
Our investigative team believes the St. Petersburg State Institute for Experimental Military
Medicine of the Ministry of Defense (“GNII VM”), likely with the assistance of researchers
from the Scientific Center Signal (“SC Signal”), has since 2010 taken the lead role in the
continued R&D and weaponization of the Soviet-era Novichok program.
Crucially for our conclusions, we have identified evidence showing close coordination
between these two institutes and a secretive sub-unit of Military Unit 29155 of Russia’s
military intelligence, the GRU. This unit has previously been linked to the poisoning attempts
1/9

on Emilian Gebrev in Bulgaria in 2015 as well as Sergey and Yula Skripal in the United
Kingdom in 2018. Telecoms data we obtained shows that the St. Petersurg-based institute
communicated intensively with members of the assassination team during the planning stage
of the Skripal mission, while also communicating – at highly correlated moments – with
scientists from SC Signal.
The two research institutes also appear to collaborate with the 33rd Central Experimental
Institute for Scientific Research of the Ministry of Defense, located in the town of Shikhany.
This agency was originally involved in researching and testing the Russian chemical
weapons program.
Furthermore, our research has established that these two institutes were in frequent
communication – including during the planning state of the Skripal operation – with Russia’s
Scientific Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology (“GosNIIOHT”), the agency that
was tasked with supervising the destruction of Russia’s arsenal of nerve agents and
ensuring the termination of the country’s CW program.
The role of the 33rd Central Institute and the GosNIIOHT in the development of Russia’s
nerve agent program was previously known, and the these two institutes were sanctioned by
the European Union. However Neither GNII VM nor SC Signal have been sanctioned by
European or US governments, and it appears that their work has stayed outside of the focus
of Western intelligence services.

GNII VM, the Ministry of Defense’s Institute for Experimental Medicine, is a secretive military
research unit located just outside St. Petersburg. There is scant public information about this
establishment’s structure, personnel and projects. A succinct listing of the institute’s history
and functions on the Defense Ministry’s website suggests that prior to 2015 it had existed as
an adjunct research center within Russia’s Kirov Military Medical Academy, and had been
focused on researching “the ergonomic properties of Russian armaments.” As of May 2015,
however, the institute was given autonomy and a new focus, including “organization of
scientific research in the interest of Russia’s defense and national security” and “conducting
tests of the developed products.” An internal 2017 presentation of the institute, obtained by
our team, shows that – at least officially – its main functions were developing and testing
emergency medical equipment, medication, and treatment techniques for wartime use. In
particular, the institute reported it was developing an antidote to organophosphate poisoning,
with its development being – in 2017 – in a “pre-clinical trial stage”. A rare public lecture
announcement from 2018 shows that leading researchers from the institute were specializing
on the effects of organophosphate poisons on the human body – and were tracking the
international development of antidotes to those. (Poisons from the Novichok group fall into
the larger group of organophosphates – which includes also certain pesticides).

3/9

The St. Petersburg institute is headed by Sergey Chepur, a 50-year old military doctor and
expert in extreme toxicology, with a special interest in the effects of organophosphate
poisons on the human body. There are no open-source photographs of its director Sergey
Chepur, and a rare public mention of his name is contained in a September 2020
announcement of an achievement award for his contribution to military medicine.

Sergey Chepur and Unit 29155’s
As a research entity serving the Ministry of Defense, the St. Petersburg’s institute has a
legitimate and plausible interest in developing antidotes for nerve agents including
organophosphates. However, telecoms data we obtained shows that key researchers from
the institute are integrated with Russia’s military intelligence, including its black-operations
unit (a clandestine sub-unit of GRU’s Unit 29155) to a degree that cannot be explained away
by purely defensive considerations. After initially stumbling upon the phone number of the
institute’s chairman, Sergey Chepur, in phone call records of Unit 29155’s commander Maj.
General Andrey Averyanov, the same number kept popping up in phone records of other
members of the black-ops team, including the main suspects in the poisonings in Bulgaria
and the UK. This prompted us to obtain Chepur’s own phone records. They showed that he
had repeated communication with at least four members of the clandestine team, and that
the communications peaked just before undercover international operations undertaken by

4/9

the GRU officers. Furthemore, the phone records contained metadata showing that Sergey
Chepur visited the headquarters of the GRU during what appeared to be preparation
meetings on the eve of the 2018 Salisbury operation.
In the period from November 2017 until early March 2018 – when the Skripal poisoning
operation would have been planned by the GRU – Chepur spoke repeatedly with members
of Unit 29155. He spoke or texted with the unit’s commander, Andrey Averyanov, at least 65
times (the data about these interactions were purged from Averyanov’s phone records but
remained visible in Chepur’s phone metadata). In this period he also communicated
repeatedly with Maj. Gen. Denis Sergeev, also known under his cover identity of “Sergey
Fedotov”, who supervised both the Gebrev poisoning operation in 2015 and the 2018 Skripal
poisoning. Chepur also spoke and texted many times with Alexander Mishkin (a.k.a.
“Alexander Petrov”), one of the two suspects wanted by UK law enforcement over the Skripal
poisonings, as well as with Col. Alexander Kovalchuk. Both Kovalchuk and Mishkin are part
of the clandestine-operations GRU team and are medical doctors who graduated from the
Kirov medical military academy in St. Petersburg. Alexander Kovalchuk did not travel to the
United Kingdom during the Salisbury mission, but remained at the GRU headquarters during
the three days of the operation which extended into the weekend.
Phone records for 2017 and 2018 show that Sergey Chepur contacted Alexander Mishkin for
the first time three months before the Skripal poisoning, on the December 30, 2017. The very
next day, Mishkin, traveling under the false identity of “Alexander Petrov,” took a flight from
Russia to Switzerland, his travel data shows. On the day Mishkin left for Geneva, Col.
Anatoly Chepiga – a.k.a “Ruslan Boshirov,” the second suspect in the Skripal poisonings –
arrived back from Geneva to Moscow. During the period from Christmas 2017 until the end of
February 2018, at least five members of unit 29155 traveled to Switzerland on a staggered
schedule, usually with at least two undercover officers being in the country at any given time.
The last member of the team departed from Geneva to Moscow on March 1, 2018, the same
day on which Sergeeev, Mishkin and Chepiga bought tickets for their flight to London the
next day.
Bellingcat has previously reported on the relevance of Switzerland as a frequently visited
location by unit 29155 and has hypothesized that the Skripal attack may have been prepared
there, or that alternatively the GRU may have expected Sergei Skripal to travel to
Switzerland during the holiday period. The calls between Chepur and Mishkin in the
immediate run-up to the “New Year trips” corroborate our earlier hypothesis. It is unlikely that
the relatively small GRU elite team would have had the capacity to work on two separate
operations in such a small stretch of time.

Immediately following Mishkin’s return from Switzerland on January 12, 2018, Sergey
Chepur had several calls with Mishkin and his boss Andrey Averyanov, on January 13, 14,
17 and 18. A month before the Salisbury operation, on February 2 and 3, 2018, Chepur was
contacted for the first time by Denis Sergeev. Serveev, as we previously reported, oversaw
the poisoning mission from a London hotel room, where he kept continuous communication
with a burner phone number in Russia. On the evening of February 12, 2018, in the course
of 17 minutes (from 20:59 to 21:16), Chepur contacted three GRU officers from the
clandestine unit – Mishkin, Sergeev and Kovalchuk.
On 18 January, Chepur took a one-day trip to Moscow and spent the day at the GRU
headquarters. Metadata from Mishkin, Sergeev and Kovalchuk’s phone show they were at
the same location at the same time. The previous day Denis Sergeev had returned from
Geneva where he had spent a week.
Chepur also had a vast number of interactions with the GRU team on the February 23, 2018.
In Russia, this date is celebrated as Defender of the Fatherland day and it is customary for
the military to send celebratory messages to each other. However, Chepur’s communication
with the GRU team members stand out from the rest as they extend late into the evening,
ending with a midnight (23:59) conversation with Alexander Kovalchuk. The number of
interactions and the late-night exchanges suggest they were likely linked to the planning of
the Skripal operation which was to take place just a week later.
Crucially, on February 27, 2018, just three days before the GRU trio departed for London,
Chepur flew to Moscow on a one-day trip. Upon arrival in Moscow, he communicated with
several GRU officers as well as with members of another research institute, SC Signal.

Afterwards, he headed for the headquarters of the GRU where he spent several hours.
Sergeev, Mishkin and Kovalchuk were also present at the GRU headquarters at the same
time.
Following his three hour stay there, Chepur made two further phone calls to a key researcher
from SC Signal. Chepur then moved to the territory of 27th Military Scientific Center at
Baumanskaya St. During this visit, which lasted just over an hour, he had several further
calls with one of SC Signal’s lead scientists and organophosphates specialists, Victor
Taranchenko.
Our hypothesis is that during this day – February 27, 2018 – final preparations for the
upcoming assassination mission in Salisbury were made in Moscow, including for the
delivery of the poison and the tools for its applicators, to the GRU black-ops unit.

SC Signal: From Novichok to Sports Drinks
A key part of Russia’s official chemical weapons program prior to its termination was
conducted by the 33rd Central Scientific-Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense. This
institute, based in the formerly closed military town Shikhany-2 near Saratov, was the R&D
base for development of a particularly powerful strand of organophosphate nerve agents
commonly referred to as “Novichoks.” Another military institute that had an ancillary role in
the development and testing of nerve agents was the 27th Scientific Center (which was
briefly incorporated into the 33rd Center); this institute oversees one of the two Russian
chemical-analytical labs accredited by the OPCW.
In analyzing Sergey Chepur’s call metadata, we identified a correlation between his calls and
visits with GRU’s unit 29155, and calls with several researchers who had formerly worked for
the 27th Scientific Center. These included the former chairman of the center – Artur Zhirov,
as well as his former colleagues Andrey Antokhin and Victor Taranchenko. Chepur spoke
with Artur Jirov on 11, 18 and 30 January 2018, on one of the days – the 18 – not long after a
phone call to Alexander Mishkin. However, the most notable correlation is with Chepur’s
communication with Viktor Taranchenko. Taranchenko was the first person Chepur called
once he landed in Moscow on February 27 and just before he headed to the GRU
headquarters. Once he was at the GRU and presumably during the planning meeting for the
upcoming Salisbury operation, the two exchanged several text messages.
While still working at the 27th Scientific Center, Taranchenko and his colleague Antokhin had
specialized in research of cholinesterase inhibitors, a broad class to which the Novichok and
other powerful nerve agents belong. Artur Zhirov, on the other hand, had specialized in
research of nano-encapsulation: an innovative technique permitting the embedding of
chemical compounds into a cell-like membrane-covered structure made of other compounds.
This technique appeared to be a promising solution to the necessity to delay the onset of the
effects of certain pharmaceuticals.

7/9

Taranchenko, like Antokhin and several other key researchers from the 27th Scientific
Center, had followed their former boss in 2010 when he left the Center to become the
founding CEO of a new scientific research center created through a presidential decree, the
generically named Scientific Center “Signal.” SC Signal is incorporated into the structure of
Russia’s Export Control Agency, and its official function is to ensure technical and scientific
control over the exports of Russian materials, including “chemicals and technologies that can
be used in the manufacturing of chemical weapons”
SC Signal and the St. Petersburg experimental-medicine institute work on two publicly
known projects, which in theory could explain the interaction between Sergey Chepur and
the Signal researchers. However, the correlation between the calls with SC Signal and
members of Unit 29155, as well as a visit by Chepur to one of the addresses of SC Signal on
January 31, 2018, following which he continued to the GRU headquarters, suggest that the
contacts between Chepur and the SC Signal are likely linked to the planning of the Salisbury
operation.

One of the labs of SC Signal is located at Natatinskaya 16 in Moscow. The same address houses one of
Russia’s military institutes tasked with the destruction of Russia”s chemical weapons arsenal.

According to several experts contacted by our team, the technique of nano-encapsulation –
which appears to be the area of specialization of many of the researchers working at SC
Signal – may be successfully applied in the application of organophosphate nerve agents
such as the Novichoks. Through this method, experts say, three effects might be achieved
8/9

that would improve the efficiency and ease of application of the poison. First, nanoencapsulation could delay the onset of the poison by several hours, which may be desirable
in clandestine operations. Second, it can improve the rate and speed of absorption through
the target’s skin. Third, it can provide an opportunity for masking the presence of the active
ingredients of Novichok, through the (overwhelming) presence in the victim’s body of
chemical compounds from the cell’s “membrane” – which can be a different, decoy
poisonous substance. Notably, both in the cases of the poisoning of Emilian Gebrev in 2015,
and in the case of Navalny, presence of other, non-Novichok – and much less dangerous
poisons – in the targets’ blood were reported.
When approached by our team to comment on the possible link between the SC Signal and
the Ministry of Defense’s continued program for development of Novichok, the institute’s
chairman Artur Zhirov hung up the telephone after hearing the question and without uttering
a word. Reached by telephone and asked about his possible involvement in the development
of organophosphate poisons, Mr. Taranchenko denied and said he was not even an expert in
organophosphates – which appears to be contradicted by his body of published research.
Confronted by phone about his frequent interactions with members of GRU’s Unit 29155, Mr.
Sergey Chepur said he had never spoken to any of Alexander Mishkin, Denis Sergeev, or
Andrey Averyanov. He also appeared to clearly remember that he did not visit the GRU
headquarters on February 27, 2018. Before hanging up, he advised us to “stop lying to
everyone including to yourselves”.
