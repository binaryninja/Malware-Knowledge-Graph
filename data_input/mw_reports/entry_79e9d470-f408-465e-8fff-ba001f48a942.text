PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South
and Southeast Asia
Microsoft proactively monitors the threat landscape for emerging threats. Part of this job involves
keeping tabs on targeted activity groups, which are often the first ones to introduce new exploits and
techniques that are later used widely by other attackers. In the previous volume, “STRONTIUM: A
profile of a persistent and motivated adversary,” on page 3 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report,
Volume 19 (January–June 2015), chronicled the activities of one such group, which had attracted
interest because of its aggressive, persistent tactics and techniques as well as its repeated use of new
zero-day exploits to attack its targets.
This section describes the history, behavior, and tactics of a newly discovered targeted activity group,
which Microsoft has code-named PLATINUM. Microsoft is sharing some of the information it has
gathered on this group in the hope that it will raise awareness of the group’s activities and help
organizations take immediate advantage of available mitigations that can significantly reduce the risks
they face from this and similar groups.
Adversary profile
PLATINUM has been targeting its victims since at least as early as 2009, and may have been active for
several years prior. Its activities are distinctly different not only from those typically seen in untargeted
attacks, but from many targeted attacks as well. A large share of targeted attacks can be characterized
as opportunistic: the activity group changes its target profiles and attack geographies based on
geopolitical seasons, and may attack institutions all over the world. Like many such groups, PLATINUM
seeks to steal sensitive intellectual property related to government interests, but its range of preferred
targets is consistently limited to specific governmental organizations, defense institutes, intelligence
agencies, diplomatic institutions, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast Asia. The
group’s persistent use of spear phishing tactics (phishing attempts aimed at specific individuals) and
access to previously undiscovered zero-day exploits have made it a highly resilient threat.
After researching PLATINUM, Microsoft has identified the following key characteristics of the group and
its activities:
•

PLATINUM has conducted several cyber espionage campaigns since at least 2009.

•

PLATINUM focuses on a small number of campaigns per year, which reduces the risk of detection
and helps the group stay unnoticed and focused for a longer period of time.

•

PLATINUM has focused on targets associated with governments and related organizations in South
and Southeast Asia.

PLATINUM has
been targeting its
victims since at
least as early as
2009.

•
PLATINUM has used multiple unpatched vulnerabilities in zeroday exploits against its victims.
•
Spear phishing is the group’s main method of infecting
targeted users’ computers.

•
PLATINUM makes a concerted effort to hide their infection
tracks, by self-deleting malicious components, or by using server
side logic in ‘one shot mode’ where remotely hosted malicious components are only allowed to
load once
•

PLATINUM often spear phishes its targets at their non-official or private email accounts, to use as a
stepping stone into the intended organization’s network.

•

PLATINUM uses custom-developed malicious tools and has the resources to update these
applications often to avoid being detected.

•

PLATINUM configures its backdoor malware to restrict its activities to victims’ working hours, in an
attempt to disguise post-infection network activity within normal user traffic.

•

PLATINUM does not conduct its espionage activity to engage in direct financial gain, but instead
uses stolen information for indirect economic advantages.

•

In some cases, the combination of these mechanisms—use of undisclosed zero-day exploits,
custom malware that is not used elsewhere, PLATINUM’s skill in covering its tracks, and others—has
enabled the group to compromise targets for several years without being detected.

Targeted activity groups are skilled at covering their tracks and evading detection, and it can be very
difficult to definitively associate an activity group with a specific nation-state or group of individuals.
Attackers could be patriotic groups, opportunistic cyber units, state-sponsored hackers, or intelligence
agents. Although PLATINUM could belong to any one of the aforementioned categories, the group
shows traits of being well funded, organized, and focused on information that would be of most use to
government bodies.

PLATINUM primarily targets its intended victims using spear phishing. There is also some data
indicating the group’s usage of drive-by attacks against vulnerable browser-plugins. Although the
group’s methods for performing reconnaissance to determine who to pursue remains unknown, the
number of victims targeted at each affected institution is consistently very small. In some cases, the
victims were targeted at their non-official email addresses, demonstrating that the scope of
PLATINUM’s research capabilities is fairly extensive. For the initial infection, PLATINUM typically sends
malicious documents that contain exploits for vulnerabilities in various software programs, with links or
remotely loaded components (images or scripts or templates) that are delivered to targets only once.
The group has made concerted efforts towards designing their initial spear-phishes in a manner where
the final payload is only delivered to the intended victim. The group is known to have used a number of
zero-day exploits, for which no security update is available at the time of transmission, in these
attempts. (All have subsequently been addressed by security updates from the affected vendors.)

Lure documents are typically given topical names that may be of interest to the recipient. Such lures
often address controversial subjects or offer provocative opinions, in an effort to incite the reader into
opening them. Figure 3 shows a sample of such titles.

These documents were sent to intended victims in Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Malaysia, and the
filenames contain references to cities, politicians, and current events in those locations. The oldest
confirmed PLATINUM exploit was named “The corruption of Mahathir,” a document that was
transmitted in 2009 referencing the former prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad.
Figure 4. The oldest confirmed lure document sent by PLATINUM, in 2009

PLATINUM’s recent activities remain focused on tactics such as these. In February 2016, PLATINUM was
observed using a legitimate website dedicated to news about the Indian government, as an infection
vector. This site, which is not associated with the Indian government itself, also provides a free email
service for its users, giving them email addresses with the site’s own domain name. PLATINUM sent
spear phishing messages to users of the service, which included some Indian government officials. After

infecting an unsuspecting user this way, the attackers had complete control of the user’s computer and
used it as a stepping stone into the official network to which the user belonged.
Figure 5. PLATINUM used a private webmail service to infect a government network

PLATINUM’s approach toward exploiting vulnerabilities varies between campaigns. In one case from
2013, the target was sent a malicious document through a spear phishing email message. 1 The
document, when opened, used an embedded ActiveX control to download a JavaScript file from a
remote site that used a previously unknown vulnerability in some versions of Windows (later designated
CVE-2013-7331) to read information about the browser’s installed components. 2

Figure 7. Malicious JavaScript used by PLATINUM to perform fingerprinting on a victim’s browser

While fingerprinting the versions of the browser plugins, the script loads a remotely hosted malicious
PNG file that exploited another previously unknown vulnerability (designated CVE-2013-1331), which
affected Microsoft Office 2003 SP3. 3 Exploiting the vulnerability resulted in memory corruption, which
allowed the attacker to execute remote code on the computer.

Also a combination of lure documents with the aforementioned embedded ActiveX control was seen
along with a Dipsind executable named as ‘pp4x322.dll’ during a different attack. The unique name of
this executable indicated a possible DLL side-loading vulnerability also being used by PLATINUM
against Powerpoint 2007.

targeted by the spear phish document.

When the document was opened in Word, it exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in the
Microsoft Office PostScript interpreter (designated CVE-2015-2545) that enabled it to execute the
attacker’s code and drop an attacker-generated malicious DLL onto the computer. 5 The DLL exploited
another previously unknown vulnerability (designated CVE-2015-2546) in the Windows kernel, which
enabled it to elevate privileges for the Word executable and subsequently install a backdoor through
the application. 6 Researching this attack and the malware used therein led Microsoft to discover other
instances of PLATINUM attacking users in India around August 2015.

case due to built-in mitigations.

In total, PLATINUM made use of four zero-day exploits during these two attack campaigns (two remote
code execution bugs, one privilege escalation, and one information disclosure), showing an ability to
spend a non-trivial amount of resources to either acquire professionally written zero-day exploits from
unknown markets, or research and utilize the zero-day exploits themselves. In both
these campaigns the activity group included remote triggers to deactivate
PLATINUM used
exploitation, with an attempt to conceal the vulnerability, and prevent analysis of the
four zero-day exattack. The resources required to research and deploy multiple zero-day exploits
ploits during these
within the same attack campaign are considerable. Such activity requires a
significant amount of investment in research and development, along with the
two campaigns.
discipline to ensure that the exploits are not used until the appropriate time, and
that no one involved with the project leaks them to other parties.
Technical details
After gaining access to a victim’s computer, PLATINUM installs its own custom-built malware to
communicate with the compromised system, issue commands, and move laterally through the
network. The wide collection of backdoors and tools, and the differences between them, suggest the
involvement of multiple teams or vendors in the development process. This section describes some of
the tools used by the group.
Dipsind
PLATINUM uses a number of different custom-developed backdoors to communicate with infected
computers. The lack of any significant evidence of shared code between any of these backdoor families
is another clue as to the scope of the resources on which the activity group is able to draw, and the
precautions the group is willing and able to take in order to avoid losing its ability to conduct its
espionage operations.
The group’s most frequently used backdoors belong to a malware family that Microsoft has designated
Dipsind, although some variants are detected under different names. Multiple Dipsind variants have
been identified, all of which are believed to be used exclusively by PLATINUM.
The first variant, Win32/Dipsind.A!dha, is a lightweight application providing backdoor access to
remote attackers. It can be customized for every victim to ensure that it remains undetected in targeted
networks. It supports a small set of instructions that allow the attacker to perform basic functions, such
as uploading or downloading files and spawning remote shells.

Figure 11. Sample configuration file for Win32/Dipsind.A

Each Dipsind file contains an embedded encrypted configuration file that acts as a control for the
backdoor. This configuration file also includes the initial command and control (C&C) location the
Dipsind backdoor uses in addition to the pollcommandsite variable which references a URL where
additional backup C&Cs can be polled. Configurable parameters include instructions on where Dipsind
should install a copy of cmd.exe for spawning a remote shell, depending on the user’s privileges, the
hours during which the backdoor should function, and exfiltrate information. This capability allows the
backdoor to confine its activities to normal working hours, making its communications harder to
distinguish from normal network traffic.
Dipsind has been observed using a combination of IP addresses and domains for its C&C infrastructure.
The domains are a mix of registered domains and free subdomains obtained through dynamic DNS
providers. Collected data showed that a vast majority of victim networks allowed unfiltered access to
the dynamic DNS hosts. The hosts and domains are hosted on compromised infrastructure based in
several different countries, some within academic institutions. In some cases, the backdoors are
configured to connect to IP addresses instead of domain names. These factors make it challenging to
locate the activity group’s infrastructure.
Figure 12 shows a sampling of C&C infrastructure used by PLATINUM between 2009 and 2015.

After Dipsind.A is installed on the victim’s computer, it connects to its C&C server for authentication. All
network traffic is over HTTP, base64 encoded, with the underlying data encrypted using AES256 in ECB
mode. Authentication is a five-step process, as shown in the following figure:
Figure 13. Win32/Dipsind.A initial communication protocol (as decrypted)

Analysis of several samples of this variant show exactly the same AES key
(AOPSH03SK09POKSID7FF674PSLI91965) in use since 2009. The initial HTTP POST made by this
backdoor appears as “ud7LDjtsTHe2tWeC8DYo8A**”, which translates to a simple whitespace. This
sequence makes a simple network indicator usable by defenders.

A second Dipsind variant registers as a Winlogon Event Notify DLL. This backdoor contains a minimized
feature list from the original Dipsind variant, and supports a more limited number of commands.
It sets the following registry keys in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive for persistence and functionality:
•

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\Cscdll32\Asynchronous

•

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\Cscdll32\DllName

•

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\Cscdll32\Impersonate

•

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\Cscdll32\Startup

•

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\Cscdll32\shutdown

•

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\cscdll32

There are at least two additional minor versions of this variant, each of which show improvements in
command implementation.
One interesting feature of this variant is the way it implements a mechanism similar to port knocking to
allow remote attackers to connect to a compromised computer without leaving any connection open
for too long. The sequence of events is as follows:
1.

The backdoor is installed via an exploit.

2. The backdoor sets a registry key to open a specific UDP port through the local firewall, if any, and
listens to the port for incoming traffic.
3. At a remote location, the attacker executes a tool (called PK2 here, although the actual name of the
tool is unknown) using the following parameters:
Pk2.exe <IP> <UDP Port> <TCP Port> <Password>
where the IP address is that of the computer with the backdoor, the UDP port is the one specified
by the backdoor, and the password is a string encrypted by the tool before being sent.
4. The backdoor receives the UDP packets, and then checks to see if the password is valid.
5. If the password is indeed valid, the backdoor will wait for exactly 20 seconds and only then open
the PK2 specified TCP port for a window of 3 seconds.

Figure 14. How the Dipsind knocker component communicates with an attacker

PK2 is also designed to connect to such open TCP ports and act as a console client for issuing
commands to the backdoor. When running PK2 as a console client, the attacker needs to re-enter the
password to authenticate a second time against the backdoor, and issue commands such as #sz to
upload a file and #rz to download a file. During this research, one such collection of tools was obtained
that had the password set to “t@ng0p@ss”. All communication used by this backdoor and PK2 is
encrypted. If a connection from PK2 is not received within the 3-second window, the TCP port is shut
and PK2 would need to reinitialize the port-knocking process.
JPIN

In addition to Dipsind and its variants, PLATINUM uses a few other families of custom-built backdoors
within its attack toolset. These families of backdoors are significantly different in their capabilities and
have completely different code bases. While one family relies on a small number of supported
commands and simple shells, the other delves into more convoluted methods of injections, checks, and
supported feature sets.
Microsoft researchers refer to one such set of backdoor variants collectively as “JPIN,” which is the
name of a service it uses when installed. JPIN is a comprehensive tool for executing and extracting
information from the compromised computer. There is strong evidence to suggest that the developers
of the JPIN and Dipsind code bases were in some way related.
JPIN has its own installer and uninstaller component, which deletes itself when it encounters a version
of Windows earlier than Windows XP, or finds any of these security-related processes running:

After installing the backdoor, the installer deletes itself from the compromised computer.
PLATINUM uses at least three distinct JPIN variants. One variant typically runs with a mutex named
“hMSVmm” and installs itself in the folders %appdata%\Comm\Jpin and
%userprofile%\AppData\Resource\Jpin. After it is installed and started, the JPIN service can perform
the following tasks, among others:
•

Obtain information about the computer, such as operating system version, user name, privileges,
disk space, and so on.

•

List running services, processes, job IDs, and task IDs.

•

Enumerate drives and their types.

•

Enumerate registry keys.

•

Load a custom keylogger.

•

Download files.

•

Download and upgrade itself.

•

Acquire network information such as DNS, IP, proxies, and so on.

•

Exfiltrate information over HTTP GET and POST requests, with the data stored either within the
HTTP body or within the URL parameters.

•

Lower security settings by tampering with registry keys.

•

Inject content into the lsass.exe process, in order to load the keylogger module into lsass and call its
exported function.

•

Communicate via FTP.

•

Send email via SMTP.

•

Change permissions on files using the cacls.exe command-line utility.

JPIN can also target mobile suite applications and extract data from them. The backdoor contains code
that looks for installed instances of Symbian, Blackberry, and Windows Phone management
applications. If any are found, the backdoor logs sync dates, IMEI data, phone manufacturer and model
information, software version date, memory, location, and capacity, among other things.

JPIN can target
mobile suite applications and extract
data from them.

The second JPIN variant is very similar to the first one. It downloads
the backdoor payload from remote locations via the BITS service,
using the COM object for BITS. This variant also has its own installer
and uninstaller component, which deletes itself when it encounters a
version of Windows earlier than Windows XP, or finds any of the
processes listed in Figure 15 running.

The third known variant does not check for the processes listed in Figure 15. It uses an installer
component that includes the backdoor as payload disguised as a bitmap within its resource section.
The payload is in an encrypted and compressed form, disguised to avoid any suspicion from security
solutions. This variant has been seen installing itself into the following file system paths:
•

%appdata%\Java\support

•

%appdata%\support

•

%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Java\Support

•

%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Support

adbupd
Another backdoor used by PLATINUM is very similar to the Dipsind family. It is informally referred to
internally at Microsoft as “adbupd”, which is the name of the service under which it is installed. Salient
features of this backdoor include the following:
•

It tries to install itself under several different names within the Program Files directory

•

It has the ability to support plug-ins to modularize functionality

•

It contains a copy of the OpenSSL library to support encryption when sending or receiving data

•

It contains functionality to run a copy of cmd.exe

•

The configuration file is very similar to the original Dipsind family

•

This backdoor class uses multiple methods of achieving persistence, one of which is using WMI
/MOF compiled scripts, such as the one shown in Figure 16.

Keyloggers
The PLATINUM group has written a few different versions of keyloggers that perform their functions in
different ways, most likely to take advantage of different weaknesses in victims’ computing
environments. The keyloggers can be broadly classified into two groups: those that log keystrokes
through raw device input, and user mode keyloggers that use Windows hook interfaces to gather
information. In particular, this second group also has the capability of dumping users’ credentials using
the same technique employed by Mimikatz. Both groups can set permissions on specific files to
Everyone, and work in tandem with the PLATINUM backdoors.

Hot patcher
One of PLATINUM’s most recent and interesting tools is meant to inject code into processes using a
variety of injection techniques. In addition to using several publicly known injection methods to perform
this task, it also takes advantage of an obscure operating system feature known as hot patching.
Hot patching is an operating system-supported feature for installing updates without having to reboot
or restart a process. At a high level, hot patching can transparently apply patches to executables and
DLLs in actively running processes, which does not happen with traditional methods of code injection
such as CreateRemoteThread or WriteProcessMemory. Instead, the kernel is instructed to perform the
injection by invoking NtSetSystemInformation (with an appropriate SystemInformationClass) to apply
the patch. The information about the patch is delivered via a specially crafted DLL that is loaded into
the target process.
The hot patching feature originally shipped with Windows Server 2003 and was used to ship 10 patches
to Windows Server 2003. It was removed in Windows 8 and has not been included in subsequent
releases of Windows. PLATINUM appears to believe that enough of their targeted users continue to run
the earlier versions of Windows to make the technique a useful tool, at least until early 2017 (see page
20).
The technique PLATINUM uses to inject code via hot patching was first documented by security
researchers in 2013. 7 Administrator permissions are required for hot patching, and the technique used
by PLATINUM does not attempt to evade this requirement through exploitation. Rather, the
component’s use of the hot patching feature appears to be a way to avoid being detected, as many
antivirus solutions monitor non-system processes for the regular injection methods such as
CreateRemoteThread. If the tool fails to inject code using hot patching, it reverts to attempting the
other more common code injection techniques into common Windows processes, primarily targeting
winlogon.exe, lsass.exe and svchost.exe:
•

CreateRemoteThread

•

NtQueueApcThread

•

RtlCreateUserThread

•

NtCreateThreadEx

The hot patching component performs the following steps:
1.

It patches the loader with a proper hot patch to treat injected DLLs with execute page permissions.
This step is required for DLLs loaded from memory (in an attempt to further conceal the malicious
code).

Alex Ionescu, “Hotpatching the Hotpatcher: Stealth File-less DLL Injection,” SyScan 2013,
https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/14255220/alexsyscan13/23.

2. The backdoor is injected into svchost using the hot patch API. Patching the loader is done by
creating a section named \knowndlls\mstbl.dll. This DLL does not reside on disk, but is rather
treated as a cached DLL by the session manager. It then proceeds to write a PE file within that
section.
3. The PE file will have one section (.hotp1) with the hot patch header structure. This structure contains
all the information necessary to perform the patching of function ntdll!LdrpMapViewOfSection,
which will cause the loader to treat created sections as PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE instead of
PAGE_READWRITE. The patch is successfully applied by invoking NtSetSystemInformation.
4. After the memory permission issue is solved, the injector proceeds to inject the malicious DLL into
svchost. Again, it creates a (now executable) section named knowndlls\fgrps.dll and invokes
NtSetSystemInformation, which causes the final payload to be loaded and executed within the
target process (svchost).
5. The malicious hot patching component appears to have an expiration date of January 15, 2017.
After that date, the DLL will no longer perform the injection, but rather execute another PLATINUM
implant (C:\Program Files\Windows Journal\Templates\Cpl\jnwmon.exe –ua), which may be
related to an uninstall routine. (The component has not been observed in use since March 9, 2016,
which may indicate that PLATINUM has chosen to stop using it earlier than the configured
expiration date.)
Miscellaneous
Finally, the PLATINUM group also uses small single-purpose applications that duplicate some of the
functionality of the backdoors. A couple of examples are:
•

A stand-alone persistence tool that takes other files as input and ensures persistence across
reboots.

•

A stand-alone loader that runs another executable. It has some exported functions whose names
can be used in DLL files installed as LSA password filters, but such functions are basically empty and
there is no known evidence that this tool was ever used in this way. On the whole, this DLL looks like
a test, suggesting that the attackers may have researched and possibly implemented variants of
their malware that can be installed as LSA password filters.

Exploit (CVE-2015-2545)
CVE-2015-2545 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the embedded PostScript filter of Microsoft Office. 8
The exploit was crafted in PostScript and is able to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
and Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

8

Microsoft issued Security Bulletin MS15-099 in September 2015 to address the issue.

This vulnerability allowed the attacker to forge a CAssoc structure, shown in Figure 17, and so also
indirectly the PSObjs in the structure. The PostScript interpreter deciphers the value field (Val) based on
the type field (m_type), which are under complete control of the attacker. Having developed this
technique, the attacker will craft and use a combination of file, string, and integer objects to gain a
reliable arbitrary code execution.
Figure 17. Memory layout of CSssoc structure and its embedded PSObjs

Root cause:The attacker defined in PostScript a dictionary with three elements, which leads to an
allocation of three CAssoc structures in PSTMap.
Within a Forall loop, the last two elements are undefined and a string is initialized. The PostScript
statement results in a deallocation of the last two CAssoc structures and the string gets allocated in the
previously freed memory address. The PostScript-put operand is used to fill the string with data to
mimic a CAssoc structure. By setting the hash table index to 0x3ff, the loop will exit because the hash
table at that time has a max-size of 0x400. Upon exiting the loop, a reference will be returned to the
secondary element, which is the forged structure.
Figure 18. Reusage of deallocated Memory by a forged CAssoc Structure

Acquire full memory RW access: The described method is used to craft a PSString object in which the
length of the string is set to a maximum value. As a result, the exploit can use PostScript methods to
search for ROP gadgets to dynamically assemble a ROP shellcode.

Figure 19. Getinterval method of PSString is used to find ROP gadgets

The purpose of this approach is to call VirtualProtect to set the pages of the second-stage shellcode as
executable. As a result, DEP and ASLR are bypassed.
Arbitrary code execution: To redirect code execution to the ROP chain, the exploit crafts a PSFile Object
in which the vtable is controlled by the attacker. By calling the bytesavailable method within the
PostScript code, arbitrary code execution is achieved.
Identity
Although the exact identity of PLATINUM remains unknown, the technical indicators observed so far
can help create a profile of the attacker.
•

Usage of multiple backdoors. The different backdoors written by or for the group indicate a
considerable investment over time. Research indicates that PLATINUM has used multiple
backdoors concurrently at times, which could represent either multiple teams within the activity
group performing different campaigns, or different versions of the tools being used against varying
victim networks.

•

Zero day exploits. PLATINUM has used several zero-day exploits against their victims. Regardless of
whether they researched the exploits themselves or purchased them from independent
researchers, the monetary investment required to collect and deploy zero-day exploits at this level
is considerable.

•

Victim geography. More often than not, research into targeted attacks shows
activity groups becoming opportunistic and attacking topical targets; that is,
targets considered valuable based on the geopolitical events of the year.
PLATINUM has consistently targeted victims within a small set of countries in
South and Southeast Asia. In addition, the victims are consistently associated
with a small set of entities that are directly or indirectly connected to
governments.

•

Tools. Some of the tools used by PLATINUM, such as the port-knocking
backdoor, show signs of organized thinking. PLATINUM has developed or
commissioned a number of custom tools to provide the group with access to victim resources. This
behavior exhibits PLATINUM’s ability to adapt to victim networks, which is further evidence of the
group’s considerable resources for development and maintenance.

The monetary investment required
to collect and
deploy zero-day
exploits at this level
is considerable.

Any of these traits by themselves could be the work of a single resourceful attacker or a small
group of like-minded individuals, but the presence of all of them is a clear indication of a wellresourced, focused, and disciplined group of attackers vying for information from governmentrelated entities.
Guidance
PLATINUM is an extremely difficult adversary for targeted organizations to defend against. It possesses
a wide range of technical exploitation capabilities, significant resources for researching or purchasing
complicated zero-day exploits, the ability to sustain persistence across victim networks for years, and
the manpower to develop and maintain a large number of tools to use within unique victim networks.
Their ability to research their victims prior to targeting them, along with the capability to architect
exploits that only work once or for a short period of time, makes it very difficult to investigate or track
their activities. That said, there are steps that organizations can take to reduce the likelihood of
PLATINUM conducting successful attacks against their employees and networks.
•

Take advantage of native mitigations built into Windows 10. Newer versions of Windows include
critical mitigations that render some of PLATINUM’s exploits ineffective when deployed. For
example, the summer 2015 attack that used the unusual ‘resume’ would not have been successful
on Windows 10 as-is because of the presence of the Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP)
mitigation, even without the latest security updates installed. Even if CVE-2015-2546 affected
Windows 10, the exploitation would have required much more technical prowess to succeed;
ultimately, SMEP makes it more difficult for attackers. The hooking and in-memory patching
techniques used by the malicious ‘hot patcher’ component are also not effective against newer
versions of Windows.

•

Apply all security updates as soon as they become available. Microsoft deeply researches each
security issue, proactively addresses the flaw, and mitigates the attack surface around the affected
component(s). For example, one zero-day vulnerability exploit (CVE-2015-2545) used by
PLATINUM was addressed immediately in September 2015. Subsequently, in November, Microsoft
also released a proactive security update for the same component that ended up mitigating other
exploits surfacing in-the-wild after the first attack. Customers who applied the security updates in
November without delay would have been protected against the second wave of exploits. Such
measures of hardening the underlying application happen often. MS09-017 is yet another example,
in which installation of newly available security updates significantly reduced the attack surface.

•

Consider disabling features, such as EPS or macros, in powerful products like Microsoft Office by
using Group Policy. Not all organizations find the need to enable all features. For example, in the
PLATINUM attack campaign that used CVE-2015-2545, a network in which Office EPS was disabled
would not have been affected.

•

Enterprise networks should segregate high business impact (HBI) data-holding segments from
Internet-connected networks. Sharing of removable media between these air-gapped networks

should be strictly enforced. In the case of PLATINUM, such a network architecture would prevent
targeted users from accessing third-party email services and thereby granting attackers access to
sensitive segments of the organizational network.
•

Conduct enterprise software security awareness training, and build awareness of malware
prevention. PLATINUM may have used zero-day flaws to compromise victim computers, but doing
so required action by the user, who either clicked a link in an email or opened an attachment to
allow the attacker to take control of their computer. Security training can raise
awareness and reduce the risk associated with this attack vector.

Apply all security
updates as soon as
they become
available.

•

Institute a strong network firewall and proxy. Many tools used by attackers are
not compatible with network proxies. In the case of PLATINUM’s version of portknocking, the opening of a UDP port would have been rendered moot if a
network firewall was blocking access for inbound packets to the host’s open
port.

•

Enterprise networks should consider blocking certain types of websites that don’t serve the interest
of the business. PLATINUM makes extensive use of C&Cs that use dynamic DNS hosts. Although
such free services can be very useful at a personal level, blocking access to such hosts at a local
DNS server can minimize post-compromise activity.

•

Prepare your network to be forensically ready, so that you can achieve containment and recovery if
a compromise occurs. A forensically ready network that records authentications, password
changes, and other significant network events can help identify affected systems quickly.

•

Make sure that your organization’s Internet-facing assets are always running up-to-date
applications and security updates, and that they are regularly audited for suspicious files and
activity. A number of researched PLATINUM victims had their public-facing infrastructure
compromised through unknown flaws.
