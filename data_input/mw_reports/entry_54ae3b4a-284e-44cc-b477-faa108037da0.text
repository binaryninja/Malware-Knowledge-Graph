Two Defendants Arrested in Malaysia; Remaining Five Defendants,
One of Whom Allegedly Boasted of Connections to the Chinese
Ministry of State Security, are Fugitives in China
In August 2019 and August 2020, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., returned two
separate indictments charging five computer hackers, all of whom were residents and
nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), with computer intrusions affecting over
100 victim companies in the United States and abroad, including software development
companies, computer hardware manufacturers, telecommunications providers, social media
companies, video game companies, non-profit organizations, universities, think tanks, and
foreign governments, as well as pro-democracy politicians and activists in Hong Kong.
The intrusions, which security researchers have tracked using the threat labels “APT41,”
“Barium,” “Winnti,” “Wicked Panda,” and “Wicked Spider,” facilitated the theft of source code,
software code signing certificates, customer account data, and valuable business

information. These intrusions also facilitated the defendants’ other criminal schemes,
including ransomware and “crypto-jacking” schemes, the latter of which refers to the group’s
unauthorized use of victim computers to “mine” cryptocurrency.
Also in August 2020, the same federal grand jury returned a third indictment charging two
Malaysian businessmen who conspired with two of the Chinese hackers to profit from
computer intrusions targeting the video game industry in the United States and abroad.
Shortly thereafter, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued arrest warrants
for the two businessmen. On Sept. 14, 2020, pursuant to a provisional arrest request from
the United States with a view to their extradition, Malaysian authorities arrested them in
Sitiawan. The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided
by the Government of Malaysia, including the Attorney General’s Chambers of Malaysia and
the Royal Malaysia Police.
In addition to arrest warrants for all of the charged defendants, in September 2020, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia issued seizure warrants that resulted in the recent
seizure of hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names, and command-and-control (C2”)
“dead drop” web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion
offenses. The FBI executed the warrants in coordination with other actions by several
private-sector companies, which included disabling numerous accounts for violations of the
companies’ terms of service. In addition, in partnership with the department, Microsoft
developed and implemented technical measures to block this threat actor from accessing
victims’ computer systems. The actions by Microsoft were a significant part of the overall
effort to deny the defendants continued access to hacking infrastructure, tools, accounts, and
command and control domain names. In coordination with today’s announcement, the FBI
has also released a Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report that contains critical, relevant
technical information collected by the FBI for use by specific private-sector partners.
“The department of Justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer
intrusions and cyberattacks by these Chinese citizens,” said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey
A. Rosen. “Regrettably, the Chinese communist party has chosen a different path of making
China safe for cybercriminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal
intellectual property helpful to China.”
“Today’s charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to
conduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the
department’s determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the
private sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,” said Assistant
Attorney General John C. Demers. “This is the only way to neutralize malicious nation state
cyber activity.”
“Today’s announcement demonstrates the ramifications faced by the hackers in China but it
is also a reminder to those who continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics that we will utilize
every tool we have to administer justice,” said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. “The
2/6

arrests in Malaysia are a direct result of partnership, cooperation and collaboration. As the
cyber threat continues to evolve larger than any one agency can address, the FBI remains
committed to being an indispensable partner to our federal, international and private sector
partners to stop rampant cyber crime and hold those carrying out these kind of actions
accountable.”
“The scope and sophistication of the crimes in these unsealed indictments is unprecedented.
The alleged criminal scheme used actors in China and Malaysia to illegally hack, intrude and
steal information from victims worldwide,” said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. “As set forth in the charging documents, some of these criminal
actors believed their association with the PRC provided them free license to hack and steal
across the globe. This scheme also contained a new and troubling cyber-criminal
component – the targeting and utilization of gaming platforms to both defraud video game
companies and launder illicit proceeds.”
“The actions announced today reflect a years-long commitment by the FBI Washington Field
Office to pursue the perpetrators of the computer intrusion campaigns described in the
indictments, and to bring those perpetrators to justice,” said Acting Assistant Director in
Charge James A. Dawson, FBI Washington Field Office. “This case demonstrates the FBI’s
dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter where they are, and to whom they may be
connected.”
The August 2019 indictment charged Zhang Haoran (张浩然), 35, and Tan Dailin (谭戴林),
35, with 25 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money laundering, and
violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”). The indictment charged Zhang
and Tan with participating in a “Computer Hacking Conspiracy,” which targeted hightechnology and similar organizations. The indictment also charged that, as an additional way
to make money, Zhang and Tan participated in a “Video Game Conspiracy,” through which
Zhang and Tan, together with others, sought to make money by hacking video game
companies, obtaining and otherwise generating digital items of value (e.g., video game
currency), and then selling such items for profit. In several instances, they used their
unauthorized access to gaming company networks take action against other unrelated
groups engaged in the same fraudulent generation of gaming artifacts, thereby attempting to
eliminate the criminal competition.
One of the August 2020, indictments charged Jiang Lizhi (蒋立志), 35, Qian Chuan (钱川),
39, and Fu Qiang (付强), 37, with nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to
violate the CFAA, substantive violations of the CFAA, access device fraud, identity theft,
aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. The racketeering conspiracy pertained to
the three defendants’ conducting the affairs of Chengdu 404 Network Technology (“Chengdu
404”), a PRC company, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion
offenses affecting over 100 victim companies, organizations, and individuals in the United
States and around the world, including in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and
3/6

Vietnam. The defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India
and Vietnam, and targeted, but did not compromise, government computer networks in the
United Kingdom. In one notable instance, the defendants conducted a ransomware attack
on the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to combating global poverty.
The defendants associated with Chengdu 404 employed sophisticated hacking techniques to
gain and maintain access to victim computer networks. One example was the defendants’
use of “supply chain attacks,” in which the hackers compromised software providers and
then modified the providers’ code to facilitate further intrusions against the software
providers’ customers. Another example was the hackers’ use of C2 “dead drops,” which are
seemingly legitimate web pages that the hackers created, but which were surreptitiously
encoded instructions to their malware. However, they also employed publicly available
exploits and tools, including the following common vulnerabilities and exposures (“CVE”):
CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-20191652/CVE-2019-1653, and CVE-2020-10189.
The second August 2020 indictment charged Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32,
both Malaysian nationals and residents, with 23 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, identity
theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, money laundering, violations of the
CFAA, and falsely registering domain names. The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling
conducted the affairs of Sea Gamer Mall, a Malaysian company founded by Wong, through a
pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses targeting the video
game industry in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The
indictment alleged that Wong and Ling worked with various hackers, including Zhang and
Tan, to profit from the hackers’ criminal computer intrusions at video game companies.
The indictment against Zhang and Tan charges the defendants with two counts of conspiracy
to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two
counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison; five counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison;
nine counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison; four counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer,
which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of aggravated identity
theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money
laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
The indictment against Jiang, Qian, and Fu charges the defendants with one count of
racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count
of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison; one count of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer,
which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of threatening to
damage a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison;
one count of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison;
4/6

one count of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one
count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison;
and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison.
The indictment against Wong and Ling charges the defendants with one count of
racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count
of racketeering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; three counts of
intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
in prison; five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a
maximum sentence of five years in prison; five counts of furthering fraud by unauthorized
access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison;
two counts of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison;
two counts of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one
count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison;
and three counts of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison. The indictment also alleges false registration of domain names, which would
increase the maximum sentence of imprisonment for money laundering to 27 years; the
maximum sentence of imprisonment for unlawful access to a protected computer to 10 years
instead of five years; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for intentional damage to a
protected computer to 17 years instead of 10 years; and the mandatory sentence of
imprisonment for aggravated identity theft to four years instead of two years.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided
here for informational purposes only; any sentencing's of the defendants will be determined
by the assigned judge.
The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of
Columbia, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI’s
Washington Field Office. The FBI’s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along
