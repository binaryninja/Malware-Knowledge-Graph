Vulnerable Exchange server hit by Squirrelwaffle and
financial fraud

February 15, 2022

The Sophos Rapid Response team recently investigated an incident where the Squirrelwaffle
malware loader was used in conjunction with the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell exploits to
target an unpatched Microsoft Exchange server. The attackers leveraged the vulnerable
server to mass distribute Squirrelwaffle to both internal and external recipients by inserting
malicious replies into employees’ existing email threads (known as email thread hijacking.)

Sophos has encountered this approach before, but, on this occasion, there was also
something new going on. The incident investigators discovered that while the malicious
spam campaign was being implemented, the same vulnerable server was also used for a
financial fraud attack using knowledge extracted from a stolen email thread.

What is Squirrelwaffle?
Squirrelwaffle is a malware loader that is distributed as a malicious office document in spam
campaigns. It provides attackers with an initial foothold in a victim’s environment and a
channel to deliver and infect systems with other malware. When a recipient opens a
Squirrelwaffle-infected document and enables macros, a visual basic script typically
downloads and executes Cobalt Strike Beacons, giving control of the computer to an
attacker.

The twist
In a typical Squirrelwaffle attack leveraging a vulnerable Exchange server, the attack ends
when defenders detect and remediate the breach by patching the vulnerabilities, removing
the attacker’s ability to send emails through the server.
In the incident investigated by Sophos Rapid Response, however, such remediation wouldn’t
have stopped the financial fraud attack because the attackers had exported an email thread
about customer payments from the victim’s Exchange server. (Further, as noted below,
patching isn’t the final solution for remediating vulnerable Exchange servers, you also need
to investigate to see if there was any other impact, such as the installation of web shells.)
Using knowledge obtained from the thread, the attackers registered a “typo-squatted”
domain (one that appears to be the victim’s domain but with a small typo) that they then used
to reply to the email thread. Moving the conversation out of the victim’s email infrastructure
gave the attackers operational control over what happened next.
The attackers replied to the email thread using email addresses from the typo-squatted
domain and attempted to redirect the victim’s customer’s payments to themselves.
To add further legitimacy to the conversation, the attackers copied additional email
addresses to give the impression that they were requesting support from an internal
department. In fact, the additional addresses were also created by the attacker under the
typo-squatted domain.
The attackers set the stage for a legitimate financial transaction to be redirected to a bank
account under their control:

A follow up email references the new banking details and tries to create a sense of urgency.
The attackers followed up almost every day for the next six days with the tone growing
increasingly agitated:

The attacker changed their tone after receiving an email indicating that the payment was
being processed:

The attackers very nearly achieved their goal. The victim organization initiated a transfer of
money to the attackers, however, one of the financial institutions involved in the transaction
flagged the transaction as fraudulent and so the transfer did not complete.

Protecting against malicious email attacks
The single biggest step defenders can take to prevent the compromise and abuse of on
premises Microsoft Exchange servers is to ensure that they have been patched with the
most recent updates from Microsoft.

Next, defenders can make it easier for other organizations to determine the legitimacy of
emails coming from their domain, for instance by implementing industry recognized
standards for email authentication, such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM
(DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain Message Authentication Reporting and
Conformance.) Using these standards can make it harder for an attacker to send spoofed
emails impersonating your domain.
As attackers become increasingly skilled at social engineering, creating sophisticated
phishing lures and impersonation messages, and more, it may be time to start using email
security products that integrate artificial intelligence.
Last but not least, defenders need to protect the recipients of such emails and ensure that
users in their organization can spot phishing attempts and know how to report and respond
to them.

I’ve been attacked – what now?
If you suspect you have been the target of a Squirrelwaffle or financial fraud attack, there are
some practical steps you can take.
Use the Sophos Rapid Response Squirrelwaffle Incident Guide to help you investigate,
analyze and respond to an incident involving Squirrelwaffle.
Implement your incident response plan. If you don’t have one or don’t feel you have the
right resources to contain and neutralize the attack, call on a third party incident
response team, such as Sophos Rapid Response.
Get patching. Update the software on any vulnerable on premises Microsoft Exchange
servers – and check after patching for any web shells left behind by the attackers for
later access.
If your domain has been typo-squatted, you can file an abuse complaint with the
domain registrar of the typo-squatted domain. This process will vary depending on the
registrar.
If a malicious spam campaign was conducted from your compromised Exchange
server, make sure your organization’s legitimate domain or email infrastructure has
been flagged as a spam sender. Check whether you have been blacklisted. You can
ask to be removed from the list, but it is sometimes worth staying on it until no further
spam is detected from your domain as that could help to prevent some of your
legitimate emails from being inadvertently delivered to external recipients.

Conclusion
The combination of Squirrelwaffle, ProxyLogon, and ProxyShell has been encountered by
the Sophos Rapid Response team multiple times in the last few months, but this is the first
time we have seen attackers use typo-squatting to maintain the ability to send spam once
the Exchange server has been remediated.
