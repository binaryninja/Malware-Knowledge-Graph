The DarkSide Ransomware operation claims they are creating a distributed storage system
in Iran to store and leak data stolen from victims. To show they mean business, the
ransomware gang has deposited $320 thousand on a hacker forum.
DarkSide is run as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) where developers are in charge of
programming the ransomware software and payment site, and affiliates are recruited to
hack businesses and encrypt their devices.
As part of this arrangement, the DarkSide ransomware developers receive a 10-25% cut,
and an affiliate gets 75-90% of any ransom payments they generate.
As DarkSide is a private operation, hackers who want to distribute their ransomware
must first apply for access.

Distributed storage system to leak data
Yesterday, cybersecurity intelligence firm Kela shared a new topic posted by the DarkSide
Ransomware operators on a Russian-speaking hacker forum with BleepingComputer.
In this topic, DarkSide has stated that they are working on a distributed storage system to
store and leak victims' stolen data.
Since late 2019, ransomware operations have been actively performing a double-extortion
strategy of stealing unencrypted data and then encrypting the victim's computers. The
encrypted files and the threat to publicly release data on ransomware data leak sites are
used to extort victims into paying the ransom.
To disrupt these extortion demands, law enforcement and cybersecurity firms actively try to
take down these data leak sites.
To prevent this, DarkSide states that they plan to create a distributed "sustainable storage
system" in Iran to host the victim's stolen data for six months.
"Some targets think that if a lot of data has been downloaded from them, then after their
publication, hackers and other people will download it for a long time through the TOR. We
think so too, so we will change it."
"We are already working on a sustainable storage system for your data. All your data will be
replicated between multiple servers, blocking one server won't delete data."
"Those companies that have already been published will be uploaded there, their data will
be guaranteed to be stored for 6 months. So you can download their data much faster."
"We will specifically use servers in Iran or unrecognized republics so that you cannot block
them, and an automatic system will determine the availability and give you a suitable
download link," the DarkSide operators stated.
They state that all the stolen data will be replicated between the various servers, so if one
server is taken down, the data could still be accessed from the others.

DarkSide deposits $320 thousand on a hacker forum
As part of this same forum topic, the DarkSide operation announced that they were looking
for new Russian affiliates to join their program, who they claim to earn an average of $400k
per victim.
As part of this recruitment drive, affiliates must pass an interview and answer any questions
the developers have about their level of experience.

"Pass an interview, show your work and payments, answer the necessary questions." DarkSide developers.
Unlike other ransomware operations, such as Ryuk, Egregor, and others, DarkSide states
that do not allow attacks on:
Medicine (hospitals, hospices).
Education (schools, universities).
Non-profit organizations.
Government sector.
It is too soon to tell if DarkSide will keep its promises about not targeting
these organizations.
In addition to recruiting affiliates, DarkSide states that they are willing to spend 400K to
hackers with access to large companies in the USA that can be encrypted.
To back up their claims, the DarkSide gang deposited 20 bitcoins on the forum, which is
worth approximately $320 thousand at today's values.

Deposit of 20 bitcoins
As you can see below, the public-facing representative of DarkSide, known as 'darksupp',
now has 20 bitcoins deposited in their account.

These deposited bitcoins can then be transferred to other members to purchase software,
services, or information.
This show of wealth is similar to REvil's recruitment drive in September when they
deposited $1 million in bitcoins to the same forum.
