Introduction
The ransomware landscape is a complex, crowded and rapidly evolving ecosystem. New
and rebranded groups appear and disappear continuously, while the operators behind them
share, rent, steal, or copy each other’s attack tools, playbooks and even infrastructure.
Sophos has been monitoring and reporting on the ransomware landscape for years, building
an unrivalled library of insight and analysis. The Ransomware Threat Intelligence Center
brings together a curated list of the most important research articles and reports published by
Sophos on prevalent, new, and emerging ransomware threats, including their tools,
techniques, and behaviors, from 2018 to the present. The content will be updated regularly
as new material becomes available.
For further information on ransomware, including advice on security best practice and the
latest State of Ransomware report, visit Sophos’ Resources to Stop Ransomware.
