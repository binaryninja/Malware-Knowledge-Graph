Seizure Documents Describe Iranian Government’s Efforts to Use
Domains as Part of Global Disinformation Campaign
The United States has seized 92 domain names that were unlawfully used by Iran’s Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to engage in a global disinformation campaign,
announced the Department of Justice.
According to the seizure documents, four of the domains purported to be genuine news
outlets but were actually controlled by the IRGC and targeted the United States for the
spread of Iranian propaganda to influence United States domestic and foreign policy in
violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), and the remainder spread Iranian
propaganda to other parts of the world. In addition, the seizure documents describe how all
92 domains were being used in violation of U.S. sanctions targeting both the Government of
Iran and the IRGC.
“We will continue to use all of our tools to stop the Iranian Government from misusing U.S.
companies and social media to spread propaganda covertly, to attempt to influence the
American public secretly, and to sow discord,” said Assistant Attorney General for National
1/4

Security John C. Demers. “Fake news organizations have become a new outlet for
disinformation spread by authoritarian countries as they continue to try to undermine our
democracy. Today’s actions show that we can use a variety of laws to vindicate the value of
transparency.”
“Today we are 92 domains closer to shutting down Iran’s worldwide disinformation
campaign,” said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California. “This
important work will continue. Iran cannot be allowed to hide behind fake news sites. If Iran
wants to be heard using U.S. facilities, it must reveal its true colors.”
“Today, we successfully seized 92 domains involved in a disinformation campaign conducted
by Iran-based actors to promote pro-Iranian propaganda. This investigation, initiated by
intelligence we received from Google, was a collaborative effort between the FBI and social
media companies Google, Facebook, and Twitter,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge
Bennett. “This case is a perfect example of why the FBI San Francisco Division prioritizes
maintaining an ongoing relationship with a variety of social media and technology
companies. These relationships enable a quick exchange of information to better protect
against threats to the nation’s security and our democratic processes. The FBI also urges the
public to remain vigilant about the information they find and share on social media. Every
citizen must do their part to use a critical eye and look for trusted sources of information. We
all have a role to play in protecting the American democratic system from foreign
adversaries.”
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unauthorized
exports of goods, technology or services to Iran, directly or indirectly from the United States
or by a United States person are prohibited. Pursuant to the IEEPA, the Secretary of the
Treasury promulgated the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR) that
prohibit the provision of services to the Government of Iran without a license. The
Department of Treasury may issue a license through its Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC). Further, the United States has found that the IRGC has provided material support
to a number of terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban and, on April 15,
2019, the IRGC was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States
Government.
In this case, the United States seized 92 domain names on Oct. 7, 2020, pursuant to a
seizure warrant. The seizure documents describe how the 92 seized domain names were
being operated in violation of federal law.
Four of the domain names, “newsstand7.com,” “usjournal.net,” “usjournal.us,” and
“twtoday.net,” were seized pursuant to FARA. FARA establishes a registration, reporting,
and disclosure regime for agents of foreign principals (which includes foreign nongovernment individuals and entities) so that the U.S. government and the people of the
United States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons
attempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and law. FARA requires, among other
2/4

things, that persons subject to its requirements submit periodic registration statements
containing truthful information about their activities and the income earned from them.
Disclosure of the required information allows the federal government and the American
people to evaluate the statements and activities of such persons in light of their function as
foreign agents. Here, the four domains purported to be independent news outlets, but were
actually operated by or on behalf of the IRGC to target the United States with pro-Iranian
propaganda in an attempt to influence the American people to change United States foreign
and domestic policy toward Iran and the Middle East. These domains targeted a United
States audience without proper registration pursuant to FARA and without notifying the
American public with a conspicuous notice that the content of the domains was being
published on behalf of the IRGC and the Government of Iran.
In addition, the remaining 88 domains targeted audiences in Western Europe, the Middle
East, and South East Asia and masqueraded as genuine news outlets while actually being
operated by the IRGC to spread pro-Iranian disinformation around the globe to the benefit of
the Government of Iran. The Government of Iran and the IRGC utilized website and domain
services in the United States without a license from OFAC. All 92 domains are owned and
operated by United States companies. Neither the IRGC nor the Government of Iran
obtained a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to utilizing the domain
names. A list of the 92 seized domain names is available here.
