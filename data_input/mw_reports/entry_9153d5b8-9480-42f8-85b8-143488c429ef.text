Over the past year, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has observed a gradual
evolution of the tools, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious network operators
based in Iran. At CyberWarCon 2021, MSTIC analysts presented their analysis of these
trends in Iranian nation state actor activity during a session titled “The Iranian evolution:
Observed changes in Iranian malicious network operations”. This blog is intended to
summarize the content of that research and the topics covered in their presentation and
demonstrate MSTIC’s ongoing efforts to track these actors and protect customers from the
related threats.
MSTIC consistently tracks threat actor activity, including the groups discussed in this blog,
and works across Microsoft Security products and services to build detections into our
products that improve customer protections. We are sharing this blog today so that others in
the community can also be aware of the latest techniques we have observed being used by
Iranian actors.
As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified customers that
have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the information they need to help
secure their accounts. Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to

an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as
a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the
actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, a DEV is converted to a named actor.
Three notable trends in Iranian nation-state operators have emerged:
They are increasingly utilizing ransomware to either collect funds or disrupt their
targets.
They are more patient and persistent while engaging with their targets.
While Iranian operators are more patient and persistent with their social engineering
campaigns, they continue to employ aggressive brute force attacks on their targets.

Ransomware
Since September 2020, MSTIC has observed six Iranian threat groups deploying
ransomware to achieve their strategic objectives. These ransomware deployments were
launched in waves every six to eight weeks on average.

Figure 1: Timeline of ransomware attacks by Iranian threat actors
In one observed campaign, PHOSPHORUS targeted the Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN and
unpatched on-premises Exchange Servers globally with the intent of deploying ransomware
on vulnerable networks. A recent blog post by the DFIR Report describes a similar intrusion
in which actors leveraged vulnerabilities in on-premise Exchange Servers to compromise a
victim environment and encrypt systems via BitLocker. MSTIC also attributes this activity to
PHOSPHORUS. PHOSPHORUS operators conducted widespread scanning and ransomed
targeted systems through a five-step process: Scan, Exploit, Review, Stage, Ransom.

Scan
In the early part of 2021, PHOSPHORUS actors scanned millions of IPs on the internet for
Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN that were vulnerable to CVE-2018-13379. This vulnerability
allowed the attackers to collect clear-text credentials from the sessions file on vulnerable
Fortinet VPN appliances. The actors collected credentials from over 900 Fortinet VPN
servers in the United States, Europe, and Israel so far this year. In the last half of 2021,
PHOSPHORUS shifted to scanning for unpatched on-premises Exchange Servers
vulnerable to ProxyShell (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE2021-27065).

Exploit
When they identified vulnerable servers, PHOSPHORUS sought to gain persistence on the
target systems. In some instances, the actors downloaded a Plink runner named
MicrosoftOutLookUpdater.exe. This file would beacon periodically to their C2 servers via
SSH, allowing the actors to issue further commands. Later, the actors would download a
custom implant via a Base64-encoded PowerShell command. This implant established
persistence on the victim system by modifying startup registry keys and ultimately functioned
as a loader to download additional tools.

Review
After gaining persistence, PHOSPHORUS actors triaged hundreds of victims to determine
which of them were fitting for actions on objectives. On select victims, operators created local
administrator accounts with a with a username of “help” and password of “_AS_@1394” via
the commands below. On occasion, actors dumped LSASS to acquire credentials to be used
later for lateral movement.

Stage and Ransom
Finally, MSTIC observed PHOSPHORUS employing BitLocker to encrypt data and ransom
victims at several targeted organizations. BitLocker is a full volume encryption feature meant
to be used for legitimate purposes. After compromising the initial server (through vulnerable
VPN or Exchange Server), the actors moved laterally to a different system on the victim
network to gain access to higher value resources. From there, they deployed a script to
encrypt the drives on multiple systems. Victims were instructed to reach out to a specific
Telegram page to pay for the decryption key.

Patience and persistence
MSTIC has observed PHOSPHORUS threat actors employing social engineering to build
rapport with their victims before targeting them. These operations likely required significant
investment in the operator’s time and resources to refine and execute. This trend indicates
PHOSPHORUS is either moving away from or expanding on their past tactics of sending
unsolicited links and attachments in spear-phishing email campaigns to attempt credential
theft.

PHOSHORUS – Patient and persistent
PHOSPHORUS sends “interview requests” to target individuals through emails that contain
tracking links to confirm whether the user has opened the file. Once a response is received
from the target user, PHOSPHORUS attackers send a link to a benign list of interview
questions hosted on a cloud service provider. The attackers continue with several back-andforth conversations discussing the questions with the target user before finally sending a
meeting invite with a link masquerading as a Google Meeting.
Once the meeting invite is sent, the attackers continuously reach out to the target user,
asking them to test the Google Meeting link. The attackers contact the targeted user multiple
times per day, continuously pestering them to click the link. The attackers even go so far as
to offer to call the target user to walk them through clicking the link. The attackers are more
than willing to troubleshoot any issues the user has signing into the fake Google Meeting
link, which leads to a credential harvesting page.
MSTIC has observed PHOSPHORUS operators become very aggressive in their emails after
the initial lure is sent, to the point where they are almost demanding a response from the
targeted user.

CURIUM – In it for the long run
CURIUM is another Iranian threat actor group that has shown a great deal of patience when
targeting users. Instead of phishing emails, CURIUM actors leverage a network of fictitious
social media accounts to build trust with targets and deliver malware.
These attackers have followed the following playbook:
Masquerade as an attractive woman on social media
Chat with the target daily
Send benign videos of the woman to the target to prime them to lower their guard
Send malicious files to the target similar the benign files previously sent

4/7

Request that the target user open the malicious document
Exfiltrate data from the victim machine
The process above can take multiple months from the initial connection to the delivery of the
malicious document. The attackers build a relationship with target users over time by having
constant and continuous communications which allows them to build trust and confidence
with the target. In many of the cases we have observed, the targets genuinely believed that
they were making a human connection and not interacting with a threat actor operating from
Iran.
By exercising patience, building relationships, and pestering targets continuously once a
relationship has been formed, Iranian threat actors have had more success in compromising
their targets.

Brute force
In 2021, MSTIC observed DEV-0343 aggressively targeting Office 365 tenants via an
ongoing campaign of password spray attacks. DEV-0343 is a threat actor MSTIC assesses
to be likely operating in support of Iranian interests. MSTIC has blogged about DEV-0343
activity previously.
Analysis of Office 365 logs suggests that DEV-0343 is using a red team tool like o365spray
to conduct these attacks.
Targeting in this DEV-0343 activity has been observed across defense companies that
support United States, European Union, and Israeli government partners producing militarygrade radars, drone technology, satellite systems, and emergency response communication
systems. Further activity has targeted customers in geographic information systems (GIS),
spatial analytics, regional ports of entry in the Persian Gulf, and several maritime and cargo
transportation companies with a business focus in the Middle East.
As we discussed in our previous blog, DEV-0343 operators’ ‘pattern of life’ is consistent with
the working schedule of actors based in Iran. DEV-0343 operator activity peaked Sunday
through Thursday between 04:00:00 and 16:00:00 UTC.

Figure 3: DEV-0343 observed actor requests per day
Known DEV-0343 operators have also been observed targeting the same account on the
same tenant being targeted by other known Iranian operators. For example, EUROPIUM
operators attempted to access a specific account on June 12, 2021 and ultimately gained
access to this account on June 13, 2021. DEV-0343 was then observed targeting this same
account within minutes of EUROPIUM operators gaining access to it the same day. MSTIC
assesses that these observed overlapping activities suggest a coordination between different
Iranian actors pursuing common objectives.

Closing thoughts: Increasingly capable threat actors
As Iranian operators have adapted both their strategic goals and tradecraft, over time they
have evolved into more competent threat actors capable of conducting a full spectrum of
operations including:
Information operations
Disruption and destruction
Support to physical operations
Specifically, Iranian operators have proven themselves to be both willing and able to:
Deploy ransomware
Deploy disk wipers
Deploy mobile malware
Conduct phishing attacks
Conduct password spray attacks
Conduct mass exploitation attacks
Conduct supply chain attacks
Cloak C2 communications behind legitimate cloud services

MSTIC thanks CyberWarCon 2021 for the opportunity to present this research to the broader
security community. Microsoft will continue to monitor all this activity by Iranian actors and
implement protections for our customers.
