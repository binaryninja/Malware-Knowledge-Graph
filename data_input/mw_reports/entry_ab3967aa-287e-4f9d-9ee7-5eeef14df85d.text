Today a press conference was held by the City of Oldsmar where they disclosed ‘the
unlawful intrusion of the City of Oldsmar’s water treatment system.’ The City of
Oldsmar should be commended on their transparent briefing and level of detail. The case
is evolving and details are ongoing but this blog is intended to share what’s known currently
with some defensive recommendations.

Details of What Happened
It has been publicly acknowledged that an operator machine had a remote access software
package– TeamViewer- installed and accessible to the Internet. This led to manipulation
of control set points for the dosing rate of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) into the water. NaOH
is a chemical often used in drinking water treatment used to adjust pH
and alkalinity. Although an important component of the drinking water treatment process,
NaOH can be a hazardous chemical to water consumers if concentrations exist in excess of
safe operating parameters.
Typically, water systems are engineered with many safeguards to keep parameters within
acceptable limits not the least of which is trained and licensed drinking water treatment
operators. In this incident, the adversary raised the NaOH dose setpoint from its normal
setting of 100 parts-per-million (ppm) to 11,100ppm, thereby temporarily increasing the
amount of chemical being added to the water. It was reported that the water treatment
operator on duty observed the mouse moving on the operating screen, making
changes, and then exiting the system. It was also reported that the operator identified the
incident and restored the normal operating parameters fast enough so that pH monitoring
alarms did not detect a level beyond acceptable parameters.
Had the operator not observed the attacker actively manipulating the screen, it
is possible that several other mechanisms in the water treatment plant control and
monitoring system would have alerted plant staff to the condition. However, it is also entirely
possible that this action could have resulted in people getting sick or potentially even
death. The control systems in modern water treatment
plants use process instrumentation that continuously monitor water quality
parameters (e.g. pH) to carefully control the addition of chemicals and provide real-time
alerts when those parameters go outside acceptable limits; these critical parameters
are typically monitored at multiple points throughout the treatment process and in the
transmission and distribution systems.
However, even these safeguards are not adversary proof. As with all critical industrial
processes, Dragos recommends that organizations proactively monitor for several key
events within their control systems including changes to setpoints of critical process
parameters, changes to control logic, and disabling capabilities for remote edits to process

control logic by default. Additionally, organizations should consider utilizing distinct safety
systems, isolated from the control network, to prevent incidents that could result in harm
to personnel or the populations dependent on their service.

What is TeamViewer?
TeamViewer is a legitimate software package that is directly installed on a Windows host
that allows for easy connectivity from anywhere. Its ease of use has allowed it to
increasingly be used in industrial environments and, while legitimate software, may be
unauthorized or rogue software.
Remote access to industrial facilities can be architected safely. But the best architecture can
also be circumvented with unapproved software such as TeamViewer. This is where
visibility into what software, vulnerabilities, and behaviors are necessary in your industrial
environments.
If you don’t have OT visibility software (such as the Dragos Platform) you can manually
assess if TeamViewer is in your environment.
TeamViewer, by default, uses both TCP/5938 and UDP/5938 ports to establish connections
with TeamViewer. If those are blocked by a firewall or other perimeter system TeamViewer
falls back to TCP/443 and then TCP/80 (commonly used for HTTPS and HTTP
traffic). These connections are managed by TeamViewer’s cloud environment and will
resolve hosts going to *.teamviewer.com (The Dragos team looks for the specific hosts
masterN.teamviewer.com, pingN.teamviewer.com, or server.teamviewer.com where N is
a one- or double-digit number such as master9.teamviewer.com or
router15.teamviewer.com).

Recommendations
Manually identify software installed on hosts, particularly those critical to the industrial
environment such as operator workstations- such as TeamViewer or VNC. Accessing
this on a host-by-host basis may not be practical but it is comprehensive.

Beyond host data, there are a variety of network traffic sources to help identify
TeamViewer. Most environments are not configured where centralized logging is
occurring and can be a manual process. We recommend:
Use DNS logging to identify outbound DNS resolution to *.teamviewer.com
Encrypted communications to teamviewer.com will have a X509 certificate for
*.teamviewer.com
Use perimeter logging or other network logging to identify external
communications via TCP/5938 and UDP/5938.
Talk to the operations staff or IT staff at the site to determine if other remote
software tools such as virtual private networks are used. If so, perform searches
for those tools and where possible utilize multi-factor authentication on remote
connections.
From a prevention perspective, blocking these communications, and all egress
communications that are not explicitly approved, will prevent remote access solutions
like TeamViewer. However, ensure that you talk with plant personnel before doing this
and after blocking any connections be available to reverse the changes if something
was necessary that they did not know about.

Architecting Secure Remote Access for OT/ICS
In March of 2020, in recognition of the early days of the global pandemic, we released a
blog focusing on secure remote access titled A Matter of Trust: Remote Access for ICS. All
of the recommendations in that post still apply today and are relevant:
Engineering and OT teams should evaluate what systems can leverage remote
access.
Remote access requirements should be determined, including what IP addresses,
what communication types, and what processes can be monitored. All others should
be disabled by default. Remote access including process control should be limited as
much as possible.
User-initiated access should require multi-factor authentication from the Internet to a
DMZ with a dedicated jump host for ICS-specific communications. This system should
leverage its own identity and access management system.
From the DMZ, after authentication, user-initiated remote access should follow a
trusted path to the industrial control system—where the user will authenticate again,
this time using the local identity and access management solution for the industrial
control system.
All remote access communications should be logged and monitored. Various detection
techniques could be implemented on remote access systems, like looking for brute
force attempts or specific exploits for known vulnerabilities—but only if logging and
monitoring is used.
