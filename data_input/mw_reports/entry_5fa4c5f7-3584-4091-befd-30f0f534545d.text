Executive Summary
Unit 42 researchers have discovered a new variant of eCh0raix ransomware targeting Synology network-attached storage (NAS) and Quality
Network Appliance Provider (QNAP) NAS devices. To achieve this, attackers are also leveraging CVE-2021-28799 to deliver the new eCh0raix
ransomware variant to QNAP devices. While eCh0raix is known ransomware that has historically targeted QNAP and Synology NAS devices
in separate campaigns, this new variant is the first time we’ve seen it combining functionality to target both QNAP and Synology NAS devices,
demonstrating that some ransomware developers are continuing to invest in optimizing the tools used to target devices common in the small
office and home office (SOHO).
We’re regularly seeing attacks with the eCh0raix ransomware variant, which has been active in the wild for nearly a year. As recently as June,
victims have reported paying a modest ransom.
We’re releasing our findings about this new variant of eCh0raix to raise awareness of the ongoing threats to the SOHO and small business
sectors. Coverage of the ransomware crisis tends to focus on threats to large enterprises and government agencies, which are facing
increasingly aggressive and disruptive ransomware attacks. However, the SOHO and small business sectors can contain a large attack
surface for threat actors – for example, some 250,000 QNAP and Synology NAS devices are exposed to the public internet, according to data
from the Cortex Xpanse platform.
SOHO users are attractive to ransomware operators looking to attack bigger targets because attackers can potentially use SOHO NAS
devices as a stepping stone in supply chain attacks on large enterprises that can generate huge ransoms.
Additionally, SOHO users typically do not employ dedicated IT or security professionals, which makes them less prepared to block
ransomware attacks than larger organizations.
We recommend the following best practices for protecting home offices from ransomware attacks:

1/7

Update device firmware to keep attacks of this nature at bay. Details about updating QNAP NAS devices against CVE-2021-28799 can
be found on the QNAP website.
Create complex login passwords to make brute-forcing more difficult for attackers.
Limit connections to SOHO connected devices from only a hard-coded list of recognized IPs to prevent network attacks that are used to
deliver ransomware to devices.

CVE-2021-28799: Exploit in the Wild
On April 22, QNAP released a security advisory to disclose a vulnerability within their Hybrid Backup Sync (HBS 3) software. This software
provides backup, restoration and synchronization functions between local, remote and cloud storage spaces. The vulnerability has been
confirmed as an improper authorization vulnerability. Once exploited, it allows remote attackers to log in to the devices. CVE-2021-28799 is
assigned to this vulnerability.
On June 21, we caught an attack targeting QNAP HBS3 with an exploit of CVE-2021-28799. While this vulnerability has been exploited to
deliver QLocker in the past, this is the first instance we know of in which it is being exploited to deliver eCh0raix (also known as QNAPCrypt)
ransomware. The payload of the malicious request is shown in Figure 1. The attack tried to utilize a hard-coded session ID
"jisoosocoolhbsmgnt" to bypass authentication and execute a command on the device, aiming to fetch malware from the remote server
64[.]42[.]152[.]46 and run it on the victim device. The payload is still live at the time of this writing.

Figure 1. CVE-

2021-28799 exploit.
While eCh0raix has historically targeted QNAP devices, further analysis of the payload led to the discovery that this is a new variant of the
ransomware that also targets Synology devices, thereby increasing its attack surface.

Timeline of the New eCh0raix Ransomware Variant
To the best of our knowledge, details on the eCh0raix ransomware samples targeting these Synology devices were unknown until now.
Instances of Synology devices infected by eCh0raix have been reported from as far back as 2019, but the only previous research connecting
the Synology attacks to eCh0raix actors is based on decryptors that were found.
The first sample we saw of this new ransomware variant combining functionality to target both QNAP and Synology devices is from September
2020. It’s possible that is when the combined variant was authored. Before then, the attackers likely had separate codebases for campaigns
targeting devices from each of the vendors. This is also confirmed by the use of rct_cryptor_universal as the project name in the new variant,
going by the compilation paths present in GoLang binaries (/home/dev/GoglandProjects/src/rct_cryptor_universal). Prior samples of eCh0raix
use the project name qnap_crypt_worker.
We observed other eCh0raix samples between June and September 2020 using the rct_cryptor_universal project name, but the first full-blown
sample with two separate code flows, based on a syno flag (explained below), is from September 2020.
Going by posts from victims in forums, it appears the eCh0raix ransomware is quite active. The attackers have found success extorting ransom
out of victims, an example of which can be seen on BleepingComputer.com, where the ransom was paid as recently as June 16, 2021.
Querying Cortex Xpanse for NAS devices gives us a rough estimate of the number of devices from each vendor connected to the internet (i.e.
the attack surface for this ransomware). Xpanse tells us there are approximately 240,000 internet-connected QNAP NAS devices. In contrast,
Xpanse found approximately 3,500 Synology NAS devices – a much smaller number. This tells us the additional target doesn’t significantly
increase the ransomware’s attack surface.

Technical Analysis
The new variant accepts an additional syno flag as an input parameter. The two accepted flags are explained below in Table 1.
Flag
Name

Description

Significance

2/7

s

start path

A string value that determines the path on the targeted device where the ransomware encrypts files. The default
value is “/”. The exploit we observed in the wild specified this value as “/share/” (see Figure 1). This value is also
ignored if the syno flag is set, in which case the start path value is a hardcoded list of paths.

syno

is syno?

This is a Boolean value accepted by this new variant. By default, it is not set, but if explicitly set using the syno input
parameter, a hardcoded path is used for encrypting files. The hardcoded path used is /volume[X] (where X takes on
values from 0 to 9). This essentially means that the ransomware tries to encrypt the first 10 numbered volumes on
the device. This aligns with the name of the flag syno since Synology NAS devices specifically store their data under
volumes.

Table 1. Input arguments supported by the new variant.

CheckIsRunning: After launch, the ransomware first checks whether another instance of the process is already running. This is done by
checking for a [SampleName].pid file in the temporary directory on the system. The temporary directory location is determined either by the
value of the TMPDIR environment variable, or /tmp is used if the environment variable is not set. If found, the ransomware tries to read an
integer value from this file and kill the corresponding process ID on the system. If it fails to kill the existing process, it prints a message:
“Program is running. Exiting…” and exits. If no existing running process is found, or the ransomware succeeds at killing a previously running
process, it initializes the .pid file in the temporary directory with the value of its own process ID.
checkReadmeExists: Next, the binary checks for the presence of a ransom note file. In the original variant, this file was named
README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt. However, this new variant uses the filename README_FOR_DECRYPT.txtt (with the extra trailing ‘t’). Perhaps
the typo is an easy way for the attackers to distinguish between campaigns. This thread in the QNAP user forum starting March 21, 2021,
shows this new variant has been active and contains victims’ accounts from instances of successful infection.
If this file already exists on the device, the binary exits.
getInfo: If a preexisting ransom note file is not found and program execution continues, the ransomware attempts to connect to a Tor URL via
a hard-coded SOCKS proxy – see Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) below. This URL serves as the command and control (C2) server and
returns a JSON object containing:
The AES key used to encrypt files on the system.
The ransom note.
A Bitcoin address that is included in the ransom note.
We managed to find one of the C2 URLs still live, which returned a response with the JSON object described above, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2. C2

response.
An interesting thing to note is that the new variant uses a different URL format for communicating with the C2 using an API key, instead of
using Campaign ID numbers as the previous variant did (see Table 3 for variant comparison).
If the sample fails to connect to the C2 or receive a meaningful response, it exits with the rather amusing log message, “AES public key not
set!” (AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, thus the concept of public or private keys is moot in this case.)
main: Following all these steps, the ransomware iterates through the list of files at a path determined by the flag values (syno and s) explained
in Table 1. Any files in this path containing the following strings are ignored:
/proc

/boot/

/sys/

/run/

/dev/

/etc/

/home/httpd

/mnt/ext/opt

.system/thumbnail

.system/opt

.config

.qpkg

Table 2. Files excluded from encryption.

3/7

The encryption algorithm used is the same as that used by the original variant (AES CFB), and the same extension (.encrypt)is appended to
encrypted files, with the eCh0raix string used as a marker in the files to verify successful decryption by decryptors. However, this new variant
doesn’t generate the AES key locally, but rather receives it directly from the C2.
The new variant also implements encryption in two stages based on file extensions. The ransomware first iterates through files with the
following 42 extensions and encrypts them:
.arw, .c, .c++, .cfg, .cpp, .cs, .csv, .cxx, .doc, .docb, .docm, .docx, .go, .h, .hwp, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .pdf, .pl, .png, .psd, .py, .rtf, .svg, .tif, .tile, .txt,
.wallet, .xla, .xlam, .xll, .xlm, .xls, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlw, .xps
We hypothesize that this is a higher-priority subset of extensions focusing on data that would be of value to the average user. Thus, it is more
likely for the ransom to be paid to recover this data. These extensions are likely encrypted first to prioritize valuable data in case the
ransomware fails to complete its encryption process.
After the encryption of files with the first set of extensions, files matching a longer list of 530 unique file extensions are encrypted. These are
included in the appendix. We noticed the .docx extension is included on both lists, so those files would get encrypted twice.
The original variant targeted a total of 563 unique extensions, all encrypted as part of the same routine (also included in the appendix).

Conclusion
The discussion of this new variant of eCh0raix ransomware provides an example of the ongoing threats to the SOHO and small business
sectors. These sectors represent a large attack surface for threat actors – for example, some 250,000 QNAP and Synology NAS devices are
exposed to the public internet, according to data from the Cortex Xpanse platform.
SOHO users are attractive to ransomware operators looking to attack bigger targets because attackers can potentially use SOHO NAS
devices as a stepping stone in supply chain attacks on large enterprises that can generate huge ransoms.
Additionally, SOHO users typically do not employ dedicated IT or security professionals, which makes them less prepared to block
