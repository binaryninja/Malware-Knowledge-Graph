Since its first emergence in November 2021, the Cybereason Nocturnus team has been tracking
the BlackCat Ransomware (aka ALPHV), which has been called “2021’s most sophisticated
ransomware”.
BlackCat ransomware gained notoriety quickly leaving a trail of destruction behind it, among its
recent victims are German oil companies, an Italian luxury fashion brand and a Swiss Aviation
company.

The Cybereason XDR Platform Detects and Blocks BlackCat Ransomware
Since its recent emergence, BlackCat has attacked various industries, including
telecommunication, commercial services, insurance, retail, machinery, pharmaceuticals,
transportation, and construction industries. Among the affected regions are Germany, France,
Spain, the Philippines, and the Netherlands, with the most victims being located in the US.
The ransomware was given the name “BlackCat” due to the favicon of a black cat being used on
every victim's Tor payment site. The operators of BlackCat have been using the names “alphv”
and “ransom” in Cybercrime forums (ramp_v2, exploit.in) in order to recruit affiliates.
The operators of the ransomware appear to be from Russian speaking regions. Like many others,
BlackCat uses a RaaS model (Ransomware-as-a-service). Affiliates of BlackCat are offered
between 80-90% of the ransom payment, and once approved, are given access to a control panel
that manages access:

Leaked document from BlackCat Leaks website
One of the unique elements of the BlackCat ransomware is that it is written in Rust, which is not a
common coding language for malware and ransomware. “Rust is a multi-paradigm, generalpurpose programming language designed for performance and safety.”
Because of Rust’s emphasis on performance, the process of encryption is very fast, and in
addition, Rust is cross-platform, which makes it easier to create variants for both Windows and
Linux.

The operators of BlackCat confirmed that they are affiliates of DarkSide/BlackMatter ransomware
gang. They claim to be apolitical in regards to geopolitical relations and to refrain from attacking
medical institutions and hospitals.
The group has adopted the popular double extortion paradigm, which means that in addition to
encrypting files, they also steal them and later threaten to publish stolen data unless the ransom is
paid. In some cases even, triple extortion is used - threatening to perform DDOS attacks.

Key Details
Sophisticated Ransomware: BlackCat has been called “2021’s most sophisticated
ransomware
High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given
the destructive potential of the attacks.
Developed in Rust: BlackCat was developed in rust which is unusual for ransomware.
Triple Extortion: The BlackCat operators used double extortion and sometimes triple
extortion to make victims pay the ransom
Shared Infrastructure with LockBit: BlackCat has shared infrastructure, and used similar
tools and naming conventions as the LockBit ransomware.
Detected and Prevented: The Cybereason XDR Platform fully detects and prevents the
Lorenz ransomware.

Technical Analysis
Breaking down BlackCat Ransomware
The BlackCat ransomware has both Windows and Linux variants. The ransomware includes
multiple execution flags which grant its operators control over operations like whether to stop
executions of virtual machines or if the ransomware should change the desktop wallpaper or not:

BlackCat help menu
In order to execute properly, BlackCat must be executed with the “--access-token” flag, although
the value of the string that is passed on to it can be any string.
Upon execution, BlackCat may attempt to perform Privilege escalation in the following manners:
UAC bypass by abusing the Connection Manager Admin API Helper for Setup COM
interface (cmstplua.dll)
Abusing CVE-2016-0099 (Secondary Logon Service exploit)
Adjusting access token token privileges
Next, BlackCat checks the UUID (universally unique identifier) of the machine by running a WMI
command, which is used later for the recovery URL in the ransom note:
wmic csproduct get UUID
BlackCat enables local and remote symbolic links on the infected machine. A symbolic link is a
type of file that contains a reference to another file. This is probably done to make sure that the
ransomware is able to follow shortcuts on the machine in order to find the original file to encrypt:
fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1
fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1
BlackCat also attempts to stop Internet services on the infected machine using the iisreset.exe:
iisreset.exe /stop

4/17

The ransomware changes the number of outstanding requests that can be maintained. An
outstanding request is a request that is still waiting for a response. These are used when
performing SMB requests, the change is probably done to raise the number of possible PsExec
requests the machine could make so the ransomware may spread:
reg add
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
/v MaxMpxCt /d 65535 /t REG_DWORD /f
Then, it deletes the shadow copies from the infected machine using both “vssadmin” and “wmic”:
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
wmic shaodwcopy delete

BlackCat Execution as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform
BlackCat enumerates all local disk partitions on the infected machine, and any hidden partition
that is found is mounted in order to make it possible to encrypt more files.
The ransomware also attempts to propagate through the network via the use of the “net use”
command and PsExec which is embedded inside the BlackCat executable. The ransomware
executes the tools using credentials that are configured in the ransomware config:

Credentials in the configuration
Additionally, BlackCat disables windows’ automatic repair and clears the machine's event log, by
running the following commands:
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No
cmd.exe /c for /F \"tokens=*\" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl \"%1\"

5/17

In order to maximize the number of encrypted files, BlackCat attempts to kill several processes
and services on the machine in order to decrease the number of locked files that are not
accessible due to another program (full list in appendix). In addition, BlackCat’s configuration
includes a list of directories to be excluded from encryption. (see appendix):

BlackCat Configuration
To encrypt the files, BlackCat may use AES or ChaCha20 for encryption, based on the
configuration. It drops a ransom note titled : “RECOVER-[encrypted file extension]- FILES.txt” in
each folder and in the end, the ransomware changes the desktops wallpaper:

Linux variant specific commands
The Linux variant was observed executing commands in order to delete VMware ESXi snapshots.
The ransomware generates a list of running virtual machines:
esxcli --formatter=csv --format-param=fields=="WorldID,DisplayName" vm process list
Each virtual machine is then terminates using the command:
awk -F "\"*,\"*" '{system("esxcli vm process kill --type=force --world-id="$1)}'
Finally all snapshots of the virtual machines are deleted:
for i in `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms| awk '{print$1}'`;do vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall $i
& done

BlackCat and LockBit Connection
The Nocturnus team observed interesting overlaps between tools and infrastructure used by
BlackCat ransomware and LockBit ransomware. The Nocturnus team analyzed a .NET written
launcher named “setup.exe” that is used to download and execute BlackCat ransomware.
The launcher contains the following PDB path:
“D:\my\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\setup\obj\Release\setup.pdb”.
When searching for files that share the PDB, we encountered several additional malware with the
same name that have remarkable similarities to the BlackCat launcher. When examining the code
and Infrastructure of these malware, we see overlaps between BlackCat infrastructure and LockBit
infrastructure.
BlackCat Launcher

The launcher downloads the BlackCat executable from the C2 and executes it using the “-access-token” argument, which is required in order to run BlackCat:

BlackCat Launcher code
Additionally, the tool collects basic profiling information about the infected machine and uploads it
to the C2. The information collected is:
A screen capture
Username
OS name
OS language
Timezone
Windows UUID
Keyboard language
Installed users
Installed software
Drives
LockBit Profiler Tool
The Nocturnus team discovered striking similarities with the BlackCat launcher and a profiler
associated with LockBit ransomware. The profiler variants which are linked to LockBit use almost
the same code as the BlackCat launcher, except for slight variations.

8/17

The only difference in functionality is that they do not attempt to download anything, they only
collect profiling data, with the difference being that instead of collecting the machine’s “Windows
UUID”, the profiler checks if LockBit is already installed on the machine:

Left: LockBit profiler code Right: BlackCat Launcher code
When checking the Infrastructure used by these tools, we see connections and similarities in the
IP addresses, URI structure, and file names:

9/17

BlackCat and LockBot infrastructure comparison
All the IP addresses that are used by the BlackCat launcher and LockBit profiler, share the URI
paths “files” and “upload”. In addition, BlackCat and LockBit samples sometimes share file
names. For example, we observed BlackCat samples with the name:
“test_4mmc_x86_32_windows_encrypt_app.exe” and LockBit samples with the name
“4mmc.exe”
Another example of shared file names is a LockBit sample named “screensaver.exe”, which is
also the default name used for the BlackCat executable that is downloaded using the launcher:

“Screensaver.exe” used in BlackCat Launcher
This connection between some of the tools and infrastructure between BlackCat ransomware and
LockBit ransomware might indicate sharing of code and tools between cybercriminals, or there
could be individuals that worked for both ransomware operators:

CYBEREASON DETECTION AND PREVENTION
The Cybereason XDR Platform is able to prevent the execution of the BlackCat Ransomware
using multi-layer protection that detects and blocks malware with threat intelligence, machine
learning, and next-gen antivirus (NGAV) capabilities.
Additionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled, behavioral detection techniques in the
platform are able to detect and prevent any attempt to encrypt files and generates a MalOp for it:
