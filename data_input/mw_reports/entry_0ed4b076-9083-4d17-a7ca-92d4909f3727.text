Two loosely related cybercrime groups operating scores of fake ad agencies from China are
so deeply embedded in the ad tech industry that they can launch attacks that surpass the
scale of the largest advertisers. At a time when China is under intense international scrutiny,
these groups largely fly under the radar, raking in millions of victims in Europe and the US
without drawing attention to their source.
In this article, we present eGobbler and their doppelganger Nephos7, their origins and what
made them successful over time.

Setting the stage — Rise to success, 2017–2018

1/16

The infamous Amazon gift card scam (eGobbler, iOS, July 2018)
eGobbler rose to success by being one of the first groups to leverage javascript
fingerprinting to target iOS. iOS being the least fragmented mobile environment, they
understood that they could build very precise fingerprints for it, that would allow them to
evade simulated environments as found in the security scanners of that time. Starting with
JavaScript Sensor APIs and quickly moving to WebGL based fingerprinting, they essentially
defeated user agent spoofing and gained unfettered Javascript execution on millions of endusers’ devices since then.

Stable scheme, with some twists
Since 2018, eGobbler has settled on a relatively sophisticated but slow evolving stack:

2/16

Leverage ad platforms’ hosting to embed malicious code in HTML5 ad code. This is
typically achieved by injecting the code in or dependencies — libraries commonly found
in HTML5 ads.
Use of WebGL-based fingerprinting (among other tricks) to activate on victims’ devices
only
Geo-fencing, using basic server-side cloaking
One-time use of commercial CDNs as reverse proxies (namely Rackspace and Fastly)
Programmatic ad chains are typically made of an SSP call, a DSP call and optionally
an adserver call. eGobbler is adept at creating artifical chains of ad tag redirections
between multiple DSPs, which would never exist in the wild. The goal is likely to
confuse analysts on the actual source of the ad.
Through 2019, eGobbler slowly migrated to weekend activity. By 2020, they ended up
exclusively running on weekends (and holidays) to maximize impact during off hours.
Considering eGobbler’s massive scale, this change of tactic alone is the main driver for
the rise in general malvertising weekend activity since 2019
Breaking the browsers
Top malvertising groups see increased browser security around forced redirects as a threat
and invest in finding flaws. To boost the efficacy of their payloads, eGobbler came up with a
number of zero day exploits.
Detected by Confiant in 2019, CVE-2019–8771 and CVE-2019–5840 are browser
vulnerabilities (Safari and Chrome) introduced by eGobbler and allowing them to bypass
popup blocking and iframe sandboxing, which are protections against forced redirects (more
here and here).

Enter Nephos7
Nephos7 started out in Q4 of 2019 with familiar tactics and techniques:
Use of commercial ad servers to hide malicious code
Use of commercial CDNs as reverse proxies (Cloudfront)
Mimick instantiation of popular JavaScript APIs (e.g. Hotjar, Snowplow, etc.) to hide in
plain sight
Use of WebGL-based fingerprinting (among other tricks) to activate on victims’ devices
only
By end-of-year 2019, Nephos7 had aligned with eGobbler’s weekend patterns with a
large attack on December 29.

Timeline of tactics and payloads
From Gift Card Scam to Carrier-branded Scams to Drive-by downloads, Nephos7 tightly
follows eGobbler’s path across all dimensions.

Not only the types of payloads align very closely but the landing pages bear a striking
resemblance. As an illustration, below is a comparison of carrier-branded “CC-Submit”
scams where the victim is presented with a fake message from their ISP (or mobile phone
carrier) inviting them to enter their credit card information to confirm their prize.

CC-Submit payloads in France and the UK, eGobbler, July 25 2020
From June 2020, both attackers switched focus to the United States and introduced drive-by
download payloads. Below is a comparison of landing pages pushed by each threat actor in
the US: Almost the same, dropping the same adware (different hashes), no overlap in
infrastructure. Nephos7 wins with its “Premier Software Updater” ™.

Both of these .msi files unpack and run the same variant of a signed installer we dubbed
Holcus Installer. The Holcus Installer samples we collected so far were all signed, and some
of their features include:
C2 communications via https, with certificate pinning checks. For example checks are
performed on the certificate issuer string if it contains a substring , , or before a
communication is established.
All Holcus Installer strings hinting to main functionality, C2 server, and executed
commands are all encrypted with a custom RC4-like algorithm using key
Holcus Installer checks if PUA detection (PuaProtection field) is enabled in the current
Windows Defender configuration. This is done by via the wmi query:
One variant of Holcus Installer we found, additionally checks the DeviceID of the
keyboard retreived via wmi query:
Holcus Installer has the capability to download and execute binaries from the C2 server
and sends hardcoded status messages to the C2 server by encoding them using a
bin2hex encoding.
Holcus Installer variants we collected have been observed communicating with the
following C&C servers:
Holcus Installer uses a hardcoded User-Agent “” for C2 communications
In our test environment, Holcus Installer was seen downloading and installing a decoy

Explaining the striking resemblance
We think that the two groups are solely focused on redirecting visitors to malicious “offers”
that are operated by different groups, themselves specialized in operating these schemes.
Malvertisers can shop around with different affiliate marketers to get the best yield for their
traffic. Somehow Nephos7 and eGobbler are shopping around at the same stores.

2020’s Largest Digital Marketers

6/16

Monthly activity by actor in 2020 (by number of malicious ads served)
Both actors maintained presence through 2020, with Nephos7 being wildly successful in the
first half of the year in Europe, while eGobbler maintained a steady pace and more
successfully transitioned to targeting the US in the second half of the year.

Volumes by month by country (Top 6 countries only)
In 2020, both actors achieved “web scale” on multiple occasions. No other malvertising
group was (ever?) able to create anything comparable to this massive ecosystem disruption.
Here are two examples:

7/16

Peak activity in % of display advertising (source: Confiant)
Clocking at 5% of all display advertising on May 24th, Nephos7 arguably became
(for an instant) the largest digital marketer in Europe. In comparison, eGobbler’s
most significant spike “only” hit 2.3% on July 25th.
In total, in 2020, Confiant blocked 112 million ads from eGobbler and 198 million ads from
Nephos7 on behalf of our online publisher clients. Extrapolating our data, we estimate 6
billion malicious ads were served by the two actors during the period.

Targeting
Device/OS targeting has been markedly different between the two actors. In 2020, eGobbler
was heavily focused on targeting desktop computers (76%) while Nephos7 was more evenly
split between mobile devices (52%) and desktop (48%).
As presented earlier, Nephos7 specifically targets Windows, excluding Mac OS X from its
targeting.
Notably, in 2020 iOS only received a small fraction of hits from eGobbler (1.8%) while being
completely excluded by Nephos7. Both actors have favored Android as their mobile platform
of choice. This is all the more striking as eGobbler started out back in 2017 with a strong iOS
focus.

8/16

Device/OS targeting by actor (2020)
To achieve the sort of persistent scale that both actors enjoyed in 2020, they became experts
at building relationships with “DSP” ad platforms. To enter the ad tech ecosystem, they
worked to look reputable from all perspectives. That includes:
Building a reputable looking corporate identity, with a legal entity registered far from
“home” - more on this below.
Using a commercial ad server to host ad creatives and give a semblance of buyer
sophistication. In reality, well-tuned commercial ad servers can achieve incredibly
powerful cloaking for malvertisers.
Running dummy ad campaigns for weeks or months at low volumes (to build
reputation) before flipping the switch.

Hunting Corporations
Programmatic advertising has been architectured such that online publishers have little
oversight or visibility on campaigns that are running on their sites. What will start running at
full throttle at 8 am on a quiet Sunday morning (eGobbler’s and Nephos7’s favorite modus
operandi) is left to sheer unpredictability.
The situation is quite different if you take the perspective of a DSP. To qualify for the kind of
scale that these threat actors are craving for, customers typically go through a thorough
approval process, mostly focused on assessing risk based on reputation.

Burn and Repeat
Once they’ve committed their deed, the abused DSP forever bans the offending entity used
to finance the malicious ad campaign. This constraint shapes for our attackers a fairly simple
game plan:
Create many legal entities,
Burn them one by one with each DSP
Repeat.

9/16

Due to the lack of industry-wide buyer transparency, malicious entities have the leisure to
strike repeatedly without fear of industry-wide ban. We at Confiant sponsor an initiative to
provide this transparency: .

Network of Organized Crime
Over time, Confiant’s security team started to methodically pin attacks to their corresponding
legal entities. This effort could not have been possible without the cooperation of many
impacted DSPs (thank you!).

Nephos7 Entities

Nephos7 entities active in 2020
We believe Wooden Ads started operating some time in Q4 of 2019 as the first Nephos7
front company making the rounds through the major DSPs. With an incorporation in
November 2017, one can only wonder what this company was previously used for. The level
of sophistication we’ve identified right from its inception is consistent with a previous life in
malvertising.
Despite a remarkable streak of Wooden Ads activity, it soon became time to invoke more
legal entities to establish more DSP connections. By June, Nephos7 started rolling out a
wide range of entities that had been patiently staged since 2018. Incorporated in Colorado in
March and October 2018 respectively, AdSige and SignalAds both appeared on our radar
in June 2020 in separate attacks. In total, between June and November, 8 entities were
responsible for Nephos7 attacks. Paradoxically, this is also a time of decreased success,
characterized by an inability to generate any significant volumes after July.

While looking up the directors of Nephos7 entities (all individuals residing in China), we
identified many more dormant companies based in the UK, also established in 2018 and in
good standing as of late 2020, likely ready for a slew of new attacks.

Confiant has been tracking eGobbler since 2017 but only started building consistent entity
attribution in 2020. We know however that eGobbler started out by registering legal entities
in Hong Kong and over time realized that registering in the US would carry more reputation
and facilitate building business relationships with DSPs. Two entities were created in August
2019 and another two in March 2020, all with Chinese-named directors.

Articles of Incorporation

eGobbler leveraged the services of a CPA firm located in California and specialized in
assisting Chinese entrepreneurs build a presence in the US.
We were also able to expand our visibility on eGobbler entities with basic OSINT, pivoting on
fake business personas and identifying other ad companies with similar profiles:

Wrapping up
We believe we’ve achieved a significant level of visibility in both eGobbler’s and Nephos7’s
infrastructure. By disclosing our findings, we are hoping to ⑴ wipe out a good amount of
their infrastructure in a single blow and ⑵ educate on these threats and how to defend
against them.
One burning question remains: Are Nephos7 and eGobbler two divisions of the same group?
Are they competitors? Having collected hundreds of IOCs on both actors, we can confidently
say that both infrastructures are completely separated and do not overlap. However, the
modes of operation and evolution of tactics are strikingly aligned in unique ways, suggesting
that the two Chinese groups are probably aware of each other and tracking each other’s
iterations.
