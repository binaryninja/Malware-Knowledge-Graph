Remote Access Tools (RATs) are software that allow users to gain access to their computer
system remotely from another location. Some key features with these tools include file
sharing, cloud storage, video/text chat capabilities, etc. Although it can be deemed genuine
for a commercial user, threat actors can utilize these systems to carry out malicious attacks
and steal data. In this report, the following commonly exploited remote access tools used by
malicious actors will be focused on: RemotePC, Ultraviewer, MSP360, PDQDeploy, and
ZohoAssist.

1/8

RemotePC
RemotePC is a free commercial tool created by iDrive Inc. that allows users to remotely
access and control their Windows, Mac, or Linux computers from other devices. Features
with the software include messaging tools, file transfer and multiple monitor support.
Currently there have been confidential reports stating its relevance and usage in threat actor
breaches.
Vulnerability Reports/CVE
The most recent vulnerability reports on RemotePC were taken in July of 2022 (CVE-2021–
34688 and CVE-2021–34687)[7]. Previous versions allowed for several security threats such
as denial of service, authentication bypasses, privilege escalation, information disclosure and
man-in-the-middle attacks.

Ultraviewer
Ultraviewer, signed by DucFabulous Co., Ltd, is a tool with various capabilities including
support on all versions of Windows, chat boxes and remote file sharing.
One of the latest occurrences of a threat actor utilizing Ultraviewer is its feature detected by
AT&T Alien Labs in a remote access trojan called ‘FatalRAT’[1]. The malware allowed for
attackers to run tests that checked for virtual machines within the system before executing
commands to infect the system remotely. A key factor of this malware was that it actively
uninstalled Ultraviewer and installed AnyDesk. Under suspected circumstances, the malware
will spread on the victim’s network by brute-forcing weak passwords through IPC$. If
successful, the malware copies itself to the dedicated folder as %Folder%\hackshen.exe and
will execute the copied file remotely.
Another usage of UltraViewer was as a tool in an exam hacking scheme, Delhi Police
arrested three Russian hackers who were hired to supply answers for various reputable
exams (e.g. GMAT, IBM, CCISO, etc.)[2]. The hackers claimed to have helped hundreds of
candidates and have been ongoing since 2019. On exam day, the hackers would send a link
to the ‘Ultraviewer’ software for their clients to download. From there, the clients would use
Ultraviewer to grant access to the hacker who inputs the correct answers to the test.

PDQ Deploy
PDQ Deploy is a software tool that allows users to create custom deployment packages.
Essentially, users can install software remotely on any system.
PDQ Deploy used by threat actors:
A Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) software by the name of Avos Locker utilized multiple
remote access tools to carry out attacks and exploit vulnerabilities. The attackers were
utilizing the safe mode configuration to disable most Windows third party drivers and
endpoint security software[3]. Thus Avos Locker attackers were rebooting the machines into
Safe Mode and running the IT management tool AnyDesk. The attackers also leverage PDQ
Deploy to push out batch scripts to their targeted machines. This in return would carry out
their attack in deploying the Avos Locker ransomware.

ZohoAssist
ZohoAssist is a remote access tool that emphasizes initiating and scheduling remote support
sessions and troubleshoot issues via the web browser.
ZohoAssist used by threat actors:
Luna Moth Phishing Attack (July 12th, 2022)

6/8

The Luna Moth ransom group, also named Silent Ransom Group, have carried out a
phishing scam using commercial remote access tools such as Atera, Anydesk, Syncro and
Splashtop. The group was recognized by the Incident Response team at Sygnia . Luna
Moth’s tactic included luring victims with false subscriptions for Zoho Masterclass or
Duolingo.[4] The victim is initially sent a counterfeit invoice to renew a subscription for
selected services that were not originally purchased. When prompted to dispute the charge
or cancel the subscription, the victim would contact customer service which would be one of
the threat actors via phone. The threat actor would then provide instructions to install remote
access tools on the victim’s system. Further after receiving access, the threat actor would
install other tools such as Rclone, SharpShares and SoftPerfect network Scanner to steal
user data.
Zoho ManageEngine Vulnerability Incident (February 16, 2022)
Threat actor that goes by the name, ”unindicted”, exploited a Zoho ManageEngine
vulnerability that allowed them to execute code. Without authentication to the International
Committee of the Red Cross network.[5] The vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021–40539
allowed the actor to execute privilege escalation and exfiltrate registry hives and active
directory files through web shells.
