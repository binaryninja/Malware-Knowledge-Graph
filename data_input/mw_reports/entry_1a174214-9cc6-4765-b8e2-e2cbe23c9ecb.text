BACKGROUND ON RIG EXPLOIT KIT:
Rig-V is what security researchers called Rig EK version 4 when it was only accessible
by "VIP" customers, while the old version (Rig 3) was still in use (reference).
I currently call it "Rig-V" out of habit. You can probably just call it Rig EK now.
Before 2017, I used to see Empire Pack (Rig-E) which is a variant of Rig EK with olderstyle URLs as described by Kafeine here.
I haven't seen anything other than Rig-V (Rig 4.0) when looking at Rig EK-based
campaigns so far in 2017.
BACKGROUND ON THE EITEST CAMPAIGN:
My most recent write-up on the EITest campaign can be found here.
BACKGROUND ON SPORA RANSOMWARE:
Spora ransomware was first spotted last week and reported on 2017-01-10 at
BleepingComputer (link) and other sites quickly picked up on the news.
Apparently, it was being spread through malicious spam (malspam) last week.
1/7

Now it's also being spread through Rig Exploit Kit by the EITest campaign.
Of note, there is no callback traffic by the Spora ransomware.
The only post-infection I saw was HTTPS traffic to spora.bz when I followed the link
from the decryption instructions.

Shown above: Flowchart for this infection traffic.

TRAFFIC

Shown above: Injected script from the EITest campaign from the compromised site.
