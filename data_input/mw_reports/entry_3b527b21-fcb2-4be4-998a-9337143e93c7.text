Having last looked at the MoqHao (or Roaming Mantis) malware family in January 2021, we
decided to take another look at the activities of this threat group. MoqHao targets Android
users, usually via an initial attack vector of phishing SMS messages, with a particular focus
on Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (although MoqHao’s focus continues to expand).
Several researchers are actively tracking MoqHao’s phishing infrastructure, with IOCs posted
daily on forums such as Twitter. For example:
@KesaGataMe0
@NaomiSuzuki
@ninoseki
@papa_anniekey

These researchers do a great job of identifying the latest campaigns, and this blog will not
seek to duplicate their findings. Instead, we will use Team Cymru’s internet telemetry data to
examine a subset of MoqHao campaigns, from the period April – June 2021, to provide
additional insight into their scale and regularity.
This blog will be the first in a series which looks at various elements of the MoqHao infrastructure,
beginning first with users targeted in Japan.
Duck DNS

MoqHao commonly uses domains generated through the dynamic DNS service Duck DNS
for its first-stage delivery infrastructure. The hosting IP addresses for these domains appear
to be limited to MoqHao whilst campaigns are active, shared hosting is rarely observed.
The domains utilized are generally a mix of randomly generated strings, with some spoofing
of related entities. For example, amongst the domains used in this research were a number
that spoofed NTT Docomo, a Japanese mobile phone operator. A regular expression can be
used for matching on these domains:
[a-z]{10}.duckdns.org – e.g., docomoawbr.duckdns.org
The domain and hosting IP address pairs used in this research are shared on our public
GitHub.
Network Telemetry

A set of hosting IP addresses, assigned to three providers, were used as the seeds for this
analysis:
HDTIDC Limited – South Korea
Ophidian Network Limited – Ukraine
Zenlayer Inc – United States
All the IP addresses were identified within Team Cymru’s internal Passive DNS data sets and
were observed hosting first-stage domains of the format described above. The IPs appear to
be active for several days (on average around 14 days) hosting multiple domains, which
update on a much more frequent basis. Therefore, blocklists based on individual domain
names are not an effective countermeasure to this threat.
The table below provides a summary of the hosting IP addresses, including details on when
they were first reported in open source, when victim traffic first appeared within Team
Cymru’s data holdings and the total number of victim connections observed.

Table 1: MoqHao Distribution Infrastructure Summary
As can be seen, there is generally a close proximity between distribution servers becoming
active (receiving victim communications) and them being reported on Twitter – usually one
day or less.
HDTIDC LIMITED, KR

To account for differences in our coverage between the three providers used for first-stage
domain hosting, we focused further on the six IP addresses within 103.80.134.0/24 assigned
to HDTIDC Limited.
Comment: With all things being equal in terms of the (inferred) destination of the traffic
analysed, we can discern more accurate patterns in the data.
Looking at inbound connections on TCP/80 sourced from IP addresses assigned to
Japanese broadband/telecoms providers, we can see a daily average of around 200-300
potential victim connections to the distribution servers. On 29 April a spike in activity was
noted, lasting for around 10 days – coinciding with the beginning of the Golden Week holiday
period in Japan.
It is possible that the actors behind MoqHao increased their phishing activities to coincide
with this period and thus generated more victims.

The figure below shows daily connections to the distribution IP addresses in combination
with when each of these was seen active (outside of these periods of activity there were zero
connections observed).

Figure 2: Daily Connections to MoqHao IPs
When we looked more specifically at where these potential victims were located, based on
geolocation data, we found communications emanating from across Japan with large
clusters focused on the main population centres.
The following figures provide a snapshot of victim locations, at a high level, during the period
of analysis – clustered around Tokyo, Kyoto/Osaka/Nagoya and Fukuoka.
Specific details of victim communications have been shared with JPCERT through our
outreach team.

Conclusion

In this first blog, we have looked at some high-level details of a subset of recent MoqHao
campaigns, providing an insight into the consistent nature of the threat actors activities – with
victims connecting to distribution servers throughout the analysis period. We have
established a minimum number of around 200-300 victim connections per day, based on our
coverage of six distribution servers assigned to HDTIDC Limited in South Korea.
We have also hopefully brought to your attention several trustworthy commentators to follow
for daily updates on MoqHao indicators.
In future blogs on this subject, we will continue to track the broad trends surrounding
MoqHao, as well as diving deeper into the various stages on the malware’s network
infrastructure.
