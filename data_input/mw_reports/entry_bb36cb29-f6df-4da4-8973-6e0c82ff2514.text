Silence group targeting Russian Banks via Malicious
CHM
reaqta.com/2019/01/silence-group-targeting-russian-banks/

In November 2018 we followed up on a tweet mentioning a potential malicious code
disseminated in CHM (Microsoft Compiled HTML Help). A preliminary analysis caught the
attention of our Threat Analysis and Intelligence team as it yielded interesting data that,
among other things, shows that the attack campaign was targeting employees from financial
entities, specifically in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. We conclude that
the actor behind the attack is Silence group, a relatively new threat actor that’s been
operating since mid-2016. The list of targeted entities we’ve identified so far includes:
NBD Bank Russia: Russian bank offering retail and commercial services.
Zapsibkombank (Zapadno-Sibirskiy Kommercheskiy Bank): West Siberian
Commercial Bank (WSCB). Russia.
FPB (Finprombank): Russia.
MSP Bank (МСП Банк): Russian Federation State Bank, focuses on providing
financing to small and medium enterprises.
MT Bank (МТБанк): Meridian trade Bank, the only Belarus-based bank entity in the
focus of this threat.

Map of targeted entities
The main vector is represented by a malicious CHM file. Despite being an “obsolete” format,
CHM has been effectively used in the past to run malicious code. In this case it is used to
download components that are part of the infection chain, in addition to running native OS
binaries to collect information related to its targets.

Silence Group Dissemination Strategy
The attack begins with the dissemination of spear-phishing emails in russian language, with
a compressed attachment called “Contract_12112018.Z” (Contract November 12, 2018).
The uncompressed file is called “Contract_12112018.chm” and its content is related to a
Resolution to Open Bank Accounts, its execution represents the first step of the infection
process.

Spear-phishing attachment the CHM malicious file and “Contract_12112018.chm” file content
The spear-phishing were sent from (spoofed) official addresses belonging to different
Russian banking entities, in our case the majority belonged to the Central Bank of the
Russian Federation, and the email content was related to alleged regulations “On unifying
the format of electronic banking messages of the Bank of Russia“.
The email shown above translates to:
“Good day!
I, Skurtov Andrei Vladimirovich,
Head of Interbank Operations and
Correspondent Relations of PJSC “FinServisBank”.
We negotiated the opening and maintenance of correspondent accounts in rubles and freely
convertible currencies.
I ask you to consider the application as soon as possible to open and maintain accounts.
I attach the archive with the contract. Please fill it in and send it to me.
Thank you in advance, waiting for an answer.
Respectfully,
Head of Interbank Operations and
Correspondent Relations of PJSC “FinserviceBank”
Nizhny Novgorod region, Sarov, Silkin street, 13”

Malicious components
In the following graph we have reconstructed the complete CHM infection chain used by
Silence group, divided in three main stages:
1. Download of the initial payload (VBScript) necessary to start the infection chain.

2. Activities performed by the initial payload on the infected computer, and download of
the main malware component.
3. Information gathering and delivering to C&C.

CHM infection chain
The Compiled HTML Help file (contract_12112018.chm), whose file structure is similar to that
of a hypertext page, is opened through the native Microsoft Windows program “hh.exe”. The
CHM file contains a HTM file called “start.htm“ that runs once the file is opened
and contains the malicious payload, used to start cmd.exe and mshta.exe to download a
malicious VBscript (called “li”) from the IP 146.0.72.139. This is the first stage of the infection
chain.
The following image shows in detail the command line used to start mshta which downloads
and runs the malicious VBS file:

Content of the HTM file embedded in the malicious CHM file
The second stage of the infection chain continues with the execution of the instructions
contained in the “li” file, which is basically responsible for:
Making a copy of cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe, renaming them to ejpejpff.com and
ejpejpf.com respectively, and saving them in %TEMP% folder.
Invoking ejpejpf.com (which is a copy of Powershell.exe) with the parameters -nop -W
hidden -noninteractive -c to:
download the “flk” payload, encoded in Base64, and save it to the %TEMP%
folder as “ejpejp.txt“,
decode and save it as “ejpejp.com”
execute “ejpejp.com”

Content of the li file
The third and last stage of the infection chain continues with the execution
of “ejpejp.com”, responsible for:
Duplicating itself in \AppData\Roaming\ as conhost.exe, the same filename typically
used by the legitimate “Console Windows Host”, probably for evasion

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run as a
persistence method
Running System Information Discovery
The metadata description of the malicious file is “MS DefenderApplicationController”.
We have identified this application as a variant of the trojan used by the Silence group that
is responsible for gathering information about each victim’s computer, collected by running
four Windows system binaries:
system.exe: “System Information” is executed to collect detailed information about the
victim’s computer configuration and the operating system’s details, such as: product ID,
hardware features and security information.
net.exe: “Net View” is used to collect information about the local area network and to
start/stop the IPv6 protocol service.
whoami.exe: Used to obtain the user’s current domain and username
ipconfig.exe: Used to collect TCP / IP network configuration settings.
All this information is stored in the file “INFOCONTENT.TXT“, saved in %ProgramData% and
uploaded to the server hosted at the IP 146.0.72.188 that is Silence group’s Command and
Control (C2) for this threat. Below is the storyline of the attack reconstructed using ReaQtaHive.

Network Infrastructure
As shown above, the threat runs several native binaries to collect useful information for its
recon phase. That is, these data are processed by Silence group to produce intelligence
about the infrastructure of the targeted banking entities.
The communication process is carried out using two IP addresses. The first one is
146.0.72.139 which is the direct channel for downloading different parts of the attack chain.
The second one communicates with the command and control by using the IP address
146.0.72.188 to exfiltrate the information collected. Both IPs are hosted in Netherlands.

Attribution
As usual attribution is never easy and we would like to share the elements that lead us to
think Silence group is behind this attack:
The modus operandi and the infection vector (CHM) is a typical trait of Silence’s latest
operations
The inner structure of CHM is common to previous attacks from Silence group
Downloaded binaries match with those used by Silence (a variant of Truebot)
Language used in the spear-phishing campaign is a match
Targets are located in Eastern Europe and Russia

7/9

Type of targets (financial institutions) match with the targets usually chosen by Silence
group
The TTPs identified in previous attacks from Silence group are a match with the attack
analysed here
These elements led us to the conclusion that, with high likelihood, Silence (or an affiliated
group) is behind these attacks.

Conclusion
The intelligence we have collected shows that this attack is part of a more extensive
operation, still focused on financial institutions operating mainly on Russian territory. The
infection process, attack chain and the way the operation is structured, shows that Silence
group, though still young, is an increasingly more organized and dangerous banking malware
distribution entity.
Our analysis has been conducted using ReaQta-Hive: endpoint visibility and threat hunting
capabilities are a requirement for every organization that aims at mitigating the risk of cyber
attacks. Such threats show how fast and adaptable attackers are and that a structured
process to detect, contain and respond is essential to prevent damages and interruption to
business continuity.
