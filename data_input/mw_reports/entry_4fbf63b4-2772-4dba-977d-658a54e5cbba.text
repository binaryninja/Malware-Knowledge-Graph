Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Summary
TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is a computer chip (microcontroller) that can securely
store artifacts used to authenticate the platform (your PC or laptop). These artifacts can
include passwords, certificates, or encryption keys. A TPM can also be used to store
platform measurements that help ensure that the platform remains trustworthy.
Authentication (ensuring that the platform can prove that it is what it claims to be) and
attestation (a process helping to prove that a platform is trustworthy and has not been
breached) are necessary steps to ensure safer computing in all environments.
Trusted modules can be used in computing devices other than PCs, such as mobile
phones or network equipment.

The nature of hardware-based cryptography ensures that the information stored in
hardware is better protected from external software attacks. A variety of applications
storing secrets on a TPM can be developed. These applications make it much harder to
access information on computing devices without proper authorization (e.g., if the device
was stolen). If the configuration of the platform has changed as a result of unauthorized

activities, access to data and secrets can be denied and sealed off using these
applications.
However, it is important to understand that TPM cannot control the software that is
running on a PC. TPM can store pre-run time configuration parameters, but it is other
applications that determine and implement policies associated with this information.
Processes that need to secure secrets, such as digital signing, can be made more
secure with a TPM. And mission critical applications requiring greater security, such as
secure email or secure document management, can offer a greater level of protection
when using a TPM. For example, if at boot time it is determined that a PC is not
trustworthy because of unexpected changes in configuration, access to highly secure
applications can be blocked until the issue is remedied (if a policy has been set up that
requires such action). With a TPM, one can be more certain that artifacts necessary to
sign secure email messages have not been affected by software attacks. And, with the
use of remote attestation, other platforms in the trusted network can make a
determination, to which extent they can trust information from another PC. Attestation or
any other TPM functions do not transmit personal information of the user of the platform.
These capabilities can improve security in many areas of computing, including ecommerce, citizen-to-government applications, online banking, confidential government
communications and many other fields where greater security is required. Hardwarebased security can improve protection for VPN, wireless networks, file encryption (as in
Microsoft’s BitLocker) and password/PIN/credentials’ management. TPM specification is
OS-agnostic, and software stacks exist for several Operating Systems.
TPMs (current version is 1.2) use the following cryptographic algorithms: RSA, SHA1,
and HMAC..
The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) is an international de facto standards body of
approximately 140 companies engaged in creating specifications that define PC TPMs,
trusted modules for other devices, trusted infrastructure requirements, APIs and
protocols necessary to operate a trusted environment. After specifications are completed,
they are released to the technology community and can be downloaded from the TCG
Web Site.
Without standard security procedures and shared specifications, it is not possible for
components of the trusted environment to interoperate, and trusted computing
applications cannot be implemented to work on all platforms. A proprietary solution
cannot ensure global interoperability and is not capable of providing a comparable level
of assurance due to more limited access to cryptographic and security expertise and
reduced availability for a rigorous review process. From the point of view of cryptography,
for interoperability with the other elements of the platform, other platforms, and
infrastructure, it is necessary for trusted modules to be able to use the same
cryptographic algorithms, Although standard published algorithms may have
weaknesses, these algorithms are thoroughly tested and are gradually replaced or
improved when vulnerabilities are discovered. This is not true in the case of proprietary
algorithms.
According to market research reports, over 100 million branded PCs and laptops with
TPMs were sold in 2007. Server produces are beginning to ship, and a variety of

applications based on TPM, such as secure email or file encryption, have been
implemented using TCG specifications. Trusted Network Connect (TNC) products that
use TCG principles to enhance the security of communications are shipping, too. Draft
specifications for storage (for hard drives) and mobile trusted modules (for mobile
telephones) have been released.
