Introduction

The group behind PYSA ransomware has earned notoriety for targeting government
agencies, educational institutions, and the healthcare sector. The group is known to
carefully research high-value targets before launching its attacks, compromising enterprise
systems and forcing organizations to pay large ransoms to restore their data. They are listed
as one of the most advanced ransomware groups that carry out their operations off the radar.
The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team detected and gained visibility into PYSA’s ransomware
infrastructure and analyzed its findings to gain insight into how the criminal operation works.
This report contains some of the latest information on how this destructive cybercriminal
syndicate operates and provides security professionals with crucial insight into detecting
and mitigating the risk of attacks like PYSA’s. It also contains surprising information about the
sophistication of PYSA’s development cycle and its dedication to providing threat actors
with new features and functionalities.
PYSA is a ransomware variant related to the well-known Mespinoza ransomware. Threat
intelligence professionals widely believe that the same group of individuals are behind both
technologies. The PTI team has successfully gained visibility into many parts of the group’s
ransomware infrastructure, including its public leak server and its internal management
panel. These insights will help high-value government, education, and healthcare targets
protect their systems from attacks that rely on PYSA’s techniques and technologies.
We started investigating PYSA group around September 2020. Our analysis lasted for
16-months to identify every possible detail of the infrastructure used by the group. PYSA
servers were taken offline around Jan-Feb 2022. Reports made public by our PTI team go
through careful phases before the release. We are publishing this report only now to support
other critical sectors to prepare for similar attacks in the future and provide insight into the
methods used by the crime gang.
Please note that this report has two versions. The ”Private Release” is provided to
law enforcement agencies, applicable CERTS / CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A.
Threat Intel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the
”Public Release” is publicly disseminated for the purpose of advancing the global fight
against high-end threat actors and APTs.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Executive Summary

This report contains threat intelligence insight into how the cybercriminal syndicate
behind PYSA and Mespinoza operate. The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team has gathered
this data by detecting and investigating systems used by PYSA threat actors.
Despite a generally competent development approach, PYSA threat actors made
operational security mistakes that exposed some elements of their infrastructure to our
threat intelligence team. We capitalized on these mistakes to research the group and
publish highly sensitive data on their technologies and internal operations.
Both PYSA and Mespinoza first appeared in late 2019. PYSA appears to be the successor to
Mespinoza, and benefits from a professional development cycle that provides the group
with new functionalities on a regular basis. Our team has identified a five-stage cycle
showcasing PYSA activities starting from August 2020 :

18.09.2020

2021

Initial project development.
Amazon account creation.

Full-text search capabilities.
SMB Relays / Proxies.
Stream encryption/decryption.

Stage 1

08.08.2020
Initial commit for public leak site.
Primitive data handling.
External storage.

Stage 3

Stage 2

25.09.2020

Stage 4

First production-ready release.
Active development started.

Stage 5

13.01.2022
Last operator activity.
End of development.
Server termination.

Figure 1. Timeline of the PYSA’s activity.

This timeline shows that PYSA threat actors contributed to the development of its capabilities
periodically for nearly two years. Some of the group’s most interesting developments (like
full-text search capabilities) coincide with periods of high-intensity activity when the group
attacked up to 90 different victims per month. This data is shown in greater detail in the
following sections, which break down PYSA’s operations into its technical components and
offer behind-the-scenes insight into how the ransomware group structured its organization.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Technical Analysis

This section contains valuable information about the PYSA team’s technical capabilities,
including its public server and management system. The public leak server is responsible
for hosting the victim data PYSA releases when its demands are not met. The notorious
ransomware gang’s management system brings new details on group operations to light.
While the PTI team successfully gained visibility to many parts of PYSA’s infrastructure,
some elements of the group’s operational environment remain hidden. These are excellent
candidates for further research in the threat intelligence community. We encourage other
researchers to follow our tracks and discover more about PYSA’s inner workings. PRODAFT
maintains a CIN 1 program for TI companies to collaborate on complex cases. The details for
the program can be found on our webpage.

3.1

Public Leak Server

If PYSA victims refuse to comply with the group’s demands, the PYSA team publishes
confidential victim data on a public leak server (as shown in Figure 2). PYSA has deployed
several hidden onion services to host this content :
na47pldl5eoqxt42.onion
• wqmfzni2nvbbpk25.onion
• pysa2bitc5ldeyfak4seeruqymqs4sj5wt5qkcq7aoyg4h2acqieywad.onion

Git Repository Analysis

One of our investigation’s most important findings is a publicly available .git folder
managed by PYSA operators. This is an obvious operational security mistake that is
nonetheless common among cybercriminals. Our team found sufficient evidence to show
that this public folder is not an intentional decoy, but a genuine tool forgotten by a careless
PYSA team member.
Anyone can access the forgotten Git folder’s URL and extract the files that reside in the
repository to verify our findings. We encourage security researchers to use GitTools 2 or
similar software to access this folder and review the data. The PTI team was also able to
obtain the commit history associated with the author’s account. For the sake of simplicity,
we have arranged this data in Table 1.

Table 1. Excerpt of commit history extracted from the git repository.

Upon analysis, the PTI team identified the project author as dodo@mail.pcc. It’s clear
that this user invented an invalid domain name, which probably represents the hostname
assigned to the user’s computer. However, there is additional evidence that provides some
insight into internal PYSA operations.
For example, the time zone automatically changes from UTC+2 to UTC+1 between the 16th
of September and the 14th of November. This correlates to daylight savings time, which
suggests the author is based in a country that observes daylight savings.

Torify 3 allows users to run applications on Tor network without native support. As shown
in Figure 3, it plays a crucial role in PYSA’s management panel and public leak website
operations. While obviously convenient from a usability point of view, its use also carries
important operational security implications.

Figure 3. Torify usage in the deployment script.

3.1.2

De-anonymizing TOR Hidden Service

Tor hidden services operate behind the TOR network. They are only accessible through
their unique ”.onion” links. The architecture of the TOR network makes monitoring traffic and
identifying the IP addresses running hidden services on the TOR network almost impossible.
While the architecture of the TOR network represents a considerable challenge, we can
successfully identify these so-called hidden networks when threat actors make infrastructural
and operational security mistakes.
In the case of PYSA, our team successfully benefited from the ransomware group’s operational
security mistakes and identified its hidden service on the TOR network. The hidden service
correlates to a hosting provider (Snel.com B.V.) located in the Netherlands.
To detect ransomware activities and notify the relevant authorities, we have been actively
monitoring all related server migrations associated with PYSA assets since September 2020.
Their infrastructure includes hidden services, management panels, monitoring systems and a
development environment, all of which apparently reside in a single data center (Snel.com
B.V.). Table 2 shows the list of management servers identified by the PTI team.

Leak Management Interface

PYSA threat actors use a custom leak management system to quickly find confidential
documents in the files exfiltrated from victims’ internal networks. The system (as shown in
Figure 5) allows users to search for these files by extension, file name, and content.

Figure 5. Index page of the victim (project) management.

Since the beginning of our investigation, we observed numerous usability updates on PYSA’s
systems. This suggests that the group is supported by competent developers who apply
modern operational paradigms to the group’s development cycle.
This unexpected finding tells a different story about ransomware gangs than the one the
cybersecurity industry is used to. It suggests a professional environment with well-organized
division of responsibilities, rather than a loose network of semi-autonomous threat actors.

Development Activity

The PYSA team utilizes the Git 4 version control system to manage the management
panel development processes. Figure 6 shows that they developed the system continuously,
despite occasional interruptions.

Figure 6. Development activity of the threat actors.

Table 3 shows the commit history extracted from the git repository of the management
system. Closer inspection of the table shows the developer’s time zone and the date of the
project kickoff. The first commit occurred on September 25th, 2020, early in the morning on
US Central Time (UTC-6).
Time zone data from this table does not correlate with the data in Table 1. A possible
explanation for this might be that the development team includes more than one person,
with individuals in multiple time zones responsible for managing different parts of the project.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Source Code Analysis

The PYSA’s management system is written in PHP 7.3.12, using the Laravel framework. The
system uses the MariaDB database, Redis cache, and an Amazon Cloud environment, as
shown in Figure 7. Moreover, we determined that the developers were using PHPStorm as their
IDE after deep inspection of the Git repositories of the project. The app itself is apparently
set to the Australia/Sydney time zone.

Figure 7. Environment variables of the management panel.

The system includes several API endpoints to handle requests like public file download, SMB
explorer, full-text search interface, JSON feeds for tracking, auto-GIF generation, and more.
For the sake of simplicity, the table below shows a subset of the most relevant endpoints.

3.2.3

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Full-text Search Interface

Once PYSA team members encrypt a target system, they must intimidate the victim into
paying a ransom. Part of this process involves proving that the victim’s confidential data has
been compromised successfully. PYSA has developed its own full-text search engine that
extracts metadata and makes victim information easy to find and access.
An early version of the PYSA system only made file names and paths available. The version
in use at the time of our investigation also includes content-based full-text search, but
it is only available for administrators and has not yet been rolled out for the production
environment. Figure 8 shows the full-text search interface of the management system, along
with some pre-defined keywords.

Figure 8. Full-text search interface of the management system.

This innovative system makes it easier for a large-scale cybercriminal network to operate
efficiently. However, it also provides insight into the mindset and ultimate goals of ransomware
operators. Pre-defined keywords like ”government” show an obvious target categorization
scheme at play, while more specific terms like ”1040”, ”1099”, and ”401(k)” refer to United
States tax documents and plans.
Further research into the predefined keywords (as shown in Table 5) may help pinpoint
future targets and refine some of the assumptions cybersecurity professionals make about
cybercrime groups like PYSA. For example, it’s clear that the list provided below is an
extended version of the keyword list extracted from the PowerShell script PYSA used to
exfiltrate data from the victim’s device. [3]

Infrastructure

In order to scale their infrastructure, the PYSA team deploys and manages a number of
dockerized containers, including public leak servers, database, and management servers.
These containers are connected via internal networking on the same dedicated server. Figure

Since December 2021, they have been deploying new management servers in order to
address scalability issues. Under this system, each threat actor is assigned a different
management server. The team uses external work queues like Amazon Simple Queue Service
(SQS) to manage the workflow assigned to each individual. Simple deployment scripts (as
shown in Figure 10) have been observed, allowing threat actors to deploy new management
panels instantly.

Encrypted Cloud Storage

It is surprising that the PYSA team utilized Amazon S3 cloud infrastructure to store their
encrypted files. The group’s Amazon account was created on 18.09.2020 and the bucket
dates to 21.09.2020. This bucket contains 31.47TB of encrypted data belonging to victims.
The system performs stream encryption and decryption services on the Amazon S3 cloud
whenever someone requests a file belonging to a victim. This request is made through a
hidden onion server using a FileVault package as shown in Figure 11.

Auto-GIF Generation

After ransom negotiations finish, many victims request proof of file deletion. PYSA can
automatically generate a GIF animation file (as shown in Figure 12) that appears to show the
stolen file paths being deleted. Once the ransom is paid, PYSA threat actors generate this
animation and send it to victims along with the decryption software.

Figure 12. Auto-GIF generator to reassure the victim.

Despite the obvious reassurance this GIF offers to victims, it is an illusion. The PYSA team
cannot delete the stolen files as shown in the animation. The PYSA team is free to use and
reuse victim’s data as often as it feels necessary, and can even retarget victims using the
data it claims to have deleted. This is important because PYSA is known to use double
extortion tactics against victims.

Data Exfiltration via SMB Links

In order to exfiltrate victim data from internal networks, the PYSA team uses SMB Links in
their system. While most links are proxy or relay servers, some point directly to the victim’s
infrastructure.
Upon filling the expected inputs as shown in Figure 13, the system executes asynchronous
tasks to pull files from the link using the SMB protocol. The project ID field represents the
victim’s unique ID, which is set manually by attackers. The team also uses a token value to
authorize its affiliates. These function in a way similar to conventional API authorization keys.

Figure 13. SMB Link interface.

Figure 14 depicts a code snippet responsible for managing SMB links. The single most
striking observation to emerge from the code is the usage of work queues to transfer
files simultaneously. We consider this approach a solid and speedy way to manage data
exfiltration efficiently.

Ransomware Software

In this section, we provide technical analysis of PYSA’s ransomware encryption and
decryption executables.
3.3.1

Encryption

PYSA malware travels between hard drives recursively and looks for user files to encrypt.
The executable starts a new thread for an encryption routine on every new directory visit
and puts a README ransom note in each directory. In order to keep the system functioning, it
does not encrypt executable files along with necessary system files. It features hardcoded
extensions that identify these files and excludes them from the encryption algorithm. Every
eligible file is encrypted and given a ”.pysa” extension. The recursive visit routine is shown
below.

TLP:WHITE

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

PYSA ransomware generates a KEY and an IV value for each file. Key generation is done by
AutoSeededRandomPool. This is a randomly generated key later used for file encryption with
AES CBC Mode algorithm. The generating process is shown below.

Figure 16. Random KEY and IV generation.

The ransomware executable encrypts files in blocks of 100 bytes. The block count loop starts
by reading a block, encrypts that block, flushing it into the file and then starting back at the
corresponding position to prepare for the next block. The relevant code snippet is shown
below.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Once the routine described above successfully encrypts a file, the ransomware moves on to
encrypt both KEY and IV values with an RSA public key. This information is needed later for
decryption. The ransomware moves to the beginning of the file and puts the encrypted KEY
and IV values there.
The RSA public key is stored in encoded format. The RSA key content and decryption process
is shown below.

Decryption

PYSA ransomware’s decryption method is straightforward and executes the reverse
of the encryption process described above. The decryption software has an RSA private
key embedded in it, and this RSA private key is associated with the particular encryption
executable unique to each victim, as shown below.

Figure 22. Embedded associated RSA private key.

The decryption software recursively visits each file and runs its program. For every file, it must
first retrieve input previously encrypted AES CBC Mode algorithm parameters. Using the RSA
private key, it can decrypt KEY and IV values. Once it has the necessary parameters, it can
successfully restore file content and replace each filename with its original extension. The
decryption routine is shown below.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Statistics and Observations

This section provides the victim statistics by month, threat actor activity graph, and
findings on author profiling.

4.1

Victim Statistics

Since September 2020, the PYSA team apparently exfiltrated the data from 747 victims
to the management panel. December 2020 and June 2021 were the most active months,
with approximately 90 victims each month. The victim count remained elevated after June
2021, only tailing off at the end of the year.

Figure 24. Victim statistics by month.

The uptick in activity may coincide with the PYSA team’s development cycle initiatives for
enabling full text search and other useful features. It’s plausible that PYSA’s leaders thought
this kind of functionality would give it a competitive edge in the cybercrime marketplace by
making it easier for affiliates to operate large-scale attack campaigns.
PYSA released the confidential files of 309 victims in their public leak server, and we
detected 747 victims in their management panel. According to the findings, we can roughly
calculate the success (ransom/payment) ratio of the ransomware gang, which is around
58%. Notwithstanding, the ratio raises intriguing questions regarding the nature and extent
of the cybercriminal’s motivations. Further studies, which take these variables into account,
will need to be undertaken.

4.2

Threat Actor Activity

The activity of individual threat actors suggests a group of four highly engaged users
with wide-ranging access. Together, these four users make up more than 90 percent of
activity on the group’s management panel. The other active users collectively make up the
rest, which might mean there is a relatively small group of affiliates that are less involved in
the day-to-day operations of the PYSA group.

TLP:WHITE

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Figure 25. Threat actor activity statistics.

Since there appear to be multiple time zones represented throughout PYSA’s core
infrastructure, it’s likely that its primary users come from different parts of the world, and work
together solely online. This would suggest that PYSA threat actors managed to sustain an
effective and well-organized development cycle pipeline as a distributed global team.

Author Profiling and Linguistic Evidence

Deep sensors planted by the PTI team can capture, interrupt, and react to information
traffic between the cybercriminals in secret and public communication channels. We
accumulate linguistic evidence to strengthen our criminal profiling capabilities as part of our
cyber attribution efforts. AUCH (Autorenprofile für die Untersuchung von Cyberkriminalität
CH) is our recently developed deep neural networks empowered author profiling technology.
AUCH can analyze the language of cybercriminals to reveal important information regarding
their identities. It operates based on data and cyber-insight we have acquired over the
years with our unparalleled proactive approach against cybercrime.

AUCH is currently a preliminary stage research project supported by the Swiss
Innovation Agency, Innosuisse. We collaborate with our partners at the University
of Zurich to integrate cutting-edge linguistics research into cybersecurity. In the
upcoming months, we will be able to showcase more features we work on to support
our investigations and consolidate our scientific approach against cybercrime.

Figure 26. PYSA ransomware statement from their website.

The individuals behind the PYSA cybercrime group are known to be well-trained and
well-resourced. Most of the acquired messages were written by authors with an excellent
command of the English language. However, as the linguistic evidence accumulated,
AUCH was able to identify edge cases for author profiling. AUCH also exploits the
recent developments in XAI (Explainable artificial intelligence) to generate human-friendly
explanations based on gradient and perturbation methods to provide our threat intelligence
analysts with the necessary insights to work towards robust cyber-attribution. [2, 1] We will
be limiting our explainability discussion to three different meaningful examples generated by
AUCH to show how our system captures different linguistic relationships.
4.3.1

Grammaticality

Ransom Note #1 : Every byte on any types of your devices was encrypted. Don’t try to use
backups because it were encrypted too.
Our inference engine detected the grammatical violations in the ransom messages found
in compromised systems. Unlike the rest of the evidence, these messages included errors in
the English language’s fundamental aspects, such as subject-verb and pronoun-antecedent
agreements. We do not see any evidence that these errors were replicated anywhere else in
the acquired messages.
4.3.2

Unnatural Statements

PYSA Victim Statements #1 : Don’t miss out on the most interesting (things) (leak), there is
something to please the sophisticated audience.
The non-existing noun in the (DET+ADVERB+ADJECTIVE) combination was flagged by the
profiling system. It is possible to introduce a noun from the phrase ”the most interesting” in
German (das Interessanteste) but not in English. We think this linguistic innovation results
from the native language of the author.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

PYSA Victim Statements #2 : The main bonus from our partners is such information as
criminal cases and material evidence on them, technical plans of buildings and structures
of the city, confidential information about police officers. More than 20 GB of data that
will not leave you aside.
The phrasal verb ”leave you aside” was flagged as a linguistic anomaly by our profiling
system. It is possible to ”leave something aside” but not ”leave someone aside” in the English
language. This is most likely a calque statement resulting from the influence of the native
language of the author.
PYSA Victim Statements #3 : Our partners will also not leave the opportunity to show
you the calculations of budgets for future years, financial reports and documentation,
personal data of employees.
The term ”calculations of budgets” was flagged as a possible word order influence by our
profiling system. It is a very unnatural statement for an English native speaker in this context.
A native speaker would probably prefer ”budget calculations” instead. In most European
languages, it is possible to find root-for-root translations with the same word order. (DE :
Berechnung des Budgets, PT : cálculos de orçamentos, IT : calcolo dei bilanci, ESP : cálculo
de los presupuestos).

4.3.3

Syntax

PYSA Victim Statements - Author #1 : Here they will present for you (with) tax files, budget
calculations and their formation, current settlements, payment orders, etc. 1.55 Gb files
that will not cease to be relevant at any time.
PYSA Victim Statements - Author #2 : One of the largest colleges in the State presents
(for) you with bank records, budget calculations, scanned documents, and photos of its
employees.
To further strengthen our claims, our inference engine has identified a prepositional
innovation by one of the authors. The first author uses the preposition combination ”present
for you” instead of ”present someone with” which is a distinctive dissimilarity for author
profiling. However, this very linguistic innovation is not replicated in some of the other
messages on the victim announcement board, which brings the existence of multiple authors
into question. Upon inspection, our algorithm found that the linguistic style of the messages
without innovations is different from the rest, confirming the existence of another author.

Based on our first analysis, threat actors most likely have ties to Europe but also
employs different actors who are non-native English speakers.

PYSA (Mespinoza) Case Report

Conclusion

PYSA has shown itself capable of highly destructive ransomware attacks on critical
infrastructure organizations, using a ”big game hunting” approach to extort large enterprises
into paying immense ransoms quickly. The PTI Team’s research offers a rare glimpse at
how the group’s techniques, tactics, and procedures enable it to achieve its goals. More
importantly, the gang does not delete the files even after receiving ransom money. Authorities
always underline ”Don’t pay the ransom” publicly to prevent financial support to ransomware
gangs.
Unlike highly automated threats that target huge numbers of victims at a time, PYSA is
a highly manual ransomware operator that focuses exclusively on high-value targets.
Nevertheless, the group’s development cycle shows that it prizes automation and workflow
efficiency greatly, and has actively invested in improving its capabilities. Its development
team even created user-friendly tools like a full-text search engine to facilitate highly
scalable automated workflows.
Most ransomware gangs like PYSA use a double-extortion technique against their victims,
and the victim’s data is both exfiltrated and encrypted. Almost 58% of the PYSA victims paid
the ransom, which presents the danger of this common technique. The data in this report will
shape cybersecurity professionals’ understanding of how groups like PYSA work and what
motivates them. This adds considerable value to the insight threat intelligence operatives
can provide to the IT leaders who rely on them.
PRODAFT and its threat intelligence platform USTA 6 deliver actionable insights to
cybersecurity professionals to understand threat actors better, anticipate their next move,
and respond faster once an incident occurs. To learn more about our platform or our CIN
network, you can contact us on our website.
