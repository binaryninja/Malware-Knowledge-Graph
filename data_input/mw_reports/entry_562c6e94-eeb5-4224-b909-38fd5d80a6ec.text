Nefilim Ransomware Threatens to Expose Stolen Data
trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/nefilim-ransomware-threatens-to-expose-stolen-data

A new ransomware named Nefilim has been discovered, threatening to release its victims’ data to

the public if they fail to pay the ransom. It is most likely distributed through exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), as shared by
SentinelLabs’ Vitali Krimez and ID Ransomware's Michael Gillespie via Bleeping Computer.

Nefilim’s code shares many notable similarities with Nemty 2.5 ransomware; the main difference is the fact that Nefilim has done away with
the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) component. It also manages payments via email communication rather than through a Tor payment
site. There is nothing that indicates that the same threat actors are behind Nemty and Netfilim. The new ransomware is most likely spread
through RDP, like other ransomware such as Nemty, Crysis, and SAMSAM.
Netfilim uses AES-128 encryption to encrypt victim’s files. An RSA-2048 embedded in the ransomware executable will then encrypt the AES
encryption key. The encrypted AES key will then be added to every encrypted key. The ransomware also adds a “NEFILIM” string as a file
marker to all encrypted files. The encrypted files will have .NEFILIM appended to their file names (for example, a file called 1.doc would be
named 1.doc.NEFILIM).

To decrypt these files, victims need to get the RSA private key from the ransomware developers. Details of the ransom have not been
released yet.

Race against ransomware
Ransomware continues to expand its reach as threat actors continue to come up with new ransomware variants and families. The
healthcare, government, and education sectors were on the receiving end of many such attacks last year, as revealed in the Trend Micro
2019 Annual Security Roundup. Unfortunately, many feel pressured to pay the ransom to prevent the paralysis of operations and the loss of
valuable data.

Like Nefilim, many of these ransomware attacks abuse exposed RDP ports. Enterprises can take the following steps to defend against RDP
abuse:
Close unused RDP ports. If closing them is not possible, limit the source addresses that can access the ports.
Configure settings to ensure that only authorized users can gain RDP network admin access.
Monitor the network to spot signs of attacks.
Limit the number of failed login attempts to keep unauthorized logins at bay.

Companies should also establish firm protocols and rules in dealing with unverified emails; employees should avoid opening these emails or
attachments. To prevent data loss, employees should also regularly backup files. Finally, regularly updating software and applications can
ensure that the system is protected against both old and recent vulnerabilities.

Enterprises can also further improve security against ransomware through the combination of behavioral analysis and high-fidelity machine
learning across email, endpoints, servers, and networks.
