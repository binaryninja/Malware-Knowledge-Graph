This section looks at intelligence gathering and collection activity conducted by threat actors based in different geographic regions.

A greater reliance on remote working
brought in to focus the new and existing
threats to related technologies and
infrastructure.

Introduction
2020 saw a distinct shift in the cyber threat
landscape, with ransomware becoming the most
significant cyber security threat faced by
organisations, irrespective of industry sector or
location. The COVID-19 pandemic also permeated
through the cyber world as threat actors exploited
the resulting fear and uncertainty. A greater reliance
on remote working brought in to focus the new and
existing threats to related technologies and
infrastructure.
Major shifts in the tactics used by the threat actors
behind multiple ransomware families saw mass
data exfiltration performed prior to encrypting a
victim’s systems. As a result, leak sites came into
prominence, bringing the compromise directly into
the public domain and increasing pressure on
victims to meet ransom demands. The success of
such operations brought new players to the market
and even attracted established cyber criminal
groups to add ransomware to their portfolios. As
the demand for ransomware services grew, affiliate
programmes and Ransomware-as-a-Service
(RaaS) schemes lowered the barrier to entry for
inexperienced threat actors.
Like the rest of the world, threat actors adapted to
the changes brought about by the global pandemic.
Both cyber criminals and advanced persistent
threat actors (APTs) were quick to incorporate the
theme in their phishing emails and document lures.
The pandemic theme evolved over time to reflect
shifting concerns from the availability of masks, to
financial aid schemes, and news about vaccines,
showing that most threat actors are willing to
exploit any circumstance to make their operations

more successful. For the most part, threat actors
used these themes to carry out their normal
activity, however, response efforts have also been a
focal point with vaccine-related research highly
sought after by several threat actors.
Several themes observed in 2019 continued to play
their part in the threat landscape throughout 2020:
intelligence gathering activity has continued to
align to the geopolitical landscape, mirroring
real-world events and the strategic aims of nation
states; there has also been a growing trend of
threat actors historically aligned to espionage
activity being linked to financially motivated activity,
in operations likely motivated by personal gain; and
the supply chain remained a key target with threat
actors looking to exploit privileged access and
trusted relationships. In 2020, both the public and
private sectors continued to be brazen in attributing
cyber attacks and making greater use of legal
action to disrupt malicious activity.
This report analyses the overarching and thematic
trends from 2020, including mapping tools,
techniques, and procedures to the cyber threat
landscape. Our analysis is based on our in-house
intelligence datasets on cyber attacks and targeting
from a variety of threat actors, intelligence gleaned
from our incident response engagements around
the world, and our Managed Cyber Defence
service, as well as publicly available information
from the cyber security community. This report
intends to highlight the most prolific cyber trends
PwC observed throughout 2020 and explore their
wider impact.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 1

A cyber
pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an
unprecedented global impact, with
organisations across all sectors
having to adapt and find new ways of
working. The shift to remote working
brought immediate risks and altered
the threat landscape for many
organisations. Changes to standard
work practices and an increased level
of messaging has put employees at a
greater risk of exploitation through
social engineering. At the technical
level, the rapid deployment of new
VPN endpoints and introduction of
online collaboration tools, has not
only served to facilitate remote
working, but also increased the
potential attack surface.

PwC has seen both cyber
criminals and espionage
threat actors taking
advantage of this massive
shift, with widespread
targeting of all sectors
and regions.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 2

Business as usual
As the impact of the virus spread across the
globe, threat actors were quick to capitalise
on the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty,
enticing individuals to open phishing lures or
browse to a malicious website. Whilst the use
of timely lures mirroring real world events is a
common tactic, as a theme, COVID-19 has
been abused by both cyber criminals and
espionage threat actors on a wide scale.
From our observations, the majority of threat
actors started using the pandemic as a
persistent lure theme by late February 2020,
and volumes of COVID-19 themed lures
peaked in March, with a significant decrease
in the second half of the year. For the most
part, the predominant objective has been to
continue normal operations, with threat actors
making minor updates to their phishing
and lure material to incorporate pandemicrelated themes.
We observed these phishing themes evolve
over time to align with shifting priorities.1 At
the start of the pandemic, common themes
included notifications and advice from
healthcare organisations and businesses, the
availability of products such as face masks
and testing kits, news of vaccines, and remote
working. These were in addition to more
traditional lures, such as delivery notifications
and invoices, which were adapted to include
advice or a sense of urgency due to the
pandemic. As financial aid schemes were
rolled out, we observed spoofed websites
designed to harvest credentials or
personal information.

Coronavirus lockdown: What can and can’t
you do under new UK laws?
Not all parts of government guidance can be enforced by

Lizzie Dearden Home Affairs Correspondent @lizziedearden
The government has imposed unprecedented restrictions on the
British public in an attempt to slow the spread if coronavirus.
Boris Johnson initially called for people to voluntarily use social
distancing measures, before announcing a lockdown on 23 March.
But there are significant differences between the government’s
guidance, and the laws that can be enforced by the police with
fines and criminal proceedings.
There are also differences between the legal restrictions in force in
England Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 3

Cyber criminal threat actors were quick on the
uptake – in January 2020, an Emotet campaign
targeting Japan referenced reports of COVID-19
infections within phishing emails.2 PwC analysed
TrickBot spam campaigns which used a range of
different social engineering themes, including
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), COVID-19
testing kits and UK government financial
compensation packages for furloughed workers.3
These were crafted to induce victims into enabling
content on malicious attachments designed to
download the malware. We also observed White
Austaras (a.k.a. TA505) using a COVID-19 themed
phishing email to target users across North
America.4 This included targets in the healthcare,
manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries in the
US;5 this reflected a wider trend by threat actors to
exploit the pandemic as a means to distribute both
mass and targeted spam campaigns, while public
susceptibility to social engineering was likely to be
at its highest.
Espionage threat actors also made use of
COVID-19 themed lures in conducting their
campaigns.6 For example, the Vietnam-based
threat actor, Scarlet Ioke (a.k.a. OceanLotus,
APT32) was observed using a COVID-19 themed
lure to target Mandarin speaking victims.7 Decoy
documents with content taken from the New York
Times and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture were
displayed to the user upon execution, whilst the
malicious process ran in the background. This was
observed to drop a remote access trojan (RAT)
known as DenesRAT as the final payload.

Targeted response
As the pandemic took hold, the search for a
vaccine became a global priority, with
breakthroughs in this area seen as a necessary
step in getting back to normality. We saw several
advanced persistent threat actors (APTs)
performing intelligence gathering and collection
activities on organisations involved in the research
and rollout of vaccine targeting. There are several
factors which make this data valuable. On a
country level, the ability to produce vaccines and
associated treatments domestically would create a
level of supply resilience and minimise the costs
associated with purchasing from third parties.
There may also be a political advantage to be
gained from the successful rollout of
vaccination schemes.

WellMess
In July 2020, the UK’s National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC) reported that malware known as
WellMess was used to perform intelligence
gathering from several organisations involved with
COVID-19 vaccine development.8 The activity was
attributed to the Russia-based threat actor, Blue
Kitsune (a.k.a. APT29). WellMess is a highly
versatile backdoor; we have analysed samples
written in both. NET and Go, with the latter seen in
32-bit and 64-bit variants as both ELF and PE files,
allowing for deployment to different architectures.9
It has several robust network communication
methods and a wide range of functionality including
the ability to run PowerShell scripts post-infection.
Through our analysis, we observed strings used as
file paths which likely indicate the exploitation of
COVID-19 research facilities by the threat actor.
These correspond to a Canadian vaccine
research company and the University that stood up
the Research Headquarters for Epidemic
Prevention and Control with the Chinese Academy
of Science.10

An AppleSeed a day

A Charming phish

Between late August and November 2020, we
observed North Korea-based threat actor Black
Banshee (a.k.a. Kimsuky) registering domains
impersonating a number of entities in the
healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors and
involved in COVID-19 vaccine and treatment
research in Europe and South Korea, as well as the
World Health Organisation (WHO).11 Further
domains impersonating other entities in the
biopharmaceutical space had infrastructure
overlaps with command and control (C2) servers for
AppleSeed and FlowerPower, two malware families
we attribute uniquely to Black Banshee.12

Iran-based threat actor Yellow Garuda (a.k.a.
Charming Kitten) was observed by PwC using
a fake Yahoo login page that almost certainly
looked to be targeting the email account of an
executive within a major pharmaceutical
company working on the COVID-19 vaccine.13
This activity was in alignment to open source
reports that the same pharmaceutical
company was being targeted by the threat
actor.14 The campaign involved the use of a
domain attempting to obtain a two-factor
authentication (2FA) code for this email
account, which the threat actor could
subsequently use to bypass the email’s
security check. Given the profile of the victim
and our understanding of how Yellow Garuda
conducts its campaigns, it is likely that the
individual was targeted as a means to gaining
access to corporate information.

Although the WHO has confirmed that North Korea
would be among the low-income countries to be
supported in the COVAX Advance Market
Commitment agreement to allow access to
COVID-19 treatment drugs and vaccination, and
despite North Korean government officials denying
that there have been any COVID-19 cases in the
country, North Korea continues to be under
international sanctions and cut off from the
international research community. It is likely that
Black Banshee’s uptick in COVID-19 related activity
was motivated by intelligence gathering, as vaccine
and treatment trials were underway.

Probing for vulnerabilities
In May 2020, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
issued a joint announcement concerning the targeting of COVID-19 research organisations by China-based threat actors.
It was reported that threat actors had attempted to obtain data concerning vaccines, treatments and testing from
‘networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research’.15
This announcement aligns with accusations made in an indictment against two Chinese nationals, unsealed by the US
Department of Justice (DOJ) in July 2020.16 The indictment accused the individuals of conducting intelligence gathering
cyber attacks in alignment to state interests, as well as financially motivated attacks for personal gain. Whilst the list of
alleged attacks went back to 2009, the individuals were also accused of probing for vulnerabilities in organisations
involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments. However, it is noted that their
focus on healthcare preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.17

Intelligence
gathering
Throughout 2020, there was
continued alignment between the
cyber threat landscape and
geopolitical events, with cyber
activity seemingly conducted in
support of nation state strategy. In
this section, we look at intelligence
gathering and collection activity
conducted by threat actors based
in different geographic regions.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 6

Asia Pacific
The view from Pyongyang
Late 2019 saw the collapse of bilateral talks
between the US and North Korea, which had aimed
to defuse military tension and nuclear proliferation,
with the potential for North Korea to obtain some
reprieve from international sanctions. Under these
conditions, Kim Jong Un’s New Year Address to the
Workers’ Party of Korea set out to reorientate
strategic priorities. In particular, the intention not to
act in order to alleviate international sanctions, but
to achieve national strategic objectives in spite of
them. This includes the continued development of a
nuclear force and a rearrangement of the country’s
current economic disposition.
Throughout 2020, North Korea-based threat actors
maintained a very high operational tempo. PwC
observed these threat actors conducting multiple
campaigns on a global scale, in pursuit of
complementary and at times overlapping targets, in
overall alignment with the national interests of
North Korea.

Black Artemis
Show, don’t tell: the ShowState campaign
Throughout 2020, we observed Black Artemis
(a.k.a. HIDDEN COBRA, Lazarus Group)
aggressively pursuing companies and individuals in
the aerospace and defence industry, as well as
organisations and individuals dealing in
cryptocurrency, as part of a persistent, coordinated
campaign we call ShowState.18

The campaign featured significant social
engineering efforts. Individual victims at targeted
organisations were lured into opening malicious
attachments, which mainly contained job
descriptions for roles at prominent aerospace and
defence companies in the UK, the US, as well as
India, among other countries. Public threat
intelligence reporting that aligns with the ShowState
campaign, also suggested that threat actors
created ad-hoc LinkedIn profiles to reach out to
individual victims, establish a rapport, and deceive
them into opening the job specification files.19,20,21
Recruitment-themed social engineering of victims at
targeted organisations is a tactic that Black Artemis
has used on several occasions in the past, as we
noted in our ‘Cyber Threats 2019: Year in
Retrospect’ report.22
In the ShowState campaign, the job specification
lures were weaponised with malicious macros that
would drop and execute a next-stage DLL, along
with the appropriate arguments to run the backdoor
we call ShowState. We have identified variants,
including a 2020 Mach-O variant, of the same
backdoor, which is also known as BLINDINGCAN
and was the subject of a US-CERT Malware
Analysis Report in August 2020,23 going as far
back as 2017.

Throughout 2020, North Koreabased threat actors maintained a
very high operational tempo.

From Black Artemis to Mac Artemis
In May 2020, US-CERT released an advisory on a
malware family known as COPPERHEDGE, that
PwC has tracked for several years as Manuscrypt.
In 2020, Black Artemis developed several new
variants of Manuscrypt across multiple platforms,
including PowerShell, ELF, and Mach-O samples in
addition to the known x86 and x64 Portable
Executable variants.24
Its efforts to develop or update its custom tools in
order to target MacOS have been ongoing since at
least 2018, as evidenced by public reports, 25 and
have included a multi-platform plugin-based
malware framework known as MATA 26 or Dacls
RAT.27 Its efforts in this area likely reflect a need to
widen its targeting capabilities, particularly in
relation to cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms
– its early macOS campaigns specifically trojanised
trading applications.28

Black Banshee
Black Banshee (a.k.a. Kimsuky, THALLIUM) also
ramped up its operational tempo from 2019, both in
terms of the number of attacks and its victims. In
2020, we observed Black Banshee continue
campaigns using known malware like BabyShark
and GoldDragon, as well as introducing new
malware families such as AppleSeed (a.k.a.
AutoUpdate) and FlowerPower.

Infrastructure for deception
Similar to Black Artemis, we also observed Black
Banshee make renewed efforts to socially engineer
victims through multiple means. The threat actor
continued to use suitably timely lure documents
with themes that would be relevant to targets. For
example, we tracked Black Banshee’s use of lures
themed around the US presidential election in early
November 2020, and about post-election
predictions on US foreign policy thereafter.29
Additionally, Black Banshee continued to build and
operate a large network of internet infrastructure.30
The threat actor is known to register domains

highly likely intended to impersonate specific target
organisations. Some of these were then used to
launch email phishing campaigns, some to host
fake login portals for credential phishing, and some
for malware command and control.31

Persistent and sweeping
Overall, Black Banshee actively pursued victims on
an international scale: from long-standing target
countries like South Korea, to recent areas of
intense focus like Japan. We observed Black
Banshee target entities across multiple sectors,
including:
•

Government entities in South Korea and
supranational bodies, including the United
Nations and the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights at the UN;

•

Defence companies internationally, including in
South Korea and Eastern Europe;

•

Higher education institutions across South
Korea, Japan, and the United States;

•

Journalists and news organisations in South
Korea and the United States; and,

•

Cryptocurrency systems and entities involved
with blockchain products and research.

Overall, the activity that we assess to have been
conducted by Black Artemis and Black Banshee in
2020 is a testament to the double nature of the
threat actors’ strategic objectives and
requirements:
•

Espionage motivated intelligence gathering,
likely for military, defence or economic
purposes; and,

•

Financially motivated activity, that an August
2019 United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
report described as ‘a source of funds for a
professional branch of the military’.32 This type
of activity is a way to guarantee the North
Korean regime the ability to operate in spite of
international economic sanctions, rather than
having to act in order to alleviate them.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 8

Sharing is compromising:
China-based threat actors and the
digital quartermaster
In 2020, PwC observed China-based threat actors
executing campaigns that continue to closely align
with China’s strategic objectives. Key areas of focus
were countries connected to the contentious South
China Sea dispute, countries involved with the
international Belt and Road initiative, as well as near
neighbouring countries, especially ones with whom
China has had territorial or administrative disputes.
The primary targets included, first and foremost,
governments and public entities on an international
scale, and telecommunications providers; sectors
that correspond to strategic priorities outlined in the
current Five Year Plan and likely to be part of the
next;33 and religious communities.
The sharing of custom tooling among China-based
threat actors continues to create a springboard for
intrusions, while posing a further challenge to
attribution of malicious activity.

Each time, the weaponised documents have been
deployed with unique characteristics,
infrastructure, capability and victimology overlaps
which has enabled attribution of the sets of activity
to a specific threat actor. Some of the main users of
the 8.t framework in 2020 are detailed below:
•

Red Hariasa (a.k.a. Chinoxy) , the threat actor
that PwC assesses is the only one to use both
the Chinoxy and FunnyDream backdoors, has
been one of the primary users of the 8.t
framework in 2020. PwC has observed activity
using the Chinoxy backdoor targeting countries
in Central and South East Asia, including
Kyrgyzstan,37 Malaysia,38 and Vietnam.39

•

Red Orthrus (a.k.a. KeyBoy, APT23) also used
the 8.t framework as part of its continuous
targeting of the Mongolian government and
Mongolian public sector entities, to then deploy
PoisonIvy payloads40 or the backdoor known as
KeyBoy CotX RAT.

•

An espionage motivated threat actor that PwC
tracks as Red Nue (a.k.a. SpyDealer) used the
8.t framework in July 2020 to create a Russianlanguage lure document dropping the LootRat
backdoor.41 LootRat has been in use since at
least 2017,42 and has Android and MacOS
variants known as SpyDealer and Demsty
respectively.43

Exploited to an 8.t
One immediate example of tool sharing is the
continued use 34,35 of the 8.t document
weaponisation framework, also known as
RoyalRoad. The framework, which has evolved over
the span of two years to exploit different
vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Equation Editor,36 has
been used by multiple China-based threat actors.

It is worth noting that PwC has observed a marked
drop in usage of 8.t after the first quarter of 2020,
which could possibly be due to the framework
having been featured in public reporting on multiple
occasions covering several of its versions.44,45

The sharing of custom tooling among China-based
threat actors continues to create a springboard for
intrusions.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 9

From Winnti to ShadowPad, the new PlugX
Beyond the 8.t framework, China-based threat
actors have also been sharing sophisticated tools,
which are deployed in targeted intrusions against
high-value targets. For example, in ‘Cyber Threats
2019: A Year in Retrospect’ report, PwC assessed
that multiple China-based threat actors were using
variants of the Winnti backdoor, occasionally also
sharing infrastructure, techniques, and implants but
operating independently with different objectives.46
We continued to observe Winnti activity in 2020,
with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) also filing
an indictment in September against two individuals
associated with Red Kelpie (a.k.a. APT41, BARIUM),
one of the primary Winnti users.47
PwC has also tracked the ShadowPad backdoor
being used by at least five threat actors with
different victimology and areas of focus between
2019 and 2020. While we assess that the recently
indicted Red Kelpie was likely a primary developer
and user of the tool,48 we also identified
ShadowPad activity that we attribute to other
China-based threat actors. This included a
campaign where we observed overlaps between
the usage of ShadowPad and a Bisonal variant we
call Biscoff,49 which has also been referred to in
open source as xDll.50
We assess that the campaign, which mainly
targeted Russia and South Korea, was highly likely
conducted by Red Beifang (a.k.a. Tonto Team,
Karma Panda), which we have observed being the
second primary user of ShadowPad after
Red Kelpie.

Plugging into espionage: Red Lich’s PlugX
campaigns
PlugX is another malware family that has been
shared across multiple China-based threat actors,
and has persisted over the last decade. Throughout
2020, we observed consistent use of PlugX that we
attribute to espionage motivated China-based
threat actor Red Lich (a.k.a. Mustang Panda, Red
Delta). Red Lich has been known to use PlugX
payloads since at least November 2018,51 along
with CobaltStrike, and to have a focus on the Asia
Pacific region.
In 2020, we noted particular interest by the threat
actor in technology and telecommunications
storage in Asia Pacific, as well as in religious
communities. We identified Red Lich victims in
Myanmar, Singapore, India, and Hong Kong,52
along with further targeting and potential
compromise of organisations based in Vietnam53
and the Vatican.54 It is worth noting Red Lich’s
targeting of the Christian community,55,56
specifically in Hong Kong, and of a Vatican-based
NGO, between May and July 2020, is in line with
Red Lich’s previous victimology – including
religious communities and minorities, both Catholic
organisations57 and Tibetan.58 However, the uptick
in observed activity for this specific Red Lich
campaign between May and July 2020 coincided
with a period of tense relationships between the
Vatican and Chinese authorities, over a provisional
agreement on the appointment of Catholic Bishops
in China.

Case study
Red Phoenix compromises a technology company in Western Europe
PwC’s Incident Response team responded to a
Red Phoenix intrusion into a technology company
in Western Europe in 2020.59 The threat actor had
access to the network from at least May 2019 and
maintained access until early March 2020. It initially
compromised the victim by exploiting an exposed
out of date Confluence server, using CVE-20193396. It subsequently deployed the FOCUSFJORD
(a.k.a. SoldierTrojan, SoldierLoader) malware family,
which we exclusively attribute to Red Phoenix. The
threat actor used custom tools as well as living off
the land techniques (‘LOLbins’) to move laterally
around the network. It pivoted to several other
machines, and deployed HyperBro, another
malware family exclusively attributed to
Red Phoenix.

In February 2020, the threat actor attempted to
maintain access to the victim network by installing
updated versions of HyperBro that sideload from a
different executable. The new malware beaconed
out to the same C2 IPs and the payload had the
same capabilities, allowing the new and previously
unseen binaries to be detected by heuristic rules.
Following eviction, the threat actor aggressively
tried to reacquire access to the network, attempting
to access perimeter systems from IPs it had not
used previously in the intrusion, but which had
already been provided to the client to block by
PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The other side of the coin
In addition to China and North Korea-based threat actor activity, PwC noted a significant uptick in activities from threat
actors based in other countries within the region during 2020. This is mostly likely due to ongoing conflicts in the region,
which have only increased in intensity over the last year. Kinetic conflict has been seen between India and Pakistan, as
well as India and China, whilst the South China Sea continues to be a hotbed of political tension. Tit-for-tat hostilities
have played out in the cyber realm, with threat actors based in Pakistan, India, and Vietnam alike ramping up their volume
of operations, whilst simultaneously expanding their tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Pakistan

India

The Pakistan-based threat actor Green Havildar
(a.k.a. TransparentTribe, Mythic Leopard) continued
its use of its backdoor CrimsonRAT in a vast
number of campaigns, including, but not limited to:

The targeting displayed by India-based threat
actors has mirrored political events, with a
substantial increase in targeting of China-based
targets, as well as consistent espionage operations
against Pakistan government and defence sectors.
The campaigns conducted over the course of 2020
displayed both new and previously observed TTPs,
whilst the lure documents often used news articles
or documents published just days before the attack
itself. This provides an insight into the reactive
nature of these threat actors.

•

Targeting India Defence targets, using lure
documents looking to mimic commendations to
soldiers on the 72nd Army Day – this campaign
saw the threat actor host its payloads on a
website feigning legitimacy as a shared drive.60

•

Targeting Iranian political targets over several
campaigns, making use of both religious and
political themes in lure documents61 – the
motivations behind this campaign are thought
to stem from both Pakistan-Iran border
tensions,62 as well as concern for PakistanAfghanistan border security after the election of
the new Quds force leader following the death
of General Qasem Soleimani.63

2020 also saw the threat actor develop a new tool,
which in open source is known as ObliqueRAT.64
PwC has observed several campaigns in 2020
employing ObliqueRAT alongside password
protected lure documents that are highly likely
provided to the victim during correspondence.65
This shift towards a focus on active social
engineering is a new technique for the threat actor.
Green Havildar’s crime wing (a.k.a. Gorgon Group,
Aggah), has also conducted a large number of
campaigns, switching its initial delivery mechanism
from Word and Excel documents to Powerpoint.66
PwC has observed these campaigns being
conducted on a near weekly basis,67 and it is likely
– based on their sheer volume in 2020 – we will
continue to see these financially motivated attacks
continue in 2021.

Orange Chandi
The India-based threat actor Orange Chandi (a.k.a.
Sidewinder) was particularly prolific in 2020,
conducting espionage operations targeting the
defence sector. Victims have been based mostly in
Pakistan and China, but PwC has also observed
targets in Afghanistan. The payloads all used a
familiar attack process from the threat actor of
multiple HTA scripts to eventually deploy the final
payload.68,69,70,71

Orange Kala
Orange Kala (a.k.a. Donot) also had an extremely
active year. The threat actor employed several
techniques across 2020, some of which PwC has
observed previously, whilst others see the threat actor
retooling in real time. For example, PwC was able to
obtain several lure documents and payloads that
were not yet complete or ready for operational use.72
These files were subsequently used in attacks a
few weeks after our initial discovery, likely targeting
victims in Pakistan’s Defence sector. The threat
actor was also seen using open source espionage
tools for its payloads, such as the remote access
trojan WarZoneRAT,73 sold as a Malware as a
Service (MaaS).74

Orange Athos
Orange Athos (a.k.a. Patchwork) was observed in
2020 displaying several techniques PwC had not
previously observed or associated with the Indiabased threat actor. One consistent campaign in
July and August 2020 saw the threat actor use a
vulnerability involving Encapsulated PostScript
(EPS) images (CVE-2017-0261),75 with lure
documents targeting:
•

Chinese speaking individuals concerned with
Sino-Indian border tensions;

•

Individuals interested in Saudi-Pakistan
relations (specifically organisations in oil & gas);
and,

The threat actor also continued to adapt its toolset
to focus on victims that run MacOS in 2020.79
Significantly, Scarlet Ioke was publicly attributed by
Facebook to an IT company-based in Vietnam
called CyberOne Group; or CyberOne Security.80
According to the attribution, the company operates
on behalf of the Vietnam government, although it is
unclear whether CyberOne Group makes up the
entirety of all operations attributed to Scarlet Ioke,
or a sub-section of them.
The operations of Scarlet Ioke in 2020 broadly
consist of the following:
•

Espionage campaigns focused on intelligence
gathering from other nation states in South East
Asia. This includes the targeting of both
computer and mobile devices; 81,82

Another significant operation undertaken by
Orange Athos saw the threat actor taking
advantage of GitHub repositories in order to pull
further payloads onto the victim’s machine.76 What
made this campaign particularly unique was the
effort made by the threat actor to create
sophisticated lure documents written in Mandarin
Chinese; India-based threat actors will for the most
part use news articles, but in this instance the
threat actor appeared to hand-craft the lure
documents.

•

Website creation and hijacking for the purposes
of profiling users that visit the sites, and having
the capability to subject them to further
malicious phishing sites or malware payloads.
These operations have been documented
targeting not just victims of other South East
Asian nations, but also individuals in
Vietnam itself;83

•

Espionage campaigns against individuals in
Vietnam, using malicious files such as CVs and
letters of invitation;84

Vietnam

•

Espionage campaigns against Vietnamese
dissidents, now living abroad; and,85

•

Conducting corporate espionage against private
sector entities, as well as deploying
cryptocurrency miners on these victims’
networks in order to either monetise its
intrusions, or potentially act as a false flag for
the intrusion’s purpose.86

•

Individuals interested in Pakistan-China
relations (specifically in the technology sector)

Of the many threat actors that pervade the Asia
Pacific cyberspace, there were few as active and
diverse in their activities as Vietnam-based Scarlet
Ioke (a.k.a. OceanLotus, APT32, White Ioke). It ran
a substantial number of operations, favouring not
just open source tools, such as CobaltStrike, but
also building up bespoke capabilities of its own,
such as the remote access trojan DenesRAT.77,78

Europe
Espionage motivated threat actors based in Russia
and the former Soviet Union, which seek to access
or steal intelligence, continued to be active
throughout 2020. This activity includes the
continuation of common targeting themes, such as
the Russia-based threat actors Blue Python (a.k.a.
Turla) and Blue Athena (a.k.a. APT28) targeting
Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Central and Eastern
Europe, and also responses to emerging global
events, such as Russia-based threat actor Blue
Kitsune targeting COVID-19 vaccine research.87
At a strategic level, 2020 brought some interesting
geopolitical shifts to the region, in particular
through the conflict over the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region which, de jure, is a
part of Azerbaijan, but which has been under the
de facto control of the unrecognised, Armeniabacked Republic of Artsakh since 1994. In
September 2020, major armed conflict broke out in
the region, and lasted several weeks. We tracked
several threat actors targeting parties to the conflict
or using themes related to it. These include White
Dev 51, a threat actor we assess to likely be based
in or affiliated with Armenia, and spear phishing
activity from the Russia/Ukraine-based threat actor
Blue Odin (a.k.a. Cloud Atlas).

Nagorno-Karabakh: a frozen
conflict ignites88
Nagorno-Karabakh is a territory which has been
disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan since
before the fall of the Soviet Union. The region, while
populated mostly by ethnic Armenians, is
internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan,
and has been formally under Azerbaijani control
since the fall of the Soviet Union. However, since
the first Nagorno-Karabakh war, which ended in
1994 with a Russia-brokered ceasefire, the region
has been under the control of the Armenia-backed
Republic of Artsakh, and remains unrecognised by
the international community.
In September 2020, Azerbaijani forces reportedly
launched offensives intended to recapture occupied
buffer areas surrounded by Azerbaijan, as well as
push into the region itself. The conflict was largely
dictated by Azerbaijan, which made substantial gains,
eventually capturing the strategic city of Shusha.

This resulted in thousands of casualties, both military
and civilian, and tens of thousands of civilians have
been displaced. This conflict ended in a Russiabrokered ceasefire in November 2020, which saw
Azerbaijan regain the buffer areas surrounding
Nagorno-Karabakh and keep its gains within the
region itself.
We have tracked a range of threat actor activity
connected to this conflict, by threat actors across a
broad range of levels of sophistication:

1

Hacktivist groups such as ‘Anti-Armenia Team’ and ‘Monte
Melkonian Cyber Army’ have engaged in tit-for-tat leaking
of information, including internal government emails and
data related to a nuclear power plant in Armenia.

2

A threat actor of unknown origin, tracked by PwC as White
Dev 51, used a Python-based backdoor known as PoetRAT,
to target Azerbaijani government organisations. PoetRAT was
delivered by spear phishing documents, most often
pertaining to Azerbaijani government organisations. It
provides the threat actor with a range of common RAT
functionality, such as file manipulation and exfiltration.

3

Russia-based threat actor Blue Odin used a spear phishing
document named PKK militants in Nagorno-Karabakh.doc
containing contents cloned from an article which alleged
that several hundred PKK militants were supporting
Artsakh forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. We assess that this
document was likely used to target Azerbaijani government
organisations.

We expect that interest in the region will continue,
particularly from a number of regional players, such
as Russia, Turkey and Iran, all of which have vested
strategic interests in the power balance in the
region89 – Russia for its direct involvement in
peacekeeping, Turkey as Azerbaijan’s closest ally
and partner, and Iran for the fact it shares a border
with Armenia and Azerbaijan, control of which has
shifted dramatically as a result of the recent
ceasefire. We assess that it is highly probable that
this strategic interest will be accompanied by
activity from threat actors based in these regions.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 14

The Snake Persists
Blue Python (a.k.a Turla, Snake) is a highly
sophisticated Russia-based threat actor, known for
using a variety of complex tooling and novel
Command & Control (C2) channels, including cloud
storage,90 email attachments,91 and SMB named
pipes. We observed continued Blue Python activity
throughout 2020, which generally aligns closely
with the threat actor’s historical targeting priorities
– government agencies in Central and Eastern
Europe (with a particular focus on Ministries of
Foreign Affairs and Ministries of Interior).
Blue Python continued to use a diverse and
sophisticated toolset in order to accomplish its
objective, consisting of multiple dropper,
downloader, and backdoor malware families with a
range of levels of sophistication. Based on our
visibility into Blue Python activity, we assess that it
is likely that simpler and less powerful malware is
deployed initially, in order to assess the infected
machines and determine whether the victim is of
interest to the threat actor; it is only later that more
sophisticated malware families are delivered.

In 2020, we analysed a newly discovered malware
family we reported on as BigBoss (a.k.a.
HyperStack).93,94 BigBoss implements a simple
communications protocol over SMB named pipes.
Certain components of BigBoss closely resemble
other Blue Python malware families – for example,
the encryption scheme used in BigBoss is identical
to that of Carbon, a well-known Blue Python
malware family. In essence, BigBoss implements
familiar techniques and methods, but delivered in a
far smaller package than many more sophisticated
malware families.
We expect that Blue Python will continue to
primarily target government organisations in its
pursuit of information of strategic interest in 2021,
and that it will continue to both iterate on wellknown TTPs and develop new malware families.

In 2020, the changes in Blue Python’s toolset were
more evolutionary than revolutionary; that is, it has
primarily iterated on known malware families, rather
than introducing any entirely new variants. For
example, in May, we reported on the use of a new,
custom packer with the Kazuar backdoor, a
malware family which has been known since at
least 2017.92 We also analysed the use of
PowerShell-based loader scripts as a means of
loading several Blue Python malware families, such
as COMRAT v4 and variants of RPCBackdoor, and
the role of PowerShell scripts in a compromise of a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Eastern Europe.

Spotlight on Blue Otso
Blue Otso (a.k.a Gamaredon) is a Russia-based
threat actor which has historically targeted
Ukrainian government and defence organisations,
such as the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Blue
Otso lure documents often include references to
the self-proclaimed separatist regions known as
the ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’ and ‘Donetsk
People’s Republic’, and previous documents which
likely targeted Ukraine’s military contained content
relating to orders for military operations in
these regions.
In 2020, Blue Otso’s targeting of Ukraine both
continued and evolved; while we still saw targeting
of typical Ukrainian organisations, such as
attempts to deliver spear-phishing documents to
the National Defence Council of Ukraine, Blue Otso
also began to cast a wider net, including efforts to
target government entities in Central and Eastern
Europe in early 2020.95
In December 2020, we analysed some recent
activity of the threat actor, based on dates and
times derived from Blue Otso’s domain
registrations and malicious documents.96 These
dates and times were consistent with the threat
actor operating in Kiev or Moscow time (UTC+2
and UTC+3 respectively), with a likely working week
between Monday and Saturday, and almost no
activity observed on Sundays.

The above graph shows domain registrations by a
pair of email addresses associated with Blue Otso
in 2020. Notably, there was a significant uptick in
domain registrations in August 2020, potentially
aligning with Ukraine’s Independence Day on 24th
August. Open source reporting97 has previously
suggested that Blue Otso activity often aligns with
political events in Ukraine, including public
statements made by the SBU. We assess it is
highly likely that this spike in August 2020 was
intended to disrupt or attack Ukrainian
governmental organisations during Ukraine’s
Independence Day. This assessment is further
supported by a public announcement from the
National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine,98
which noted signs of preparation for an attack on
authorities and critical infrastructure ahead of
Independence Day.
Blue Otso was also among the threat actors we
detected having a shift in activity as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, after 31st
March, we observed a decrease in Blue Otso
activity compared to the previous months from
January to March. According to open source
information, FSB officers were required to take
annual leave around 31st March.99 Ukrainian SBU
has publicly attributed Blue Otso to the FSB,100
which may explain the drop in activity. However, the
evidence above clearly indicates a relatively rapid
return to activity, beginning in June and peaking

Middle East
Furthering Turkey’s strategic
interests
In January 2020, it was reported that DNS
hijacking101 attacks targeting organisations in
Europe and the Middle East were conducted in
alignment to Turkish interests.102 The hijacked
domains were reported to primarily include those of
Turkey’s near neighbours including government
entities, and civilian organisations within Turkey
itself. From our assessment, this activity aligned
with the known targeting and tactics of the Turkeybased threat actor Teal Kurma (a.k.a. Sea Turtle).103
DNS hijacking was a prominent technique in 2019
for Teal Kurma, during which it was seen to
compromise organisations to gain access to
credentials to change DNS records and even target
DNS registrars themselves.
Turkey’s role on the global stage is becoming
increasingly prominent as it aggressively pursues
its own interests, and thus is changing the status
quo of decades-long alliances. Tensions intensified
during the course of 2020 amongst Turkey and its
near neighbours, including Cyprus and Greece,
over disputed waters in the Eastern Mediterranean
in which Turkey has conducted seismic
exploration.104 The countries hold competing claims
over the maritime and energy interests in the area
and the rights to explore and exploit oil and gas
reserves. On the cyber stage, this has been
reflected in hacktivist activity from Greece and
Turkey-based groups in tit-for-tat activity, with each
side claiming to have compromised prominent
websites.105

Presidential elections were held within Northern
Cyprus in October 2020, the result of which was
anticipated to have a significant impact on Turkey’s
interests in the region, not least in its pursuit of oil
and gas reserves within Cypriot waters. In October
2020, PwC identified a macro-enabled Microsoft
Word document lure related to the Northern Cyprus
Presidential elections which we attributed to the
Turkey-based threat actor Teal Dev 2 (a.k.a.
Promethium).106 The resulting dropped malware
included the abuse of legitimate software which
was used to sideload malicious DLLs. The TTPs
used in the infection chain bore strong similarities
to those seen in StrongPity, a malware family
attributed to Teal Dev 2.107 The threat actor
maintained a high level of StrongPity activity during
2020, however, we have not previously seen it using
macro-enabled documents as a delivery
mechanism before. From our analysis of the
malware and the related infrastructure, we found
similar samples going back to 2018, indicating that
the threat actor has been using this technique and
malware variant for some time, albeit from our
telemetry, sparingly.

Turkey’s role on the global stage is
becoming increasingly prominent
as it aggressively pursues its own
interests.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 17

Iran’s proportional response
On 3rd January 2020, Iranian General Qasem
Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike. This
inevitably escalated existing political tensions
between the US and Iran, with Iranian officials
quick to indicate there would be a swift and
proportional response. Whilst this prompted Iran to
take kinetic measures against military bases
hosting US military personnel in Iraq,108 the initial
response in the cyber domain was more muted
than expected. This came in the form of website
defacements conducted by self-reported pro-Iran
hacktivists, and highly likely committed on an
independent basis.109
No sophisticated cyber attacks were reported
following Soleimani’s death, at least in the public
domain, nor did our telemetry indicate any
significant shift in Iran-based threat actor
behaviours in the immediate or medium term
following this event. This was unexpected; Iranbased threat actors are particularly proficient in the
realm of destructive cyber attacks, and an attack of
this type could have been considered a
proportional response to the drone strike. Following
activity involving StoneDrill, ZeroCleare and
Dustman wiper malware families in 2019,110 major
destructive attacks were noticeably absent from
Iran-based cyber activity in 2020.
However, Iran-based threat actors were far from
quiet in 2020. Economic sanctions, numerous
indictments and shifting alliances within the Middle
East have all likely played a part in cyber activity
conducted over the course of the year, as evident in
a series of tit-for-tat incidents between Iran and
Israel, with whom Iran continues to share a volatile
relationship. Following reported cyber attacks on
Israel’s water and waste management facilities in
April 2020, Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port terminal was
allegedly compromised in May, with media articles
subsequently attributing the attack to Israel.111
This sparked a series of incidents affecting Iranian
organisations and facilities prompting questions
around whether Iran was being repeatedly
targeted by sabotage attacks of either a cyber or
kinetic nature.112

Cyber attacks targeting Israeli organisations have
also been in the spotlight. In Operation Quicksand,
PowGoop, a downloader likely associated with the
espionage motivated Iran-based threat actor Yellow
Nix (a.k.a. MuddyWater) was identified on the
systems of an Israel-based organisation.113 The
ransomware family Pay2Key was also used to
target a number of Israeli organisations in
November 2020,114 with multiple commonalities
between this activity and the known modus
operandi of Iran-based threat actor Yellow Dev 15
(a.k.a. Pioneer Kitten). As the threat actor has
previously engaged in financially motivated
activities and likely has the capability to deploy
ransomware to victims, this escalation can be
considered a progression from its known
motivations.115

Yellow Nix steps up
Yellow Nix had a busy year, expanding its targeting
focus from its near neighbours in the Middle East,
to include European entities. Alongside this shift, it
made significant efforts to diversify its technical
arsenal, and broaden its range of attack vectors.
This included the development of two malware
families:

Forelord

1

This is a DLL which uses DNS tunneling for network
communication, the first time we have seen Yellow Nix
using this technique. We assess this malware was used
to target Western European entities including an
organisation in the consumer markets industry.116

MoriAgent

2

A multistage malware with backdoor functionality. We
observed its first stage delivered as an executable
masquerading as a PDF document, a deviation from
Yellow Nix’s typical macro delivery system. We assess the
malware was used to target Turkish government entities
and United Nations (UN) entities in June 2020.117,118

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 18

We also continued to see Yellow Nix attempt to
repurpose third party tools. We observed Yellow Nix
delivering the commercial remote administration tool,
Remote Utilities, to retain remote access to a
compromised victim.119 This application allows the
threat actor to remotely access a victim’s device with
full privileges, and was configured to send
connectivity details to the operator using a predefined
email address. From our observations, Yellow Nix has
used Remote Utilities since at least October 2019
through to September 2020, which indicates that this
has likely proven an effective tool in compromising its
victims, perhaps even more so in 2020, given the
increased use of remote tools.
Yellow Nix’s attempts to leverage new tools and
techniques over the past year indicate a step change
in tactics. This may in part be an effort to shift away
from its existing arsenal, some of which was notably
leaked in 2019.120 In any case, Yellow Nix has shown
itself to be a versatile threat actor; although we
continue to observe it fall back on its tried and tested
techniques, during 2020 it made considerable
advances in its sophistication, shifting from VBScript
and PowerShell payloads to developing multiple
variants of bespoke malware.

Yellow Liderc’s targeting typically falls in
three categories:
Direct targeting of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia
This encompasses organisations in a wide variety
of sectors, including petrochemicals, IT managed
service providers and IT consultants, business
process outsourcers, transport, financial services,
government and defence.
Upstream/downstream targeting

Many Yellow Liderc targets appear to have direct
relationships with Saudi Arabia and we assess that
relationship is the primary reason for Yellow
Liderc’s interest in them. These include India-based
IT managed services providers (MSPs), financial
software and technology companies such as
enterprise resource planning (ERP) providers,
Middle East engineering and construction
companies, and business technology consultants.

Yellow Liderc
Yellow Liderc (a.k.a. Tortoiseshell) is an Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) aligned threat
actor, which PwC associates with a private sector
Iranian entity. The threat actor first came into
prominence in 2018, and remained active
throughout 2020, with infrastructure management
activities and intrusion operations aligning closely
to the standard Iranian Saturday to Thursday
working week. In contrast to 2019, where the threat
actor made more frequent use of its rudimentary
bespoke malware families and phishing campaigns,
2020 saw increased efforts to target key corporates
via social engineering across multiple social and
chat platforms.

Aviation, aerospace and
automotive
Targeting of engine manufacturers (e.g. turbofans,
aircraft engines and automotive engines), large
aerospace and defence manufacturers, and several
low cost European airlines.

Information
operations
Information operations often seek
to exploit existing societal divisions
or wider conspiracy theories in an
attempt to influence a narrative or
effect a desired outcome. They
may also exploit data that has been
exfiltrated as part of a cyber
espionage campaign. Social media
platforms in particular have come
under an increasing amount of
scrutiny over the type of
information that is propagated over
these channels, and the often lack
of robust scrutiny or challenge with
which this is done.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 20

Election interference
In relation to elections, the term ‘information
operations’ has often become synonymous with
‘election hacking’, although the latter encompasses
a wider array of activity including technical
compromises and disruption tactics. Interference
from Russia-based threat actors in the 2016 US
presidential election was a watershed moment in
the awareness of ‘election hacking’ and called into
question the robustness of democratic process.121
In October 2020, US national security officials
warned that both Iran and Russia had obtained
some voter registration data and were attempting
to sow ‘unrest’ ahead of the November 2020
presidential election, potentially by communicating
false information to registered voters.122 It was
indicated that Iran spread disinformation related to
the US presidential election by masquerading as a
far-right pro-Trump group to disseminate emails
designed to ‘intimidate voters and cause social
unrest’.123 In some cases, a ‘propaganda video’ was
used to perpetuate rumours of manipulation
concerning the mail-in vote process. It is important
to note there was no indication that election
systems had been compromised as some voter
registration data was likely already available in the
public domain or potentially leaked in previous
unrelated breaches.
A related advisory124 from the US Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicated that
an unnamed Iran-based threat actor, which we
track as Yellow Dev 19, exploited US state
websites, including election-related websites, in an
attempt to obtain voter registration information. The
threat actor reportedly used Acunetix vulnerability
scanner, a web security scanning tool, and
leveraged known vulnerabilities including SQL
injections, webshell uploads, and what the
advisory describes as ‘unique flaws’ against
targeted websites.

Although we have not seen a repeat of the 2016
activity, the impact of such influence or sabotage
operations on democratic process, and in
particular the role that social media platforms play
in this, is likely to remain under scrutiny in
the future.

COVID-19
In addition to some of the malicious cyber
campaigns that have targeted organisations or
sectors involved in the fight against COVID-19, as
outlined in the earlier section of this report, there
has also been a deluge of both misinformation and
disinformation related to the pandemic. Such
activity has included state-sponsored information
operations interacting with organic communities of
online users to spread disinformation, validating
already existing ill-formed and ill-informed
contrarian opinions.125
On one hand, in 2020 we saw misinformation being
shared online in the form of misleading statistics,
healthcare information, potential cures or
treatment, origins of the outbreak, and authorities’
responses to the pandemic. This also extended to
conspiracy theories, such as that the roll-out of 5G
technology being linked to the virus’ spread. We
also saw disinformation likely aimed at disrupting
public order or manipulating an agenda,
capitalising on recent events. The motivation
behind this could range from economic gain, such
as online scams, to political purposes. For
example, a European task force that tracks
disinformation released a report126 in June 2020
that examined how a Russian media contractor was
surreptitiously pushing out disinformation to other
European websites.127

Blurring the
lines
For the majority of threat actors,
their activities, however varied,
broadly align to a single
overarching motivation, be that
intelligence gathering or financial
gain. Of course, there have always
been those that buck the trend –
North Korea-based threat actors
are a prime example of this having
previously conducted espionage,
crime, sabotage and hacktivist
activities in line with shifting
strategic objectives. Over recent
years, there has been an increasing
overlap in the activity of long
standing espionage threat actors
being linked to financially motivated
activity, as a result of shifting
objectives or personal gain.
Hacker-for-hire operations have
also blurred the traditional
understanding of espionage
activities, where activity conducted
for multiple end users may be
performed by a single private
entity. Whilst this type of activity is
not new, 2020 saw a number of
such operations exposed in the
public domain.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 22

Espionage heart, criminal mind
In a continuing trend, an increasing number of
threat actors portray dual motivations – seemingly
using their tradecraft to conduct both espionage
and financially motivated activity. In a divergence
from 2019, throughout 2020 we observed more
activity that is likely being conducted for personal
gain as opposed to a wider shift in operational
objectives to generate revenue. This poses an
increasing threat to a wide variety of sectors and
organisations as the targeting does not necessarily
align to what is expected, nor does the tooling align
to traditional cyber crime activity. This widely
varying range of TTPs complicates both defence
and attribution efforts.

Geryon (a.k.a. Rocket Kitten) and Yellow Dev 15
had used their offensive tradecraft for personal
financial gain, often attempting to extort the
victim after stealing sensitive information from
them.131,132 We assess the motivations behind
these multiple cases of Iran-based threat actors
conducting both espionage and criminal
operations stems from the conditions within
which the threat actors operate, where ‘only the
best individuals or teams succeed, are paid,
and remain in business.’ These conditions
subsequently drive threat actors, less able to
compete, to seek out alternative or
supplementary sources of income.134
•

North Korean activity groups continued to
conduct a blend of espionage and financially
motivated attacks in 2020. Black Banshee and
Black Artemis have been observed targeting
organisations in the financial services sector,
including cryptocurrency exchanges.135 This
type of dual-hat activity has become fairly
typical,136 and is relatively unique in that the
revenue generated from these criminal
intrusions is assessed to likely fuel the North
Korean state’s strategic aims, rather than being
conducted for personal gain.137,138

•

Pakistan-based Gorgon Group (a.k.a. Aggah),
which PwC assesses to be the cyber crime
focussed element of the dual-motivated threat
actor Green Havildar, was extremely active in
2020, using a number of malicious PowerPoint
and Excel documents in order to target
numerous victims across the world.139 This
threat actor has a preference for commodity
malware such as AgentTesla, which it can use
for both espionage and criminal activities (i.e.
information collection on the target, or
intellectual property theft to later be sold on the
Dark Web).

Activity of this sort that emerged in 2020 is
associated with threat actors emanating from
multiple regions:
•

Several individuals tied to China-based threat
actor Red Kelpie were observed conducting
cyber attacks targeting over 100 victim
organisations across multiple sectors. The
intent behind these attacks was to not just steal
source code and customer account information,
but to also create access for deployment of
further payloads expressly for personal financial
gain, such as ransomware and cryptojacking
schemes.128,129

•

An individual thought to be tied to the Russiabased threat actor Blue Echidna (a.k.a.
Sandworm, Voodoo Bear) was found to be
engaging in spear phishing campaigns for
personal profit, targeting numerous sectors
including asset and wealth management, retail
and cryptocurrency.130

•

PwC’s research into Iran-based criminal
activities revealed a number of overlaps
between individuals connected to both criminal
operations and Iran-based espionage threat
actors. Indictments released in 2020 indicated
several individuals associated with Yellow

Hacker-for-hire groups
Mercenary espionage groups, more commonly
known as hackers-for-hire, offer different
challenges to the cyber security community than
standard espionage threats, despite deploying
similar TTPs to their nation-state counterparts.
These include:
• Unpredictability in targeting – whilst threat
intelligence teams are able to build up profiles
of nation-state groups based on their country of
origin and political events affecting it, hackerfor-hire groups follow the money. Their targeting
is dependent on their client base, which has the
potential to be broad with no particular focus on
any sector; and,
• Attribution – the ultimate client and objective
behind any activity observed is more difficult to
determine compared to activity from a
traditional threat actor.
Hacker-for-hire activities uncovered in 2020 have
revealed insights into how these groups operate.
This activity includes:
Private intelligence companies CyberRoot and
BellTroX (a.k.a. Orange Abtu, Amanda Lovers) were
placed squarely in the middle of a lawsuit accusing
them of compromising and stealing sensitive
information of an American businessman for a
client based in the Middle East.140 BellTroX has
separately also been found to have conducted
operations on hundreds of individuals and
organisations on behalf of other clients.141 PwC’s
analysis was able to not only tie CyberRoot and
BellTroX together, but also find links to another
group: Appin Security Group, which is suspected to
have been responsible for the 2013 attack on a

Norwegian telecommunications company.142 The
findings outline a string of newly created private
security organisations operating out of India,
conducting hacker-for-hire espionage operations
against a variety of sectors on behalf of clients.143
This illustrates that despite operations being
ousted, these hacker-for-hire groups are adaptive,
and will more often than not find a way to restart
their campaigns.
DeathStalker APT has been active since at least
as early as 2018 and increased the number and
diversity of its operations in 2020.144 It operates
several bespoke malware families which allows it to
conduct stealthy corporate espionage operations
for clients on a large scale creating new backdoors
in order to increase their capabilities.145
Deathstalker’s malware has been found in
numerous countries, with the threat actor mostly
focusing on targets within the financial and
legal sectors.
CostaRico APT has targeted organisations across
several continents and a variety of sectors, with a
heavy focus on South Asia. The origins of this
group remain elusive, but with a number of
relatively advanced defence evasion techniques
(such as creating multiple SSH tunnels on a victim’s
machine) as well as a bespoke backdoor –
SombRAT – this threat actor can be considered a
sophisticated cyber mercenary group. 146 Research
of the infrastructure used for SombRAT
communications suggests the campaigns started
at least as early as November 2019, and appear to
still be ongoing.147

Cyber
crime
The year of COVID
(and ransomware)
In last year’s report, we noted that
PwC’s Incident Response team
responded to multiple cyber
attacks affecting a range of
different industry sectors. The
overwhelming majority, 71% of
incidents, were the result of
criminal threat actors. 2020 was no
different, with 86% attributable to
cyber criminals.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 26

While ransomware was a major threat in 2019, it has dominated the headlines in the last 12 months, largely
due to a major shift in the TTPs employed by multiple ransomware threat actors:

Many threat actors now
exfiltrate data from their
victims before they encrypt
their victims’ files.

Of those which do exfiltrate
data, many announce that
they have compromised a
victim on a leak site
(typically hosted on the
dark web) and provide
‘proofs’ that they have
downloaded data from
their victims.

These threat actors set a
deadline by which a ransom
must be paid. If the victim
refuses to pay, stolen data
is published on the leak
site, adding data protection
and regulatory issues to the
challenges of restoring
operations.

This is in marked contrast to ransomware operations last year, which were largely conducted in secret.
The use of leak sites has almost certainly achieved its objective of increasing the pressure on victims to
pay ransom demands. It has also provided a clear insight into the operational tempo of many ransomware
operations. The scale and intensity of ransomware incidents in 2020 was striking, making ransomware the
most significant cyber security threat faced by organisations, irrespective of their industry sector
or location.

What is driving the growth
in attacks?
Profit
There was a sharp increase in the number of
ransomware actors in 2020, following a trend
already established in 2019. This was likely the
result of high profile ransomware incidents and, in
cases where details of ransom payments entered
the public domain, the perceived profitability of
human-operated ransomware attacks. This is
attracting new players into the market. Recent
arrivals include the ransomware systems such as
Darkside, SunCrypt, Egregor, and Everest.
The growth in ransomware operations is not
confined to new threat actors. Many established
criminal groups have already added ransomware to
their portfolios. Banking trojans such as Emotet,
Dridex and TrickBot are now more commonly used
as the initial delivery mechanism in targeted
ransomware attacks. The threat actor which we
track as White Austaras (a.k.a.TA505) introduced
CL0P ransomware at the end of 2019. The latest
threat actor to make this switch is White Horoja,
which controls the banking trojan Qakbot. Since
March 2020, Qakbot has been used in the delivery
of ProLock and DoppelPaymer ransomware and
most recently, Egregor.148
The shift by established criminal actors towards
ransomware is likely driven by opportunity costs.
Successful online banking attacks rely on complex
money laundering operations to receive stolen
funds and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts
under criminal control. The specialist criminals who
provide money laundering services demand high
commissions, whereas ransom payments are
usually paid directly to cryptocurrency wallets
already controlled by the attackers. As a
consequence, ransomware operations are
almost certainly more profitable than online
banking attacks.

148

We assess that several of the most significant
ransomware threats, including Ryuk/Conti and
WastedLocker, continue to be run privately.
They are operated by criminal enterprises whose
leadership has been active for over a decade and
which comprise many of the most sophisticated
and experienced criminal actors we currently track.
These threat actors are largely secretive and no
longer participate in the criminal forums or
marketplaces frequented by less-established
actors. Instead, they either have all of the resources
they need in-house, or, where they do need to bring
in external expertise or recruit additional talent,
they employ private communication channels to do
so. Established players can draw on an extensive
list of trusted contacts they have accumulated over
their extensive criminal careers.

Case study
Netwalker ransomware incident

PwC’s Incident Response team responded to a Netwalker
ransomware incident where the threat actor gained access to the
victim’s network six weeks prior to the execution of the
ransomware. Its access was gained through the use of
compromised accounts to log in to external remote access
services which did not require multi-factor authentication. The
threat actor moved laterally through the environment by dumping
credentials from the operating system of compromised hosts
using Mimikatz, conducting network scans to identify targets and
hosts to pivot to as it went. Using this method, it was able to gain
access to a highly privileged account. The threat actor then was
able to use this access to disable antivirus software and execute
the Netwalker ransomware across the network. At the time, the
threat actor did not steal data and threaten to publish it on the
dark web, but it changed its tactics several months after this
attack, and future victims were not so ‘lucky’ to be affected by
‘only’ the ransomware itself.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 28

Scalability
While the number of threat actors has
increased, in some cases the scale and pace
of their operations have also grown. Many of
the ransomware threat actors we track,
including Sodinokibi, Nefilim, NetWalker and
Suncrypt, are run as affiliate programmes.149
The threat actors in control of the ransomware
are responsible for the development and
management of the malware. They provide
access to the ransomware to their affiliates
whose role is to conduct attacks. Ransom
payments are deposited by victims into
cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the
ransomware developer and then shared with
the affiliates in a pre-agreed profit sharing
arrangement. In the case of Sodinokibi, the
primary threat actor controls negotiations with
victims; much the same applies with Suncrypt
which claims to have a dedicated blackmail
team (команда по шантажу) to handle
ransom negotiations.
The revenue of affiliate programmes is derived
from the expertise of the affiliates involved in
compromising target networks. The larger the
number and the greater the skill of the recruits
to an affiliate programme, the more revenue
that programme will generate. This has
introduced a degree of competition to attract
skilled operatives, with rival threat actors
adopting different approaches to recruitment:
•

NetWalker has claimed its profit sharing
arrangements are more favourable than
rival affiliate programmes (including
Sodinokibi) and posted details of payouts
from successful attacks.150

•

When the threat actor in control of
Sodinokibi relaunched its recruitment
programme in September, it deposited the
equivalent of USD 1 million into a
cryptocurrency account linked to its profile
on a criminal forum where it recruits
affiliates. The threat actor claimed that the
deposit was proof of the success of the
Sodinokibi programme and the level of
accessible funds it had at its disposal.151

•

The same threat actor raised Sodinokibi’s
profile yet further by taking part in an
interview on a Russian-language social
media channel on 23 October, in which he
claimed that the ransomware operation had
netted USD 100 million in 12 months.152

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 29

Barriers to entry are dropping
In Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) schemes, the
developer sells access to the malware for a one-off
fee. The products are usually marketed as
‘builders’, in that the purchaser can configure the
ransomware through a graphic user interface (GUI)
which then compiles the malware into a working
binary. In addition to a one-off fee, some RaaS
schemes offer a subscription service which
provides users with ‘rebuilds’ to reduce antivirus
detections and/or updates when new features
become available.
RaaS schemes are sold on criminal marketplaces
and many are marketed as a better alternative to
affiliate programmes: after the initial purchase is
made, the threat actor keeps 100% of any revenue
generated from its attacks.153 RaaS schemes have
lowered the entry bar to ransomware operations as
all that is required to obtain a working malware
package is the funds to make the purchase and
access to the criminal marketplaces where they are
sold. Many of these packages are sold with
extensive ‘how to’ guides and tutorials posted on
social media platforms, meaning that relative
newcomers to cyber crime can obtain a working
capability without previous experience. To
complicate matters further, the source code for a
number of ransomware variants, including Dharma,
GandCrab and others, has been leaked and has
resulted in a proliferation of malware derivatives,
dubbed ‘Frankenstein code’ in criminal forums.
We assess that RaaS threat actors are more likely
to target small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), whereas affiliate programmes and private
ransomware operations are more likely to attack
larger organisations. This is because RaaS
customers often do not possess the requisite
skills needed to attack and exploit large,
complex networks.

Established actors have raised their game
Two of the most established and prominent
ransomware threat actors have upgraded their
systems in 2020. BitPaymer, a ransomware variant
operated by the threat actor with the self-styled
name ‘Evil Corp’ (a.k.a. the Dridex Group), was first
introduced in 2017.154

Figure 7 – The RANION RaaS is marketed on multiple
criminal forums

Although the threat actor added some incremental
improvements to the code, the core system has
remained largely unchanged since its introduction.
In 2020, ‘Evil Corp’ launched a new ransomware
project known as WastedLocker, which was
responsible for high profile attacks from the outset.
Unlike BitPaymer, which was partially derived from
the source code for the Dridex banking trojan,
WastedLocker was written from scratch.155
Ryuk, one of the most serious ransomware threats
to organisations, was first introduced in 2018. Ryuk
operations were at a high tempo throughout 2019,
which continued into Q1 2020. During this period,
Ryuk was mainly delivered by a combination of
Emotet and TrickBot. Ryuk then went through a
dormant phase and did not re-emerge until Q3
2020. In parallel with Ryuk’s dormant phase, a new
ransomware variant, Conti, emerged. Like
WastedLocker, Conti has been written from
scratch, but based on coding similarities and the
naming conventions used in files and commands,
we assess it has been written by the threat actor in
control of Ryuk.156 Ryuk’s apparent disappearance
during Q2 2020 prompted speculation that it had
been supplanted by Conti. However, by September
2020 Ryuk had re-emerged but had switched
delivery mechanisms to BazarLoader and
Buer loader.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 30

The development of new ransomware variants is
likely in response to improvements in defensive
security. Whether variants have been written from
scratch like Conti and WastedLocker, or
incremental improvements have been introduced to
established systems, there has been a drive to
enhance the speed of encryption routines and
defence evasion techniques. The intention of these
improvements is clear: to reduce the risk of
detection when the malware is first deployed on the
network and/or to ensure encryption routines
function as quickly as possible to prevent
disruption of an attack while it is still underway.

The changing face of ransomware
operations
As noted in the introduction, the advent of leak sites
became one of the most striking elements of the
ransomware phenomenon in 2020. Each time data is
exposed on a leak site it represents an attack that
failed to extort a ransom payment from a victim. It
would be dangerous to infer that such attacks have
had no impact; in many cases those incidents are
likely to have caused significant disruption.
Assessing the scale and tempo of ransomware
operations based on how frequently threat actors
expose stolen data on leak sites is inherently risky;
several sophisticated threat actors, including those
in control of Ryuk or WastedLocker, do not employ
leak sites at all. Nevertheless, in 2020 at least 25
different actors have joined the leak site bandwagon
since the first site was created by the actor in control
of Maze ransomware. Some, like Light ransomware,
have been short lived; others, have rebranded
themselves (e.g. AKO changed its name to Ranzy);

while others, such as Sodinokibi and DoppelPaymer
have been active throughout the year.
Since the beginning of the year, some 1,330 victims
have had their data exposed, with the
overwhelming majority (79%) of these leaks
occurring in the second half of the year. This
reflects the arrival of a series of aggressive
ransomware operations which has driven up the
number of incidents. But this figure belies the
changing fortunes of some of the most prominent
ransomware operations.
In the first half of 2020, the threat actors in control
of Maze and Sodinokibi were dominant, with new
arrivals to ransomware operations beginning to
make an impact.
By Q4 2020, many more threat actors were active,
with Egregor becoming one of the most prolific. The
sectors most frequently targeted were Retail &
Consumer and Manufacturing, although no sector is
immune to ransomware incidents.

Since the beginning of the year,
some 1,330 victims have had
their data exposed, with the
overwhelming majority (79%) of
these leaks occurring in the
second half of the year.

Case study
Nefilim ransomware incident

PwC’s Incident Response team responded to an
incident in which a threat actor was observed to
have gained access to the victim’s environment just
a week prior to the execution of a Nefilim
ransomware attack, with half of this time dedicated
to extracting files from the victim’s environment.
The threat actor’s initial access was through the
compromised credentials of a software vendor who
provided support to the victim for the vendor’s
application. These credentials were used to gain
access to the victim’s environment via a remote
access solution. Once inside, the threat actor
used Cobalt Strike to establish persistence and C2,
and used Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike to expand
its access and gain access to more
privileged accounts.

Having obtained privileged access, the threat actor
identified a file server of interest and used its
access to copy files from this server, stage them on
other compromised systems, and upload them to
cloud services controlled by the attacker. After
extracting this data, the threat actor executed the
ransomware, and threatened to publish the stolen
files online unless a ransom was paid. After a week
of non-payment, the victim’s executives were
threatened directly via email that the organisation’s
files would be released.

Case study
Multinational company compromised by ransomware attack

PwC’s Incident Response team responded to a
ransomware attack affecting a multinational client in
New Zealand. The attack saw the vast majority of its
systems encrypted and rendered inoperable, breaking
its supply chain, halting global manufacturing and
distribution, and putting its banking covenants at risk.
The threat actor had been active on the victim’s
systems from around 11th May 2020, based on
evidence we found of beaconing activity in firewall
logs, and the installation of tools such as ADFind and
other Privilege Escalation tools. The threat actor spent
the next couple of weeks exploring the client’s
network and data, with file staging activities beginning
on 27th May. Exfiltration to the AnonFiles file upload
site started on 28th May. Our investigation revealed
further installation of hacking tools on 30th May, with
staging activity ceasing on 31st May followed by
further exfiltration of the client’s data and the
ransomware deployment on 1st June. It was at this
point that PwC’s investigation, containment and
recovery activities began.

Working with our global teams it was rapidly
determined that the attackers were likely to be external
Russian speaking cybercriminals motivated by
financial gain. This determination was based on the
use of the Nefilim ransomware variant (based on
Nemty ransomware family which originated in August
2019) and other factors. This enabled us to guide the
client’s response in alignment with the threat actor’s
MO including the likely timeline and actions it would
take in terms of communication and posting the data
on its data dump site. The IoCs and threat intelligence
advisories were shared with relevant agencies and law
enforcement. This included the threat actor’s FTP
address and credentials which were discovered by
reconstructing a Windows Terminal server caching
bitmaps. Disk and log forensic analysis, along with
reverse engineering some of the file paths enabled us
to locate some of the data stored on the AnonFiles site
and reconstruct much of the staged data.

Delivery mechanisms

its spam and spear phishing campaigns up to
mid-February 2020, when White Taranis began to
initiate a powering down of its systems and spam
campaigns. These remained largely dormant until
mid-July 2020, when a sudden burst of Emotet
activity once again flooded the scene.157

Although ransomware infections captured the
headlines within the cyber crime scene in 2020, a
powerful ally to the threat actors were the delivery
systems used to drop their malicious payloads.
Malware delivery systems are pieces of software
specifically designed to house malicious payloads,
which are dropped by threat actors in order to gain
an initial entry onto a target system. PwC observed
a range of delivery systems in 2020, which are
currently in play by several cyber criminal
threat actors. These have included affiliate based
systems, developed to allow access to a number of
entities, through to off-the-shelf systems, which
can be acquired through online private forums for a
fee. Each played a crucial role in 2020 in aiding
cyber criminal threat actors within their malicious
campaigns. The year also saw the rebirth of certain
systems that had been dormant for many years, as
well as new systems entering the market to offer a
fresh alternative to the pre-established delivery
system players.

Emotet ups and downs
At the start of the year Emotet, which PwC tracks
as White Taranis, continued to follow its form from
the end of 2019, with its consistent delivery of both

Spam campaigns by Epoch 2, the threat actor’s
primary spam delivery botnet, were confined to the
delivery of new Emotet binaries, rather than
secondary payloads, such as TrickBot or Ursnif,
which have been previously witnessed by PwC.158
This was closely followed by the threat actor’s other
spam delivery botnet servers Epoch 1 and Epoch 3.
The choice to solely deliver Emotet is likely to be part
of a replenishment scheme by the threat actor to
deploy the latest version of the Emotet binary on its
stock of infected hosts, as part of a return to fullscale malware delivery operations. White Taranis has
been frequently observed to take extensive ‘breaks’
in activity throughout its years of operation, and
these have affected the loyalty of its client base. 2020
was no exception – during its break, clients of the
Emotet delivery system were forced to make other
arrangements due to its absence. This saw the
popularity of systems such as Qakbot and Buer
loader increase as alternatives to Emotet.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 34

Alongside Emotet email and spear phishing
campaigns, PwC also observed small developments
being made to the Emotet binary that was being
delivered during Q1 2020. This included a new
Emotet module specifically designed to propagate
over unsecured WiFi networks.159 The module added
both scanning and brute-forcing capabilities which
significantly improve Emotet’s ability to further
compromise hosts on an infected network.

Qakbot still quacking
The threat actor that PwC tracks as White Horoja is
behind the banking trojan named Qakbot (Qbot),
which in 2020 was used to deliver a range of
ransomware operations. First seen in 2007 targeting
organisations within the finance sector, White Horoja
took an extended break before returning to the
scene in 2016 with a host of new developments and
updates to improve both its capabilities and
operational effectiveness.160 In 2020, PwC witnessed
a spike in White Horoja activity resulting in an
increase in spam emails delivering the banking
trojan itself. This was further coupled with a number
of high-profile ransomware cases that recorded the
use of Qakbot within their infection process.
Noticeable ransomware operations including
Egregor, Prolock and DoppelPaymer have all used
Qakbot as a delivery mechanism from at least Q2
2020 onwards.161,162 One of the reasons for this is
likely due to the ‘break’ Emotet took between
February and July 2020.
Qakbot spam campaigns employed a tried and
tested technique, used by White Horoja, of acquiring
compromised WordPress websites and malicious
Word documents to pull down and execute Qakbot.

This proved to be an effective method to ensure that
an instance of Qakbot would be running on a victim
machine. Victims of Qakbot within 2020 covered a
range of sectors including education, finance,
healthcare, government and manufacturing across
North America and Western Europe.163 Interestingly,
one of the innovations adopted by Qakbot in 2020
was the introduction of a mail stealer module, which
enabled White Horoja to distribute Qakbot via ‘reply
to’ attacks from already infected hosts. This
technique was used extensively by Emotet in 2019
and is likely to be highly effective; recipients of emails
are more likely to open malicious attachments and
enable content if they have received a message from
a known contact in an existing email thread. When
Emotet returned in July 2020, Qakbot resumed
delivery by Emotet itself, which led to another
eventual spike in Qakbot activity as Emotet spam
campaigns began to power-up.
A key feature of a number of Qakbot-leveraged
ransomware attacks has been the use of an instance
of Cobalt Strike, which employs a distinctive set of
domains for C2. First observed in attacks deploying
DoppelPaymer in Q2 2020, the Cobalt Strike C2 was
hard coded to connect to domains impersonating a
major cloud service and distributed computing
service. Attacks delivered by Qakbot later in the year
again used the same naming patterns for Cobalt
Strike C2s, but were now dropping Egregor instead
of DoppelPaymer. It is unclear if this distinctive use
of Cobalt Strike can be attributed to a threat actor
which has had access to both DoppelPaymer and
Egregor, or if this is a feature of White Horoja’s
Access-as-a-Service operation.164

Buer Loader
Alongside the activity observed by some of the major players within the delivery system scene, PwC also witnessed increased
activity from some of the lesser-known loaders delivering high-profile ransomware systems. Loaders such as Buer Loader,
which was first introduced in August 2019, came to prominence in 2020, when it was selected to be used in a number of White
Onibi campaigns, the threat actors behind Ryuk ransomware. Buer Loader provided an alternative option to threat actors as a
delivery system that harnesses the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. This model allows users on the Russian-speaking
criminal forum Exploit.in the opportunity to purchase the loader for a base price of USD 400. Advertised as a ‘modular’ loader,
Buer was also consistently supported throughout the year by its developers. With multiple updates and iterations released by
the authors, with a focus on improving its defensive evasions capabilities, in an attempt to reduce the number of antivirus
detections for the loader. This helped enhance the loader’s attractiveness to the delivery system market, as a reliable and
easily accessible loader compared to its more exclusive alternatives.165
Furthermore, with Emotet taking a brief departure during Q2 of 2020, Buer Loader popularity once again increased.
As it was also observed to be used by White Magician (a.k.a. TrickBot) in a number of campaigns, which further cements
this assessment.166

Bazar and TrickBot

Maze: rise and fall

TrickBot continued to have a consistent year of
activity throughout 2020. At the start of the year,
PwC observed the banking trojan making
numerous updates and additions to several of its
custom modules. These modules are designed to
provide TrickBot with a range of interchangeable
functionalities, including the ability to scan for
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services or bypass
User Access Controls (UAC) on Windows
systems.167 This showcased White Magician’s
commitment to improving and developing its
malware. In April 2020, this behaviour was further
solidified with the introduction of a new multi-stage
modular loader known as BazarBackdoor (a.k.a
Team9, BazaLoader, KEGTAP).168 The malware itself
shares much of its operational and technical
capabilities with the pre-existing TrickBot trojan,
also developed by White Magician.169 However, we
witnessed the threat actor employing a novel
approach to C2 infrastructure, through the use of
the EmerDNS service on the Emercoin
blockchain.170 This new TTP for White Magician
allowed it to strengthen its C2 infrastructure and
prevent its domains from classic takedown and
sinkholing efforts. In September 2020, White Onibi,
the threat actor behind the Ryuk ransomware,
began using Bazar as a delivery mechanism for its
ransomware operations, leading to a noticeable
spike in Bazar spam and domains being created.171
PwC observed the threat actor focus targeting
large enterprises on a sector-agnostic basis, with
many of its campaign themes centred around
enterprise and business operations.

Maze is a cyber criminal threat actor that PwC
tracks as White Labyrinth. It is behind the Maze
ransomware operation that has been active since
March 2019. Since that time, PwC has observed a
dramatic increase in the level of activity by the
threat actor, especially within Q1 of 2020. This
period saw the threat actor target major
organisations and companies in what is called ‘big
game hunting’ in which organisations rather than
individual consumers are targeted in an attempt to
receive a greater return. These targeted
organisations lay across a selection of sectors such
as retail, healthcare, manufacturing and
insurance.172 This included several instances of
specific targeting against entities related to the
COVID-19 pandemic, including hospitals, vaccine
test centres and other organisations.173

TrickBot continued to
have a consistent year of
activity throughout
2020.

However, White Labyrinth’s most notable
contribution to 2020 was the fact that it pioneered
the growing trend of ransomware leak sites. It
became the first known threat actor to publicly
display compromised data on a website, in an
attempt to publicly exploit and apply pressure to
the victim organisation to pay the ransom demand.
The introduction of the Maze site sparked a
revolution within the ransomware scene with
multiple threat actors choosing to set up similar
sites to publicly extort victims. It was also used to
house victim data from other ransomware
operations including LockBit and Ragnar Locker.
By November 2020, White Labyrinth had released
data stolen from 256 victims, which PwC
approximates to one third of all data leaks in 2020,
making it one of the most prolific ransomware
operations to publicly expose stolen data.174
On 1st November 2020, White Labyrinth released a
press statement on its site declaring that it would
officially close down its project. This consisted of
the powering down the leak site used as well as the
halt in any new Maze ransomware infections. This
left a considerable gap within the ransomware
scene which was rapidly filled by the introduction of
a new system titled Egregor, which many deem as
the spiritual successor to the Maze operation.

Business Email Compromise:
continued persistence and
increasing sophistication
In 2019, we saw a rising trend of BEC attacks,
where a threat actor either hijacks or closely
imitates (‘spoofs’) a legitimate email account in
order to more effectively socially engineer
individuals into conducting fraudulent financial
transactions. BEC remained prevalent across all
industry sectors and business sizes in 2020.
According to the FBI, the increasing financial losses
of BEC attacks amounted to USD 1.7 billion in
2019,175 making it the highest grossing form of
internet crime that year. While the majority of BEC
attacks focus on economies of scale, seeking to
elicit smaller amounts from targets over multiple
campaigns,176 some threat actors have managed to
steal millions in a single attack.
BEC attacks have been becoming increasingly
sophisticated, employing a combination of tactics
such as display name deception, secure server and
domain name impersonation, vendor email
compromise (VEC) and person-in-the-middle attack
(PITM) techniques. In addition to social engineering,
security researchers have tracked the exponential
growth of commodity malware (keyloggers and
RATs) and phishing kit use among BEC actors
between 2014 and 2020 attesting to the continued
development of BEC TTPs to enhance persistence
and scale credential stealing capabilities.177

In November 2020, in a joint operation, INTERPOL,
Group-IB and Nigeria Police Force arrested three
individuals in Lagos, Nigeria accused of engaging
in BEC as well as developing and distributing at
least 26 variants of commodity malware, including
AgentTesla, Loki, Azorult, Spartan, NanoCore and
Remcos Remote Access Trojans.180
PwC has reported on the activities of 11 active
Nigeria-based threat actor groups,181 however, BEC
is also attracting more sophisticated financially
motivated threat actors, such as Russia-based
Cosmic Lynx. More than 200 campaigns against
targets in 46 countries have been attributed to the
Russia-based threat actor since 2019, and while on
average BEC attackers request approximately USD
55,000 from each target, Cosmic Lynx requests on
average USD 1.27 million.182 It is highly likely that
BEC will continue to be a highly attractive and
lucrative form of attack, especially in light of the
increased number of employees working from
home due to COVID-19 lockdown measures.
Remote working has led to changes in how many
businesses operate, with threat actors continuing
to capitalise on the climate of uncertainty.

The severity of BEC has prompted increased law
enforcement responses internationally, resulting in
a number of high-profile arrests in 2020. In June
2020, the arrests of Raymond ‘Hushpuppi’
Igbalode178 and Olalekan Jacob Ponle179 (a.k.a ‘Mr.
Woodberry’) drew mass media attention, after
criminal complaints against the individuals alleged
that their opulent lifestyles, which they flaunted
openly on social media to over 2.4 million followers,
were financed by the proceeds of online fraud.
Hushpuppi alone is alleged to have laundered
approximately USD 138 million from BEC attacks.

Case study
Norfund defrauded of NOK 100 million in Business Email Compromise183

On 16th March 2020, Norfund transferred USD
9,888,055 to a bank account in Banco Mercantil del
Norte, Mexico, which Norfund believed belonged to
its client, the Cambodian financial institution LOLC
Plc. In fact, the bank account was controlled by a
threat actor, which managed to compromise an
email account belonging to an employee at
Norfund, registered fake domains and
impersonated Norfund’s and LOLC’s employees
in the conversation.
Prior to the fraud, in September 2019, the threat
actor compromised an email account belonging to
an employee at Norfund, and monitored Norfund’s
communication for seven months. On 9th March
2020, the threat actor intercepted email
correspondence between Norfund and LOLC about
the forthcoming transaction. It changed the bank
account details in the disbursement notice and
convinced Norfund that a Mexican bank was used
to avoid using several bank intermediaries in
the transaction.

The threat actor used COVID-19 as a factor to
convince LOLC that the bank transfer was delayed.
At the same time, it sent emails to Norfund
confirming that the funds were received by LOLC,
to prevent further investigation on Norfund’s side.
On 24th April 2020, the threat actor tried to
manipulate a transaction with another Cambodian
client, First Finance Plc, asking to change the bank
account details to Banco Mercantil del Norte.
Norfund’s investment manager requested First
Finance to confirm the change and subsequently
received confirmation that the account did not
belong to them. On 30th April 2020, Norfund
received an email from LOLC stating that the bank
account details in the transfer on 16th March 2020
were incorrect. Following the discovery of the
attempted fraud, Norfund engaged PwC’s Incident
Response team to handle the incident in
cooperation with Norwegian law enforcement and
Norfund’s IT service provider.

Rise of the
defenders
As threat actors continued to
breach organisations in pursuit of
their objectives – and sometimes
monetised their access on the side
– public sector entities, legislative
branches and private sector
organisations have been
sharpening their cyber strategies
and coordinating their efforts to
tackle malicious cyber activity.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 40

Going public

Case study

During 2020, governments worldwide were
increasingly active in releasing information relating
to malicious cyber operations in the public domain.
This has taken many forms including the release of
reports detailing the TTPs of specific threat actors,
or commonly observed in intrusions against
specific sectors, or advisories detailing the
exploitation of specific vulnerabilities.

Norwegian Parliament breached by APT28

In particular, governments were increasingly open
to publicly attributing specific intrusions to foreign
entities. For example, the United Kingdom, Canada,
and the United States assessed earlier this year
that Russia-based threat actors part of Blue
Kitsune were responsible for targeting COVID-19
vaccine development.184 The associated advisory
detailed some of Blue Kitsune’s initial access
techniques and custom malware. In October, the
Norwegian government assessed that Russiabased threat actors were responsible for a breach
of the Norwegian Parliament’s email systems dating
back to August 2020,185 in a move that represented
the first time it had publicly attributed a cyber
incident to a state.

Legal action
Sanctions and indictments form an increasingly
prominent part of the strategy which is used to
deter and disrupt malicious cyber activity. The US
has been taking the lead in this space, continuing
to use these measures as a warning to those
attempting to conduct cyber attacks against the
country. Most notably, in September 2020, there
was a coordinated effort by several US
departments to disrupt Iran-based cyber activity.187
Over the course of a week, several indictments
were unsealed and sanctions brought against a
number of individuals who allegedly performed
malicious cyber activity associated with Iran’s
Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), and
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This
was combined with the release of technical alerts
and advisories regarding the TTPs of Iran-based
cyber activity.

In October 2020, it was made public that the Norwegian
Parliament (Stortinget) had fallen victim to an intrusion and the
Norwegian government took the historic step of publicly accusing
Russia of being behind the attack. At the time, the government
did not provide evidence, nor did it provide any details about
which Russia-based threat actor was responsible. The accusation
was historic, as it was the first time Norwegian government
officials pointed directly at another country following a breach.
Previously, these types of reactions had been reserved for
warning against Russia and China-based threats in the
intelligence and security services’ annual threat assessments.
On 8th December 2020, the Norwegian Police Security Service
issued a public statement following its investigation, indicating
that Russia-based threat actor Blue Athena was behind the
intrusion.186 The investigation showed that the threat actor had
bruteforced passwords to obtain valid usernames and passwords.
This technique had been used against a high number of user
accounts at Stortinget’s email systems and resulted in the threat
actor being able to obtain legitimate credentials, which it used to
log in to a smaller number of accounts. It was revealed that
sensitive information had been extracted from some of the
affected accounts. Furthermore, the investigation revealed that
the threat actor had attempted to move laterally into Stortinget’s
computer systems. However, there were no indications this had
been successful.

2020 also saw the European Council impose its first-ever round of restrictive sanctions (including a travel
ban and asset freezing) against multiple individuals and entities in response to different high-profile, global
cyber incidents.188 The campaigns and attacks explicitly referenced in the Council Decision included:

Operation Cloud Hopper,
the global espionage
campaign conducted by
Red Apollo (a.k.a. APT10),
which involved
‘unauthorised access to
commercially sensitive
data, resulting in significant
economic loss’.

A 2018 intrusion attempt
into the Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW) by Blue
Athena, ‘which, if
successful, would have
compromised the security
of the network and the
OPCW’s ongoing
investigatory work’ into the
Salisbury poisonings.

The public sector has not been alone in taking legal
action against cyber threat actors. Microsoft has
previously done so in order to take legal control of
domains associated with cyber threat activity. It
has legally seized infrastructure involved in
campaigns conducted by Red Kelpie,189 Blue
Athena,190 Yellow Garuda,191 as well as activity
spanning the intrusion sets PwC associates with
Black Shoggoth and Black Banshee.192 In 2020,
Microsoft also brought a legal case against threat
actors conducting a COVID-19-themed BEC
campaign targeting users of Microsoft’s
Office365 suite.193

A series of incidents
attributed to Black Artemis:
from the ‘WannaCry’
ransomware campaign; to
the intrusion against the
Polish Financial Supervision
Authority as well as the
financially-motivated
compromise of Bangladesh
Bank and Tien Phong Bank;
to the sabotage-motivated
compromise and
destructive attack launched
against Sony Pictures
Entertainment.

An operation to disrupt TrickBot was conducted by
the US Cyber Command in October 2020. The
techniques reportedly included compromising the
botnet’s C2 servers, and injecting junk data into
stolen data to render data unusable.194 Similarly,
Microsoft took action in conjunction with
telecommunications providers and other security
software vendors to cut off key infrastructure from
operators, disrupting their ability to perform new
infections or communicate with existing
compromised hosts, in particular, activating
ransomware.195 These actions have caused short
term disruption to TrickBot activity as it rebuilt and
recovered access to its infrastructure, and
effectively pushed it closer to Emotet, with which it
shares C2 infrastructure.

Vigilante subversion
In a variation of public entities’ takedown of cyber criminal
infrastructure, in July 2020 an unknown vigilante entity took
action to degrade the Emotet botnet’s operations for the space
of about a week. Publicly available research had noted that the
threat actor operating Emotet was using open-source webshells
– mostly with the same password – to control its botnet’s
compromised infrastructure and temporarily host payloads. The
vigilante entity was able to gain access to the webshells across
a portion of the Emotet botnet’s infrastructure, and moved to
replace malicious payloads and controller scripts hosted on it
with animated GIFs.

As ransomware activity continues to grow, the US
Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control’s (OFAC) warning against ransom payment
may serve to generate change. In October 2020,
OFAC warned US organisations of potential
sanction risks for facilitating ransom payments to
threat actors. It warned that organisations involved
in the facilitation chain, such as financial institutions
and insurance providers, may also be liable for
breaching sanctions.196
Whilst threat actors will ultimately continue to
conduct their operations, it is clear that the
takedown of key threat actor infrastructure can
cause significant disruption to their operations. The
release of a threat actor’s toolset may also trigger a
period of adjustment as they retool to avoid
detection, although we note that some threat
actors, such as those based in North Korea and
Iran have been seemingly unphased by similar
action in the past.

The series of defacements reportedly slowed down Emotet
operations temporarily, when the amount of hijacked
infrastructure reached about a quarter of its total payload
downloads.197

The effectiveness of indictments and sanctions on
deterring cyber operations is more difficult to
determine. Indictments against individual
operators, for example, are unlikely to result in
extradition, particularly where the activity is tasked
by the state. The effect of sanctions on ransom
payments however, may push cyber criminals to
reassess their methods going forwards if it
becomes unviable to meet payments. Both the
public and private sectors have grown increasingly
bold in attribution and in the willingness to share
information. At minimum, the attribution serves as a
warning that this activity has not gone unnoticed,
and when this information is brought into the public
domain, generates a greater awareness of the
cyber threat landscape, and a greater opportunity
for defence efforts.

Tools, Tactics
and Procedures
An endless supply... of
supply chain compromise
Supply chain compromise is not
new and, while less frequently
observed than other access paths,
such as credential compromise
and spear phishing, it remains a
critical intrusion vector into
organisations.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 44

To complicate prevention and detection efforts, supply chain compromise can take many different
forms, which can include one or more of the following examples:

Software compromise

Trusted infrastructure compromise

The alteration, replacement, or bundling of
legitimate software, such as installers or
updates, with malware that is delivered to
victims.

The compromise of legitimate websites or
applications, often in order to perform watering
hole attacks or to otherwise deliver malware to
targets.

Digital trust compromise

Third-party access compromise

The theft, forgery or abuse of valid digital
certificates to sign malware and bypass
detection mechanisms.

The case where a threat actor is able to breach
a trusted partner or supplier or contractor or
service provider of a target, and abuse the
entity’s access to the target’s network to
perform an intrusion.

Additionally, in some supply chain compromise incidents throughout 2020, analysis suggests the possibility
that multiple threat actors might have compromised the same ‘supplier’ entity contemporaneously or at
different times, which can complicate both the scoping, response, and attribution of incidents.

SolarWinds
In 2020, the SolarWinds compromise in particular
left 18,000 of its customers exposed, including
government entities.
In December 2020, FireEye and Microsoft released
research detailing a global supply chain
compromise affecting multiple sectors.198,199 The
threat actor, which PwC tracks as White Dev 61
(a.k.a. UNC2452), trojanised updates to SolarWind’s
Orion IT monitoring and management software,
modifying the ‘SolarWinds.Orion.Core.
BusinessLayer.dll’ component, to contain a
backdoor known as SUNBURST (a.k.a. Solorigate).
Multiple iterations of the Orion software were
affected from at least software version 2019.4 HF 5
to 2020.2.1 HF 1, released between March 2020
and June 2020.200

Our analysis, as well as multiple open source reports,
highlighted that the threat actor invested significant
effort in embedding SUNBURST into a legitimate
SolarWinds Orion DLL: creating a file which contains
both the SUNBURST payload and legitimate code
used in SolarWinds functionality, all signed by a
legitimate SolarWinds private key, across multiple
updates. The threat actor also took a number of
steps to blend in with legitimate activity and traffic of
the infected system and make analysis and detection
more difficult.201 In addition to masquerading HTTP
requests as legitimate Orion traffic or as benign XML,
and to using a custom JSON structure to
communicate with the C2, SUNBURST applied
execution delay, victim machine domain checking,
screening running processes and services against a
blocklist in an effort to avoid detection, command
and control IP checking, stopping antivirus and EDR
services, as well as other execution safeguards and
anti-analysis features.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 45

The malware has a wide range of capabilities.
A notable feature is the way it generates a unique set
of subdomains for the infected machine to connect to
for command and control. Part of the logic of the
custom domain generation algorithm (DGA)202 is used
initially to identify victim machines of interest to the
attacker. Specifically, SUNBURST determines the
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to which the
victim machine is registered, and uses this in the DGA
for subdomain generation, along with an eight byte
unique victim ID. If the FQDN domain record is empty
or null, the malware will exit, likely in an effort to avoid
executing on machines which are not part of an
intended target network.
Overall, the threat actor that developed SUNBURST
displayed a high level of technical sophistication,
having gone to great lengths to develop a stealthy
malware family able to clearly profile victims, and
deliver further payloads or exfiltrate information
from targets. Other than the notable scale of the
incident, and it remaining under the radar for
months, it is also worth pointing out that the
SolarWinds compromise was likely only one of
multiple methods used by the same threat actor to
gain access to targets.203

As the investigation into the SolarWinds
compromise continues, a follow-up report by
Microsoft also detailed the discovery of a separate,
different malware family from SUNBURST: a .NET
webshell that is known in open source as
SUPERNOVA.204 SUPERNOVA is designed to take a
valid .NET program as a parameter, and compile
and execute it in memory (leaving no forensic
traces on disk).205 While SUPERNOVA was also
delivered in the form of a maliciously altered
SolarWinds Orion component, it was not delivered
via the same vector as SUNBURST, and it has been
associated with a different threat actor from the
one deploying SUNBURST, adding further
complexity to the timelining, scope, and
consequences of the compromise as well as to its
attribution. We track SUPERNOVA activity under
White Dev 62.

Able Desktop
Another example of a long-running campaign abusing
the software supply chain is the compromise of Able
Desktop, a business management suite widely used
in Mongolia. In July 2020, we observed a sample of
an Able downloader bundled with a first stage loader
for the HyperBro backdoor.

In December 2020, Avast reported on Red Phoenix
(a.k.a. APT27, Emissary Panda) activity targeting the
Mongolian public sector, including by compromising
a company providing services to the Mongolian
government, and deploying HyperBro.206 An ESET
report also made a link between HyperBro and
targeting of Mongolia.207 Based on ESET’s analysis,
between at least 2018 and 2020, both trojanised Able
Desktop installers and compromised Able Desktop
updates were used by threat actors to deliver multiple
different malware families to targets. These included:

1

HyperBro, as observed by both PwC and Avast;

2

PlugX, a backdoor shared between multiple China-based threat actors; and,

3

TManger, a backdoor recently detailed in a series of posts by NTTSecurity208 and attributed
to Red Orthrus (a.k.a. Keyboy).

At the moment, it is unclear whether the same threat actor abused the Able compromise to deliver both
HyperBro, PlugX, and TManger; whether Red Phoenix and Red Orthrus shared access to the victim; or,
whether Red Phoenix and Red Orthrus separately compromised Able and abused their access to
target Mongolia.

VeraPort
In November 2020, ESET also reported that Black
Artemis was conducting a supply chain compromise
campaign abusing WIZVERA VeraPort software.209
VeraPort is used to manage software integration
installation, and is necessary in order to access some
South Korean government websites. Upon visiting
websites or applications also running VeraPort,
VeraPort users automatically receive and install any
component that may be required by such sites.
The threat actor reportedly compromised
individual legitimate websites supporting VeraPort,
altering the hosted VeraPort software package to
include malware.

Thereafter, VeraPort users visiting the
compromised websites would receive malware
similar to that described by KR-CERT in Operation
BookCode reports.210
Black Artemis also used stolen valid digital
certificates to sign the malicious binaries delivered to
victims, in order to bypass VeraPort’s default-enabled
execution safeguards, as the software would only
allow the installation of binaries signed with valid
certificates but not verify who the certificates had
been issued to. In our 2019 Year in Retrospect report,
we had specifically highlighted that we had observed
Black Artemis and its subset Andriel frequently use
stolen digital certificates in its operations,211 a
technique that the threat actor continues to apply.

Case study
Multiple threat actors target a maritime technology company

In April 2020, PwC’s Incident Response team
responded to an intrusion at a Nordic maritime and
subsea technology company. The client had been
devastated by ransomware, which had affected
most of its critical IT systems. The threat actor that
launched the attack made efforts to delete backups
as well as log data. This made it challenging to
pursue its activities. Shortly after the breach, the
threat actor demanded USD 210,000 in exchange
for decryption software. The victim did not pay
the ransom.

The China-based threat actor Red Kelpie had
deployed a custom proprietary backdoor identified
as SPECULOOS. The command-and-control
portion of this implant abused functionality in the
TLS 1.0 Client Hello handshake packet, making it
appear to be requesting a legitimate Microsoft
service in the Server Name Indication (SNI) field,
while in reality reaching out to a non-associated IP
address. At the time, the technique was novel, and
suggests that the threat actor made significant
efforts to make the handshake look innocuous.

The investigation concluded that the threat actor
had highly likely leveraged a Citrix NetScaler
appliance vulnerable to CVE-2019-19781 as its
entry point, deploying Cobalt Strike as its
command-and-control tool, before deploying the
ransomware family Defray777 (also known as
RansomEXX, 777 and Target777). While PwC was
unable to attribute the ransomware incident to a
known threat actor, our investigation uncovered
evidence that the same appliance highly likely had
been compromised by two other threat actors prior
to the ransomware incident.

Prior to this intrusion, the Iran-based threat actor
Yellow Dev 15 deployed a webshell framework on
the same appliance. Yellow Dev 15 is reportedly
known to sell access post-compromise to cyber
criminals, after its own actions and objectives are
achieved, which often align with Iran’s strategic
objectives. However, the FBI assesses the threat
actor has both capability and intent to deploy
ransomware. The intrusion remains an interesting
example of how organisations developing dual-use
technologies can find themselves in the crosshairs
of multiple resourceful threat actors.

Remote working: victims
and threat actors

intrusions. This is also partly due to several critical
vulnerabilities being uncovered in enterprise software
in 2020212,213,214,215 and several critical ones from both
2019 and 2018 remaining unpatched.216,217,218,219

Virtual Private Network (VPN) software, enterprise
remote access and virtualisation software have
doubtlessly been fundamental in the shift to flexible or
fully-remote work following the COVID-19 outbreak.
While they have long been a key target for threat
actors determined to gain access to victim networks,
VPNs and remote access products have really come
in the crosshairs of attackers in 2020, being exploited
both in espionage motivated and financially motivated

Actual vulnerabilities in software have combined with
ever-continuing phishing activity, and with the human
factor – more relevant than ever in 2020, with often
more isolated and fatigued personnel – into a highly
exposed attack surface, especially when it comes to
remote authentication and access.

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 48

Threat actors will inevitably capitalise on the
situation to conduct their attacks. In some cases,
we have seen multiple threat actors exploiting the
same known vulnerability to gain access to an
organisation’s estate.
Multiple threat actors, such as Red Kelpie, have
continued to exploit existing vulnerabilities in VPNs as
well as other remote access and enterprise
software,220 such as PulseSecure and Citrix, while
also working to include newly disclosed ones, for
example CVE-2020-10189 (a Remote Code Execution
vulnerability in ManageEngine Desktop Central).221,222
US CERT also reported that in some cases, Red
Kelpie deployed the legitimate VPN software
SoftEther to facilitate follow-on access to victim
networks. Multiple other China-based threat actors
have also been targeting VPN vulnerabilities, as
detailed in a US National Security Agency (NSA)
advisory released in October 2020.223
PwC also analysed some of Yellow Nix’s attack
sequences, noting the threat actor’s agility in rapidly
moving to exploit newly-released vulnerabilities.224
About one week after a public proof of concept
exploit for the vulnerability was released, for example,
Microsoft Security Intelligence reported that Yellow
Nix had started exploiting Zerologon (CVE-20201472).225 In some cases, Yellow Nix also exploited
CVE-2020-0688, a remote code execution
vulnerability affecting Microsoft Exchange mail server
software, as well as known Outlook Web Access
(OWA) vulnerabilities.226 US CERT also issued an
alert, in September 2020, about the ongoing
exploitation of VPN vulnerabilities by the Iran-based
threat actor Yellow Dev 15.227 We have investigated
several incidents involving this dual motivated threat
actor, whose exploitation of network appliances is a
technique which distinguishes it from other Iranbased sets.

Finally, an NCSC advisory detailed Blue Kitsune’s
exploitation of Sangfor VPN software.228 After
compromising Sangfor VPN servers, Blue Kitsune
was able to deliver the SOREFANG229 victim profiler
and downloader to victims in place of the legitimate
Sangfor update, abusing the fact that the VPN
clients did not verify the integrity of the updates. In
late October 2020, US CISA also reported that
another Russia-based threat actor, that PwC tracks
as Blue Kraken (a.k.a. Dragonfly, Havex), was also
abusing Cisco AnyConnect SSL VPN connections
for remote logins on victim networks along with
other mailing software vulnerabilities such as in
Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-2020-0688).230
However, it is important to note that financiallymotivated cyber criminal threat actors, too, have been
targeting enterprises via VPN software and remote
connections, in addition to the spam operations we
detailed earlier in this report. While unsecured RDP
has consistently been an initial access vector in
intrusions, including ones ultimately deploying
ransomware, ransomware affiliates have also been
targeting VPN software as an entry point into
networks. Public reports have indicated that a
vulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery
Controller (CVE-2019-19781) was the entry point in
intrusions leading to ransomware infections with
Sodinokibi, DoppelPaymer, CL0P or Nefilim, while
Sodinokibi and Ryuk also used a vulnerability in Pulse
Connect Secure (CVE-2019-11510).
VPN software is implemented by enterprises in order to
guarantee secure remote access, but it can turn into a
direct entry point into victim networks if valid VPN
credentials are compromised or if the software is not
adequately patched. This is the case both for recently
disclosed, as well as previously known vulnerabilities,
as public bodies, as well as private security
companies, have pointed out in multiple advisories in
the past year. Ultimately, this kind of exploitation is
highly likely to persist – and to lead to both espionagemotivated as well as financially-motivated compromise
– so long as systems remain unpatched.

Social engineering
Social engineering involves either the convincing or coercing of targets to gain their trust and ultimately carry
out a specific action. More often than not, this technique is essential to the effective execution of the threat
actor’s attack process. Whilst social engineering is by no means a new technique, 2020 saw threat actors
perfecting their techniques and becoming more bold in engaging with their targets. Social media platforms are
now not only used for reconnaissance but also increasingly leveraged to interact with targets across multiple
services, a move which reflects the changing methods by which people interact today.
As part of its ShowState
campaign, Black Artemis used
LinkedIn to perform both
reconnaissance and create fake
profiles to masquerade as a HR
recruiter, building trust with the
victim, sometimes over weeks or
months of interaction. Once this
had been established, the
communication reportedly
transferred alternate means of
contact including WhatsApp,
email, and even phone calls,
before delivering malware.

Yellow Garuda has utilised social
engineering techniques to great
effect over a number of years. In
a campaign uncovered in August
2020,231 the threat actor used a
fake journalist persona to
converse with targets over
multiple mediums including
email, WhatsApp and LinkedIn. It
even reportedly used WhatsApp
to initiate voice calls with its
targets, a technique we have not
seen the threat actor use before.

Case study
Multiple threat actors target an organisation in the transport sector
In September 2020, PwC’s Incident Response team
responded to an incident affecting an organisation in
the transport sector. The client had been notified by
local law enforcement that its external facing Citrix
NetScaler devices may have been compromised by
an Iran-based threat actor. Following our
investigation, it was found that an unpatched
vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler systems
(CVE-2019-19781) was likely exploited multiple times
by unrelated threat actors between January and
September 2020.

In February 2020, following a successful
exploitation of the vulnerability, a custom backdoor
known as SPECULOOS was placed on a second
NetScaler device, likely allowing for remote access to
the system.

This is the same vulnerability that was exploited in the
compromise of the maritime technology company
discussed in an earlier case study. Although an
entirely separate incident, there were overlaps in the
threat actors exploiting the vulnerability and the
techniques they were observed to use.

Threat actor activity attributed to Yellow Dev 15 was
observed between July and September 2020. In July
2020, it placed a web-based backdoor (webshell) on
both NetScaler devices following successful
exploitation of the Citrix vulnerability, allowing it to
remotely execute commands. The threat actor was
able to exploit an unsecure LDAP connection to
harvest credentials, gaining access to Domain
Administrator level privileges. It was able to move
laterally and performed internal reconnaissance
leveraging native Windows tools including PsExec
and the Director Service Internals suite, which it
installed using PowerShell and used to extract
credentials from the Active Directory.

The first known exploitation occurred in January
2020, where an unknown threat actor gained access
to an internet facing NetScaler device in activity
consistent with the general scanning and exploitation
of the Citrix vulnerability. There was no evidence of
any further malicious activity from this threat actor.

231

Later that same month, a different version of the
same backdoor was placed on the first NetScaler
device. Based on the timing of the activity and known
TTPs, this activity was likely related to Red Kelpie,
which has been previously seen to target this
vulnerability across multiple sectors.

MITRE ATT&CK techniques
The MITRE ATT&CK matrices232 provide a model to describe a threat actor’s tactics and techniques
across different environments. The following table highlights the most common techniques we saw
being used in 2020.

Tactic

Technique

Initial
Access

T1566 – Phishing
Phishing, whether through an attachment, link or via a service, remains one of the most
common initial attack vectors utilised by threat actors. Timely lures concerning real-world
events are often effective in piquing the interest of the target. In 2020, the onset of
COVID-19 allowed many threat actors to readily take advantage of the uncertainty
surrounding the pandemic, and PwC saw multiple threat actors utilising it as a theme.

T1133 – External Remote Services
Threat actors have continued to be adept at making use of disclosed vulnerabilities and
incorporating new techniques into their arsenal. The compromise of remote services has
come under greater focus in 2020 due to the increased reliance many organisations now
have on them. Red Kelpie, for example, has utilised the vulnerabilities within these
External Remote Services as a means to both gain and maintain initial access to its
target’s networks, as well as deliver its final payloads to victim machines.233

T1195 – Supply Chain Compromise
The targeting of entities within the supply chain has become a way for threat actors to gain
access to one or many targets exploiting a trusted relationship. 2020 saw a global supply
chain compromise which exploited a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion business
software to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor known as SUNBURST. 234
Execution

T1204 – User Execution
User execution is a technique utilised in almost every campaign, with threat actors
coercing the victim in one way or another to play a part in the attack process. Most
commonly, in activating malware by getting the user to execute a malicious file or
enable macros on their system. For example, Yellow Nix often uses a macro delivery
system with a generic lure asking the user to enable macros to view the file contents.
This action however, enables malicious code to run in the background.235, 236

T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter
The use of common interfaces and scripting languages provides threat actors with a
means of ensuring their malware executes successfully on different environments. On
Windows operating systems, the use of PowerShell commands is particularly popular. For
example, Blue Python has used PowerShell in a number of campaigns, both as a method
of compiling and injecting its later stage payloads onto disk; such as ComRAT,237 as well
as being used for executing commands on the victim’s system.238

Tactic

Technique

Persistence

T1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:
Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder
There are a number of techniques threat actors can use to maintain persistence, but the
most common we see are the use of run registry keys or other startup mechanisms that
mean the malicious payload will survive a system reboot. Such examples include variants
of Red Phoenix’s HyperBro backdoor, which not only has the option to append the
malware to the Run registry key if certain conditions are met, but has multiple other
means to achieve the end goal of persistence.239

Privilege
Escalation

T1068 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

Defence
Evasion

T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information

One means of privilege escalation is through the exploitation of either a known or
unknown (zero day) software vulnerability. Yellow Nix exploited CVE-2020-1472 – known
as Zerologon – which concerns the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). Using this
exploit, Yellow Nix was able to escalate its privileges to that of a domain administrator.240

Many threat actors will attempt to disguise their malware or communication through
obfuscation, making it more difficult to identify and potentially analyse. This technique is
used by most threat actors, although 2020 has seen some novel uses of it, such as Blue
Python’s updated .NET obfuscator for their Kazuar malware. This used a large switch
statement within the binary in order to make particular character substitutions.241

T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
Complementary to T1027, obfuscated data will often need to be deobfuscated or
decoded prior to use. One example of this is in the use of the 8.t framework, which
several China-based threat actors continue to use. This is an RTF weaponiser technique
that uses OLE objects and a number of equation editor vulnerabilities in order to decode
and execute shellcode into a final malicious payload.242, 243, 244

T1036 – Masquerading
Masquerading is a common technique used by many threat actors as a means of
blending into a victim’s environment. In many cases, relatively simple techniques are
being used to effect. For example, we have seen Black Artemis mimicking antivirus
vendors in its filenames to disguise its BEEFEATER malware.245 Similarly, the use of icons
from legitimate applications is another common way of tricking victims into believing they
are opening a legitimate application. As part of an extensive campaign targeting users in
China, Orange Athos disguised malicious binaries using Microsoft Word, and icons
mimicking Tencent Cloud services and the Qihoo360 company logo.246

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 52

Tactic

Technique

Defence
Evasion

T1070.004 – Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion
The deletion of files on the victim’s system, whilst noisy, can prevent the victim from
being able to see the full chain of execution and removes indicators of compromise
from the victim’s machine. As such, it is a common technique used by multiple threat
actors. For example, we have seen several Poison Ivy campaigns that use specific
‘Loader’ executables that initially load the Poison Ivy payload, and then subsequently
delete itself and all trace of any initialisation.247

T1221 – Template Injection
Template injection is a way for threat actors to conceal their malicious code within
Office templates, usually through Office Open XML (OOXML) specifications. The
malicious code can subsequently be used to fetch and execute remote document
templates. One of the key exploiters of this technique in 2020 has been Blue Otso
(a.k.a. Gamaredon Group), which has conducted multiple campaigns using DOCX
files that use Office vulnerabilities in order to download and open a malicious
template document that contains malicious embedded macros.248
Credential
Access

T1056.001 – Keylogging
Keylogging is a technique that allows the threat actor to record the keystrokes of the
victim as they interact with their keyboard. For example, North Korea-based threat
actor Black Artemis (a.k.a. Lazarus Group) added an additional module to its already
established Dtrack malware to give it keylogging functionality.249

T1187 – Forced Authentication
This technique exploits baked-in protocols in Windows architecture. The threat actor
will usually take advantage of several authentication protocols in Windows networks
such as Server Message Block (SMB) and Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
(WebDAV), forcing the victim to provide authentication information which the threat
actor can intercept. We have observed this behaviour in 2020 being used by Blue
Kraken to exploit the SMB protocol, and inject code to grab the NTLM hashes of
victims across multiple sectors, but mainly focusing on the aviation sector in the
United States.250
Discovery

T1083 – File and Directory Discovery
In 2020, this technique has been consistently used by cyber crime groups, such as
White Mjolnir (a.k.a. Ragnar Locker)251 and Blue Lelantos (a.k.a. Dridex),252 to
enumerate and map their victim’s drives before extracting sensitive information. The
information collected is used to coerce the target into paying the ransomware that is
subsequently detonated on the target’s system, or it is sold on leak sites – a new,
insidious theme across cyber crime in 2020.

T1082 – System Information Discovery
Threat actors often seek detailed information about the victim’s operating system and
hardware such as system architecture, domain information and user data which the
threat actor can potentially later exploit. This technique has been used by multiple
threat actors, including Iran-based threat actor Yellow Liderc (a.k.a Tortoiseshell),
which was observed in 2020 utilising scripts to enumerate system information and
send it back to the threat actor.

Discovery

T1057 – Process Discovery
Understanding which processes are running on the target’s machine can be used to
determine a malware’s next steps, such as terminating specific processes that are
detrimental to its functionality, or terminating itself from the victim’s system. For
example, White Mjolnir’s strain of ransomware (a.k.a. Ragnar Locker) that will search
for and terminate specific processes running on the victim’s machine that it deems
crucial to its operation.253

Collection

T1005 – Data from Local System
The local system of a victim’s machine provides large amounts of information that is
useful to threat actors, such as file systems and local databases. We have observed Grey
Karkadann (a.k.a. APT-C-23, Desert Falcons) incorporating a number of functions into its
Pierogi malware which allow it to access data from the local system. For example,
creating file listings of the user directory, finding and exfiltrating files of a specified file
type and last modified date, and obtaining login data from specific browsers.254

Command
and Control

T1071 – Application Layer Protocol

Exfiltration

T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

One of the most popular ways of blending in with legitimate network traffic is to
communicate to the command and control (C2) server using application layer protocols.
There are multiple examples of this technique being used by threat actors, such as the
OceanMap256 and OceanDrive257 malware families that utilise either IMAP or Google Drive
storage for C2 communications, or Red Keres (a.k.a. APT31) utilising Dropbox for its
malware’s C2.258

The exfiltration of sensitive data is often the end goal of intelligence gathering activities
and using the existing C2 channel is a common means of doing so. 2020 has notably
seen this technique being adopted by the operators behind ransomware as they
increasingly look to incorporate data exfiltration as part of their attack process. Whilst the
encryption of data is still a key component of their operations, the widespread use of leak
sites has seen groups such as White Ursia (a.k.a. Sodinokibi), White Mjolnir (a.k.a. Ragnar
Locker), and White Onibi (a.k.a. Ryuk) all adopt the model of exfiltrating data over a C2,
whilst also detonating their ransomware on their way out. 259,260,261

Tactic

Technique

Impact

T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact
The encryption of data is a technique notorious to cyber criminal groups, which have
become increasingly more active and brazen in their targeting. Ransomware is used to
encrypt a victim’s system, often only after extracting sensitive information from those
directories. These sorts of attacks are more common than they have ever been, with 2020
seeing groups such as White Onibi (a.k.a. Ryuk), White Magician (a.k.a. TrickBot), and
White Horoja (a.k.a. Qakbot) having an extremely active year.

T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery
Preventing a victim from recovering their system is a common technique used by cyber
criminal groups, as a means of making sure the victim’s system remains permanently
damaged should they not meet the demands of the attacker. This technique is found in a
variety of ransomware families such as White Helios’ ransomware (a.k.a. Suncrypt) that
will delete the victim’s shadow volume copy.262

T1489 – Service Stop
Threat actors often attempt to disable services on a victim’s system to either cause
further damage to an environment, or prevent the victim being alerted to malicious
activity. For example, Black Shoggoth (a.k.a. Reaper) reconfigured a new ComSysApp
service for its own malicious purposes by first deleting the legitimate one.263 Virtually all
ransomware variants kill active processes that prevent them from accessing files targeted
for encryption. EKANS (a.k.a White Morok) ransomware takes this one step further by
closing OT processes for a range of ICS services.264

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 57

Education
In 2020, we saw a great deal of activity targeting
the education sector, particularly towards higher
education institutions.
Espionage activity has likely reflected long term
strategic priorities such as the collection of
research and data related to research of economic,
military or geopolitical interest, or the monitoring
overseas student communities for dissident
activity. This has included an ongoing focus by
threat actors such as Yellow Nabu (a.k.a. Silent
Librarian), an Iran-based threat actor which has
continued to conduct credential phishing
campaigns targeting universities across the world,
and operate sites for the sale and distribution of
documents stolen in its intrusions.265
We also observed threat actors targeting the sector
for the first time in activity likely reflecting wider
strategic objectives. This included Russia-based
threat actor Blue Callisto which targeted at least
two UK universities, as well as UK government
organisations. The threat actor used phishing

pages based on cloned Microsoft Office365 login
pages in order to obtain credentials, which we
assessed were likely later used to compromise the
targeted organisations.266
As discussed in the Crime section, ransomware
continued to be a major threat to all sectors.
Educational institutions remain a popular target as
they offer an essential service, making the potential
economic payoff for ransomware actors
substantial. For example, in June 2020, the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) fell
victim to ransomware that encrypted a limited
number of servers within the university’s School of
Medicine, making them temporarily inaccessible. It
is likely that NetWalker ransomware 267 was used in
this incident, which resulted in a payment of over
USD 1 million. Other cyber crime threats such as
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion
attacks have remained a threat, particularly given
the greater reliance on remote teaching.

Technology & telecommunications
Organisations in the technology and
telecommunications sector are high value targets,
not only for their intellectual property, but also as
part of supply chain attacks. This has come into
sharp focus yet again in late 2020 following the
SolarWinds compromise, which in turn led to the
potential compromise of many of its customers.268
We also observed TSCookie backdoor samples,
uniquely associated with Red Djinn (a.k.a.
BlackTech), signed with a value digital certificate
belonging to a Chinese high-tech and
supercomputers manufacturer. There is a realistic
probability these were stolen from the manufacturer
in an attempt to bypass application blocking.269
In the telecommunications sector, we observed an
espionage campaign targeting several
organisations across Vietnam, China and India
which we attribute to Scarlet Ioke.270 The threat

actor sideloaded a malicious DLL into memory
using a legitimate version of WinWord and
ultimately deployed Cobalt Strike payloads.
Throughout 2020, we observed Red Phoenix (a.k.a
APT27, Emissary Panda), target and compromise
several technology companies in several countries.
These included manufacturers of network devices,
and security software.
Red Charon (a.k.a. Chimera), a threat actor PwC
evicted from several semiconductor and advanced
materials organisations from 2014-2016, before an
apparent period of inactivity, resumed operations
aggressively in 2020. The threat actor continued to
demonstrate an interest in the high tech industry,
but also a specific focus on low cost airlines in
Europe, using several bespoke malware families,
and abusing a variety of cloud services for
command and control and data exfiltration.

Case study
Telecommunications company attacked through trusted relationship
PwC’s Incident Response team assisted a Hong
Kong-headquartered telecommunications company
which constantly suffered attacks from a business
partner network. The organisation discovered that
a threat actor gained access to a server inside a
data centre which serves a team of call centre
agents for the client. The data centre had operator
workstations and servers with direct connectivity
with the client’s server farm. The threat actor
leveraged the hacked server as a pivot point to
infiltrate into the client’s internal network through
legacy system vulnerabilities and credential
brute-forcing. After gaining initial access, the threat
actor brought in common tools for enumeration
(e.g. nbtscan), lateral movement, (e.g. PsExec) and
credentials dumping (e.g. Mimikatz and
secretsdump). After obtaining domain
administrative privileges, the attacker continued to
move laterally around the network before it was
detected and its access was removed.
While our client identified and restricted access
from the server that initiated the attack, the threat
actor continued to find ways back into the network.
It started to compromise other endpoints within the

data centre and used these as pivots to conduct
other forms of attack against the client, leveraging
the trusted relationship of the business partnership
to connect back to the network.
For network pivoting, the attacker used the
Windows built-in command line utility netsh to
create a port-proxy on the operator endpoints in
the data centre, which are trusted with direct
connectivity to the client network. Other than
credentials reuse, lateral movement and theft of
new credentials, the threat actor also utilised an
exploit of the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-20201472) to achieve domain compromise.
The threat actor was once again removed from the
network upon the detection of its activities, due to
the service outage brought by the side effect of the
exploit. The client subsequently performed a
complete review of the network connectivity
between the business partners as well as other
network demarcation points, and further
segmented the server network to isolate the legacy
zones and business partner network zone.

Aerospace and defence
The aerospace and defence sector has long been a
target for espionage given the sensitivity of the
information it holds, where links to military
applications will make many organisations in the
sector a valuable strategic target.
•

We observed North Korea-based threat actors
continuing to target the sector throughout 2020,
with Black Banshee targeting defence
companies in South Korea and Europe, and
Black Artemis as part of its ShowState
campaign.271

•

We observed a Russian-language lure
document containing information concerning
the 2020 Seattle Aerospace and Defence
Supplier Summit conference, which exploited

the Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-20180798) to deliver a Bisonal backdoor payload. We
attributed this activity to Red Beifang.272
•

Yellow Garuda was observed spoofing the
domains of two satellite imagery and analytics
companies based in the US and France
between September and October 2020. We
assess this activity was likely intended to phish
credentials and access mailboxes related to the
companies or their clients.273

•

In 2020, Yellow Liderc targeted large aerospace
and defence manufacturers as well as engine
manufacturers and airlines.274

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 59

Financial services
The financial services sector is a prime target for
financially motivated cyber crime given the
significant capital it holds. Cryptocurrency
exchanges continued to be a popular target given
the relative ease at which threat actors can transfer
and obscure their stolen currency. North Koreabased threat actors have conducted operations in
this space including the targeting of entities
involved in blockchain products and research in
2020.275 More general cyber crime activity such as
BEC remains a threat to organisations in the sector,
as highlighted by the 2020 Norfund fraud
incident.276

We also observed Red Djinn spoofing the domain
of a Taiwanese financial services company in a
likely attempt to target the sector for espionage
purposes. This activity was related to a sample of
the Bluether variant of the PLEAD malware family.277
In September 2020, we uncovered a series of
campaigns which delivered Cobalt Strike using a
unique dropper we call xStart. We assess this was
used to target organisations in China across a
number of sectors, including financial services, for
espionage-motivated activity. We currently track
this activity as White Dev 50.278, 279

Retail & consumer markets
Financially motivated cyber crime remains the
largest threat to the sector due to the volume of
monetary transactions that take place.
As seen in the Cyber crime section, ransomware
attacks have affected organisations in the retail and
consumer sector above all others, and with the
advent of leak sites, this has posed new risks
particularly pertaining to customer data.
The compromise of ecommerce platforms through
JavaScript-based malware – more commonly
known as Magecart – continued throughout 2020,
although this activity has been largely

overshadowed by higher profile ransomware
incidents. With a growing emphasis on online retail,
in part propelled by national lockdowns, this
activity is likely to continue as more organisations
look to rapidly increase their online presence.
BEC attacks also remained a significant threat. We
observed an extensive phishing campaign
beginning in June 2020 targeting a range of sectors
and geographies with financial themed lures.
Although the activity was likely opportunistic in
nature our analysis found the most targeted sectors
to be consumer markets and manufacturing.280

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 60

Energy
The increasing convergence between operational
technology (OT) and corporate IT environments
continues to widen the potential attack surface to
industrial environments and lower the barrier to entry
for a wider range of threat actors. In 2020, EKANS
ransomware was found to kill specific industrial
control system (ICS) processes before activating its
encryption routine.281
Intelligence gathering activity remains a threat, in
part due to the increasing competition in the sector,
where new technologies, particularly pertaining to
green technologies are likely to be highly sought
after. In July 2020, the United States Department of
Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against two
Chinese nationals, accused of conducting
intelligence gathering cyber attacks in alignment to

state objectives, as well as financially motivated
attacks for personal gain.282, 283 The activity included
the compromise of the network of an Australian solar
energy engineering firm and stealing information
related to high-efficiency gas turbines from a
mechanical engineering company.
There have also been a number of high profile
ransomware incidents affecting the sector in 2020,
likely driven in part by the perceived wealth of
organisations within the sector. Attacks involving
Ragnar Locker,284 Sodinokibi285 and Maze286
ransomware families have all resulted in the theft and
leak of data, a tactic that has become increasingly
prominent in ransomware attacks in general.

Transport
Intelligence gathering activity has been at the
forefront of targeting, particularly in aviation. During
2020, several low cost airlines in Europe were
targeted by both Red Charon 287 and Yellow Liderc.288
In October 2020, an attack on San Francisco
International Airport was attributed to Russiabased threat actor Blue Kraken.289 Our analysis of IP
addresses likely under the control of the threat
actor indicated traffic associated with the wider
aviation supply chain and related third parties in
addition to airports and airlines. This included
technology companies developing software for use
in aviation and organisations involved in lobbying
and developing industry data and insights.290

Although ransomware remains a threat to all
organisations, 2020 saw several victims in the
transport and logistics sectors.291 These
organisations were likely targeted as the high
business impact to their operations may make them
more likely to meet ransom demands. In August
2020, international transport and logistics company
TFI disclosed that four Canadian courier divisions
were impacted by a ransomware outbreak.292 French
container transportation and shipping company,
CMA CGM was targeted by Ragnar Locker
ransomware in September 2020. The company shut
down its online services as part of its containment
strategy.293

Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect | 61

Conclusion
2020 was an unpredictable year with the COVID-19
pandemic bringing an unprecedented change to the
business world and, as a result, to the cyber threat
landscape. The dependency on remote working
infrastructure has brought existing threats into
prominence, such as the exploitation of vulnerabilities
in VPNs, enterprise remote access and virtualisation
software.
Threat actors have always made use of timely lures
reflecting real-world events in their phishing
campaigns, and the pandemic has been no
exception, with a plethora of related themes used by
cyber crime and espionage threat actors alike.
However, the majority of this activity was focussed on
business as usual operations. For espionage threat
actors, we saw continued alignment to the strategic
objectives of nation states with tit-for-tat activity
reflecting wider shifts in the geopolitical landscape.
The supply chain remained a prominent attack vector
with several high profile compromises in 2020.

In a continuation from 2019, there were several
instances of espionage threat actors being linked to
financially motivated activity. These dual motivations
are likely due to activity being performed for personal
gain as opposed to a wider shift in operational
objectives. However the variation in activity, in terms
of a deviation in expected targeting and tooling,
provides extra challenges in both defence and
attribution efforts. 2020 also saw a number of
hacker-for-hire operations publicly exposed, changing
our traditional understanding of espionage activity.
The cyber crime scene has been dominated by
ransomware and the advent of leak sites. Victims
must now deal with the potential of sensitive data
leaks and public exposure of the incidents, in addition
to the business impact caused by the encryption. The
success of these operations saw a surge in new
players and existing cyber crime groups expanding
into the field. This resulted in a definitive shift in the
cyber threat landscape making ransomware
operations a significant threat for organisations
across all sectors and geographies, in a trend that is
likely to continue throughout 2021.
