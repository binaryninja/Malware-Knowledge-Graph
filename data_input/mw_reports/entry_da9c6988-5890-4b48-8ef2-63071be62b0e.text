The Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Report describes ransomware incident response
trends during Q1 of 2021. Data exfiltration extortion continues to be prevalent and we have
reached an inflection point where the vast majority of ransomware attacks now include the
theft of corporate data. Q1 saw a reversal of average and median ransom amounts. The
averages in Q1 were pulled up by a raft of data exfiltration attacks by one specific threat
actor group that opportunistically leveraged a unique vulnerability (more on this below).

Average and Median Ransom Payments
The average ransom payment increased 43% to $220,298 from $154,108 in Q4 of 2020.
The median payment in Q1 also increased to $78,398 from $49,450, a 58% increase.
Averages and median were pulled higher by a small number of threat actor groups, most
specifically CloP, that were extremely active during Q1 and impacted large victims with very
high ransom demands. As the data exfiltration tactic has proliferated, the risk / reward
characteristics of paying to suppress a leak has not changed. We first noted this trend in our
Q3 report; victims of data exfiltration extortion have very little to gain by paying a cyber
criminal, and despite the increase in demands, and higher prevalence of data theft, we are
encouraged that a growing number of victims are not paying. Over hundreds of cases, we
have yet to encounter an example where paying a cyber criminal to suppress stolen data
helped the victim mitigate liability or avoid business / brand damage. On the contrary, paying
creates a false sense of security, unintended consequences and future liabilities. Coveware’s
position remains unchanged and we advise victims of data exfiltration extortion to assume
the following:
The data will not be credibly destroyed. Victims should assume it will be traded to other
threat actors, sold, misplaced, or held for a second/future extortion attempt.
Exfiltrated data custody was held by multiple parties and not secured. Even if the threat
actor deletes a volume of data following a payment, other parties that had access to it
may have made copies so that they can extort the victim in the future.

The data may be deliberately or mistakenly published before a victim can even respond
to an extortion attempt.
Complete records of what was taken may not be delivered by the threat actor, even if
they explicitly promise to provide such artifacts after payment.

77% of Ransomware Attacks Involved the Threat to Leak Exfiltrated
Data (+10% From Q4 2020)
The percentage of ransomware attacks that included a threat to release stolen data
increased from 70% in Q4, to 77% in Q1. The majority of ransomware attacks that involve
data exfiltration have two main goals 1) exfiltrate corporate data from the most convenient
file server 2) escalate privileges and deploy ransomware on as many endpoints as possible.
Most RaaS affiliates purchase network access and use stolen data solely as additional
leverage against the victim. This means that despite the threats, threat actors rarely take the
time to steal data that any other criminals or interested parties would want to purchase. The
stolen data is just proof that the attack occurred and sometimes creates legal obligations for
the victim.
The CloP ransomware group took a very different strategy in their Q1 exploitation of
Accellion’s FTA product. Beginning in late December and continuing through much of Q1,
CloP exploited two zero day vulnerabilities that allowed for remote code execution within
unpatched Accellion FTA instances. This was a highly sophisticated and targeted exploitation
of a single software appliance, only used by a handful of enterprises. The CloP group may
have purchased the exploit used in the initial stages of the attack, so as to have exclusive
use. This behavior stands in stark contrast to how most unauthorized network access is
brokered through the cyber extortion supply chain to any willing purchaser post exploitation.
Moreover, the Accellion exploit did not allow for the deployment of ransomware across the
victims environment, so data theft from the appliance was the sole target of CloPs campaign
from the outset.
Unlike most exploits used by ransomware threat actors, unpatched Accellion FTA instances
are rare (likely less than 100 total), especially when compared to vulnerable RDP instances
which number hundreds of thousands globally. CloP’s confidence that such a small number
of targets would yield a positive financial return must have been high and, unfortunately, they
were correct. Dozens of CloP victims were extorted for tens of millions of dollars even though
the majority of the victims opted not to pay and were subsequently doxxed on the CloP leak
site. As of early April, the CloP/Accellion campaign seems to have run its course, and the
CloP group has returned to using traditional network access vectors and encryption
ransomware in its attacks.

Top 10: Market Share of the Ransomware attacks
Ransomware-as-a-Service operations ratcheted up the competition for affiliates and
credibility in Q1. As these groups have grown in size, so has associated operational
complexity and risk. Some failures of operating a criminal enterprise at scale were observed
during Q1 include:
Egregor: Sunsetting operations only 4 months after taking the torch from the Maze
group.
Netwalker: Ceased activities following a complete law enforcement take down of
infrastructure and arrest of affiliate participants.
Conti: Growing pains as their outsourced chat operations complicated victim recoveries
and negotiations. Additionally, Conti has also been re-attacking prior victims and
launching new attacks shortly after an initial attack was sustained. A practice at odds
with a RaaS organization interested in maintaining a reputation that compels victims to
pay a ransom.
Lockbit: Technical flaws in the ransomware that resulted in data loss of encryption
victims. The group has also been associated with numerous re-extortion demands.
Sodinokibi: Technical flaws that resulted in victims unable to match encryption keys,
resulting in total data loss.

4/11

BlackKingdom: Attempted a mass exploit of exchange webshells, but flaws in their
encryption led to permanent data loss.
A new trend in Q1, several RaaS operations turned their focus to developing encryption
modules for Unix and Linux. We have now observed this development from Defray777,
Mespinoza, Babuk, Nephilim and Darkside. Sodinokibi is also making rumblings about
releasing a Unix version. Victims running Unix and Linux should expect complications and
data loss. Early versions of any ransomware generally include bugs that the threat actors
either don’t know about or don’t care to fix before targeting victims.

Most Common Ransomware Attack Vectors in Q1 2021

Ransomware attack vectors: RDP compromise, email phishing, software vulnerability, and
others.
In Q1 compromised remote desktop protocol connections regained the top position as the
most common attack vector. RDP remains a frustratingly common vulnerability despite well
known secure remote connection best practices. Phishing emails that install credential
stealing malware, or a remote access trojan also remain a common attack vector. Like RDP,
defense techniques that include least privilege and two factor authentication can easily limit
the ability of an attacker to escalate privileges beyond the initially compromised machine.

5/11

Defending against the escalatory impact of a successful phishing attack requires no new
hardware or software, just the will to implement and follow simple tools and configurations
properly.

Attack Vectors used by the Top Three Ransomware Variants

Top 3 Ransomware Types: Sodinokibi, Conti V2, and Lockbit.
The most common software vulnerabilities exploited during Q1 involved VPN appliances,
such at Fortinet and Pulse Secure. Several RaaS services leveraged these VPN
vulnerabilities during Q1. Again, it is likely that the actual RaaS operators and affiliates were
NOT the party that achieved network access via these vulnerabilities, but rather specialist
actors that harvest network credentials and are specifically trained to mass scan for
vulnerable IP addresses. These specialists then resell network access to ransomware
affiliates who use the access to stage the extortion phase of the attack. This deliberate
division of labor sheds light on how open RaaS operations that focus on smaller victims, like
Lockbit, were able to take advantage of vulnerabilities outside of their skillset. Specialization
and supply chain coordination also highlights the continued evolution of the cyber extortion
economy.

Attack Vectors used by Ransomware Actors on Different Sized
Victims

Attack Vector by Company Size Q1 2021
During Q1, the cyber extortion economic supply chain demonstrated how a vulnerability in
widely used VPN appliances can be identified, exploited and monetized by ransomware
affiliates. It is rare to see software vulnerabilities directly leveraged by affiliates of RaaS
groups, but when specialists broadly market the results of their elicit skills then the costs of
carrying out an attack decline and lower the barriers to entry for new cyber criminals.
The continued evolution and specialization of the ransomware supply chain is a worrisome
trend. Lower overall operating costs drop the barrier to entry AND boost the profitability of
attacks. Until the unit economics of ransomware attacks becomes less profitable, we should
expect the volume of attacks to continue to increase. Even more worrisome is the maturity
and progression of the supply chain within the cyber extortion economy. The infrastructure
that is being created to run this economy will be difficult to unwind. The more mature the
supply chain is allowed to become, the harder it will be to dismantle.

Most Industries Impacted by Ransomware in Q1 2021

7/11

Common Industries Targeted by Ransomware in Q1 2021
The most notable change in industries impacted by ransomware attacks in Q1 was the
Professional Services industry, specifically law firms. Small and medium sized law firms
continue to succumb to encryption ransomware and data exfiltration extortion attacks.
Unfortunately, the economics of many small professional service firms do not encourage or
enable adequate cyber security.
For example, many law firms are structured as limited partnerships for tax purposes. This
means the firm pays out all its profit to the partners every year. The desire to maximize
profits and income to the partners can marginalize the priority of investing in cybersecurity.
Another example is the third party vendor relationships of a small law firm. These firms
generally do not work with major enterprises that would perform rigorous cyber risk
assessments, the most basic of which would immediately surface common vulnerabilities
and weaknesses that may result in a future ransomware attack. Rather, small firms tend to
have equally sized clients that do not demand vendor assessments of cyber risk.
As a result of these two examples there is minimal internal or external market pressure to
prioritize cyber security. The volume of professional service firms that are victimized is a
result of these micro dynamics.

Median Size of Ransomware Attack Victims in Q1 2021

8/11

Median Size of Companies Targeted by Ransomware
Ransomware attacks still disproportionately affect small businesses. These small companies
rarely end up in the headlines and often don’t have the financial or technical expertise to
properly handle the incident OR perform the proper remediation required to prevent a repeat
attack. Small businesses that exist below the cyber security poverty line represent the
greatest challenge to stemming the expansion of the cyber extortion economy.

Distribution by company size (employee count)

Incident Duration and Business Interruption of a Ransomware
Attack
Average Days of Downtime
23
+10% from Q4 2020
Incident duration expanded slightly in Q1 to an average of 23 days. Contributing factors to
this increase were the average length of time it takes to adjudicate data exfiltration incidents,
and technical challenges from corrupted data (see above discussion on flaws in certain
ransomware causing data loss). Q1 also included multiple instances of deliberate disruption
by the threat actor during the recovery period following the initial attack. Disruptions included
attempts to steal additional data or re-launch the ransomware. Prior to Q1 such behavior was
a rare occurrence, but the tactic appears to be gaining traction amongst certain threat
groups. This behavior not only exacerbates business interruption, but delays negotiation
progress. This behavior also undermines the victim’s confidence that the threat actor will
assist in a successful resolution. The threat actor’s expectation that re-attacking increases
the pressure to pay is misguided. Re-attacks make victims less inclined to facilitate any sort
of payment.
