There were not many known large ransomware attacks this week, but we have seen
ransomware operations evolving their tactics to extort their victims further.

1/6

The largest attack this week was against Tawainese laptop maker Compal, who was hit by
DoppelPaymer. The threat actors are demanding $17 million to receive a decryptor and not
to leak stolen files.
Ransomware operations have also begun new tactics this week to pressure their victims
into paying a ransom.
After their attack on Campari, Ragnar Locker hacked a Facebook advertiser's account
to run Facebook ads promoting their attack and threatening to release more data. Their
strategy is to apply as much pressure as they can on the victim through public awareness in
the hopes it will force them to pay the ransom.
Another new tactic announced by DarkSide is their plans to create a fault-tolerant
distributed storage service based out of Iran or other "unrecognized republics." Their goal is
to use this storage as a platform to leak victim's data for six months, and due to its
distributed nature, if one server is shut down by law enforcement, the other servers will still
be able to leak the data.
Otherwise, this week has been mostly new variants of existing ransomware families.

were created, and are currently maintained by, the same financially motivated threat group.
