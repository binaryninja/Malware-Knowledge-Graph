This post was authored by David Liebenberg.

Summary
Cryptocurrency miners are becoming an increasingly significant part of the threat landscape.
These malicious miners steal CPU cycles from compromised devices to mine
cryptocurrencies and bring in income for the threat actor.
In this post, we look at the activity of one particular threat actor: Rocke. We will examine
several of Rocke's campaigns, malware, and infrastructure while uncovering more
information about the actor. After months of research, we believe that Rocke is an actor that
must be followed, as they continue to add new features to their malware and are actively
exploring new attack vectors.

Introduction
Talos has written widely about the issue of cryptomining malware and how organizations
should protect systems against this threat. We continue to actively research developments in
1/12

this threat through research that includes monitoring criminal forums and deploying honeypot
systems to attract these threats. It is through these intelligence sources that the Chinesespeaking actor which we refer to as "Rocke" came to our attention.
Rocke actively engages in distributing and executing cyrptomining malware using a varied
toolkit that includes Git repositories, HttpFileServers (HFS), and a myriad of different
payloads, including shell scripts, JavaScript backdoors, as well as ELF and PE miners.

Early campaigns
This threat actor initially came to our attention in April 2018, leveraging both Western and
Chinese Git repositories to deliver malware to honeypot systems vulnerable to an Apache
Struts vulnerability.
Several files were downloaded to our Struts2 honeypot from the Chinese repository site
gitee.com for a user named "c-999." Subsequently, the Gitee user page transitioned to "c888." Around the same time, we observed similar activity pulling down files from a gitlab.com
repository page for a user named "c-18."
The repositories on both Gitee and GitLab were identical. All the repositories had a folder
called "ss" that contained 16 files. The files were a collection of ELF executables, shell
scripts, and text files that execute a variety of actions, including achieving persistence and
the execution of an illicit cryptocurrency miner.
Once the threat actor had compromised a system, they achieved persistence on the device
by installing a cron job that downloads and executes a file "logo.jpg" from "3389[.]space."
This file is a shell script which, in turn, downloads mining executables from the threat actor's
Git repositories and saves them under the filename "java." The exact file downloaded
depends on the victim's system architecture. Similarly, the system architecture determines if
"h32" or "h64" is used to invoke "java."
Although we first observed this actor exploiting vulnerabilities in Apache Struts, we've also
observed what we believe to the same individual exploiting an Oracle WebLogic server
vulnerability (CVE-2017-10271), and also exploiting CVE-2017-3066, a critical Java
deserialization vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion platform.

Recent campaign
In late July, we became aware that the same actor was engaged in another similar
campaign. Through our investigation into this new campaign, we were able to uncover more
details about the actor.

2/12

We observed a wget request from our Struts2 honeypot for a file named "0720.bin" located
on 118[.]24[.]150[.]172:10555. We visited this IP and found it was an open HFS hosting
"0720.bin" along with 10 additional files: "3307.bin," "a7," "bashf," "bashg," "config.json,"
"lowerv2.sh," "pools.txt," "r88.sh," "rootv2.sh" and "TermsHost.exe." We set about examining
these files.

Screenshot of HFS system
We had previously observed this same IP scanning for TCP port 7001 throughout May 2018.
This was potentially a scan for Oracle WebLogic servers, which listens on TCP port 7001 by
default.
Both "0720.bin" and "3307.bin" are similar ELF files of similar size (84.19KB) that reach out
to 118[.]24[.]150[.]172, and were marked clean in VirusTotal at the time of discovery.
Morpheus Labs described a similar file that connects to the same IP address, which could
open a shell on the victim's machine if a password-verified instruction was issued from the
C2. In both our samples, as well as the ones that Morpheus Labs described, the hard-coded
password was not only identical, but also located at the same offset.

3/12

Hard-coded password
"A7" is a shell script that kills a variety of processes related to other cryptomining malware
(including those with names matching popular mining malware such as "cranberry," "yam," or
"kworker"), as well as mining in general (such as "minerd" and "cryptonight"). It detects and
uninstalls various Chinese AV, and also downloads and extracts a tar.gz file from
blog[.]sydwzl[.]cn, which also resolves to 118[.]24[.]150[.]172. The script downloads a file
from GitHub called "libprocesshider," which hides a file called "x7" using the ID preloader.
The script looks for IP addresses in known_hosts and attempts to SSH into them, before
downloading "a7" again from the actor's HFS at 118[.]24[.]150[.]172, and execute it.

4/12

Extract of Source Code of "a7"
"Config.json" is a mining config file for XMRig, an open-source Monero miner. The file sets
the mining pool as xmr[.]pool[.]MinerGate[.]com:45700 and the actor's wallet as
rocke@live.cn. This is why we have named the actor "Rocke" (note that for MinerGate, an
email can be used in place of a Monero wallet number â€” it's simply the login email for the
MinerGate platform). "Pools.txt" appears to be a config file for XMR-stak, an open-source
universal Stratum pool miner that mines Monero, Aeon and more. This configuration file
contains the same actor pool and wallet information as the first.
"Bashf" is a variant of XMR-stak while "bashg" is a variant of XMRig.
"Lowerv2.sh" and "rootv2.sh" are similar shell scripts that attempt to download and execute
the mining malware components "bashf" and "bashg," hosted on 118[.]24[.]150[.]172. If the
shell scripts do not download a miner from 118[.]24[.]150[.]172, they attempt to download a
file called "XbashY" from 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk.
"R88.sh" is a shell script that installs a cron job and attempts to download "lowerv2.sh" or
"rootv2.sh."
"TermsHost.exe" is a PE32 Monero miner. Based on the config file it uses, it appears to be
the Monero Silent Miner. This miner can be purchased online for $14 and targets malicious
actors. Advertising for the miner promotes it as offering startup registry key persistence,
mining only while idle, and the ability to inject the miner into "Windows processes to bypass
5/12

firewalls." The sample grabs the config file "xmr.txt," which contains the same configuration
information as the previous files, from Rocke's command and control (C2) server hosted on
sydwzl[.]cn. The sample then injects code into notepad.exe, which then proceeds to
communicate with the MinerGate pool. The sample also creates the UPX-packed file
"dDNLQrsBUE.url" in the Windows Start Menu Folder. Intriguingly, this file appears to share
some similarities with Cobalt Strike, the popular penetration testing software, which would
allow the attacker to have greater control over the infected system.
The payload appears to be similar to one used by the Iron Cybercrime Group, as reported by
cybersecurity firm Intezer in May. Both Iron and Rocke's malware behave similarly, and reach
out to similar infrastructure. So, while we can asses with high confidence that the payloads
share some code base, we are still unsure of the exact relationship between Rocke and Iron
Cybercrime Group.

The actor
Through Rocke's MinerGate Monero wallet email rocke@live.cn, we were able to uncover
additional information about the actor. We noticed that Rocke's C2 was registered to the
address jxci@vip.qq.com. We then found a leak of user information from the Chinese
security site FreeBuf that showed that a user named "rocke" was associated with the email
jxci@vip.qq.com. This suggested that they were one in the same. [4]
Rocke has been observed seeking access to cloud storage services, as well as obtaining
manuals for programming in the Chinese Easy language.
The majority of websites registered to Rocke list Jiangxi Province addresses for their
registration. Some of these websites were for Jiangxi-based businesses, such as
belesu[.]com, which sells baby food. We had had additional indications that Rocke is from
Jiangxi based on their GitHub (see below). It is possible that the "jx" in jxci@vip.qq.com
stands for Jiangxi. Therefore, we assess with high confidence that Rocke operates from
Jiangxi Province.

The GitHub
We identified a GitHub page apparently associated with Rocke. The GitHub page lists Rocke
as being affiliated with Jiangxi Normal University. In one repository folder, we found several
of the same files which were found on the HFS system, including several of the shell scripts
with their wallet information included, as well as variants of the miner.

6/12

We found additional repositories for the same account. Within these repositories, we found
scripts similar to those found in previous campaigns, with the exception that they reached out
to sydwzl[.]cn in addition to the previously observed domain 3389[.]space. These findings
support the link between Rocke and the activity we previously observed in April and May.
We also found an additional repository through Rocke's page that's hosting nearly identical
content, but with a different C2. However, we are unable to determine how that page is being
used or who is using it.
The files within their various repositories show that Rocke has become interested in browserbased JavaScript mining through the tool CryptoNote, as well as browser-based exploitation
through the Browser Exploitation Framework. It appears that they are relying on fake Google
Chrome alerts, fake apps, and fake Adobe Flash updates to social engineer users into
downloading malicious payloads.

7/12

One of the JavaScript files in the repository, named "command.js," uses hidden IFrames to
deliver payloads hosted on CloudFront domains. The payload that we were able to obtain
was UPX packed and behaved very similarly to the file "dDNLQrsBUE.url" dropped by
"TermsHost.exe."
Rocke has also shown interest in other security-related repositories. They have forked
repositories with exploit information, including those related to Apache Struts 2, JBoss and
Shadow Brokers, as well as more general-use tools such as masscan, proxy tools and brute
forcers.
8/12

Conclusion
Based on their activity in the past few months, Talos assesses with high confidence that
Rocke will continue to leverage Git repositories to download and execute illicit mining onto
victim machines. It is interesting to note that they are expanding their toolset to include
browser-based miners, difficult-to-detect trojans, and the Cobalt Strike malware. Besides
noisy scan-and-exploit activity, it appears that Rocke is likely also pursuing social
engineering as a new infection vector, as demonstrated by the repositories involving fake
Adobe Flash and Google Chrome updates.
Despite the volatility in the value of various cryptocurrencies, the trend of illicit cryptocurrency
mining activity among cybercriminals shows no signs of abating. Rocke's various campaigns
show the variety of infection vectors, malware, and infrastructure that these criminals will
employ to achieve their goals.
