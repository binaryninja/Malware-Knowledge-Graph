Today, the EU and its member states, together with partners, expose malicious cyber
activities that significantly affected our economy, security, democracy and society at large.
The EU and its member states assess these malicious cyber activities to have been
undertaken from the territory of China.
The compromise and exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange server undermined the security
and integrity of thousands of computers and networks worldwide, including in the member
states and EU institutions. It allowed access to a significant number of hackers that have
continued to exploit the compromise to date. This irresponsible and harmful behaviour
resulted in security risks and significant economic loss for our government institutions and
private companies, and has shown significant spill-over and systemic effects for our security,
economy and society at large.
We have also detected malicious cyber activities with significant effects that targeted
government institutions and political organisations in the EU and member states, as well as
key European industries. These activities can be linked to the hacker groups known as
Advanced Persistent Threat 40 and Advanced Persistent Threat 31 and have been
conducted from the territory of China for the purpose of intellectual property theft and
espionage.

The EU and its member states strongly denounce these malicious cyber activities, which are
undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all
UN member states. We continue to urge the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms
and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and take all appropriate
measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the
situation.
The EU and its member states reaffirm their strong commitment to responsible state
behaviour to ensure a global, open, free, stable and secure cyberspace. To this end, we will
continue to work on the establishment of a Programme of Action under UN auspices to
advance and effectively support states to adhere to responsible state behaviour in
cyberspace.
We reiterate our determination to continue to counter malicious behaviour in cyberspace. We
will continue to enhance our cooperation, including with international partners and other
public and private stakeholders, through increased exchange of information and continued
diplomatic engagement, by strengthening cyber resilience and incident handling cooperation,
as well as through joint efforts to improve the overall security of software and their supply
chains.
The Candidate Countries the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania[1] and
the EFTA country Norway, member of the European Economic Area, align themselves with
this declaration.
[1] The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the

Stabilisation and Association Process.
