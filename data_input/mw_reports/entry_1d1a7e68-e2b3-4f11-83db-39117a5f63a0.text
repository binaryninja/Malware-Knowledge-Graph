A ransomware family named FireCrypt will encrypt the user's files, but also attempt to
launch a very feeble DDoS attack on a URL hardcoded in its source code.
This threat was discovered today by MalwareHunterTeam. Below is an analysis of the
ransomware's mode of operation, provided by MalwareHunterTeam and Bleeping
Computer's Lawrence Abrams.

FireCrypt comes as a ransomware building kit
Malware is usually generated by compiling it from source code, or by using automated
software that takes certain input parameters and outputs a customized malware payload on
a per-campaign basis.
The latter are known in the industry as malware builders and usually come as commandline applications or GUI-based tools.
The author of the FireCrypt ransomware uses a command-line application that automates
the process of putting FireCrypt samples together, allowing him to modify basic settings
without having to tinker with bulky IDEs that compile its source code.
FireCrypt's builder is named BleedGreen (seen below), and allows the FireCrypt author to
generate a unique ransomware executable, give it a custom name, and use a personalized
file icon. Compared to other ransomware builders, this is a very low-end application. Similar
builders usually allow crooks to customize a wider set of options, such as the Bitcoin
address where to receive payments, the ransom demand value, contact email address, and
more.

The builder's role, besides disguising an EXE file under a PDF or DOC icon, is also to
slightly alter the ransomware's binary, in order to generate a file with a different hash at
every new compilation.
The technique is often used by malware developers to create so-called "polymorphic
malware" that's harder to detect by standard antivirus software. According to
MalwareHunterTeam, "the builder is very basic, so this shouldn't help anything against real
AVs."
Nevertheless, this also tells us that FireCrypt author has at least some sort of experience in
developing malware, and isn't your regular script kiddie that downloaded open-source
ransomware from GitHub.

FireCrypt infection process
The FireCrypt infection process hinges on the ransomware's distributor's ability to trick
users in launching the EXE file they just generated.
Once this happens, FireCrypt will kill the computer's Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) and begin
to encrypt a list of 20 file types. FireCrypt encrypts files with the AES-256 encryption
algorithm.
All encrypted files will have their original file name and extension appended with ".firecrypt".
For example, a file named photo.png will be renamed into photo.png.firecrypt.

Once the file encryption process ends, FireCrypt drops its ransom note on the user's
Desktop.

FireCrypt ransom note
The ransom note is a nearly identical copy of the ransom note used by the Deadly for a
Good Purpose Ransomware, discovered on October 14 by the same MalwareHunterTeam.

Deadly for a Good Purpose Ransomware ransom note
At the time it was discovered in October 2016, the Deadly for a Good Purpose Ransomware
appeared to be under development, as its source code would begin the file encryption
process only if the victim's computer date were for a day in 2017 and later.
Compared to FireCrypt, the only difference is that the Deadly for a Good Purpose
Ransomware also featured a logo at the top of the ransom note, now missing in FireCrypt.
But, at a close inspection of Deadly's source code, MalwareHunterTeam was able to
discover that both ransomware versions used the same email and Bitcoin addresses,
showing a clear connection between the two, with FireCrypt being a rebranded version of
the original Deadly for a Good Purpose Ransomware.

The DDoS function that fills your hard drive with junk files
After dropping the ransom note, FireCrypt doesn't stop its malicious behavior. Its source
code contains a function that continuously connects to a URL, downloads its content and
saves it to disk in a file in the %Temp% folder, named [random_chars][connect_number].html.
If users aren't aware of this function, FireCrypt will quickly fill the %Temp% folder up with
junk files.
6/9

Current versions of the FireCrypt ransomware will download the content of
http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php, which is the official portal of Pakistan's Telecommunication
Authority. This URL cannot be modified using the ransomware's builder.

FireCrypt DDoS function
The FireCrypt author calls this feature as a "DDoSer," but this would be a stretch. The crook
would have to infect thousands of victims before launching a DDoS attack large enough to
cause any problems to the Authority's website.
Furthermore, all victims should be infected at the same time, and have their computers
connected to the Internet in order to participate in the DDoS attack.
At the time of writing, there's no known method of recovering files encrypted with FireCrypt.
Victims infected with this threat that are unable or unwilling to pay the $500 ransom demand
should keep a copy of their encrypted files around, as a decrypter might be possibly
released in the future.

Targeted file extensions:
.txt, .jpg, .png, .doc, .docx, .csv, .sql, .mdb, .sln, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html,
.htm, .csx, .psd, .aep, .mp3, .pdf, .torrent

%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\[random_chars].exe - Startup
Executable
%Desktop%\[random_chars]-READ_ME.html - Ransom Note
%AppData%\SysWin32\files.txt - List of Encrypted Files
%Desktop%\random_chars]-filesencrypted.html - List of Encrypted Files

The genius behind this generates a new cryptographically strong 32-character string
per file, and never saves the keys anywhere. Even paying the ransom won't allow for
decryption.

How suprising.
