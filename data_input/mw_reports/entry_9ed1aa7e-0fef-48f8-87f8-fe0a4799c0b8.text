Threat Intelligence Report: Lazarus Group Campaign
Targeting the Cryptocurrency Vertical
labs.f-secure.com/publications/ti-report-lazarus-group-cryptocurrency-vertical/

In 2019, F-Secure uncovered technical details on Lazarus Group’s modus operandi during
an investigation of an attack on an organisation in the cryptocurrency vertical. Consistent
with public reporting on the group’s activities, the main objective of the attack was financial
gain.
F-Secure assess the attack on the target to be advanced in nature and was able to link this
activity with a global phishing campaign running since at least January 2018. The attack was
linked to this wider set of activity through several common indicators found in samples from
the investigation, open source repositories, and proprietary intelligence sources.
Lazarus Group’s activities are a continued threat: the phishing campaign associated with this
attack has been observed continuing into 2020, raising the need for awareness and ongoing
vigilance amongst organisations operating in the targeted verticals. It is F-Secure’s
assessment that the group will continue to target organisations within the cryptocurrency
vertical while it remains such a profitable pursuit, but may also expand to target supply chain
elements of the vertical to increase returns and longevity of the campaign.
Where possible, evidence has been included in the body and appendices of this report to
allow the security industry to leverage these details across their apertures, and draw their
own conclusions. F-Secure believes the detail in this report will help targeted
organizations protect their networks from future attacks and raise the cost of
operation for the group.
