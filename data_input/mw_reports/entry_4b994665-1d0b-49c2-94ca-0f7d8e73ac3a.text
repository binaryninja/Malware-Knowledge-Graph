Modification of the hard drive areas responsible for the initial loading of the system has
become increasing popular with cybercriminals. Moreover, cybercriminals have now moved
on from just modifying the MBR (master boot record) to infecting the code of the NTFS
loader.
We recently discovered an interesting piece of malware — Cidox. It is peculiar in that it
infects the load area code of the boot partition on the hard drive.
The master file Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Cidox “carries on board” two driver rootkits
(Rootkit.Win32/Win64.Cidox). One is compiled for 32-bit platforms, the other for 64-bit
platforms.
The source component of Cidox makes the following modifications to the beginning of the
hard drive:
Saves the relevant driver to free sectors at the beginning of the hard drive;
It chooses the section marked as the boot partition in the MBR partition table for
infection. It is important to note that it only infects partitions with the NTFS file system.

Writes part of its code over Extended NTFS IPL (Initial Program Loader), which is
responsible for parsing the MFT table (Master File Table), searching for the file with the
loader in the root directory of the section (ntldr — pre-Vista, bootmgr — Vista+),
reading this file form the disk and transferring control to it. At the same time the original
contents of Extended NTFS IPL are encrypted, saved and added to the end of the
malicious code.

The next time the system is booted the malicious code in the load area will be invoked. With
the help of a known technique, use of the Int 13h interrupt and some Windows kernel
features it successfully loads the malicious driver to the system. The loaded driver uses
PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine to control the launch of the following processes:
svchost.exe
iexplore.exe
firefox.exe
opera.exe
chrome.exe

If the launch of one of the processes above is detected, one more Cidox component is
integrated into it — a dynamic library (Trojan.Win32.Cidox). This library modifies any browser
output, substituting it with its own. As a result, the user sees a browser window displaying an
offer to renew the browser due to some malicious programs allegedly detected on the
system. The example below tells the user to renew the browser due to infection by
Trojan.Win32.Ddox.ci.

Of course, the user is asked to pay for the ‘renewal’. In order to obtain it, an SMS has to be
sent to a short number.
A unique page design is used for each of the most popular browsers.

It should be noted that new versions of browsers can in fact be downloaded free of charge
from the vendor’s website. Cybercriminals are merely scaring users in order to extort money
from them.

This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware

8/10

We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
