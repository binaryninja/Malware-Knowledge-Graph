general information
The Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine CERT-UA received
information on the distribution of e-mails on the topic "Wage arrears" among government
agencies of Ukraine. Attached to the letter is the document "Wage arrears.xls", which
contains legitimate statistics and macros. At the same time, hex-coded data has been added
to the mentioned document as an attachment. The macro, after activation, will decode the
data, create the EXE-file "Base-Update.exe" on the computer and execute it.
This file is a downloader developed using the GoLang programming language. The program
will download and run another bootloader, which, in turn, will download and run malware
GraphSteel and GrimPlant on your computer.
The detected activity is associated with the activity of the group UAC-0056.
