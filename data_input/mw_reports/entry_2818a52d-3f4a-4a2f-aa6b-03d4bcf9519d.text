Cloud Credential Compromise Campaign Originating from Russian-Affiliated Infrastructure

March 03, 2022 Proofpoint Cloud Security Research
Proofpoint Cloud Security group researchers have found widespread cloud credential
variance attacks on organizations since February 22, 2022, originating from Russianaffiliated infrastructure. This blog post will explain the very active threat campaign targeting
our customers’ cloud apps and how to secure your cloud risks.

Attack profile and example attack
As of February 28, 2022, we’ve observed approximately 78,000 credential variance attacks
(i.e. brute force or password spray attempts), targeting 4,340 user accounts across 728
monitored cloud environments. Over 85% of the targeted organizations are US-based, with
the remainder operating in other Western countries. The vast majority of attacks either
originated from identified Russian sources (IP addresses and DCH services located in
Russia) or from servers associated with Russian hosting services, chiefly in the US. In our
assessment, unauthorized access could open the door to account takeover, privilege
escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
The screenshot below showcases one of the many attacks we’ve seen. We detected this
threat to the user based on identifying the credential variance attack type, user behavior
analytics ,and the user being heavily targeted in the past (the user is a Very Attacked Person
, or VAP). In this case, the user has never attempted to log in to their organization’s Office
365 account using the hostname “mastercommunications.ru” and a data hosting center
(DCH) proxy. In fact, our threat intelligence has identified that as typical for this threat actor.

Targeted industries and other technical analysis
The primary targets have been varied, with no industry accounting for more than 11% of all
attacks. The top five most targeted industries account for 44% of all the attacks, including
manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, business services, and construction.

A few interesting artifacts of the campaign:
1. An unusual user agent (UA) string – “14 Windows Mobile - Tablet Very common” –
amongst the many we’ve seen. We have seen either as a standalone string or
appended to the end of a longer UA string. This UA string is unique to this campaign
and may be unintentional.
2. The attacks are conducted against users in alphabetic order by username, which may
be a trait of the credential variance tool kit used.
3. The malicious targeting attempts are decentralized, with multiple hosting services and
operational assets trying to compromise user accounts simultaneously.

Protect your cloud accounts with cloud security best practices
- Treat any traffic from the IOCs listed below as potentially suspicious while this campaign is
active.
- Monitor all cloud accounts of your organization for suspicious logins and remediate highly
suspicious logins immediately.

5/8

Limit cloud traffic from locations of interest to trusted web infrastructure (IP addresses,
ISP hosts).
- Use multi-factor authentication on your cloud services, especially web, customer, or
partner-facing applications.
- Set up DLP policies to identify sensitive data exfiltration to unmanaged devices.
- Monitor for suspicious configuration changes to 3rd party OAuth apps, cloud email and
cloud servers.
