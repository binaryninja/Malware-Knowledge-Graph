Introduction
Cyber attacks on Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) have always been a
major concern due to the immense disruption they have the potential to
cause. The interruption of power, water, or transportation systems can have
a major impact on ordinary citizens and put huge pressure on organizations
and governments to restore systems quickly.
The Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear enrichment program that was
discovered in 2010, an attack on the power grid in Ukraine in 2015, and
the recent attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the U.S., are just some of the
high-profile incidents affecting CNI that have been publicly reported. Cyber
attacks on power grids can cause anxiety due to the potential negative
impacts they can have on ordinary citizens: the attack in Ukraine occurred
in December, cutting out power and heat for citizens in the middle of
Europe’s winter. Thankfully, in that case, power was restored reasonably
quickly, but the fact that attackers were able to gain access to the power
grid to shut it down in the first place was a cause for significant concern.
The recent Colonial Pipeline attack in the U.S. also caused a huge reaction,
leading to people stockpiling gasoline amid fears of a fuel shortage. In a
world where almost all systems are internet connected to some degree,
good cyber security in CNI has never been more important.

Attacks Against Critical Infrastructure

White Paper
This paper will look at some of the most high-profile cyber attacks on CNI we have observed, including the
Colonial Pipeline attack, and some previously unpublished research into an attack campaign aimed at some CNI
infrastructure in a South East Asian country.
We will also look at what Symantec data tells us about malicious activity aimed at the CNI sector, and the steps you
can take to help protect your organization.
Some of the key points covered in this paper:
• The Colonial Pipeline incident and other recent attacks have underlined the disruptive potential of
ransomware for CNI and the pressure that can be exerted on organizations to pay ransoms in an effort to
restore essential services quickly, making them a prime target for ransomware criminals.
• Attacks on CNI are a global issue, with high-profile incidents having occurred in the U.S., Europe, and the
Middle East.
• Symantec data indicates that an increasing number of malicious actors are attempting to attack CNI
organizations, but the number of attackers successfully installing malware on the endpoint in the sector is
trending down.
• Attacks on CNI can be hard to contain or keep under wraps for affected businesses, leading to potential
damage to business reputation as well as major effects on ordinary citizens. This was demonstrated in both
the Colonial Pipeline and Ukraine power grid attacks.
• A comprehensive cyber security strategy with the implementation of policies like network segmentation, Zero
Trust, and multi-factor authentication is essential for businesses in this sector, particularly in order to keep
production networks safe even if corporate networks become infected.
• Malicious actors targeting this sector use living-off-the-land tools and techniques, as well as malware, to
target and infect victims.
• Though rare, we have seen both destructive attacks and attacks with physical impact aimed at organizations
in the CNI sector, so this is something companies in this sector need to be aware of. Due to the wide impact
disruption of organizations in this sector can have, organizations need to be aware they could be the subject
of attacks from highly skilled, nation-state-backed malicious actors.

Methodology
Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) is a broad sector that encompasses a number of different industries. The
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) lists 16 critical infrastructure sectors “whose assets,
systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their
incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national
public health or safety, or any combination thereof.” This includes the following:
• Healthcare and Public Health
• Financial Services
• Food and Agriculture
• Transportation Systems
• Information Technology
• Government Facilities
• Emergency Services
• Dams
• Communications
• Chemical
• Commercial Facilities
• Critical Manufacturing
• Defense Industrial Base
• Energy
• Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste
• Water and Wastewater Systems

However, given the size of some of these sectors, for the purposes of this paper we will be concentrating primarily
on a subset of these sectors, including the following:
• Energy Sector
• Dams
• Chemical
• Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste
• Water and Wastewater Systems
• Critical Manufacturing
• Transportation Systems
• Commercial Facilities

Colonial Pipeline: U.S. Infrastructure Under Attack
On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline, one of the biggest fuel pipelines in the U.S., providing 45% of the fuel consumed
on the East Coast, was forced to shut down operations following a ransomware attack.
The finger of blame for this incident was quickly pointed at a group called Darkside (aka Coreid), a ransomware-asa-service operation that is widely believed to operate from Eastern Europe. This attack attracted a huge number of
headlines in the U.S. and around the globe, a response from the White House, and, seemingly, the shutdown of the
operations of the ransomware gang responsible.

The Attack
The Colonial Pipeline is 5,500 miles long, travels through 14 states and is responsible for providing almost half of the
fuel supply of the East Coast of the U.S. Its shutdown caused alarm among residents of eastern and southeastern
states of the U.S., with fears that a prolonged shutdown could lead to fuel shortages and price hikes. The level of
panic was such that there were reports of gas stations running out of fuel, and people going so far as to fill plastic
bags with gasoline.
In a statement about the attack, Colonial said it temporarily shut down all its pipeline operations after learning it
had been hit by a cyber attack on some of its “information technology” systems. The firm said it “proactively took
certain systems offline to contain the threat.”
The seriousness of the attack was underlined when the government invoked emergency powers in response to the
hack. The Department of Transportation issued an emergency declaration on May 9 in response to the incident
to relax regulations for drivers carrying gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products in 17 states
and the District of Columbia. It allowed them to work extra or more flexible hours to make up for any fuel shortage
related to the pipeline outage.
Thankfully, Colonial was able to restart the pipeline five days after it had shut it down, although it did say it would
take “several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal.”
While it wasn’t initially clear whether or not Colonial had paid a ransom to the attackers, Bloomberg News reported
on May 13 that the company had paid a ransom of $4.4 million. The company reportedly paid the ransom within
hours of the attack occurring, and received a decryption key from the attackers. However, the decryption process
was reportedly so slow that the company also continued to use its own backups to recover from the attack.
Speaking in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on June 8, Colonial
Pipeline’s CEO Joseph Blount defended his decision to pay the ransom to the attackers, stating that he had “put
the interests of the country first.” He also revealed that the attackers gained initial access to the company’s network
through a “legacy VPN” account that the company’s IT team did not know existed. The account was protected with
only a password and did not have multi-factor authentication enabled.

Attacks Against Critical Infrastructure

White Paper
The Attackers
Darkside, which Symantec tracks as Coreid, is a ransomware-as-a-service operation that works with affiliates
to conduct ransomware attacks and takes a share of the profits. Coreid develops the malware and affiliates
carry out the attacks. Like most ransomware actors these days, Coreid carries out what are known as “double
extortion” attacks, where they steal victims’ data and threaten to publish it to further pressure victims into paying
the ransom demand. An unusual aspect of Coreid’s operation is that it claims to prohibit affiliates from attacking
certain organizations, including hospitals, hospices, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and government
agencies.
The group was first seen in August 2020, but a new level of interest was drawn to the group in the wake of the
attack on Colonial Pipeline. Coreid had been noted for the level of “professionalism” employed by the group since it
emerged, with the gang reportedly even providing a phone number and a help desk to facilitate negotiations with
victims. This “professionalism” was evident in the wake of the Colonial attack too, with the group issuing a press
release after it was named as the perpetrator of this attack. The group said it was “apolitical” and not associated
with any government, and also stated that its goal was to make money, and not create problems for society. It said
that in the future it would introduce moderation and check each company that its partners want to encrypt to
avoid “social consequences.”
Coreid is believed to be a financially-motivated cyber crime group, and is not thought to be nation-state-backed or
interested in cyber espionage. While Symantec cannot definitively say where Coreid is based, public reports state
the group is based in Eastern Europe, with Russia considered to be its most likely base. The group does check for
the language used on infected machines and does not proceed with an attack if Russian or several other languages
spoken in former Soviet bloc nations are installed on the machine.
Coreid is thought to be a very profitable ransomware group, having reportedly taken in around $90 million.
Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic found and analyzed payments made to Coreid from 47 different Bitcoin wallets,
with the payments totaling $90 million, which would mean the average ransom paid to Coreid was approximately
$1.9 million. This would put Coreid at the high end of ransomware earners that we have seen, with this amount of
money also collected in a reasonably short period of time, considering the group only emerged in August 2020.
The Coreid operators are believed to keep 10% to 25% of the profits of attacks, with the rest going to affiliates,
so the malware developers themselves are estimated to have made approximately $15.5 million. Nevertheless, it
is difficult to determine exactly how much money is made by ransomware actors, so the true figure may be even
higher.
However, it appears the Colonial Pipeline attack may have been an attack too far for the group, with Darksupp, an
admin for the Coreid group, announcing on an underground forum on May 14 that the group had lost access to its
data leaks site, payment servers, and content delivery network (CDN) servers following law enforcement action in
the wake of the Colonial attack. This news came after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that countries harboring
ransomware networks must take action to shut them down. “We have been in direct communication with Moscow
about the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,” he said.
The group was paid $9.4 million in ransoms—from Colonial Pipeline ($4.4 million) and German chemical company
Brenntag ($5 million)—in the weeks before it shut down, causing speculation that the group may have decided
to cash out and keep those profits rather than sharing with affiliates. However, on June 7 it was announced that
authorities in the U.S. had recovered 63.7 of the 75 bitcoins Colonial had paid to Coreid. The Department of Justice
said the FBI recovered the money after they gained access to one account’s private key.
There is no doubt the increased attention on the group following the Colonial attack put it under pressure, but
whether this is in fact the last we see of these ransomware actors remains to be seen.

Impact
As well as the obvious and immediate impact of this attack on Colonial itself, and the disruption to fuel supplies, the
attack was also followed by some political pronouncements.
U.S. President Biden signed an executive order (EO) on May 12 aimed at modernizing U.S. defenses against cyber
attacks, and allowing more timely access to information needed for law enforcement to conduct investigations. The
34-page EO followed several attacks targeting U.S. interests over the preceding few months, including the attack
on Colonial, and the SolarWinds supply chain attacks.
The Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity called for a number of actions, including:
• Removing barriers to threat information sharing between government and the private sector
• Modernizing and implementing stronger cyber security standards in the federal government
• Improving software supply chain security
• Establishing a cyber security safety review board
• Creating a standard playbook for responding to cyber incidents
• Improving detection of cyber security incidents on federal government networks
• Improving investigative and remediation capabilities
The White House said the EO was the “the first of many ambitious steps the Administration is taking to modernize
national cyber defenses.”
In the wake of the Colonial attack, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security also issued a Security Directive
for the oil and gas pipeline industry. The Directive, which will be administered by the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), was published on May 27, 2021,
and replaced voluntary guidelines that had been in place for more than a decade.
The Directive requires critical pipeline owners and operators to report any confirmed or potential cyber security
incidents to CISA. They are also required to have a designated cyber security coordinator who is available 24/7. The
Directive also stipulated that pipeline owners and operators needed to review their practices to identify any gaps
and related remediation measures, and report the results to TSA and CISA within 30 days. TSA said it would also
consider follow-on mandatory measures in the future that would “further support the pipeline industry in enhancing
its cyber security.” When announcing the directive, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas
referenced the Colonial attack, stating: “The recent ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline demonstrates
that the cyber security of pipeline systems is critical to our homeland security.” He also said the DHS would work
closely with the private sector to “increase the resilience of our nation’s critical infrastructure.”
The Department of Justice (DoJ) also established a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force in the wake of
the attack, which it said was “established to investigate, disrupt and prosecute ransomware and digital extortion
activity.” The DoJ also said that ransomware incidents would be given a similar priority as investigations into acts of
terrorism.
The Colonial attack also had an impact outside of the U.S., with the South Korean government ordering a review of
the cyber security preparedness of its energy infrastructure. South Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy,
Moon Seung-wook, said that in the wake of the disruption at Colonial it was “necessary to thoroughly examine
whether cyber security preparations and countermeasures for our energy-related infrastructure are properly in
place.” He ordered all operators of oil pipelines, power grids, gas pipelines, and emergency response systems to
check the status of their systems and report back on their findings.
The Japanese government also announced it would introduce new regulations for 14 critical infrastructure sectors
to bolster cyber defenses, in the wake of the Colonial attack. The sectors included areas like telecommunications,
electricity, railroads, government services, and healthcare. The government will require operators of such key
infrastructure to address national security concerns when procuring foreign-made equipment.
The wide-ranging impact of the Colonial attack is interesting. It appears to have raised awareness worldwide of
the dangers posed by potential cyber attacks on companies involved in CNI, and has led to authorities in the U.S.,
particularly, showing a determination to crack down on ransomware attackers to a degree we hadn’t previously seen.

Attacks Against Critical Infrastructure

Case Study: Concerted Attacks on CNI in South East Asia

White Paper

Case Study:
Concerted Attacks on CNI in South East Asia
Symantec researchers observed attacks on a
number of organizations that were part of the
CNI sector in a South East Asian country. These
attacks were ongoing since at least November
2020, and continued right up to March 2021.
Intelligence gathering was thought to be the
likely motivation in these attacks.
Victims were seen in multiple organizations
that all fall under the umbrella of CNI, including
in the areas of water, power, defense, and
communications. There are some indications that
the attacker is based in China, but the activity
cannot be attributed to any one particular group.
There are numerous indications that the attacks
on the different organizations were carried out by
the same attacker, including:

Water Company
The first activity we saw in the attack on this
organization was suspicious use of Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI); there is no
indication of what infection vector was used to
gain initial access to the machine. A legitimate
free multimedia player called PotPlayer Mini was
exploited by the attackers to load a malicious DLL.
FireEye has previously published research about
how this player was susceptible to DLL search
order hijacking. DLL search order hijacking is not
a new technique, but we do still see it frequently
leveraged by attackers to insert malicious
files onto victim machines. We saw PotPlayer
Mini added as a service to launch a file called
potplayermini.exe, we then saw multiple dual-use
and hacking tools launched, including:

• The geographic and sector links of the
affected organizations

• ProcDump

• The presence of certain artifacts on
machines in the different organizations,
including a downloader (found in two of the
organizations), and a keylogger (found in
three of the organizations)

• Mimikatz

• The same IP address is also seen in attacks
on two of the organizations
Credential theft and lateral movement on victim
networks seemed to be a key aim of the attacker,
who made extensive use of living-off-the-land
tools in this campaign. While we do not know
what the initial infection vector used by the
attacker to get onto targeted networks was, we do
see how they moved through infected networks.

• PsExec

ProcDump was used for credential theft by
abusing the LSASS.exe process, and domain
shares were enumerated using net view. We
then observed a suspected tunneling tool being
launched on the system. The machine targeted by
the attackers in this instance had tools on it that
indicate it may have been involved in the design of
SCADA systems.
Power Company
Similar activity was seen in a company in the
power sector. In that instance too, PotPlayer Mini
was exploited to carry out DLL search order
hijacking and ProcDump was deployed alongside
another payload that we suspect was malware.
We also saw the attacker once again carrying out
credential theft by using ProcDump of the LSASS.
exe process. There were indications here too
that this machine may also have been involved in
engineering design.
There was some file overlap between the attacks
on both the water and power company as well as
similar tactics used—pointing to the same actor
being behind both events.

White Paper

Communications Company
An interesting aspect of this attack was that the
attacker appeared to have exploited a different
legitimate tool, Google Chrome Frame, with
suspicious files appearing where chrome_frame_
helper.exe was the parent file. Google Chrome
Frame is a plugin for Internet Explorer that
enables rendering the full browser canvas using
Google Chrome’s rendering engine.
It wasn’t clear if Google Chrome Frame was
already present on the machine or if it was
introduced by the attacker, however, it was the
parent file of legitimate as well as suspicious files.
PotPlayer Mini also appeared to be exploited
on this machine by the attacker for malicious
purposes.
PAExec, a tool similar to PsExec, launched at.exe
(a Windows task scheduler) in order to schedule
execution of chrome_frame_helper.exe as a task.
WMI was used to run chrome_frame_helper.
exe and perform credential theft by dumping
LSASS. PsExec and WMIC were also used for
lateral movement and to launch chrome_frame_
helper.exe against an internal IP address. PsExec
also launched it to schedule execution of an
unknown batch file as a daily task, and chrome_
frame_helper.exe was also used to launch the
SharpHound domain trust enumeration tool
and other suspicious files. PsExec was also seen
executing what appeared to be Mimikatz for
suspected credential theft.

WMI was used to run chrome_frame_helper.exe to
execute a net.exe command to connect a hidden
C$ share. This type of share is not visible when
viewing another computer’s shares. However,
it is still accessible if the name of the hidden
share is known. Persistence was created for
chrome_frame_helper.exe as a scheduled task—
GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore4f23—with the file
disguised as chrome_proxy1.exe.
Defense Organization
In the defense organization we once again
saw PotPlayer Mini exploited for DLL search
order hijacking, as well as seeing some file
overlaps between this organization and the
communications and water companies.
Conclusion
While we cannot definitively say what the
end goal of the attacker was in these attacks,
information stealing seems like the likeliest motive,
given the activity we did see (credential stealing,
lateral movement), and the types of machines
targeted in some of the organizations (those
involved in design or engineering). The ability of
the attacker to maintain a stealthy presence on
the targeted networks for a number of months
indicates they were skilled. Certain artifacts found
on the victim machines indicate the attacker may
be based in China, though it is not possible with
the information we have to definitively attribute
these attacks to a named actor.

What the Data Tells Us
When we examine the malicious activity targeted at our CNI customers, it would appear that an increasing number
of attackers are attempting to attack CNI organizations, but the number of attackers successfully gaining access
and installing malware on the endpoint in this sector is trending down.
Network-based detections indicate that malicious activity targeted at CNI organizations is on the rise. Attacks
blocked on the network by our Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technologies help reveal information about the
extent of malicious activity on organizations’ networks. If a machine on a network becomes infected, the malware is
likely to attempt to contact a command and control (C&C) server, which can also trigger these detections. Looking
at the number of network detections attempting to contact a C&C server gives an indication of the number of
infected machines on a network and a picture of the extent of malicious activity in a sector.
Network-based activity trended upwards over the time period we looked at, with an increase in June 2020 carrying
through to February 2021. While these detections dropped slightly in March and April 2021, the overall trend is still
increasing.

However, in something of a contrast, reviewing the data for malware activity on the endpoint in the CNI sector
since the beginning of 2020 to April 2021 doesn’t reveal any particularly dramatic trends. Malware activity on the
endpoint in the sector has remained reasonably steady in that time period. We saw something of a spike in May
2020, but after that, activity returned to a fairly steady level, even declining slightly.

When we look at the top 10 detections being triggered by CNI customers, a lot of those detections are heuristic

China and the U.S. were the countries where we saw the highest number of endpoint malware detections in the CNI
sector, with those two countries combined accounting for 80% of the top 10 detections. However, the presence of

Ransomware
Ransomware activity aimed at organizations in the CNI sector remained reasonably steady over the period
examined, although there was a spike in May 2020, with ransomware numbers somewhat elevated for several of the
middle months of 2020. While we did see a small drop in malicious activity in general at the very beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, as threat actors presumably also adjusted to a new way of working and targeting victims, this
drop did not last long, and malicious activity did, in many cases, return to and even exceed pre-pandemic levels. It
is possible the May spike was a return to activity for actors after a small decline in March and April.

While the ransomware numbers may not appear to be huge, ransomware attacks now are a lot more targeted,
with the days of mass spamming ransomware campaigns largely a thing of the past. Most ransomware groups
these days spend a long time planning attacks, potentially spending a long time on compromised systems carrying
out reconnaissance and exfiltrating data before deploying ransomware. Due to the large paydays offered by
ransomware attacks now, malicious ransomware actors tend to carry out fewer attacks for greater rewards.

Attacks Against Critical Infrastructure

White Paper
While the number of targeted ransomware attacks aimed at organizations in the CNI sector over the period we
examined may seem low—averaging at around two per month—just one attack every few weeks can easily give
attackers the outcome they want. It should also be noted that the data shown in Figure 8 is only a representative
sample of the overall number of attacks involving targeted ransomware. Most targeted ransomware operators
recompile their payloads for every new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack
may be blocked by a generic or machine learning-generated detection signature rather than a detection linked to
that ransomware family.
The Colonial Pipeline attack demonstrated that just one ransomware attack on a key organization can lead to
wide-ranging disruption, and potentially a big payday for attackers. JBS Foods, one of the world’s largest meat
producers, paid $11 million to the REvil ransomware gang on June 1, 2021, after a ransomware attack on the
company encrypted some of its operations in North America and Australia, leading to significant disruption. REvil
had also threatened to leak data it said it had stolen from the company.
For organizations that become infected with ransomware—particularly when they are in critical sectors like
energy, food production, or health—trying to balance the risks of not paying with the knowledge that paying
only encourages attackers to continue carrying out these kinds of attacks can be a difficult balancing act. An
organization’s desire and sometimes need to avoid long-term disruption, and potentially recovery costs significantly
greater than the cost of paying a ransom, can lead to big paydays for ransomware criminals.

Attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
In 2021, malware detections tell only part of the malicious activity story, with the popularity of living-off-the-land
techniques among malicious actors these days meaning that a lot of malicious activity can occur without any
malicious tools being deployed. For this reason, Symantec Cloud Analytics doesn’t just detect malicious tools, but
rather it draws on intelligence gathered from analyst investigations and leverages advanced machine learning to
identify and block patterns of suspicious activity. It then classifies all incidents with a MITRE ATT&CK® technique
name. With millions of incidents logged each year, it is possible to form a picture of what the most frequently used
techniques are.

The top 10 MITRE techniques used in attacks against CNI customers are familiar names that we frequently see
leveraged by malicious actors in a wide range of attacks. PowerShell, for example, the technique we see leveraged
most often by attackers, is by far the most popular dual-use tool used by attackers. It is a powerful and versatile
tool for malicious actors, but it is also widely used for legitimate purposes. Malicious usage still only accounts for a
small percentage of overall PowerShell usage, meaning that attackers abusing it are often able to hide in plain sight
on victim machines.
Living-off-the-land techniques allow attackers to minimize malware usage, deploying it only when necessary and
sometimes, as often in the case of ransomware, at such a late stage in the attack that the victim has little or no time
to respond and stop the attack. The popularity of living-off-the-land tools for attackers is demonstrated in the
case study earlier in the paper, where the attackers made wide use of living-off-the-land tools and techniques in
their attack chain.
Activity like that is why having protection in place that can spot suspicious activity before malware is deployed is
important for organizations striving to keep their networks safe.

Other Noteworthy Attacks on CNI
While extremely high-profile, the attack on Colonial Pipeline was not the first impactful attack on CNI infrastructure
we have seen.

Stuxnet and the Threat of “Cyber-Physical” Attacks
Probably one of the most famous cyber attacks to ever occur, the Stuxnet attack is believed to have begun in late
2007 when the digital weapon was deployed against centrifuges at a uranium enrichment plant. That attack was
discovered and widely reported on in 2010. The immense sophistication of the attack meant that the presumption
was that a nation state was behind it, with the Stuxnet attack now widely believed to have been powered by a
cyber weapon developed over the course of a number of years in a collaborative effort between the U.S. and Israel.
Stuxnet was the first example of a cyber attack having a physical impact, damaging, as it did, centrifuges at a
nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran. Stuxnet worked by modifying the centrifuge speeds, causing them to
speed up and become damaged or destroyed. The output at the nuclear plant was reported as dropping by a third
during the time it was infected with Stuxnet. Stuxnet was a highly targeted attack that was only ever intended to
infect the targeted networks but an error in the code meant it spread to a computer that had been connected to
the centrifuges and then made its way onto the internet to spread further. However, as Stuxnet was specifically
programmed to target Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling programmable logic controllers (PLCs), it
caused little damage outside of the targeted networks.
Stuxnet showed for the first time in real life that it was possible for “cyber” attacks to cross over and become
“physical” attacks with a real-world impact. The possibility of this occurring was—and remains—a major fear for
governments and corporations worldwide. The sophistication of Stuxnet showed that, while not easy to execute, it
was possible to carry out attacks like this.
For a long time Stuxnet appeared to be an outlier, and we didn’t see another cyber attack causing physical
damage to infrastructure until 2014. Just before Christmas that year, a report was released revealing that hackers
had struck an unnamed steel mill in Germany. They manipulated and disrupted the control systems in the mill so
much that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in what was described as “massive” damage.
Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which issued the report about the incident, indicated that
the attackers gained access to the steel mill through the plant’s business network, then successively gained access
to the production network, which allowed them to access systems controlling plant equipment. The attackers were
believed to have gained initial access to the corporate network through a spear-phishing email. Once they had
an initial foothold they were able to explore the company’s networks and eventually compromise a “multitude”
of systems, including industrial components on the production network. The report said that as a result of this
unauthorized access the plant was “unable to shut down a blast furnace in a regulated manner” which resulted in
“massive damage to the system.”

Attacks Against Critical Infrastructure

White Paper
Authorities in Germany did say at the time that the attackers appeared to possess knowledge of industrial control
systems, however, it is not clear if causing destructive physical damage to the steel mill was part of the attacker’s
plan, or if the incident was collateral damage of their presence on the network.
If it was accidental, it demonstrates that it isn’t just extremely sophisticated attackers like those behind Stuxnet that
organizations need to worry about causing physical damage. It is unlikely that all the malware used to infiltrate ICS
and other networks will be as well designed as Stuxnet, leading to the possibility that incidents that lead to realworld damage could be unintentionally caused as collateral damage.
While Stuxnet took elaborate steps in order to gain access to air-gapped networks, the attackers who targeted
the German steel mill appear to have been able to jump from the corporate network to the production side of the
plant. Incidents like this serve to underline the importance of good cyber practices like network segmentation and
Zero Trust policies, so that if attackers compromise one part of your network they do not gain access to the entire
system.

Blackout: The Dangers of Power Grid Attacks
The attack on the Ukraine power grid took place on December 23, 2015, and was the first confirmed hack to bring
down a power grid. Such an attack had been long feared given the immense disruption such an outage could
cause. That this attack took place in the depths of Europe’s winter underlined the seriousness of the situation, with
the average temperature in Ukraine in December often dipping below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius).
The attack on the Ukrainian power grid was very sophisticated, with the attackers thought to have been on the
power grid systems for several months before they deployed the malware. The attack began with a spear-phishing
campaign targeting IT staff and system administrators working for multiple companies responsible for distributing
electricity throughout Ukraine. The email had an attachment that contained malicious macros; if this was opened
a malicious backdoor called BlackEnergy was downloaded onto the corporate network. However, this only gave
hackers access to the corporate network, and it is understood that the targeted power distribution companies in
Ukraine did have network segmentation in place, with a firewall separating the corporate network from the SCADA
network that controlled the power grid. However, the attackers explored the corporate network, conducting
reconnaissance and eventually gaining access to the Windows Domain Controllers, where they were able to harvest
worker credentials for the VPNs used to remotely log in to the SCADA network. As workers logging remotely into
the SCADA network weren’t required to use multi-factor authentication, once the attackers had access to those
credentials they were able to log in to the SCADA network.
This shows the importance of having all the different facets of your organization’s cyber security strategy
implemented. While the power grid companies in Ukraine were doing the right thing by having their networks
segregated, the fact they didn’t have multi-factor authentication set up for all workers logging remotely into the
SCADA network meant that attackers were ultimately able to overcome that hurdle to gain access to the SCADA
network anyway.
Once on the SCADA network, the attackers went to the trouble of replacing the legitimate firmware on Serial-toEthernet converters in order to prevent the operators from sending remote commands to re-close breakers once
a blackout occurred. They were then ready to carry out their attacks, opening circuit breakers to plunge tracts of
Ukraine into darkness. They also flooded the power companies’ customer call centers with phone calls to take them
offline when customers wanted to contact them. The attackers also deployed a wiper malware called KillDisk to
wipe files from operator stations to render them inoperable.
Ultimately in this incident, the attackers hit three power distribution centers, took around 60 substations offline,
and left almost a quarter of a million Ukrainians in darkness. In this instance, authorities were able to get the lights
turned back on quickly—with the longest outage lasting six hours—but the impact of the attacks were felt in the
power distribution centers for several months as several actions could no longer be performed remotely. Given the
skill levels of the actors in this attack and the access they achieved on the network, the consequences of this attack
could have been a lot more serious than they were, and it certainly served as a warning to power companies of the
level of destruction attackers could deploy on power grids.

White Paper
While this attack occurred in a European country, and not the U.S., similar environments are likely to exist in U.S.
power distribution centers, meaning the threat of such an attack is there wherever in the world your organization
may be located. While we have not yet seen U.S. electricity disrupted by a cyber attack, an AP investigation in
the same year the Ukraine attack took place showed that the U.S. power grid was certainly of interest to foreign
adversaries, a fact that is unlikely to have changed in the last few years.

Shamoon: Destructive Attacks Threaten Oil Industry in Middle East
The threat widely known as Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first appeared in 2012, when it was used in a targeted attack
against at least one organization in the energy sector in Saudi Arabia. Shamoon is notable because it is a wiper
malware that corrupts files on an infected machine and overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) in order to
make the computer unusable. Those deploying Shamoon appear to have destruction as their goal, as opposed to
espionage or financial gain, the more common motives for cyber attacks.
Shamoon was seen again in 2016, when a slightly modified version of the malware was once again used in
destructive attacks aimed at the Saudi energy sector. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their MBRs wiped
and replaced with an image of a burning U.S. flag. The 2016 attacks instead used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi,
a three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015. The attacks appeared timed to
cause maximum destruction. The malware was configured to trigger on Thursday night, local time, on November
17, 2016. The Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped after most staff
had left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the attack was complete. It also appeared the
attackers had done a significant amount of preparatory work for the operation, as the malware was configured with
credentials that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations, allowing it to move laterally across
machines on the network.
Shamoon reappeared again in 2018, again focusing on targets in the Middle East, with victims that time in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as Saudi Arabia. Once again, the victims operated in the oil and gas sector.
However, these attacks were slightly different from prior incidents as they involved a new, second piece of wiping
malware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware would delete and overwrite files on the infected computer, while Shamoon
itself erased the computer’s MBR. The addition of the Filerase malware made the attacks even more destructive as
deleting the files before erasing the MBR meant they could not be recovered.
Although attacks involving destructive malware such as Shamoon are relatively rare, they can be highly disruptive
for the targeted organization, potentially knocking mission-critical computers offline and leading to the loss of
important files. The fact that Shamoon seems to reappear every few years means that corporations, particularly any
that have operations in the Middle East, need to be aware of this threat and prepared, with comprehensive backups
and a robust security strategy in place.
Shamoon attacks are believed to be associated with malicious actors operating out of Iran, with the attacks often
tending to coincide with periods of heightened instability in the region. The fact the attackers also seemed to have
been evolving their attacks, with the addition of the Filerase malware in the most recent wave of attacks, should
also be a cause of heightened vigilance against attacks of this type.
Iranian hackers were also linked to an intrusion at the Bowman Avenue Dam, a small dam in New York State, in 2013.
Media reports said the hackers were believed to have gained access to the dam through a cellular modem. The
hackers reportedly didn’t take control of the dam but probed the system, possibly discovering information about
how the computers running the flood control system worked. This intrusion occurred in 2013, but information about
it didn’t emerge until 2015. While no damage was caused during this attack, it serves to demonstrate the interest
foreign adversaries have in U.S. critical infrastructure organizations.

Conclusion
The Colonial Pipeline attack underlined that ransomware, with its ability to shut down operations and cause
significant business impact, can be just as disruptive a threat as the so-called “destructive” malware that we saw
deployed in, for example, the Shamoon and Stuxnet attacks. A recent Conti ransomware attack on the Irish Health
Service Executive (HSE), the country’s national healthcare service, also demonstrated how disruptive ransomware
attacks can be. The attack on the HSE led to the cancellation of many services and major disruption, with
authorities there vowing not to pay a ransom and predicting it would take many weeks for the service to recover
from the attack. Targeted ransomware attacks that also steal data and demand large ransoms are one of the
biggest cyber security threats for all sectors at the moment, and CNI is no exception.
The impact on the public that can be caused by cyber attacks on CNI industries, such as essential services being
forced offline for a period, also means that attacks on organizations in this industry can be hard to keep from the
public and media, potentially leading to awkward questions and possible damage to businesses’ reputations.
Meanwhile, a somewhat unique challenge faced by CNI is the effect cyber-physical attacks could have on the
sector, with the prospect of attackers being able to destroy equipment or gain control of things like dams or
electricity substations a particular danger that this sector has to deal with.
We have seen companies in the CNI sector from the U.S. to Europe to the Middle East targeted with serious and
disruptive attacks, so there is no region in which CNI organizations can assume they are not under threat of a
serious cyber attack. All these threats underline that organizations operating in this sector need to have a robust
cyber security strategy in place in order to keep their networks, equipment, and customers, safe.

Mitigation
Symantec security experts recommend users observe the following best practices to protect their networks:
• Look to deploy an integrated cyber defense platform that shares threat data from endpoint, email, web, cloud
apps, and infrastructure.
• Ensure multi-factor authentication is enabled for all accounts using your network.
• Monitor the use of dual-use tools inside your network.
• Ensure you have the latest version of PowerShell and you have logging enabled.
• Restrict access to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services by only allowing RDP from specific known IP
addresses.
• Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time
credentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.
• Ensure any legacy applications that are no longer in use are removed from all machines on your network so
they cannot be misused.
• Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally
undetected through a network.
• Use application allow lists where applicable.
• Implement offline backups that are onsite. Make sure you have backups that are not connected to the
network to prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.
• Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business.
• Educate staff to ensure they understand cyber security principles and do not engage in any behaviors that
may put network security at risk.
