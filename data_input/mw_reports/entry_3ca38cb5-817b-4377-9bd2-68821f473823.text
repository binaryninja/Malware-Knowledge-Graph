NICKEL targeting government organizations across Latin America and
Europe
microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/06/nickel-targeting-government-organizations-across-latin-america-and-europe/
December 6, 2021

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has observed NICKEL, a China-based threat actor, targeting
governments, diplomatic entities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) across Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Europe, and North America. MSTIC has been tracking NICKEL since 2016 and observed some common
activity with other actors known in the security community as APT15, APT25, and KeChang. Today, the Microsoft
Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) announced the successful seizure of a set of NICKEL-operated websites and disruption of
their ongoing attacks targeting organizations in 29 countries, following a court order from the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia granting Microsoft the authority to seize these sites.
MSTIC has tracked the current NICKEL operations, including attacks against government organizations, diplomatic
entities, and NGOs, since September 2019. During this time, NICKEL activity has been observed across several
countries, with a large amount of activity targeting Central and South American governments. Notably, NICKEL has
achieved long-term access to several targets, allowing NICKEL to conduct activities such as regularly scheduled
exfiltration of data. As China’s influence around the world continues to grow and the nation establishes bilateral
relations with more countries and extends partnerships in support of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, we assess that
China-based threat actors will continue to target customers in government, diplomatic, and NGO sectors to gain new
insights, likely in pursuit of economic espionage or traditional intelligence collection objectives. Portions of the NICKEL
activity we are highlighting have also been blogged about by our colleagues at ESET.

As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft continues to notify customers that have been targeted or
compromised, providing them with the information they need to help secure their organizations. To reduce the potential
impact of this NICKEL activity, Microsoft encourages our customers to immediately review the activity and guidance
below, then implement risk mitigations, harden environments, and investigate suspicious behaviors that match the
tactics described in this blog. MSTIC will continue to observe, monitor, and notify affected customers and partners,
when possible, through our nation-state notification process.

Observed activity
MSTIC has observed NICKEL actors using exploits against unpatched systems to compromise remote access
services and appliances. Upon successful intrusion, they have used credential dumpers or stealers to obtain legitimate
credentials, which they used to gain access to victim accounts. NICKEL actors created and deployed custom malware
that allowed them to maintain persistence on victim networks over extended periods of time. MSTIC has also observed
NICKEL perform frequent and scheduled data collection and exfiltration from victim networks.
NICKEL successfully compromises networks using attacks on internet-facing web applications running on unpatched
Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint. They also attack remote access infrastructure, such as unpatched VPN
appliances, as referenced in the FireEye April 2021 blog detailing a 0-day vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN that has
since been patched.
After gaining an initial foothold on a compromised system, the NICKEL actors routinely performed reconnaissance on
the network, working to gain access to additional accounts or higher-value systems. NICKEL typically deployed a
keylogger to capture credentials from users on compromised systems. We’ve observed NICKEL using Mimikatz,
WDigest (an older authentication method that allows the attacker access to credentials in clear text), NTDSDump, and
other password dumping tools to gather credentials on a targeted system and from target browsers.

Deploying malware for command and control
MSTIC tracks multiple malware families used by NICKEL for command and control as Neoichor, Leeson, NumbIdea,
NullItch, and Rokum.
The Leeson, Neoichor, and NumbIdea malware families typically use the Internet Explorer (IE) COM interface to
connect and receive commands from hardcoded C2 servers. Due to their reliance on IE, these malware families
intentionally configure the browser settings by modifying the following registry entries:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main]
Start Page = “about:blank”
DisableFirstRunCustomize = 1
RunOnceComplete = 1
RunOnceHasShown = 1
Check_Associations = 1
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Recovery]
AutoRecover = 0
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Privacy]
ClearBrowsingHistoryOnExit = 1
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Connection Wizard]
Completed = 1
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap]
IEHarden = 0

When connecting to the C2 servers, the URL requests follow these formats:

2/9

http[:]//<C2>?id=<5-digit-rand><system-specific-string>
http[:]//<C2>?setssion==<rand><GetTickCount>
http[:]//<C2>?newfrs%dsetssion=<rand><GetTickCount>
http[:]//<C2>/index.htm?content=<base64-system-specifc-string>&id=<num>

A typical response from the C2 server is a legitimate-looking webpage containing the string “!DOCTYPE html”, which
the malware checks. The malware then locates a Base64-encoded blob, which it decodes and proceeds to load as a
shellcode.
For the Neoichor family, the malware checks for internet connectivity by contacting bing.com with the request format
bing.com?id=<GetTickCount> and drops files as ~atemp and ~btemp containing error codes and debug resources.
The NICKEL implants are backdoors capable of collecting system information, such as:
IP address
OS version
System language ID
Computer name
Signed-in username
They implement basic backdoor functionalities, including:
Launching a process
Uploading a file
Downloading a file
Executing a shellcode in memory
MSTIC has observed NICKEL drop their malware into existing installed software paths. They did this to make their
malware appear to be files used for an installed application. The following are example paths:
C:\Program Files\Realtek\Audio\HDA\AERTSr.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\FoxitRdr64.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Flash Player\AddIns\airappinstaller\airappinstall.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat Reader DC\Reader\AcroRd64.exe

Using compromised credentials for routine email collection
NICKEL used compromised credentials to sign into victims’ Microsoft 365 accounts through normal sign-ins with a
browser and the legacy Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocol to review and collect victim emails. MSTIC has
observed successful NICKEL sign-ins to compromised accounts through commercial VPN providers as well as from
actor-controlled infrastructure. The activity graphed below shows NICKEL sign-in activity happening most frequently
on Monday through Friday from 12:00 AM UTC (8:00 AM China Standard time) through 09:00 AM UTC (5:00 PM
China Standard Time). There are also possible indications of a shift-based scheduling model based on the observed
limited set of activity during a typical weekend.

Evidence of routine host data collection
In several observed cases, NICKEL was seen performing regular data collection for exfiltration purposes. Their activity
included looking in directories of interest for new files added since the last time they collected data. In the example
below, NICKEL was collecting data that had been created or modified multiple times over a one-month period. For
instance, on October 22, NICKEL looked for files that had been created since October 19 in multiple folders.
Previously, on October 20 they had done the same thing looking for files that were modified or created since October
13.
Here are recent examples of NICKEL’s routine data collection:

After collecting the data in a central directory, the attackers then used either a renamed rar.exe or 7z.exe to archive
the files. NICKEL also frequently used keyboard walks as a password for their archived data collections. The following
are examples of RAR archiving for exfiltration:

Here is an example of 7zip archiving for exfiltration:

Microsoft will continue to monitor NICKEL activity and implement product protections for our customers. The IOCs,
current detections, and advanced protections in place across our security products are detailed below.

Recommended defenses
The following guidance can help mitigate the techniques and threat activity described in this blog:
Block legacy authentication protocols in Azure Active Directory – especially Exchange Web Services (EWS)
Enable multi-factor authentication to mitigate compromised credentials.
For Office 365 users, see multi-factor authentication support.
For Consumer and Personal email accounts, see how to use two-step verification.
Use passwordless solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure accounts.
Review and enforce recommended Exchange Online access policies.
Block ActiveSync clients from bypassing Conditional Access policies.
Block all incoming traffic from anonymizing services, where possible.
Turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit activity associated with this threat:
Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)
