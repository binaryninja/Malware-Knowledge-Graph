Key Takeaways
TangleBot is leveraging COVID-19 and electricity-themed lures in its effort to convince
users to click on the malicious link and install the malware.
The SMS links are only malicious via Android mobile devices and are currently only
being sent to US and Canadian users.
TangleBot, while sharing some similarities with the Medusa malware, has some key
distinguishing features that make it particularly threatening, such as its advanced
behaviors and transmission abilities and its use of a string decryption routine as part of
its obfuscation.

Overview
On the heels of a busy summer tracking the rapid spread of FluBot mobile malware across
Europe and Australia, Proofpoint researchers have observed yet another malware campaign,
dubbed TangleBot, designed to steal mobile users’ sensitive information. TangleBot started
off using ever popular Covid-themed lures to trick Android users in Canada and the United
States into installing malware on their devices. Proofpoint threat analysts recently covered a
high-level overview of TangleBot on the Cloudmark blog, warning mobile users of this threat.
In this blog, researchers dive into the malware, detailing what makes it interesting and why it
has been coined TangleBot.
Proofpoint took notice of this malware prior to widespread distribution and worked with our
partners at Google to ensure Google Play Protect adequately detects the software (Figure 1)
helping ensure protection for the greater global community.

The SMS Lure
Proofpoint analysts first detected this attack in early September 2021. The initial lures came
in the form of Covid-19 SMS messages masquerading as legitimate medical
notifications. The messages contained links to URLs pertaining to Covid-19 or vaccine
information and appeared legitimate to unsuspecting users.
A follow-up campaign has been detected using messaging related to a potential power
outage and targeting users of hydroelectric plants across the United States and Canada.

Installation
If users click the link contained within the text message, threat actors use the timetested method of advising users Adobe Flash Player needs an update to display the
content. There is obviously no need to worry
that Adobe stopped supporting this product after December 31, 2020, or that Adobe
Flash Player has not been supported on any mobile device since 2012. Threat actors play on
this lack of understanding to help eliminate unsatisfactory targets who may uncover the ruse
too quickly.
Unsuspecting users are presented a series of dialogue boxes requesting acceptance of
the permissions and installation from unknown sources. Proofpoint analysts counted no less
than nine dialogue boxes that users must click prior to the full installation of the malware.
While this may seem like a lot, the lesson learned from the FluBot outbreak over the summer
is that users tend to disregard the multiple warnings and permissions and still download and
install software from unknown sources. The following nine images highlight the experience of
a victim from APK download (the installer file for Android) through the completed installation
of the software.

Permissions
TangleBot requests access to many permissions allowing for eavesdropping and
the exfiltration of sensitive data. These permissions grant the ability for the malware
to modify device configuration settings, record user activity and tracking location, and
transmit the stolen information back to systems controlled by the threat actor.

Behind the Scenes
Outside of the observable malware behavior, there are several activities taking place,
including the setup and configuration of the malware, and the capabilities of
the threat actor post-infection. Below we will look at a few of these capabilities.

Command and Control (C2) - Setup
The threat actor uses social media messaging to deliver covert C2 infrastructure information
to infected devices. The messaging in the detected sample arrives via Telegram but could
easily be replaced by another online service of the threat actor’s choice. The information is
disseminated within cryptic posts that would be unrecognizable without proper context. The
malware contacts defined patterns within the specified social media pages. Once located,
the malware can receive threat actor-supplied instructions.

Command and Control (C2) – Commands
After establishing connectivity with the infected device, dozens of instructions are used to
interact with and exfiltrate data and other sensitive information.
Specific instructions allow for the control and monitoring of infected devices, manipulation of
user data and browser activity, and the theft of confidential information. The following is a
short list of a few available C2 commands:
Call and SMS control

Keylogging capability

Display Play Protect Settings

HTML injection

USSD messaging

Set screen brightness

Screen capture

Running apps

Remove Admin

Camera capture

Track settings

Functionality
TangleBot allows the threat actor full control over infected devices. The control afforded by
the malware allows for the monitoring and recording of all aspects of user activity, including
websites visited, collection of typed passwords, audio and video from the
microphone/camera, and can harvest data including SMS activity and stored content. This
allows for a full range of surveillance and collection capabilities.

HTML Injection
HTML injection is used to generate fake application overlay screens. These screens may
perfectly resemble the login pages of financial institutions and are designed to compromise
the credentials of unsuspecting users. This type of overlay functionality
is likely what caused widespread financial loss from the FluBot malware family. Below is an
example of the HTML injection.

GPS Location Services
TangleBot also uses GPS location data that enables actors to identify the location of the
device, which helps deliver relevant attack data based on geography, language, or
other criteria chosen by the threat actor. This information may also be used for more
nefarious purposes, including the tracking and identification of specific victims, and routine
purposes such as helping to identify systems used by researchers and analysts.

Voice Recording
We have identified several components used for voice recording using the microphone.
Audio is recorded at times determined by the threat actor and the collected content is
transmitted via RTSP to threat actor-controlled systems. RTSP, also known as Real Time
Streaming Protocol, offers advantages in compatibility and flexibility and allows data
transmissions via continuous streams rather than from a file on disk.
The purpose of voice recording is multifaceted and can introduce the risk of second order
effects or impacts. Threat actors can use stolen voice information to impersonate voice
biometric identification patterns in use by major financial organizations. These voice
biometrics help companies verify the identity of the caller but could be used by crafty
attackers to impersonate the victim or used to create Deepfake voice technology resulting in
additional schemes or financial loss.

Make a Call
Another capability uncovered within the TangleBot functionality is the ability to place a call
from the victim device. This capability could be used to dial premium services resulting
in financial loss or use the device to initiate a call impersonating the victim. Combine this with

voice biometric identification and it is not difficult to understand the potential danger this
functionality poses.

A New Evolution in Familiar Malware
TangleBot shares some similar behaviors with another piece of malware, Medusa, as
noted by other researchers, including recently by our peers at Cyble. Those researchers,
who have also looked into this same campaign, have produced a detailed write up containing
additional information not covered in this blog. That research attributes the malware to the
Medusa campaign from 2020.
We distinguish between that campaign and this one because of interesting malware
characteristics not previously seen in Medusa-related SMS campaigns. Characteristics
relating to keylogging functionality, overlay ability, and data exfiltration are routine behaviors
in any malware arsenal. TangleBot, however, sets itself apart with advanced behaviors and
transmission capabilities, while showcasing the latest evolutions in malware attempting to
thwart biometric voice-authentication security systems. One final component of TangleBot
not seen in the original Medusa is the advanced use of a string decryption routine helping to
obfuscate and conceal the behavior of the malware. All those factors combined are what led
Proofpoint researchers to the updated nomenclature.

TangleBot Name
Proofpoint researchers chose the name TangleBot to represent this malware due to the
many obfuscation layers used to hide the purpose and functionality of the software. The
malware uses various obfuscating techniques including hidden .dex files, modular
and functional design characteristics, minified code, and excessive unused code. Taken
together, this is a tangled mess of code that is both difficult and timely to dissect.

Outlook

19/20

If the Android ecosystem has shown us anything this summer, it is that the Android
landscape is rife with clever social engineering, outright fraud, and malicious software all
designed to deceive and steal mobile users’ money and other sensitive
information. These schemes can appear quite convincing and may play on fears or emotions
that cause users to let down their guard.
