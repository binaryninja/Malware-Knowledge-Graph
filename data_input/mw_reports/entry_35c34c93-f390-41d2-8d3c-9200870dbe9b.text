Key Points:
Emotet malicious email activity resumed Tuesday, March 7, 2023 at 8:00am EST.
Malicious emails contain attached .zip files that are not password protected.
The attached .zip files deliver Office documents with malicious macros, which in turn
download and execute the Emotet .dll.
It is unclear how long this round of email activity will last, as periods of activity in 2022
varied widely.
After several months of inactivity, the Emotet botnet resumed email activity this morning at
8:00am EST. The malicious emails seem to be replying to already existing email chains, with
the addition of an attached .zip file (Figure 1). The .zip files are not password protected. The
themes of the attached files include finances and invoices.

The .zip files attached to these recent Emotet emails contain an Office Document with
macros (Figure 2). Once opened, the user is prompted to “Enable Content”, which will allow
the malicious macros to run. The macros will download an Emotet .dll from an external site
and execute it locally on the machine.

It is unclear how long this round of email activity will last. While an earlier round of activity in
2022 extended across multiple weeks, the last round occurred over less than two weeks in
November 2022, with more than three months of inactivity on either side.
