U.S. Defense Contractors

Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented and stealthy
custom malware called SockDetour that targeted U.S.-based defense contractors with the goal of
being used as a secondary implant on compromised Windows hosts.
"SockDetour is a backdoor that is designed to remain stealthily on compromised Windows servers
so that it can serve as a backup backdoor in case the primary one fails," Palo Alto Networks' Unit
42 threat intelligence said in a report published Thursday. "It is difficult to detect, since it operates
filelessly and socketlessly on compromised Windows servers."
Even more concerningly, SockDetour is believed to have been used in attacks since at least July
2019, based on a compilation timestamp on the sample, implying that the backdoor successfully
managed to slip past detection for over two-and-a-half years.

The attacks have been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as TiltedTemple (aka DEV-0322 by
Microsoft), which is the designated moniker for a hacking group operating out of China and was
instrumental in exploiting zero-day flaws in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and
ServiceDesk Plus deployments as a launchpad for malware attacks last year.
The ties to TiltedTemple come from overlaps in the attack infrastructure, with one of the commandand-control (C2) servers that was used to facilitate the distribution of malware for the late 2021
campaigns also hosting the SockDetour backdoor, alongside a memory dumping utility and
numerous web shells for remote access.
Unit 42 said it unearthed evidence of at least four defense contractors targeted by the new wave of
attacks, resulting in the compromise of one of them.
The intrusions also predate the attacks that occurred through compromised Zoho ManageEngine
servers in August 2021 by a month. Analysis of the campaign has revealed that SockDetour was
delivered from an external FTP server to a U.S.-based defense contractor's internet-facing
Windows server on July 27, 2021.

"The FTP server that hosted SockDetour was a compromised Quality Network Appliance Provider
(QNAP) small office and home office (SOHO) network-attached storage (NAS) server," the
researchers pointed out. "The NAS server is known to have multiple vulnerabilities, including a
remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2021-28799."
What's more, the same server is said to have been already infected with the QLocker ransomware,
raising the possibility the TiltedTemple actor leveraged the aforementioned flaw to gain
unauthorized initial access.
SockDetour, for its part, is fashioned as a stand-in backdoor that hijacks legitimate processes'
network sockets to establish its own encrypted C2 channel, followed by loading an unidentified
plugin DLL file retrieved from the server.

"Thus, SockDetour requires neither opening a listening port from which to receive a connection nor
calling out to an external network to establish a remote C2 channel," the researchers said. "This
makes the backdoor more difficult to detect from both host and network level."
