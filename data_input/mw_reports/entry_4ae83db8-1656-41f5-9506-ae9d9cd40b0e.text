The DarkHotel threat group has been using some new methods in attacks aimed at
government employees with an interest in North Korea, according to a report
published this week by security firm Bitdefender.
The activities of the DarkHotel advanced persistent threat (APT) actor came to light in
November 2014, when Kaspersky published a report detailing a sophisticated cyber
espionage campaign targeting business travelers in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has
been around for nearly a decade and some researchers believe its members are Korean
speakers.
The attackers targeted their victims using several methods, including through their hotel’s WiFi, zero-day exploits and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing websites. Nearly one year later, the
threat group was observed using new attack techniques and an exploit leaked from Italian
spyware maker Hacking Team.
DarkHotel victims have been spotted in several countries, including North Korea, Russia,
South Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United States, India,
Mozambique, Indonesia and Germany. Up until recently, the attacks appeared to focus on
company executives, researchers and development personnel from sectors such as defense
industrial base, military, energy, government, NGOs, electronics manufacturing,
pharmaceutical, and medical.
In more recent DarkHotel attacks it has dubbed “Inexsmar,” security firm Bitdefender said the
hackers targeted political figures, and they appeared to be using some new methods.
Bitdefender’s analysis is based on samples from September 2016. The initial Trojan
downloader, delivered via phishing emails, collects information on the infected device and
sends it back to its command and control (C&C) server. If the compromised system meets
requirements (i.e. it belongs to an individual who is of interest), the first stage DarkHotel
downloader, disguised as a component of OpenSSL, is fetched.
In the meantime, in an effort to avoid raising suspicion, the malware opens a document titled
“Pyongyang e-mail lists - September 2016,” which provides a list of email contacts for
various organizations in North Korea’s capital city.

If the system profile does not match what the attackers are looking for, the C&C server
returns a “fail” string and the attack stops. If the attack continues, a second payload is
retrieved.
When Bitdefender analyzed the malware samples, the C&C server was offline, making it
impossible to know exactly who the victims were and how much damage was caused.
However, Bitdefender’s Bogdan Botezatu told SecurityWeek that, based on the structure of
the phishing message, the intended targets are most likely individuals working for
governments or state institutions who have an interest in the political situation in North
Korea.
Experts believe that the use of social engineering and a multi-stage downloader is an
improvement compared to the direct use of exploits as it gives the attackers more flexibility in
malware distribution and ensures that the Trojan remains up to date.
