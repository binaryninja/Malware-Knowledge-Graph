Credential harvesting
• A single employee
disclosing username and password
was enough to spread the attack​
• With access to our customer’s
user accounts, the attackers
sent several massive phishing
attacks from the
compromised accounts​ making it
harder for employees to recognize
the attack since it was coming
from a “real” email address​
• The attack then spread through our
environment

24

Spear-phishing
• Targeted phishing attempt carefully
designed to trick the regional VP
Finance to execute on a payment
from on behalf of customer “CEO”​
• Customer domain spoofed to look
very similar to customer email
address and use of real emails
• Invoice had accurate details and
email chain created a compelling
story
• Attack could have costed our
customer USD 292,000

© 2019 Proofpoint. All rights reserved

Payroll scam
• Attempt to get payroll at customer to
change “employee” direct deposit
account
• Email sent from “employee’s”
personal email to HR manager and,
indirectly, to payroll administrator
• Employee happened to be a general
manager
