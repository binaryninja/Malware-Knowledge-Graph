Episode 4: Crescendo
This is the final installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of
Sodinokibi and its connections to GandGrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service
(RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid 2019.
In this final episode of our series we will zoom in on the operations, techniques and tools
used by different affiliate groups spreading Sodinokibi ransomware.
Since May we have observed several different modus operandi by different affiliates, for
example:
Distributing the ransomware using spear-phishing and weaponized documents
Bat-files downloading payloads from Pastebin and inject them into a process on the
operating system
Compromising RDP and usage of script files and password cracking tools to distribute
over the victim’s network

Compromise of Managed Service Providers and usage of their distribution software to
spread the ransomware
To understand more about how this enemy operates, we in McAfee Advanced Threat
Research (ATR) decided to operate a global network of honeypots. We were aware of the
lively underground trade market of RDP credentials and were curious about what someone
would do with a compromised machine. Would they distribute the Sodinokibi ransomware?
Would they execute the DejaBlue or BlueKeep exploits? Our specially designed and built
RDP honeypots would give us those insights.

Like Moths to a Flame
From June until September 2019, we observed several groups compromise our honey pots
and conduct activities related to Sodinokibi; we were able to fully monitor attackers and their
actions without their knowledge.
It is important to note the golden rule we operated under: the moment criminal actions were
prepared or about to be executed, the actor would be disconnected and the machine would
be restored to its original settings with a new IP address.
We noticed some of our honeypot RDP servers were attacked by Persian-speaking actors
that were actively harvesting credentials. Our analysis of these attacks led us to various
Persian underground channels offering the same tools we observed appearing in Sodinokibi
intrusions. Some of these tools are closed source and custom made, originating from within
the channels in our analysis.
In this blog we will highlight a few of the intrusions we observed.

Group 1 – Unknown Affiliate ID
McAfee ATR observed initial activity against our South American honey pot begin in late May
2019. We had full visibility as the actor loaded a number of tools, including Sodinokibi, during
the initial intrusion period.
The following ransom note (uax291-readme.txt) was dropped onto the system on June 10th,
2019. The actor utilized Masscan and NLBrute to scan and target other assets over RDP
which fits with the behavior we have seen in all other Sodinokibi intrusions tracked by
McAfee ATR. The actor then created a user account ‘backup’ and proceeded to consistently
connect from an IP address range in Belgrade, Serbia.

Group 2 – Affiliate ID 34
Campaign 295 (based on sub-ID in the malware configuration)

2/9

The following Sodinokibi variant appeared in our South American honey pot with the original
file name of H.a.n.n.a.exe.
8d7d333574708c2fe5c37fad1bdfbc5a9664b33d (June 8th, 2019)
Extracting the configuration from the ransomware sample as we conducted during our
affiliate research, the affiliate-id is nr 34.
Upon initial intrusion, the actor created several user accounts on the target system between
June 10th and June 11th. The malware Sodinokibi and credential-harvesting tool Mimikatz
were executed under the user account “ibm” that the actor created as part of the entry into
the system
Further information revealed that the actor was connecting from two IP addresses in Poland
and Finland via the ‘ibm’ account. These logins originated from these countries in a 24hr
period between July 10th and 11th with the following two unique machine names WINS5N2M6EGS5J and TS11. Machine name WIN-S5N2M6EGS5J was observed to be used by
another actor that created the account “asp” and originated from the same Polish IP address.
The actor deployed a variant of the Mimikatz credential harvester during the intrusion, with
the following custom BAT file:

We have seen a consistent usage of various custom files used to interact with hacking tools
that are shared among the underground communities.
Another tool, known as Everything.exe, was also executed during the same period. This tool
was used to index the entire file system and what was on the target system. This tool is not
considered malicious and was developed by a legitimate company but can be used for
profiling purposes. The usage of reconnaissance tools to profile the machine is interesting as
it indicates potential manual lateral movement attempts by the actor on the target system.

July 20th to 30th Intrusion
Activity observed during this period utilized tools similar to those used in other intrusions we
have observed in multiple regions, including those by Affiliate ID 34.

3/9

In this activity McAfee ATR identified NLBrute being executed again to target victims over
RDP; a pattern we have seen over and over again in intrusions involving Sodinokibi. A
series of logins from Iran were observed between July 25th and July 30th, 2019.
We have also seen crypto currency mining apps deployed in most of the intrusions involving
Sodinokibi, which may suggest some interesting side activity for these groups. In this
incident we discovered a miner gate configuration file with a Gmail address.
Using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation techniques, we identified an individual
that is most likely tied to the discovered Gmail address. Based on our analysis, this individual
is likely part of some Persian-speaking credential cracking crew harvesting RDP credentials
and other types of data. The individual is sharing information related to Masscan and Kport
scan results for specific countries that can be used for brute force operations.

ACTOR PROFILE
Further, we observed this actor on a Telegram channel discussing operations which align to
the behavior we observed during intrusions on our honey pot. The data shared appears to be
results from tools such as Masscan or Kport-scan that would be used to compromise further
assets.

DISCUSSION OF SCANNING IN FARSI, ON PRIVATE CHANNEL
Other tools were found to have been executed the same day as the activity documented
include:
Mimikatz
Was executed manually from the command line with the following parameters:
mimikatz.exe “privilege::debug” “sekurlsa::logonPasswords full” “exit”
Slayer Leecher
MinerGate

Group 3 – Affiliate ID 19
We observed the following Sodinokibi ransom variants attributed to this affiliate appearing in
the honey pot in the Middle East. The attacker downloaded a file, ‫اﺑﺰار ﮐﺮک‬.zip, which can be
mostly found in Farsi language private channels. The tool is basically a VPS Checker (really
an RDP cracker) as discussed on the channels in the underground.
Campaign 36
Activity from June 3rd to 26th indicates that the attacker present on the system was
conducting operations involving the Sodinokibi ransomware. When linking back activity, we
observed one notable tool the actor had used during the operation.
‘Hidden-User.bat’ was designed to create hidden users on the target system. This tool links
back to some underground distribution on Farsi-speaking private channels.
The file being shared is identical to the one we found to be used actively in the Sodinokibi
case in different instances in June 2019, in different cities in the Middle East. We found the
following Farsi-speaking users sharing and discussing this tool specifically (Cryptor007 and
MR Amir), and others active in these groups. McAfee ATR observed this tool being used on
June 13th, 2019 and June 26th, 2019 by the same actors in different regions.

HIDDEN-USER.bat

POSTED IMAGE OF THE TOOL IN USE
These Sodinokibi variants are strictly appearing in Israel from our observations:
a3769a6748ba5d8023bcb161a5274e24d419bd36 (June 3rd, 2019)
bbabc23525b3852d463ef17ba7b8a2cab831e2b9 (June 11th, 2019)
We observed the actor dropping one of the above-mentioned variants of Sodinokibi. In this
case, the login came from an IP address originating in Iran and with a machine with a female
Persian name.
The attackers connecting are most likely Farsi-speaking, as is evident by the browsing
history uncovered by McAfee ATR, which indicates where a number of the tools utilized
originate from, including Farsi language file sharing sites, such as Picofile.com and Soft98.ir,
that contain malicious tools such as NLBrute, etc.

6/9

FARSI LANGUAGE SITE FOUND IN BROWSING HISTORY
We observed the actor attempting to run an RDP brute force attack using NLBrute
downloaded from the Iranian site Picofile.com. The target was several network blocks in
Oman and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East.
In our analysis we discovered an offer to install ransomware on servers posted in Farsi
speaking on August 19th,. This posting date corresponds with the timing of attacks observed
in the Middle East. The services mentioned are specifically targeting servers that have been
obtained via RDP credential theft campaigns. It is possible that these actors are coming in
after the fact and installing ransomware on behalf of the main organizer, according to actor
chatter. One specific Farsi language message indicates these services for a list of countries
where they could install ransomware for the potential client.

FARSI LANGUAGE MESSAGE FROM PERSIAN LANGUAGE CHANNEL

Conclusion
In our blog series about Sodinokibi we began by analyzing the code we asked ourselves the
question, “Why Persian?” With the information retrieved from our honeypot investigations, it
might give us a hypothesis that the Persian language is present due to the involvement of
Persian-speaking affiliates. Time and evidence will tell.
We observed many affiliates using different sets of tools and skills to gain profit and, across
the series, we highlighted different aspects of this massive ongoing operation.
To protect your organization against Sodinokibi, make sure your defense is layered. As
demonstrated, the actors we are facing either buy, brute-force or spear-phish themselves into
your company or use a trusted-third party that has access to your network. Some guidelines
for organizations to protect themselves include employing sandboxing, backing up data,
educating their users, and restricting access.
As long as we support the ransomware model, ransomware will exist as it has for the last
four years. We cannot fight alone against ransomware and have to unite as public and
private parties. McAfee is one of the founding partners of NoMoreRansom.org and are
supporting Law Enforcement agencies around the globe in fighting ransomware.
We hope you enjoyed reading this series of blogs about Sodinokibi.
