An APT Blueprint:
Gaining New Visibility into
Financial Threats
Bitdefender Forensic Investigation Reveals
Complete Attack Timeline and Behavior of
Notorious Financial Cyber Criminal Group

White Paper

Executive Summary
In mid-2018, Bitdefender researchers investigated a targeted attack on an Eastern European financial institution, gaining new
insights and creating a complete event timeline showing how the infamous group Carbanak infiltrates organizations, how it moves
laterally across the infrastructure, and the time it takes to set up the actual heist.
The initial point of compromise found in our investigation involved the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and
tainted documents rigged to download a Cobalt Strike beacon component. Within hours of compromise, the cybercriminal group
would begin to move laterally across the infrastructure, identify critical documents and prepare them for exfiltration, and try to
access the organization’s ATM and banking applications.
Bitdefender’s forensic analysis revealed some key compromise tactics:
•

Financial institutions in Eastern Europe remain the primary focus of the criminal group, which uses spear phishing as the
main attack vector

•

The presence of Cobalt Strike hacking tools is the key indicator that the financial institutions were targeted by the Carbanak
cyber-criminal gang

•

In the reconnaissance phase, data related to banking applications and internal procedures was collected and prepared for
exfiltration, to be used for the final stage of the attack

•

Infrastructure reconnaissance mainly occurred after business hours or on weekends to avoid triggering security alarms

•

It only took attackers a couple hours from initial compromise to fully established foothold and lateral movement, showing
experience, knowledge and coordination

•

The final goal of the targeted attack was to compromise the ATM networks, potentially to cash out at ATMs in a coordinated
physical and infrastructure criminal operation

Several spear-phishing campaigns attributed to Carbanak, all occurring between March and May 2018, were analyzed by security
researchers in 2018. These campaigns impersonated emails from high-profile organizations, such as IBM or European Central
Bank, but also cybersecurity companies.
While most forensic investigations focus on offering a highly technical analysis of the payloads used by the Carbanak group,
Bitdefender’s investigation offers a complete timeline of events, from the moment the email reached the victim’s inbox to the
moment of the heist.

A History of Criminal Activity
One of the most prolific APT-style cyberattacks, specifically targeting the financial sector, is known as Carbanak. Discovered in
2014, the campaign quickly gained notoriety after compromising the security systems of 100 banks in 40 countries and stealing
up to $1 billion in the process. Banks in countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Belarus,
Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Taiwan and Malaysia have allegedly been targeted with spearphishing emails, luring victims into clicking malicious URLs and executing booby-trapped documents.
The same group is believed to have also been using the Cobalt Strike framework to run sophisticated campaigns, plotting
and performing financial heists of financial institutions. Following an investigation led by law enforcement in cooperation with
cybersecurity companies, the leader of the group was apprehended in Alicante, Spain, on March 26th, 2018.
However, this action doesn’t appear to have made a dent in the cybercriminal organization, as subsequent spear-phishing campaigns
seem to have been reported from March until May 2018.

Spearphishing Campaigns Timeline
March 7th-10th Emails sent from fake domains: ibm-cert.com, ibm-warning.com, ibm- notice.com
March 15th

Emails impersonated VeriFon (a large POS terminal vendor) and used the fake dns-verifon.com domain.

March 26th

Phishing emails pertaining to be from SpamHaus (non-profit organization that fights spam and phishing). They
registered the spamhuas.com domain and cloned the content from the official website (spamhaus. org).

April 3rd

The group used compromised mail servers of a Swedish company.

May 18th

Impersonated the SWIFT payment system and embedded documents with a JavaScript backdoor. A similar
attack was used on USA and Europe banks.

May 23rd

Spearphishing emails claiming to be from a security vendor.

May 28th

Spearphishing emails impersonating the European Central Bank. They contained a JavaScript backdoor.

A Carbanak trademark in cyberattacks remains the use of Cobalt Strike – a powerful pentesting tool designed for exploiting and
executing malicious code, simulating post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors – which allows them to infiltrate the
organization, move laterally, exfiltrate data, and deploy anti-forensic and evasion tools. While the end results of such an attack can
be easily assessed in financial losses, little information has been publicly available until now on how the attack occurs step-by-step
within a compromised organization.

White Paper

Modus Operandi
The APT-style cybercriminal group has a long track record of successfully targeting financial institutions around the world to either
cash out at ATMs or perform wire transfers using the bank’s internal systems.
The spear-phishing emails sent to the financial institutions either end up with victims downloading a tampered document meant to
download the Cobalt Strike beacon or to exploit several unpatched Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities and deploy a backdoor.
Once the user attempts to open the attached documents, scripts (Fig. 1) embedded within the files are dropped on the disk and
automatically executed in the background. This is a popular technique, sometimes associated with advanced persistent threats
(APTs) attributed to nation-sponsored threat actors.

Fig. 1 - Windows Script Component (.sct) file sample, embedded in spearphishing attachment (md5: bb784d55895db10b67b1b4f1f5b0be16)

Designed for stealth infiltration within the targeted system, the attacks use reconnaissance tools designed to assess the state of
the victim’s workstation and determine what tools should be downloaded next, or even open decoy documents similar to the one in
Fig.2, to avoid drawing victims’ suspicion.

Bitdefender’s Investigation, Resulting in a
Complete Attack Timeline
Bitdefender’s forensics and investigation team was contacted to look into a security incident that started in May 2018 with an email
received by two of the bank’s employees. As previously mentioned, the date coincides with a Carbanak spear-phishing campaign.
The attack target was to gain access to banking systems and eventually withdraw funds in cash from ATMs. The pattern exhibited
by attackers and their lateral movements across the infrastructure show that they knew what types of information to look for and
they were skilled at evasion techniques.
Judging by the way the adversaries interacted with different systems, the targeted hosts and the documents prepared for
exfiltration, it appears that the cybercriminal group focused initially on mapping the internal processes and applications of the
affected institution. They displayed a deep understanding of the nature and location of the data they sought. They were able to
maintain a low network footprint and avoid suspicion by using selected single workstations as a hub for centralizing collected
information and for communication with their command & control server, outside the regular working hours of the bank.
After compromising the first victim, the aggressors’ next goal was to find admin-level credentials that would allow them to move
across the entire infrastructure. By performing all these operations outside business hours and limiting their interaction to only a
handful of systems, the cybercriminal group minimized the detection opportunities.

[4]

White Paper

A carefully executed network reconnaissance and lateral movement plan was unfolding during this time. What follows is a timeline
of events that started with the initial spear-phising email.

Initial compromise
Two victims were tricked into opening the spear-phishing attachment, initially compromising two separate endpoints.
Day 0 (day of initial compromise)
16:48 – one of the employees opened the document within the spear-phishing email
16:49 – a second employee opened the same tainted document. The document opened by both employees used three
exploit methods for Remote Code Execution in Microsoft Word: CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-11882, and CVE-2018-0802. To
distract the user from the attack occurring in the background, a decoy document (fig 2) was used. Finally, a backdoor from the
Command and Control Server was used to establish persistence in the infrastructure.

(md5: c2a9443aac258a60d8cace43e839cf9f)

At this point, the adversary had the ability to download and execute new payloads, download additional scripts, run shell commands
to move laterally in the infrastructure, and delete files from the system and cleaning registry keys to leave fewer forensics traces.

[5]

White Paper

Network lateral movement & data collection
In this phase, attackers compromised additional network endpoints, gathering data and using one of the endpoints for collecting
and storing internal documents that appeared of interest.
Day 0 (continued) 17:05 to 18:20
As soon as the first spear-phishing email was accessed, events occurred as follows:
-

Three Microsoft Word exploits (mentioned above) were used;

-

Cobalt Strike beacon was delivered and used to discover and map the organization’s internal network, with the purpose of
collecting administrative level credentials;

-

Credentials for one Domain Administrator were compromised and used throughout the duration of the attack;

-

Credentials were “tested” on one of the Domain Controller servers to make sure they’re valid, resulting in its compromise

At least two more endpoints were compromised by the end of the day.
Days 1 to 28
Numerous workstations were systemically compromised in a search for critical information that the cybercriminals could use.
Day 10
Attack reaches another compromised, which will later be used to store documents related to internal applications, manuals and
other potentially valuable documents.
Day 28
A series of potentially valuable documents pertaining to internal applications and procedures were identified and prepared for
exfiltration.

Internal Servers Compromised
Lateral movements and intelligence collection continue, while attackers also target and compromise additional internal hosts and
servers that will be used during the actual heist.
Between Day 30 to 46, over a period of 17 days, a series of archives were created containing manuals, guides and training materials
for different applications. The information gathered was archived and organized in different folders. This information was relevant
in planning the attack on the bank and, potentially, other banks that share similar systems. The cybercriminal group could be
actively improving its understanding of internal banking systems by collecting and studying this type of information, in an attempt
to make their attacks more efficient and stealthier. Their specialization in compromising banking infrastructures could be a direct
consequence of intelligence collected and assimilated after each attack on previous financial institutions. This level of intimate
knowledge of how banking applications work based on stolen documentation, helps them quickly achieve their purpose, which is
to access and transfer financial assets. The more information they have on the inner workings of banking applications, the easier it
becomes to pull off surgical cyber heists and avoid security tripwires.

[6]

Day 30

A series of archives were created containing manuals, guides and training materials for different applications.
The information gathered was archived and organized in different folders.

Day 33

Attackers connected to servers and hosts with access to banking applications. The connections were initiated
from workstations that had activity after regular office hours.

Day 33 to 46

A series of archives were created containing manuals, guides and training materials for different applications.
The information gathered was archived and organized in different folders.

White Paper

Day 46 to 63

Using a compromised domain administrator account, attackers remotely dial into various network workstations
and ultimately remove the archives used to store the baking materials, to cover their tracks

Starting on Day 33, attackers connected to servers and hosts with access to banking applications. The connections were initiated
from workstations that had activity after regular office hours.
The workstations used to connect to these machines were logged in from and controlled by a workstation that was not part of the
legitimate corporate infrastructure. The system belonged to the adversary and accessed the organization network through a VPN
tunnel established by the Cobalt Strike beacon component, to contact the internal corporate network systems.
These command & control connections last between 20 minutes and one hour on average, based on the logs available for forensic
investigation. The documents prepared for exfiltration, which were relevant to the internal applications, as well as the connections
to banking applications after regular office hours, point to a financially motivated attack.
Below is a complete lateral movement timeline that includes all major events related to what infrastructure assets were compromised
and when. Marked in red are the three major milestones achieved during the attack: the moment the domain controller was
compromised, the moment documents started being stored on an internal endpoint, and when the threat actors first connected to
a host with access to banking applications .
This lateral movement timeline was compiled based on forensic evidence correlated from several analyzed systems and network
events. It is the most relevant blueprint, revealing a complete attack timeline and behavior of the notorious financial cyber-criminal
group when inside an infrastructure belonging to a financial organization.

Technical Analysis - experts only
Below is a detailed analysis of the key indicators of compromise that helped build the APT timeline. It includes an event timeline
compiled from two workstations used in the attack: the one used to compromise the domain controller and the one used to store
all the network-collected data.
The following events help paint a clear picture of actions immediately after the spear-phishing email attachment was opened, and
show how the threat actors move laterally across the infrastructure and how they gathered relevant documentation.
The “swift-fraud[.]com/documents/94563784.doc” URL was opened from the body of an email received in a
spearphishing campaign targeting financial institutions. The Bitdefender research team obtained the document from our Threat
Intelligence feeds and started analyzing it. According to other threat reports, the same URL has been used in delivering other tainted
documents, potentially part of similar campaigns aimed at other financial institutions. This suggests the cybercriminal group may
have been delivering multiple documents to victims, potentially laced with other exploits or droppers.
The attack flow leaves behind a temporary file, which was found on two of the systems analyzed in the incident response. This
temporary file was created on the filesystem after the opening of the original document file, downloaded from the malicious URL
mentioned above.
Analysis of the document on one of the systems reveals the steps involved in compromising the targeted system via the spear
phishing email. The document contains four objects that are dropped on the filesystem of the victim:

Attack flow after opening the tampered spearphishing document
KbhpQIcahFCuZwq.sct - (bb784d55895db10b67b1b4f1f5b0be16)
This object was not found on disk, it was deleted after running by “MGsCOxPSNK.txt”. Its role is to launch into
execution the component “MGsCOxPSNK.txt”
MGsCOxPSNK.txt (4bee6ff39103ffe31118260f9b1c4884)
This file was not found on disk. Its functionality is to act as a next stage batch script which executes “cmstp.

This file can be found at the path: C:\Users\[redacted]\AppData\Local\Temp\cqHfjCkTtMwG.doc. It is a decoy
file, because it acts as a normal document file while the malicious payload is being dropped and executed on
the system.

[8]

tCrrDqBQoCcEkbnK.txt (581c2a76b382deedb48d1df077e5bdf1)
This object can be found at the path: C:\Users\[redacted]\AppData\Local\Temp\tCrrDqBQoCcEkbnK.txt. It is a
configuration file for cmstp.exe. It downloads a DLL dropper from “cloud[.]yourdocument[.]biz/robots.txt”

White Paper

The DLL Dropper downloaded on step four was not found on the file system and has the role of decrypting and dropping yet another
JavaScript Dropper on the system. The decrypted JavaScript will be saved at the path “%APPDATA%\<registry_value>.txt” where
registry_value = “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Notepad[USERNAME]\303F1428C3F”. Before exiting, the DLL will
self-delete.
The file “303F1428C3F.txt” (eb561d46c6283c632df88bd20ade6df4) can be found at the path C:\Users\[redacted]\
AppData\Roaming\303F1428C3F.txt. Also, the file was obfuscated and encrypted with RC4. After decryption, the binary tried
to download a JavaScript backdoor from the Command and Control server (C&C) “nl[.][redacted][.]kz/robots.txt” and
saved the file to “%APPDATA%\9D01CA.txt”. The backdoor “%APPDATA%\9D01CA.txt” was then executed via “regsrv32”
(ex. “regsvr32 /S /N /U /I:path_backdoor scrobj”).
The file “9D01CA.txt” sent an initial fingerprint of the system compromised which contained the name of the antivirus solution
installed on the system, the local IP address, username, computername and OS version. After this communication, the component
waited for instructions from the C&C “nl[.][redacted][.]kz/api/v1”.
The traffic with the C&C was encrypted and the commands received from the C&C would split into five types:
●

“d&exec”: download and execute payload (EXE of DLL)

●

“more_eggs”: download additional scripts (including self-update) and save them in “%APPDATA%”

●

“gtfo”: self delete/registry cleanup

●

“more_onion”: runs additional downloaded scripts

●

“via_x”: execute command shell commands

All files mentioned in this stage of the attack were created on the system on Day 0 at around 16:49, when the first download link was
accessed. It is worth mentioning that a binary executable named “rad353F7.tmp”, which appeared on the system at a later date,
Day 6, was most certainly downloaded on the system by the Javascript Backdoor “9D01CA.txt”.
Day 0 at 16:48:58 marks the touchdown of a decoy file on two systems. This file is a decoy because it acts as a normal document
file while the malicious payload is being dropped on the system. On one of the two workstations, the decoy file has the creation time
of Day 0 at 16:49:09 (10 seconds later than the other workstation) and the path C:\Users\[redacted]\AppData\Local\
Temp\cqHfjCkTtMwG.doc. This system shows more stages of the attack, because the adversary used this machine to perform
lateral movement and compromise a domain administrator account within two hours of the initial compromise.
After the compromise of the domain administrator account, a network discovery is performed and systems start to be logged on via
remote desktop protocol to reach the objective of infiltrating the network and gathering information.
Below is a complete timeline of events recorded on the workstation that was used to compromise the domain administrator account
employed by attackers throughout the lateral movement process.

The workstation used to store the .zip archives containing internal banking documents was compromised on Day 9 using domain
admin credentials. On that day, attackers remotely dialed into the workstation and started accessing various network locations in an
attempt to find various internal banking application files and documents.
From Day 10 to Day 27, the same workstation was used to connect to other internal network server.
On Day 28 at 10:43:57 and 19:53:49, two .zip archive containing internal documents were created.
On Day 30 at 10:53:50, a third .zip archive was created, and it was deleted at 15:34:38.
On Day 46, attackers deleted a series of documents and folders from the workstation, potentially to cover their tracks and leave no
evidence regarding the collected documents.

Cobalt Strike Beacon Capabilities
The Cobalt Strike beacon is a malicious agent implant that, once dropped on a compromised system, calls back to the attacker and
checks for new commands to be executed on the compromised system. This versatile tool can support two types of communication
mechanisms: asynchronous and interactive. The asynchronous mode keeps commands in a queue and, when the beacon connects
to a C&C, it downloads commands, executes them, and finally reports results to the C&C server. This can be particularly useful when
trying to keep a low network footprint and not trigger any alarms by constantly “chatting” back and forth with the C&C server.
While the asynchronous communication mode is also known as “low and slow”, in the sense that it becomes inactive when
an internet connection is not present, the interactive communication mode offers real-time interaction with the compromised
workstation.
Overall framework capabilities include, but are not limited to, executing shell commands, uploading and downloading files, recording
keystrokes and taking screenshots, escalating privileges, deploying exploits, bypassing User Account Control (UAC), and even
deploying memory scraping tools, such as Mimikatz, or enumerating Active Directory (AD) hosts.
By supporting malleable communication with the C&C server, it can help attackers blend malicious traffic as legitimate, by allowing
them to transform and store data, interpret it backwards, and extract and recover that data from a transaction.

Conclusions
The Carbanak group, which has a long track record of compromising infrastructure belonging to financial institutions, is still
active. Its purpose remains to manipulate financial assets, such as transferring funds from bank accounts or taking over ATM
infrastructures and instructing them to dispense cash at predetermined time intervals.
Bitdefender’s investigation shows the attackers’ main methods remain to quietly infiltrate the infrastructure by establishing a
foothold on an employee’s system, then move laterally across the infrastructure or elevate privileges to find critical systems that
manage financial transactions or ATM networks.
This attack falls in line with previous objectives observed in past attacks on other financial institutions, as the cybercriminal
organization targeted the ATM network to reach systems belonging to key people within the organization who have access to ATM
systems.
If the attack had succeeded, it would have given hackers control over the ATM network, while money mules would have been
standing by the ATM machines at pre-set time intervals to cash them out. They could have also been able to reset the cash-out limit
on ATMs, using a predetermined / preauthorized card. This way, money mules could have extracted the same amount over and over,
without the ATMs reporting any transactions to the bank.
It is not uncommon in a targeted attack for phishing emails to bypass anti-spam solutions deployed at the mail server level, which
is why it is good practice to deploy an in-depth security model that ensures URL filtering, behavior-based detection techniques and
sandboxing, aside from classical anti-malware solutions. An enterprise-level solution that looks at both network traffic and endpoint
behavior would observe lateral movements by the attacker and flag them for review by a security analyst.
The damage observed throughout the investigation process was limited to access of internal documents on the compromised
systems and user account credentials leaked.
