Agents

2/3

The Merlin Agent is kept in its own repository so that it can easily be retrieved and compiled:
go get github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin-agent

The Windows DLL Agent is also kept in a separate repository. See the DLL Agent
documentation for building instructions.

Mythic
The Merlin server is a self-contained command line program that requires no installation. You
just simply download it and run it. The command-line interface only works great if it will be
used by a single operator at a time. The Merlin agent can be controlled through Mythic,
which features a web-based user interface that enables multiplayer support, and a slew of
other features inherent to the project.
Visit the Merlin repository in the MythicAgents organizaiton to get started.
