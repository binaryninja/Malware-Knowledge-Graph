Researchers discovered a new Snatch ransomware strain that will reboot computers it
infects into Safe Mode to disable any resident security solutions and immediately starts
encrypting files once the system loads.
Encrypting the victim's files is possible because most security tools are automatically
disabled when Windows devices boot in Safe Mode as the Sophos Managed Threat
Response (MTR) team and SophosLabs researchers found.
"Snatch can run on most common versions of Windows, from 7 through 10, in 32- and 64bit versions," they add. "The samples weâ€™ve seen are also packed with the open-source
packer UPX to obfuscate their contents."
Snatch ransomware came out towards the end of 2018 and it became noticeably active
during April 2019 as shown by a spike in ransom notes and encrypted file samples
submitted to Michael Gillespie's ID Ransomware platform.

Persistence, stealing data, and payload delivery
A suspected member of the Snatch ransomware team was observed by Sophos'
researchers while "looking for affiliate partners with access to
RDP\VNC\TeamViewer\WebShell\SQL inj [SQL injection] in corporate networks, stores, and
other companies."
This hints at the group or its affiliates abusing this type of security holes into organizations'
computing systems, as shown by logs the researchers discovered on one the victims'
encrypted servers pointing at the threat actors brute-forcing a server's Microsoft Azure
admin account and logging in via Remote Desktop (RDP).
"Subsequent hunts for related files revealed several other attacks in which precisely the
same collection of tools was used in what appear to be opportunistic attacks against
organizations located around the world, including the United States, Canada, and several
European countries," Sophos says.
"All the organizations where these same files were found also were later discovered to have
one or more computers with RDP exposed to the internet."
After the initial intrusion, the attackers logged into the domain controller (DC) machine using
the same admin account and maintained access, collecting and exfiltrating information, as
well as monitoring the victim's network for a few weeks.

They also installed surveillance software on around 5% of all machines on the network
(roughly 200 computers), which also allowed for remote access making it possible to
maintain persistence on the compromised network even if the compromised Azure server

would've been taken down.
"The threat actors have also innovated their crime in another important way: one piece of
malware used in the Snatch attacks is capable of, and has been, stealing vast amounts of
information from the target organizations," Sophos adds.
The group behind it has also been observed while dropping a series of other tools including
Process Hacker, IObit Uninstaller, PowerTool, and PsExec that would also help them
disable security tools on devices they compromise.
Dropping the Snatch ransomware component payload on the compromised network
happens following a seemingly random timeline, in some cases taking just a few days while
in others it can take weeks.

Disabling anti-malware solutions and encrypting devices
To take advantage of anti-malware solutions not loading in Safe Mode, the Snatch
ransomware component installs itself as a Windows service dubbed SuperBackupMan
capable of running in Safe Mode that can't be stopped or paused, and then force restarts
the compromised machine.
After the device enters Windows Safe Mode, Snatch ransomware will delete "all the Volume
Shadow Copies on the system" as the researchers discovered, preventing "forensic
recovery of the files encrypted by the ransomware."
In the next stage, the malware will start encrypting its victims' files, with the attackers now
being sure that recovery without payment is impossible.

The researchers made a video demo showing one of the Snatch ransomware samples
rebooting an infected system and encrypting files once the Windows Safe Mode is loaded.
Coveware, a company specialized in intermediating ransomware negotiations, told Sophos
that they negotiated with the Snatch team "on 12 occasions between July and October on
behalf of their clients" with the ransom demands ranging between $2,000 to $35,000 worth
of bitcoins, going up over those four months.
To avoid getting breached and infected with Snatch ransomware, companies are advised by
Sophos not to expose RDP services to the Internet or protect them by using a VPN.
Since the group behind this ransomware is also actively looking for affiliates with access to
exposed VNC and TeamViewer endpoints, as well as with experience in SQL server
hacking and deploying/using web shells, exposing this type of services could also expose
potential victims to attacks.
Last but least, Sophos recommends organizations to use multifactor authentication (MFA)
for protecting administrator accounts to prevent brute force attacks.
An extensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) including malware sample hashes,
exfiltration server addresses, commands used in the attacks, and more, are available here.
