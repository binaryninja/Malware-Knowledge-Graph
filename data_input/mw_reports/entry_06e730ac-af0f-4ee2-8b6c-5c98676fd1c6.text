The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to
China
IN THREAT RESEARCH BY THREATCONNECT RESEARCH TEAM

UPDATE: Premera Latest Healthcare Insurance Agency to be Breached
When news of the Anthem breach was reported on February 4th, 2015, the security
industry quite understandably went wild. A breach of this magnitude was certainly
unprecedented. Naturally, many industry professionals were keenly interested in
digging into this incident to see what could be uncovered, and the research team at
ThreatConnect was no exception. Thanks to our powerful API and third-party
partner integrations, we were able to use ThreatConnect to quickly uncover a
wealth of intelligence even when initially hindered by a relative lack of investigative
lead information and context, a key requirement of any Threat Intelligence
Platform (TIP). However, before we delve into what we were able to uncover, let’s
brieﬂy review the facts as they stood in the wake of the initial discovery
announcement.

What We Know:

On the morning of
February 4th, 2015,
several major news outlets
broke the story that
Anthem, Inc.’s network
defenses had been
breached. According to

breached. According to
a statement from Anthem’s
CEO, the company fell
victim to a “very
sophisticated external
cyber attack,” and the
hackers “obtained” the
personally identiﬁable
information (PII) of
approximately 80M
customers. This included
social security numbers,
birthdays, street
addresses, phone numbers
and income data – plenty
of information to enable
identity theft. This was a signiﬁcant event for several reasons:
Anthem, formerly known as Wellpoint, is the largest managed healthcare
company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and by extension, one of the
largest healthcare organizations in the United States. As such, any compromise,
no matter how insigniﬁcant, would likely impact countless individuals.
Blue Cross Blue Shield provides healthcare coverage for about half the U.S.
federal workforce. This means that their information was potentially compromised
too.
Unlike the Sony hack which was destructive in nature and meant to send a
message for coercive purposes, the Anthem compromise was purportedly very
covert, a fact which may suggest something about the adversary’s motives.
As of late February 2015, there have not been any indications that the exﬁltrated
PII data was immediately commoditized on the black market for the purpose of
enabling identity theft, as was the case in the Home Depot Breach.

Filling the Gaps:
Obviously, these high-level observations do not provide cybersecurity researchers a
great deal of information to work with. However, when presented within the context
of a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), an incomplete trail of evidence can highlight

intelligence gaps, a study of which can orient threat researchers towards their
analytic objectives. To this end, let’s examine what we wanted to discover in the
context of the Anthem breach:
Who was responsible for the attack?
What was the objective of the attack? Was it cyber theft, an espionage operation,
or something different?
Who was targeted in the attack? The answer to this question, obscured as it may
be, would likely shed some light on the objective of the breach.
What was the timeline of the activity?
The real power of a Threat Intelligence Platform is demonstrated when you are able
to collect and maintain a robust dataset of threat indicators, both past and present,
which can help orient you in the right direction in the wake of a newly discovered
breach. Even when you do not have a good deal of information to start with (for
example a ﬁle hash, or an IP address), you may ﬁnd leads by pivoting through
archived datasets until you uncover key pieces of the puzzle. In the case of the
Anthem breach, we were able to do just that.

Anthem Themed Infrastructure & Signed
Malware:
In September 2014, the ThreatConnect Research Team observed a variant of the
Derusbi APT malware family, MD5: 0A9545F9FC7A6D8596CF07A59F400FD3,
which was signed by a valid digital signature from the Korean company
DTOPTOOLZ Co. Derusbi is a family of malware used by multiple actor groups but
associated exclusively with Chinese APT. ThreatConnect Research began tracking
the DTOPTOOLZ signature for additional signed malware samples and
memorialized them within our Threat Intelligence Platform over time.
Analyst Comment: The DTOPTOOLZ signature has also been observed in
association with Korean Adware that is afﬁliated with the actual DTOPTOOLZ Co.
This adware should not be confused with the APT malware that is abusing the same
digital signature.
Later, in mid-November we discovered another implant that was digitally signed
with the DTOPTOOLZ signature. This implant, MD5:
98721c78dfbf8a45d152a888c804427c, was from the “Sakula” (aka. Sakurel) family

of malware, a known variant of the Derusbi backdoor, and was conﬁgured to
communicate with the malicious command and control (C2) domains
extcitrix.we11point[.]com and www.we11point[.]com. Through our Farsight
Security passive DNS integration, we uncovered that this malicious infrastructure
was likely named in such a way to impersonate the legitimate Wellpoint IT
infrastructure.
Passive DNS and historic DomainTools Whois data also provided insights that
helped establish an initial timeline dating back to April 2014, when the faux domains
came into existence and were later operationalized by the attackers. A Threat
Intelligence Platform should allow for analysts to easily put together and organize
such insights, collaborate around relevant analysis internally, and share the ﬁnished
analysis with external industry groups and organizations. In the hopes that our
community members could beneﬁt from or provide further insight into this suspicious
incident, we immediately shared our threat intelligence including indicators,
signatures and analytical context to the ThreatConnect Medical and Health
Community on November 13, 2014. This included sending out a notiﬁcation to all
stakeholders as well as our followers on Twitter.
When the Anthem breach later came to light in early February, we re-shared the
signatures, indicators and context freely to the entire ThreatConnect user base. As
we dug further, we expanded our understanding of the malicious we11point[.]com
infrastructure, taking particular interest to the subdomains such as
“extcitrix.we11point[.]com and “hrsolutions.we11point[.]com”. Note the “citrix” and
“hr” (human resources) preﬁxes that the adversary used to mirror legitimate remote
infrastructure and employee beneﬁts resources in the May 2014 timeframe. This
provided initial insights as to the likely targeting themes and or vectors in which the
adversary may have used when initiating their targeting campaign.

The fact that the malicious infrastructure closely mirrored other legitimate Wellpoint
infrastructure supported our hypothesis that the Derusbi / Sakula malware was

conﬁgured to operate and persist within a speciﬁc target enterprise.

Possible Premera Blue Cross Infrastructure:
Retrospective analysis of other targeted malware samples using the DTOPTOOLZ
Co. digital signature led to the identiﬁcation of an “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump”
implant MD5: 02FAB24461956458D70AEED1A028EB9C (OpenOfﬁcePlugin.exe),
which was ﬁrst observed on December 11, 2013. Although this malware sample is
not Derusbi / Sakula, it too is strongly believed to be associated with Chinese APT
activity and in fact may have also been involved in a Blue Cross Blue Shield
targeting campaign as early as December 2013.

This particular binary is conﬁgured to connect to the static IP address
142.91.76[.]134. Passive DNS of this IP indicates that on December 11th, 2013, the
same date as the malware sample was observed, the domain prennera[.]com also
resolved to 142.91.76[.]134. It is believed that the prennera[.]com domain may have
been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the
attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the “m” with
two “n” characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would be seen

two “n” characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would be seen
ﬁve months later with the we11point[.]com command and control infrastructure.

Section Summary:
The Derusbi / Sakula malware implant types are unique in that they have
traditionally been seen within Chinese APT espionage campaigns.
The “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” malware implant (while a different family of
malware than Derusbi / Sakula) is also believed to be of Chinese origin, and was
also digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ digitalsignature. This implant
connected to a C2 node that overlapped with prennera[.]com.
We believe that the prennera[.]com domain may be impersonating Premera Blue
Cross (premera.com), using a similar character replacement technique seen in
the we11point[.]com campaign.

VAE Inc. Themed Infrastructure & Signed
Malware
Another powerful attribute of ThreatConnect is the ability for analysts to logically
group items such as atomic indicators, related documents or signatures, all of which
may include individualized custom context enrichments and associations. Over time,
the ability to memorialize groupings of related or like activity allows analysts to
quickly uncover non-obvious relationships within their private datasets. This is
exactly what happened as we continued to investigate these incidents.
As industry analysts and media speculated Chinese APT involvement in the Anthem
breach, our focus into the Derusbi / Sakula malware signed with the DTOPTOOLZ
Co. digital signature shifted from the we11point[.]com incident to another cluster of
activity that occurred later in May 2014. We immediately reviewed Incident
20140526B: vaeit APT, an incident that we initially shared to our Subscriber
Community on September 29, 2014 after conducting retrospective analysis.

Just as was the case with the we11point[.]com and prennera[.]com incidents, the
VAE, Inc. incident is also believed to be associated with Chinese APT espionage
activity. In this case the adversary also used Derusbi / Sakula malware that was
signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature and conﬁgured to communicate
with faux infrastructure appearing to be masquerading as internal resources for the
Department of Defense Contractor VAE, Inc. Additionally, in response to an inquiry
from KrebsOnSecurity, VAE, Inc. would later conﬁrm that it had indeed been a target
of a failed spearphishing attempt in May 2014 which used the malicious faux VAE,
Inc. themed domain.
The targeted incident relied upon the Sakula executable MD5:
230D8A7A60A07DF28A291B13DDF3351F which had a XOR 0x9A encoded C2
callbacks to the IP address 192.199.254[.]126 (registered to Wehostwebsites[.]com
– “Tom Yu” of Baoan, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China) as well as a
hardcoded callback to sharepoint-vaeit[.]com. Passive DNS of the static C2 IP
192.199.254[.]126 revealed a single suspicious domain of interest –
topsec2014[.]com. This domain had historic resolution around May 8, 2014 within a
month of the ﬁrst observed Sakula activity using the IP 192.199.254[.]126 as C2.

Using historic Whois, we discovered that topsec2014[.]com was initially registered
by li2384826402@yahoo[.]com on May 6th, 2014. Although the
li2384826402@yahoo[.]com registrant is likely a reseller given that it has been
observed registering several thousands of other domains, the fact that it was used
to register both the faux VAE, Inc. C2 infrastructure and the overlapping domain

to register both the faux VAE, Inc. C2 infrastructure and the overlapping domain
topsec2014[.]com within the same month suggests that there may be a relationship
between the client of the reseller for the VAE, Inc. infrastructure and the client for
topsec2014[.]com.

Just four minutes after the initial registration of topsec2014[.]com, the Whois
records were updated from the initial registrant, Li Ning –
li2384826402@yahoo[.]com to TopSec China – TopSec_2014@163[.]com. This
domain record has been unchanged since May 7th 2014. The we11point[.]com
infrastructure and by extension the faux VAE Inc. infrastructure is associated with
Cluster 2 of the ScanBox framework by PwC. The latest PwC update to ScanBox
states that there are “links between the domain allegedly used in the Anthem hack
(we11point.com) to Cluster 2 through shared WHOIS details.”

OPM Themed Infrastructure
One notable pattern was how the domain Whois registration information for the
VAE, Inc. themed infrastructure was quickly updated and obfuscated with
pseudorandom 10 character gmx.com email addresses and using the names of
various comic book characters from the Iron Man franchise. This comic-themed
naming convention has been previously documented by our friends at Crowdstrike
in what they characterize as being associated with a Chinese APT group they have
dubbed “Deep Panda”.
Leveraging our DomainTools partnership, we were able to correlate the outlier
domain opm-learning[.]org. This domain was also purportedly registered by the Iron
Man movie hero “Tony Stark” on July 28, 2014. This infrastructure naming

convention suggests a possible Ofﬁce of Personnel Management (OPM) theme.
However, in this case we lacked any speciﬁc sample of malware to verify our initial
suspicions that this infrastructure was operational. The possible OPM reference in
the domain name is noteworthy considering it was revealed in July of 2014 that
OPM had been compromised by a likely state-sponsored Chinese actor in midMarch of that year. The fact this domain was registered after the breach occurred
suggests that OPM could be an ongoing direct target of Chinese state-sponsored
cyber espionage activity.
Our attention then turned to the FBI Flash Report A-000049-MW that was publicly
reported by Brian Krebs on February 6th, 2015. This FBI Flash Report was issued
on January 27th, 2015, the same day an Anthem administrator detected suspicious
activity according to an internal memo. This memo goes on to indicate that the FBI
would not be party to the Anthem breach until they were notiﬁed on January 29th,
2015; based on these facts we assess with high conﬁdence that it is very unlikely
that the FBI Flash Report was directly related to the Anthem breach. Rather, we
suspect that the FBI ﬂash report likely references the USIS breach that was
announced on August 6, 2014, or the previous OPM breach, considering the
statement that the breach involved “compromised and stolen sensitive business
information and Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) from US commercial and
government networks through cyber espionage.”
The malware referenced within the FBI Report is associated with a Derusbi
backdoor subvariant named “InfoAdmin” / “Kakfum” where the FBI speciﬁcally
references open source reporting of “Deep Panda” as being related to the malware
observed in the attack. The malicious infrastructure highlighted in the report are the
domains images.googlewebcache[.]com and smtp.outlookssl[.]com. Both of these
top level domains were included with other related domains, all of which were
shared on September 16th, 2013 to the ThreatConnect Subscriber Community in
Incident 20130823C: Some.Trouble APT Domains, roughly a year and half prior to
the FBI Flash report.
It is important to mention that both the domains images.googlewebcache[.]com and
smtp.outlookssl[.]comas were also previously identiﬁed in an October 2014 PwC
blog post as seen within Cluster 1 of the Scanbox framework, while the Sakula
activity with we11point and VAEIT is contained within Cluster 2 of that report. This
implies that the actor referenced within the FBI Flash report uses shared capabilities
(in this case the ScanBox kit) with the Sakula / we11point actor.

Section Summary:

Section Summary:
The Derusbi / Sakula malware seen in both the we11point[.]com and VAE Inc.
campaigns were structurally the same and digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ
signature.
The emerging theme is that this particular signature and family of malware is
highly indicative of a particular Chinese APT activity.
Within this web of malicious infrastructure, there is an interesting overlap with the
topsec2014[.]com domain and attack infrastructure.
ThreatConnect Research identiﬁed a domain opm-learning[.]org that had a similar
superhero themed WHOIS registrant to the Sakula / VAE Inc. infrastructure. The
possible OPM reference is noteworthy considering the Ofﬁce of Personnel
Management (OPM) was compromised in March 2014. Additionally, an FBI Flash
Report 0000-49MW referenced indicators that were possibly associated with the
USIS hack and a Derusbi variant called “Kakfum” / “InfoAdmin”. Both the FBI
Flash infrastructure and the Sakula / VAE Inc. infrastructure are tied to the
capability usage of the ScanBox framework, residing in Clusters 1 and 2
respectively.

Unveiling Song Yubo and Southeast University:
The Professor
We conducted open source research in pursuit of further information on the
TopSec_2014@163[.]com email registrant. A keyword search returned several
results for “topsec2014@163[.]com” in association with a number of academic
institutions in Nanjing, China. Although the email address wasn’t an exact match to
the topsec2014[.]com domain registrant (notice the absence of the underscore),
such a similarity warranted further investigation.

We examined the links for any relevant intelligence, and discovered that nearly all of
the search results led to pages that contained an announcement for an information
security competition sponsored by the Southeast University-Topsec Information
Security and Mobile Internet Technology Joint Research Center. This entity
appears to be a joint research venture between the University and Chinese
networking giant Beijing Topsec Network Security Technology Co., a.k.a. Beijing
Topsec.

The announcements list a Professor “Song Yubo” as the point of contact for the
event, and directs interested parties to his email address, topsec2014@163[.]com,
for further questions.

According to his LinkedIn page, Song is a Teacher at the Southeast University,
speciﬁcally interested in the ﬁeld of telecommunications. Additionally, he is an avid
researcher, and has published numerous academic papers on computer network
exploitation on various e-journal publication sites, such as Google Scholar. Further,
he lists skills such as “cryptography,” “penetration testing” and “computer network
security,” etc. on his Research Gate proﬁle.

As we continued to develop a proﬁle on Professor Song, we began to have the
sense that his interest in information security research strongly overlapped with that
of someone who might be interested in or at least capable of conducting
sophisticated cyber attacks. However, interests alone are not enough to warrant
reasonable suspicion, so we had to do more digging.
Additionally, the soft link between TopSec_2014@163[.]com and
topsec2014@163[.]com alone was not sufﬁcient to make associations with any
reasonable conﬁdence, but as it turns out, Yubo has in fact been previously named
as a person of interest in the context of offensive Chinese cyber activity.

The University
In March 2012, Northrop Grumman presented acommissioned report to Congress
detailing Chinese cyber warfare capabilities. The report asserts with high
conﬁdence that both Song and the Information Security Research Center at
Southeast University have received numerous state-sponsored research grants,
and by extension, cooperated with the Government of China in conducting
information security research and development (R&D). As stated on Southeast
University’s own website, the main purpose of these grants are to develop technical

University’s own website, the main purpose of these grants are to develop technical
acumen amongst its students via providing support for “state-owned scientiﬁc
research institutions, state key enterprises, government agencies and People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) units.”

Southeast University is one of only three Chinese academic institutes that receives
funding from all ﬁve of the State grant programs. Song himself has also conducted
his fair share of state-sponsored research, notably under the National Ministry of
State Security 115 Program – a highly sensitive research grant to fund ambiguous
information warfare R&D, almost certainly in support of PLA programs.

The Competition
As we can see, the evidence continued to stack up. The real smoking gun,
however, was when we began to notice a strong temporal overlap with the various
stages of the TOPSEC Cup that Song and Beijing Topsec were organizing, and the
registration dates of malicious infrastructure as well as the malware compilation
dates.

Based upon the translated registration form that we obtained from Song Yubo’s
personal Baidu document sharing account, open registration for the “TOPSEC Cup”
began on May 4th, 2014 and would close on May 14th, 2014.
The details of the competition that were shared on the announcement are extremely
ambiguous, and probably for good reason. The introductory paragraph mentions
that the primary goal of the event is to facilitate the training and discovery of new
talent, noting that exceptional participants would receive priority consideration for
internships and jobs with Beijing Topsec.
The event itself was broken down into several distinct rounds of competition. Firstly,
the preliminary round required that all eligible registrants would attempt to remotely
access and navigate through the network. Should a participating team perform
exceptionally in the preliminary qualifying round, they would be invited to participate
in the ﬁnal round on-site in Nanjing.
In this ﬁnal round, participants would be required to build their own “information
systems and network environments.” The announcement notes that the students
must rely upon their own laptop and software tools to accomplish this task. Further,
the announcement notes that participants are prohibited from attacking the provided
server as well as their competitors.

Section Summary:
Song Yubo and his research center at Southeast University appear to be central
players in this narrative, as highlighted by their ﬁnancial connections to the
government of China, in particular the Ministry of State Security (MSS), China’s
premier human intelligence agency.
If the MSS was involved, we can deduce that the Anthem hack could have been
for the purposes of gathering sensitive information for follow-on HUMINT
targeting via blackmail, asset recruitment or technical targeting operations against
individuals at home.
Song’s use of the topsec email alias suggests a greater association w/ TOPSEC.
It seems as if the competition is almost certainly the cause for the
topsec2014[.]com domain. What is very curious, however, is the initial

topsec2014[.]com domain. What is very curious, however, is the initial
registration by the reseller li2384826402@yahoo[.]com, which is a tactic seen
within the conﬁrmed malicious faux VAE Inc.infrastructure.
The overlap between the competition website and the static command and
control infrastructure seen in the Derusbi / Sakula implant is was likely an error
made by the attackers.

Tianrongxin, a.k.a. Beijing Topsec Technology
Co:
The Company
To enhance our open-source capabilities, we partnered up withDr. James Mulvenon
and his team of China experts at Defense Group, Inc. (DGI). We shared with them
everything that we knew at the time, walking through the technical details which led
us all the way to Song Yubo and the competition announcement. From there, they
were able to uncover a wealth of very consequential background information on
Beijing Topsec Technology Co (Beijing Topsec), the sponsoring organization for
Song Yubo’s information security competition.
DGI’s research indicated that Beijing Topsec is one of the largest information
security hardware providers in China. In 1996, they were the ﬁrst Chinese company
to break into the market with the release of China’s ﬁrst indigenously-manufactured
ﬁrewall. Since then, they have expanded their business to include a consulting
practice focused on issues such as vulnerability mining, software code analysis,
threat intelligence, and encryption R&D, amongst other things.
The company served as a core technical support unit for network security at the
2008 Olympic Games – an event which was tightly controlled by the state.
Additionally, Beijing Topsec is a known partner of the Chinese military. Since 2009,
the company has possessed information publication credentials for military network
procurement. Since 2013, they have been publicly recognized as the Chinese
equivalent of a cleared defense contractor.
The links between Beijing Topsec and the Chinese government are fairly
substantial, highlighted by long-standing partnerships between even the most
shadowy elements of the Chinese military.

The Leaked Cable
A very compelling piece of evidence is found in the contents of a leaked 2009
diplomatic security cable from the Department of State, published by The Guardian.

diplomatic security cable from the Department of State, published by The Guardian.
The cable is a daily digest of Diplomatic Security alerts – essentially a situational
awareness primer for State Department employees to inform them of new and
existing threats. In one section, the cable highlights that the Founder of Beijing
Topsec, He Weidong, had openly talked about receiving directives from the PLA in
an interview with China News Network. In the interview, the founder quite curiously
states that Topsec is less a commercial entity, but rather a research institute, and
that the company received about half of its start-up capital directly from the PLA.
The cable further claims that Topsec actively recruits for the PLA cyber army.

It would also appear that not only does Beijing Topsec have deep ties to state-run
cyber activity, but also within the independent hacker community as well. Of note,
the company hired the notorious hacker Lin Yong, a.k.a. “Lion” (of the Honker Union
of China) in the early 2000s as a security service engineer and to conduct network
training.

Section Summary:
It is not surprising that the Chinese government would be interested in partnering
with a private organization such as Beijing Topsec for use as a front for statesponsored activity.
The association between Southeast University and Beijing Topsec as manifested
in the joint information security research center highlights the possibility of
growing links between state-sponsored activity and academic institutions,
particularly those that receive funding from the central government.
All in all, it would seem that China is pursuing a uniﬁed approach to cyber
operations, relying on all unique facets of the workforce: academia, private
industry, and independent hackers, as well as the PLA to achieve their strategic
goals.

Conclusion:
The Anthem breach exposes the insidious reality of modern Chinese cyber
espionage as it continues its unrelenting strikes at the soft underbelly of the

espionage as it continues its unrelenting strikes at the soft underbelly of the
American way of life. Moreover, it demonstrates the imposing yet increasingly
common reality of conducting threat intelligence analysis without substantial threat
intelligence to start with. Fortunately for us, we were able to deduce informed
answers to some of the outstanding questions to this breach by scrutinizing our
archival data troves that are efﬁciently stored within our Threat Intelligence Platform
and partner integrations. In the ﬁeld of cyber security, industry professionals must
learn to play the long game in order to generate a proactive sense of situational
awareness, allowing for greater efﬁciency and ﬂexibility in mitigating future threats.
Additionally, this incident underscores the frustrating disparity of the industry when it
comes to naming conventions. With so many threat actors and indicators ﬂoating
around, it is can be frustrating to keep track of all the disparate pieces of evidence,
especially when countless naming conventions are applied. Without the use of a
Threat Intelligence Platform to keep track of the ﬂood of incoming threat data, this
task would be extraordinarily time consuming at best and crippling at worst.
Moving forward, it is important to bear in mind that the adversary, regardless of
country of origin, shall almost certainly leverage our every weakness against us.
Even something as seemingly innocuous as confusion over names can easily
consume analytical bandwidth, creating a window of opportunity to strike. We – that
is security professionals, private industry and governments alike – must proactively
harden our network defenses and hasten our incident responses as a united,
synchronous entity.
We have shared details on Song Yubo and afﬁliated indicators within the
ThreatConnect Common Community. This share also includes the full-text DGI
“BLUE HERON” research which provides greater insight into Song Yubo, Southeast
University and Beijing Topsec.

the hopes of rebufﬁng future attacks. The most resolute defense we have is each
