The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning to private
company partners that the HelloKitty ransomware group (aka FiveHands) has added
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to their extortion methods. Coordinating with the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI explained that the
ransomware group will shut down their victims’ websites in DDoS attacks if they refuse the
ransom demands. The HelloKitty ransomware group is known for extracting sensitive data
from the victims’ compromised servers before encrypting them. By using the exfiltrated files
as leverage, the threat actors pressure victims into paying the ransom by threatening to
release the stolen data on their data leak website.

According to the FBI, the threat actors implement a DDoS attack on a company’s public
website if they refuse to pay the ransom or do not respond quickly. HelloKitty (FiveHands)
actors demand customized Bitcoin (BTC) ransom payments equivalent to each victim’s ability
to pay. The threat actors either post the stolen data on their Babuk site “payload.bin” or sell it
to a third-party data broker if the victim does not pay the ransom. The HelloKitty operators
utilize several tactics and techniques to breach the targeted networks, including
compromised credentials and security flaws in recently patched SonicWall products,
including CVE-2021-20016, CVE-2021-20021, CVE-2021-20022, and CVE-2021-2002.
In November 2020, HelloKitty began as a human-operated ransomware group and quickly
attracted the FBI’s attention in January 2021. In February, the group was responsible for
breaching and encrypting the CD Projekt Red systems and stealing source codes from
Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3, Gwent, and other games. Although it was never confirmed,
HelloKitty claimed that the stolen CD Projekt Red files were purchased by a third party. The
ransomware group has been using a Linux variant targeting VMware’s ESXi virtual machine
platform since July 2021. HelloKitty is one of many ransomware groups targeting Linux
servers after companies switch to virtual machines for more efficient resource use and easier
device management. Ransomware operators can simultaneously encrypt multiple servers
with a single command by targeting a company’s virtual machines, saving the group time and
effort. HelloKitty was increasingly active in July and August since they started using the Linux
variant in their attacks, according to victim submissions on the ID Ransomware platform.
To assist cybersecurity professionals and system administrators in guarding their networks
against coordinated HelloKitty ransomware attacks, the FBI added an extensive collection of
indicators of compromise (IOCs) in their alert. With ransomware groups like HelloKitty adding
more complex extortion techniques, including DDoS, to their attack arsenal, it’s crucial that
companies view paying threat actors the ransom as a “last resort”. Groups like HelloKitty will
deploy different extortion tactics, like DDoS, to squeeze payments out of victims.
