SolarWinds Orion API authentication bypass allows
remote command execution
kb.cert.org/vuls/id/843464

Overview
The SolarWinds Orion API is vulnerable to authentication bypass that could allow a remote
attacker to execute API commands.

Description
The SolarWinds Orion Platform is a suite of infrastructure and system monitoring and
management products. The SolarWinds Orion API is embedded into the Orion Core and is
used to interface with all SolarWinds Orion Platform products. API authentication can be
bypassed by including specific parameters in the Request.PathInfo portion of a URI
request, which could allow an attacker to execute unauthenticated API commands. In
particular, if an attacker appends a PathInfo parameter of WebResource.axd ,
ScriptResource.axd , i18n.ashx , or Skipi18n to a request to a SolarWinds Orion
server, SolarWinds may set the SkipAuthorization flag, which may allow the API request to
be processed without requiring authentication.
This vulnerability, also known as CVE-2020-10148, is the vulnerability that SolarWinds has
indicated to have been used to install the malware known as SUPERNOVA.
We have created a python3 script to check for vulnerable SolarWinds Orion servers:
swcheck.py

Impact
This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute API
commands which may result in a compromise of the SolarWinds instance.

Solution
Apply an Update
Users should update to the relevant versions of the SolarWinds Orion Platform:
2019.4 HF 6 (released December 14, 2020)
2020.2.1 HF 2 (released December 15, 2020)
2019.2 SUPERNOVA Patch (released December 23, 2020)
2018.4 SUPERNOVA Patch (released December 23, 2020)
2018.2 SUPERNOVA Patch (released December 23, 2020)

Harden the IIS Server
Especially in cases when updates cannot be installed, we recommend that users implement
these mitigations to harden the IIS server.
