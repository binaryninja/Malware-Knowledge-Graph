Upgraded version of RAT with new TTPs
A Remote Administration Tool is a type of software that gives the attacker full control over the victims’
device remotely. Using RATs, attackers can perform various tasks such as accessing files, cameras, and
other resources remotely while conducting keylogging, system operations, etc.
A developer named “Arsium” posted a new version of this open-source RAT – EagleMonitorRAT – on
GitHub. Additionally, the developer posted a link to the GitHub page of the EagleMonitorRAT to various
underground dark web markets. Figure 1 shows one such post by the developer.

According to the developer, the EagleMonitorRAT is written in C# and upgraded from HorusEyesRat,
which is Visual Basic .NET-based.
Cyble Research Labs has analyzed the RAT binary and panel to gain insights into the functionalities and
impact of the RAT.

RAT Details
While building the solution, various executables and support plugins are compiled, including client
builder plugins and an admin panel. Figure 2 shows the compiled binaries and other files.

Additionally, various Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files are also compiled to support operations such as file
management, keylogging, etc. Figure 3 shows the support DLL files.

A client builder is used to compile the binary, which will be delivered to users to compromise a target
machine. The client binary may be delivered to users using various initial infection vectors such as spam
email etc. The builder has an option to specify the IP address of the server, port, and key. Figure 4
shows the client builder.

EagleMonitorRAT has a server panel for managing victim devices. The panel shows country, hardware
ID, operating system details, username, available RAM, privilege, region etc. Additionally, the panel has
various options to manage as well for performing several operations in the infected device.
The Admin panel of EagleMonitorRAT includes operations such as:
recovery
desktop
miscellaneous panels
mass tasks
memory execution
information
client
Figure 5 shows the administration panel of EagleMonitorRAT.

In the recovery option of EagleMonitorRAT, there are three different options – passwords, history, and
autofill.
The Recovery option works as an information stealer which extracts usernames, passwords, and
browser history. Figure 6 shows stolen information retrieved using the Recovery menu from the victim’s
machine.

Miscellaneous Options of EagleMonitorRAT
EagleMonitorRAT also has a menu option to discover the network connection and get the CPU
information of the infected system. Figure 15 shows the network connection and CPU information.

The RAT panel has a menu option to remotely shutdown, reboot, log out, BSOD, lock the workstation,
hibernate and suspend the victim’s system. Figure 16 showcases these options.

Conclusion
RATs have steadily become stealthier and more efficient with new techniques in place. Various
cybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat Groups have leveraged RATs in the past.
Cyble has observed data breaches in high-profile organizations due to such threats. Since EagleMonitor
is an open-source RAT, it is possible that threat actors could create and deploy custom variations for
future attacks. Organizations and individuals should thus continue to follow industry best cybersecurity
practices.

Our Recommendations:
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their
authenticity.
Educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.
Block URLs that could be used to spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
