ICS-CERT Year -in-Rev iew — 2012

Welcome
This year, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency
Response Team (ICS-CERT) developed tools and capabilities
to assist asset owners with incident handling and response
efforts. ICS-CERT correlates emerging cyber incidents with
previous events and tracks known threat actors based on
their techniques and tactics. The information these tools
and capabilities yield is leveraged to provide situational
awareness information for the greater industrial control
system community.
Our team accomplished several key initiatives in 2012
including:
• Developed incident handling and response guidance/
training for asset owners, including tools to assist in
forensic data gathering and analysis;
• Improved watch floor operational capabilities, data
fusion, and data analysis capabilities to correlate events
and disseminate data;
• Developed a hands-on Control Systems Forensics
for Law Enforcement course to train personnel in
gathering, handling, and preserving forensic data;
• Published relevant information products and
cybersecurity guidance for protecting against emerging
threats, mitigating common vulnerabilities, and
implementing best recommended practices;

• Improved relationships with the critical infrastructure
and key resources (CIKR) community to share
critical information and raise awareness by leveraging
knowledge of new vulnerabilities to reduce risk across
all sectors; and
• Updated policy related to researcher attribution
in alerts and advisories to support coordinated
disclosures.
Cybersecurity is a journey, not a destination. ICS-CERT will
continue to enhance our ability to identify weaknesses
and emerging vulnerabilities, take the necessary steps to
implement change, and maintain adequate security measures
to defend against the continuously evolving threats.
As we move into 2013, we are anxious to hear from you.
Establishing a strong posture of continuous information
exchange is essential to reducing cybersecurity incidents
and improving the overall security posture of our Nation’s
critical infrastructure.
Regards,

Marty Edwards

Organization
Recognizing the importance of control systems to our
critical infrastructure, the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) supported the Control System Security
Program’s (CSSP) mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s
critical infrastructure by strengthening control systems
cybersecurity through public-private partnerships.
The ICS-CERT is aligning to facilitate the expansion of
those essential capabilities in support of Cybersecurity &
Communications (CS&C). CS&C will provide guidance
to promote operational efficiencies and transition of
responsibilities and mission objectives to ICS-CERT.
ICS-CERT will continue to provide the same essential
products, services, and support to critical infrastructure
asset owners and operators, vendors, government agencies,
and others.
In 2012, ICS-CERT served as a primary component of the
National Cybersecurity and Communication Integration
Center (NCCIC) and contributed to the NCCIC’s growing
mission and capabilities.

ICS-CERT continues to accomplish its mission to reduce
cybersecurity risks to the Nation’s critical infrastructure by
establishing and operating under its four core functional
areas:
1. Providing situational awareness through alerts
and advisories to warn of cyber-based threats and
vulnerabilities affecting critical infrastructure assets;
2. Conducting technical analysis of malware, digital
media, system vulnerabilities, and emerging exploits;
3. Performing incident response to support asset owners
with discovery, analysis, and recovery efforts; and
4. Coordinating and monitoring control system
vulnerabilities in collaboration with the cyber research
and vendor communities.
These four core functions are supported by a foundation of
partnering with the control system stakeholder community
to facilitate cyber risk mitigation activities.

Outreach
The ICS-CERT is organized to support the Strategy for
Securing Control Systems, which outlines a longterm,
common vision where effective risk management of
control systems security can be realized through successful
coordination efforts. ICS-CERT recognizes that outreach
plays an important role in those coordination efforts.
In 2012, ICS-CERT provided nearly 60 briefings to 500
industry partners across the 18 critical infrastructure
sectors, including multiple classified threat briefings to
industry organizations that have developed programs for
security-cleared personnel. The following is a sampling of
the sector briefings:
• Electrical Sector Information Sharing and Acquisition
Centers (ISAC),

4

• Combined Chemical and Oil and Natural Gas ISACs,
• Water ISAC,
• Cyber Threat Intelligence Coordination Working Group
(CTICG),
• Transportation Security Sector Cyber Working Group
(TSSCWG), and
• Nuclear Sector Specific Agency (NSSA).
In addition, ICS-CERT attended over 200 events to promote
awareness among critical infrastructure owners, operators, and
vendors. This level of engagement supports the continuous
development of resources to help industry understand
and prepare for ongoing and emerging control systems
cybersecurity issues, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.

ICS-CERT Year -in-Rev iew — 2012

Industrial Control Systems
Joint Working Group
ICS-CERT’s outreach strategy has leveraged the Industrial
Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) to engage
a broad range of partners, including critical infrastructure
sector specific agencies; other federal, state, local, and
tribal government agencies; national, trans and subnational
groups and councils; fusion centers; vendors; researchers
and academia; infrastructure owners and operators; and
international partners, including various CERTs.
In 2012, ICSJWG had one of the most successful years
to date with membership expanding to more than 1,400
industrial control systems (ICS) professionals. The increased
coordination between various ICS professionals and
cybersecurity organizations was mirrored at the Spring and
Fall 2012 ICSJWG meetings.
Highlights include the following.
• The ICS-CERT participated in panels fostering open
dialog about control systems vulnerabilities and how the
community can work together to mitigate these issues.

• The Introduction to Control Systems Cybersecurity
training course was taught to more than 115 meeting
attendees at the Spring meeting and the Intermediate
Cybersecurity Industrial Control Systems Training was
taught to over 65 participants at the Fall meeting.
• ICS-CERT hosted its first International Day featuring
information sharing sessions, goal discussions, and
conversations about a possible path forward for creating
a new ICSJWG international subgroup.
• Marty Edwards provided an ICS threat brief and
overview to meeting attendees at the Fall meeting.  
• International attendees were invited to attend the world
renowned “hands-on” Industrial Control Systems
Cybersecurity Advanced Training held at the ICS-CERT
training facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho.
Moving forward, we will continue to promote growth and
collaboration in the ICSJWG community through publicprivate partnership.

• The subgroup meetings allowed participants to discuss
in depth the current status of subgroup activities and
report accomplishments to the community.

Advanced Analytical Laboratory
ICS-CERT provides expertise for response and analysis of
cyber incidents affecting the ICS community through the
Advanced Analytical Laboratory (AAL). One such example
in 2012 was the spear-phishing campaign against the oil
and natural gas sector. AAL worked directly with a dozen
energy and manufacturing companies affected by the
campaign, providing digital media and log file analyses
to identify compromised hosts. During the course of this
response effort, AAL analyzed over 50 malware samples
and malicious files, 20 emails, and 38 hard drive images
to determine the extent of the compromise and identify
the techniques and tactics used by the threat actors. By
analyzing malicious emails and malware samples, AAL was
able to provide indicators of compromise through alerts and
advisories to the ICS community to aid in detection efforts.
AAL provided onsite support to two affected companies,
helping determine the extent of the compromise and
providing mitigation recommendations.
The chemical sector was also the victim of targeted
spear-phishing attacks in 2012. AAL worked directly with
companies affected by this campaign, providing onsite
support, analyzing drive images and malware samples
6

and disseminating indicators back to the community. AAL
provided onsite support to one of the affected companies.
AAL also provides vulnerability verification and patch
validation for ICS products. AAL’s verification and validation
reports assist ICS-CERT Vulnerability Handlers with
developing product advisories for the ICS community.
In 2012, AAL enhanced its analysis capabilities with a core
information storage system. This system maintains forensic
information for all analysis activities and is integrated
with the AAL automated analysis environment. AAL also
developed a tool to scan whole drives for malware using
multiple antivirus engines. This tool greatly reduced the
time needed to scan multiple drive images with commercial
antivirus products.
ICS-CERT will continue to support AAL’s development of
tools and techniques available to ICS community members
affected by cyber incidents.

ICS-CERT Year -in-Rev iew — 2012

Cybersecurity Training
ICS-CERT offers cybersecurity training at no cost to
ICS professionals and managers across all sectors of
CIKR in order to support risk reduction efforts. These
training courses include Introduction to Control Systems
Cybersecurity, Intermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial
Control Systems, ICS Advanced Cybersecurity, and ICS
Security for Management. In 2012, over 2,200 ICS
professionals were trained.
2012 Training Highlights included the following.
• Provided 12 Advanced Training sessions, which are
week-long events that provide intensive hands-on
training and a 12-hour, red team/blue team exercise
that simulates a corporate espionage scenario.

• Delivered 52 training sessions across the country,
including Introduction to Control Systems
Cybersecurity (101), Intermediate Cybersecurity
for Industrial Control Systems lecture (201), and
Intermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control
Systems with lab (202).
• Provided demonstrations of how an ICS attack could
progress for high ranking government officials and
congressional staffers.
• Conducted our first regional training event in Atlanta,
Georgia. This event was so successful that ICS-CERT will
now conduct regional training on a regular basis.

• Developed a Control Systems Forensics for Law
Enforcement course. This course helps law enforcement
agents to understand the differences in performing
forensics on ICSs versus normal corporate enterprise
network forensics.

Cybersecurity Evaluations
ICS-CERT provides cybersecurity evaluations to support the
reliability and resiliency of the systems that comprise and
interconnect critical infrastructures. ICS-CERT develops and
implements coordinated security measures in collaboration
with partners from across public, private, and international
communities.
In 2012, ICS-CERT conducted 89 onsite assessments across
all CIKR. The objective of the assessment is to establish a
“baseline of performance” with regard to cybersecurity
maturity as defined within a suite of cybersecurity standards
and guidelines. Although the results may differ from sector
to sector, many of the vulnerabilities and weaknesses within
the networks are similar. This year has seen considerable
partnering with the Nuclear Industry, Oil and Gas Industry,
and Department of Defense with regard to performing onsite
cybersecurity assessments.

8

Cybersecurity assessments are now tailored to each individual
assessment depending on the level of complexity in the
system(s). Asset owners can now request Cybersecurity
Evaluation Tool (CSET®) evaluations and/or Architecture
Reviews, which is a more in-depth comprehensive evaluation
of specific control systems networks, architectures, and
components.

ICS-CERT Year -in-Rev iew — 2012

Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool

Standards Support

The ICS-CERT foundation tool for onsite assessments is
our CSET®. In 2012, over 5,500 CSETs® were distributed
and downloaded. Version 4.1 was released in January 2012
and incorporated integration with Microsoft Visio. This
functionality allows users to develop a diagram in Visio and
then map and export it to CSET® where component questions
are generated. It also allows for a diagram created in CSET® to
be imported into Visio with all the CSET® metadata preserved.
A new stencil of CSET® components for Visio was also
included as part of the installation package.

A broad range of standards exists to support the CSET® tool
across CIKR. ICS-CERT executes a comprehensive approach
to standards by providing assistance to standards bodies,
promoting awareness of accepted standards and providing
tools, like CSET® to asset owners, to evaluate compliance.
The ICS-CERT continues to engage with cross-sector industry
partners to develop new cybersecurity standards and
enhancement of existing standards. The ICS-CERT provides
key support to:

ICS-CERT released CSET® 5.0, in January 2013, this version
represents the most significant upgrade in the underlying
technical architecture of the tool. This upgrade involves
conversion to the Microsoft.NET framework environment as
well as utilization of component pieces from Syncfusion. In
addition, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) was incorporated into the new version to allow those
with disabilities a way to interact with and use the CSET®.

• the ISA-99 Working Groups,
• International Standard Organization (ISO)/
International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC),
• the National Institute of Standards (NIST),
• Technology Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP),
• American Public Transportation Association (APTA), and
• ICSJWG Roadmap Subgroup.

Industrial Control Systems
Consequence Effects and Analysis
ICS-CERT supports the development of leading edge tools to
foster an environment of collaboration and provide unique
forensic capabilities to address cybersecurity challenges
specific to ICS.
The Industrial Control Systems Consequence Effects and
Analysis (ICS-CEA) framework is a collaboration tool.
ICS-CEA provides a critical infrastructure modeling and
simulation capability. The tool also provides a means for
users to model, analyze, and share information related to
potential consequences of naturally occurring or man-made
threats on our Nation’s critical infrastructure. The ICS-CEA
system provides the NCCIC a capability for daily use of
modeling, simulation, analysis, and information sharing
related to potential cross-sector “consequence” effects to ICS
and their related CIKR sectors.

10

In 2012, ICS-CEA has been used for responding to multiple
requests by the NCCIC regarding the identification of
potentially affected CIKR because of natural and potential
man-made threats. These events have included analysis
support for the Super Bowl, national level exercises,
and others related on our Nation’s energy, water, and
transportation infrastructure.
ICS-CERT’s suite of tools provides analysis to improve
security posture as well as identify the appropriate
cybersecurity mitigation measures. ICS-CERT continues to
cultivate capabilities in collaboration and forensics to span
the gap between ICS, information technology, and the user
interface to provide advanced industrial analysis to enhance
cybersecurity.

ICS-CERT Year -in-Rev iew — 2012

Taking Action
ICS-CERT works with critical infrastructure asset owners
and operators to respond to cyber incidents that have
the potential to impact ICS. ICS-CERT works with the
affected organizations to offer subject matter expertise for
immediate actions to mitigate the compromise and develop
strategies for recovery and future defenses. The mitigation
strategies are specific to the incident and individual needs of
the organizations.
ICS-CERT is a component of the NCCIC, bringing
ICS security technical and response capabilities to the
partnership. The work is performed in conjunction with the
NCCIC and furthers its overall mission to coordinate defense
against and response to cyber attacks across the Nation.
In 2012, ICS-CERT responded to a steady stream of
cyber incidents, coordinated researcher-discovered ICS
vulnerabilities with vendors, and produced alerts and
advisories to notify the ICS community. These situational
awareness products provide actionable information about
mitigation and protection strategies for implementing
sound security practices.
This year, ICS-CERT received and responded to 138
incidents as reported by asset owners and industry partners.
In 2012, attacks against the energy sector represented over
40 percent of all incidents reported to ICS-CERT. In roughly
half of these incidents, information pertaining to the
ICS/SCADA environment, including data that could facilitate

remote unauthorized operations, was targeted in these
incidents. ICS-CERT also deployed on site incident response
teams to assist various critical infrastructure operators with
efforts to mitigate cyber intrusions. The on site teams
were able to help identify the extent of the intrusion and
develop strategies for recovery and improving the operator’s
defensive posture and future detection capabilities. The AAL
played a key role in the response; providing support for
analysis of hard drives, log files, and malware artifacts. The
AAL also developed the guidelines found in the paper on
Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies.a
Vulnerability analysis and coordination activities continued
to increase with more researchers using ICS-CERT as a
conduit for coordination with ICS vendors. The ICS-CERT
AAL also provided analytic support to vendors to perform
proof-of-concept testing and patch validation. Many
of those vulnerabilities resulted in ICS-CERT alerts and
advisories on the US-CERT secure portal and on the public
Web site.
In 2012, ICS-CERT published 342 information products
warning the ICS community about various vulnerabilities
and threats that could potentially impact control systems.
ICS-CERT also published the Incident Summary Reportb
to summarize cyber incidents, onsite deployments, and
associated findings from 2009 through 2011.

approach provides scalable response to cybersecurity
challenges across critical infrastructures. ICS-CERT works to
prevent or minimize disruptions to our critical information
infrastructure in order to protect the public, economy,
government services, and the overall security of the United
States. This is accomplished through a series of continuous
efforts designed to further safeguard systems by reducing
potential vulnerabilities, protecting against cybersecurity
and communications intrusions or disruptions, and
anticipating future threats.

• Goal 3: Support robust preparedness planning and
facilitate effective incident response capabilities.

• Goal 1: Foster public-private partnerships to plan,
coordinate, and support ICS cybersecurity initiatives.
• Goal 2: Serve as a global clearinghouse for information
associated with the security of ICS.

• Goal 4: Support increased awareness of control systems
security issues and improved technical expertise for
stakeholders.
• Goal 5: Ensure that ICS-CERT is an adaptive and
prepared organization that effectively plans for,
anticipates, and manages future risks and disruptions.
In 2012, ICS-CERT served as a primary component of the
NCCIC and contributed to the NCCIC’s growing mission
and capabilities.

Under ICS-CERT, AAL’s future development plans include
automated tools for registry analysis, timelining, and pdf
analysis.
