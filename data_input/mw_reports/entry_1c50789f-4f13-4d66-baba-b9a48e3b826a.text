On September 16, 2020, the United States Justice Department announced that it was
charging five Chinese citizens with hacking crimes committed against over 100 institutions in
the United States and abroad. The global hacking campaign went after a diverse range of
targets, from video game companies and telecommunications enterprises to universities and
non-profit organizations. The five individuals were reportedly connected to the hacking group
known as APT41. At the time of writing, they remain fugitives, but two Malaysian citizens
have been arrested for aiding the hackers.

Three related indictments unsealed by the Justice Department laid out the group's wide
range of malicious activities, including crypto-jacking and ransomware attacks. Most of the
activities appear to have been done for profit, but some were for espionage purposes.
Justice officials say that the group's intrusions allowed the hackers to steal source code,
customer account data, and personally identifiable information (PII). Other notable activities
include defrauding video game companies by manipulating in-game resources, and
launching a ransomware attack on the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to
combating global poverty.
The hackers used publicly available exploits and common vulnerabilities, which are listed in
the official report. They also employed sophisticated hacking techniques to gain and maintain
access to the victim's computer networks. The official report outlined how the team used
"supply chain attacks" in which they compromised software providers and modified the code
they were giving their customers. This also allowed the threat actors to compromise the
customers and spread their influence further.
This is not the first time that APT41 activities have been scrutinized — the group has been
active for some time. Just last May, Trend Micro connected the group to ransomware attacks
on Taiwanese organizations. The new ransomware family, which we dubbed ColdLock, is
potentially destructive as it appears to target databases and email servers for encryption.
The attack chain of ransomware incidents in Taiwan
The Trend Micro Research team investigated the ColdLock ransomware attack, which
actually targeted the energy industry in Taiwan. The ransomware attack chain is outlined in
Figure 1; however, we currently do not know the initial arrival vector of this threat into a
potential victim's network. Our analysis focused on the way the attacker spreads the
ransomware to infect as many machines as possible.
1. The threat actor enters a victim's network environment and obtains the account
username and password of the company headquarters' active directory server.
2. After logging in to the active directory server, the threat actor modifies the active
directory server group policy object — this includes a request that all domain account
members create a scheduled task and execute the malware.
3. In the final step, the other subsidiary active directory servers and all the endpoint
machines will download the scheduled task and execute the ransomware.

Figure.1 The attacker uses an Active Directory (AD) scheduled task to deploy the
ransomware in the customer environment.
Scheduled tasks play a very important role in this incident. The threat actors use a scheduled
task command to spread and infect a victim's environment. The screenshot in Figure 2
shows how the threat actor uses SMB and internal IIS Web Service to copy "lc.tmp" (the
main ransomware loader in this incident) to other victims' host machines. After that, the
PowerShell command executes the main ransomware loader.

The right tool for the job
Before the ransomware attack, the attacker was likely already hiding in the victims'
environments for some time. We found the same customized loaders installed as Windows
services in every victim's environment, and those infected machines were in positions that
allowed them to reach other machines under the subnets.
The loaders decrypted the next-stage payloads, which were either embedded inside itself or
stored on the disk as separate files. The next-stage payloads were CobaltStrike in this series
of incidents. After the loader and payload pairs were successfully installed, the attacker
started poking around the environments with tools like password dumpers and HTTP
tunneling tools — then the ransomware attacks were launched one month later.
More than just a single occurrence
During the investigation, we discovered more incidents that are possibly related to the one
discussed above. We did this by checking the indicator overlap and the C&C infrastructure
overlap. Based on the distribution of the linked indicators, the attacker(s) appears to be
interested in energy, retail, and telecom companies, mainly in Southeast Asia. They mostly
conduct espionage activities — lurking in the environments for a long period and packing the
data that interested them. They also seem to be updating the backdoors and toolsets they
use.
Possible link to Chinese espionage
The C&C server 104[.]233[.]224[.]227 was hosted under a small hosting service with only 64
IPs under it. The IP range was registered to an address in Inner Mongolia, China. The C&C
server was abandoned several days after the incidents, and now the IP is hosting a
Simplified-Chinese site.
Trend Micro Solutions
Sophisticated hacking groups have versatile tools and are persistent threats. Users should
deploy more robust and proactive defenses to be adequately protected against these groups.
The following Trend Micro Solutions are recommended:
Trend Micro XDR for Users: Applies AI and analytics for earlier detection of threats
across endpoints and other layers of the system
Trend Micro Apex One™: Provides actionable insights, expanded investigative
capabilities, and centralized visibility across the network.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector: Detects, blocks, and analyzes
malicious email attachments through custom sandboxing and other detection
techniques

To help defend users against APT41 specifically, we have developed an assessment tool
that can scan endpoints for file-based indicators collected from global intelligence sources.
