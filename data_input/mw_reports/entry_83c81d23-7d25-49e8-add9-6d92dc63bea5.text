This report is a technical overview of the WhisperGate malware reported by
Microsoft Threat Intelligence on January 15, 2022. It is intended for those
looking for a high-level overview of the malware’s TTPs and mitigations.

Executive Summary
WhisperGate is a new malware family being used in an ongoing operation
targeting multiple industries in Ukraine, including government, non-profit, and
information technology organizations. The malware is a 3-stage master boot
record (MBR) wiper designed to destroy a victim’s MBR and corrupt files on
attached storage devices. Each stage of the malware has a discrete task: stage
1 overwrites the MBR with a ransom note and code to overwrite sections on
each drive found, stage 2 downloads and executes stage 3, which is hosted on
Discord’s CDN as a JPG attachment, and stage 3 corrupts any file that
matches a list of 191 file extensions. The developers of the malware use
obfuscation, particularly in stage 3, to evade detection and analysis.
WhisperGate wipes and corrupts a Windows system to the point where files
and drives are no longer recoverable or usable. Details around the motive for
WhisperGate and the threat actor behind the attacks are still emerging. These
attacks take place in the context of an escalating risk of a Russian invasion of
Ukraine and the Ukrainian government website defacements that occurred on
January 14, 2022.

Key Judgments
As of this writing, the threat actor group deploying WhisperGate has not
been attributed to any known threat groups, but other researchers
suspect the group is state sponsored.

1/6

The same precautions taken against ransomware with respect to data
backups should be applied to mitigate the effects of WhisperGate’s data
destruction capabilities.
WhisperGate malware has not been observed in use as part of any other
attacks outside of Ukraine, indicating it may have been developed
specifically for this operation.

Background
On January 15, 2022, Microsoft reported a destructive malware operation
targeting multiple organizations in Ukraine. This activity has not been
attributed to any existing threat actor group and is therefore being tracked
using Microsoft's DEV-#### naming convention, which is used to track
unknown emerging clusters of threat activity. This group has been given the
designation DEV-0586 until it is eventually converted to a named actor or
merged with an existing actor. Microsoft started seeing this malicious activity on
January 13, 2022, which led to the investigation that uncovered a new malware
family that is being tracked as WhisperGate.

WhisperGate Technical Analysis
The WhisperGate malware has 3 stages, detailed below in Figure 1. All 3
stages must be executed prior to the machine rebooting for maximum effect.
Stage 1 corrupts the MBR of the victim’s boot disk and upon reboot will corrupt
other drives on the system. Stage 2 downloads stage 3, which is used to
corrupt files on attached file systems and network drives. File damage will
occur if even just one of either stage 1 or stage 2 executes successfully. In
testing, we found that GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks are not irreparably
destroyed by WhisperGate’s stage 1 malware and therefore are partially
immune to that stage of the malware. We speculate that the inclusion of stage
2 and 3 may be a way to ensure that victims using GPT-style boot disks are
affected by the malware too. However, stage 3 also targets remote network
drives, which would cause further damage regardless of the partitioning
scheme used by the victim’s boot disk.

Stage 1: Overwrite Master Boot Record (MBR)
Stage 1 is compiled using the Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW)
development environment, which supports GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
6.3.0 on Windows. The binary’s primary objective is to overwrite the MBR of
“\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0” with a custom MBR whose effect won’t be seen until the
machine reboots. At startup, the computer’s BIOS determines the disk order to
2/6

use when looking for the MBR. Overwriting the MBR on PhysicalDrive0 is
making an assumption that that disk is the first one in line to be checked by the
BIOS, which is normally a reasonable assumption. Once the machine reboots
and the custom MBR code executes, the user is presented with the ransom
note displayed in Figure 2.

of WhisperGate is executed (Source: Recorded Future)
After displaying the ransom note, the MBR code overwrites sections of each
drive, on 199-byte intervals, with the contents shown in Figure 3. The content
written to each drive differs at the sixth byte, incrementing sequentially from
0x00.

Recorded Future)
The MBR code writes the content multiple times to each drive by making
extended write function calls via interrupt 0x13, as shown in Figure 4.

sections on each disk found (Source: Recorded Future)
In the event that a victim is using GPT-style partition tables on their boot disk,
then stage 1 will not be effective. Upon reboot, Windows will not be able to
boot; however, WhisperGate’s MBR code, which corrupts the disk drives, will
not run. Since GPT disks maintain a backup copy of the GPT table at the end
of a disk, victims can restore the GPT table by running a live Linux distribution
and using the gdisk utility’s recovery command like shown in Figure 5.

command (Source: Recorded Future)

Stage 2: Downloader
Stage 2 is written in .NET, and its primary functionality is to download the third
stage of the malware and execute it. It begins execution after 20 seconds,
using the PowerShell command “powershell -enc
UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAALQBzACAAMQAwAA==”,
which decodes to “Start-Sleep -s 10”. The 10-second delay is executed twice
and is likely used to help the malware evade detection by AV engines. The
malware retrieves the third stage from a Discord attachment hosted on
https://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com, named Tbopbh.jpg. Stage 2 reverses the JPG
file’s bytes, reflectively loads the JPG file as a .NET assembly, and then calls
the exported function “Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph”.

Stage 3: File Corrupter

3/6

Stage 3 of the malware is written in .NET and obfuscated with eazfuscator.
Upon execution, 2 embedded PE executable resources (AdvancedRun and
Wagybg) are unpacked, decoded, and GZIP decompressed. Next, a .vbs script
is written to “%AppData%\local\Temp\Nmddfrqqrbyjeygggda.vbs” and executed
with Wscript.exe. The script, shown in Figure 6, is used to exclude the entire C
drive from being scanned by Windows Defender.

“%AppData%\local\Temp\Nmddfrqqrbyjeygggda.vbs” (Source: Recorded
Future)
AdvancedRun is then executed to stop the Windows Defender service and
delete its program data folder. AdvancedRun is benign software developed by
NirSoft and used to run programs under different settings. The author used
AdvancedRun due to its ability to run programs with TrustedInstaller privileges,
which are needed to execute the command that disables Windows Defender.
Figures 7 and 8 show the command line arguments used to run
AdvancedRun.exe. The use of the “/RunAs 8” argument instructs
AdvancedRun to use the TrustedInstaller privileges.

Finally, Wagybg is run via process hollowing in an InstallUtil.exe process. A
similar technique was used to load the Netwire trojan in 2019 as part of a
phishing campaign. InstallUtil is a benign program produced by Microsoft and
distributed as part of the .NET framework.
This stage of the malware is used to perform file corruption. It first gets a list of
logical drives on the system by calling GetLogicalDrives(), then identifies those
that are fixed media or network drives. The malware searches these drives for
files ending in 1 of the 191 file extensions shown in Figure 9 below. It then
corrupts matching files by overwriting the first 1 MiB of each file with 0xCC
bytes.

After it finishes corrupting files, the corrupter sends 5 ping requests to
111.111.111[.]111 and then deletes itself as shown in Figure 10. While it is
unclear exactly why the malware makes the ping requests, we speculate that it
could be to add a time delay before deleting itself or to keep a record of
infected hosts.

Mitigations
4/6

We recommend that organizations consider an offsite backup strategy to
protect their data from the destruction capabilities of the WhisperGate malware.
Network segmentation can prevent attackers and malware from gaining
access to other parts of an organization's network. This solution involves
splitting the larger network into smaller network segments and can be
accomplished through firewalls, virtual local area networks, and other
separation techniques.
Consider keeping sensitive client information on systems that are
disconnected from the internet or segmented from the rest of the
corporate network. Since WhisperGate malware will tamper with files on a
victim system, moving highly sensitive customer data to a system with no
internet access or access to the rest of the network will minimize the
access WhisperGate malware would have to those files.
Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention
systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on
— and, upon review, consider blocking connection attempts to and from
— the external IP address mentioned.
If remote access solutions are crucial to daily operations, all such remote
access services and protocols, such as Citrix and RDP, should be
implemented with two-factor or multi-factor authentication.
Monitor for the creation of suspicious file modification activity, particularly
large quantities of file modifications in user directories.
Set the Execution Policy for PowerShell to require that scripts be signed
in order to be executed. This will only be effective for scripts being run
traditionally (for example by double-clicking) and will not protect against
base64-encoded scripts executed on the command line as an argument
to the PowerShell program (such as powershell.exe <command>).
Use newer versions of PowerShell, such as version 5, which added some
security-related improvements.
AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI): This feature was introduced in
Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and provides “file and
memory or stream scanning, content source URL/IP reputation
checks, and other techniques” and can integrate with PowerShell,
UAC, Windows Script Host, JavaScript, VBScript, and Office VBA
Macros. Research into how AMSI can be bypassed indicates that
the use of obfuscation (such as XOR or base64-encoding “banned”
commands) or a simple execution bypass, among other more
sophisticated methods such as memory patching, can be used to
get around AMSI.

5/6

Ensure logging of scripts and commands is enabled. These include:
Module Logging (records pipeline execution of PowerShell scripts,
including some portions of the script, some deobfuscated code and some
data formatted for output), Script Block Logging (records execution,
including full contents of scripts and commands that are executed), and
Transcription (creates a unique record of each PowerShell session,
including input and output). While logging will not necessarily prevent
malicious PowerShell from executing, it could help with understanding
what kind of malicious behavior or indicators were involved.

Outlook
As of this writing, it appears that DEV-0586 has only been using WhisperGate
to target organizations in Ukraine. We expect more information about this threat
actor, including attribution, will be published over the next few days or weeks.
Now that WhisperGate has been publicly reported and security professionals
have been alerted to the malware, it is possible that the developers of
WhisperGate will alter the wiper to better evade detections.
