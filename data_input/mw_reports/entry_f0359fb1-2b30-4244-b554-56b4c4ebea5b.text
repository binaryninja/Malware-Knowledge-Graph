Intro
“TrickBot malware—first identified in 2016—is a Trojan developed and operated by a
sophisticated group of cybercrime actors. The cybercrime group initially designed
TrickBot as a banking trojan to steal financial data. Through continued development
and new functionality, TrickBot has become a highly modular, multi-stage malware that
provides its operators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities.
Since TrickBot’s inception, the cybercrime group has used the malware to attack
individuals and businesses globally across a wide range of sectors.”
Source – Fact Sheet: TrickBot Malware Source
In an intrusion this past month, threat actors were seen enumerating and collecting
information related to the domain as well as dumping passwords before leaving the network.
Multiple Cobalt Strike Beacons were deployed and remained connected despite the lack of
activity from the threat actors.

Case Summary
We assess, with moderate confidence, the Trickbot DLL that we executed was originally
delivered via a malicious Office document. The threat actors were observed leveraging
Trickbot and Cobalt Strike for C2 communication. They began their discovery by running net
and nltest commands as well as PowerView domain discovery modules. Minutes later,
Lazagne (“retrieve lots of passwords”) was executed using the “all” switch. A registry value
was set to enable storing logon credentials in plaintext in memory (WDigest), likely to
facilitate future activity as the host was not restarted for this change to take effect.
Before the threat actors departed the network, they successfully accessed the LSASS
process and retrieved credentials from memory. No lateral movement or execution on
mission was observed.

MITRE ATT&CK

3/15

Initial Access
We assess with moderate confidence that this DLL was dropped by a malicious Office
document.

Execution
Trickbot (click.php.dll) was manually executed on a single endpoint.
Source: https://tria.ge/210412-wmdnkzp5la

Trickbot, from its injected wermgr process, spawned a command process to then run a
PowerShell Cobalt Strike Beacon.

Reviewing the above PowerShell code, we can extract the shellcode to discover the IP and
User-agent string, the beacon will communicate with.

4/15

Getting the IP and port using scdbg.

The threat actor also executed a second Cobalt Strike Beacon (wsuC3C.tmp) using the
injected wermgr.exe process.

rundll32.exe C:\Users\redacted\AppData\Local\Temp\wsuC3C.tmp,ControlUnitSpeed

Persistence
A scheduled task was created to keep the Trickbot malware persistent on the system.

5/15

C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe"
"C:\Users\redacted\AppData\Roaming\DownloadMngNet5353711913\xxclickdr.dwn",#1

Defense Evasion
Trickbot injected into wermgr.exe processes and used this for communication to command
and control infrastructure.

6/15

Credential Access
Lazagne was used with the “all” switch, which runs all modules.

Below we can see registry hives being saved to disk.

LSASS was accessed by rundll32, but we did not see anything written to disk.

Trickbot was used to enable the storage of clear text credentials (WDigest) by setting
UseLogonCredential to 1.

7/15

Key - SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest
Value name - UseLogonCredential
Set value data - 1

Discovery
The following net commands were used by the threat actor from the injected Trickbot
process.
net config workstation
net view /all
net view /all /domain
net group “Domain Computers” /domain

The following nltest commands were used by the threat actor from the injected Trickbot
process.
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts

PowerView modules were also used by the threat actor executed from the Cobalt Strike
beacons.
Get-DomainSearcher
Get-NetComputer
Get-NetDomain

The local network was scanned for port 445/SMB.

8/15

ipconfig was used to show all IP info.
ipconfig /all
