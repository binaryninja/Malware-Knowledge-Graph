I founded Strategic Cyber LLC in 2012 to advocate a vision of threat-representative security
testing. Over time, Cobalt Strike became the de facto commercial standard for red team
operations and adversary simulations. I’ve long asked myself, how do I stay a good partner
to my customers as their numbers grow and this field evolves?
Today is a big step forward as Minnesota-based HelpSystems, LLC has acquired Strategic
Cyber. I have joined HelpSystems as a Technical Director for Cybersecurity. I will lead the
team that continues the R&D-driven releases of the Cobalt Strike product. The Cobalt Strike
product and business operations of Strategic Cyber will benefit from the experience and
resources at HelpSystems.
HelpSystems is a good fit for Strategic Cyber and its customers. The company was founded
in 1982 and is a cyber security company and the largest independent vendor in the IBM i
space. Their portfolio includes antivirus, identity and access management, secure file
transfer, intrusion detection, and security services for IBM i, Linux, and other platforms.
HelpSystems became successful through good products, partnership with their customers,
and taking care of their team.
HelpSystems is the parent company of Core Security, the creators of the Core Impact
penetration testing tool. Core Impact came to market in 2003, a time when exploits were
published by anonymous authors and the use of these exploits had safety and reliability
implications. Core Impact became the trusted product to automate penetration tests, exploit
the latest vulnerabilities, and pivot to new targets.
Cobalt Strike’s story is similar. Cobalt Strike came to market in 2012, a time when security
meant prevention of breaches with less thought on post-breach containment, detection, and
response. Cobalt Strike explored the post-breach offense problems of team collaboration,
1/2

flexible communications, and novel capability to demonstrate risks. When security teams
needed to emulate real-world attack scenarios to improve security operations and exercise
processes, Cobalt Strike became the natural choice.
I’m excited to explore the synergy between Cobalt Strike and Core Impact. Our work is to
share knowledge, offer real insight into risk, and drive objective and meaningful security
advances. As this field evolves, we will evolve with it.
