G Data Whitepaper 2018 – paper 3: Description for SocketPlayer

1.

Introduction

The twitter user @struppigel brought my attention to a post of @sudosev who found a RAT[1] on
virustotal which looks like a new malware family. The RAT is written in .NET and the source-code
can therefore be inspected easily. The RAT uses socket.io for communication which is not that
typical for malware hence it captured my attention.

2.

Initial routine of SocketPlayer

Firstly, the actual socket connection is created with the code line Socket.socket = IO.Socket(URL).
After that, the program checks whether the directory C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Player exists. If it
doesn’t, it will create that folder. Next it creates a registry key to the
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run path. Proceeding the autostart entry, the
program copies itself to the location C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Player\Player.exe
Lastly the actual socket connection is made with the socket.Emit function which passes the
following information to the c2: the username, the current date, the antivirus product name
(information about how this is achieved later) and the machine name. Some information like the
username is sent twice and the machine name is even sent thrice – no idea why the author did that.

3.

Commands

Command

Functionality

fdrive

Iterates through all drives that are ready and returns the name,
the total size and again, the name. If a drive isn’t ready, only the
name is returned.

fdir

If the specified directory isn’t on the system, false is returned.
Otherwise the path of the subdirectories, the creation date of
those, all files within the current directory, the file size and the
creation date of those is returned.

mfdir

Returns the filename, file size, creation time and the full name of
all the extensions that were specified recursively using the sndflesi
method.

f1

If the specified parameter is longer than 3 and contains “:\\” it will
return “f1|drive”. Otherwise it will return the name of the parent
directory.

strtsgnl

Returns the uid of the current running program.

fdowl

Using the sndfle function, a file is uploaded to the c2 using the
path /cl/upld/.

fexc

Executes a file if it exists.

fdel

Deletes a directory or file if it exists.

procs

Returns information about currently running processes like the
process name, whether the process responds, the window title
and the process id.

prockil

Kills a running process by id. After that the same information as in
procs is returned(to check if the process is terminated).

Gtscreen

A screenshot is made and returned.

upld

A specified file from the /uploads/ folder of the c2 is downloaded
and stored to the temporary directory. After that it’s executed.

upldex

Similar to upld but with specified location in the temporary
directory and an autostart entry for it as well.

kylgs

Reads the contents of the file “klsetup.txt” in the temporary
directory and returns them.

destt

Kills the active socket connection, removes the autostart key,
removes the created file and the path from the initial routine and
exits itself.

The command kylgs is possibly intended to serve as a keylogging feature as the name and the
partial functionality suggests it. However, no actual keylogging functionality has been
implemented and therefore the command is useless for now.

4.

AvName() function

The function AvName() uses the ManagementObjectSearcher class in order to enumerate the
currently installed antivirus product with the SQL query “SELECT * FROM AntivirusProduct”. As
multiple values are returned, the program targets the property value displayName as this value
contains the name of the antivirus product. The displayName value is returned. This function is
used in 2. Initial routine.

SocketPlayer downloader

At the current time of writing there are two variants of the SocketPlayer downloader out there. The
first variant is a ~100KB file which does exactly what a typical downloader does - downloading a file
and executing it. The second one is a little bit more complex and is described in 7. variant 2.

6.

Variant 1

According to virustotal version 1a[2] of the first variant was submitted on 2018-03-28. The variant
1b[3], which was submitted on 2018-03-31, is 5.5KB bigger. This is because the variant 1b contains
HTML file within its resources. Below is a screenshot of the displayed file.

Figure 2. HTML file from variant 1b[3] resources.

This image indicates that the author is planning to launch a phishing attack to club members.
However, no email functionality is used in the sample and the HTML file makes therefore not much
sense for now. The submission dates on virustotal indicate that the version 1a is an older and
version 1b is the newer version of the downloader. The addition of the HTML file reinforces this
assumption.

7.

Variant 2

Same as variant 1, there is also an old version[4] and a new version[5].
Both versions have a similar initial routine as in 2. Initial routine. The old version only uses the
C:\Users\USERNAME\Music path and downloads the data from
hxxp://173.249.39.7:1337/uploads/excutbls/ with the filename specified via socket.io from the
server.
The new version checks if the file hxxp://93.104.208.17:1337/uploads/excutbls/h/one/Player.exe
exists and then opens a socket connection. If the directory C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Audio Player
doesn’t exist, it will be created. If the file C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Audio Player\Audio.exe doesn’t
exist, an autostart key with the value “Audio Player” is created and the file copies itself to that
path.
After that it does the same routine again for a different path. It checks if the directory
C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Music Player exists. If it doesn’t, the directory will be created. If the file

5

G Data Whitepaper 2018 – paper 3: Description for SocketPlayer

C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Music Player\Music.exe doesn’t exist, it will create an autostart key with
the value “Music Player”. Next it will download the file
hxxp://93.104.208.17:1337/uploads/executbls/h/two/Music.exe and save it to the path
C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Music Player\Music.exe.
Lastly the machine name is sent twice, the username is also sent twice and the date is sent to the
c2.

8.

Procedure of the latest SocketPlayer infection routine

The downloader[6] creates a connection to the host hxxp://asdkajkjsdnaskjndjansdka.com. This
connection is made to detect sandboxed systems. Most sandboxed systems return true for any
DNS query. So if this connection “succeeds” the malware stops itself. If the check has passed, the
downloader downloads hxxp://93.104.208.17:5156/uploads/executbls/h/Audio.exe, decrypts that
executable with the hardcoded string “!##&aAwPs1337” and uses the Invoke method to run the
decrypted program[7] in memory.
The invoked program creates a socket connection to the host hxxp://93.104.208.17:5156/socket.io
and creates the registry key HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run “Audio
Player” with the command C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Audio.exe and copies itself to the commands
location. If the file C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Process Handler\Handler.exe exists, it
checks if the directory C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Process Handler exists. If the
directory doesn’t exist, it will be created. Furthermore, an autostart key with the value “Handler” to
the above executable path is created. It then downloads the file
hxxp://93.104.208.17:5156/uploads/excutbls/h/Bkdr.exe and saves it to the location above.
It also downloads and executes the file http://93.104.208.17:5156/uploads/excutbls/h/Cntrl.exe. The
Cntrl.exe[8] downloads Player.exe(SocketPlayer)[9], decrypts it[10] and runs the file in memory.

9.

Bkdr.exe

The file Bkdr.exe[11] (possibly means backdoor.exe) just downloads the file
hxxp://93.104.208.17:5156/uploads/excutbls/h/MAudio.exe[12], saves the file to the temporary
directory and executes it. The executed file downloads the file
hxxp://93.104.208.17:5156/uploads/excutbls/h/Audio.exe(Unfortunately no hash available at this
point), decrypts it with the hardcoded key “!##&aAwPs1337” and invokes it in memory. The
invoked file is similar to variant 2 of the SocketPlayer downloader.

10.

Changes to SocketPlayer

At the beginning of this report we had looked at the commands of the file[1]. With the latest
sample[10] some things changed which are listed below.



The c2 port has changed from 3000 to 7218
The file location changed from C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Player\Player.exe to
C:\Users\USERNAME\Music\Media Player\Player.exe

The information that is sent in the initial routine changed a bit. In the old version[1] the
author sends the string “,1.1,1” to the c2. In the new version the program sends “,1.2,1”,
telling the c2 that the new version runs on the machine.
To the commands Fdrive,fdir,smfdir,procs,prockil,gtscreen and kylgs the variable susrid is
added to be sent to the server. This is done to identify the infected systems better.
The functionality stscrnpercnt is added. This feature assists the gtscreen function to set the
quality of the image.
The gtscreen function additionally to the susrid also sends the computer name with the
picture.
The storage location of upldex is changed to
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Templates. An autostart key to the
registry is added. The downloaded file is also executed.
The kylgs function also switched to use the above path to read the file klsetup.txt.
The destt function additionally checks if the following path and files are available. If so, it
deletes them. C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Process Handler
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Process Handler\Handler.exe,
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Templates\Image.exe and
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Templates\Media.exe.

Spreading

It appears that the website https://bsf.[gov].in which is the border security force of India has been
used to spread malware including SocketPlayer downloader as you can see from figure 2 Below.
Currently the website does not seem to spread malware again.
