In our last three posts we introduced you to APT3 and identified two individuals responsible
for purchasing their domain names – Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao. An IP addresses in
Guangdong, China was associated with some of the domains.
Both individuals have a long history of purchasing APT3 infrastructure. Who do they work for
and where do their orders come from?
Boyusec
Well, the answers to those questions are reasonably easy to find. Wu Yingzhuo (吴颖卓) and
Dong Hao (董浩) are both shareholders in the same company.
This listing is for a Chinese cyber security firm called 博御信息 (or Boyusec – the Guangzhou
Boyu Information Technology Company, Ltd) that was licensed in December 2013 and is
based in Guangdong. It lists both 吴颖卓 and 董浩 as major shareholders.

The Ministry of State Security
On the 29th of November 2016, freebeacon.com reported that Pentagon intelligence officials
had identified Boyusec as being a contractor for the Chinese Ministry of State Security
(MSS). The MSS is one of China’s Intelligence Services and is an active player in their Cyber
programme.

The conclusion?
Either a Chinese InfoSec company called Boyusec, known to be involved with Chinese
Intelligence Cyber operations, has two shareholders with the same names as two apparant
APT3 actors, or Boyusec is APT3.
