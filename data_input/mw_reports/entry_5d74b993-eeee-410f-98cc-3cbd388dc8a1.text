In this blog post, we discuss the technical details of a new banking dropper that we have dubbed DawDropper, give a brief history of banking
trojans released in early 2022 that use malicious droppers, and elaborate on cybercriminal activities related to DaaS in the deep web.

By Trend Micro Mobile Team
Malicious actors have been surreptitiously adding a growing number of banking trojans to Google Play Store via malicious droppers this year,
proving that such a technique is effective in evading detection. Additionally, because there is a high demand for novel ways to distribute mobile
malware, several malicious actors claim that their droppers could help other cybercriminals disseminate their malware on Google Play Store,
resulting in a dropper-as-a-service (DaaS) model.
In the latter part of 2021, we found a malicious campaign that uses a new dropper variant that we have dubbed as DawDropper. Under the
guise of several Android apps such as Just In: Video Motion, Document Scanner Pro, Conquer Darkness, simpli Cleaner, and Unicc QR
Scanner, DawDropper uses Firebase Realtime Database, a third-party cloud service, to evade detection and dynamically obtain a payload
download address. It also hosts malicious payloads on GitHub. As of reporting, these malicious apps are no longer available on Google Play
Store.

We explore the technical details of the new DawDropper dropper, look at the brief history of banking trojans released in early 2022 that use
malicious droppers, and discuss cybercriminal activities related to DaaS in the deep web in this entry.

DawDropper technical analysis
Based on our observation, DawDropper has variants that drop four types of banking trojans, including Octo, Hydra, Ermac, and TeaBot. All
DawDropper variants use a Firebase Realtime Database, a legitimate cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing data, as their command-andcontrol (C&C) server and host malicious payloads on GitHub.

A similarity between Clast82 and DawDropper
Interestingly, we found that another dropper called Clast82, which was reported by CheckPoint Research in March 2021, also uses Firebase
Realtime Database as a C&C server.

The DawDropper C&C server returns data similar to Clast82 data:

The Octo payload
DawDropper’s malicious payload belongs to the Octo malware family, which is a modular and multistage malware that is capable of stealing
banking information, intercepting text messages, and hijacking infected devices. Octo is also known as Coper, and it has been historically used
to target Colombian online banking users.
Based on our analysis, DawDropper’s Octo malware payload is similar to previously reported variants. The package uses programming
language keywords to obfuscate malicious functionalities.

Figure 9. The same type of Octo payload packages deployed in March and June 2022

Once the Octo malware is successfully launched in the victim’s device and gains primary permissions, it will keep the device awake and
register a scheduled service to collect and upload sensitive data to its C&C server. It also uses virtual network computing (VNC) to record a
user's screen, including sensitive information such as banking credentials, email addresses and passwords, and PINs. The malware also
causes a user’s screen to turn black by turning the device’s backlight off and turns off the device’s sound to hide malicious behavior.

The malware can also disable Google Play Protect (which goes through a device’s apps and checks for malicious behavior) and collects user
data, including an infected mobile phone’s Android ID, contact list, installed apps, and even text messages.
A brief history of banking droppers in early 2022
To better understand this trend of banking trojans being distributed via malicious droppers, we must look back at how droppers have been
popping up on Google Play Store since the beginning of 2022, analyze how each of these droppers vary from one another and evolve, and
learn how cybercriminals are disseminating them.

Main differences among banking droppers
Although these banking droppers have the same main objective — to distribute and install malware on victims’ devices — we have observed
that there are marked differences in how these banking droppers implement their malicious routines. For example, the banking droppers that
were launched earlier this year have hard-coded payload download addresses. Meanwhile, the banking droppers that have been recently
launched tend to hide the actual payload download address, at times use third-party services as their C&C servers, and use third-party
services such as GitHub to host malicious payloads.

The Vultur dropper (SHA-256: 00a733c78f1b4d4f54cf06a0ea8cc33604512d6032ef4ef9114c89c700bfafcf), also known as Brunhilda was first
reported as a DaaS at the end of 2020. In January 2022, we observed that it directly downloads the malicious payload on the infected device
and has its own method to decrypt the malicious payload.

The Sharkbot dropper (SHA-256: 7f55dddcfad05403f71580ec2e5acafdc8c9555e72f724eb1f9e37bf09b8cc0c), which was also released in
January 2022, has a unique behavior: It not only acts as a dropper but also requests for accessibility permissions and responds with all of the
user interface (UI) events of the infected device.

Meanwhile, the TeaBot dropper, released in April 2022, uses GitHub to host its malware payload. However, TeaBot uses another GitHub
repository to get the download address, in contrast to DawDropper, which uses a Firebase Realtime Database.

DaaS dark web activities
In our investigation of banking trojans using droppers, we observed that one of the droppers that were first reported in 2021, Gymdrop, is
connected to a management panel (trackerpdfconnect[.]com and smartscreencaster[.]online) that cybercriminals can use to manage both the
dropper and the payload. We also found Gymdrop being advertised in a dark web forum as a typical DaaS.

Conclusion and security recommendations
Cybercriminals are constantly finding ways to evade detection and infect as many devices as possible. In a half-year span, we have seen how
banking trojans have evolved their technical routines to avoid being detected, such as hiding malicious payloads in droppers. As more banking
trojans are made available via DaaS, malicious actors will have an easier and more cost-effective way of distributing malware disguised as
legitimate apps. We foresee that this trend will continue and more banking trojans will be distributed on digital distribution services in the future.
To avoid falling prey to malicious apps, users should adopt the following security best practices:
Always check app reviews to see if users voice out unusual concerns or negative experiences.
Apply due diligence when looking into app developers and publishers. Avoid downloading apps from suspicious-looking websites.
Avoid installing apps from unknown sources.
Mobile users can help minimize the threats posed by these fraudulent apps by using Trend Micro Mobile Security Solutions to scan mobile
devices in real time and on demand to detect malicious apps or malware to block or delete them. These apps are available for both Android
and iOS.
