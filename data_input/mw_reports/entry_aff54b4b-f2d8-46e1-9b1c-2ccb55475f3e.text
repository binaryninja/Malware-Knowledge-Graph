Who’s Behind the RevCode WebMonitor RAT?
krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/whos-behind-the-revcode-webmonitor-rat/

The owner of a Swedish company behind a popular remote administration tool (RAT)
implicated in thousands of malware attacks shares the same name as a Swedish man who
pleaded guilty in 2015 to co-creating the Blackshades RAT, a similar product that was used
to infect more than half a million computers with malware, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.

At issue is a program called “WebMonitor,” which was designed to allow users to remotely
control a computer (or multiple machines) via a Web browser. The makers of WebMonitor, a
company in Sweden called “RevCode,” say their product is legal and legitimate software
“that helps firms and personal users handle the security of owned devices.”
But critics say WebMonitor is far more likely to be deployed on “pwned” devices, or those
that are surreptitiously hacked. The software is broadly classified as malware by most
antivirus companies, likely thanks to an advertised feature list that includes dumping the
remote computer’s temporary memory; retrieving passwords from dozens of email programs;
snarfing the target’s Wi-Fi credentials; and viewing the target’s Webcam.

In a writeup on WebMonitor published in April 2018, researchers from security firm Palo Alto
Networks noted that the product has been primarily advertised on underground hacking
forums, and that its developers promoted several qualities of the software likely to appeal to
cybercriminals looking to secretly compromise PCs.
For example, RevCode’s website touted the software’s compatibility with all “crypters,”
software that can encrypt, obfuscate and manipulate malware to make it harder to detect by
antivirus programs. Palo Alto also noted WebMonitor includes the option to suppress any
notification boxes that may pop up when the RAT is being installed on a computer.

RevCode maintains it is a legitimate company officially registered in Sweden that obeys all
applicable Swedish laws. A few hours of searching online turned up an interesting record at
Ratsit AB, a credit information service based in Sweden. That record indicates RevCode is
owned by 28-year-old Swedish resident Alex Yücel.
In February 2015, a then 24-year-old Alex Yücel pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to computer
hacking and to creating, marketing and selling Blackshades, a RAT that was used to
compromise and spy on hundreds of thousands of computers. Arrested in Moldova in 2013
as part of a large-scale, international takedown against Blackshades and hundreds of
customers, Yücel became the first person ever to be extradited from Moldova to the United
States.
Yücel was sentenced to 57 months in prison, but according to a record for Yücel at the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Prisons, he was released on Nov. 1, 2016. The first advertisements in
hacker forums for the sale of WebMonitor began in mid-2017. RevCode was registered as an
official Swedish company in 2018, according to Ratsit.
Until recently, RevCode published on its Web site a value added tax (VAT) number, an
identifier used in many European countries for value added tax purposes. That VAT number
— first noted by the blog Krabsonsecurity.com (which borrows heavily from this site’s design
and banner but otherwise bears no relation to KrebsOnSecurity.com) — has since been

removed from the RevCode Web site and from historic records at The Internet Archive. The
VAT number cited in that report is registered to Alex Yücel, and matches the number listed
for RevCode by Ratsit AB.
Yücel could not be immediately reached for comment. But an unnamed person responded to
an email sent to the customer support address listed at RevCode’s site. Presented with the
information and links referenced above, the person responding wrote, “nobody working
for/with RevCode is in any way related to BlackShades. Anything else suggesting otherwise
is nothing but rumors and attempts to degrade our company by means of defamation.”
The person responding from the RevCode support email address contended that the Alex
Yücel listed as owner of the company was not the same Alex Yücel convicted of co-authoring
Blackshades. However, unless the Ratsit record is completely wrong, this seems unlikely to
be true.
According to the Ratsit listing, the Alex Yücel who heads RevCode currently lives in a suburb
of Stockholm, Sweden with his parents Can and Rita Yücel. Both Can and Rita Yücel cosigned a letter (PDF) in June 2015 testifying to a New York federal court regarding their son’s
upstanding moral character prior to Yücel the younger’s sentencing for the Blackshades
conviction, according to court records.
