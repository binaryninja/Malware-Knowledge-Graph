Abstract—In the last three decades there have been significant
changes in the cybercrime world in terms of organization, type
of attacks, and tools. Remote Access Trojans (RAT) are an
intrinsic part of traditional cybercriminal activities but they
have become a standard tool in advanced espionage and scams
attacks. The overly specialized research in our community
on Remote Access Trojans has resulted in a seemingly lack
of general perspective and understanding on how RATs have
evolved as a phenomenon. This work presents a new generalist
perspective on Remote Access Trojans, an analysis of their
growth in the last 30 years, and a discussion on how they
have become a commodity in the last decade. We found that
the amount of RATs increased drastically in the last ten years
and that nowadays they have become standardized commodity
products that are no very different from each other.

1. Introduction
Remote access software is a type of computer program
that allows an individual to have full remote control of
the device where the software is installed. Remote Access
Tool refers to a type of remote access software used for
benign purposes, such as TeamViewer [1] or Ammyy Admin [2], which are common tools used by billions of users
worldwide. Remote Access Trojans (RAT) are a special type
of remote access software commonly used for malicious
purposes, where (i) the installation is done without user
consent, (ii) the remote control is done secretly, and (iii)
the program hides itself in the system to avoid detection.
The distinction between tools and trojans was created by
the information security industry to distinguish benign from
malicious RATs, however in the underground, attackers
claim all RATs are Remote Access Tools.
Early Remote Access Trojans were used for pranks and
for fun, to showcase skills, and to brag in hacking forums.
Developing your own RAT was an entry level skill that inexperienced users were somehow expected to rapidly acquire.
Websites like megasecurity.org were used to list and publish
new RATs, many of which were never developed further.
While the challenge of building highly functional RATs

remains to today, their use has evolved. In the last decade
more and more RATs were used in espionage, financial
and state sponsored attacks [3]–[5]. While many of them
had their source code leaked or open sourced, the market
for Fully Undetectable (FUD) RATs and special plugins
matured. Nowadays, RATs have become a commodity.
Despite the abundance of reports on individual RAT
families and attacks that use them [6], there is no previous
research that looks at RATs as a whole. The growth and
evolution of RATs appears to have escaped public attention
so far. The lack of a more generalist research hinders
the understanding and development of new techniques and
methods to better detect them.
This paper aims to start a discussion on RATs as a
unique phenomenon that requires further study. We argue
that in the last 10 years a shift has occurred in the threat
landscape where RATs have become a commodity. This
work analyzes the growth of Remote Access Trojans, describes their key technological elements, their functionality,
and analyzes how they propagate. Furthermore, this work
presents a timeline of the last 30 years of RATs evolution,
a detailed overview of the most well-known RATs during
2019-2020, and an analysis of how they have been commercialized.
The main question this research explores is, are Remote
Access Trojans a commodity in the underground? Answering this question, the contributions of this paper are:
•
•
•

The first and most comprehensive timeline of the
last 30 years of RATs.
An overview of the commoditization of the most
well-known RATs in 2019-2020.
A first analysis on the types of attacks and attackers
using RATs.

2. Methodology
To address the analysis of RATs we first searched and
methodologically analyzed a comprehensive list of Remote
Access Trojans since their first public appearance in 1996
until 2018. These RATs, shown in the timeline of Figure 1,
were found from public sources and inquiries with the
community, and are the base tools analyzed in this work.

The years 2019 and 2020 were not included in this research
as the information available for this time is at the moment
not comprehensive and incomplete.
We chose a small subset of RATs in order to study their
specific characteristics, their users and how they are commercialized. These RATs were selected using the following
methodology. First, we searched on well-known forums for
RATs that users were talking about or recommending to each
other in the period from January 2019 to March 2020. We
consulted HackForums [7], Sinister.ly [8], and Nulled [9].
Second, taking as an input the list of RATs created in the
previous step, we searched for those RATs in websites that
were selling hacking tools, software, and other goods. Third,
we limited the scope of RATs to those that were being sold
in two or more of the above mentioned marketplaces. Fourth,
we assembled the final list of RATs to study: WebMonitor
RAT, Android Voyager RAT, Remcos RAT, SpyNote RAT,
Luminosity Link RAT, Omni Android RAT, Ozone RAT,
Imminent Monitor RAT, NanoCore RAT, NetWire RAT and
CyberGate RAT. Fifth, further information was collected
from public intelligence sources such as blogs, news articles
and forums on each of the selected RAT.

3. Overview of Remote Access Trojans
In order to define a common ground to further the
understanding of RATs, we first introduce some of the key
technical elements of every Remote Access Trojan. Then
we present a timeline showing the growth of RATs over
the last 30 years. Finally we discuss common functionality
found among RATs.

3.1. Key Technical Elements
Remote Access Trojans have two key elements: client
and server. Additional RATs components include the
builder, plugins and crypter. A RAT server is the program
installed on the victim’s device. The server is configured to
connect back to the attacker. The client is the program used
by the attacker to monitor and control infected victims: it
allows the visualization of all active victims infections, displays general information about each infection, and allows
to manually perform individual actions on each victim.
The builder is a program that allows to create new
RAT servers with different configurations. When attackers
move infrastructure quickly, launch new attacks, and require
flexibility, builders save time and provide agility.
RATs come with certain fixed functionality. To add more
capabilities, some RATs rely on plugins. Not all RATs offer
this capability, however the most used ones do, and good
plugins are craved by the cybercrime community. These
plugins are one of the main differentiators in terms of cost
in the underground market.
To be more efficient and hard to detect, attackers use
crypters to make the RAT servers Fully Undetectable (FUD).
Crypters are programs that take a given program, read the
code, encrypt it with a key, and automatically create a new
program that contains the encrypted code and key to decrypt

it. Upon execution the key will be used to automatically
decrypt the original program. Crypters are used to avoid
detection by anti-virus engines.

3.2. Thirty Years Timeline of RATs
To better understand the growth and evolution of RATs,
it was necessary to investigate and build a corpus of the most
well-known Remote Access Trojans in history that had the
key technical elements described previously. We were able
to find, reference and document many RATs since 1996 to
2018 by looking at reports, code, and forums. These RATs
were also grouped in families, with slight variations of the
same RATs grouped together. The final list contains 337
unique families of RATs, registering the first time seen, or
date of the first public report about them.
The collected information was used to build the first and
most comprehensive timeline of RATs to date. The timeline
is illustrated in Figure 1, and it is divided in three phases
shown in the figure as different dotted lines. The first phase
is from 1990 to 1999; the second phase is from 2000 to
2009; and the third phase is from 2010 to 2018. In Figure 1
we also highlight in bold pink color the 11 RATs that will
be analyzed in more detail in the following sections.
The oldest RAT was first developed in 1996 [10], however legitimate Remote Access Tools were first created in
1989 [11]. Since then, the number of RATs has grown
rapidly. Figure 1 illustrates 337 of the most well-known RAT
families during 1996–2018. The first period, 1996-1999,
was marked by home-made RATs. In these years, everyone
made their own RAT, however these did not prosper nor
were heavily used. Among the most prominent ones were
Back Orifice, Sub7 and Netbus, which together defined a
generation by being innovative and disruptive. The second
period, 2000-2009, showed a slight growth of more mature
RATs, that were intended for fun but were started to be used
for attacks and profit. Among the highlights of this period
are Gh0st, PoisonIvy and DarkComet. The third period,
2010-2018, showed an important shift. RATs became a
commodity. The market matured, RAT sellers were expected
to provide support, new features, and in some cases even to
host part of the infrastructure.
The growth of RATs in the last decade depends on
a combination of multiple factors. The maturity of the
cybercrime ecosystem, the specialization of work in the
underground communities, and interdependence of threat
actors are some of the key factors that led to an increase
in the demand of new and better malicious software, and
RATs among them. To understand the real cause however,
a more extended analysis and study is needed.

3.3. Functionality
The server-side functionality offered by each RAT will
vary depending on the targeted platform and the intent for
which the RAT was created. There is not standardized set of
features among RATs, however certain features are expected,

Figure 1. Timeline of 337 well-known Remote Access Trojans families during 1996-2018, ordered by year of first seen or reported by the community.
The timeline is divided in three phases marked by dotted lines. The last phase clearly shows a significant growth compared with the previous phases. In
bold pink we highlight the 11 RATs this research focuses on.

•
•
•
•
•

•

Webcam: take screenshots or full video recording
through the victim’s webcam.
Microphone: access the microphone to record audio.
Display: take screenshots or full screen recording of
the victim’s desktop.
Keylogger: capture keystrokes from the victim.
System: perform system operations such as retrieving system information, file management, hard drive
and RAM access, installing programs, and other.
Peripherals: access to peripherals devices including
Bluetooth, CD/DVD reader, and others.

The quality of the RATs however does not only depend
on the server side functionality. On the client-side, the
following factors are considered important:
•
•
•
•
•

Stealthiness: the more stealth and hard to detect the
RAT is, the better.
Stability: server and client stability are paramount
qualities of a successful RAT.
Graphical interface: the more user friendly the client
control panel, the better.
Encryption: traffic encryption is very important to
hide the content in the network.
Dependencies: the fewer dependencies needed for a
RAT to work, the better.

3.4. Propagation Methods
The distribution and propagation of Remote Access Trojans rely heavily on social engineering. Social engineering
refers to the psychological manipulation of humans into
acting in a desired way, usually with the aim of obtaining
information or in this case, installing a malicious program.
Traditional phishing and spear phishing campaigns are
the preferred method to distribute RATs using malicious
attachments [12]–[15]. Some Facebook pages were also
known for luring users to install RATs [16]. These pages
contain links to download what looked like normal software,
which in reality would download RATs. Channels in secure
messengers such as Telegram and WhatsApp were also
known to spread malicious links that would lead to RATs
[17], [18].

4. Commoditization of RATs
Just like other types of malware, RATs are openly
commercialized. This section provides insights on eleven
selected RATs that were more recommended by users in
forums during 2019-2020. This section will focus on their
characteristics, special features, and provide insights of their
commercialization on different marketplaces.
Based on the analysis of the market it is possible to say
that far from being custom-made unique tools, RATs have
become a commodity. They have become a group of standardized products that are not very different from each other.
The variation of prices is not given by the functionality of
the RATs per se, but instead by the sellers themselves being

able to offer additional services, extended functionality or
technical support. No matter the skill level, attackers are
able to chose from a wide range of very affordable options
and adjust their attack to the final product selected. Most
RATs do not have a huge technological advantage, but better
reviews, recommendations and in the end, better marketing.

4.1. Overview of the Eleven Selected RATs
The selected RATs, as summarized in Table 1, are
WebMonitor RAT, Android Voyager RAT, Remcos RAT,
SpyNote RAT, Luminosity Link RAT, Omni Android
RAT, Ozone-RAT, Imminent Monitor RAT, NanoCore RAT,
NetWire RAT and CyberGate RAT. These RATs are also
highlighted on Figure 1 in bold pink color.
CyberGate RAT was first seen in 2011 [19]. The client is
written in Delphi, the server is believed to be written in C++
and is very lightweight, 40 KB uncompressed. It seems to
share part of its code with an earlier RAT known as Xtreme
RAT from 2010, whose source code was leaked [20]. This
RAT targets specifically Windows machines, both 32Bit and
64Bit. Its key functionalities include keylogger, screenshot
logger, password recovery and microphone capture.
NetWire RAT was first seen in 2012 [21] and is multiplatform, being able to target not only Windows machines,
but also Mac, Linux and Android. Both client and server
are written in C. It offers full remote access with traditional
functionalities such as keylogger, system management, password recovery and others. It allows heavy customization.
Imminent Monitor RAT, also known as IM-RAT, was
first seen in 2012 [22]. It targets Windows machines, and
both client and server are written in .NET. Imminent Monitor was commercialized as a benign administration tool,
however researchers confirmed that some of its functionalities made the RAT undetectable for the victim, including
recording from the webcam undetected by turning off the
webcam light [23]. A version of Imminent Monitor allowed
attackers to run a cryptocurrency miner on the infected
machine.
NanoCore RAT was first publicly seen in 2013, while
its author started coding it on late 2012 [24]. Bot client and
server are written in .NET. The source code of NanoCore
has been leaked multiple times, and while the original
author was arrested there are versions of it still being sold
today. NanoCore was reported to be used for state-sponsored
attacks [3]. Among its features it offers a plugin system to
extend its functionality, remote chat, and uPnP support.
Luminosity Link was first seen in 2015 [25], targets
Windows machines and both client and server are written in
.NET. The source code was leaked, however it is still being
sold even though the author was arrested [26].
Omni Android RAT, also known as OmniRAT, was first
seen in 2015 [27]. This RAT is multi-platform, allowing
to target Windows, Mac, Linux and Android victims. For
Android devices it allows to retrieve a high number of information, including battery level, widgets installed, Bluetooth,
calls, and many others.

Ozone-RAT was created in 2015 [28]. Both client and
server are written in C++, and it targets specifically Windows machines. It offers traditional functionalities such as
remote desktop, keylogger and system management. One of
the main highlights of this RAT is that it offers a hidden
VNC functionality.
Remcos RAT was first seen in 2016 [29]. Both client
and server are written in C++ making it lightweight. Remcos
targets 32Bit and 64Bit Windows machines. Its functionality
includes uploading and downloading files, system management, and keylogger. There are several variants observed in
the wild, which suggest that the source code may have been
leaked.
SpyNote RAT version 2 was first seen in 2016 [30],
however it may have been created earlier. The client is
written in Visual Basic, and the server in Java. It targets
Android devices. Among its functionality it includes the
ability to access contacts, listen to calls, access front and
back cameras, read SMS, and system management without
requiring root access. The builder of SpyNote was leaked
[31] and thus, multiple versions have been observed of this
RAT.
Android Voyager RAT, also known as Voyager RAT, was
first seen in 2017 [32]. Both client and server are written in
Java, and its author claims to be original and not based
from other leaked RAT. It targets Android devices. The
functionality offered depends on whether there is root access
on the device or not. Among the novel features, it claims that
with root access it can survive factory reset on the Android
device.
WebMonitor RAT was first seen in 2017 [33]. Both
client and server are written in C++. WebMonitor targets
Windows, Linux, Mac and Google OS. It’s designed to be an
enterprise class RAT able to compete with TeamViewer and
other commercial remote access software. It offers stability,
full remote control, and the management of clients through
a web page being multi-platform on the client side as well.
4.1.1. RAT Features. In terms of functionality, all the
selected RATs provide the same basic features as described
in Section 3.3. These features however are complemented
by additional features that characterize and differentiate
RATs among each other. However until today, there is not a

common standardization of features to compare RATs. For
instance, for the CyberGate RAT we could find more than 70
individual features [34], while for NetWire the user manual
only lists a few dozen [35]. While at first sight CyberGate
seems to have more features, that is not the case. The only
difference is that the features described for CyberGate are
more detailed than those for NetWire, making a comparison
a difficult task.

4.2. Marketplaces
Just like other malware, RATs are openly commercialized through forums and marketplaces. In this paper we focus on six marketplaces selling RATs among other hacking
tools and services. The selected marketplaces are shown on
Table 2, along with a summary of the RATs offered in each
market and their prices.
Although the majority of well-known RATs are opensource or had their code leaked, sellers commercialize RAT
packages. These include the fully undetectable RAT with
plugins and its builder. Sellers may sell the RAT once, or
may offer subscriptions for a limited time. Subscriptions are
sold in tiers, such as Basic, Premium and Pro, or Startup,
Small Business and Enterprise. When sold via subscriptions,
the offerings vary according to the number of simultaneous
clients, functionality, number of plugins included, and concurrent tasks executed.
DaVinciCoders (codevinci.pw) is a website that sells
Microsoft Office exploits, crypters, keyloggers, RATs and
botnets. It has four RATs for sale: Imminent Monitor,
NanoCore, Luminosity Link, and Ozone RAT. It offers
plugins and support. This market sells the RAT, without
licensing, thus having lower prices than other markets. The
payment is handled via rocketr.net, however at the time of
writing, the site has banned the products due to violations
of their terms of services.
Secret Hacker Society (secrethackersociety.com) is
a website that sells exploits, botnets, RATs, keyloggers,
crypters, tutorials and hardware devices. It has nine RATs
for sale with prices ranging from 55 USD to 200 USD.
Some RATs are offered through licensing and special FUD
features, leading to higher prices than other markets. Payments are handled via perfectmoney.is or Bitcoin.

Buy All Rat (buyallrat588.com) is a website that sells
hacking software, RATs, Exploits, Spoofers, Private Mailers,
SMTP, Bot Nets, crypters, Shells, VPNs, keyloggers and
other. It has five RATs on sale on two tiers: Basic and Pro.
Pro licenses are more expensive as their include typically
lifetime access, technical support, one week money back
guarantee, and more than one device licensing. The seller
doesn’t perform direct sales, customers need to send an
email request and all exchange is done privately.
Dorian Docs (doriandocs.com) is a website that sells
accounts, RATs, fake IDs and fake documents. It has four
RATs on sale and each RAT has a different tier: single price,
Business/Professional, Startup/Small Business/Business, 1
month/3 months/6 months/Lifetime. Payments are made
with cryptocurrency, accepting Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum
and Litecoin.
FUD Exploits (fudexploits.com) is a website that sells
botnets, crypters, passports, RATs, and other products. It has
ten RATs on sale, and it offers different RAT packages at
different prices, varying on versions, number of plugins, and
support. Payments are made using Bitcoin.
Ultra Hacks (ultrahacks.org) is a website that sells
tutorials, RATs, botnets, hardware, and services. It has five
RATs on sale, only two of them are offered in two tiers
Professional/Premium, the rest is offered in a single option.
The seller accepts payments in Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin,
direct by transfer SEPA, cash on delivery and Perfect Money.
The variation in price depends on the how fully undetectable the RAT is and on the type of license purchased, if
any. In terms of detection, a RAT can be detectable, fully
undetectable at runtime, fully undetectable at scan time (AV
scans), or both. The price will also depend on the type of
license. Markets such as DaVinciCoders sell just the RAT
without any type of license, leading to lower prices. Markets
such as FUD Exploits sell the license to use the RAT for a
number of devices, typically 1 device. Licenses can be for
a finite time, or infinite, leading also to higher prices.

sectors or type of crimes they focus on. In contrast with
botnets, RATs are precision tools that excel in targeted
attacks meant to extract specific information from victims.
RAT attacks differ from most malware attacks in several
aspects. First, contrary to botnets where an attacker controls
all the bots simultaneously, attackers control each RAT
infection manually. Second, due to this individual control
of each victim, the sequence of actions on the victims may
never be the same in two infections. Third, the number
of simultaneous infections that an attacker can control are
limited by the skill of the attacker. No attacker will be able
to control half a million victims as with botnets.

5.1. Business Email Compromise
Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of scam
directed at companies or organizations that pay their suppliers via wire transfers [36]. In BEC attacks, attackers use
different techniques with the aim of redirecting the transfer
of funds to attackers’ accounts instead of the legitimate ones,
thus stealing the money. While traditionally information
stealers were the preferred tool in BEC attacks, there has
been a shift and nowadays the use of RATs is becoming the
norm [37].

5.2. Espionage
RATs are designed for spying on victims, and cyber
espionage is the type of attack where they excel at. Cyber
espionage attackers may develop their own RATs [38],
[39], or use well-known commercial RATs for their operations. Advanced attackers, like the Tonto APT group,
has been known to use the same self-developed RAT for
over a decade [40]. There are pros and cons of using wellknown RATs for a highly confidential operation. Using wellknown RATs may leave unnecessary tracks that could lead
to identify the attacker, and the RAT may not have all the
needed functionality. Additionally, commercially available
RATs may not provide enough stability or the stealthiness
required for cyber espionage activities. However, developing
a custom-made RAT can clearly help identify the attacking
group very easily and help in attribution.

5.3. Targeted Attacks

7. Conclusion

Targeted attacks are attacks that are carefully planned,
target a very narrow set of victims, and have often a
specific goal. RATs are widely used in this type of
attacks. From the eleven RATs mentioned in the previous section, 9 of them were used in targeted attacks [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]. The
majority of the reports on RATs used on targeted attacks
focus on the delivery method and not on how the malware
was used. It is generally understood that RATs are mainly
used to monitor the infected device, steal documents, and
steal credentials that can be used to move laterally on the
compromised organization.

We have presented a first overview of the growth of
Remote Access Trojans by visualizing the 337 most wellknown families during 1996-2018. This generalist overview
provides an understanding of how this type of malicious
software has grown over the last three decades. Insights
on eleven of the most prominent RATs during 2019-2020
regarding their commercialization in online marketplaces
showed that RATs are technologically not so different from
each other. The main differences are in prices due to the
added features or additional services offered by the sellers
themselves. While it is still believed that real hackers will
create their own RAT, business oriented cybercriminals will
look for stability, simplicity, support, and guarantee; thus
buying RATs instead of crafting their own. These commercial characteristics of RATs mark them as a commodity.
Shifts in cybercriminal activities continue to happen and
RATs are used more and more in all type of attacks. Their
continual growth challenges current detection methods and
asks for further research that focuses on RATs as a general
malware class and not only in individual RAT families.

6. Characterizing Attackers
RAT users are not homogeneous. They can be separated in three groups according to their aim: (i) users
that use RATs for educational purposes, fun or pranks, (ii)
for advanced attacks and espionage activities, and (iii) for
cybercrime (whether selling RATs to other actors or buying
RATs for attacking).

6.1. Educational Purposes
Attackers using RATs for educational purposes, fun or
pranks rarely purchase commercial RATs. They will likely
write their own or modify existing ones. The renowned
development platform GitHub [50] contains dozens or hundreds self-made RATs created and shared publicly with
the disclaimer of being for education purposes only. In
underground forums, the hacker community still believes
that real hackers will create their own RAT, which incentives
this activity.

6.2. Advanced Attacks
State sponsored attackers and cyber crime organizations
are believed to create their own tools customized to their
own needs. An exemplary case in this category is the Tonto
APT Group that developed their own RAT and used it for
more than a decade [40]. The use of open source tools
however may be useful in some scenarios to give false flags
or as a distraction.

Acknowledgment
The authors would like to thank the Czech Technical
University for its support. The authors would also like to
thank all the individual researchers that shared information
and helped during the last three years in building the RAT
timeline.

6.3. Cybercrime
Traditional cybercrime groups are the ones engaged in
commercializing RATs. Sellers will use available RATs,
modify or enhance them, package them and sell them. They
will offer technical support, tutorials, and hosting services.
Buyers do not want to get absorbed in technical details and
programming, they look to focus on the attacks. Buyers rely
on sellers to provide stable tools, with support, and ability
to develop further modules for them in case they need them.
