Today’s security defenders are faced with a continuously evolving battleground. The number
of security vulnerabilities uncovered annually has grown every year for the past four years.
Moreover, adversaries’ ability to rapidly weaponize these vulnerabilities continues to
improve.
In particular, vulnerabilities affecting ubiquitous software, such as productivity applications
and collaboration software, are likely to be met with a rapid response from adversaries eager
to exploit the vulnerabilities during a short window of opportunity.
With the announcement of vulnerabilities — like the latest affecting Confluence collaboration
software — the clock is ticking for vendors to issue software updates, for customers to patch
the impacted software, and for defenders to quickly identify and close the window of
opportunity. And threat hunting — usually the last line of defense — becomes the first line of
defense in the face of novel threats and zero-day exploitation.

Falcon OverWatch Defends Against New Confluence Vulnerability
1/4

On Aug. 25, 2021, Atlassian — the makers of Confluence — published a security advisory
about a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2021-26084. Immediately,
CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ threat hunters began investigating for indications that this
threat was impacting customers. By Aug. 28, 2021, threat hunters found evidence that this
Confluence vulnerability was weaponized and being actively exploited by known threat
actors.
The speed with which threat actors were able to operationalize this particular exploit for
targeted outcomes was unsurprising, especially considering the potential threat this
vulnerability raised. Beginning on Sept. 1, 2021, OverWatch observed a substantial increase
in the compromise of vulnerable Linux-based Confluence servers that were exploited by
opportunistic actors.
Shortly after observing the uptick in Linux server compromises, OverWatch observed the
rapid shift to Windows-based servers, broadening the reach of the exploitation. The
observed increase in active exploitation against unrelated industry verticals signaled to
OverWatch a shift from targeted intrusion activity to more opportunistic eCrime activity.
OverWatch was able to identify the early stages of this vulnerability being exploited by
tracking malicious behaviors including decoding and execution of scripts, a mechanism to
evade known technology-based defenses. Over subsequent days, OverWatch saw multiple
opportunistic actors exploit the vulnerability to place webshells for persistence by writing and
decoding a Base64-encoded string to a file in the confluence directory. Once the
vulnerability was operationalized and widely understood, OverWatch quickly observed
multiple adversaries adopt this exploit to gain initial access, then later deploy tools like
Cobalt Strike, additional webshells to attempt to achieve persistence, and commodity coin
miners and commodity malware.

By this time, though, OverWatch was already ahead, having proactively worked to develop
behavioral-based preventions, as well as update and strengthen existing preventions, to
reduce the efficacy of eCrime threat actors against their intended targets.
Timeline of Events
AUG 25: Confluence Security Advisory and patch released.
AUG 28: Targeted intrusion attempts observed against a small number of customers. The
threat actor performed hands-on-keyboard operations consistent with data exfiltration
objectives.
AUG 29: OverWatch, working with the CrowdStrike Intelligence team, developed
behavioral-based preventions and increased visibility of indicators of attack (IOAs) and
indicators of compromise (IOCs).
AUG 31: Exploit code released, weaponized and widely made public
SEPT 1: OverWatch observed a steady increase in attempted Linux-based exploitation.
Several hours later, OverWatch observed a significant increase in attempted exploitation
consistent with cryptojacking objectives.
Windows systems become targets of the vulnerability, and OverWatch detected an uptick
in attempted cryptojacking activity on vulnerable hosts.
SEPT 2 TO PRESENT: eCrime threat actors continue to use scripting or automation to
search for and exploit vulnerable systems.

OverWatch has a rich bank of highly curated hunting leads based on a deep understanding
of adversary behaviors and motivations, intelligence-derived insights, and statistical analysis.
The speed and precision with which OverWatch can identify malicious activity allow threat
hunters to rapidly notify customers of potential hands-on-keyboard activity, allowing them to
“close the window of opportunity” for threat actors to be successful.

How You Can Protect Your Organization
The speed with which threat actors were able to weaponize the Confluence vulnerability is a
reminder that threat actors are extremely active and highly motivated in their attempts to gain
access into networks. OverWatch threat hunters suggest the following to harden your cyber
defenses against such exploitation:

3/4

Patch vulnerable systems quickly. Patching is the best defense against exploitation.
Of the Confluence exploitation activity observed by OverWatch, 97% of attempts at
exploitation occurred seven days or more after the patch was released, underscoring
the importance of timely patching. To ensure unpatched customers were not left
exposed, CrowdStrike released preventions to the CrowdStrike FalconⓇ console to
block malicious activity. However, the most effective course of action is still for an
organization to patch their own applications quickly. Instituting a process through which
systems are regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities and patched shortens the
window in which your organization can be compromised.
Employ threat hunting to find what autonomous defenses can miss. No
technology is 100% effective at blocking determined intruders.This is especially true for
zero-day exploits or novel tradecraft. Expert threat hunters complement and augment
technology-based defenses by continuously hunting for known malicious behaviors to
detect and disrupt intrusions at whatever hour of day they may strike.
