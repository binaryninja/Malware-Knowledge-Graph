• Key quotes:
• “- The target would get suspicious. What do you need to control?“
“- I need to turn on this functionality”
“- No-no-no, we are not rooting or jailbreaking. If you don’t root or jailbreak
you cannot go any deeper, you cannot turn on or off…”
“- Мы не джэйлбрэйкаем это дело.” (1st RU speaker: “We aren’t jailbreaking
this.”)
“- Поэтому мы не можем [сообщения вывезти].” (2nd RU speaker: “That’s
why we cannot extract the messages.”)
“- We can do only if we use 0 days.”

52

• Key quote:
• “- Actually, we are using Google. Everyone does Google, [no one test the
apps]”
“- This is why we like this solution”
“- Even Anti-Virus wouldn’t get it if it’s from the Google App Play store – it will
bypass”
“- All these years we always wanted to go into the market of phone
penetration, but it always was based on Trojan horses and we didn’t want to
be in this boat until we found this solution, so we integrated it, because this is
something....”

53

MISC
