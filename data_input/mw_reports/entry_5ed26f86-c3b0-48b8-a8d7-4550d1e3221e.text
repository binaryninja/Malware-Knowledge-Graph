Duqu– Threat Research and Analysis
McAfee Labs
Peter Szor
Sr. Director of Research

Agenda
• Stuxnet Overvieew
• Duqu Review-Current Intelligence, comparisons with Stuxnet,
• Best Practice recommendations
• Q&A

High Level Overview
• The executables share injection code with the Stuxnet worm and they
were compiled after the last Stuxnet sample was recovered.
• The structure of Duqu is very similar to Stuxnet (uses of PE resources)
• There is no ICS specific attack code in Duqu.
• The primary infection vector for Duqu deployment has not yet been
discovered/recovered (Duqu does not self-replicate or spread on its
own)
• The infected organizations appear to be limited
• No known targeting of energy sector companies.
• The malware employed a valid digital certificate (revoked as of 14
OCT 2011)
• The malware is designed to self-delete after 36 days
• The known Command and Control server was hosted in India.

The First Industrial Control System Attack

4

A brief history of Control System
Attacks
• DOS/Boot viruses change BIOS password
settings, battery needs to be removed
• CIH virus overwrites flash-ROM, motherboard
needs replacement
• Worms got faster than update and patch
deployment, targeting vulnerabilities, often
zero-Days
• Worms caused major DoS attacks
(… Nuclear Power plants’ safety monitoring
system was disabled by Slammer)
• Blaster worm is a contributor to a major
blackout
• Stuxnet combines 4 zero-day vulnerabilities
with ICS knowledge to target an industrial
process
• US Predator Drone Center gets infected with
malware
• Duqu (by Stuxnet team) is used for targeted
attacks in (UK, IRAN, US)

Stuxnet worm developed from November 2007
Exploits “Zero Days” vulnerabilities
- MS10-046 (LNK Vulnerability – Used by Zlob in 2008)
- MS08-067 (Server Service)
- MS10-061 (Print Spooler – Hackin9 magazine 2009)
- MS10-073 (Kbd Privilege Escalation)
- WinCC DBMS Password (hardcoded)
+ Stolen certificates (Realtek, JMicron)
+ ROP techniques in Exploits
Infection
- USB, Local Network, Siemens Step7/MC7
- Network Infection
- C&C operation (Weak! Mypremierfutbol.com, todaysfutbol.com)
- Anti Behavioral Blocking, avoids anti-virus detection
- Rootkit:
- User mode hooks to hide files from Explorer – Total\Windows Commander(!)
- User mode DLL replacement for Step7 (PLC Rootkit)
- s7otbxdl.dll forwards to s7otbxsx.dll (except for 16 functions related to
block Read/Write)
6
- Filter driver to hide USB content

USB User Mode Rootkit: Hooks APIs, than Sends F5 (Refresh) also
Deactivates/Reactivates Total Commander (and “Windows Commander”)

The Target: - PLC CPUs 6ES7-417, 6ES7-315-2
At least 33 Frequency Converters, Operating between 807Hz and
1,210Hz.

Cascaded Centrifuges

September, October 2011: Duqu
• Targeted attacks have been observed in Iran, England and US
• Other reports: Austria, Hungary, Indonesia
• C&C Server in India

10

Duqu and Stuxnet
• Several similarities have been observed at the code level which led us
to believe Duqu was based on the same source code as Stuxnet
Feature

Duqu Main Module
•
•
•
•
•

The two variants of .SYS files are responsible for restarting the malware
.SYS filenames mimic Jmicron and C-Media driver file names
Jmicron mimic file is not signed, and it is the earlier variant
Drivers are loaded at time of “Network group load”
They decrypt the PNF files and inject the resulting DLL into Services.exe, etc
• Anti-firewall feature, Anti-BB feature
• This DLL is responsible for decrypting the payload module from its resource
section. The resource Id is the same for all modules: 302
• The payload module is directly injected into running processes using the
same method as Stuxnet
• The DLL implement rootkit methods to hide this payload from user’s view

15

Duqu Keylogger
The Keylogger component is a standalone module. It was delivered via C&C
Server to target after the initial infection.
It uses the same decryption routines as the other modules. It is capable of
collecting different types of information from the target machine:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Keystroke data
Machine information (OS version, patches, machine name, users, etc)
Process list
Network information
List shared folders
List machines on the same network
Screen shots

The Keylogger accepts command line parameter commands, and only works if
the parameter “xxx” is the first parameter passed

data

Duqu Network Activities
Once the DLL module is started, the known variants will try to contact
the command and control server at the address below on tcp ports 80
and 443 (http/https)
• 206.183.111.97 (India)
The request may look like the one below:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Cookie: PHPSESSID=o5ukre1ul0q6i2il1ij3ghi0j1
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US;
rv:1.9.2.9) Gecko/20100824 Firefox/3.6.9 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Host: x.x.x.x

The PHPSESSID is an encrypted message sent to the command and
control server.
The User-Agent is hardcoded and may be used to identify machines
18 infected with this malware.
