Discovering some random folder with numbers and letters you don’t remember on your
website would make any website owner put on their detective cap. At first, you may think,
“Did I leave my FTP client open and my cat ran across the keyboard?”
But when you open the folder, you find a series of HTML files, each named with some kind of
nonsensical phrases like “cheap-cool-hairstyles-photos.html.” If you open one of these files
on the browser, you’ll likely be redirected to something you’re not expecting, such as a
suspicious ecommerce site or an error page.
These are signs that your website was hit with a gibberish hack. Removing this hack is not
just as easy as deleting a random folder. Even though it just seems like the hackers are
putting a bunch of nonsense on your site as a defacement, these attacks are far more
nefarious than you’d expect. It works similar to the Japanese keyword hack we covered on
the blog earlier this month.

Random folder on a website
Hackers put random folders on websites to conceal pages with URLs that will look appealing
in search results. Attackers sometimes store these URLs in folders with random numbers
and letters. This is in the hope that less savvy website owners will assume that they are CMS
core files.

The goal of a gibberish hack is to use a legitimate website’s good standing with Google’s
search engine to generate traffic to another website. In the example from Google below, we
see some of the examples like “cheap-hair-styles-cool.html” and “free-pictures-fun.html.”

Hackers will make money by sending traffic to their sites, so they want to keep the hack
going as long as possible. They will do this through cloaking – or hiding the content on your
site in a way that is hidden from you, but is visible to your visitors. There are many different
methods of cloaking. A basic cloaking techniques include formatting text to blend into the
background color. A more sophisticated method involves injected code that displays one
page when a search engine indexes the page, and a different page for a human visitor.
These methods can also be targeted in order to keep the malicious code secret from the
website owner. In this case, a gibberish page may display 404 error when the owner opens
it, but redirect any visitors from a different IP address, location, or device.
If you are at all concerned about whether a random folder on your website is caused by a
gibberish hack, you can use a free scanning tool like Sucuri’s SiteCheck to scan your site.
Alternatively, you can search your domain in Google with the site: yourwebsiteurl. However,
you will have to manually check for any suspicious URLs and content if Google hasn’t
flagged your website yet.

How to remove folders with random numbers and letters

2/5

To clean up a gibberish hack, you may think it’s as simple as just deleting the random folder
with numbers and letters and any HTML files created by the hackers. Unfortunately, it is likely
the hackers left an option to reinfect your website with more spammy content. As a result,
you will want to make sure your site is completely clean by following these steps.

Check Core File Integrity
The core files of your CMS are vital to making your website run, so they should never be
modified or removed. But hackers can make changes to these files, so you’ll need to make
sure they haven’t been tampered with. If you’re using WordPress, the Sucuri plugin is the
quickest way to check your core files integrity.
For users of other CMS platforms, you can use the diff command in the terminal. If using the
command line makes you nervous, you can check directories for recently modified files in
your FTP client. Just make sure to use FTPS, SFTP, or SSH and not unencrypted FTP to
keep that communication channel with your website secure. If you identify any core files that
have been compromised, replace them with a fresh copy or a clean backup.

Clean Hacked Files and Database Tables
If you have a recent backup that’s not infected, you’re in luck! You can just replace any
hacked website files with fresh copies from the backup. If you do not have a backup, you’ll
need to manually edit malicious code from your website. It’s important to make a backup of
the site before doing this, as removing code can cause your website to stop functioning
entirely. Make sure to test and verify the site is still operational after making any changes to
code.
You will also need to clean your database tables. The functions are used by plugins and
extensions for legitimate reasons, but hackers can also take advantage of them. To do this
yourself, it will require some manual searching and removal of suspicious content in your
website’s database. Again, make sure to do your backups before attempting.

Deal with the aftermath
After your website has been scrubbed, you’ll have to deal with the aftermath, including your
site’s standing on Google’s search results page. All those gibberish pages are still in
Google’s index. When users click those links, they will hit a “404 Not Found” error page,
which can damage SEO for the site. There are multiple solutions to resolving this problem
including the URL removal tool in Google and editing the robots.txt file on your server.
If you’re feeling worried about breaking your website while trying to clean a gibberish hack,
you may want to seek assistance from a website security professional.

Protect your website from the gibberish hack
3/5

Once you’ve cleaned up a gibberish hack, the last thing you’ll want to do is go through it all
again. That’s why it’s a good idea to protect and secure your website to prevent hackers from
gaining access. While it’s impossible to guarantee hackers won’t find a way in, these best
practices will be helpful in keeping your site away from bad actors.
Update everything – When website software is updated – whether it be for the CMS,
plugins, or themes – developers also patch vital security issues. Without these patches,
your website will be vulnerable to attacks. Because most attacks are automated by
bots that scan for any opportunities to exploit website vulnerabilities, it is important to
update your software as soon as possible. If you need to use outdated software on
your website for any reason, consider using a firewall option that allows for virtual
patching of outdated software to ensure that those vulnerabilities are covered even
without you updating the software.
Use strong passwords – Don’t reuse passwords on multiple accounts and make sure
they are long and unique. Avoid using any distinguishable words, too. A good rule of
thumb is that if you can say your password out loud, it can likely be compromised by
hackers. If you’re not using a password manager, get one. These services will both
generate strong passwords and keep track of them. Some popular choices include
LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password.
One site per server or hosting account – Hosting many websites on a single account
with your hosting provider seems like a great idea from a financial standpoint, but it’s
terrible for website security. Hosting many sites in the same location creates a large
attack surface that will allow for cross-site contamination.
Principle of Least Privilege – Your website users may be targeted by an attacker. As
a result, you’ll want to make sure to limit any administrator access and practice the
principle of least privilege. This means only giving users a minimal set of privileges in
order to perform an action and only granting them for the time required to complete
their job.
Make frequent backups – Backups are crucial for recovering a website after it has
been compromised. Make sure your backups are stored off site, as you do not want
hackers to be able to access and modify them in the event of an attack. Also, make
sure you can set up automatic backups and create multiple backups for redundancy.
Get a website firewall – All of these steps are helpful, but a fully robust website
security plan will include a web application firewall (WAF) to stop website hacks and
attacks. The Sucuri cloud-based WAF can instantly block attacks, while also providing
virtual patching, protection from zero-day exploits, and faster load times through our
CDN.

Conclusion
Finding a random folder on your website full of gibberish links is a nuisance that no website
owner wants to deal with. But you’ll want to get a gibberish hack cleaned up as soon as
possible.
4/5

Leaving a compromised website online for an extended period of time will lead to a loss of
visitor trust and search engine blacklisting that can destroy your website’s good standing. If
