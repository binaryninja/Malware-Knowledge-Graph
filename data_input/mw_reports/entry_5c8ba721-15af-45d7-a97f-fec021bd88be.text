From the Front Lines | Another Rebrand? Mindware and
SFile Ransomware Technical Breakdown
sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-another-rebrand-mindware-and-sfile-ransomware-technical-breakdown/
June 6, 2022

Researchers have recently noted the emergence of a new ransomware operator calling itself
‘Mindware’. The gang is thought to be responsible for a number of attacks beginning around
March to April 2022, with suggestions that the malware was used to attack a not-for-profit
mental health provider. Aside from targeting organizations in the Healthcare sector,
Mindware has posted data on its leaks site belonging to organizations in sectors such as
Finance, Engineering and Manufacturing. Mindware has a number of overlaps with an earlier
ransomware strain known as SFile (aka SFile2, Escal). In this post, we review how Mindware
differs from other ransomware families, note its similarities to SFile, and provide technical
indicators to aid threat hunters and detection teams.

Overview
According to one source, the Mindware gang first became active in March 2022. By April, the
group was practicing double extortion and operating its own leaks site. Mindware received
further attention in April when it was noted by a different researcher to have attacked a
mental health provider.
Mindware samples use a distinctive Reflective DLL injection technique. This, along with other
indicators described below, show strong overlaps with SFile ransomware samples. Although
we do not yet have specifics as to how Mindware attacks are initiated, SFile is known to use
RDP bruteforce as an entry vector into an organization.
Each Mindware payload is configured for a specific target. Upon infection and successful
execution, the payload drops a hardcoded ransomware note containing a combination of
instructions and threats.

Mindware ransom note
In common with a move made by other ransomware groups recently, Mindware attempts to
discourage victims from contacting ‘recovery companies’, negotiators or authorities,
threatening to immediately leak data should they do so. Victims are provided with a .onion
URL as a means to make contact with the attackers and to decrypt two “random files” as
proof that the operators possess a decryption key. Victims that refuse to pay are listed on the
Mindware ransomware public leaks site.

Mindware Technical Analysis
As noted above, Mindware uses Reflective DLL Injection, a technique in which the shellcode
dynamically retrieves handles to key API functions like LoadLibraryA() and GetProcAddress()
by locating function addresses through the Export Address Table loaded by the host process.
This allows the shellcode to be position-independent by building its own import table and
parsing through when executed in memory. This means a PE file could be loaded in the form
of shellcode or a DLL entirely from memory.
The technique, which has also been noted in other ransomware families such as
BlackMatter, avoids searching for module names directly and instead checks for hashes
precalculated with a ROT13 algorithm.
Mindware and SFile samples require kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll. The APIs are searched for
using a combination of the PEB (Process Environment Block) of the module and the EAT
(Export Address Table) and enumerating all function names.

ROT13 Algorithm
As noted, the same technique is characteristic of SFile ransomware samples, first seen in
2020 and active through 2021. Interestingly, SFile attacks seem to have been on hiatus over
the last 9 months or so, and the emergence of Mindware samples with strong overlaps is
indicative, as other researchers have noted, of a possible rebrand.
Both SFile and Mindware ransomware payloads accept the following parameters:
--enable-shares -> encrypt network shares
--kill-susp -> Triggers process termination

The ransomware checks for and then encrypts internal, removable and remote drive types.

Mindware and SFile payloads check for different drive types
Over 200 file types are targeted for encryption, denoted by a hardcoded list of file
extensions. However, the following files are specifically excluded from encryption:

autorun.inf
desktop.ini
ntuser.ini
boot.ini
iconcache.db
thumbs.db
bootfont.bin
ntuser.dat
bootmgr

Similarly, files in the following locations are also excluded from encryption:

In order to protect itself and prevent other running processes from interfering with the
encryption process, Mindware kills all other processes, with the exception of the following:
explorer.exe

powershell.exe

rundll32.exe

vmnetdhcp.exe

vmware-authd.exe

vmware-hostd.exe

vmware-tray.exe

vmware-usbarbitrator.exe

webroot_updater.exe

werfault.exe

windowsupdate.exe

List of processes that Mindware and SFile allow to run
SFile and Mindware samples are PEs typically around 250-300KB in size.

SFile and Mindware Ransomware Targeting
Analysis of the SFile payloads shows that SFile ransomware was mostly used against U.S
organizations in Manufacturing, Mechanical, and Automobile sectors.

How To Protect Against Mindware and SFile Ransomware
The SentinelOne Singularity platform detects and prevents execution of Mindware and SFile
ransomware strains.

9/11

For organizations not currently protected by SentinelOne, please see the list of Indicators of
Compromise at the end of this post and the technical indicators described above.

Conclusion
Indications suggest Mindware is likely a rebrand of SFile, or at least that the same source
code or builder for SFile is available to Mindware operators. While neither strain has
achieved the notoriety of some of the more well-known ransomware strains that have been
circulating recently, it may be that flying under the radar and hitting selective targets without
attracting too much public attention is exactly what the gang are aiming for.
We hope that the information in this post serves to enable security teams to ensure that they
have adequate resources to detect and prevent this threat. The SentinelOne Singularity
platform detects and protects against SFile, Mindware and all other known ransomware
threats. For more information about ransomware protection, see here. To learn more about
