Customized phishing lures distribute PupyRAT malware Wednesday, February 15, 2017 By:
Counter Threat Unit Research Team
SecureWorks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers analyzed a phishing campaign that
targeted a Middle Eastern organization in early January 2017. Some of messages were sent
from legitimate email addresses belonging to several Middle Eastern organizations.

Campaign details
The threat actor used shortened URLs in the body of the phishing emails that redirected to
several spoofed domains (See Table 1).

The downloaded document attempts to run a macro that then runs a PowerShell command.
This command downloads two additional PowerShell scripts that install PupyRAT, an opensource remote access trojan (RAT). According to the developer, PupyRAT is a “multi-platform
(Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function RAT and post-exploitation tool mainly written
in Python.” CTU™ analysis confirms that PupyRAT can give the threat actor full access to the
victim's system.

Conclusion
CTU analysis suggests this activity is related to Iranian threat actors closely aligned with or
acting on behalf of the COBALT GYPSY threat group (formerly labeled Threat Group-2889).
CTU researchers assess with high confidence that COBALT GYPSY is associated with Iranian
government-directed cyber operations, and it has used tactics similar to this campaign:
targeting Saudi financial, oil, and technology organizations
using job-themed lures to infect systems
registering spoofed domains
spearphishing new victims using legitimate email addresses

This campaign highlights the need for organizations to educate users about the risks of
spearphishing and shortened links. CTU researchers recommend that organizations disable
macros in Microsoft Office products to prevent attacks that leverage this functionality.
Organizations should also incorporate advanced malware prevention technology and endpoint
threat detection tools as part of their mitigation strategies.

Gauging confidence level
CTU researchers have adopted the grading system published by the U.S. Office of the
Director of National Intelligence to indicate confidence in their assessments:
High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality
information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid
judgment. A "high confidence" judgment is not a fact or a certainty, however, and such
judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.
Moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly sourced and
plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level
of confidence.
Low confidence generally means that the information's credibility and/or plausibility is
questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make
solid analytic inferences, or that [there are] significant concerns or problems with the
sources.
