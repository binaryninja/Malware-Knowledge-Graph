The Conti ransomware group takes over TrickBot malware operation
and plans to replace it with BazarBackdoor malware.
TrickBot operation has arrived at the end of the journey, according to AdvIntel some of its top
members move under the Conti ransomware gang, which is planning to replace the popular
banking Trojan with the stealthier BazarBackdoor.
TrickBot is a popular Windows banking Trojan that has been around since October 2016, its
authors have continuously upgraded it by implementing new features, including powerful
password-stealing capabilities.
TrickBot initially partnered with Ryuk ransomware that used it for initial access in the network
compromised by the botnet. Then Ryuk was replaced by Conti Ransomware gang who has
been using Trickbot for the same purpose.
“The group’s elite division, called Overdose, managed the TrickBot campaigns that resulted
in the creation of Conti and Ryuk ransomware.” states the analysis published by AdvInt. “The
group has made at least $200 million USD with one extreme case extorting ~$34 million USD
from a single victim and has perpetrated a spate of attacks on numerous healthcare
organizations, including Universal Health Services (UHS) via BazarBackdoor to Ryuk
ransomware (the attack was estimated for an account for $67 Million USD in damages).”

In 2021, the Conti gang used in exclusive the TrickBot to achieve initial accesses in the
network of organizations worldwide.
The goal of the Conti gang is to aggregate highly skilled members of the ransomware
ecosystem in a structure, which gives them a little autonomy, to monopolize the market.
The TrickBot’s core team of developers had already created a stealthier piece of malware
dubbed BazarBackdoor, used to achieve remote access into corporate networks and use it to
deploy the ransomware.
With the increasing popularity of TrickBot it became easy to detect it with antimalware
solutions, for this reason the gang began employing the BazarBackdoor for initial access to
networks.
By the end of 2021, Conti gang employed core developers and managers of the TrickBot
botnet.
“At the same time, Conti turned into the sole end-user of TrickBot’s botnet product. By the
end of 2021, Conti had essentially acquired TrickBot, with multiple elite developers and
managers joining the ransomware cosa nostra.” concludes the post.
“However, the people who have led TrickBot throughout its long run will not simply disappear.
After being “acquired” by Conti, they are now rich in prospects with the secure ground
beneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent.”
