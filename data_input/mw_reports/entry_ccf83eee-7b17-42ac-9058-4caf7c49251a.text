Network Formed by Individuals Who Advertised their Specialized
Technical Skills and Services on Underground Russian-Language
Online Criminal Forums
A complex transnational organized cybercrime network that used GozNym malware in an
attempt to steal an estimated $100 million from unsuspecting victims in the United States
and around the world has been dismantled as part of an international law enforcement
operation. GozNym infected tens of thousands of victim computers worldwide, primarily in
the United States and Europe. The operation was highlighted by the unprecedented
initiation of criminal prosecutions against members of the network in four different countries
as a result of cooperation between the United States, Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Germany,
Bulgaria, Europol and Eurojust.
United States Attorney Scott W. Brady of the Western District of Pennsylvania made the
announcement at Europol, located in The Hague, Netherlands, along with his international
partners.

The operation was conducted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District
of Pennsylvania and the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, along with the Office of the Prosecutor
General of Georgia, Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, Office of the Prosecutor General
of the Republic of Moldova, Public Prosecutor’s Office Verden (Germany), the Supreme
Prosecutor’s Office of Cassation of the Republic of Bulgaria, Ministry of Internal Affairs of
Georgia, National Police of Ukraine, General Police Inspectorate of the Republic of Moldova,
the Luneburg Police of Germany and the Republic of Bulgaria’s General Directorate for
Combatting Organized Crime with the significant assistance of Europol and Eurojust.
“International law enforcement has recognized that the only way to truly disrupt and defeat
transnational, anonymized networks is to do so in partnership,” said U.S. Attorney Brady.
“The collaborative and simultaneous prosecution of the members of the GozNym criminal
conspiracy in four countries represents a paradigm shift in how we investigate and prosecute
cybercrime. Cybercrime victimizes people all over the world. This prosecution represents an
international cooperative effort to bring cybercriminals to justice.”
Earlier today, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania unsealed an
Indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh charging 10 members of the
GozNym criminal network with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit
wire fraud and bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. An eleventh
member of the conspiracy was previously charged in a related Indictment. The victims of
these crimes were primarily U.S. businesses and their financial institutions, including a
number of victims located in the Western District of Pennsylvania.
“This takedown highlights the importance of collaborating with our international law
enforcement partners against this evolution of organized cybercrime,” said FBI Pittsburgh
Special Agent in Charge Robert Jones. “Successful investigation and prosecution is only
possible by sharing intelligence, credit and responsibility. Our adversaries know that we
are weakest along the seams and this case is a fantastic example of what we can
accomplish collectively."

According to the Indictment, the defendants conspired to:
infect victims’ computers with GozNym malware designed to capture victims’ online
banking login credentials;
use the captured login credentials to fraudulently gain unauthorized access to victims’
online bank accounts; and,
steal money from victims’ bank accounts and launder those funds using U.S. and
foreign beneficiary bank accounts controlled by the defendants.
The defendants reside in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria. The operation
was an unprecedented international effort to share evidence and initiate criminal
prosecutions against members of the same criminal network in multiple countries.

At the request of the United States, Krasimir Nikolov, aka “pablopicasso,” “salvadordali,” and
“karlo,” of Varna, Bulgaria, was searched and arrested by Bulgarian authorities and
extradited to the United States in December 2016 to face prosecution in the Western District
of Pennsylvania. Nikolov’s primary role in the conspiracy was that of a “casher” or “account
takeover specialist” who used victims’ stolen online banking credentials captured by GozNym
malware to access victims’ online bank accounts and attempt to steal victims’ money through
electronic funds transfers into bank accounts controlled by fellow conspirators. Nikolov is
named as a GozNym conspirator in the newly unsealed indictment, although he is charged in
a related Indictment filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania. Nikolov entered a guilty
plea in federal court in Pittsburgh on charges relating to his participation in the GozNym
conspiracy on April 10, 2019. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 30, 2019.
Five of the named defendants reside in Russia and remain fugitives from justice. However,
to overcome the inability to extradite the remaining defendants to the United States for
prosecution, an unprecedented effort was undertaken to share evidence and build
prosecutions against defendants in the remaining countries where they reside, including
Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova. The prosecutions are based on shared evidence acquired
through coordinated searches for evidence in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria, as
well as from evidence shared by the United States and Germany from their respective
investigations.
The GozNym network exemplified the concept of “cybercrime as a service.” According to the
Indictment, the defendants advertised their specialized technical skills and services on
underground, Russian-language, online criminal forums. The GozNym network was formed
when these individuals were recruited from the online forums and came together to use their
specialized technical skills and services in furtherance of the conspiracy.
According to the Indictment, Alexander Konovolov, aka “NoNe,” and “none_1,” age 35, of
Tbilisi, Georgia, was the primary organizer and leader of the GozNym network who
controlled more than 41,000 victim computers infected with GozNym malware. Konovolov
assembled the team of cybercriminals charged in the Indictment, in part by recruiting them
through the underground online criminal forums. Marat Kazandjian, aka “phant0m,” age 31,
of Kazakhstan and Tbilisi, Georgia, was allegedly Konovolov’s primary assistant and
technical administrator. Konovolov and Kazandjian are being prosecuted in Georgia for their
respective roles in the GozNym criminal network.
Gennady Kapkanov, aka “Hennadiy Kapkanov,” “flux,” “ffhost,” “firestarter,” and “User 41,”
age 36, of Poltava, Ukraine, was an administrator of a bulletproof hosting service known by
law enforcement and computer security researchers as the “Avalanche” network. This
network provided services to more than 200 cybercriminals, including Konovolov and
Kazandjian, and it hosted more than 20 different malware campaigns, including GozNym.
Kapkanov’s apartment in Poltava, Ukraine was searched in November 2016 during a
German-led operation to dismantle the network’s servers and other infrastructure. Kapkanov
was arrested for shooting an assault rifle through the door of his apartment at Ukrainian law

enforcement officers conducting the search. Through the coordinated efforts being
announced today, Kapkanov is now facing prosecution in Ukraine for his role in providing
bulletproof hosting services to the GozNym criminal network.
Alexander Van Hoof, aka “al666,” age 45, of Nikolaev, Ukraine, was a “cash-out” or “drop
master” who provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts he
controlled that were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims’ online bank
accounts.
Eduard Malanici, aka “JekaProf,” and “procryptgroup, age 32, of Balti, Moldova, provided
crypting services to cybercriminals. Malanici crypted GozNym malware in furtherance of the
conspiracy to enable the malware to avoid detection by anti-virus tools and protective
software on victims’ computers. Malanici, along with two associates, is being prosecuted in
Moldova.
Victims of the GozNym malware attacks include:
An asphalt and paving business located in New Castle, Pennsylvania;
A law firm located in Washington, DC;
A church located in Southlake, Texas;
An association dedicated to providing recreation programs and other services to
persons with disabilities located in Downers Grove, Illinois;
A distributor of neurosurgical and medical equipment headquartered in Freiburg,
Germany, with a U.S. subsidiary in Cape Coral, Florida;
A furniture business located in Chula Vista, California;
A provider of electrical safety devices located in Cumberland, Rhode Island;
A contracting business located in Warren, Michigan;
A casino located in Gulfport, Mississippi;
A stud farm located in Midway, Kentucky; and
A law office located in Wellesley, Massachusetts;
Five Russian nationals charged in the Indictment who remain fugitives from justice include:
Vladimir Gorin, aka “Voland,” “mrv,” and “riddler,” of Orenburg, Russia. Gorin was a
malware developer who oversaw the creation, development, management, and leasing of
GozNym malware, including to Alexander Konovolov.
Konstantin Volchkov, aka “elvi,” age 28, of Moscow, Russia, provided spamming services to
cybercriminals. Volchkov conducted spamming operations of GozNym malware on behalf of
the conspiracy. The spamming operations involved the mass distribution of GozNym
malware through “phishing” emails. The phishing emails were designed to appear legitimate
to entice the victim recipients into opening the emails and clicking on a malicious link or
attachment, which facilitated the downloading of GozNym onto the victims’ computers.

4/5

Ruslan Katirkin, aka “stratos,” and “xen,” age 31, of Kazan, Russia, resided in Khmelnytskyi,
Ukraine, during the time frame of the charged conspiracy. Katirkin, like Krasimir Nikolov, was
a “casher” or “account takeover specialist” who used victims’ stolen online banking
credentials captured by GozNym malware to access victims’ online bank accounts and
attempt to steal victims’ money through electronic funds transfers into bank accounts
controlled by fellow conspirators.
Viktor Vladimirovich Eremenko, aka “nfcorpi,” age 30, of Stavropol, Russia, and Farkhad
Rauf Ogly Manokhin, aka “frusa,” of Volgograd, Russia, were “cash-outs” or “drop masters”
on behalf of the GozNym criminal network. Like Alexander Van Hoof, Eremenko and
Manokhin provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts they
controlled that were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims’ online bank
accounts. Manokhin was arrested at the request of the United States while visiting Sri Lanka
in February 2017. Following his arrest, Manokhin was released on bail but was required to
remain in Sri Lanka pending the outcome of his extradition proceedings to the United States.
In December 2017, Manokhin unlawfully absconded from Sri Lanka and successfully fled
back to Russia prior to the conclusion of the extradition proceedings.
Other agencies and organizations partnering in this effort include the United States Secret
Service, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) in Pittsburgh and the
Shadowserver Foundation. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided
significant assistance throughout the investigation and spearheaded the efforts to enable the
United States to request searches, arrests, and extraditions in the foreign countries as well
as the sharing of evidence with those countries through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty
requests.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles A. “Tod” Eberle, Chief of
National Security and Cybercrime for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
