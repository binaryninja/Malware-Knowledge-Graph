GozNym Banking Malware: Gang Busted, But Is That The
End?

Amid all last week’s cybersecurity bad news, there was at least one bright spot for the
security world to cheer about. On Thursday, Europol announced that they had dismantled the
criminal network behind the GozNym banking malware, which has been aggressively
targeting businesses and financial institutions in multiple countries. According to Europol, a
botnet of some 41000 infected computers was using the GozNym malware to siphon up to
$100 million from its unsuspecting victims.

What is GozNym Malware?

2/8

GozNym is a hybrid creation specifically coded to, among other things, avoid detection by
legacy AV solutions. The gang had combined the Nymaim malware, a first stage loader with
persistence capabilities, with a second-stage infection containing a version of the Gozi ISFB
banking trojan, hence the name GozNym.
Nymaim has been around for several years but is notable for its ability to avoid security
solutions. As previous researchers have revealed, Nymaim checks for running processes
that belong to certain AV vendor products.

Although Nymaim was initially used as a dropper for ransomware, it has become increasingly
associated with banking malware since around 2015. It was first combined with Gozi as a
second stage payload in early 2016.
The Gozi banking trojan, aka Ursnif, is an established malware whose source code has been
leaked and analyzed several times over the past few years. Leaks allowed the GozNym
gang to cherrypick its most useful methodologies. Among those are the abilities to install an
MBR (Master Boot Record) rootkit and to generate a custom list of C2 servers using its own
Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA).
However, the primary engine underlying GozNym and related variants such as Dreambot,
IAP and PowerSniff, is ISFB – a dynamic link library (DLL) designed to analyze and modify
HTTP traffic on the victim’s computer. It is this component that allows the criminals to hijack
the user’s banking credentials through its ability to inject and manipulate a browser’s web
sessions.
Gozi ISFB also supports various plugins that are traded in underground marketplaces and
which can give it a variety of capabilities, such as stealing emails and passwords.

The GozNym Criminal Network
The criminal network behind GozNym was a sophisticated setup, Europol reported, spanning
four East European countries and orchestrated through underground, Russian-speaking
online criminal forums.

Spammers were employed to create and send hundreds of thousands of phishing emails.
The emails, designed to look like legitimate business correspondence, encouraged the
recipient to click on a malicious link or file attachment. Word.doc attachments with encrypted
VBA macros are, surprisingly, still an effective technique. If the social engineering trick
worked, the victim’s machine was redirected to a server that dropped the GozNym malware.

The purpose of the GozNym malware is to capture victims’ banking login credentials and
deliver these to the gang, who would then use the captured credentials to fraudulently gain
access to victims’ accounts. The stolen funds were then laundered through U.S and other
foreign bank accounts controlled by the criminals.
The gang’s complex operation required many layers of enterprising criminals tasked with
different duties.
The first stage primarily involved two people, the leader of the criminal network and a
developer. Other cybercriminals were recruited to provide specialist services and skills,
including coding. In order to cover their tracks, crypters were used to improve the malware’s
ability to evade AV solutions. The gang also employed spammers to create mass email
phishing campaigns to lure in potential victims. Another layer in the network involved the
Avalanche hosting service, which was used to register malicious domains and host the
malware. The web of criminals involved spread further to include account takeover

specialists who managed the victims’ hijacked online banking accounts and initiated
electronic transfers of funds. Finally, money launderers were used to provide bank accounts
that received the victims’ stolen funds.

Is That the End of GozNym?
While the good news is that the actors behind GozNym have been unmasked, unfortunately
they have not all been apprehended. The source code and methodology behind GozNym’s
creation is at least partially available (it is not currently known if the Nymaim source code has
been leaked), and there is clear evidence of cybercrime-as-a-service being an active
business model on the Dark Net and elsewhere.
Defenders should realize also that GozNym is only part of a family of related malwares that
have a long history and complex relationships:

I￼t has also been suggested that the powerful ISFB module that underlies this form of banking
trojan may be maintained and developed by at least three independent groups.
Given all that we know, it’s reasonably likely that GozNym or something similar will be seen
active in the wild again before long.

How to Protect Against GozNym
SentinelOne customers are already protected against GozNym malware as demonstrated in
this video. As soon as the malware attempts to execute, the SentinelOne agent on the
endpoint detects the threat and quarantines the malicious file, leaving the device in a clean,
uninfected state.
If you are not already protected by SentinelOne, try a free demo to see how our easy-to-use,
autonomous endpoint solution can protect your business.
