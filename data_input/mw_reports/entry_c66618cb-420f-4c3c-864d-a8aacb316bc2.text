Hackers have been taking advantage of the Coronavirus scare by employing a COVID
theme in their phishing pages and spam emails. In this blog, we will dig deeper into the
GuLoader malware which comes attached as a spam document in such emails. This
malware is a VBdownloader that has been used in many such malicious campaigns and
can be attributed to Gorgon APT, TA505 and TA542 threat groups among others.
GuLoader is a small VB5/6 file which typically downloads RATs, stealers or spies like
Formbook, Agent Tesla, Lokibot, Remcos RAT, NetWire RAT etc. We recently analyzed a
campaign which was using GuLoader to download and deliver Formbook from Google
Drive. While analyzing this campaign we were able to locate around 2100 GuLoader
samples which connect to multiple Google drive links and 130 samples which contact
OneDrive, in February, and by end of March, we were able to locate around 3300 new
samples which connect to Google drive and 250 samples which connect to OneDrive,
which is around 60% increase than the previous month. In total the number of Guloader is
around 6000+ samples in the past 3 months.

It is evident from the increasing numbers as shown in Figure 1, that this malware has
gained popularity and is being used for nefarious activities by various threat actors. The
popularity factor is because of some of its features like:
It is small and can be embedded in ISO image files and RAR files.
Stores its encrypted payload on Google Drive and OneDrive, which can later be
downloaded and decrypted by a simple xor operation.

Injects the decrypted payload into the targeted processes.

Predominantly used to deliver NanoCore RAT, Remcos RAT, Quasar RAT, NetWire
RAT, Agent Tesla and Formbook malware.
Uses anti-attach techniques.
GuLoader analysis
The infection chain of the campaign which downloads GuLoader is depicted in Figure 3.

The malicious VB file allocates virtual space to decrypt and execute the code responsible
for the following:
Debugger Anti-attach technique: The malware uses ZwSetInformationThread API
to detach itself from the debugger.
Patching ntdll.DbgBreakPoint and ntdll.RemoteUiRemoteBreakin: When we
attach a debugger to a running process it calls DebugActiveProcess API which in
turn calls RtlCreateUserThread function to create a new remote thread into the
targeted process with DbgUiRemoteBreakin function as its new thread’s starting
point. Therefore, a malware can easily hook ntdll.DbgBreakPoint and
ntdll.DbgUiRemoteBreakin API and patch them to the point that will cause the
process to exit or NOP (no operation) or to a point where it will call an unknown or
non-readable location.

Unhooking user mode hook: For behavior-based detection most of the Anti-Virus
products implement a user mode hook for some of the most common APIs used by
malware. To do that, they simply modify the 1st 5 bytes (0xb8 ????????) of the API
function with an unconditional (0xe9 ????????) jump to their hook handler. To avoid
this, the malware tries to rewrite the 1st 5 bytes to its original state even if the hook is
not in place.
Download payload from cloud storage: Downloads the file stored on Google
Drive/OneDrive and decrypts it.
It then injects this decrypted payload to the targeted process or creates a child
process of itself and overwrites the child process with the decrypted content from the
image base 0x400000.

These GuLoader exe files get downloaded and saved to the system after the Coronavirus
spam document is opened. This happens when macros are enabled by the victim or after
successful exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-11882 by the threat actors.
This is one of the major campaigns this year so far. Emails with the COVID theme, and
with the impersonation of trustworthy agencies like WHO, UNICEF, Govt Health agency,
etc., lure the recipient to open them and their attachments. With the ever growing concern
related to the Corona pandemic and people’s hunger for information, the COVID based
spam has been quite successful in gaining victims. We sifted through our pan-India
telemetry and we were able to find at least 60 hits for the last week of March and more
than 800 unique hits in the past 30 days or so.
