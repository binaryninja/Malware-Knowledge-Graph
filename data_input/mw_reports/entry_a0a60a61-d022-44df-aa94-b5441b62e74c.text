ESET researchers detect a new way of misusing Accessibility Service, the Achilles’ heel of Android
security
ESET researchers have analyzed an extremely dangerous Android app that can perform a host of
nefarious actions, notably wiping out the victim’s bank account or cryptocurrency wallet and taking over
their email or social media accounts. Called “DEFENSOR ID”, the banking trojan was available on Google

Play at the time of the analysis. The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however,
this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim –
enable Android’s Accessibility Service – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality.
The DEFENSOR ID app made it onto the heavily guarded Google Play store thanks to its extreme stealth.
Its creators reduced the app’s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious
functionalities but one: abusing Accessibility Service.
Accessibility Service is long known to be the Achilles’ heel of the Android operating system. Security
solutions can detect it in countless combinations with other suspicious permissions and functions, or
malicious functionalities – but when faced with no additional functionality nor permission, all failed to
trigger any alarm on DEFENSOR ID.
By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection
engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the
VirusTotal program (see Figure 1).

off the Play store

DEFENSOR ID was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version
is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its
profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on
May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on Google Play.
The developer name used, GAS Brazil, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users.
Apart from including the country’s name, the app’s name is probably intended to imply a relationship with
the antifraud solution named GAS Tecnologia. That security software is commonly installed on computers
in Brazil as several banks require it to log into their online banking. However, there is also an English
version of the DEFENSOR ID app (see Figure 3) besides the Portuguese one, and that app has neither
geographical nor language restrictions.
Playing further off the suggested GAS Tecnologia link, the app promises better security for its users. The
description in Portuguese promises more protection for the user’s applications, including end-to-end
encryption. Deceptively, the app was listed in the Education section.

applications, encryption for end-to-end users”)

Functionality
After starting, DEFENSOR ID requests the following permissions:
allow modify system settings
permit drawing over other apps, and
activate accessibility services.
If an unsuspecting user grants these permissions (see Figure 4), the trojan can read any text displayed in
any app the user may launch – and send it to the attackers. This means the attackers can steal the
victim’s credentials for logging into apps, SMS and email messages, displayed cryptocurrency private
keys, and even software-generated 2FA codes.
The fact the trojan can steal both the victim’s credentials and also can control their SMS messages and
generated 2FA codes means DEFENSOR ID’s operators can bypass two-factor authentication. This opens
the door to, for example, fully controlling the victim’s bank account.
To make sure the trojan survives a device restart, it abuses already activated accessibility services that will
launch the trojan right after start.

Figure 4. The permission requests by DEFENSOR ID

Our analysis shows the DEFENSOR ID trojan can execute 17 commands received from the attackercontrolled server such as uninstalling an app, launching an app and then performing any click/tap action
controlled remotely by the attacker (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. The list of commands DEFENSOR ID may get from its C&C server

In 2018, we saw similar behavior, but all the click actions were hardcoded and suited only for the app of
the attacker’s choice. In this case, the attacker can get the list of all installed apps and then remotely
launch the victim’s app of their choice to either steal credentials or perform malicious actions (e.g. send
funds via a wire transfer).
We believe that this is the reason the DEFENSOR ID trojan requests the user to allow “Modify system
settings”. Subsequently, the malware will change the screen off time-out to 10 minutes. This means that,
unless victims lock their devices via the hardware button, the timer provides plenty of time for the malware
to remotely perform malicious, in-app operations.
If the device gets locked, the malware can’t unlock it.

Malware data leak
When we analyzed the sample, we realized that the malware operators left the remote database with
some of the victims’ data freely accessible, without any authentication. The database contained the last
activity performed on around 60 compromised devices. We found no other information stolen from the
victims to be accessible.
Thanks to this data leak, we were able to confirm that the malware really worked as designed: the attacker
had access to the victims’ entered credentials, displayed or written emails and messages, etc.
Once we reached the non-secured database, we were able to directly observe the app’s malicious
behavior. To illustrate the level of threat the DEFENSOR ID app posed, we performed three tests.
First, we launched a banking app and entered the credentials there. The credentials were immediately
available in the leaky database – see Figure 6.

Second, we wrote a test message in an email client. We saw the message uploaded to the attackers’
server within a second – see Figure 7.

Third, we documented the trojan retrieving the Google Authenticator 2FA code.

database (right)

Along with the malicious DEFENSOR ID app, another malicious app named Defensor Digital was
discovered. Both apps shared the same C&C server, but we couldn’t investigate the latter as it had already
been removed from the Google Play store.
