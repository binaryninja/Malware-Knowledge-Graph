Council on Foreign Relations (CFR.org), a foreign policy web group, has been victim of a
targeted attack who seem to be linked to computer hackers traced to China.
Regarding information’s posted on the Washington Free Beacon, infected CFR.org website
was used to attack visitors in order to extract valuable information’s. The “drive-by” attack
was detected around 2:00 pm on Wednesday 26 December and CFR members who visited
the website between Wednesday and Thursday could have been infected and their data
compromised, the specialists said.
Through Washington Free Beacon news we know that only Internet Explorer 8 and higher
versions have been targeted. A possible Internet Explorer 0day was used to infect visitors
computers. We also know that the attack was limited to CFR members and website visitors
who used browsers configured for Chinese language characters.
As always, I was curious and tried to have more information’s regarding this attack and
potential 0day.
urlQuery.net investigations
On urlQuery.net, we can see that the first submission was done, the 20 December. More
interesting is the submission of 21 December on URL “/js/js/news_123432476.html“. “/js/js/”
directory seem to be a strange behavior. We can see that a “deployJava.js” was involved by
loading this page.
Other URLs are interesting like “/js/js/robots.txt“, “/js/js/today.swf“, “/js/js/news_435435s.html”
but all these URLs have been submitted the 27 December and after, and the file are no more
available.
jsunpack investigations
On jsunpack we can observe that the “deployJava.js” was submitted the 26 December. All
other files have been submitted the 27 December and after, and the file are no more
available.
CLEAN MX realtime database investigations
On CLEAN MX we can observe an analysis the 20 December.

Why so many parallel submission ? Ok guys, the infection has started since minimum the 20
December, so not since Wednesday 26 December. Now, if you have some skill in
researching information’s and if you are still curious, you will find part of the “drive-by” attack
source code. By doing some additional researches I found the source code of the “drive-by”
attack, and I can confirm you that this attack has started since minimum the 7 December !

Let analyze this source code.
I can confirm that only visitors with Internet Explorer 8 and higher versions have been
targeted.

But, a fact who was not pointed is if the visitor don’t has Adobe Flash, he will not be part of
the party, Flash free Internet Explorer are not targeted.

I can also confirm that visitors who used browsers configured for Chinese language
characters were targeted, but also Taiwanese and American visitors…

If you load the malicious page for the first time, a “visit” named cookie is create with a lifetime
of 7 days through the “DisplayInfo()” function. If you have already a cookie, you will no more
be exploited until the expiration of the cookie.

Then the page is loading the “download” Javascript function. This function is trying a XML
HTTP request to a “xsainfo.jpg” file. After some discussion with @binjo, it could be that
“xsainfo.jpg” maybe just a clean file, ajax trick to call the “callback” function.

“xsainfo.jpg” file is maybe “320e0729e1a50fd6a2aebf277cfcad66” found on VirScan and
VirusTotal. This file was submitted the 13 December.
The “callback” function verifies if the “xsainfo.jpg” has been loaded and that a “200” HTTP
status code has been returned.

If the visitor operating system is Windows 7 or Windows 2008 R2, an Office document is
opened through the “SharePoint.OpenDocuments” ActiveX control. Depending the way the
document is opened the “key” variable is initiated with funny values “boy” or “girl“. I’m not
specialist in this domain, maybe one of the blog post reader could provide some more
information’s.

3/6

Depending if you are “girl” or a “boy“, the “test” division of the HTML document will be
manipulated, a “today.swf” flash object will be loaded plus a “news.html” iframe.

If you are not a “girl” or a “boy“, you will need to have Java SE 6, but not JSE 7, in order to
load the two same files as previously mentioned. If the visitor operating system is Windows
XP, the “test” division of the HTML document will be also manipulated, and the two same files
are loaded.

Unfortunately, actually I didn’t find these two files, but after more discussions with @binjo it
could be that the swf is used to setup payload, “news.html” used to trigger the vulnerability.
So if 0day exist, this 0day is surely in “news.html” file, and it is also sure that this targeted
attack has not begin on Wednesday, not only targeted visitors who used browsers configured
for Chinese language characters.

I keep you in touch if I have additional information’s regarding this potential new Internet
Explorer 0day.
Update 1 – 12/29 2am:
FireEye has post some additional information’s regarding the attack. It seem that “today.swf”
trigger a heap spray in Internet Explorer in order to complete the compromise. Once the
browser is exploited, it appears to download “xsainfo.jpg,” which is the dropper encoded
using single-byte XOR (key: 0x83, ignoring null bytes).
What is also new regarding FireEye blog post is that their version is targeting English (U.S.),
Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese, Korean, or Russian. My version of 7
December was only targeting English (U.S.), Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), so the guys
had time to release new version of they’re code during this elapse of time. Also they didn’t
mention the news.html file.
Update 2 – 12/29 11am:
@binjo has release further information’s regarding “new IE 0day comingmshtml!CDwnBindInfo object use after free vulnerability”.
Also, I can observe that a certain number of people have samples of the 0day, I could not
imagine that an active exploit will not be out before the end of the year.
Update 3 – 12/29 6pm:
AlienVault has publish more detailed information’s regarding the attack and the 0day.
Update 4 – 12/29 10pm:
@_sinn3r is on the way to deliver a Metasploit module for the CFR.org 0day exploit.
