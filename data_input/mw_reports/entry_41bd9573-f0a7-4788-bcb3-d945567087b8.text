Executive Summary
This marks the third edition of the Modern Bank Heists report,
which takes an annual pulse of some of the financial industry’s
top CISOs and security leaders. Thank you, again, for reading
along and thank you to the 25 security leaders who participated
in this year’s survey.
This survey offers more than just data. We use the information
gleaned from this report to educate the market on how modern
cybercriminals are evolving; what tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTPs) are emerging; and how defenders can
keep pace. Perhaps most importantly, we use the information
to deliver a stronger cybersecurity platform to the market.
In this year’s survey, CISOs revealed what they’re seeing with
attack prevalence and evolution. Our questions tackled topics
including lateral movement, counter-incident response, island
hopping and integrity attacks. The financial sector is
not a new target for criminals. Of course, the bank heist has
evolved significantly—from stickups to cyberspace—but the
fundamental motivation behind the attacks has remained:
money. This evolution is best reflected in a conversation we
recently had with Jonah Force Hill, senior cyber policy advisor
and executive director of the U.S. Secret Service Cyber
Investigations Advisory Board (CIAB), who told us:

Island Hopping
Conclusion

“This year, while virtually all sectors of the global economy
fell victim to cybercrime of one kind or another, no sector
was more regularly targeted than the financial sector.
At an alarming rate, transnational organized crime groups
are leveraging specialist providers of cybercrime tools and
services to conduct a wide range of crimes against financial
institutions, including ransomware campaigns, distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks and business email
compromise (BEC) scams. Criminals are increasingly sharing
resources and information and reinvesting their illicit profits
into the development of new, even more destructive
capabilities. The growing availability of ready-made malware is
creating opportunities for even inexperienced criminal actors to
launch their own operations. When combined with a steady
commercial growth of mobile devices, cloud-based data
storage and services, and digital payment systems,
cybercriminals today have an ever-expanding host of
attack vectors to exploit. Every organization—providers of
financial services, in particular—must remain vigilant in the
face of these evolving threats. It is critical that organizations
maintain a continuous dialogue with law enforcement to ensure
a rapid response in the event of an incident.”
The authors would like to thank VMware Carbon Black Team
Cerberus for their analytics research for this report.

A Rise in Virtual Invasions

As to what specifically financial organizations are seeing, we dug into VMware Carbon Black
customer data. Kryptik and Emotet continue to be among the top attacks seen across multiple
sectors, including finance. These malware types are often used in longer, more complex
campaigns where the end goal is to leverage native operating system tools to remain invisible
or gain a foothold on one system (sometimes a supply-chain partner) to island hop to
a larger, more lucrative target.

Kryptik
The Kryptik trojan attempts to target victim machines via malicious installers. It then
attempts to acquire admin rights to make registry modifications, allowing it to execute
each time a Windows machine boots. The Kryptik trojan can be very persistent and,
without the appropriate visibility, can be difficult to detect as it attempts to delete its
executable file after running.
As noted by a threat profile from the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications
Integration Cell (NJCCIC): “[The Kryptik trojan] queries the Windows registry for the
.ini or .dat file paths. It also queries registry subkeys for the actual host, username, and
password related to the specific FTP client application. Kryptik searches the registry,
querying for both ftpIniName and InstallDir that hold the wcx_ftp.ini file. The trojan can
recover many common FTP clients, email clients, file browsers, and file manager programs.
Kryptik also can update itself and remotely download new versions.” 1

Emotet
Emotet is a family of banking malware, which has been around since at least 2014.
Attackers continue to leverage variants of Emotet and are becoming increasingly
shrewd in the techniques they employ to deliver the malware onto an infected system.

FIGURE 2: The most prevalent threats affecting the finance sector from March 2019 to February 2020.

Researchers have observed the adaptation to existing methods leveraging PowerShell, where
attackers were encrypting the URLs of the command and control (C2) systems used to host the
second stage payload. VMware Carbon Black has observed a spike in this type of technique
being detected across customers utilizing their managed hunting services.
Several attacks have been observed as originating from phishing campaigns that are
leveraging Microsoft Office Word documents with obfuscated VBScripts using PowerShell
and the ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet, which in the later stages is used to decrypt the C2(s)
and associated logic. This represented an evolution of current macro attack techniques, where
these types of cmdlets are not typically associated with phishing campaigns.

Conclusion

Attack Behaviors
Over the past two years, we’ve made a concerted effort to move beyond just looking at individual
pieces of malware and focus more deeply on attacker behavior. To that end, the MITRE ATT&CK
framework has set an excellent standard and closely aligns with the VMware Carbon Black belief that
detecting attacker behavior is exponentially more important than detecting malware alone.
With that in mind, we wanted to see what the top attacker behaviors targeting the financial sector
have been over the past 12 months.
According to MITRE, “adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a
system. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software running
on systems within the network. Adversaries may use the information from Process Discovery during
automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully
infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.” 2
This is of particular importance in the financial sector as cybercriminals have dramatically
increased their knowledge of the policies and procedures of financial institutions. They are keenly
aware of the incident response (IR) stratagems being employed by IR teams and the blind spots
that exist within every institution. Given the tactical shifts of the cognitive attack loop, they are
maintaining and manipulating their positions within networks because of the noise created by
incident response and the lack of security controls integration.

Conclusion

According to MITRE, “process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address
space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow
access to the process’s memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.
Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the
execution is masked under a legitimate process. Malware commonly utilizes process injection to
access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be
made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules
and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC)
mechanisms as a communication channel.” 3

Conclusion

A Rise in Virtual Invasions
There have been some interesting evolutions since our 2019 report. Of note, 64 percent of
surveyed financial institutions reported increased attempts of wire fraud transfer, a 17 percent
increase over 2019.
Wire fraud transfer attacks are often performed by exploiting business process gaps in the wire
transfer verification process or through social engineering attacks targeting customer service
representatives and consumers directly.
Cybercriminals exhibit tremendous situational awareness regarding SWIFT messaging. This is
compounded with their newfound understanding of the criticality of portfolio managers’ positions.
There has been an awakening in the dark web as it relates to the value of non-public market
information, which is stored on endpoints and often protected by legacy technology.
Trust and confidence can be undermined as cybercriminals appreciate that it is more valuable
to commandeer the digital transformation efforts of the financial institution than to target its
customers directly.

Conclusion

Island Hopping
33 percent of surveyed financial institutions said they’ve encountered island hopping, an attack
where supply chains and partners are commandeered to target the primary financial institution.

There are four types of island hopping most commonly seen today
Network-based island hopping is the most frequently used form of island hopping. With networkbased island hopping, attackers infiltrate one network and use it to hop onto an affiliate network.
While much less common, watering-hole attacks (one out of every five attacks targeting financial
institutions) still make up a solid portion of island-hopping attacks. In these attacks, hackers
target a website frequently visited by partners or customers of the organization they are trying to
breach. It is important to note that watering holes are not limited to websites and can manifest on
mobile applications.
There has been a newer trend in cybercrime that mainly targets the financial sector. Reverse
business email compromise attacks occur when a hacker successfully takes over a victim’s
email server and executes fileless malware attacks against members of the organization as well
as the board.
Island hopping as a service, or access mining is a tactic where an attacker leverages the footprint
and distribution of commodity malware—in this case, a cryptominer—using it to mask a hidden
agenda of selling system access to targeted machines on the dark web.

Conclusion

In 2019, the VMware Carbon Black Threat Analysis Unit uncovered a secondary component in a wellknown cryptomining campaign. The malware had been enhanced to exfiltrate system access
information for sale on the dark web. This discovery indicated a bigger trend of commodity malware
evolving and will likely catalyze a change in the way cybersecurity professionals classify, investigate
and protect themselves from commodity threats. Dark web forums now specialize in the sale of
access to specific financial institutions via provisioning access to buyers via a remote access trojan.
Destructive attacks are rarely conducted for financial gain. Rather, these attacks are launched
punitively to destroy data and dismantle subnets. It is worthy to note that cybercriminals in the
financial sector will typically only leverage destructive attacks as an escalation to burn the evidence
as part of a counter-incident response. According to MITRE, “Adversaries may destroy data and files
on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services,
and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic
techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.” It may have “worm-like
features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like Valid Accounts,
Credential Dumping, and Windows Admin Shares.” 4 This challenges us to become more clandestine
in how we conduct IR and to increase our threat hunting exercises.

Conclusion

Bank heists are transitioning to hostage situations. Cybercriminals have no desire to leave the
environment after the heist. They will fight to remain persistent on a financial institution’s network.
We expect this phenomenon to metastasize in 2020. Deletion of logs, manipulation of time stamps
and disabling of security controls will become par for the course.
Give these realities, it’s imperative we alter how we respond to incidents. Greg Foss, senior threat
researcher at VMware Carbon Black, suggests the following rule of five.

1. Stand up a secondary line of secure communications.
This is vital to discuss the ongoing incident. Assume that all internal communications can be
intercepted, viewed, modified and otherwise compromised by the adversary. These secondary
communications should allow for talk, text and file transfer.

2. Assume the adversary has multiple means of gaining access into the environment.
Shutting off one entry point may not actually remove them from your network. This will very likely
have just the opposite effect by notifying the attacker(s) that you’re onto them.

3. Watch and wait.
Do not immediately start blocking malware activity and shutting off access. Do not immediately
terminate the C2. To understand all avenues of re-entry, you must monitor the situation to fully
grasp the scope of the intrusion to effectively develop a means of actually removing the adversary
from the environment.

4. Deploy agents (if you must) in monitor-only mode.
If you begin blocking or otherwise impeding their activities, they will catch on and change tactics,
potentially leaving you blind to their additional means of re-entry.

5. Deploy honey tokens or deception grids.
Especially on attack paths that cannot be hardened.

Conclusion
Cybercriminals are evolving in both attack sophistication and organization. The financial sector is the
most secure industry in the world, but it is also being targeted by cybercriminals and nation-states.
We must pay close attention to how we respond to these threat actors and what their ultimate goal
is—hijacking your digital transformation efforts via island hopping. Cybersecurity is now a brand
protection imperative. Trust and confidence in the safety and soundness of your institution will
depend on it. This report should serve as a starting point for a discussion between the cybersecurity
community and the defenders of the financial sector on how we might best collaborate and wage a
counterinsurgency in cyberspace.
