A mysterious piece of malware that gives attackers surreptitious control over webcams,
keyboards, and other sensitive resources has been infecting Macs for at least five years. The
infections—known to number nearly 400 and possibly much higher—remained undetected
until recently and may have been active for almost a decade.

Patrick Wardle, a researcher with security firm Synack, said the malware is a variant of a
malicious program that came to light in January after circulating for at least two years.

images, and information about each infected Mac. Both generations of Fruitfly also collect
information about devices connected to the same network. After researchers from security
firm Malwarebytes discovered the earlier Fruitfly variant infecting four Macs, Apple updated
macOS to automatically detect the malware.
The variant found by Wardle, by contrast, has infected a much larger number of Macs while
remaining undetected by both macOS and commercial antivirus products. After analyzing the
new variant, Wardle was able to decrypt several backup domains that were hardcoded into
the malware. To his surprise, the domains remained available. Within two days of registering
one of the addresses, close to 400 infected Macs connected to the server, mostly from
homes located in the United States. Although Wardle did nothing more than observe the IP
address and user names of Macs that connected to his server, he had the ability to use the
malware to spy on the users who were unwittingly infected.
"This shows that there are people who are sick in the head who are attacking everyday Mac
users for insidious goals," Wardle told Ars. Although the method of infection remains
unknown, Wardle suspects it involves tricking users into clicking on malicious links, as
opposed to exploiting vulnerabilities in apps or in macOS. "A lot of Mac users are
overconfident in the security of their Mac. [The discovery] just goes to reiterate to everyday
users that there are perhaps people out there trying to hack their computers."

Why?
Besides the means of infection being unknown, the exact purpose of the malware is also
unclear. Wardle said he found no evidence the malware can be used to install ransomware
or collect banking credentials. That largely removes the possibility that Fruitfly developers
were motivated by financial profit. At the same time, the concentration of home users largely
rules out chances the malware was designed by state-sponsored hackers to spy on targets.
"I don't know if it's just some bored person or someone with perverse goals," Wardle said. "If
some bored teenager is spying on me, that would still be very emotionally traumatic. If it's
turning on the webcam, that's for perverse reasons."
Wardle said the primary command-and-control server used by the malware had been shut
down earlier but that many of the affected Macs had never been disinfected. As a result, the
infected Macs reported to the backup server as soon as it became available. The researcher
speculated that Fruitfly was therefore abandoned by its creators. As demonstrated by the
backup servers, the Macs remained susceptible to spying by anyone who took the time to
register one of the hardcoded domains.
Wardle has since reported all of his findings to law enforcement officials. He said all domains
known to be associated with the malware are no longer available, a move that essentially
neutralizes the threat. Apple representatives didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for
this post.

While the backup server Wardle set up allowed him to discover the Macs that remained
infected by the Fruitfly variant, it also allowed him to quickly analyze how the malware
worked. Typically, researchers must undertake a painstaking process known as reverse
engineering to document the inner workings. By infecting a lab computer and watching how it
interacted with the backup server, the researcher was able to more easily understand how
various commands worked. Wardle will speak about the process on Wednesday at the Black
Hat Security Conference in Las Vegas, in a briefing titled Offensive Malware Analysis:
Dissecting OSX/Fruitfly via a custom C&C Server.
One of the interesting aspects of the latest Fruitfly variant is that it flew under the radar for so
long. The malware relies on functions that were retired long ago and uses a crude method to
remain installed once a Mac is infected. Compared to newer, more sophisticated malware,
Fruitfly is much easier to detect. And yet, for whatever reason, no one caught it until recently.
Two pieces of Mac software developed by Wardle would have given victims a strong
indication they were infected. One, called BlockBlock, would have warned of the suspicious
launch agent used by the malware. A second tool, called Oversight, provides notification
anytime an app attempts to access a Mac's webcam or microphone. A recent submission to
the VirusTotal malware detection service shows that 19 of the top 56 AV- and endpointprotection products now detect the malware.
