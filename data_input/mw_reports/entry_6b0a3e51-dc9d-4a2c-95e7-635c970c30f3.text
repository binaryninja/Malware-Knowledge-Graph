TOM BURT, CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT, CUSTOMER SECURITY AND TRUST

The global events of the past 12 months have brought unprecedented change to the physical and digital
worlds. Cybercrime, however, is a constant. We’ve seen that cybercriminals continue—and sometimes
escalate—their activity in times of crisis. Defending against cybercriminals is a complex, ever-evolving, and
never-ending challenge.
But knowledge is power. For security professionals to create successful defense strategies, they need more
diverse and timelier insights into the threats they are defending against. We’re proud to provide the global
community with the latest in a long series of security intelligence reports. The Microsoft Digital Defense Report
is a reimagining of Microsoft’s Security Intelligence Report (SIR), first published in 2005, and it brings together
more insights, from more teams, across more areas of Microsoft than ever before targeting a broader audience
for consumption.

Our 2020 focus areas
2020 has brought major disruptions to both the physical and digital worlds, and these changes are also evident
in the cyberthreat landscape. Certain types of attacks have escalated as cybercriminals change tactics, leveraging
current events to take advantage of vulnerable targets and advance their activity through new channels. Change
brings opportunity, for both attackers and defenders, and this report will focus on the threats that are most
novel and relevant to the community in this moment.
Looking at the data and signals from the cross-company teams, three top-level areas came into the sharpest
focus: cybercrime, nation state threats, and the remote workforce.

Security and the remote workforce
Almost overnight, the workforce of thousands of organizations around the world became entirely remote.
School closures forced millions of students to rapidly transition to learning from home—and added significant
challenges for parents and caretakers. Although workforces around the world, regardless of size, have been
trending toward mobility in some aspects of their operations, few companies and learning institutions were set
up to operate 100% remotely. Operational tasks like software or device patching and updates had previously
been accomplished when mobile workers routinely returned to the office, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, this
option temporarily disappeared. At Microsoft, COVID-19 became a catalyst for managing a remote workforce
with immediacy and at scale.

Cybercrime is an ongoing and escalating challenge for both the public and private sectors around the globe.
It’s no longer effective to view cybercrime solely through the lens of a specific criminal or type of crime.

attacks, such as fraud, theft, and spying. It could be financially motivated, or nation state supported, or both.

What we’re seeing
Cybercrime follows the contemporary issues of the day
The threat environment we face continues to evolve. Cybercriminals are creative, well-resourced, well-organized,
and innovative. They move quickly to discover new threat vectors, use new exploits, and respond to new defenses.
Attackers are opportunistic and will even switch lure themes daily in accordance with news cycles, as seen in
cybercriminals’ use of the global COVID-19 pandemic to broadly target consumers, as well as to specifically
target hospitals and healthcare providers.

COVID-19-themed attacks: United States

The lack of basic security hygiene in any given ecosystem continues to enable cybercriminals to use well-known
vulnerabilities—or new variants of them—to exploit their environments. They also were observed to leverage
the fear and uncertainty associated with COVID-19 with great success. While the COVID-19-themed attacks
represent a small percentage of the total of malware we observed, our tracking of these themed attacks shows
how rapidly cybercriminals move to adapt their lures to the topics of the day.

As our threat intelligence teams at Microsoft actively monitor and respond to these shifts in focus, our telemetry
shows that, while the overall volume of malware remains largely the same, adversaries used the COVID-19
theme to socially engineer lures around the anxiety and the flood of information associated with the pandemic.
Attackers also exploited the crisis to reduce their dwell time within a victim’s system—compromising, exfiltrating
data, and in some cases ransoming quickly—apparently believing that there would be an increased willingness
to pay as a result of the outbreak. It’s a common understanding among defenders to “never waste a crisis” and
to use the information from the crisis to help inform the investments needed. Cybercriminals share the same
philosophy; they seek to blend their well-established tactics and malware with human curiosity and our need
for information.

Phishing and business email compromise

ACTIONABLE LEARNINGS

GLOSSARY

Credential phishing example

Email phishing in the enterprise context continues to grow and has become a dominant vector. Essentially,
phishing occurs when individuals or organizations receive a fraudulent email encouraging them to click on a
link, giving the cybercriminal access to a device or personal information.
From our view in Office 365 telemetry, we see customers facing three main forms of phishing:

1. Credential phishing
The cybercriminal attempts to pose as a well-known service in the email template (typically Microsoft and other
established enterprise SaaS services). They then try to lure the user into clicking on a link, which, through a
series of misdirections, will present a fake login page to the user. Once a credential has been compromised, it
can be used to launch different kill chains to build further persistence inside an organization by using cloud-only
APIs and systems, and to move around laterally to steal data, money, or otherwise breach the organization.
Example of credential phishing:
The cybercriminals begin by setting up a criminal infrastructure designed to steal an individual’s credentials
(phishing kits often contain everything they need for this). The cybercriminals send malicious email to the
unsuspecting individual, who then clicks on a link within the email. The individual might then be taken to a fake
web form to enter their credentials, or the site might contain malware that’s automatically downloaded to their
device, capturing credentials stored on the device or in the browser memory. The victim’s credentials are then
collected by the cybercriminals who use the credentials to gain access to legitimate websites or even the victim’s
corporate network.
Reduce risk of security breaches with strong authentication.² Strong authentication can protect your
users from the vast majority of identity attacks. Passwordless authentication options are recommended for
best security and user experience. Using an authenticator app is always the preferred option over SMS/voice
authentication.

2. Business email compromise (aka CEO fraud or vendor compromise)
Business email compromise is a type of phishing that specifically targets businesses. It’s characterized by
techniques used to pose as someone who the victims will likely take notice of, such as the company CEO, CFO,
or the accounts receivable clerk. BEC can also involve a business-to-business transaction. For example, the
cybercriminal might fraudulently access a company’s system and then pose as that company to fraudulently
request payment from another company.
Depending on the entity that gets impersonated or spoofed, the attack can be categorized as BEC, CEO fraud, or
vendor compromise.
While the industry and vendor-specific terminology for this class of attacks has been evolving, at its core it
employs three basic patterns of a cybercriminal posing as another entity:
• Cybercriminal creates an exact spoof of an established person or organization that the recipient has
a relationship with, and then gains trust to deliver the fraud. For example, the email comes from an
infrastructure controlled by the cybercriminal but appears to come from a legitimate person (sender address
is identical).
• Cybercriminal creates a look-alike impersonation of an established person or organization that the recipient
has a relationship with, and then gains trust to deliver the fraud. For example, the criminal signs up for and
sends from this account: YourCompanyCEO@outlook.com.
• Cybercriminal creates a look-alike domain and registers it for the sole purpose of delivering a BEC attack.
For example, instead of CEO@microsoft.com, the criminal sets up the domain micros0ft.com (number zero

At its core, BEC is a social engineering scam. However, given the increase in available information regarding
these schemes and technical advancements in detection, the criminals behind these attacks are now spending
significant time, money, and effort to develop scams that are sufficiently sophisticated to victimize increasingly
savvy professionals.

3. Combination of BEC and credential phishing

ACTIONABLE LEARNINGS

GLOSSARY

Example of BEC where cybercriminal masquerades as CEO

We’re also seeing new attack kill chains that combine the two forms to deliver more sophisticated kill chains.
This attack can start with credential phishing. Once an account is compromised, the cybercriminal sets up
mailbox “forwarding” rules to monitor for financial transactions. Often these forwarding rules include keywords
such as “invoice,” “accounts receivable,” “funds,” “overdue,” “payroll,” or “IBAN” and send all relevant email to a
collection email account controlled and monitored by the cybercriminal. The cybercriminal then inserts a victim
impersonation email in the middle of a communication to misdirect and steal money or information.
While credential phishing and BEC continue to be the dominant variations, we also see attacks on a user’s identity
and credential being attempted via password reuse and password spray attacks using legacy email protocols
such as IMAP and SMTP.
Example of BEC where cybercriminal masquerades as CEO:
Depending on the level of sophistication of the attack, the cybercriminals might begin by monitoring the
CEO’s mail account for information such as relationships within the company, common phrases used, business
activities or travel, and especially information about payments or wire transfers. The cybercriminals might set
mailbox forwarding rules using keywords such as “invoice” or “accounts receivable” so that mail containing these
words is directed to a drop email account that they control and monitor.
The cybercriminals can then send mail requesting sensitive information or payments to be made, using links
or instructions to wire payment to a fraudulent bank account. Unsuspecting employees will comply with the
requests, believing the requests come from the CEO, and wire the payment to the cybercriminal’s account.

In focus: Supply chain security
For years Microsoft has been tracking threat actors who use supply chain compromise as an entry point
for attacks. Supply chain attacks are particularly insidious because they take advantage of the trust that
users and organizations place in the hardware, software, and third-party services they use.

DART incident response initial attack vector
(June 2019–March 2020)

The increased number of supply chain attacks over the past few years has become an important topic in many cybersecurity conversations and is a growing
source of concern across the global supply chain. The past 12 months have been an unprecedented time of focus on supply chain security, given the
acceleration of interdependencies resulting from changes in global remote workforces in response to COVID-19, as well as new and evolving regulations
in the United States and Europe.

Summary of findings from the IoT security
research team:
• IoT threats are constantly expanding and
evolving. Honeypot data in the first half of 2020
indicate an approximate 35% increase in total
attack volume compared to the second half
of 2019.
• Vulnerability management plays a crucial
role in securing IoT assets, because when a
new vulnerability is discovered it’s rapidly
adopted by malicious actors. These actors take
advantage of the time it takes to patch and
update the firmware. Various scanners and
passive network-based profiling technologies
make this malicious capability achievable and
easy to deploy.

Despite the compelling reasons to secure ML systems, in a survey spanning 28 different organizations, we
found that most industry practitioners are yet to come to terms with adversarial machine learning.27 Of the 28
organizations surveyed, 25 indicated that they don’t have the right tools in place to secure their ML systems and
are explicitly looking for guidance.

Attacks on machine learning systems

ML can stitch together millions of lower fidelity anomalous signals into just tens of high-fidelity alerts.
In internal evaluations and measurements with customers, we found a median 90% reduction in alert fatigue
using a Microsoft technology called Fusion. In one application, Fusion evaluates tens of thousands of suspicious
uses of Tor browsers and hundreds of thousands of suspicious firewall rule violations per month, fusing them
together into just a dozen high-fidelity incidents of “compromised devices” that are surfaced to the SOC analyst.
Enrichment
Given the high number of investigations a SOC handles daily, it’s crucial to prioritize the investigations of users
with the highest impact to the organization, in case the account or device is breached. Enriching user metadata
with information about the user “blast radius” based on their position in the organization and role importance
provides this valuable prioritization and reduces the mean time to resolve the most critical incidents.
For example, a login by a user from a location they’re not usually associated with or have never used before,
would be considered suspicious and an alert would be issued. However, if the user’s peers were logging in from
the same location, this similar activity would indicate the event is probably benign and the associated alert
would be suppressed. This enrichment reduces mean time to resolution by enabling security personnel to focus

Leveraging machine learning to reduce alert fatigue
ML and alert fatigue
Alert fatigue is a huge concern, as security analysts face the burden of triaging and sifting through a sea of
alerts, often correlating alerts from different products manually or using a traditional correlation engine. One of
the top challenges in SOCs today is finding the balance: identifying unique, advanced threats while maintaining

valuable incidents in customer environments. To scale this effort and make it ubiquitous across the variety of
third-party and custom data types, we need the help of the security community—especially managed security
service providers (MSSPs) and large organizations that have the necessary security expertise. The major
challenge this community encounters is finding security analysts with data science skills needed to develop
ML models.
To address this challenge, we advocate democratizing the development of these security ML models, making
them accessible to security professionals with no data science background. SOC-ML is an effort to address this
challenge, allowing security analysts to customize a model within a familiar user experience, fitting it to the
needs of their organizations. It provides the ability to reduce alert fatigue by controlling the features used in the
ML model and the thresholds of the scores produced. SOC-ML also provides explainable model scores, which
has been a roadblock for wide ML adoption in security. Although democratization of ML continues to trickle into
various technology areas, SOC-ML is a unique and disruptive approach in the security space.

Leveraging anomaly detection for post-breach detection
Behavioral anomaly detection has become increasingly important in enhancing post-breach attack detection.
Once an attacker has penetrated the enterprise through phishing or other means, there’s very little labeled
data, and the attacker has a huge variety of options, reducing the applicability of supervised ML and suggesting
instead unsupervised methods that don’t require labeled data, such as anomaly detection.
While the methods of anomaly detection are varied, some common themes are present:
• Behavioral changes over time are important. Models that can encode time-varying behaviors such as
time-of-day, day-of-week, and other variations over time are critical for effective use in security settings.

• Automatic, streaming model updating is more suitable for anomaly detection than the batch train/test
process of supervised ML.
• The combination of weak anomalies (those that individually are prone to high false positive rates) to
produce strong, attack-relevant rarity is a powerful method to deploy anomaly detection in security
applications. Combining several rare events all indicating attack is much stronger than considering them
independently.
• For post-breach kill chain detection, graphs are the topology upon which we combine anomaly scores.

Tracking nation state threats
Microsoft tracks nation state activities to protect our platforms, our services, and our customers. We use a
variety of metrics and sophisticated data integration techniques to better understand targeting, motivations,
and customer impact. MSTIC focuses on nation state activities because these tactics, techniques, and
procedures are often unique and novel, prompting downstream actors such as cybercriminals and smaller
nation states to eventually copy their methods.
The use of open-source defensive toolkits to improve proactive detections of threats has increasingly become a
way for nation state actors to obfuscate their activity by hiding in plain sight using weaponized open-source code.

Country of activity origin
for NSNs (July 2019–June 2020)

MSTIC analysts focus on nation state activities regardless of platform, targeted victim, or geographical region,
and we maintain visibility and active threat hunting worldwide. The information presented here provides a
snapshot of customers impacted by nation state activity. It’s important to note that even if a particular industry
sector or geographic region isn’t represented in the information here, nation state activity spans nearly every
industry sector and geographic region. In other words, protections against these tactics are critical for every
organization and individual. Our intelligence is also impacted by the degree to which our products and
platforms are utilized in a particular geography or for particular purposes.

Nation state notifications
When a customer (organization or individual account holder) is targeted or compromised by nation state
activities that Microsoft tracks, we deliver a nation state notification (NSN) to the customer. Over the past
two years, Microsoft has delivered over 13,000 NSNs. The highest percentage of NSNs represented activity

Common targets and motivations
To provide a deeper analysis of some of the observed nation state activity, we look at frequently
targeted sectors and the motivations of the attackers.
Critical infrastructure

Top 6 targeted industry sectors by NSNs delivered (July 2019–June 2020)

Nation state activity is more likely to target
organizations outside of the critical infrastructure
sectors by a significant measure, with over 90% of
notifications served outside of these sectors.
Within the critical infrastructure sectors, targeting of
IT organizations represents over 60% of nation state
activity, followed by commercial facilities, critical
manufacturing, financial services, and the defense
industrial base.

Frequently targeted sectors
The sectors listed below were consistent targets
of nation state activity in the period from July 2019
through June 2020. We’ve listed them in order of
prevalence with respect to the number of NSNs
delivered to each sector.

Targeting major events and other opportunities
Major current events are commonly targeted by nation state actors or leveraged as opportunities to further
operational objectives. Microsoft has observed several such operations targeting events around the globe,
including elections and individuals tied to political campaigns as well as the Olympic Games. More recently,
several nation state actors took advantage of the global COVID-19 pandemic to craft targeted spearphishing lures in credential theft and malware deployment efforts.
Political campaigns
In a 30-day period between August and September
2019, MSTIC observed PHOSPHORUS performing
password sprays, making more than 2,700 attempts
to identify consumer email accounts belonging to
specific Microsoft customers, and then proceeding
to attack 241 of those accounts. The targeted

Common operational aims
Nation state actors often conduct intrusions in pursuit of larger strategic objectives, which they view as critical to the stability, prosperity, and sometimes survival of their
home nations. As such, these groups are highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources into achieving their operational objectives. Whatever the
strategic objective behind it, nation state cyberthreat activity has common operational aims: to steal information (about you, your business, personnel, customers, or
partners) or to disrupt or destroy components of your operations.

Disruption or destruction
Although less common than espionage, nation state threat actors have conducted intrusions intended to disrupt
or destroy data or physical assets at targeted facilities or institutions. The U.S. National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) defines a disruption as “an unplanned event that causes the general system or major
application to be inoperable for an unacceptable length of time.”36 Disruptive operations can, for example,
result in minor or extended power outages or extended network unavailability. Destructive operations involve
“overwriting, erasing, or physically destroying information,” equipment, or facilities.37
A look at past activities suggests nation state actors might engage in disruptive or destructive operations to
retaliate against actions by a perceived actor, to deter or discourage continuation of certain activities, or to test
new or developing cyber tools and techniques. For example, actors operating from Russia have a history of
launching disruptive and potentially destructive cyberattacks in response to perceived anti-Russian actions in
international sport. In advance of the Olympic Games in 2016 and 2018, respectively, suspected Russia-based
threat actors stole and leaked athletes’ sensitive medical data and rendered inoperable the servers comprising
the IT backbone of the Olympic Games.39
Late in 2019, Microsoft observed STRONTIUM attempting to compromise at least 16 national and international
sporting and anti-doping organizations across three continents. These attempts began when WADA announced
its decision to investigate Russia’s anti-doping agency in September 2019 and continued through December
2019 when WADA ultimately ruled to ban the Russian national team from participation in the Olympic Games.40

Introduction

BRET ARSENAULT, MICROSOFT CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER

A hallmark of the digital economy in the 21st century is the ability of employees to work from anywhere,
fueled by significant innovations in infrastructure, mobile endpoints, and communication applications.
Although there were increasingly more opportunities to work remotely in recent years, the COVID-19
pandemic catalyzed these efforts, forcing a significant portion of the workforce to work from home. As
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated, “We have seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.”43
The immediacy and scale of moving to a remote workforce brought along new security challenges. When

Microsoft employee badge scans for building access

Microsoft recommended employees work from home even before governmental regulations required it, its
workforce was able to respond quickly. As long as employees had secure, adequate internet access at their
remote locations, they could continue being fully productive and, most critically, they could protect themselves
and their families from the pandemic. We were successful in making this transition because we invested in a
Zero Trust architecture, including MFA, ubiquitous device management, and conditional access enforcement. The
graph on this page shows how quickly Microsoft became a remote workforce and the scale at which we had to
manage the requisite infrastructure, applications, and personnel.

SECURITY AND THE REMOTE WORKFORCE

As more organizations adapt to enabling secure remote work options, whether in the short or long term,
cybersecurity provides the foundation for operational resiliency. Successful transition in any type of disruption
requires a strategic combination of planning, response, and recovery. To maintain cyber resiliency, an
organization should regularly evaluate its risk threshold and ability to operationally execute key processes
through a combination of human efforts and technology products and services.

Security and remote workforce concerns
Security decision makers in the United States perceive their most common remote
workforce challenge as remote workers making choices that reduce security.
Securing personal devices for remote work and the increase in phishing campaigns
and identity fraud are also concerns.44

This chapter provides a look at three areas of risk that have become more apparent with the rapid onset of a
large-scale remote workforce. First, we’ll explain how organizations can support a secure, remote workforce
through the principles of Zero Trust, including VPN architecture and virtualization—which helped enable
Microsoft’s own transition to remote work. This section includes how we address security risks associated with
managing devices not owned by an organization (and often owned by employees and partners). Second, we
address the human element as fundamental to a secure workforce by looking at challenges such as insider
threats and social engineering by malicious actors. Third, we explore lessons learned as we engaged in an
exercise in enterprise resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak.

preventing two device management solutions from being deployed on one system. For example, a partner
device enrolled in the company’s device management system and using the policies defined by the company
could not also be enrolled in the Microsoft device management system and use the Microsoft policies.
Furthermore, there would be no guarantee or real-time visibility into the compliance state of those policies. As a
result, the options are:
1. Assume an implicit trust that the partner device is managed and has the appropriate policies deployed
and monitored for health.
2. Put an expectation in place that the partner must unenroll their device from their company management,
which would make their device unable to access their own company resources. A security risk associated
with remote workforces, as well as third-party vendors and partners, is a personally owned, unmanaged
device used from home that accesses organizational resources.
3. Migrate the partner to a virtualized experience, providing them the ability to access resources where the
data and controls continue to be managed by the organization, and their company policies continue to
be managed on the device.

Identity and access management
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft’s identity platform, is used by organizations for authenticating their
users to provide access to their applications and infrastructure. As the first line of defense to better protect users
from account compromise, organizations leverage Azure AD’s MFA capabilities. MFA is a process in which the
system prompts a user for an additional form of identification during sign-in, such as entering a code sent to
another device they own or providing a fingerprint scan. Organizations set authentication policies to define the
conditions under which users can access resources. For example, a policy might enforce MFA when a user logs in
from a new device, new location, or other criteria that enforce their security posture.
As a result of companies closing office access and limiting travel, user authentication patterns have
changed. We saw an approximate twofold increase in MFA-enablement requests after the onset of the COVID-19
outbreak, as work-from-home policies were enacted. The higher level of MFA traffic continued as many
organizations adopted the use of MFA to support a workforce that was no longer on company networks.

Enterprise resilience: The new reality
The circumstances of the extended COVID-19
pandemic, and the corporate response to it,
present an opportunity to forge resilience into the
enterprise. We must fold the lessons we’ve learned—
and the various strategies that we deployed to
survive the pandemic—into our broader
enterprise vision.
To some degree, the enterprise response to
COVID-19 changed our operational procedures as
well as the very vocabulary that we use to describe
the reactive measures and lessons learned. Terms
such as “extended security boundary,” “pandemic
resilience,” and “human infrastructure” are now the
subject of executive analyses and board briefings
around the globe. This new vocabulary highlights
the emergence of critical areas of resilience that
enterprises traditionally didn’t scrutinize.
Based on measures that have been put into place
to improve our security posture and incorporate the
lessons learned since the outbreak of COVID-19,
three critical areas have arisen to guide the drive
toward enterprise resilience. All three are anchored
in planning for the unanticipated.

The unanticipated shift of such a large percentage of

Adopt MFA
Multi-factor authentication can stop credential-based attacks dead in their tracks. Without access to the additional factor, the attacker
can’t access the account or protected resource. MFA should be mandatory for all admin accounts and is strongly recommended for all
users. The preferred method is to use an authenticator app rather than SMS or voice where possible.

Go passwordless
For organizations that use modern technologies like Windows 10, we recommend going passwordless by using face authentication,
fingerprints, or a PIN code. For organizations with applications or workloads that can’t be transitioned to passwordless, we recommend
adopting a secure password management solution, such as a password locker or vault and requiring that employees use unique,
randomized passwords for access to all sensitive information and on all servers and devices, including IoT and IoT controllers and network
infrastructure such as switches, routers, and firewalls.

Use good email hygiene
Because 90% of attacks start with an email, preventing phishing (and its voicemail- and text-based variants, vishing and SMiShing) can
limit the opportunity for attackers to succeed. Email hygiene platforms that incorporate filtering on the way in and link checking, like
Safelinks, when clicked (the way out) provide the most comprehensive protection. Consider limiting or disabling autoforwarding for email
unless you have a strong business need for it.

Modernize VPN architectures
Virtual private networks enable secure communications back to a central point. However, most organizations have transitioned significant
amounts of workloads to the cloud, making it unnecessary to point 100% of traffic back to the corporate VPN concentrator. A split tunnel
allows cloud traffic to connect to cloud resources securely, reducing load and overhead on the corporate VPN.

Patch apps and systems
Vendors are continually making security improvements and fixes, so it’s important to ensure that apps or platforms are using the most up-todate versions, including patches for existing VPN architectures. Ransomware operators and nation state actors have found network devices
like gateway and VPN appliances to be a practical target for intrusion. Apply all available security updates for VPN and firewall configurations.
Monitor and pay special attention to remote access infrastructure. Any detections from security products or anomalies found in event logs
should be investigated immediately. In the event of a compromise, ensure that any account used on these devices has a password reset
because the credentials could have been exfiltrated.

Manage configuration changes
Misconfigurations are another prominent attack vector and an example of how small changes can result in big problems. Implementing a
robust change management program enables companies to review changes before they’re made and confirm that the change won’t open
a new attack path or otherwise put the organization at risk.

Implement a secure software development lifecycle
Every organization is engaged in software development, whether they write it themselves or purchase it from a vendor. Even if robust
controls are in place lower in the stack, the organization is at risk if the app layer isn’t secure. We recommend a robust software
development lifecycle that includes threat modeling, design reviews, and static and dynamic application testing, in addition to penetration
testing in production.

Take a 3-2-1 approach to backups
Backups are essential for resilience after an organization has been breached. Apply the 3-2-1 rule for maximum protection and availability:
3 copies, original + 2 backups, 2 storage types, and 1 offsite or cold copy.

Monitor cross-cloud security
Most companies today use multiple cloud providers, and without visibility across all the clouds, including the IaaS and SaaS layers,
organizations don’t have a complete view of their risk profile. Modern SOCs should leverage SIEM tools that can collect and analyze
signals from all clouds in use and leverage a cloud access security broker (CASB) as appropriate for audit and control of SaaS.

Limit access with least privilege
To limit the risk of intentional, and unintentional, insider risk, practice the principle of least privilege and maintain good credential hygiene.
Avoid the use of domain-wide, admin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of remote
access trojans and other unwanted applications.

Leverage machine learning to increase fidelity and reduce alert fatigue
The explosion of data and signals has overwhelmed many SOCs and analysts. Look for modern SIEMs that use technologies like machine
learning to reduce the false positives and bubble up the alerts that really matter. ML can also help identify attackers that are using
behavioral-based attacks that might not be detected by traditional, rules-based systems.

Closely monitor legacy, certified, and industrial control systems
Keeping operating systems and apps patched and up to date is the best way to protect them. However, some systems can’t be upgraded
or patched owing to restrictions like certification levels or business limitations. For devices and apps that can’t be patched or upgraded,
additional monitoring can be tuned to keep a closer eye on access and behavior of legacy devices. Segmentation (covered below) is also
an important control here.

Slow attacks with network segmentation
When vulnerabilities are found on a number of systems, an attack can rip through a flat network in a matter of minutes. Additionally,
devices and systems with highly sensitive data often need to be protected at higher levels of control. Segmenting networks provides
security to limit the spread of attacks and enables organizations to place stricter controls in front of sensitive enclaves. Segmentation can
also help to protect unpatched or unpatchable systems from attack.

Manage the convergence of OT and IT
Traditionally cordoned-off OT networks are converging with IT networks. Many OT networks relied on segmentation and access controls
for security, but as they’re opened to the internet and the cloud, they’re increasingly overlapping with IT. Organizations must have a
strategy in place to protect OT post-convergence.

Secure IoT and IIoT
The IoT and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are pushing the boundary of security management. Many IIoT devices are legacy
brownfield and dependent on older OT-type protections. For comprehensive security, organizations must bring IoT and IIoT into their
security program, with management and governance for the legacy devices and systems, and by building out modern, trusted solutions
for greenfield deployments. For more on this approach, see The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices.

Know your perimeter
Endpoints are a common target for attackers. Weak endpoints can become beachheads for network infiltration and reconnaissance
activity. With the COVID-19-driven shift to remote workforces, endpoints are farther away from the corporate network and sprawling with
new software installs for video conferencing and other collaborative activities. A robust endpoint detection and response solution must be
installed on endpoints to keep them protected, and some form of endpoint management is strongly recommended.

Limit perimeter exposure
Understand and control perimeter exposure. Attacks often start with devices that aren’t in asset inventories but are still members of the
primary Active Directory domain. These devices often have matching local admin passwords or service accounts with highly privileged
domain credentials logging on to them. To limit perimeter exposure, an organization needs an up-to-date inventory that includes all
members of the Active Directory domain, and these devices should be monitored and managed. Perimeter exposure can also be managed
on the network by implementing segmentation (via switches, routers, firewalls) and throughout the cloud with solutions such as CASBs.

Build a third-party risk program
Partners, suppliers, and contractors interact with data and applications connected to an organization’s corporate environments, and
attackers are increasingly targeting providers, like MSSPs, in order to gain access to the MSSP’s clients’ credentials and networks. This
means that your partner’s risk is your inherited risk, and it should be managed through robust service level agreements, attestations, and
shared assessments like SSAE 18 SOC 1 and SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and ISO 20001.

Invest in user training (and keep training)
Users can be the weakest link or the first line of defense. When security awareness is institutionalized at an organizational level, end users
can be the early responders to activity that might indicate compromise. Train users on what attacks look like and provide them with a way
to report unusual activity.

Adopt a Zero Trust mindset
Instead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, assume breach and verify each request as though it originates from
an open network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, every request is fully authenticated, authorized,
and encrypted before granting access.
