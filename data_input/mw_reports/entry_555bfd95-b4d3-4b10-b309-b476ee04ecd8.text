Introduction:
Over the last few years, the number of “APT­related” incidents
described in the media has grown significantly. For many of
these, though, the designation “APT”, indicating an “Advanced
Persistent Threat”, is usually an exaggeration. With some notable
exceptions, few of the threat actors usually described in the
media are advanced. These exceptions, which in our opinion
represent the pinnacle of cyberespionage tools: the truly
“advanced” threat actors out there, are Equation, Regin, Duqu or

Careto. Another such an exceptional espionage platform is
“ProjectSauron”, also known as “Strider”.

What differentiates a truly advanced threat actor from a wannabe
APT? Here are a few features that characterize the ‘top’
cyberespionage groups:

The use of zero day exploits
Unknown, never identified infection vectors
Have compromised multiple government organizations in
several countries
Have successfully stolen information for many years before
being discovered
Have the ability to steal information from air gapped networks
Support multiple covert exfiltration channels on various
protocols
Malware modules which can exist only in memory without
touching the disk
Unusual persistence techniques which sometime use
undocumented OS features
“ProjectSauron” easily covers many of these points.

From discovery to detection:
When talking about long­standing cyber­espionage campaigns,
many people wonder why it took so long to catch them. Perhaps
one of the explanations is having the right tools for the right job.
Trying to catch government or military grade malware requires
specialized technologies and products. One such product is
Kaspersky’s AntiTargeted Attacks Platform, KATA
(http://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise­security/anti­targeted­
attack­platform). In September 2015, our anti­targeted attack
technologies caught a previously unknown attack. The suspicious
module was an executable library, loaded in the memory of a
Windows domain controller (DC). The library was registered as a
Windows password filter and had access to sensitive data in
cleartext. Additional research revealed signs of massive activity
from a new threat actor that we codenamed ‘ProjectSauron’,
responsible for large­scale attacks against key governmental
entities in several countries.

“SAURON” – internal name used in the LUA scripts

ProjectSauron comprises a top­of­the­top modular cyber­
espionage platform in terms of technical sophistication, designed
to enable long­term campaigns through stealthy survival
mechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods. Technical
details show how attackers learned from other extremely
advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their mistakes. For
example, all artifacts are customized per given target, reducing
their value as indicators of compromise for any other victim.

Some other key features of ProjectSauron:

It is a modular platform designed to enable long­term cyber­
espionage campaigns.
All modules and network protocols use strong encryption
algorithms, such as RC6, RC5, RC4, AES, Salsa20, etc.
It uses a modified LUA scripting engine to implement the core
platform and its plugins.
There are upwards of 50 different plugin types.
The actor behind ProjectSauron has a high interest in
communication encryption software widely used by targeted
governmental organizations. It steals encryption keys,
configuration files, and IP addresses of the key infrastructure
servers related to the encryption software.
It is able to exfiltrate data from air­gapped networks by using
specially­prepared USB storage drives where data is stored in
an area invisible to the operation system.
The platform makes extensive use of the DNS protocol for
data exfiltration and real­time status reporting.
The APT was operational as early as June 2011 and
remained active until April 2016.
The initial infection vector used to penetrate victim networks
remains unknown.
The attackers utilize legitimate software distribution channels
for lateral movement within infected networks.

platform, we’ve prepared an FAQ which brings together some of
the most important points about this attacker and its tools. A brief
technical report is also available, including IOCs and Yara rules.

ProjectSauron FAQ:
1. What is ProjectSauron?
ProjectSauron is the name for a top level modular cyber­
espionage platform, designed to enable and manage long­term
campaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with
multiple exfiltration methods.

Technical details show how attackers learned from other
extremely advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their
mistakes. As such, all artifacts are customized per given target,
reducing their value as indicators of compromise for any other
victim.

Usually APT campaigns have a geographical nexus, aimed at
extracting information within a specific region or from a given
industry. That usually results in several infections in countries
within that region, or in the targeted industry around the world.
Interestingly, ProjectSauron seems to be dedicated to just a
couple of countries, focused on collecting high value intelligence
by compromising almost all key entities it could possibly reach
within the target area.
The name, ProjectSauron reflects the fact that the code authors
refer to ‘Sauron’ in the LUA scripts.

2. Who are the victims?
Using our telemetry, we found more than 30 infected
organizations in Russia, Iran, Rwanda and possibly in Italian­
speaking countries as well. Many more organizations and
geographies are likely to be affected.

The attacked organizations are key entities that provide core

state functions:

Government
Scientific research centers
Military
Telecommunication providers
Finance

3. Have you notiﬁed victims?
As usual, Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with industry
partners, CERTs and law enforcement agencies to notify victims
and help to mitigate the threat. We also rely on public awareness
to spread information about it. If you need more information about
this actor, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.

4. For how long have the attackers been
active?
Forensic analysis indicates that the APT has been operational
since at least June 2011 and was still active in 2016. Although it
appears to have largely ceased, there is a chance that it is still
active on computer systems that are not covered by Kaspersky
Lab solutions.

5. Did the attackers use interesting or
advanced techniques?
The attackers used multiple interesting and unusual techniques,
including:

Data exfiltration and real­time status reporting using DNS
requests.
Implant deployment using legitimate software update scripts.
Data exfiltration from air­gapped networks through the use of
specially prepared USB storage drives where the stolen data
is stored in the area unused by standard tools of the
operating system.
Using a modified LUA scripting engine to implement the core
platform and its plugins. The use of LUA components in
malware is very rare – it was previously spotted in the Flame
and Animal Farm attacks.

6. How did you discover this malware?

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

In September 2015, Kaspersky Lab’s Anti­Targeted Attack
Platform discovered anomalous network traffic in a client
organization’s network. Analysis of this incident led to the
discovery of a strange executable program library loaded into the
memory of the domain controller server. The library was
registered as a Windows password filter and had access to
sensitive data such as administrative passwords in cleartext.
Additional research revealed signs of activity of a previously
unknown threat actor.

7. How does ProjectSauron operate?
ProjectSauron usually registers its persistence module on domain
controllers as a Windows LSA (Local Security Authority)
password filter. This feature is typically used by system
administrators to enforce password policies and validate new
passwords to match specific requirements, such as length and
complexity. This way, the ProjectSauron passive backdoor
module starts every time any network or local user (including an
administrator) logs in or changes a password, and promptly
harvests the password in plaintext.

In cases where domain controllers lack direct Internet access, the
attackers install additional implants on other local servers which
have both local network and Internet access and may pass
through significant amount of network traffic, i.e. proxy­servers,
web­servers, or software update servers. After that, these
intermediary servers are used by ProjectSauron as internal proxy
nodes for silent and inconspicuous data exfiltration, blending in
with high volumes of legitimate traffic.

Once installed, the main ProjectSauron modules start working as
‘sleeper cells’, displaying no activity of their own and waiting for
‘wake­up’ commands in the incoming network traffic. This method
of operation ensures ProjectSauron’s extended persistence on
the servers of targeted organizations.

8. What kind of implants does
ProjectSauron use?
Most of ProjectSauron’s core implants are designed to work as
backdoors, downloading new modules or running commands
from the attacker purely in memory. The only way to capture
these modules is by making a full memory dump of the infected
systems.

6/15

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

Almost all of ProjectSauron’s core implants are unique, have
different file names and sizes, and are individually built for each
target. Each module’s timestamp, both in the file system and in its
own headers, is tailored to the environment on which it is
installed.

Secondary ProjectSauron modules are designed to perform
specific functions like stealing documents, recording keystrokes,
and stealing encryption keys from both infected computers and
attached USB sticks.

ProjectSauron implements a modular architecture using its own
virtual file system to store additional modules (plugins) and a
modified LUA interpreter to execute internal scripts. There are
upwards of 50 different plugin types.

9. What is the initial infection vector?
To date, the initial infection vector used by ProjectSauron to
penetrate victim networks remains unknown.

10. How were the ProjectSauron
implants deployed within the target
network?
In several cases, ProjectSauron modules were deployed through
the modification of scripts used by system administrators to
centrally deploy legitimate software updates within the network.
In essence, the attackers injected a command to start the
malware by modifying existing software deployment scripts. The
injected malware is a tiny module that works as a simple
downloader.

Once started under a network administrator account, this small
downloader connects to a hard­coded internal or external IP
address and downloads the bigger ProjectSauron payload from
there.

In cases where the ProjectSauron persistence container is stored
on disk in EXE file format, it disguises the files with legitimate
software file names.

11. What C&C infrastructure did the

7/15

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

11. What C&C infrastructure did the
attackers use?
The ProjectSauron actor is extremely well prepared when it
comes to operational security. Running an expensive
cyberespionage campaign like ProjectSauron requires vast
domain and server infrastructure uniquely assigned to each victim
organization and never reused again. This makes traditional
network­based indicators of compromise almost useless because
they won’t be reused in any other organization.

We collected 28 domains linked to 11 IPs located in the United
States and several European countries that might be connected
to ProjectSauron campaigns. Even the diversity of ISPs selected
for ProjectSauron operations makes it clear that the actor did
everything possible to avoid creating patterns.

12. Does ProjectSauron target isolated
(air-gapped) networks?
Yes. We registered a few cases where ProjectSauron
successfully penetrated air­gapped networks.

The ProjectSauron toolkit contains a special module designed to
move data from air­gapped networks to Internet­connected
systems. To achieve this, removable USB devices are used.
Once networked systems are compromised, the attackers wait for
a USB drive to be attached to the infected machine.

These USBs are specially formatted to reduce the size of the
partition on the USB disk, reserving an amount of hidden data
(several hundred megabytes) at the end of the disk for malicious
purposes. This reserved space is used to create a new custom­
encrypted partition that won’t be recognized by a common OS,
such as Windows. The partition has its own semi­filesystem (or
virtual file system, VFS) with two core directories: ‘In’ and ‘Out’.
This method also bypasses many DLP products, since software
that disables the plugging of unknown USB devices based on
DeviceID wouldn’t prevent an attack or data leakage, because a
genuine recognized USB drive was used.

13. Does ProjectSauron target critical
infrastructure?

https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/75533/faq-the-projectsauron-apt/

8/15

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

infrastructure?
Some of the entities infected by ProjectSauron can be classified
as critical infrastructure. However, we haven’t registered
ProjectSauron infections inside industrial control system networks
that have SCADA systems in place.

Also, we have not yet seen a ProjectSauron module targeting any
specific industrial hardware or software.

14. Did ProjectSauron use any special
communication methods?
For network communication, the ProjectSauron toolkit has
extensive abilities, leveraging the stack of the most commonly
used protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP, DNS, SMTP and HTTP.

One of the ProjectSauron plugins is the DNS data exfiltration tool.
To avoid generic detection of DNS tunnels at network level, the
attackers use it in low­bandwidth mode, which is why it is used
solely to exfiltrate target system metadata.

Another interesting feature in ProjectSauron malware that
leverages the DNS protocol is the real­time reporting of the
operation progress to a remote server. Once an operational
milestone is achieved, ProjectSauron issues a DNS­request to a
special subdomain unique to each target.

15. What is the most sophisticated
feature of the ProjectSauron APT?
In general, the ProjectSauron platform is very advanced and
reaches the level of complexity of Regin, Equation and similar
threat actors we have reported on in the past. Some of the most
interesting things in the ProjectSauron platform include:
Multiple exfiltration mechanisms, including piggybacking on
known protocols.
Bypassing air­gaps using hidden data partitions on USB
sticks.
Hijacking Windows LSA to control network domain servers.
Implementing an extended LUA engine to write custom
malicious scripts to control the entire malware platform with a

9/15

2016/8/9

high­level language.

16. Are the attackers using any zero-day
vulnerabilities?
To date we have not found any 0­day exploits associated with
ProjectSauron.

However, when penetrating isolated systems, the creation of the
encrypted storage area in the USB does not in itself enable
attackers to get control of the air­gapped machines. There has to
be another component such as a 0day exploit placed on the main
partition of the USB drive.

So far we have not found any 0­day exploit embedded in the body
of the malware we analyzed, and we believe it was probably
deployed in rare, hard­to­catch instances.

17. Is this a Windows-only threat? What
versions of Windows are targeted?
ProjectSauron works on all modern Microsoft Windows operating
systems – both x64 and x86. We have witnessed infections
running on Windows XP x86 as well as Windows 2012 R2 Server
Edition x64.

To date, we haven’t found a non­Windows version of
ProjectSauron.

18. Were the attackers hunting for
speciﬁc information?
ProjectSauron actively searches for information related to rather
uncommon, custom network encryption software. This client­
server software is widely adopted by many of the target
organizations to secure communications, voice, email, and
document exchange.
In a number of the cases we analyzed, ProjectSauron deployed
malicious modules inside the custom network encryption’s
software directory, disguised under similar filenames and
accessing the data placed beside its own executable. Some of
extracted LUA scripts show that the attackers have a high interest
in the software components, keys, configuration files, and the
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/75533/faq-the-projectsauron-apt/

10/15

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

location of servers that relay encrypted messages between the
nodes.

Also, one of the embedded ProjectSauron configurations contains
a special unique identifier for the targeted network encryption
software’s server within its virtual network. The behavior of the
component that searches for the server IP address is unusual.
After getting the IP, the ProjectSauron component tries to
communicate with the remote server using its own
(ProjectSauron) protocol as if it was yet another C&C server. This
suggests that some communication servers running the
mentioned network encryption software could also be infected
with ProjectSauron.

19. What exactly is being stolen from the
targeted machines?
The ProjectSauron modules we found are able to steal
documents, record keystrokes and steal encryption keys from
infected computers and attached USB sticks.

The fragment of configuration block below, extracted from
ProjectSauron, shows the kind of information and file extensions
the attackers were looking for:

.*account.*|.*acct.*|.*domain.*|.*login.*|.*member.*|.*user.*|.*na
me|.*email|.*_id|id|uid|mn|mailaddress|.*nick.*|alias|codice|uin|

Interestingly, while most of the words and extensions above are in
the English language, several of them point to Italian, such as:

‘codice’, ‘strCodUtente’ and ‘segreto’.

Keywords / filenames targeted by ProjectSauron data theft
modules:

Italian keyword

Translation

Codice

CodUtente

Usercode

Segreto

Secret

This suggests the attackers had prepared to attack Italian­
speaking targets as well. However, we are not aware of any
Italian victims of ProjectSauron at the moment.

20. Have you observed any artifacts
indicating who is behind the
ProjectSauron APT?
Attribution is hard and reliable attribution is rarely possible in
cyberspace. Even with confidence in various indicators and
apparent attacker mistakes, there is a greater likelihood that
these are smoke and mirrors created by an attacker with a
greater vantage point and vast resources. When dealing with the
most advanced threat actors, as is the case with ProjectSauron,
attribution becomes an unsolvable problem.

21. Is this a nation-state sponsored
attack?
We think an operation of such complexity, aimed at stealing
confidential and secret information, can only be executed with
support from a nation­state.

22. What would ProjectSauron have cost
to set up and run?
Kaspersky Lab has no exact data on this, but estimates that the
development and operation of ProjectSauron is likely to have
required several specialist teams and a budget probably running
into millions of dollars.

23. How does the ProjectSauron

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

23. How does the ProjectSauron
platform compare to other top-level
threat actors?
The actor behind ProjectSauron is very advanced, comparable
only to the top­of­the­top in terms of sophistication: alongside
Duqu, Flame, Equation, and Regin. Whether related or unrelated
to these advanced actors, the ProjectSauron attackers have
definitely learned from them.

As a reminder, here are some features of other APT attackers
which we discovered that the ProjectSauron attackers had
carefully learned from or emulated:

Duqu:

Use of intranet C&Cs (where compromised target servers
may act as independent C&Cs)
Running only in memory (persistence on a few gateway hosts
only)
Use of different encryption methods per victim
Use of named pipes for LAN communication
Malware distribution through legitimate software deployment
channels
Flame:
LUA­embedded code
Secure file deletion (through data wiping)
Attacking air­gapped systems via removable devices
Equation and Regin:

Usage of RC5/RC6 encryption
Virtual Filesystems (VFS)
Attacking air­gapped systems via removable devices
Hidden data storage on removable devices
These other actors also showed what made them vulnerable to
potential exposure, and ProjectSauron did its best to address
these issues:

Vulnerable or persistent C&C locations
ISP name, IP, domain, and tools reuse across different
campaigns

13/15

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

Crypto­algorithm reuse (as well as encryption keys)
Forensic footprint on disk
Timestamps in various components
Large volumes of exfiltrated data, alarming unknown
protocols or message formats
In addition, it appears that the attackers took special care with
what we consider as indicators of compromise and implemented
a unique pattern for each and every target they attacked, so that
the same indicators would have little value for anyone else. This
is a summary of the ProjectSauron strategy as we see it. The
attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always
looking for patterns. Remove the patterns and the operation will
be harder to discover. We are aware of more than 30
organizations attacked, but we are sure that this is just a tiny tip
of the iceberg.

24. Do Kaspersky Lab products detect
all variants of this malware?
All Kaspersky Lab products detect ProjectSauron samples as
HEUR:Trojan.Multi.Remsec.gen

25. Are there Indicators of Compromise
(IOCs) to help victims identify the
intrusion?
ProjectSauron’s tactics are designed to avoid creating patterns.
Implants and infrastructure are customized for each individual
target and never re­used – so the standard security approach of
publishing and checking for the same basic indicators of
compromise (IOC) is of little use.

However, structural code similarities are inevitable, especially for
non­compressed and non­encrypted code. This opens up the
possibility of recognizing known code in some cases.

That’s why, alongside the formal IOCs, we have added relevant
YARA rules. While the IOCs have been listed mainly to give
examples of what they look like, the YARA rules are likely to be of
greater use and could detect real traces of ProjectSauron.
For background: YARA is a tool for uncovering malicious files or
patterns of suspicious activity on systems or networks that share

14/15

2016/8/9

ProjectSauron: top level cyber-espionage platform covertly extracts encrypted government comms - Securelist

similarities. YARA rules—basically search strings—help analysts
to find, group, and categorize related malware samples and draw
connections between them in order to build malware families and
uncover groups of attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.

We have prepared our YARA rules based on tiny similarities and
oddities that stood out in the attackers’ techniques. These rules
can be used to scan networks and systems for the same patterns
of code. If some of these oddities appear during such a scan,
there is a chance that the organizations has been hit by the same
actor.
