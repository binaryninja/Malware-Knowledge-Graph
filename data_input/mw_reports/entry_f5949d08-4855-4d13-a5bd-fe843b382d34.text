ESET has analyzed a sophisticated and extremely dangerous malware, known as
Industroyer, which is designed to disrupt critical industrial processes.
Update (July 17th): The authors of the Industroyer research, Anton Cherepanov and Robert
Lipovsky, will present their findings at Black Hat USA in Las Vegas on July 26th, 2017. More
information can be found here.
The 2016 attack on Ukraine’s power grid that deprived part of its capital, Kiev, of power for
an hour was caused by a cyberattack. ESET researchers have since analyzed samples of
malware, detected by ESET as Win32/Industroyer, capable of performing exactly that type
of attack.
Whether the same malware was really involved in what cybersecurity experts consider to
have been a large-scale test is yet to be confirmed. Regardless, the malware is capable of
doing significant harm to electric power systems and could also be refitted to target other
types of critical infrastructure.

Industroyer is a particularly dangerous threat, since it is capable of controlling electricity
substation switches and circuit breakers directly. To do so, it uses industrial communication
protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems,
and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).
These switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analogue switches;
technically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact
may range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious
damage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well.
Needless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning
of vital services.

Industroyer’s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were
designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and
back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their
communication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the
attackers didn’t need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach
the malware “to speak” those protocols.
The recent power outage occurred on December 17th, 2016, almost exactly one year after
the well-documented cyberattack that caused a blackout that affected around 250,000
households in several regions in Ukraine on December 23rd, 2015.
In 2015, the perpetrators infiltrated the electricity distribution networks with the BlackEnergy
malware, along with KillDisk and other malicious components, and then abused legitimate
remote access software to control operators’ workstations and to cut off power. Aside from
targeting the Ukrainian power grid, there are no apparent similarities in code between
BlackEnergy and Industroyer.

Structure and key functionalities
Industroyer is modular malware. Its core component is a backdoor used by attackers to
manage the attack: it installs and controls the other components and connects to a remote
server to receive commands and to report to the attackers.
What sets Industroyer apart from other malware targeting infrastructure is its use of four
payload components, which are designed to gain direct control of switches and circuit
breakers at an electricity distribution substation.
Each of these components targets particular communication protocols specified in the
following standards: IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process
Control Data Access (OPC DA).
Generally, the payloads work in stages whose goals are mapping the network, and then
figuring out and issuing commands that will work with the specific industrial control devices.
Industroyer’s payloads show the authors’ deep knowledge and understanding of industrial
control systems.

The malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under
the radar, to ensure the malware’s persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has
done its job.
For example, the communication with the C&C servers hidden in Tor can be limited to nonworking hours. Also, it employs an additional backdoor – masquerading as the Notepad
application – designed to regain access to the targeted network in case the main backdoor
is detected and/or disabled.
And its wiper module is designed to erase system-crucial Registry keys and overwrite files
to make the system unbootable and the recovery harder. Of interest is the port scanner that
maps the network, trying to find relevant computers: the attackers made their own custom
tool instead of using existing software. Finally, yet another module is a Denial-of-Service
tool that exploits the CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in Siemens SIPROTEC devices and can
render targeted devices unresponsive.

Conclusion

3/5

Industroyer is highly customizable malware. While being universal, in that it can be used to
attack any industrial control system using some of the targeted communication protocols,
some of the components in analyzed samples were designed to target particular hardware.
For example, the wiper component and one of the payload components are tailored for use
against systems incorporating certain industrial power control products by ABB, and the
DoS component works specifically against Siemens SIPROTECT devices used in electrical
substations and other related fields of application.
While in principle it’s difficult to attribute attacks to malware without performing an onsite
incident response, it’s highly probable that Industroyer was used in the December 2016
attack on the Ukrainian power grid. On top of the fact that the malware clearly possesses
the unique capabilities to perform the attack, it contains an activation timestamp for
December 17th, 2016, the day of the power outage.
The 2016 attack on the Ukrainian power grid attracted much less attention than the attack
that occurred a year earlier. However, the tool most likely used, Win32/Industroyer, is an
advanced piece of malware in the hands of a sophisticated and determined attacker.
Thanks to its ability to persist in the system and provide valuable information for tuning-up
the highly configurable payloads, attackers could adapt the malware to any environment,
which makes it extremely dangerous. Regardless of whether or not the recent attack on the
Ukrainian power grid was a test, it should serve as a wake-up call for those responsible for
security of critical systems around the world.
