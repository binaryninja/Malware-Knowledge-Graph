V3 Lite

July 21, 2022

The ASEC analysis team has discovered the distribution of malware disguised as a V3 Lite
icon and packed with the .NET packer. The attacker likely created an icon that is almost
identical to that of V3 Lite to trick the user, and AveMaria RAT and AgentTesla were
discovered during the last month using this method.

As shown in Figure 1, the icon looks almost identical to the actual V3 Lite icon.
AveMaria is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool) malware with remote control features that
receives commands from the C&C server and performs a variety of malicious behaviors. It is
usually distributed in the .NET packer form like AgentTesla, Lokibot, and Formbook to
bypass anti-malware detection.
Although the original name of AveMaria is WARZONE RAT, it sends the “AVE_MARIA” string
for authentication when performing a proxy connection with the C2 server, thereyby also
known as AveMaria.
Additional features of the malware and the analysis information of its binary can be found in
the AhnLab TIP Portal’s detailed analysis report and ASEC blog post.

While the malware is operating, winSAT.exe (Windows System Assessment Tool) and a
command for UAC privilege escalation using the winmm.dll file were found, which were
explained in the previous blog.

When the malware is run, it deliberately causes a delay with timeout.exe. It then performs
additional malicious behaviors by injecting a malicious binary into a normal Windows process
named RegAsm.exe. Figure 4 shows the malicious binary inside the process.

Besides AveMaria, the distribution of AgentTesla was also found. AgentTesla is an infostealer that leaks user information saved in web browsers, emails, and FTP clients. It is one
of the most prolific malware in terms of distribution, being constantly ranked high in the
ASEC Weekly Malware Statistics.

Upon using AhnLab’s infrastructure to check the related malicious files that use V3 Lite icon,
it was found that the distribution is done actively. Most of such malicious files are distributed
through attachments of phishing emails.
At the basic level, users should refrain from opening attachments in emails from unknown
sources and update the anti-malware program to the latest version to prevent malware
infection in advance.
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and blocks the malware above using the
aliases below.
