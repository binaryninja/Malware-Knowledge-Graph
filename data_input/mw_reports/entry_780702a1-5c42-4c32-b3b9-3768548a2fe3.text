SNAKEMACKEREL
A BREXIT-themed lure document that
delivers ZEKAPAB malware

SNAKEMACKEREL

As the United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Theresa May
announced the initial BREXIT draft agreement with the
European Union (EU), iDefense analysts identified a new
campaign by SNAKEMACKEREL using a BREXIT-themed
lure document to deliver the Zekapab (also known as
Zebrocy) first-stage malware.

WHAT’S THE STORY?
SNAKEMACKEREL is an espionage-motivated cyber threat group, also known as
Sofacy, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Fancy Bear, APT28, Group 74, Tsar Team, and Strontium.
Both the British and Dutch governments have publicly attributed SNAKEMACKEREL
activities to the Russian military intelligence service (RIS)1 and have linked specific
cyberattacks to the group, including the targeting of the Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)2, the United Kingdom Defence and Science
Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (FCO).
In foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyberattacks,
including attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors
“masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause
the victim to misattribute the source of the attack.”
According to the FBI, the SNAKEMACKEREL threat group "is part of an ongoing
campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the United States government and
its citizens. These cyber operations have included spear phishing campaigns
targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks,
universities, political organizations, and corporations, leading to the theft of
information.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
The creation of this malicious document, coming on the same day that the UK
government announced an initial agreed draft of the BREXIT agreement, suggests
that SNAKEMACKEREL is a group that pays close attention to political affairs and is
able to leverage the latest news headlines to develop lure documents to deliver firststage malware, such as Zekapab, to its intended targets. The theme also reflects the

targeting of the group which primarily focuses on NATO members, countries in
Central Asia and those neighboring Russia.
Given the assumed association with the Russian military service, it is clear that the
group has significant resources to target and compromise organizations. As a result,
it requires extra investment in defensive measures. To protect the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of business operations, Accenture Security recommends that
organizations ensure their staff members receive security hygiene training and deploy
intelligence-driven network and host-based defensive measures.

WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Despite the public reporting and government accusations, SNAKEMACKEREL remains
highly active. It is behind a large number of cyberattacks targeting global aerospace
and defense contractors, military units, political parties, the International Olympic
Committee (IOC), anti-doping agencies, government departments and various other
verticals. NATO and EU member countries, as well as the United States, are of
particular interest to the group.
SNAKEMACKEREL operations continue to be some of the most far-reaching and
sophisticated cyber espionage and intelligence campaigns to date.

HOW TO USE THIS REPORT
iDefense, part of Accenture Security, is providing information about this reported
SNAKEMACKEREL campaign to highlight the modus operandi of a highly active
threat group that is targeting institutions, presumably for espionage purposes.

INTENDED AUDIENCE
This intelligence alert is relevant for security operations center (SOC) analysts and
engineers, intelligence analysts and management, and executive leadership.

HOW TO USE THIS INTELLIGENCE
SOC analysts and engineers can use this alert’s detailed information pertaining to
the workings of the malware families and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to
contain or mitigate the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC
analysts can use the information provided in the analysis and mitigation sections
of this alert for hunting activities for systems that may have been compromised
already. Analysts and security engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to
hunting lists on Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, as well as
network- and host-based blacklists to detect and deny malware implantation and
command-and-control (C2) communication.
Intelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this alert to
better inform their own analyses. The information can also help inform ongoing
intelligence analyses and forensic investigations, particularly with respect to
compromise discovery, damage assessment, and attribution.
Management and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks
associated with the threat described to make the appropriate operational and
policy decisions.
Knowledge of SNAKEMACKEREL's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
helps to better inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
This report provides a technical overview of a BREXIT-themed lure Microsoft Office
document that is used to drop a Delphi version of the Zekapab first-stage malware
which has been previously reported by iDefense analysts. However, additional
research on the C2 server 109.248.148.42 revealed a new .NET version of Zekapab
that is designed for the same purpose.

MALWARE ANALYSIS
iDefense analysts recently came across the following malicious document that is
purportedly related to the recent BREXIT negotiations between the UK and the EU.
The file has the following metadata:
• Filename: Brexit 15.11.2018.docx
•

Research on the malicious IP address 109.248.148.42 revealed two different .dotm
components:
•

Filename: attachedTemplate.dotm

•

MD5: 018611b879b2bbd886e86b62484494da

•

File size: 1.5 MB (1612982 bytes)

•

MD5: 2a794b55b839b3237482098957877326

•

File size: 1.2 MB (1228358 bytes)

The two components are dropped from the following URLs respectively:
hxxp://109.248.148.42/office/thememl/2012/main/attachedTemplate.dotm
hxxp://109.248.148.42/officeDocument/2006/relationships/templates.dotm
Both components contain an identical VBA macro code as shown above, each
containing two different embedded payloads: one is an executable binary file and the
other is a .docm file.
attachedTemplate.dotm dropped the following:
•

Filename: ntslwin.exe

•

MD5: 7e67122d3a052e4755b02965e2e56a2e

templates.dotm dropped the following:
•

Filename: ntslwin.exe

•

•

File size: 384.0 KB (24659 bytes)

The second macro file ~de03fc12a.docm dropped includes a simple macro to
execute the dropped executable. The code snippet below shows the embedded
macro code:
Sub Proc1()
Dim vFileName As String
Dim add As String
vAdd = "ntslwin."
vFileName = Environ("APPDATA") & "\NetworkNV\"
vFileName = vFileName + vAdd & "exe"
Shell vFileName
Application.Quit
End Sub

Analysis into the two binaries shows that they are in fact a Delphi (initially UPX
packed) and .NET version of the Zekapab first-stage malware.
The following network traffic is performed by the Delphi sample which has the
following metadata once unpacked by UPX:
•

Filename: ntslwin.exe

•

MD5: f4cab3a393462a57639faa978a75d10a

•

File size: 984.5 KB (1008128 bytes)

Exhibit 4 shows the network traffic generated by the sample, a HTTP POST request
containing the system information collected. As shown, the data sent appears to be
URL encoded:
Exhibit 4. Network traffic from the Delphi version of Zekapab

On the other hand, the network traffic generated by the .NET version is unencoded
(see Exhibit 5).

SNAKEMACKEREL

Exhibit 5. Network traffic from the .NET version of Zekapab

Both versions are designed to collect system information and running processes and
send them to the designated C2 server using HTTP POST to the URI used in both
cases is /agr-enum/progress-inform/cube.php?res=.
If the system is deemed interesting, the next stage malware would be delivered into
corresponding directories.
The second-stage malware is delivered to different destinations with an autorun
registry key set respectively.
For the Delphi version, the following registry key and value are used for persistence:
Key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\AudioMgr
Value: %AppData%\Video\videodrv.exe
For the .NET version, the following registry key and value are used for persistence:
Key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\GoogleIndexer
Value: %AppData%\Platform\sslwin.exe
