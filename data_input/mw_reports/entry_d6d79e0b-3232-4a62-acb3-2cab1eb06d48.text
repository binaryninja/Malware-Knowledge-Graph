Preface
Many infrastructure security professionals have wondered as to what extent critical systems are
exposed to the Internet. That is how this project got started. No one within the project team had any
idea that they would encounter as much exposure as was discovered. The raw data that was
accumulated is potentially dangerous information. Thus, we felt that full disclosure of any specific
details about an infrastructure could be used as an attack vector against that infrastructure.
As the team has an ethical obligation to make the public aware of this situation, there were several
attempts to write this document in a reasonable manner. As outlined within the tale of the Emperor's
New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen, there is no nice way to publicly state what needed to be said.
The team is doing their best to discuss, with discretion and candor, a rampant problem of public
infrastructure exposure.
Should any organization, vendor, integrator, government, or individual decide to squelch this report, the
authors would like to point out that the data came strictly from publicly available sources, without any
subterfuge. This is a technical problem, not a legal problem. Using the legal profession to attempt to
silence this report will not address any problems identified here; it will only bring derision and ill will to
those who attempt to sequester either the authors, or this report, and will provide nothing to remove
any vulnerability or risk. Such efforts will merely discourage any future cooperative efforts.
Additionally, this may encourage people with similar technical backgrounds to take a less open approach
towards the infrastructure community.
The team was compelled to provide meaningful and relevant information from the project, outlined
within this report, without compromising either the asset owners or the manufacturers of those assets.
The authors did not create this problem.
This paper is a message.
We feel a community effort should begin somewhere, starting first with public awareness.

Introduction
There have been quiet rumors over the last decade that many control systems’ assets, such as remote
terminal units (RTU) or programmable logic controllers (PLC) related to infrastructure, were exposed to
the Internet. Information about the problem was speculative, as some have debated over whether or
not these assets were lightly configured, or if their scope of exposure to the Internet existed.
Many were curious about what and where these systems were. The problem is that, although the
methods of reaching out and touching these systems are not a secret, there was concern of liability.
With the myriad of legal systems around World, there is no way of knowing what any given court might
consider a hostile action, regardless of intentions.
Thus, a different approach became necessary.

What does “Lightly Configured” Mean?
Many control systems’ implementations are usually integrated on a very tight budget. It is generally
common practice that most integrators only configure SCADA/control systems to the extent necessary
to get these systems working. Many SCADA/control systems today have web (HTTP), file transfer (FTP),
network management (SNMP), or Telnet protocol features enabled by default – especially web servers.
This means that if one of these systems were accidentally exposed to the Internet, it would probably be
found, if from nothing else, a web page generated by the system’s internal web server.
It is reasonable to assume that most search engines (Yahootm, Googletm, etc.) have probably discovered
these devices. All anyone would have to do is to design a very selective query to find these systems.

Exposure to the Internet
Assuming that anyone could identify unique key words that could single out these systems, and
assuming that anyone could remove duplicates from domain name server (DNS) aliases, it should be
possible to find these systems on the Internet. The initial thought that the team had was to use any
search engine, de-duplicate their addresses by running a reverse DNS lookup, then store everything
indexed by IP addresses and search terms.
This approach has two interesting and frightening traits:
(1) The scanning has already been done. The researchers do not need to touch any system.
(2) The device owners have no way of knowing that they've been found. The only thing in their logs
(assuming such logs exist) would be a search engine spider. Anyone exposed to the Internet
should expect that much.
Initially, the team had no idea of the scope, or magnitude, as to how extensive this issue was.

Many things can disturb these sectors, but one very high-profiled method, is the use of computer
malware to attack or destroy these cyber assets. The likelihood of someone doing this that an
increasing number of these electronically-controlled devices are becoming known of being exposed to
the Internet, with the possibility that someone with criminal intent or a political agenda somewhere on
this planet might act against these devices is significant.
Development of a defense-in-depth strategy is crucial in securing these systems, as many systems which
were once connected through private or closed-loop communications networks, are now connected
through a public network. One speculative theory discussed over the years is that many private or
closed-loop networks have vanished and have been replaced with newer, more modern
communications equipment, in many cases, now directly connected to the Internet. Many organizations
either have little to no knowledge that their once privately-connected systems may now be directly
connected to the Internet, or may have little or no efforts ensuring that these systems are protected in
any manner whatsoever.

What is Project SHINE?
Project SHINE (“SHINE” is an acronym meaning “SHodan INtelligence Extraction”) was created to
extrapolate metadata from the SHODAN search engine, which is a custom search engine designed for
searching embedded devices (routers, servers, etc.) or computer systems based on a searchable term
criteria set, returning service port header information. Some have also described it as a search engine of
service banners in which metadata is enumerating and identified using these embedded devices or
computer systems, providing additional metadata information such as contained within the following
data sets:






IP address of the device;
Location (including latitude and longitude coordinates, if available);
Country of origin;
Owner of the IP address; and,
Service port header information.

Header information may be useful in identifying information such as (but not limited to) metadata
containing the following:





Protocol type (e.g.; HTTP, SNMP, Telnet, etc.);
Version and/or firmware release levels;
Content expiration date and time; and,
Other lesser known metadata values that may be directly correlated to other forms of metadata
which can be utilized as aggregated data, allowing differentiation of various manufacturers of
devices/software, but may use similar software and/or firmware.

Any of this metadata information may be considered of great value for a number of purposes.

Project SHINE attempted to discover if any specific organizations that were discovered by SHODAN, but
to our dismay, found that majority of the IP addresses were found to be leased from Internet Service
Providers (ISP), and acquiring any such additional information from those ISPs would be next to
impossible, as this would violate privacy issues with the ISP’s clients; we tried on several occasions in
contacting one of the responsible ISPs for several dozen SCADA/control systems devices found directly
connected to the Internet, inquiring the asset owner’s name and were unsuccessful in our attempts.
SHODAN’s information may be considered extremely valuable when attempting to discover embedded
devices or computer systems that an organization may own that are directly connected to the Internet
in an effort to protect their cyber assets from either tampering, manipulation of data (either input
and/or output from said device), loss of integrity of its operation, disruption of service to its operation,
or worse yet, total destruction of said device and/or any services or other operations relying upon said
device.
On the other hand, the SHODAN search engine provides an easy one-stop shopping place to conduct a
potential open source intelligence gathering capability to which either target a non-specific location (for
instance, all embedded devices or computer systems operating within the United States), or a slightly
more specific location (for instance, the Eastern Region of the United States), to specific organizations,
or to specific devices (that may be utilized by one or more organization), provided of course, that the
location data is accurate. This metadata may be utilized against any one of the parties outlined above
for purposes not previously disclosed; yet, however, many may be able to ascertain that those reasons
may include several purposes considered as an act of terrorism against either the United States or
friendly countries aligned with the United States. Nonetheless, having such a tool available, and if
sufficient knowledge may be obtained, has the potential to cause and wreck havoc against not only
private infrastructure asset owners but public sectored organizations as well.
This method of intelligence gathering is often described as “open source intelligence” (or “OSINT”)1, and
has been revitalized as a renewed method for gathering and collecting intelligence metadata. In most
circumstances, open source collection methods are used to compare and aggregate against closed
source collection methods; thus, utilizing the publicly available open source metadata to provide a
comparative analysis against an existing state or function of a given system or environment, allows such
correlation to reduce and remove any errors that may exist from the metadata collected. This provides
a very powerful and useful tool when conducting such research; however, open source intelligence
sources are not always accurate, and thus, is an issue when relying solely upon an open source as the
only method of gathering and collecting metadata intelligence.

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence gathered and collected from publicly available sources. Within the intelligence community,
the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources); this term is not related to open-source
software or public intelligence. Open-source intelligence under one name or another has been around for many years. The significance of
OSINT today, both within the United States (and abroad) is the conflict between military, government, and the private sector intelligence
gathering methods as to how the bulk of intelligence should be obtained. With the Internet, instant communications, and advanced media
search of bulk metadata that can be easily obtained through actionable and predictive methods from public, unclassified sources. Government
agencies have been slow to embrace OSINT, or believe they have suitable information feeds from the media, academia and public records.

One the other hand, if comparative analysis can provide deterministic data modeling, and thus reduce (if
not remove) any extraneous metadata that was considered incorrect or erroneous in nature, this can
provide a useful tool that is relatively cheap in terms of cost and resources utilized.
A search engine performs regular interrogations (scanning) of embedded devices and/or computer
systems found throughout the World; it harvests metadata pertaining to them, and ingests the
metadata into massive databases. Information is sorted based on a criteria set (as outlined on the
previous page) and periodically interrogated by the search engine for any modification. Some devices
will often show multiple scanning interrogational activities, indicating that the search engine is verifying
that the device scanned is still online and available.
At no point during the activities of Project SHINE did we ever perform any scanning, or attempt to
directly access any of the embedded devices and/or computer systems connected to the Internet.

Concerns with Project SHINE
Some of our concerns from our findings may include (but may not be limited to) the following:









Lack of knowledge of devices contained within their own operations;
Lack of knowledge of how to secure their devices within their own operations, or organizations
may know, but are may not perceive the potential risk costing more than the mitigation;
Requesting constant confirmation of asset owners’ IP addresses against the Project SHINE’s
metadata database (indicating perhaps adherence to a compliance-driven model);
Justification that, if no IP addresses are found within the Project SHINE metadata database, that
devices are not connected to the Internet, and that the asset owners’ operations are clear from
any potential attack, threat or vulnerability;
Asset owners’ devices could potentially be quietly compromised by a forgotten backdoor left
behind by a third-party contractor, as no one would know if it existed;
Expectation that Project SHINE will share, either partially or in its entirety, the Project SHINE
metadata extracted from the SHODAN search engine; and,
Expectation that Project SHINE will share one (or more) of any search term(s) from the criteria
set used to extract metadata from the SHODAN search engine.

Many of these concerns appear to be directly correlated to a compliance-based model (as opposed to a
risk-based or consequence-based model), ensuring that an asset owners’ operations is in adherence
with whatever regulatory body/organization may exist for that industry, or if no regulations exist, ensure
stockholders are assured of no impacts to their operations (thus, potentially devaluing the asset owners’
stock prices). In either case, (observationally) this raises concerns that asset owners are not willing to
secure their environments unless they are specifically told to do so (legally required by the regulatory
body/organization or through their stockholders). Many asset owners will often perform security
upgrades only if it is absolutely necessary, or if something severe were to occur (e.g.; such as an
explosion or a leak of a toxic substance).

One observation appears to be consistent with more than one critical infrastructure (and its industries),
further re-enforcing any potential liabilities that their environments are secure, or that the lack of
knowledge of being capable of performing such tasks to secure their operations, and if required to
secure their operations, often utilizing external resources to perform such tasks, may potential create
risk of any third-party representative to introduce additional risks (e.g.; such as performing an act of
sabotage, introducing hidden “backdoors”2, etc.) into their operations.
Some industries have recently considered either utilizing a consequence-based model3, or some form of
hybridized modeling methodology involving consequence-based modeling and some other form of
modeling (with the exception of compliance-based modeling). The use of consequence-based modeling
may be considered difficult in terms of predictability; nonetheless, several infrastructure sectors (and
their respective industries) are considering such actions, as the compliance-based modeling
methodology may be insufficient – more importantly – too costly, to effectively provide a secured
methodology for the enterprise and its respective systems. Reasons for switching to utilizing such
modeling methodologies may be due to costs, time, resources, or some form of combination thereof, as
some feel that compliance-based modeling (overall) may be too expensive for long-term expenditures of
an organization’s capital funding, and may impact the overall net worth value of the organization. Such
considerations are being evaluated today, as return-on-investments (ROI) appear to be flattening out
due to increased expenditures in several aspects, which may include factors such as security based on a
compliance-based model.

Role and Function of Project SHINE
Project SHINE was created with the intention of defining a searchable term criteria set metadata
database that could be modified easily to establish a census baseline of all SCADA/control systems
discovered through the SHODAN search engine via the Internet. The project is solely dependent upon
the SHODAN search engine. Some of the problems that we have encountered through the project
include (but are not limited to):




Downtime of the SHODAN search engine (both announced and un-announced);
Disk space availability of data within the SHODAN database; and,
Devices (possibly) repeatedly discovered via SHODAN with different IP addresses.

2

A “backdoor” in a SCADA, control system, computer system, et. al is a method of bypassing normal accessing methods (secured or otherwise),
ensuring unauthorized access to a given system, while attempting to remain undetected for access to that system.
3
Consequence-based modeling is used to determine consequential impacts of a given system based upon an event or incident, either
intentional or accidental, and the effects resulting following the event or incident. Such a model may be used to provide predictive analysis
utilizing specific criteria sets based on scenarios conducted that are used to determine such outcomes. While there may be high interest in
utilizing an alternative modeling methodology, the use of consequence-based modeling may be difficult to implement, while providing useful
outcomes, as many factors used for the model may be dynamically changing, thus making such predictive analysis equally as difficult.

The whole premise behind the project was to perform and demonstrate the following:




The ability to selectively perform searches from one (or more) definable, searchable term
criteria sets from (one or more) open intelligence sources;
To correlate data into meaningful abstractive and relevant data that could be utilized to
demonstrate further trending and correlation analysis based on the data given; and,
To seek a baseline of just how many SCADA/control systems devices exist on the Internet (as of
the conclusion of Project SHINE on 31-Jan-2014, we were unable to establish a baseline from
which we could compare rates of growth).

It was our hope that we would be able to ascertain a baseline of devices discovered using the SHODAN
search engine, and then measure any changes as the number of devices grew or shrank over a period of
time. As the project was never able to accomplish this goal, we were not entirely certain why this was
the case. Henceforth, this was the primary reason why Project SHINE was discontinued on 31-Jan-2014.

Search Term Selection
The crux of this exercise was choosing a search term that identified control systems devices. The team
was looking for not just control systems, but also any infrastructure that supports it. For example, an
uninterruptable power supply (UPS) is often a component of operations control centers. Generator
controls and transfer switches were also common support elements. Serial port servers were
commonplace with many control systems, as are certain brands of networking switches.
There are also certain keywords (such as MODBUS, PROFINET, etc.) that are often a search term for
snagging devices that might otherwise have been missed. For example, a networking switch with a web
interface that mentions IGMP snooping (e.g.; used with Ethernet/IPtm) is probably a control systems’
switch. However, there are many switch models and it is easy to overlook one.

Data Artifacts
Clearly, there will be other matches that are not related to an actual infrastructure. There may be
demonstration units, used for marketing or testing purposes. Some units won't be counted because
manufacturer's names change as firms are bought and sold all the time. Other devices may be
spuriously counted because the same embedded code may be used by multiple manufacturers.
Also note that several search terms may apply to the same device. For example, an RTU with the ability
to act as a MODBUS master might trigger on the search terms of the RTU make and model, as well as
the search term of MODBUS.

This method depends upon the “lightly configured” assumption, that from a first-hand experience, the
team knew that this assumption is more than likely. However, it is assumed that there may be a few
asset owners who may actually tighten up their configurations once discovered.
One consideration is that many devices are hidden behind network address translation (NAT) firewalls.
It should not be unexpected that multiple search terms indicating different devices might be radiating
from a single address. This is why the team made no effort to de-duplicate addresses with different
search terms. Thus, a “hit” is an address that has a search term discovered. Multiple hits on a single
address are not only possible, but actually somewhat likely.
Because of these limitations, this study is only intended as a gross first order estimate of the scope of
the problem. The reader of this report should not infer too much detail into the data presented here as
it is based upon assumptions that are probably not as solidified as one might like.

Found Discoveries
The team had to spot-check some of the discoveries, mostly to verify that the search terms were picking
up what was sought. These spot-checks consisted of plugging a sample IP address in to the location bar
of a web browser. In most cases, something responded back. Occasionally, such interrogation would
yield graphics that would identify who the owner of the unit was. Unfortunately, due to the sheer
volume of responses, checking every IP address was impractical.
Another discovery should have been obvious from the start: the team attempted quite a few reverse
address lookups. Many of the hits led to dynamically assigned ISP addresses. In other words, it was
almost impossible to know from the address alone what something belonged to.
Nevertheless, the Project SHINE stumbled across some interesting things: mining equipment, a
surprising number of wind farms, a crematorium, a few water utilities, several substations, and many
innocuous accessories that are commonly used for control systems, such as serial port servers, UPS
equipment, HVAC systems, etc.

What is SHODAN?
Unlike most traditional search engines (such as Googletm, Yahootm or Bingtm), the SHODAN search engine
is a very custom and specialized search engine that lets users find specific types of embedded devices
and computer systems (routers, servers, etc.) using a variety of filters and searchable terms (criteria
sets) that are directly connected to the Internet. Several individuals have defined this search engine as a
specialized search engine that harvests and ingests metadata from service banners. Service banners can
provide some relevant information about the type of device or software being utilized, what version of
software or firmware exists, and if there are any conditions or flags that currently exist, often indicating
limitations of the embedded devices or computer systems scanned as to its functionality, identify any
possible options that the service supports, perhaps a welcome message or anything else that the client
would like to know before interacting with that embedded device or computer system. More
importantly, what makes SHODAN important is, based on the software or firmware levels identified can
help determine any potential vulnerability which may exist for these embedded devices or computer
systems; this is (probably) the most significant reason of concern for the SHODAN search engine. This
was recently demonstrated when the “Heartbleed”4 vulnerability was identified in early April 2014,
utilizing SHODAN as one method of identifying systems through a openly public venue that were
vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability.
The name “SHODAN” is a reference to the “Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network”
(“SHODAN”)[5]and is a fictional artificial intelligence with the main antagonist of the cyberpunk-horror
themed action role-playing video game series called System Shock and System Shock 2.
The search engine began as a side project for John Matherly who determined that it would be
interesting in determining how many embedded devices or computer systems were connected to the
Internet. SHODAN users are able to find systems of all types including (but not limited to) devices such
as traffic lights, security cameras, home heating systems, control systems for water parks, gas stations,
water plants, power substations, and much more.
This is both a positive and negative aspect of the SHODAN search engine in that – depending on its
users’ intent – may be construed as either a tool (positive) or as a weapon (negative). The fact is,
SHODAN may not necessary be the problem for devices discovered and harvested by the search engine;
however, it makes its availability of metadata that (otherwise) was not publicly or openly available as
now a freely available tool for adversaries with a one-stop location to perform surveillance and
intelligence gathering methods against (perhaps) a specific target or organization.

Heartbleed is a security bug within the open-source OpenSSL cryptographic library, which is widely used to implement the Internet's Transport
Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This vulnerability, classified as a buffer over-read, results from a missing bounds check in the handling of the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension, the heartbeat being behind the bug's name.

What Service Ports does SHODAN Look For?
Normally, SHODAN harvests and ingests metadata information from several service ports:




File Transfer Protocol (FTP) – port 21
Telnet (TELNET) – port 23
Unsecured Web (HTTP) – port 80

●
●
●

Secured Shell (SSH) – port 22
Simple Network Mgmt Protocol – port 161
Secured Web (HTTPS) – port 443

On a concerning note, there have been several discussions from several media sources, blogs and public
forums indicating whether or not the SHODAN search engine is or will locate other service ports or
banners from lesser known protocols. This, too, can be considered useful for both positive and negative
reasons.
Recently, there have been five (5) SCADA/control systems ports discovered that are scanned and
metadata collected by the SHODAN search engine, which include:




Siemens SIMATIC / ICCP – port 102
DNP3 – port 20000
BACNet – port 47808

●
●

MODBUS/TCP – port 502
Ethernet/IP – port 44818

For example, if additional service port information were included that provided commented header
information relevant to a specific company name (e.g.; “CoGen, Inc.”), location of the plant or base of
operation (e.g.; “Western Region Pump Location A-11, City of Metdata, Metadata County, US”), function
of the operation (e.g.; “Waste Extraction Unit #3, Pump #102”), this could provide additional
information that adversaries could now have available at their fingertips. Through this method, they
wouldn’t need the IP addresses (or address range) to quickly determine what or who was their target or
organization, and with some further analysis, could ascertain functions, roles, or perhaps, even the
individuals responsible for the now recently identified operations. All of this is openly, freely and
publicly available via SHODAN.
One note that we would like to point out, are that the service ports of the SCADA/control systems
scanned by SHODAN, are not used solely by SCADA/control systems, as those services ports are utilized
by other non-SCADA/control systems specific functionalities. These service ports have been defined for
other service-specific roles and functions pertaining to network operations within an enterprise or
Internet-connected systems.

Results from Project SHINE: Manufacturers
Some statistics of SCADA/control systems, as well as embedded device manufacturers are shown below.
Breakdown is based on manufacturer’s name, and count of number of search term criteria sets for each
manufacturer, along with a globalized count, an adjusted globalized count based on redundancies, an
adjusted globalized count based on manufacturers that do not fall under traditional SCADA/control
systems manufacturers, and their redundancies.
Redundancies would be search term criteria sets in which there are globalized search terms, along with
more specific search terms, based on model number, or some other relevant data that would make the
search term more unique. Information is provided in tabular format, and shown on subsequent pages.

Manufacturer Results
As of the end of the project on 31-Jan-2014, we have discovered (roughly) 927 search term criteria sets
that the project has monitored since the project’s inception on 12-Apr-2012.
Approximately 886 search term criteria sets were considered as unique search terms (“<manufacturer>”
[non-unique] versus “<manufacturer>+<specific device>” [unique]), and removing what some might
consider non-traditional SCADA/control systems, reduced the count to (roughly) 578 total.
There are a total number of 207 manufacturers monitored, and with the reduction of non-traditional
SCADA/control systems, reduces the count to (roughly) 182 manufacturers total; a difference of 25
manufacturers who might not be considered traditional SCADA/control systems manufacturers.

Although the total number of manufacturers monitored may appear to be paltry in its count in
comparison to the total of manufacturers in the information technology industry, the number of
manufacturers is by no means complete, as there are thousands of manufacturers who specialize in
SCADA/control systems in some fashion thereof.

Those manufacturers, who were discovered, were found through several sources, such as trade
magazines, blogging web sites, etc. The premise behind the project was to gauge, through sampling,
any trending (if any) of the total number of devices discovered through the SHODAN search engine.
The project was started with the notion that eventually the team would notice that the harvesting
process was not occurring at a rate seen initially. When that point was reached, one could presume
most of the assets had been discovered.
Unfortunately, that didn't happen. There were two reasons for this. First, it was presumed that
whatever was found wouldn't be removed from service any time soon and new exposures wouldn't
happen quickly. This would be wrong. Second, search terms were being added frequently all
throughout the project. Even when examining individual search terms, there appeared to be no leveling
off of the rate of ingestion. Some of this problem may have been an artifact of SHODAN's data
gathering methods being quite irregular, not having been designed for this purpose. Nonetheless, our
efforts proved unsuccessful, as the project was unable to obtain a baseline.

One reason for listing HVAC/building automation control systems is this is a potential attack vector for
accessing other assets. This is an emerging attack vector6, as many asset owners often incorporate their
building automation control system environments with the remainder of the enterprise as: (1) a
convenience of utilizing the enterprise to access these devices; and (2) as asset owners have not
conceived this as a potential threat vector:




Target Corporation (February 2014)7 – target was the point-of-sale environments, with an
estimated number of approximately 70 million credit cards potentially compromised;
Google Australian Division (May 2013)8 – target was disruption of the enterprise environments
by researchers; there was no damage, as the devices controlled HVAC environments only; and,
Carrell Clinic (July 2009)9 – target was disruption of the enterprise environments, and obtain
patient record information by a former employee; no patient records were compromised.

Results from Project SHINE: Serial-to-Ethernet Converters
Some statistics of SCADA/control systems are broken down based on SCADA/control systems that are

An issue that many asset owners fail to understand is that serial-to-Ethernet converters provide an easy
attack vector for accessing SCADA/control systems devices, often camouflaged as something else. One
method of spotting a given device utilized for SCADA/control systems are two (2) communications
protocols provided by many serial-to-Ethernet converters: (1) RS-48510; and (2) DF111.
RS-485 is used as the physical layer underlying many standard and proprietary automation protocols
used to implement SCADA/control systems, including the most common versions of MODBUS and
PROFIBUS. This protocol may be used to control video surveillance systems or to interconnect security
control panels and devices such as access control card readers, etc. DF1 (alt. “DF-1”) is an asynchronous
byte-oriented protocol that is used to communicate with most Allen Bradley / Rockwell Automation RS232 interface modules. The DF1 protocol consists of link layer and application layer formats. Link layer
serial frame is a composition of conventional RS-232 serial frames with parameters specified as 8 data
bits, no parity, and a maximum baud rate of 19200.

Results from Project SHINE: SCADA/Control Systems Ports
Some statistics of SCADA/control systems are broken down based on SCADA/control systems portspecific protocols. Data acquired from the SHODAN search engine confirms that SHODAN is periodically
scanning and collecting metadata for these protocols. The results on a daily basis (ingested into Project
SHINE) is inconsistent; therefore, any and all relevant metadata presented was taken entirely (as a
sample as of 31-Jan-2014) from the SHODAN search engine.

SCADA/Control Systems Port Results
As of 31-Jan-2014, there are five (5) ports currently being scanned and metadata collected for
SCADA/control systems specific devices, which include:




Siemens SIMATIC / ICCP – Port 102
DNP3 – Port 20000
BACNet – Port 47808

Graphical representations are presented in 2 different graphics/pages: (1) top five (5) countries; and (2)
total count (with percentage difference) for all countries captured from SHODAN, proceeding in
ascending port number order, starting with port 102 (Siemens SIMATIC / ICCP).

Background Regarding the SCADA/Control Systems Protocols
SCADA/control system information and command processing is distributed across multiple stations
which are connected through a local area network (LAN). Information is shared utilizing network
protocols that were still not standardized. These protocols are considered manufacturer-proprietary.
There are several dozen manufacturers of these proprietary protocols; however, the SHODAN search
engine is scanning and ingesting metadata for five (5) popularly used protocols.

Siemens / ICCP (Port 102)
Port 102 is primarily used by Siemens Corporation to administratively control their SIMATIC control
systems (which is based from the RFC 1006 design). Areas of application include: (1) remote
programming; (2) ISO-on-TCP connections; and (3) S7 connections via Industrial Ethernet.

MODBUS/TCP (Port 502)
MODBUS TCP/IP is a variant of the MODBUS12 family of simple, vendor-neutral communication protocols
intended for supervision and control of automation equipment. Specifically, it covers the use of
MODBUS messaging in networked environment using TCP/IP protocols. The most common use of these
protocols is Ethernet-attached devices such as PLC's, I/O modules, and other field buses or I/O networks.

DNP3 (Port 20000)
The Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)13 is a set of communications protocols used between
components in process automation systems. Its main use is in utilities such as electric and water
companies; usage in other industries is not common. As it was developed for communications between
various types of data acquisition and control equipment, this protocol plays a crucial role in
SCADA/control systems, where it is used by SCADA master stations, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and
Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). It is primarily used for communications between a master station
and RTUs or IEDs. ICCP, the Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (a part of the IEC 60870-6
protocol), is used for inter-master station communications.

Ethernet/IP (Port 44818)
The EtherNet/IPtm14 protocol is an industrial Ethernet network that combines standard Ethernet
technologies with the media-independent Common Industrial Protocol (CIP). EtherNet/IPtm is one of
several industrial Ethernet network protocols utilized throughout the world, and is widely used in a
range of many industries including manufacturing, hybrid and process control. The EtherNet/IPtm and
CIP technologies are managed by ODVA, Inc., a global trade and standards development organization
founded in 1995 whose 300+ corporate members are comprised of the world leading automation device
suppliers.

BACNet (Port 47808)
The BACNet is a communications protocol for building automation and control network, and is an
ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO standards15 protocol.
BACNet was designed to allow communication of building automation and control systems for
applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control, lighting control, access control,
and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACNet protocol provides mechanisms
for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular
building service they perform. Proper communication between building automation devices is critical
for maximizing building energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and other aspects of "green"16
buildings.[17][18][19]

Results from Project SHINE: Master Counts
Some statistics of SCADA/control systems were broken down based on SCADA/control systems master
counts since Project SHINE’s inception on 14-Apr-2012. Data acquired from the SHODAN search engine
confirms that there are gaps in counts throughout the period sampled; the sampled count data taken
was between 14-Apr-2012 through (and including) 31-Jan-2014. Some of these gaps may include:





The SHODAN search engine was unavailable for maintenance reasons (scheduled outage);
The SHODAN search engine was unavailable for unexplained reasons (un-scheduled outage);
Networking errors/issues with Project SHINE’s network (ISP outage); or,
Erroneous conditions within the Project SHINE application during its initial development.

Over the past several years, SHODAN has undergone several modifications, and has been unavailable
(usually) during late-night timeframes. As the search engine application has been modified over the
years, the number of un-scheduled outages has reduced significantly in number.

SCADA/Control Systems Master Count Results
There are 654 entries from 14-Apr-2012 through (and including) 31-Jan-2014. This includes two fields:


Graphical representations are presented in 2 different graphics/pages: (1) search terms found (per day);
and (2) total count (per day) captured from SHODAN, proceeding in ascending port number order,
starting with 14-Apr-2012 onward; the last day ingested is 31-Jan-2014.

Results from Project SHINE: Counts by Country
Some statistics of SCADA/control systems are broken down based on country. Data acquired from the
SHODAN search engine is then compared against a geographical locator. Graphical representations are
presented showing the top twenty-one (21) countries; these countries are identified by their total count
that is above 20,000.

Country Summarized Results
Of the twenty-one (21) countries identified, the top five (5) countries represent 53.48% against the
remaining countries identified (bolded text), with the United States’ count at 616,994, slightly double
with the next highest country, Germany, at a count of 280,248; combined, both the United States and
Germany represent 49.08% of the top twenty-one (21) countries identified, with respect to 41.03% of all
211 countries identified.

Lessons Learned from Project SHINE
One of the purposes of this document is to outline some of the practices that lead to trouble. This
discussion of security is not exhaustive. In fact, Mr. Radvanovsky and Mr. Brodsky have co-edited an
entire handbook on the subject (it will not be reproduced here).
First, from the spot-check cases the team has studied, most exposures appear to be accidental. In other
words, it is the result of poorly configured network infrastructure. The asset owners may not realize the
problem until perhaps someday someone takes the time to locate the asset owners to advise them that
their infrastructure is exposed. Of course, it is also entirely possible that someone with ill intentions will
find such assets first.
This is one very strong reason to avoid the practice of lightly configuring equipment.
Contrary to the practice of lightly configuring devices, anything not absolutely necessary should be shut
down. For example, serial port servers are one of the secret work-horses of many SCADA/control
systems. The use of such devices is almost unavoidable. It is not wise to leave all configurations to the
defaults it came with. Thus, turn off the web interface; turn off SNMP; turn off the Telnet interface; turn
off the configuration interface (e.g.; is there really a need to dynamically reconfigure the serial interface
remotely?) Then, use firewalls and virtual private network (VPN) appliances to block traffic from any but
those places that absolutely must be able to “see” these devices.
When scanning industrial protocols, it is important to consider whether something is configured to
respond automatically to a query. Most industrial protocols will yield some results, but not all.
For example, some DNP3 implementations are not easily interrogated if one does not know the
addresses to use. Unfortunately, many system integrators start with low addresses and work their way
up. Scanning for the first 10 addresses may yield many DNP3 devices. However, the address space goes
all the way to 65519. Choosing “random” addresses in the middle of the address space, such as 10548,
would make finding a DNP3 RTU difficult. Furthermore, many RTUs can be configured to respond to
only a handful of master addresses. Make those addresses obscure and these devices will be
moderately difficult to find even if the IP address is known. Some will argue that this is “security
through obscurity” -- but it is at least effective enough to keep such devices out of common search
engines. The DNP Users Group has application notes that further discuss this issue in greater detail.
From a perspective of project integration, there probably should be policies, if not laws, outlining each
and every default password and service an embedded device has. At some point in which the project’s
implementation is turned over to the customer, there needs to be a documented ceremony identifying
each and every such device and account. After it is turned over, the customer should be responsible for
changing every single account except perhaps those previously agreed to for warranty remote access
assistance by the implementer.

Too many devices appear to have such default accounts in them. Once these practices become known,
it then becomes possible to scan the Internet for them. This is one very strong reason to stop building
back-doors (such as factory-based passwords) into products. The authors feel that such undocumented
“back-door” accounts should not be legal for use within critical infrastructure applications.
Some sought to use Project SHINE as a compliance tool. There is no way this can work. Project SHINE
data does not indicate who the site belongs to, and even if Project SHINE does find something belonging
to an asset owner, there is no guarantee that anyone can use that data to trace back to the owner.
Often the exposure appears to happen accidentally. For example, someone configures a firewall and a
VPN through that firewall to another site. Then one day, there is a problem with the connection.
What's the first thing a technician would do? Possibly remove the VPN from the equation. Do they
bother to restore it? Not always.
During validity checks, the Project SHINE team found what appeared to be translated addresses from
behind a firewall. There were entire local area networks there waiting to be hacked. It is important to
keep in mind that hiding behind a firewall with a single data concentrator is no guarantee against a
determined effort to expose a site. Once the data concentrator is compromised, everything else behind
it is at risk. Do not assume that a data concentrator can protect anything.

Conclusion
The Project SHINE team presents this data in the hope that individuals (and their organizations) might
begin to understand the sheer scope of this problem. New regulations and legislation are needed to
curb this behavior. Industry practices need to be modified. Diagnostic practices and configuration
management schemes need to improve dramatically.
It is worth noting that many of these sites may technically be in compliance with regulatory -- only
because the asset owners have no idea that they really are exposed. The industry must get past this
terrible practice of compliance-based security and focus instead on an attitude of safety, vigilance, and
performance awareness.
Within the community of aviation, there is a catch-all regulatory clause warning pilots against “careless
and reckless” operations (14 CFR 91.13). This is the regulation that the United States Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) uses when pilots do something that everyone should have been aware of -- even
though there may not have been explicit regulations against it. There is no analogous regulation for any
other industry, particularly electric utilities. As an industry, the community needs to break this terrible
“compliance” based approach towards security, and instead use a catch-all phrase somewhat similar to
what the FAA has done for pilots. Doing so will put a stop to a many ignorant and dangerous practices
that are presently getting the World at large into trouble.
