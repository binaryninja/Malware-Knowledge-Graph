Did Russia's GRU military intelligence service pay the Taliban bounties to kill American
military personnel in Afghanistan? It's unclear. The intelligence community has given neither
former President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden a high confidence assessment that
such incidents occurred. But that's not the end of the story.
For the CIA in particular, this is very much an open matter.
Primarily responsible for the collection of human intelligence, the CIA has moderate
confidence that a compartmentalized unit of the GRU did indeed pay bounties for the explicit
purpose of killing Americans. I'm led to believe that the CIA's basis for this assessment has
five key foundations.
First, information gathered from detainee interviews and related U.S. military operations in
Afghanistan.
Second, detected financial flows between the GRU, its intermediaries, and Taliban officers.
Third, highly sensitive and reliable reporting from agents (human sources) inside and outside
of the Taliban network (some of this reporting is so sensitive that the CIA delayed sharing it
with America's closest foreign partners).

Fourth, assessment of the GRU's established covert actions in Afghanistan. It has previously
been established with high confidence, for example, that the GRU has supported active
combat Taliban elements with funding, explicitly anti-U.S. tactical guidance, and weaponry.
Fifth, Vladimir Putin's particular ideological animus for the United States and historic animus
over 1980s U.S. actions against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. At least under its current
chief, Igor Kostyukov, the GRU is a near-perfect physical manifestation of this antiAmericanism (in the coming days, I will report on another case of the GRU's exceptionally
aggressive anti-U.S. activity).
In contrast, both the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, despite
sharing the CIA's concerns over Russia's intelligence activity in Afghanistan, lack the
independent intelligence reporting to corroborate the CIA's bounty assessment. The NSA is
particularly relevant as pertaining to the intelligence community assessments previously
given to Trump, and now, to Biden.
The NSA casts a wide net in terms of signal (phones, cyber, computers, etc.) intelligence
collection targeting the Russian government. Were the bounties story legitimate, the NSA
believes it would have intercepted, or at least detected, communications relating to such
bounties. An important point to note here is that the NSA believes this, in spite of known
Russian efforts to disrupt and misinform NSA collection activities. On the most sensitive
Russian intelligence operations (as any bounties payments for American bodies would
obviously be), Russian operatives take great pains to avoid communication not simply with
Moscow but also with their relevant embassy stations. They do so not simply to avoid being
caught but to avoid being caught up in the NSA's exceptionally capable metadata mining and
profiling software. From Putin on down, Russian officials also regularly share fictions on
encrypted lines they believe the NSA may have penetrated.
Top line: I understand that the NSA does not currently have evidence of GRU officers
credibly talking about paying the Taliban to kill Americans. Nor does the NSA have more
tangential data-based evidence, such as detection of burner cellphones used by
compartmentalized GRU officers in proximity to burner cellphones used by Taliban officers
responsible for U.S.-targeting efforts (this contrasts, for example, with the NSA's dead-torights evidence against the Russian FSB in the aftermath of its bungled August 2020
assassination attempt against Alexei Navalny).
This separation between the CIA and NSA is important. To guard against groupthink and
confirmation bias (see weapons of mass destruction, circa 2003), the NSA must base its
intelligence assessments on its own collection activities, not on what it wants to find.
This leaves the bounties story as an open case that lacks the evidence to justify presidentiallevel policy responses.
