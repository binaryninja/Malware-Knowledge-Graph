This month, the developer behind the popular npm package 'node-ipc' released sabotaged
versions of the library in protest of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.
Newer versions of the 'node-ipc' package began deleting all data and overwriting all files on
developer's machines, in addition to creating new text files with "peace" messages.
With over a million weekly downloads, 'node-ipc' is a prominent package used by major
libraries like Vue.js CLI.

Protestware: Ukraine's ongoing crisis bleeds into open source

Select versions (10.1.1 and 10.1.2) of the massively popular 'node-ipc' package were
caught containing malicious code that would overwrite or delete arbitrary files on a system
for users based in Russia and Belarus. These versions are tracked under CVE-2022-23812.
On March 8th, developer Brandon Nozaki Miller, aka RIAEvangelist released open source
software packages called peacenotwar and oneday-test on both npm and GitHub.
The packages appear to have been originally created by the developer as a means of
peaceful protest, as they mainly add a "message of peace" on the Desktop of any user
installing the packages.
"This code serves as a non-destructive example of why controlling your node modules is
important," explains RIAEvangelist.
"It also serves as a non-violent protest against Russia's aggression that threatens the world
right now."
But, chaos unfolded when select npm versions of the famous 'node-ipc' library—also
maintained by RIAEvangelist, were seen launching a destructive payload to delete all data
by overwriting files of users installing the package.
Interestingly, the malicious code, committed as early as March 7th by the dev, would read
the system's external IP address and only delete data by overwriting files for users
based in Russia and Belarus.
The code present within 'node-ipc', specifically in file "ssl-geospec.js" contains base64encoded strings and obfuscation tactics to mask its true purpose:

users (BleepingComputer)
A simplified copy of the code provided by researchers shows that for users based in Russia
or Belarus, the code will rewrite the contents of all files present on a system with a heart
emoji—effectively deleting all data on a system.
Additionally, because 'node-ipc' versions 9.2.2, 11.0.0, and those greater than
11.0.0 bundle the peacenotwar module within themselves, affected users saw 'WITH-LOVEFROM-AMERICA.txt' files popping up on their Desktop with "peace" messages:

Researchers at open source security firm Snyk also tracked and analyzed the malicious
activity:
"At this point, a very clear abuse and a critical supply chain security incident will occur for
any system on which this npm package will be called upon, if that matches a geo-location of
either Russia or Belarus," writes Liran Tal, Director of Developer Advocacy at Snyk in a blog
post.

Vue.js users panic over supply chain attack
Popular JavaScript front end framework 'Vue.js' also uses 'node-ipc' as a dependency. But
prior to this incident, 'Vue.js' did not pin the versions of 'node-ipc' dependency to a safe
version and was set up to fetch the latest minor and patch versions instead, as evident from
the caret (^) symbol:

Versions of Vue.js CLI previously pulled latest minor and patch versions of node-ipc
As such, Vue.js CLI users made an urgent appeal to the project's maintainers to pin the
'node-ipc' dependency to a safe version, after some were left startled.
And, as observed by BleepingComputer, Vue.js isn't the only open source project to be
impacted by this sabotage.
Developers Lukas Mertens and Fedor are warning other project maintainers to make sure
they are not on a malicious 'node-ipc' version:

Snyk researchers suspect that 'node-ipc' versions 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 that cause blatant
damage to the system were taken down by npm within 24 hours of publication.
Note, however, 'node-ipc' versions 11.0.0 and above remain available on npm. And,
these versions still contain the peacenotwar module that will create the aforementioned
'WITH-LOVE-FROM-AMERICA.txt' files on Desktop.
As such, if your application is built using the 'node-ipc' library, make sure to pin the
dependency to a safe version such as 9.2.1 (turns out 9.2.2 isn't innocent either).

Incident upsets open source community
This marks the second major incident of protest by an open source developer this year,
following January's 'colors' and 'fakers' self-sabotage incident, as first reported by
BleepingComputer.
In the case of 'colors', its developer Marak Squires drew mixed reactions from the open
source community because his manner of protest involved breaking thousands of
applications by introducing infinite loops within them.
However, the move by RIAEvangelist, who maintains over 40 packages on npm, has drawn
sharp criticism for going beyond just "peaceful protest" and actively deploying destructive
payloads in a popular library without any warning to honest users.
A GitHub user called it "a huge damage" to the credibility of the whole open source
community.
"This behavior is beyond f**** up. Sure, war is bad, but that doesn't make this behavior (e.g.
deleting all files for Russia/Belarus users and creating strange file in desktop folder)
justified. F*** you, go to hell. You've just successfully ruined the open-source community.
You happy now @RIAEvangelist?" asked another.
Some called out the 'node-ipc' developer for trying to "cover up" his tracks by persistently
editing and deleting previous comments on the thread [1, 2, 3].
"Even if the deliberate and dangerous act of maintainer RIAEvangelist will be perceived by
some as a legitimate act of protest. How does that reflect on the maintainer’s future
reputation and stake in the developer community?" asks Snyk's Tal.
Developers should exercise caution before using 'node-ipc' in their applications as there is
no assurance that future versions of this or any library released by RIAEvangelist will be
safe.
Pinning your dependencies to a trusted version is one of the ways of protecting your
applications against such supply chain attacks.

That was really bad. Even if (almost) the world is against Russia, coding malware to
target anyone using it there is not a protest, but a crime.
There'r better ways to protest and even affect them, if that is the point, but without
doing shady stuff.

I support that developer
The worst are those who just watch and do nothing !

And thus we see the downfall of open source. When developers of popular projects
prove that open source isn't reliable, corporate use will start to dwindle as they move
back to closed source software and API's, because they know that closed source
commercial software developers aren't going to intentionally sabotage their own
products.

Can’t wait for the Danooct1 video about this in a few years.

Absolute worst way to take a stand.
They haven't considered that IP geolocation isn't necesarily accurate.
All my ISPs main servers are in a similar region to me yet my IP geolocates to another
region like 1000KM away.

My internet is terrible and managed to double post without even submitting the form
twice or reloading the page.

So if you're worried about node-ipc not doing the job, try out hyper-ipc, its a p2p
replacement for ipc things, I welcome anybody to help me improve it, I have been
using it over a year for more than 10 mission-criticial apps.
The secret sauce that p2p gives you is you can run IPC inside containers WITHOUT
FORWARDING PORTS!, and you can also move them from computer to computer
with no IP reconfiguration.

Program-technical or hacker aggression is also a weapon of mass destruction that
can cause real software and technical destruction, lead to collapse, murder and
suicide. Therefore, such scum of humanity must be judged as severely as for murder.

I don't support war, but this makes me sad. Hope he will go to jail for this!

So it's a free software, and OSS.
Every one can see all changes any release can bring.
Noone forced anyone to use it.
Every bad and lazy developer uses unchecked version declaration and upgrades. And
want to blame there own stupidity on the Library publisher.
Look at the code you are importing into your app.
Anyone has issues with OSS, go write your own code. It's good for economy, will
create more jobs .
The OSS developers have ruined IT market by creating softwares free of cost. Every
company should stop using OSS immediately, and start written or buying closed
sourced products.
What, your company can't afford it? Cuts into its profit?

I think NPM must take serious action about this kind of behaviour, They must ban any
cyber criminal from the platform
