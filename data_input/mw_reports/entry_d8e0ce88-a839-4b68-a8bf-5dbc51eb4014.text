Another scary note is the date in the VM used in the screenshot consistently appears to be
January 21st, 2022. If this date is correct, this would suggest @okta failed to publicly
acknowledge any breach for at least two months.
LAPSUS$ used off-the-shelf tooling from GitHub for the majority of their attacks. After
downloading Process Explorer and Process Hacker, LAPSUS$ bypassed the FireEye

LAPSUS$ was able to create backdoor users in Sitel's environment after retrieving an Excel

The LAPSUS$ ransomware group has claimed to breach Okta sharing the following images
from internal systems.

The screenshots are very worrisome. In the pictures below, LAPSUS$ appears to have
gotten access to the @Cloudflare tenant with the ability to reset employee passwords:

We can see how LAPSUS$ originally began investigating their compromised host on
January 19th, 2022. With little regard for OPSEC, LAPSUS$ searched for a CVE-202134484 bypass on their compromised host and downloaded the pre-built version from GitHub.

Rant about how @Bugcrowd and @Hacker0x01 setup their platforms to let vendors who
host private programs abuse researchers. Entirely based on a true story with @Bugcrowd in
my case. This is for my #bugbounty friends out there. 1/n
LAPSUS$ finished off their attack by creating a malicious "email transport rule" to forward all
mail within Sitel's environment to their own accounts. 6/N docs.microsoft.com/en-

New documents for the Okta breach: I have obtained copies of the Mandiant report detailing
the embarrassing Sitel/SYKES breach timeline and the methodology of the LAPSUS$ group.

My questions for Okta: You knew that the machine of one of your customer support members
was compromised back in January. Why didn't you investigate it? Having the capability to
detect an attack is useless if you aren't willing to respond. 7/N
Even when Okta received the Mandiant report in March explicitly detailing the attack, they
continued to ignore the obvious signs that their environment was breached until LAPSUS$
shined a spotlight on their inaction. 8/N
For the Sitel Group: Why weren't your customers immediately informed upon the first sign of
compromise? Why did your customers have to wait two months to even hear that you were
breached? 9/N

Sitel Group serves many more customers than Okta. Often times, for support staff to perform
their jobs, they need Administrative privileges into their customer's environment. The attack
highlights the increased risk of outsourcing access to your org.'s internal environment. 10/N
Good questions to ask include: Who knows how your sub-processors handle their own
security? As we saw in this case, Sitel didn't take the security of their environment very
seriously. What can an attacker do if one of your sub-processors becomes compromised?

Would like to clarify some misconceptions I've seen. No, this data is not attorney-client
privileged. None of what I shared is from my organization and it was obtained entirely
independently. I did not break any NDA/contract. 13/N
