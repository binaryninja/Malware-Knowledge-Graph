Do you want to become a ninja for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? We can help you get
there! We collected content for two roles: “Security Operations (SecOps)” and “Security
Administrator (SecAdmin)”. The content is structured into three different knowledge levels,
with multiple modules: Fundamentals, Intermediate, and Expert. Some topics can be relevant
for SecOps as well as for SecAdmins and are listed for both roles. We will keep updating this
training on a regular basis and highlight new resources.
In addition, after each level, we offer you a knowledge check based on the training material
you have just finished! Since there’s a lot of content, the goal of the knowledge checks is to
help ensure understanding of the key concepts that were covered. Lastly, there’ll be a
fun certificate issued at the end of the training: Disclaimer: This is not an official Microsoft
certification and only acts as a way of recognizing your participation in this training
content.
If you already did the training, you can focus on the latest updates (August 2021
update)
