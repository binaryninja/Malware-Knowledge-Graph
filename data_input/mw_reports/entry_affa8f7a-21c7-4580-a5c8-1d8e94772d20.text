About Threat of the Month Series
With the rise of cyberattacks, it’s impossible for security and IT teams to keep track of
every one. We’ll identify an emerging cybersecurity threat and give information on
what it is, why it’s becoming more prevalent, and how you can prevent it.
The Threat of the Month blog series is a collaboration between Cerium Networks and
Blumira.
This month’s threat is IcedID (aka BokBot) a strain of malware that initially operated as a
banking trojan but has now evolved into something far more dangerous: an initial access
broker for ransomware threat actors.
The first half of 2021 alone has been a record-breaking time period for ransomware, during
which six ransomware groups have compromised 292 organizations, according to an
eSentire report. The report estimates that these attacks generated at least $45 million for the
groups.
So, what does IcedID have to do with ransomware? The threat actors that are deploying
ransomware aren’t usually the ones deploying IcedID in the wild.
The threat actors behind IcedID typically launch a mass email campaign. Once IcedID has
gained a foothold into an environment, the malware threat actors sell that initial access —
which often includes reconnaissance intel such as the number of endpoints in the targeted
organization, network range, and potential access points — in a cybercriminal marketplace.
Ransomware-as-a-service affiliates will purchase the initial access which they use to launch
the ransomware attack.

The evolution of IcedID from a banking trojan to an initial access broker means that financial
institutions are no longer the only target. Any organization that doesn’t have malware
prevention in place can be a potential victim.

How Does IcedID Work?
Threat actors have used a few different methods to deploy an IcedID campaign, and as with
most cyberattacks, these methods are always evolving — making IcedID more difficult to
detect.
In some campaigns, threat actors use rigged Excel spreadsheets as a delivery mechanism.
Threat actors typically use a naming convention that prompts victims to open it, using
language such as “refusal,” “claim,” and “overdue.” Users that open the file will see a screen
instructing them to enable macros to see the full version.

Once macros are enabled, the malicious formula embedded in the Excel sheet will execute.
Malware developers often use white font on a white background to make the formula
invisible to victims. Macros on the sheet then download three DLL files with the .dat
extension from the command and control servers.
More recent IcedID campaigns involve threat actors using contact forms on legitimate
company websites to send emails with malicious links. With this method, the emails that
arrive in a victim’s inbox look trustworthy because they are sent using email marketing
systems. It’s possible that threat actors have used tools to automate the process and evade
CAPTCHA measures, according to Microsoft.
In one particular campaign, the email contained strong language and legal threats about
stolen photography, with links to site.google.com for the recipient to view the stolen photos.
Once a victim follows the link, which asks them to sign in with Google credentials, the site
will automatically download a zip file. This contains a malicious .js file that launches the
IcedID attack.

Why Now?
In January 2021, a coalition of eight international law enforcement officials brought down one
of the most widespread malware variants, Emotet. On April 25, 2021, government officials
uninstalled Emotet from all infected systems. Like IcedID, Emotet originated as a banking
trojan designed to steal sensitive information. Over the years, however, it morphed into a

more sophisticated strain of malware that evaded detection techniques and used command
and control servers to receive updates. It eventually became capable of downloading
secondary malware payloads, such as “Ryuk” ransomware.
The takedown of arguably one of the biggest players in malware created an opening in the
marketplace for cybercriminals to fill — and IcedID is primed to take its place.
IcedID isn’t the only initial access broker for ransomware gangs; other malware families such
as TrickBot and Qbot also deliver payloads for ransomware attacks. However, IcedID threat
actors have managed to fly under the radar, while strains like TrickBot are heavily monitored
by law enforcement.
A few signs have pointed to the rise of IcedID and its use within ransomware attacks. Threat
researchers reported a spike in IcedID activity in March 2021. IcedID was also used to
deliver Sodinokibi, MAZE and Egregor ransomware attacks.

How To Prevent IcedID
Organizations can do a few things to prevent IcedID. Deploying antivirus (AV) software may
seem like an obvious first step. Although more advanced solutions can be helpful, IcedID
uses sophisticated techniques like using a company’s contact forms to evade detection from
many traditional antivirus tools.
Deploy detection and response. A detection and response solution that alerts security and
IT teams about suspicious behaviors is typically more effective in preventing sophisticated
malware strains like IcedID than an antivirus software. Blumira, for example, comes with
prebuilt detections designed to detect behaviors that are associated with IcedID’s initial
access attack path — like running built-in Windows utilities or enabling macros.
Train employees to detect phishing. Nearly every IcedID campaign starts with a phishing
email, so employees that are able to detect these emails can prevent an IcedID attack
altogether. Security teams can educate employees about phishing in a few ways depending
on company culture, such as interactive quizzes, team meetings and casual discussions.
Disable macros. IcedID uses macros to download and execute its payload, so one step that
IT and security admins can take is to disable macros for Microsoft Word through GPO, as
this will have little to no business impact for most organizations. Enforcing any kind of macro
policy for Excel, while recommended, will require more aggressive planning.
