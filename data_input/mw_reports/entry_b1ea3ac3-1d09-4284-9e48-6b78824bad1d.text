New Analysis: The CaddyWiper Malware Attacking Ukraine

1/9

As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, new wiper malware has surfaced attacking
Ukrainian infrastructure. Caddywiper was first detected on March 14, 2022. It destroys user
data, partitions information from attached drives, and has been spotted on several dozen
systems in a limited number of organizations. CaddyWiper has been deployed via GPO,
suggesting the attackers had initially compromised the target's Active Directory server.
Morphisec Labs’ CaddyWiper analysis follows.
CaddyWiper is the fourth wiper observed attacking Ukrainian targets. WhisperGate was the
first wiper. It was used in attacks on Ukrainian government agencies ahead of the invasion.
WhisperGate was soon followed by HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper, with CaddyWiper the
third wiper deployed in as many weeks.

Technical Analysis
Main Functionality

2/9

If the computer that CaddyWiper was executed on is not a domain controller (DC), the
machine won’t be harmed. If it is a PDC, Caddy starts wiping at “C:\\Users” in order not to
break the operating system before the wiping process completes. It then deletes every drive
letter from “D:\\” drive to “Z:\\”. If Caddy was run with administrator privileges, it also deletes
the partition of the physical hard drives to absolutely wreck the operating system.
The below text describes this flow:

Dynamic API Loading
Caddy uses the process environment block (PEB) to resolve the required Windows
application programming interface (API). This is to evade static and dynamic scanners. As
part of reputation scoring, scanners validate for an executable import directory, and dynamic
monitoring is based on imported API hooking. Caddy officially declares only on the
DsRoleGetPrimaryDomainInformation API as part of its import address table (IAT) while the
rest is resolved dynamically via the PEB.

File Wiping
The function wipepath is responsible for the actual wiping process of a file. This function can
handle hidden and system files while additionally acquiring discretionary access control to
the file in path. This is to ensure as many files as possible are wiped. It wipes a maximum of
a 10MB chunk from the beginning of the file as part of performance optimization.
See below the wipepath function:

Discretionary Access Control
The wiper changes the DACL of a file object by taking ownership of that object. This only
succeeds if whoever starts the Caddy process has WRITE_DAC access to the object or is
the owner of the object. If the initial attempt to change the DACL fails, the code enables the
privilege of ‘SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege.’ It then makes the local system's administrators
group the owner of the object. The code used in Caddy is similar to the example that MSDN
provides.

5/9

Partition Wiping
The IOCTL (‘IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX ‘) passed in DeviceIoControl is
generally used for disk repartition according to the specified drive layout and partition
information data. However, in our case, it just wipes 0x780 bytes from the physical drive
while it iterates from “\\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE9” and goes until “\\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0”.
However, it can only be done if Caddy is executed with administrator privileges.

The Impact

6/9

CaddyWiper can be executed with or without administrator privilege. In both cases it causes
lethal damage to the target machine. CaddyWiper execution without administrator privileges
makes files worthless, as seen below:

And when CaddyWiper starts with administrator privileges, it makes the operating system
useless as well:

7/9

Caddy is a sophisticated wiper that can transform any machine it’s deployed against into a
very expensive door stopper. Unfortunately, traditional endpoint security solutions have a
hard time preventing sophisticated attacks such as CaddyWiper. Due to its evasive,
polymorphic nature, CaddyWiper hides its functionality from runtime monitoring and pattern
matching. Though the impact is visible, response time is irrelevant when it gets to wipers or
ransomware.
Reactive and static antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
need augmentation to prevent APTs and lower the risk of breaches, lawsuits, fines, and
brand damage. Morphisec provides this additional defense layer and virtual patching with
Moving Target Defense (MTD) technology. MTD creates a dynamic attack surface threat
actors can’t penetrate, causing them to abort attacks. To learn more about Moving Target
Defense, read the white paper: Zero Trust + Moving Target Defense: Stopping Ransomware,
Zero-Day, and Other Advanced Threats Where NGAV and EDR Are Failing.
