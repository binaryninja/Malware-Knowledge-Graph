ZEROING IN ON XENOTIME: ANALYSIS OF THE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE... SLOWIK

ABSTRACT
The 2017 Triton or TRISIS event targeted safety systems at an oil and gas processing facility in Saudi Arabia. Although all
available evidence indicates the attack likely failed in its overall execution, the incident stands out as the first attempted
cyber event that contained the possibility for direct harm or loss of life. While gathering headlines for some months after
the incident was publicly revealed in late 2017, further reporting on the actor responsible – referred to as XENOTIME –
appeared to dry up, leaving many unanswered questions.
Matters changed in 2022 with a combination of some very broad industry reporting and the public release of a US
Department of Justice indictment from 2021 identifying a specific persona behind the Triton incident. While adding some
context around the group, many questions remain unanswered, not the least of which being what this entity (or its
component organizations) has been up to since 2017.
This presentation will delve deeper into the specific entity (or perhaps more plausibly, entities?) responsible for the 2017
event, and the implications of this association. While earlier reporting identified a specific research institution as linked to
the 2017 incident, an observation seemingly reinforced by the indictment, further analysis reveals that this entity likely
served primarily tool development, testing and research functions, leaving the actual perpetrators unidentified beyond
loose country association. By exploring technical, targeting and geopolitical factors surrounding the events in Saudi
Arabia, as well as discussing additional activity linked to this actor between 2018 and 2022, we will gain greater
understanding of just who XENOTIME might be and its implications for overall critical infrastructure cyber operations
since the Triton event.

INTRODUCTION
In 2017, a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia experienced multiple, unexpected, and (initially) unexplained shutdowns
[1]. Taking place in June and again in August 2017, multiple Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), also referred to as
Emergency Shutdown Devices (ESD), inexplicably tripped, inducing disruption in the industrial environment [2].
Subsequent investigation of the August incident revealed several interesting artifacts residing on a safety system
workstation, most notably a framework for surreptitiously interacting with Schneider Electric Triconex SIS devices –
ultimately given the name Triton [3].
Also referred to as TRISIS and HatMan, [4, 5] analysis indicated Triton was designed to enable an attacker to arbitrarily
– and silently – modify a Triconex SIS, enabling potentially catastrophic, and even deadly, outcomes. Yet initial reporting
provided little, if any, detail as to what entity was responsible for the incident in question. Further research (as well as
actions from the US government) linked Triton to a research institute in Russia, the State Research Center of the Russian
Federation Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) [6, 7].
Although undeniably linked to events in 2017, TsNIIKhM is an odd organization to engage in operations described by
some as ‘malware that can kill’ [8]. More significantly, aside from limited leaks and government actions, in five years no
further substantial events have specifically been identified and irrefutably linked to the adversary responsible for Triton,
referred to in commercial reporting as XENOTIME [9]. In this paper we will review the 2017 Triton incident, discuss
follow-on operations associated with the group responsible, and then explore what ‘XENOTIME’ plausibly means.
Through this examination, we will study the differentiation between developers and actors in cyber operations, and what
this means for incidents where visibility is limited, and multiple parties are likely at play.

THE TRITON INCIDENT
Based on multiple public disclosures, the Triton incident targeted the Petro Rabigh joint venture petrochemical facility in
Saudi Arabia [1]. Interestingly, the plant disruptions took place several times, resulting in facility shutdowns – but not
something more catastrophic given that SIS devices were the attacker’s final targets. Based on the capability deployed (a
multi-part framework to quietly and arbitrarily modify safety logic in industrial environments) and the effects achieved
(plant shutdown), a disconnect seems to exist as the latter effect could be more easily attained via other, more direct
means.
As analysed previously [10], Triton likely represents an ambitious attempt to create a cyber-physical impact that
ultimately failed for reasons still not completely understood. Based upon public analysis and disclosure, XENOTIME
thoroughly compromised the victim environment, from initial IT breach and lateral movement [11], through entry into
the Distributed Control System (DCS) network and finally the safety network [1, 2]. Mechanisms used to facilitate this
vary, from custom-developed tooling unique to XENOTIME to variations of several public frameworks to achieve
persistence [11].
Irrespective of specific methodology, the intrusion appears focused on ultimately modifying environment safety logic to
enable a physically destructive event, given the focus on safety controllers. While arbitrary modifications to the plant’s
DCS environment could prove disruptive, safety- and engineering-based mitigations, illustrated in Figure 1, can mitigate or
eliminate worst-case scenarios for physical process impacts and destruction.

Figure 1: Safety and engineering controls in industrial environments.
An adversary that desires an effective physical impact would need to eliminate or otherwise disable SIS and related systems
for a DCS modification to propagate to the physical environment and cause an impact. Reviewing the Triton incident
considering these details, the most likely scenario pursued by XENOTIME was a dual-track intrusion: compromise and
modification of facility SIS, to allow for subsequent modifications or disruptions in the plant’s DCS to propagate through
the safety layer to induce a physical impact. While engineering controls still exist beyond SIS devices, these nonetheless
result in potentially dangerous outcomes such as emergency venting of product or triggering relief mechanisms.
Overall, Triton represents only a part of a broader, ambitious sequence of actions to produce a cyber-physical impact
scenario. Outlined in Figure 2, XENOTIME planned and executed multiple actions across several distinct network
segments before reaching a point where Triton itself could be deployed.

Figure 2: Triton attack stages and actions.
And yet, for all this complexity, the intrusion arguably failed in achieving the likely objective as described above. Rather
than allowing XENOTIME to modify logic on the Triconex devices, Triton instead caused these devices to trigger a plant
shutdown. While disruptive (and expensive), this scenario pales in comparison to the much more frightening possibility of
an incident resulting in facility damage or even potential injury or death to on-site personnel.
While the precise reasons for Triton’s failure are unknown, public analysis indicates a potential mismatch between the
Triconex hardware and firmware combination used in the victim facility and the platform against which Triton was built
[12]. Another, more likely explanation is a post-exploitation action immediately after Triton execution that triggered the
controller crash [12, 13], although analysis from Mandiant and others failed to identify such a payload during post-incident
investigation. Irrespective of why Triton largely failed, the framework triggered an immediate disruption of plant operations
instead of the more nefarious action of enabling arbitrary modification to safety logic and other SIS functionality to induce
a cyber-physical impact scenario.
We therefore see something of a paradox: an adversary patient enough to conduct a prolonged, multi-stage intrusion,
capable of developing and deploying a malware framework with very specific (and alarming) functionality, but somehow
incapable of correctly developing or executing this capability for the victim environment. XENOTIME presents itself as a
conundrum – one that we will now analyse in greater detail.

IDENTIFYING AN ENTITY
Approximately one year after the public disclosure of Triton, researchers from Mandiant identified and detailed links
between the intrusion and Russia-based TsNIIKhM. Specifically, several enabling tools identified in the victim environment
were observed in an unspecified malware testing environment linked to a persona Mandiant linked to TsNIIKhM based on
open-source research [6]. Additional observations, such as file metadata, correlating time of activity to standard working
hours in Russia, and a possible username identified in observations potentially linked to a likely TsNIIKhM employee,

suggested at minimum links to a Russian entity. Overall, while a case could be made linking Triton (and potentially
XENOTIME) to TsNIIKhM, initial evidence (where presented) appeared largely circumstantial and incomplete at this time.
Matters changed significantly in 2020, when the US Department of the Treasury’s (USDT) Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) sanctioned TsNIIKhM, specifically for its involvement in enabling the Triton event [7]. While adding the weight of
government confirmation to Mandiant’s prior analysis, the press release detailing sanctions noted responsibility ‘for building
customized tools that enabled [the Triton] attack’. A savvy reader will notice the Treasury statement does not assign
responsibility for building Triton, or for using the malware in the victim environment, to TsNIIKhM. Instead, the USDT
OFAC statement appears to mirror Mandiant’s findings, linking TsNIIKhM to enabling tools used during the Triton incident.
Further details emerged in March 2022, when a 2021 indictment from the US Department of Justice (DOJ), United States v.
Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh, was publicly disclosed [14]. This indictment specifically identified a TsNIIKhM employee,
Gladkikh, and unidentified co-conspirators as responsible for the actual operations leading to the deployment of Triton (as
well as actions against an unspecified oil and gas entity in the United States, discussed in greater detail below). Again,
responsibility for Triton’s development is left unsaid. At this stage, TsNIIKhM’s association with Triton and subsequent
activities tracked as XENOTIME is well established, but specific details regarding event execution and responsibility
remain fuzzy.
Looking at the institute in question more closely, TsNIIKhM was founded in 1894 initially for development and
manufacture of smokeless powder for the Russian empire [15]. Since that time, the institute has diversified operations into
a variety of fields while remaining linked to Russia’s Ministry of Defence (MOD). As noted by both Mandiant and DOJ
reporting, identified individuals linked to Triton are connected to a specific entity housed within TsNIIKhM: the Applied
Development Center (ADC). ADC’s (now offline) website notes roles in critical infrastructure protection including
references to potential cyber operations [16], with DOJ emphasizing concurrent, non-public roles in offensive tool research
and development [14]. Overall, TsNIIKhM’s operations remain oriented toward supporting Russian security, military, and
related interests, with ADC appearing to be a particularly sensitive entity within the organization.
TsNIIKhM presents itself as a logical entity to research, develop, and create a tool such as Triton given the organization’s
mission as a research institution and its history supporting Russian military endeavours. Operationally, one may look at the
entity as similar to government-funded laboratories with strong military or intelligence connections elsewhere. Yet where
matters become confusing are the distinctions between tool development, tool prepositioning, and final tool deployment.
While TsNIIKhM appears a reasonable entity to satisfy the initial stages, having a research institute (even if under Russian
MOD sponsorship) actually undertake the infiltration of Petro Rabigh (and other organizations) appears very odd. At first
glance, DOJ’s indictment appears only to blame TsNIIKhM (and ADC) for deploying Triton (via Gladkikh), leaving
development (presumably a function aligned with ADC’s mission) unmentioned and unattributed.
Yet specific language in the DOJ indictment leaves some room for interpretation: ‘Gladkikh and co-conspirators known and
unknown to the Grand Jury, including TsNIIKhM and members of TsNIIKhM and ADC.’ [17]. While Gladkikh,
specifically called out as an employee of TsNIIKhM working in ADC, is directly identified, other involved parties remain
unnamed – not an unprecedented action, but odd for a specific ‘name-and-shame’ action from the US government. The
implication here is that entities aside from Gladkikh are involved, and while operational matters may link directly to
Gladkikh, developmental efforts could reside with other, unnamed parties that reside within the same organizations.
Furthermore, DOJ’s 2021 indictment uses the word ‘including’, leaving open the possibility that other entities or
organizations beyond TsNIIKhM were involved in the Triton event and subsequent activities. Several possibilities emerge
here, from the Russian MOD (through various intelligence entities under Russian military intelligence, also referred to as
the GRU) participating in operations to other, non-military but state intelligence-linked bodies contributing to intrusions (or
delivering operational tasking to TsNIIKhM and ADC).
Adding detail to XENOTIME’s involvement, the DOJ indictment presents a timeline of actions linked to Gladkikh and his
co-conspirators that also is intriguing. Actions specifically attributed to the individual include:
• Initial access to the Triton victim’s IT network.
• Research and exfiltration of data related to Triconex SIS operations in the victim environment.
• Deploying and executing the custom version of CryptCat initially flagged by Mandiant as a link to TsNIIKhM.
• Pivoting into the operational technology (OT) network at Petro Rabigh via a dual-homed data historian, then migrating
from this system to an engineering workstation connected to the victim’s safety network.
• Two specific attempts (02 June and 04 August 2017) to install variants of Triton on Triconex devices, resulting in faults
then system shutdowns.
Notably absent from the above list of actions are the development and testing of Triton itself. While Gladkikh appears to be
the primary entity responsible for the Triton intrusion, the actual development of the ‘malware that can kill’ is linked to
some other, unidentified entity. Before examining this mystery, a review of subsequent operations linked to XENOTIME
– and by association, TsNIIKhM – is in order.

OPERATIONS SINCE 2017
Since the Triton event, the entity at minimum linked to, if not responsible for, the incident – referred to as XENOTIME by
Dragos, but also referred to as Temp.Veles by FireEye and Mandiant – has remained active. Four particular phases of
XENOTIME operation stand out given their focus and potential intention.
First, shortly after the Triton event and as documented by DOJ, XENOTIME (and Gladkikh specifically) engaged in initial
reconnaissance and access activity against a US-based oil and gas company [17]. Although resulting in no identified
disruption, or recognized attempt at a physically destructive event such as in the Triton incident, DOJ reporting indicates
significant, focused interest in critical aspects of US oil and gas infrastructure. Based on available information, at minimum
Gladkikh, and overall XENOTIME activity, sought to preposition within US critical infrastructure in the oil and gas sector.
While there are many potential reasons for doing so, such actions would be necessary precursors for enabling a future
Triton-like scenario within the victim systems.
In parallel with the above, researchers at Mandiant revealed a second intrusion linked to XENOTIME. Reported in 2019, it
is unclear when the intrusion took place, let alone the victim or even the industry in which the victim operates [11].
However, Mandiant reporting suggested that XENOTIME-linked activity continued overall tradecraft tendencies revealed
in the Triton incident (likely the work of Gladkikh), while adding additional capabilities and tools. Based on ‘multiple
Triton-related incident responses carried out by FireEye Mandiant’, the group continued its use of customized publicly
available tools (e.g. PLINK and CryptCat). One example, linked to XENOTIME operations through several commercial
malware repositories, was the malicious use of Net Square’s Netexec utility [18]. This software, which appears to no longer
be supported, is a remote command execution tool functionally similar to the Microsoft Sysinternals PsExec utility. The
publicly available binary essentially allows for remote access tool functionality in also implementing file transfer
mechanisms along with process manipulation. XENOTIME appears to strongly favour the use of such tools for initial
access and lateral movement activity, potentially to allow XENOTIME to ‘blend in’ with benign actions, or to obfuscate
attribution efforts.
Following the Triton incident and the two items detailed above in this section, XENOTIME appeared to take an interesting
turn from oil and gas targeting to researching electric utilities. Based on reporting from Dragos released in 2019,
XENOTIME initiated reconnaissance and target development operations against US-based electric utilities no later than
late-2018 [19, 20]. As noted in reporting and press interviews, none of the observed activity extended to active process
disruption or physical destruction. But, given the nature of the Triton event, such intrusions are deeply concerning as they
again represent the necessary preliminaries for such an act.
The trend of ‘probing, but not exploiting’ appeared to continue when comments from Dragos in 2022 indicated continued
XENOTIME-linked operations against liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, likely in the US [21]. Although emphasized as
initial access and survey operations, the identified activity would represent continued interest by XENOTIME in US critical
infrastructure operations, while also aligning with efforts to research but not (immediately) disrupt targeted networks.
Overall, as shown in the timeline in Figure 3, XENOTIME has remained active since the Triton incident in 2017. While the
nature of these actions largely aligned with preparatory or preliminary operations, the group’s history makes these items
causes for concern. Having previously deployed a capability likely designed to remove process safety from industrial
environments, even consequence-free efforts such as ‘research’ and ‘access development’ carry significant risk as initial
steps towards future, far more concerning actions.
Frustratingly, the specific motivations behind the Triton event are unknown, which limits our ability to understand just what
XENOTIME is tasked with achieving. As a Russian-linked incident targeting an entity in Saudi Arabia, the Triton event is
especially confusing considering geopolitical matters. During the Triton incidents and subsequent investigation in 2017,
Russia and Saudi Arabia engaged in significant diplomatic discussion leading to a variety of agreements and a state visit by
Saudi royalty in October 2017 [22]. While such agreements frayed not long after [23], a state-sanctioned destructive attack
against Saudi oil infrastructure during a period of intense diplomatic discussion seems incredibly odd – one reason why
some researchers were prompted initially to link the framework to Iran [24]. Alternatively, the intrusion may have desired a
pre-positioned capability to hold Saudi infrastructure at risk should such discussions fail. While making for interesting
discussion, no actual evidence exists to confirm such a scenario, leaving us with little to pursue this possibility.
Given multiple public and private parties linking the event to Russia, we can be reasonably confident in associating
XENOTIME to Russian entities, although based on targeting and other factors during the Triton event, links to overall
Russian policy and strategic interests appear strange. Nonetheless, XENOTIME sought a physically disruptive event that
could result not only in physical damage, but also direct harm to personnel onsite. Geopolitical motivations may remain
confusing in this event, given a lack of tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia compared to other areas such as Ukraine
that have been the victims of Russian cyber aggression, but the implications are indisputable for potential impact scenarios.
By expanding its targeting post-2017 to the US, XENOTIME shows a continued willingness (if not yet ability) to cause
havoc and potentially even direct harm. Considering these observations, a review of XENOTIME and its relationship to
broader Russian-linked hacking entities is helpful to determine just who this group may be, and how TsNIIKhM may (or
may not) fit in with the rest of Russian-directed offensive cyber operations.

Figure 3: Timeline of XENOTIME-linked actions.

ORGANIZATIONS AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
TsNIIKhM represents the ‘prime mover’ for Triton actions, based on analysis and reporting from multiple entities – but not
the only entity involved given the lack of specificity concerning development of Triton itself. Post-2017 activity becomes
murkier still, with primarily private entities – most notably Mandiant and Dragos – publicly identifying continuity from the
Triton incident to follow-on actions under the XENOTIME banner, especially against US-based critical infrastructure
entities. The very specific identification of Gladkikh and detailed accounting of specific actions taken by him (and
unknown co-conspirators) emphasizes an operational role for TsNIIKhM and its ADC component including in non-Triton
events [17], yet silence from other parties on TsNIIKhM’s role in actions post-2017, despite significant warnings (and
public identification of cyber operations groups) surrounding Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, stands out [25].
For context, TsNIIKhM is a research institution that resides (indirectly) under Russia’s MOD, via the Federal Service for
Technical and Export Control of Russia [26, 27]. As such, it would appear logical for activities linked to TsNIIKhM to
associate with other Russian military elements such as the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Main Center for Special
Technologies, Field Post number 74455 – also popularly known as ‘Sandworm’ [28, 29]. Sandworm is linked to multiple
disruptive operations, ranging from the NotPetya wiper event to the three electric disruptive incidents in Ukraine [25, 30,
31]. Given the group’s track record, it would appear a natural ‘fit’ for an attempted destructive operation in a petrochemical
facility – yet through multiple statements and actions condemning Sandworm, no entity has ever linked TsNIIKhM (or
XENOTIME activity) to Sandworm.
Russia’s MOD maintains an entire ecosystem of research institutes and related entities involved in various endeavours, and
none of these appear directly linked to supporting active operations such as those attributed by various parties to TsNIIKhM
and ADC [32]. TsNIIKhM appears to exist as just one of many organizations supporting various MOD operations and
research endeavours – but one notably linked to an attempted destructive cyber attack. Moreover, TsNIIKhM engaged in
precisely the operations one would associate with a military or espionage actor – initial access and capability execution,
such as in Triton or the 2017-2018 US oil and gas entity incident – while remaining unlinked in any detailed analysis from
where one would expect such an organization to be involved, in developing a capability such as Triton.
Furthermore, Russia’s MOD does not retain absolute control over the output of military- or defence-focused labs, nor are
they the only sponsor for such activity. As revealed in additional USDT sanctions, other facilities such as the Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)-linked Federal State Autonomous Scientific Establishment Scientific Research Institute
Specialized Security Computing Devices and Automation entity (SVA), and the public-private research entity ERA
Technopolis also provide critical support in cyber effects capability development to multiple Russian government entities
[33]. As outlined in the Treasury sanctions, these organizations provided material support to various Russian-aligned
entities, including GRU and SVR elements, across several campaigns.

Russia’s MOD and SVR are not alone either – in 2018, USDT sanctioned another state-sponsored research institute for
operational connections with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) [34]. Specifically calling out cyber operations,
USDT’s OFAC statement singled out the Kvant Scientific Research Institute for supporting offensive actions. Based on the
institute’s web page, Kvant specializes in a variety of computing tasks and development work, without specifically
referencing Russia’s FSB or other entities [35]. Unfortunately, lack of specific details prevents us from determining the
precise extent of Kvant’s ‘operational’ support to FSB actions, but this does hint that perhaps XENOTIME and TsNIIKhM
may not be as unique as initial assessments would indicate.
There thus appears to be a complex ecosystem of government-sponsored, government-aligned, and industry-linked entities
intimately tied to enabling Russian-linked cyber operations. Such organizations span the ‘hydra’ of Russian intelligence
services – FSB, GRU and SVR – although overlap or links between these entities appear limited to non-existent [36]. A key
unifier in USDT OFAC statements is a focus on supporting roles to these agencies though, as opposed to the very direct
position TsNIIKhM appears to be involved in through Gladkikh’s actions under ADC. Thus, something materially different
appears considering TsNIIKhM compared to other research organizations, where the organization’s ADC division serves
not just as a centre of expertise but also a potential reservoir of talent for operational purposes.
In comparison, SVA, ERA Technopolis, and (potentially) Kvant appear to be more traditional capability development
organizations. For example, leadership of the ERA Technopolis project falls under the prestigious Kurchatov Institute,
aligning it with overall Russian (military-directed) scientific pursuits [37]. This is in addition to more dual-use
organizations such as the civilian-military Advanced Research Foundation (ARF), specializing in a combination of
commercial and military research objectives [38]. Along with SVA and Kvant, the groups focus on developing and
deploying technologies to materially improve Russian military and defence performance. Overall, Russian government (and
military) investments have substantially increased across multiple ‘bleeding edge’ technologies, including cyber but
extending to artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, and strategic strike capabilities, which is unsurprising, except
when the researchers appear to step in front of operations as Gladkikh appears to have done.
Precisely why TsNIIKhM and its ADC element would extend beyond this traditional role to active involvement thus
represents a mystery. This mystery is extended to questions on what entity – MOD, GRU, or other – tasked TsNIIKhM to
execute Triton and follow-on XENOTIME operations. While the involvement of a quasi-government research institute in
significant cyber operations is hardly new (one can look at alleged examples such as the involvement of US national
laboratories in Stuxnet development [39]) the involvement in direct operations is unique. A theory postulating TsNIIKhM
research leading to the development of Triton itself would be easy to accept, but failing to make this attributive statement
while aligning intrusion and execution activity to a TsNIIKhM employee represents an oddity.

Figure 4: Overview of Russia-linked threat actors and support institutions.

OPERATORS AND DEVELOPERS
Modern, scalable cyber operations represent a complex interaction of tasks and functions. Whether described through
mechanisms such as the ‘Cyber Kill Chain’ [40] or through references to ‘digital quartermaster’ scenarios [41, 42], cyber

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE SEPTEMBER 2022

operations represent a division of labour between experts and professionals when conducted at any type of scale or
sophistication. In the case of Triton and follow-on XENOTIME events, an individual like Gladkikh may be intimately
involved in initial access and follow-on lateral movement activity, but to expect the same individual also to research,
develop and complete a tool such as Triton in parallel seems unreasonable, if not outright ridiculous. We thus need to
differentiate between actors and deployers, and developers and researchers, where tool-specific tracking (e.g. focusing on
Triton) differentiates from intrusion analysis and subsequent actions (post-2017 XENOTIME activity) [43].
XENOTIME, in this case, represents a curiosity – an entity linked to operational outcomes (breaching Petro Rabigh,
deploying Triton, probing various other networks) but not developmental tasks. As such, it would appear to align closer to
entities such as Sandworm or other Russian-linked cyber activity groups. But as a research institute, it would seem more
aligned with preparatory and tool development actions, as noted in public reporting around entities such as SVA and Kvant.
So from a researcher’s perspective, what is going on?
For the purposes of XENOTIME, we as researchers must question our ability to adequately identify just what this entity is
and who they are. While their involvement (when equating XENOTIME to TsNIIKhM) in the Petro Rabigh incident should
go without question now, following multiple researcher and government disclosures, subsequent acts begin to appear
murky. We must ask ourselves what distinctions exist between researchers, developers, deployers and actors. In the case of
Gladkikh, it appears there was a unification of capabilities, but follow-on events present concerns as the involvement of
Gladkikh (beyond the US oil and gas entity), TsNIIKhM, and the ADC division, remain unknown.
XENOTIME, essentially, may be an item adhering to strategic interests as opposed to a single, specific entity. In this sense,
XENOTIME becomes a placeholder for a broader, deeper campaign linked to Russian strategic interests to develop, deploy,
and enable critical infrastructure impacts. As such, TsNIIKhM is simply a vessel for certain actions, beholden to the
command and control of some other party – whether that party is the Russian MOD, or reaches all the way to Russian
national command authority, remains frustratingly unknown. Post-Triton actions tracked as XENOTIME may very well be
the actions of whatever entity tasked TsNIIKhM.
From a threat research and analysis perspective, we as analysts must increasingly accept and incorporate this division of
labour – even if the precise links and lines of authority remain obscured – into our analysis. XENOTIME represents one
element of what is likely a much broader campaign to research, subvert, and lay the groundwork for disrupting critical
infrastructure in multiple environments. Perhaps tool development resides with TsNIIKhM, or maybe this institute also,
through ADC, engages in operations – but overall, the organization is merely one piece in a much larger machine using
cyber actions to execute strategic goals.
Analysts must therefore diversify their understanding and expand their horizons. XENOTIME, while a useful moniker
and tracking item, is an artificial construct overlaid on complex inter-agency and cross-organizational actions that most –
if not all – organizations will have limited if any visibility into. From an attribution and tracking perspective, analysts
should therefore accept and embrace the limitations of collection and data sourcing to understand just what is revealed to
us, and what remains a mystery as we delve into development, tasking, and other relationships [44]. This is not to advise
leaving such actions alone, but rather a call to understand that our insight into complex operations, with unknown
sponsors and multiple executing intermediaries, represents a collection item well beyond the capability of all but the most
well-resourced government intelligence agencies. XENOTIME, therefore, is a variable – a placeholder collecting a variety
of actions, from Gladkikh to TsNIIKhM to the ‘unnamed’ entities in DOJ indictments, and not a unitary, specific, and
well-defined entity in the world.

CONCLUSIONS
The 2017 Triton incident represents a seminal moment in cyber operations, as this is the first (known) incident where a
threat actor sought to undermine fundamental process safety in a cyber-physical event. As such, Triton remains a critical
touchpoint in threat analysis and research, even if the attack likely failed in its objectives given the recorded results.
However, the entity (or entities) responsible, tracked under the moniker of XENOTIME, remained active beyond the
incident at Petro Rabigh. XENOTIME thus emerged as a persistent, concerning threat to critical infrastructure spanning
continents given the entity’s link to physically disruptive, potentially life-threatening outcomes.
Yet in grasping XENOTIME and understanding what this entity really ‘is’, we face a question – while direct relationship
with TsNIIKhM (and its ADC division) is convenient and helpful, further analysis of events reveals a far murkier picture.
While certainly possible, an organization such as TsNIIKhM engaging in offensive, potentially destructive operations on its
own accord is not merely curious, but ridiculous within the greater ecosystem of Russia-controlled cyber operations.
Instead, TsNIIKhM represents a player in a far wider game with multiple participants engaged in potentially destructive
operations for ends unknown.
For threat researchers and analysts, the above may appear as so much trivial detail, but a more robust understanding of how
complex cyber operations are conducted indicates ‘messy’ situations like Triton and XENOTIME are likely to be the norm
for future events. Looking at incidents, particularly those associated with state-directed operations, as a combination of
efforts across multiple entities reveals the truth of such events, as composites stretching from research institutes such as
TsNIIKhM to known elements such as GRU or SVR. While Triton and XENOTIME appear to subvert some of the

8

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE SEPTEMBER 2022

ZEROING IN ON XENOTIME: ANALYSIS OF THE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE... SLOWIK

expectations around these relationships, with ADC and Gladkikh engaged in very active operations, the underlying trend of
a division of labour remains.
XENOTIME thus represents less a monolithic actor than a composite of multiple stakeholders acting on the behalf of a
national command authority to subvert critical infrastructure functionality. Triton, as worrying as the event may be, could
be considered a preview of future operations as the entities subsumed under the XENOTIME label expanded their efforts to
multiple critical infrastructure entities. By understanding these relationships (and the dependencies they engender), we as
threat analysts and defenders can better appreciate the level of effort involved in such operations, and the need to
differentiate between the entities on the keyboard and who their ultimate masters may be.
