The Locky ransomware is back, spreading via a massive wave of spam emails distributed
by the Necurs botnet, but the campaign appears to be a half-baked effort because the
ransomware is not able to encrypt files on modern Windows OS versions, locking files only
on older Windows XP & Vista machines.
Locky's return to action is surprising but makes perfect sense. There have been numerous
clues hinting that the same group behind the Necurs botnet was also behind the Locky
ransomware, and more recently, the Jaff ransomware, which many have considered Locky's
successor.
As Necurs slowly switched to Jaff, the Necurs group stopped spreading Locky spam in May,
most likely preferring the newer Jaff ransomware instead of the older Locky.

Locky's return may be tied to Jaff's fall
1/8

The Necurs group's long-term plan was foiled last week after security researchers from
Kaspersky Labs found a flaw in Jaff's encryption routine and created a free utility to help
infected victims recover their files without paying the ransom.
This was unexpected, as researchers were never able to crack Locky's encryption method,
and many thought Jaff to be just as tough, if not harder.
Kaspersky's feat appears to have taken the Necurs group by surprise as well. As soon as
the free decrypter was made available, Jaff spam went down, and beginning yesterday, the
Necurs group started distributing Locky once more. This switch most likely happened
because Locky's encryption was never cracked, and operators have a better chance of
extorting ransom from infected hosts.

Windows DEP security feature mitigates new Locky variant
The new spam waves were detected by a large number of security researchers. All reported
that they had trouble infecting themselves on their test machines.
It was Cisco's Talos division that discovered why. According to the company's experts, the
Locky authors rushed to replace the decrypted Jaff version with Locky and made several
errors in their deployment.
"Upon further investigation, we determined that on systems running Windows 7 or later with
Data Execution Prevention (DEP) would cause the unpacker to fail," said Cisco Talos
experts. This means that only older OS versions such as XP and Vista are affected.
In their rush, the Locky authors most likely didn't notice this bug, as they put considerable
resources into the ransomware's distribution, something they might not have done if they
knew its ineffectiveness.

Locky spam accounted for 7.2% of all email spam
Cisco says spam for this new Locky variant accounted for nearly 7.2% of the Internet's
entire email spam traffic. That's an insanely massive spam wave for a ransomware that only
targets less than 10% of the entire Windows userbase.

Furthermore, this Locky version comes with minimal changes from the version researchers
spotted the last time, in May. This Locky variant still uses the LOTPR extension at the end
of encrypted files, and the same URL structure for C&C servers. This confirms the theory
that the Necurs operators rushed to deploy Locky after Kaspersky published the Jaff
decrypter.

Locky's new tactics
But there are also new wrinkles in this new Locky spam wave as well. Vitaly Kremez,
Flashpoint Director of Research, discovered that Locky uses a new method of launching the
infected binary on targeted hosts.

In addition, the Locky spam emails use new texts for the email subjects and body content,
albeit they still pretend to be invoices, payment receipts, order confirmations, and so on.
These emails also packed file attachments differently, utilizing a double-nested ZIP
structure. The emails Bleeping Computer analyzed deliver a ZIP file with names in the
format of eight random digits (e.g.: 38017832.zip). This initial ZIP file contains another ZIP
file, which in turns contains an EXE file that runs Locky when executed.

Last but not least, this Locky version also added some anti-debugging protections that
prevent the ransomware from running in virtual machines and other debug environments,
which explains why researchers had a hard time analyzing it for the first few hours.
Overall, this particular Locky spam run seems to be a rushed effort, but we can expect the
ransomware's operators to correct their flaws and start delivering a fixed version in the
following days.
Below are other indicators of compromise for this latest Locky variant.

There is no stopping it. Feels really unsafe now. After recent attack of WannaCry
ransomware, Semantic team said there is 2nd wave is still to come and attacks has
increased drastically in past 2 years. From 2015 to 2016, the number of ransomware
attacks were total 2 million and rose 17.7 % from the previous year as per
gotowebsecurity - http://gotowebsecurity.com/ransomware-getting-worse/. It really
dangerous to see such attacks. Most of the offices still using older version and still
struggling to adopt new technology. Its really bad.
