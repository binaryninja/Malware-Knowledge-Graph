April 14, 2022

By: Max Malyutin – Orion Threat Research Team Leader
Orion, Cynet’s Threat Research and Intelligence team, spotted a new malware campaign in
the wild: BumbleBee.
Wondering what’s going on? Let us fill you in.
We noticed a new trend in Initial Access Brokers’ (IAB) tactics to gain access to their victims’
machines. Initial Access Brokers refers to a cybercrime group that specializes in gaining
initial access to organizations for the sole purpose of offering it to other threat actor groups.
The trend started earlier this year and our team recently spotted their new BumbleBee
campaign.
Usually, we observe malicious spam (MalSpam) campaigns that deliver malicious documents
(MalDoc) to lure the victims to interact with the MalDoc and execute the malicious macro
code by clicking “Enable Content.” That in turn downloads and executes the malicious
payload, for example, the notorious Emotet campaigns.
We expected these groups to change the initial access methods. We believe there is a direct
relation to the changes Microsoft applied recently to the default policy in their Office
products: “Macros from the internet will be blocked by default in Office” and “Excel 4.0 (XLM)
1/22

macros are disabled by default.” These changes impact IABs because they have been
abusing Office documents with malicious macros for years.
It appears that they’ve come up with a plan B.
In this post, we will cover what this campaign is, and how the IAB distributes the BumbleBee
malware and its TTPs. We will also explain each TTP according to the MITRE ATT&CK
model, and its purpose.

A new campaign in the wild: BumbleBee
From our initial analysis, BumbleBee is a custom new loader that is used by different IAB
groups. This malware was observed injecting Cobalt Strike shellcodes in memory and using
several tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in order to compromise the victim’s
environment.
As part of the campaign, the threat actors abuse spoofed companies’ identities (like fake
employee email addresses, fake websites, etc.) and use legitimate public storage services to
deliver the malicious ISO image file. The ISO image file is responsible for luring the victim to
execute the BumbleBee malware.
We’ve seen Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) execution with rundll32, which allows
threat actors to avoid defenses. BumbleBee also creates a scheduled task on the
compromised host for persistence and executes a Visual Basic script via the scheduled task.
The IAB relies on the user (victim) execution to execute the BumbleBee payload by luring the
victim to mount an ISO image file and click on a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.
The malware name, BumbleBee, was chosen because of its unique user agent,
“bumblebee,” that was used as part of the communication with the command and control
server (C2).
Threat Analysis Group (TAG) shared observations on the financially motivated threat actor,
EXOTIC LILY, that use the BumbleBee malware. In addition, TAG mentioned an interesting
point of collaboration between EXOTIC LILY and the WIZARD SPIDER threat group.

Orion’s observations
This type of attack is new, and the cybersecurity community is still gathering data to glean
more insights on the nature of this attack and its targets.
Orion found a high number of targeted companies based in the US with the following
distribution method that delivers the BumbleBee malware: Spear phishing email > URL Link
(TransferXL, TransferNow, WeTransfer) > Zipped ISO > ISO (contains the LNK file and the
BumbleBee payload).

You can see the execution flow in the image below.

The infection flow
We’ve handled several incident response (IR) cases where threat actors distributed
BumbleBee malware. After the initial infection, the threat actors inject Cobalt Strike shellcode
in memory and execute discovery commands to collect info about the victim’s network. We
believe that threat actors performed this data collection in order to execute the next stage of
the infection.
The next stage is probably related to ransomware operations. We’re still investigating IR
cases in order to find conclusive evidence that the next stage delivers ransomware.
On April 12, 2022, the BumbleBee IAB group was spotted using IMG file format in addition to
ISO file format.
You can see an example in the image below.

Orion’s technical analysis
Initial Access
The BumbleBee payload was delivered via a spear phishing email that was sent from a
spoofed email address. The email contains a URL link to the legitimate public storage
service, TransferXL.

Spear phishing email with a link to TransferXL
Below you’ll see the legitimate public storage site, which leads the victim to the link to the
malicious file.

TransferXL legitimate public storage services
Once they click download, the victim receives a ZIP folder that contains the malicious ISO
image files.

Spoofed company email address

Execution
Below is an example of what the ZIP file from the TransferXL link looks like.

ZIP file download from TransferXL
The ZIP file contains an ISO image file with the following name “documents-04-106.iso.”
Note that the following ISO image file name pattern was used for all the files that we have
analyzed:
documents-[0-9]{1,4}-[0-9]{1,4}\.iso

5/22

ISO image file
From this step, threat actors rely on the victim (user) interaction with the ISO image file. The
threat actors use a masquerading technique by setting the LNK file icon to be a folder icon in
order to lure the victim to click on the LNK file:

ISO image file contains LNK and DLL
In addition, the DLL payload attribute is set as “Hidden” in order to hide the DLL payload
from the user when interacting with the ISO image file:

6/22

Hidden attribute for the DLL
The masqueraded LNK file properties show that the execution target is as follows:
C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe settings.dll,IternalJob

7/22

LNK executes the DLL via rundll32 command
After the initial execution, the BumbleBee DLL is copied to the %programdata%/{RandomDir}
directory. In addition to the DLL, a VBS script is also dropped to the same directory:
[a-z]:\\programdata\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\[a-z0-9]{16}\.[vbs|dll]

TTPs indicators during the execution
We have other artifacts from different IR cases, where we have observed the following
activity. The screenshot below shows an event that detected a creation of a payload in the
%ProgramData%\{Random} directory the DLL payload is a copy of the initial BumbleBee

loader that executed by Rundll32 from the ISO image file:

Copy of the BumbleBee DLL to %Programdata% directory
In other IR cases, we observed an execution flow that’s bit different. For example, a LNK that
points to the following execution targets:
cmd.exe /c start rundll32 neqw.dll,IternalJob
rundll32.exe advpack.dll,RegisterOCX sysctl.exe

Persistence
We detected a scheduled task execution during the BumbleBee infection:
Grandparent process:
svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule
Parent process:
wscript.exe [a-z]:\\programdata\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\[a-z0-9]{16}\.vbs
Child process:
rundll32.exe [a-z]:\\programdata\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\[a-z0-9]{16}\.dll,{Export}

Strings from the BumbleBee loader show the VBS script and the execution method
We also observed WMI execution. The VBS file that was executed via a scheduled task, was
also executed through WMI:

9/22

Grandparent process:
svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch
Parent process:
wmiprvse.exe -Embedding
Child process:
wscript.exe [a-z]:\\programdata\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\[a-z0-9]{16}\.vbs

Strings from the Bumblebee loader show the WMI Win32_Process execution

Defense Evasion
In our labs, we observed that BumbleBee uses several anti-VM methods to avoid detection.
One of the anti-VM checks is related to the VirtualBox product:

Check for lpWindowName if matches VirtualBox
Other anti-VM artifacts were found after unpacking, as can be seen in the following strings:

List of strings that are related to VMware and VirtualBox
BumbleBee also detects if it is running within a VM by checking for known services that are
related to different VM products:

11/22

List of services that are related to VM products
BumbleBee checks whether certain user names reside in the victim’s machine by comparing
against a hardcoded list of user names. This allows BumbleBee to detect sandboxes and
labs that are used for malware analysis:

In addition, it uses WMI queries to collect system details and information:
SELECT * FROM Win32_BaseBoard
SELECT * FROM Win32_Bus
12/22

SELECT * FROM Win32_ComputerSystem
SELECT * FROM Win32_Fan
SELECT * FROM Win32_NTEventlogFile
SELECT * FROM Win32_OperatingSystem
SELECT * FROM Win32_PnPDevice
SELECT * FROM Win32_PnPEntity

Discovery
We found that the threat actors used the AdFind tool to enumerate and map the victim’s
network. The ADFind tool was found in the %ProgramData% directory.
In the instance we observed, the following commands were used:
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp
adfind.exe -f “(objectcategory=group)”
adfind.exe -f “(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)”
adfind.exe -f “objectcategory=computer”
adfind.exe -f “(objectcategory=person)”

Command and Control
After the initial execution, the BumbleBee process (Rundll32) communicated with the
Command-and-Control server (C2). We’ve seen several C2 servers from different IR cases:
IP: 23.82.19[.]208:443
IP: 192.236.198[.]63:433
IP: 45.147.229[.]177:433

Example of the unique User-Agent: BumbleBee in the payload’s memory

Additional reference to the BumbleBee malware name
All the collected system and network information is sent to the C2 server, which sends back
a response containing the next step/command to execute based on that info.

BumbleBee binary analysis
In this section, we will cover some interesting indicators and artifacts that highlighted the
BumbleBee actions and heuristics. These artifacts also help us to identify the BumbleBee
malware.
We analyzed several payloads and all of them had the same artifacts.
After unpacking the BumbleBee loader and by searching in the metadata of the unpacked
payload, we identified BumbleBee’s internal name, “LdrAddx64.dll,” and two export functions
– “IternalJob” and “SetPath.”

BumbleBee internal name, export functions, and TimeDateStamp
In the image below, we found the BumbleBee internal name and export function inside the
process Rundll32.exe that executed the BumbleBee DLL loader:

Bumblebee’s internal name and the export functions names in the memory
By inspecting the unpacked BumbleBee sections, we discovered that the .data section
contains two executables:

PEStudio shows the unpacked Bumblebee section and highlighted the .data section
We extracted the two hidden payloads from the .data section by using Hex-Editor tool:

Hex-Editor shows 3 MZ headers: the first one is the Bumblebee, and the other two are
additional payloads
The first payload from the .data section is a 32-bit DLL payload:

16/22

PEStudio showing the payload’s metadata
We found a few interesting functions in the payload strings indicating that this payload has
process injection capabilities. For example, “CreateProcess,” “NtWriteVirtualMemory,”
“CreateRemoteThread,”and “WinExec.”

The second payload that we extracted from the .data section is a 64-bit DLL payload:

18/22

PEStudio showing the payload’s metadata
We analyzed the payload binary and noticed that this payload is responsible for
communicating with BumbleBee’s C2 server:

In the strings we can see the C2 server’s IP address and port

19/22

Both DLL payloads have the same internal name “RapportGP.dll.” An interesting point
regarding the payloads internal name is that there is a legitimate DLL named “RapportGP.dll”
that is part of a “Trusteer Ltd” product from a computer security division of IBM.

Final notes
BumbleBee threat actors are not the first to change the initial access method from malicious
office documents to malicious ISO image files. The ISO image file abuse was also seen a
few years ago, but in recent months, we have observed an increase in “ISO campaigns.”
Different threat actors abuse ISO image files to deliver their payloads. For example,
BazarISO deploys Bazarloader, and IcedID started to use ISO image files instead of
MalDocs like in the two examples below.

Documents-17.iso (Bazarloader)

20/22

Invoice_pdf_1.iso (IcedID)
In most of the cases, we’ve seen that during different IR cases, the campaigns escalated to
full-blown ransomware attacks. We believe that IAB groups work and collaborate with
ransomware affiliates like CONTI, LockBit, AvosLocker, and more. For example, we
observed an IcedID infection that leads to CONTI ransomware attack (Shelob Moonlight)..
The Orion team is constantly monitoring BumbleBee and the IAB group’s activities closely
and analyzing them to better understand their motivation. As we learn more, we will publish
our findings and artifacts to share additional insights for BumbleBee infection to ransomware
post-attack chain.
We’re expecting to see more malware campaigns that will use the ISO delivery method in the
near future. So, stay vigilant.
As a final note, we’d like to share these indicators of compromise with you.
