Introduction
It isn’t often the whole world gets an inside look of the business operations of a top tier
cybercriminal group. Very early on in the Russian-Ukrainian Crisis the predominantly
Russian based ransomware group Conti made a public statement where they expressed
their loyalty to the Russian Administration.

BleepingComputer
As a reaction to this statement and the current conflict, a Ukrainian security researcher,
operating by the twitter handle @contileaks decided to publish years of Conti’s internal
Jabber conversations online. The chats that were dumped span across several years
consisted of thousands of messages making this the “Panama Papers of Ransomware”.
This wasn’t the first time the Conti gang got hit, last summer a disgruntled affiliate posted
their attack playbook online, which was full of very useful intelligence for our customers.
Since it was public, the whole security community jumped to review the chats and within
hours the first findings appeared on Twitter. Trellix was also quick to obtain the dataset and
realized that this might be one of the largest “crowd-sourced cyber investigations” ever seen.
What this means is that as a research team you must devise a flexible dissemination
strategy because findings by the crowd will appear online. So, it is constant balance between
verification of the published findings by others, investing in your own research goals and
adjusting some of these goals based on new information.
Even though it was very tempting to dive down the rabbit hole immediately we did make sure
we attacked the dataset with a certain plan.

Dissemination strategy; How to avoid the rabbit hole
Attack infrastructure
The first batch of leaked chats were only a couple of days old and ranging back quite some
time. From the start we realized that the criminals might have left valuable data on their
attack infrastructure in the chats. We wrote a quick extraction script and compared the
mentioned network artifacts to our current dataset and saw a lot of overlap. Not only did we
see overlap with infrastructure we attributed to TrickBot and Cobalt Strike in the past, but a
good portion of the systems we filtered out were still alive and kicking. To prevent any
retaliation by the Conti group directed at our customers, blocking this infrastructure was top
priority.
Some of these live systems were actually located in the countries where we have a good
relationship with Law Enforcement, so naturally we reached out and made sure they got a
heads-up to take appropriate measures quickly.

The intelligence gathered from this was very actionable, but with a short shelf life, the next
stop for us was tradecraft.
TTPs and tradecraft
Due to the severity of the leaks, there was a good chance that the Conti gang would rebrand
or disperse it members across other ransomware families. In the prior leak where Conti’s
playbook got dumped online there were excellent descriptions of the different tools and
scripts they would use to attack their victims. So, looking at around 200 thousand leaked
messages (Conti & TrickBot leaks combined) span over the period 2020-2022, it was likely
members would share custom TTP’s or tradecraft amongst each other.
By filtering tool names and command line structures we found several examples where
members discussed tool usage. Given the crowd sourced nature of this dump we would also
like to thank The DFIR Report for their excellent findings which they published via their
Twitter account.
Affiliates might leave Conti and their network, but wherever they go they will take along their
tradecraft. Without an external intervention, like an arrest, we should anticipate that
cybercriminals won’t stop their line of business, and thus we can expect to see their TTPs
pop up in the future. However, through proper dissemination of the data we were able to
empower many of our XDR product teams to improve the product efficacy against this
tradecraft and incorporate our findings in MVISION Insights for customer visibility.
Did we ignore the juicy conversations completely? Not at all, fortunately we have a native
Russian speaking research capability that made a huge difference while going down the
rabbit hole. In the following section we will highlight some of the findings we found interesting
to share.

Interesting chats
For transparency purposes we have included both the original Cyrillic and our human
translated text to allow readers to delve into the intricacies of some of the Conti’s
discussions. For readability purposes we have put the original leaked messages into 1-2-1
conversations to make it easier to understand/follow the context.
Conti as an enterprise
It is fascinating how much Conti resembles an ordinary firm with an office building, HR and
other departments (testers, reversers, OSINT, coders, training team, etc.) with their regular
salaries on the 15th and 30th of each month. Working hours are 10.00-18.00 Moscow time,
five days a week. Stern is the boss who oversees everything and has 100 people on the
payroll. “The weekend are the weekends. And nobody cancelled the vacations and sick
days. All the other holidays - with the management's agreement” says Salmon (recruiter) to
new hire-coder Core. According to Bentley (manager), he worked there for a year, but the
3/19

company has existed for more than 10 years. Below are excerpts from various chats which
provide a good glimpse into Conti’s organization and the presence of a physical office(s) in
Russia:

Figure 2. Target's messages to Stern about office expenses

Figure 3. Mango to Stern about teams’ monthly salary

Figure 4. Mango to Qwerty about team composition
It is particularly interesting that in the Conti-TrickBot enterprise they are very careful about
malware code overlapping. They have external experts who scrutinize developed illegal
software code and ensure the code fingerprints are unique to each team of coders. Avoiding
overlap seems to be important to segregate activities of different sub-teams and make it
difficult for security researchers to piece various Russian speaking threat actors’ campaigns
together.

Figure 5. Salmon to Core about company’s policy on intellectual property
Possible government connections
According to Angelo (tester/coder), Stern is closely affiliated with FSB or other structures
and works for ‘Pu’. If Stern was not as almighty as God, they all would have ended up as
REvil:

Figure 6. Angelo saying to Hammer that Stern is close to FSB

Figure 7. Elroy and Angelo discussing how almighty their boss Stern is
The Conti leadership was concerned over the situation surrounding the REvil ransomware
group. However, Conti believed Russian authorities arrested only the lowest ranked
members of REvil who were involved in the cash out.
It is worth mentioning that Basil (tester/coder) was asked if he is from FSB, he subsequently
replied he had serious intelligence related to Ukrainian border activity. This statement was
made seven days prior to Russia’s incursion into Ukraine:

Figure 8. Basil and Elroy on REvil arrest
In another conversation involving Target (manager) he stated if they indeed encrypted Credit
One Bank Troy (tester/crypter) would get a reward in the Kremlin:

Figure 9. Target to Troy saying he gets a reward in the Kremlin
Occasionally Conti seems to be asked to do so-called ‘pioneering’ (volunteering) work on a
special request from one of two ‘offices’. As Soviet Pioneers (aka scouts) they do their fair
share of work similarly to what Cozy Bear does:

6/19

Figure 10. Stern and Professor discussing what they need from Academi hack
It is probable that one of the two offices is a so-called ‘Bolshoy Dom’ (Big House), an office
building located at 4 Liteyny Avenue which serves as the headquarters of Saint Peterburg’s
local branch of FSB:

Figure 11. Target to Professor mentioning FSB’s HQ address
In line with geo-political interests of Russia, Conti seems to have a ‘stop’ on China and get
terrified every time they see a Russian company or ‘OOO’ abbreviation (equivalent of ‘LLC’
in CIS countries) in the list of their victims:

8/19

Figure 12. Target and Troy discovered a RU entity in their list of potential victims

Figure 13. Troy confirms to Target they have a stop on China
All these messages corraborate the fact that Conti-TrickBot enterprise has a close
relationship with Russian government and/or act in its interests.
Collaboration with other Malware families
Conti-Ryuk
Collaboration with Ryuk seemed to have started around August 2020 when Stern said,
“Ryuk is going start as of Monday.” Target seemed to responsible for updating Stern on how
the Conti-Ryuk collaboration was going and if Ryuk team is able to work together and
smoothly with his team:

9/19

Figure 14. Conti-Ryuk initial plans on collaboration
As per the chat between Stern, Target and Troy, it is evident that from September 2020 to
October 2020 Conti-Ryuk successfully executed attacks on Sopra Steria, Steelcase, Merieux
NutriSciences and Northern Trust and received 1.5 million (currency is unknown) in ransom
payments:

Figure 15. Potential victims of Conti-Ryuk collaboration
Conti-Maze
The first mention of Conti-Maze potential connection dates back July 2020, when Kevin
(coder/crypter) says to Stern “Prof took a different locker as far as I understood. Appears to
be Maze. Said he has rolled it at night”. Then Kevin suggests to Prof (team lead/manager)
that Conti-Maze negotiation should be handled by Stern himself as he is more experienced.
He then says Maze will take 25-30%. It seems that Prof contacted developers of Maze and
managed to get the ransomware build which was later given to Conti reversers to figure out
how it works and build a locker “not worse than Maze, and even better”:

10/19

Figure 16. Reshaev to Stern advising a new Maze-based locker will be better than
Maze
When it comes to Conti-Maze victims, it seems that both were involved in hacking Academi
(former Blackwater), a U.S. private military company who provides services to CIA. “We
[expletive] Academi for almost a year” says Target to Dandis (tester). Academi and the
affiliated Triple Canopy, Olive Group Capital Ltd, Strategic Social LLC and Constellis Group
were all infected/hacked around mid-July 2020 and Maze had negotiations in one of the
victim’s networks. Stern informed his subordinates that they are primarily looking for chats,
contracts, PII, emails and accounting and that the request seems to be originating from one
of the two ‘offices’ (see above, the chat where they mentioned Cozy Bear). Target reports to
Stern they infected 30+ military companies along with some agencies, one of which is The
US Environmental Protection Agency:

Figure 18. Target to Stern about 30+ military companies they infected
Conti-Netwalker
Mid-April 2021 Stern asked Bentley and Professor to add Netwalker’s jabber account to
their contact list. In mid-2020, Trellix wrote an in-depth blog on Netwalker explaining not only
their malware but how we uncovered a large portion of their funds. In January 2021, Law
Enforcement managed to takedown the Netwalker’s dark web site and arrested an affiliate
based in Canada. After these interventions, it got really quiet arround Netwalker. Given the
appearance date of the Netwalker moniker within the Conti jabber server, it is possible that
Netwalker affiliates found a new home within the Conti group.
According to Stern, Netwalker will use the TrickBot botnet to distribute their malware.
Bentley was in charge of onboarding Netwalker to their admin panel, VNC, etc. and
providing them with tested LNK/XLS files with payload to use in their campaigns. It looks like
there was friction in the beginning of the collaboration and Netwalker did not get the
promised bonus from Stern, and Stern did not like that Netwalker was passing the Citrix’es
given to him to other parties:

12/19

Figure 19. Initial friction between Netwalker and Stern
Later in May 2021 Netwalker provided Stern the details of their two potential victims,
Blackbaud, Inc. and Ellsworth Adhesives, and asked him to pay to his team as they worked
hard:

Figure 20. Potential Conti-Netwalker victims
Blackbaud, Inc. disclosed that they indeed paid ransom to the perpetrators but never
mentioned who they actually were nor the amount of ransom they paid.
Conti-Lockbit
There is a hint of Conti-TrickBot potentially collaborating with LockBit group. At the beginning
of November 2021, Defender (manager) said to Stern that the account Brom was
(re)created in Group 6 for LockbitSupp (an alias strongly associated with LockBit
ransomware group):

13/19

Figure 21. Defender advising to Stern he added LockBitSupp to their Jabber
Two weeks after, Mango (team lead/manager) told Stern that there was misunderstanding
with LockBit and asked him about the percentage of networks and revenue they will take
from LockBit in case of successful collaboration:

Figure 22. Stern to Mango on percentage of revenue they take from Conti-LockBit
collaboration
TrickBot, Buer, Amadey and IcedID
On June 26, 2020, Taker (tester) who just began the conversation with Stern asked
questions around what TrickBot was and how it got started. “It started as a banking bot,
gathering logs, logins, and passwords. It was a financial matter” replied Stern. Later in
October 2020, Target said to Troy, “They managed to connect Cobalt, Bazar and TrickBot
together. They figured that TrickBot is us.” On the August 19, 2021, Professor got furious
when somebody mistakenly included the TrickBot module designed to not infect CIS
countries into Diavol ransomware (aka Conti) build, which allowed security researchers to
attribute TrickBot and Conti teams to the same threat actor:

Figure 23. Professor advising Stern TrickBot module was added into Conti
ransomware build
Amadey and Buer were also mentioned multiple time in Conti chats as alternative loaders. In
June 2020, Price (coder) said to Target, “Hof referred me to a hacker forum, I got access to
it (for money) and copied Buer’s entire ins and outs from there.” As for Amadey loader, it

14/19

looks that Conti team bought it and every time Amadey required a ‘re-crypt’ they would pay
for that.
Furthermore, Leo (coder) from Conti gang appears to be the creator of IcedID loader which
in May 2021 was ‘on the first place among infections’:

Figure 24. Leo is the creator of IcedID malware
Conti’s victims: NGO, Medical institutions among others
We went through the Conti leaked messages and compiled a list of their potential victims
which mainly includes EU and U.S. entities across various sectors. Most of the 103 potential
victims we have identified were located via a Zoominfo URL Conti used to check a
company’s size and revenue to determine a ransom amount to ask. “Found a way of buying
a Zoominfo account, 2 managers for Buza, for his pricing research, the price is 2k” advised
Mango to Stern. Later Stern said to Mavelek (coder/tester), “@ali has a script to check
domains on Zoominfo to get data on number of employees and the revenue of the company.”
Between 2020-2022 Conti and its affiliates targeted and potentially attacked twelve
healthcare organizations (clinics, hospitals, care houses including UHS, Prodemica, Geo
Group), five educational institutions (schools, colleges, universities, etc.), a charitable
organization, a governmental agency, and numerous companies in financial, retail, business
services, manufacturing, and other industries:

Figure 25. The chart gives an overview of the Conti’s potential victims by sector
Call center services
Among other departments, Conti has a team of callers. A caller is required to have a good
knowledge of spoken English (level B2-C1) and between age 18 and 25. They are recruited
by Conti’s HR team to work remotely for ‘an online store’ abroad. The callers earn $450-500
a month (salary increases by $100 - $200 - $300, depending on the success of the callcentre), working hours are 18:00-2:00 Moscow time (correspond to usual working hours in
Western hemisphere), and they receive paid holidays but get no official contract as per the
Labour Code.
Below are Mango’s messages to Stern where he suggests some improvements around
blackmailing/call-center and explains a concept which is ‘more or less’ working for them:

Cybercriminal entrepreneurship (crypto and Forum)
By end of May 2021 Stern instructed Mango to get in touch with the administrators of exploit
forums to see if they were willing to sell to Conti. “Also get a list of forums which can be
considered for sale. XSS - find out a list of active users, per day, week, month. The same for
Antichat and WWH,” continued Stern. Later Mango replied that WWH had laughed out loud
at their offer and that hxxp://korovka32xc3t5cg[.]onion and hxxp://crdclub4wraumez4[.]onion
were available for sale. However, he advised those forums are rubbish, a hotbed of grifters,
and instead of trying to buy a forum they should create one on their own. The following is
Mango’s suggestion to which he got a ‘go-ahead’ from Stern:

Figure 27. Mango to Stern on their new hacker forum and it’s functionalities
In July 2021, Mango sent two design suggestions for the social network (aka forum) to Stern
– one in dark-green and another in dark-blue color schemes. Stern approved the dark-green
variant for the forum and suggested it was ready to make it available with a minimum
functionality:

Figure 28. Two design suggestions for the hacker forum
Below are the conversation extracts between Stern and Mango, full of entrepreneurial spirit,
where they brainstorm what functionalities the forum should have and what might potentially
work for it and what might not:

17/19

Figure 29. Mango and Stern discussing their new hacker forum
Later Mango suggested a potential domain for the forum and a logo for it:
“matryoshka[.]space (already with the domain:)) and as a logo matryoshka but angry, in our
color scheme, dark-green, and may be draw a laptop next to it. In principle matches the
theme. We are one big system amongst the multiple other sub-systems in one place. And it
is clear that it is a Russian theme. It is going to be cool, and easy to remember, I think it will
resonate with everyone”.
Purchase of Carbon Black and SonicWall
In March 2021 Stern said to Defender that he needs Carbon Black AV. In April 2021 Mango
asked Professor if 60k (currency is unknown) is a lot for Carbon, 30k for the firm who buys
and 30k for the Carbon itself for 250 PCs. A week later it seems that Mango managed to
purchase Carbon Black via a firm in France for 14.8k euros (plus 20% for BTC conversion
and 30k for the firm as promised). However, Stern did not take Carbon Black AV and in July
2021 Mango asked him why they aren’t doing anything with Carbon Black to which Stern
replied that originally Ryuk needed it and now for some reason they no longer do:

Figure 30. Stern advising to Mango Carbon Black AV was bought for Ryuk team

18/19

In February 2021 Stern said to Swift (tester/coder) that he also needs SonicWall solution.
He broadcast to all the contacts in Jabber “Who can figure out the vulnerability in SonicWall
and make a working scanner for it?” to which Ghost (tester/coder) replied “This one, CVE2020-5135: Critical SonicWall VPN Portal Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability, right?”.
The CVE-2020-5135 is a CVSSv3 9.4/10 critical vulnerability which was fixed around
November 2020 and according to SonicWall PSIRT there was no exploitation observed in the
wild. Mid-April 2021 Mango advised Stern there are several ways to buy SonicWall (even a
new model SMA 410) and later that they manage to buy new as well as refurbished ones:

Figure 31. Mango to Stern on the purchase of SonicWall
There is not much further information regarding SonicWall, except that in June 2021
Subzero (tester/coder) advised to Stern that he “figured out the SonicWall”.

Conclusion
Financially motivated cyber criminals have a history of collaboration across borders and
often stay away from politics. However, the current Russia-Ukraine conflict isn’t one to
ignore, not even for cybercriminals, as they are forced to choose sides.
The ContiLeaks and TrickBotLeaks were a direct result of this conflict. The leaks are of an
unprecedented level and show the world how a government backed, multimillion-dollar
ransomware gang operates. In some fashion it was almost like a normal business; wages
needed to be paid, software licenses obtained, customer service initiated, and strategic
alliances had to be formed. However, make no mistake, this business is dealing in top level
cybercrime, with a strategic alliance to an intelligence apparatus responsible for several
nation-state attacks.
In our line of work, we are often aware of technical innerworkings, partnerships between
malware families and suspected nation state relationships but reading the internal
conversations and having our suspicions confirmed was very insightful.
