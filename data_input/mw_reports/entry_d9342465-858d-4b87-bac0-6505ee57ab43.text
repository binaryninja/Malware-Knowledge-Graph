After installing the service, "DorusioUpgrade.exe" has similar behavior to the upgrade components of Kupay Wallet (AppleJeus variant 4) and Coi
variant 5). On startup, "DorusioUpgrade.exe" allocates memory in order to later write a file. After allocating the memory and storing the hardcoded
variable, the program attempts to open a network connection. The connection is named “Dorusio Wallet 2.1.0 (Check Update Windows)”, likely to
user.

6/10

Similar to previous AppleJeus variants, "DorusioUpgrade.exe" collects some basic information from the system as well as a timestamp and places
format strings. Specifically, the timestamp is placed into a format string “ver=%d&timestamp=%lu” where ver is set as the 201000, possibly referrin
version previously mentioned (Figure 5).
This basic information and hard-coded strings are sent via a POST to the command and control (C2) "dorusio.com/dorusio_update.php." If the PO
returns an HTTP response status code of 200) but fails any of multiple different checks, "DorusioUpgrade.exe" will sleep for two minutes and then
timestamp and contact the C2 again.
After receiving the payload from the C2, the program writes the payload to memory and executes the payload.
The payload could not be downloaded as the C2 server dorusio.com/dorusio_update.php is no longer accessible. In addition, the sample was not
reporting for this sample.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.

9/10

Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
