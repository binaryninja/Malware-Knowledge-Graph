The Avaddon ransomware family was first sighted in the wild in February 2020, but fully
emerged as a robust Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model in June of that year. Over the
last 9 months or so, the operator behind Avaddon has been successful in building a strong
and reliable brand, moving quickly to support affiliates with an update after security
researchers released a public decryptor in February 2021. Since then, we have observed a
spike in Avaddon activity and note that the actor is actively engaged in developing “Version
2” of this aggressive RaaS offering.
In this post, we detail the rapid development of Avaddon, highlighting the malware author’s
ability to adapt to circumstances and maximize payouts for Avaddon affiliates.

Avaddon RaaS Overview
After initial sightings in attacks from February 2020 onwards, Avaddon fully emerged as a
RaaS in June of 2020. It was heavily promoted in underground markets as a fast, bespoke,
highly-configurable, and well-supported ransomware service.
The Avaddon operator offered partners fairly standard terms with the RaaS taking an initial
25% cut but willing to drop that percentage for higher volume affiliates. Over the following
months, Avaddon became one of the more aggressive ransomware groups targeting both
individuals and businesses. Following the model of other RaaS families that came before it,
Avaddon soon put up a blog site dedicated to leaking victim data should victims fail to pay
the ransom demand.

Since its inception, Avaddon refused to accept affiliates targeting CIS (Commonwealth of
Independant States) countries. This is in addition to being critical of any dealings with nonRussian-native speaking individuals.
Right out of the gate, Avaddon touted their speed, configurability, and robust feature set. The
first version of Avaddon was advertised with the following features:
Unique payloads written in C++
File encryption via AES256 + RSA2048, supporting full-file encryption & custom
parameters
Full offline support, initial contact to C2 not required
“Impossible” 3rd party decryption
Support for Windows 7 and higher
Multi-threaded file encryption for max performance
Encryption of all local and remote (and accessible) drives
IOCP Support for parallel file encryption
Persistently encrypts newly written files and newly connected media
Ability to spread across network shares (SMB, DFS)
Multiple delivery options (script, PowerShell, .EXE payload, .DLL)
Payload executes as administrator
Encrypts hidden files and volumes
Removes trash, Volume Shadow Copies (VSS), and other restore points
Termination of processes which inhibit encryption of files
Configurable ransom note behavior
Initially, affiliates were able to build and manage their payload via an elegant administration
panel hosted via TOR (.onion). The panel allowed for management of specific campaigns,
payment types and behaviors, victim tracking and management. It also served as the portal
to Avaddon’s technical support resources.
Over the following weeks, Avaddon picked up a great amount of momentum, continued to
advertise for recruitments and boasted about their coverage in the press.

In the second half of 2020, Avaddon continued to build its infected base, while also
continuing to upgrade the service and payloads.
As AV engines began adding detection rules for Avaddon, the operator responded with
frequent updates to ensure the desired level of stealth. In late June 2020, the malware added
the option to launch payloads via PowerShell.
In August 2020, some more significant upgrades to the service came in the form of 24/7
support. The actors indicated at the time that 24×7 support for affiliates was now available
via chat and ticketing systems.

In addition, Avaddon was one of the early adopters of additional extortion methods to taunt
and advertise the breach of non-compliant victims, including the use of targeted
advertisements. The authors continued to improve the payloads themselves with better

4/14

Distributed File System (DFS) support, different encryption mechanisms, and DLL payload
support.
New Year 2021 brought further changes to the Avaddon platform. In January, the actor
added support for Windows XP and 2003 in the payloads, as well as tweaks to the
encryption feature set. Notably, Avaddon was one of the first to add DDoS attacks as yet
another intimidation mechanism to their arsenal: If clients failed to comply with the ransom
demands, they stood to experience a damaging DDoS attack in addition to their data being
leaked to the public, and any tarnishing of their reputation as a result of the breach.
Everything seemed to be going well for the Avaddon RaaS, but then they hit a hurdle.

Avaddon Public Decrypter
In early 2021, a decryption tool for Avaddon was released by Bitdefender. Additionally, an
open-source decryptor was also released by researcher Javier Yuste based on his extensive
paper detailing the internals of Avaddon.
Under the hood, Avaddon payloads were storing the ‘secret’ session keys for encryption in
memory. This allowed analysts and researchers to locate the data and extract the key for
analysis and eventual development of the decryption tool. The tool was widely released, and
posted to NoMoreRansom.org.
During this period, we even observed actors behind Babuk ransomware offering technical
assistance to the Avaddon actors.

Those behind Avaddon were quick to pivot and move to a different model altogether,
nullifying the effect of the decryptor. They also offered affiliates an 80% cut for a full month as
compensation.

5/14

Following the requisite upgrades to address the encryption issues, Avaddon continued to
update their services and toolset, in addition to becoming more aggressive with recruitment.
February 2021 also saw the addition of Monero support.
Subsequently, we have observed a spike in Avaddon activity, including new victim entries on
their blog. The actor’s most recent public statements indicate that the development of
Avaddon V2 is well underway.

Avaddon RaaS Technical Breakdown
In the majority of cases, the initial delivery vector for Avaddon is via phishing email. However,
affiliates have been known to use RDP along with exploitation of network-centric
vulnerabilities. We have observed malicious emails with attached .js payloads, which in turn
retrieve the Avaddon payloads from a remote location. In some cases, threat actors have
simply attached the ransomware directly to the email messages.
Avaddon payloads perform checks to insure they are not executing on a victim device
located in certain regions of CIS.

The GetUserDefaultLCID() function (and/or GetKeyboardLayout() ) is used to
determine the users’ default locale. The following countries are most frequently excluded
from execution:
Russia
Cherokee Nation
Ukraine
Tatar
Yakut
Sakha
A commonly used UAC bypass technique is utilized to ensure that the threat is running with
the required privileges. Specifically, this is a UAC bypass via CMSTPLUA COM interface.
Existing Windows tools and utilities are used to manipulate and disable system recovery
options, backups, and Volume Shadow Copies. Some syntax can vary across
variants. WMIC.EXE is typically used to remove VSS via SHADOWCOPY DELETE
/nointeractive.
We have also observed the following commands issued by Avaddon payloads:
bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled No
bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures
vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet
wbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP -deleteOldest

7/14

While there have been changes to Avaddon’s encryption routine to combat 3rd party
decryption, the historic flow, simplified, would be:

1. Generation of session Key (AES 256)
2. Update master key (AES 256)
3. Master key encrypts relevant user and environment data, along with the ransom note
(typically Base64)
4. Files are encrypted via the session key
5. Append encrypted session key (RSA 2048) to the end of each encrypted file

Avaddon Evasion Techniques
Avaddon can be configured to terminate specific processes. This is frequently done to target
security products or processes which might interfere with the encryption process. An
example process list would be:
DefWatch
ccEvtMgr
ccSetMgr
SavRoam
dbsrv12
sqlservr
sqlagent
Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS
dbeng8
sqladhlp
QBIDPService
Culserver
RTVscan
vmware-usbarbitator64
vmware-converter
VMAuthdService
VMnetDHCP
VMUSBArbService
VMwareHostd
sqlbrowser
SQLADHLP
sqlwriter
msmdsrv
tomcat6
QBCFMonitorService

9/14

Avaddon has also been known to prioritize the encryption of Microsoft Exchange-related
directories.
Most Avaddon payloads will exclude the following critical OS locations from encryption:
C:PERFLOGS
C:PROGRAM FILES (X86)
C:PROGRAMDATA
C:USERS<USER>APPDATA
C:USERS<USER>APPDATALOCALTEMP
C:USERSPUBLIC
C:WINDOWS

Persistence mechanisms can also vary, and we have observed variations of Avaddon that
utilize the creation of a new Windows service, as well as the use of scheduled tasks for
persistence.

Avaddon Post-Infection Behavior
Infected files are renamed with an extension consisting of randomly generated letters. These
extensions are unique for each victim.

Earlier versions of Avaddon would also replace the infected hosts’ wallpaper image. The
current version presents victims with a ransom note as shown below. Victims are warned that
aside from their data being encrypted, the actors “have also downloaded a lot of private data
from your network”.

10/14

Victims are instructed to visit the Avaddon payment portal via the TOR browser, where they
must enter their unique ID (found in the ransom note) to proceed.
The actors behind Avaddon do not wait for victims to become non-compliant before they are
named and shamed on the blog. Company names appear with a timer, counting down to the
posting time for any data stolen from the targeted environment.

11/14

It is important to note that victims appear on the leak site at the point when they are
breached, and not just when the actor decides to release their data. This means that a
company breach could easily become public knowledge regardless of any action taken by
the victim, and potentially at a time where the target company would rather ‘control the
release’ of that type of information.
At the time of writing, there are just over sixty companies listed, 19 of which include fully
released dumps of sensitive information.
Avaddon does not appear to have any particular preference or scruples when it comes to
targets. Whereas some ransomware groups have backed off certain types of targets during
the ongoing pandemic, Avaddon victims to date include healthcare-related entities. That
said, the most represented industries in their victimology are Information Technology &
Services, Food Production, Legal Services, and Manufacturing.

Conclusion
Avaddon is another successful example of the current RaaS model. lt has appeared on the
scene and made an impact very quickly. The actors are disciplined with regard to whom they
will accept as an affiliate, which ensures some degree of longevity and exclusivity. In
addition, they very quickly adopted the more aggressive extortion techniques tied to modern
ransomware families. This not only includes the public leaking of data but also the threat of
DDoS attacks, personal threats, and advertisement-based taunting.
All of these, along with tight payment requirements for the victims, have put Avaddon in a
potentially powerful position. They have yet to garner quite the same amount of media
attention as predecessors such as Maze and Egregor, but there is no reason to believe that
Avaddon is any less dangerous. At this time, those behind Avaddon are highly-engaged with

12/14

their community and actively developing and iterating in response to security research and
detection. With Avaddon version 2 on the horizon, we only expect to see increased activity
from this actor as we move further into 2021.
