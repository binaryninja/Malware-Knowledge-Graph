Microsoft Internal Solorigate Investigation – Final Update
msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/02/18/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-final-update/

We believe the Solorigate incident is an opportunity to work with the community, to share
information, strengthen defenses and respond to attacks. We have now completed our
internal investigation into the activity of the actor and want to share our findings, which
confirm that we found no evidence of access to production services or customer data. The
investigation also found no indications that our systems at Microsoft were used to attack
others. Because of our defense-in-depth protections, the actor was also not able to gain
access to privileged credentials or leverage the SAML techniques against our corporate
domains.

Additional Details
As we previously reported, we detected unusual activity in December and took action to
secure our systems. Our analysis shows the first viewing of a file in a source repository was
in late November and ended when we secured the affected accounts. We continued to see
unsuccessful attempts at access by the actor into early January 2021, when the attempts
stopped.
There was no case where all repositories related to any single product or service was
accessed. There was no access to the vast majority of source code. For nearly all of code
repositories accessed, only a few individual files were viewed as a result of a repository
search.
For a small number of repositories, there was additional access, including in some cases,
downloading component source code. These repositories contained code for:
a small subset of Azure components (subsets of service, security, identity)
a small subset of Intune components
a small subset of Exchange components
The search terms used by the actor indicate the expected focus on attempting to find
secrets. Our development policy prohibits secrets in code and we run automated tools to
verify compliance. Because of the detected activity, we immediately initiated a verification
process for current and historical branches of the repositories. We have confirmed that the
repositories complied and did not contain any live, production credentials.

Lessons Learned

1/2

The cybersecurity industry has long been aware that sophisticated and well-funded actors
were theoretically capable of advanced techniques, patience, and operating below the radar,
but this incident has proven that it isn’t just theoretical. For us, the attacks have reinforced
two key learnings that we want to emphasize —embracing a Zero Trust mindset and
protecting privileged credentials.
A Zero Trust, “assume breach” philosophy is a critical part of defense. Zero Trust is a
transition from implicit trust—assuming that everything inside a corporate network is safe—to
the model that assumes breach and explicitly verifies the security status of identity, endpoint,
network, and other resources based on all available signals and data. We’ve recently shared
guidance for using Zero Trust principles to protect against sophisticated attacks like
Solorigate.
Protecting credentials is essential. In deployments that connect on-premises infrastructure to
the cloud, organizations can delegate trust to on-premises components. This creates an
additional seam that organizations need to secure. A consequence of this decision is that if
the on-premises environment is compromised, this creates opportunities for attackers to
target cloud services. We strongly recommend mastering identity in the Cloud, as described
in protecting your M365 cloud services from on-premise attacks.
We have also shared additional insights on these best practices in Turning the page on
Solorigate and opening the next chapter for the security community. Though our internal
investigation is closing, it does not mean we are done. It means we are maintaining our
normal Zero Trust security posture, where our security teams work continually to protect
users, devices and data from ongoing threats to our environment. Our collaborative work
with the cybersecurity community to protect from ongoing threats continues and, as we learn
more, we will share learnings and guidance as appropriate.
