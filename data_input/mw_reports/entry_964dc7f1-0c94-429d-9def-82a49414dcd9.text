LUCKY ELEPHANT Campaign Masquerading

Executive Summary
In early March 2019, ASERT Researchers uncovered a credential harvesting campaign
targeting mostly South Asian governments. The actors behind this campaign we call
LUCKY ELEPHANT use doppelganger webpages to mimic legitimate entities such as
foreign governments, telecommunications, and military. Interestingly, at least one IP
address used in the campaign was previously associated with a suspected Indian APT
group, and one domain was previously attributed to Chinese APT activity. It is unclear the
purpose of the overlap in the infrastructure, but it’s possible the actors used it as a
diversionary tactic.

Key Findings
ASERT uncovered a credential theft campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT where
attackers masquerade as legitimate entities such as foreign government,
telecommunications, and military.
The doppelganger webpages primary purpose is to gather login credentials; we
have not observed malware payloads associated with the campaign.
One IP address used in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign was previously used by
the suspected Indian APT DoNot Team; and at least one of the domains used for
credential harvesting was previously attributed to a Chinese APT group.

Capabilities
From at least February 2019 to present, the actors in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign
copied webpages to mimic South Asian government websites as well as Microsoft Outlook
365 login pages and hosted them on their own doppelganger domains, presumably to trick
victims into providing login credentials. They registered their doppelgangers with various
top-level domains (TLD), speciﬁcally those that afford the actors registrant anonymity.
ASERT suspects that the Actors use phishing emails to lure victims to the doppelganger
websites and entice users to enter their credentials. We have yet to uncover any malware
associated with this campaign.
The Actors download legitimate websites and webmail portals, which copies the entirety of
its contents and web components. This method saves time and prevents the introduction
of errors that could arouse suspicion. Figure 1 & Figure 2 show two of the doppelganger
webpages, clearly intending to pass as a legitimate place to input credentials.

Victims
Many of the targeted entities are easily identiﬁed based on the copied webpages or the
doppelganger names of the fake domains. To date, ASERT has no knowledge of
successful compromise. The following is a list of the organizations mimicked:
Pakistan:
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission
Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Pakistan National Telecom Corporation
Pakistani Air Force
Pakistan Ministry of Law & Justice
Pakistan Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce
Frontier Works Organization
Pakistan Ordnance Factories
Pakistani Nuclear Regulatory Authority
Bangladesh:
Bangladesh Air Force
Bangladesh Navy
Bangladesh Armed Services

Nepal:

Shanghai Cooperation Organization (a Eurasian political, economic, and security
alliance)

Infrastructure
We discovered two active IP addresses: 128.127.105[.]13 and 179.43.169[.]20. Through
the course of monitoring these IP addresses, we uncovered new doppelganger domains
set up to facilitate the credential harvesting campaign. This activity started in February
2019 and appears to be ongoing. Though we don't have WHOIS data for the domains, we
were able to track registration due to the small number of IP address utilized.
It is important to note that one domain, yahoomail[.]cf is only associated with this
group/campaign from February 2019 onward. In late 2018, the domain was associated
with a different APT group/campaign of Chinese origin. The subdomains
security[.]yahoomail[.]cf and cc[.]yahoomail[.]cf are related to the ExileRAT campaign
Cisco Talos reported (link). It is unclear if the domain ownership change was coincidental
or intended to confuse researchers.

Adversary
Based on our analysis into the activity, ASERT deems with moderate conﬁdence that an
Indian APT group is behind the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign. The targets are typical of
known Indian APT activity and the infrastructure was previously used by an Indian APT
group. Phishing and credential theft are commonly observed with Indian targeting inregion.
One of the IP addresses, 128.127.105[.]13, was previously used by the DoNot Team (aka
APT-C-35), a suspected Indian APT group. DoNot Team has a history of heavily targeting
Pakistan, in addition to other neighboring countries. The 360 Intelligence Center observed
four distinct campaigns against Pakistan since 2017 (link), recently targeting Pakistani
businessmen working in China. They also note that DoNot has targeted other South
Asian countries for cyber espionage purposes. DoNot Team’s conﬁrmed use of this IP
dates back to September 2018, with a six-month gap until it was used to host
doppelganger domains for the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign in early February.
The targeting of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization are all historical espionage targets by India. The
Indian government is particularly concerned with its neighboring countries, speciﬁcally
regarding contested land; the targeting aligns with these concerns. The heavier targeting
in Pakistan adheres to historical targeting and the ongoing tension between the two
countries, which has escalated since a terrorist attack in Kashmir on 14 February 2019.

Conclusion
Social engineering continues to be a key tool for adversaries to trick users into yielding
valuable information. The actors behind LUCKY ELEPHANT recognize the effectiveness
and use doppelganger webpages nearly identical to legitimate sites, enticing users to input
their credentials. It is unclear exactly how effective and widespread this campaign is at
gathering credentials, as well as how any compromised credentials are being used.
However, it is clear is that the actors are actively establishing infrastructure and are
targeting governments in South Asia.
ASERT Researchers are interested in collaborating with others to further the collective
knowledge of this campaign and we will tweet any additional IOCs under the Twitter
handle @ASERTResearch.

Recommendations
Organizations with a presence in South Asia should be on the lookout for these
IOCs and examine any “password” or “account”-themed emails

Users should always be wary when an email directs them to enter credentials of any
kind
Users should be cognizant of websites with TLDs such as .tk, .ml, .ga, .gq, and .cf,
as they are highly unlikely to be a legitimate government or corporate domain
Multi-factor authentication would likely prevent access from the compromised
credentials
If compromise of credentials is suspected, administrators should:
Perform an immediate password reset
Look for abnormal login activity that is outside the typical pattern of life for the
legitimate user
Host infosec training for users and remind them they are a target--at work and
home
