ATTACK
LANDSCAPE
H1 2019

INTRODUCTION
From millions to billions. In the first half of 2019, our global network of honeypots measured more
than triple the attack traffic of the previous period, to a total of over 2.9 billion events. It’s the first
time since we’ve begun publishing data from our honeypot network that traffic has ever hit the
billion mark.
Our honeypots are decoy servers that we’ve set up in countries around the world to gauge trends and
patterns in what’s going on in the global cyber attack landscape. We’ve configured them to look like
actual servers, inviting the type of traffic that hits actual servers. Honeypots are highly effective tools
for collecting information on the methods and target selection processes used by modern attackers.
They can also be a good source of malware samples and shell scripts.

Because honeypots are decoys not otherwise meant for real world use, an incoming connection
registered by a honeypot is either the result of a mistake (someone typing in a wrong IP address,
which is rather uncommon) or of the service being found during an attacker’s scans of the network
or the internet.
We are always improving and upgrading our honeypot network, and doing so can contribute
to increased traffic measurements. Since our last report from H2 20181 we’ve added a few new
honeypots. We’ve also made some improvements to our Telnet and SMB plugins, which results in
better recognition of those events. There’s no doubt that these improvements have contributed
to higher numbers of events, but there’s also no doubt, given the continuing spread in infected IoT
devices,2 the prevalence of Eternal Blue, and increasing numbers of DDoS attacks,3 that attack traffic is
also simply on the increase.
99.9% of traffic to our honeypots is automated traffic coming from bots, malware and other tools.
Attacks may come from any sort of connected computing device – a traditional computer, malwareinfected smartwatch or IoT toothbrush can be a source.

WHO’S AFTER WHO
Where in the world are these attacks taking place? Populating the top ten list of attack source
countries for H1 2019 are, as usual, the US, Russia, Germany and China. However, this is the first time
that traffic volumes from the Chinese IP space has overshadowed other countries to take top spot.
Traffic from China ballooned to 702 million attacks. (A breakdown of the types of traffic from the top
three countries can be found later in this document.)

Also, for the first time, the United Kingdom just missed this list, coming in at number 11. India is a new
entrant to the top ten, lighting up with 44 million attacks, which makes sense given it’s also taken the
distinction of being a top botnet-infected country,4 according to Spamhaus. Philippines, Brazil and
Armenia are also newcomers.
As we always point out, the list of source countries must be taken with a grain of salt. Attackers can
route their attacks through proxies in countries other than where they themselves are located to
avoid identification by law enforcement. In addition, we do not mean to imply that this activity is
predominantly nation state behavior. The majority of these attacks are instigated by cyber criminals
who are carrying out DDoS attacks and sending malware for financial gain.
As usual the US heads the list of top attack destinations. And while the rest of the countries on this
list commonly appear here, just in varying order, Nigeria is new as a top attack destination. Ukraine is
prominent on both source and destination lists, not a surprise given its status as a cyber battlefield5
and a target of Russian hackers.

PORTS AND PROTOCOLS
Of the 2.9 billion hits, 2.1 billion were on TCP ports. Telnet, which is rarely used anymore outside the
realm of IoT devices, saw the greatest volumes during the period. Due to the continuing spread of
infected IoT devices perpetrated by malware such as Mirai, Telnet continues the run it began in the
last half of 2018. The greatest share of Telnet traffic came from the US IP space, followed by Germany,
UK and the Netherlands.
Traffic to port 445 was the next most prevalent, representing SMB worms and exploits such as Eternal
Blue. Since its debut during WannaCry over two years ago, Eternal Blue continues to be used by
criminals, and it’s currently at the height of its popularity.6 Data from our malware labs backs this up,
as WannaCry is currently one of the most prevalent forms of malware in our telemetry. China was the
biggest source of SMB traffic, followed by the Philippines and Russia.
Attacks on SSH port 22 came in third, representing brute force password attempts to gain remote
access to a machine, but also IoT malware, which uses SSH as well. Russia was by far the biggest
aggressor when it comes to SSH traffic.
Traffic to SQL-related ports represent database attacks such as are common in data breaches. But
more recently in a new trend, attacks are also targeting the server with cryptomining bots7 or even
ransomware.8 China was by far the most active country targeting these ports.

Apart from TCP traffic, the majority of the remaining traffic was to UPD port 1900, with 611 million hits.
1900 is commonly used for scanning to determine if the target is running UPnP, or plug-and-play
devices, which are used for exploitation or in DDoS attacks. (TCP port 5431 is one of the UPnP service
ports.) The heaviest traffic on 1900 came from the IP spaces of China, the US, Australia and Brazil.

The graph above shows all activity on all ports throughout the period. The peaks on May 7 and May
29 are due to strong campaigns targeting UDP 1900. The May 7 campaign, which came from the
Australian IP space, hit several countries hard, most prominently Austria, Italy and Ukraine, but also the
United Kingdom, Germany, France and India. The May 29 campaign came from the Chinese IP space
and hit Austria, the UK, US and Ukraine most prominently.
Breaking down the most common ports targeted by the top three attack source countries, it’s
apparent that attackers in all three countries’ IP spaces actively targeted the IoT. On the TCP side,
attackers using the US and Russian IP spaces heavily targeted ports 22 (SSH) and 23 (Telnet). On UDP,
attacks from the Chinese IP space directed at port 1900 were likely attempts to attack a vulnerability
common on D-Link routers.

MALWARE
Malware found in the honeypots is dominated by various versions of Mirai, which is still going strong
three years after it first burst onto the scene in 2016. Mirai targets IoT devices such as IP cameras and
routers, infects those using default credentials, and co-opts them into botnet armies.
In a new trend that should concern every business, Mirai has recently spawned variants that are
specifically engineered to infect enterprise IoT9 devices such as wireless presentation systems
and digital signage TVs. The expansion to enterprise allows attackers access to greater bandwidth
connections than are available with consumer devices, affording them greater power
for DDoS attacks.

Visualization of the top malware variants found in honeypots

Turning away from honeypots to the actual customer endpoints we protect, the main types of
malware we see are still ransomware, banking trojans, and cryptominers.
We’ve seen some evolving trends in the malware sphere in the first half of the year. First, while
ZIP, PDF, DOC and XLS files are the most commonly used attachment type for spreading malware,
we’ve noted10 an increasingly popular trend of attackers employing disc image files (ISO and IMG).
Campaigns using this technique delivered the AgentTesla infostealer and the NanoCore RAT.

We’ve also observed a trend of financially motivated attackers abusing the trust users put in the digital
certificate system by purchasing certificates to sign their executable files.11 Traditionally this sort of
tactic has been limited to the toolbelt of nation states and other highly advanced attackers. It’s just
another example of the trickle down in TTPs from the elites down to the common criminals.
With lower prices of Bitcoin and the shutdown of CoinHive in March, cryptomining appeared to be
on the way out. But recent increases in Bitcoin and other currencies following suit seem to have
prompted a revival in cryptomining. Security researchers are seeing cases of Eternal Blue being used
to escort in XMRig, a Monero miner, as well as mining infections in Android devices in Asia, among
other clues.
After an apparent lull in 2018, ransomware is back and has been busy disrupting companies, public
entities and other organizations over the past several months. Some of the most notable attacks
involved aluminum producer Norsk Hydro,12 who lost over $35 million in the first week after being hit
by LockerGaga in March, and global forensic testing provider Eurofins Scientific, whose compromise
in June affected police work.13
The chart below shows the variety of methods by which threat actors distributed ransomware during
the period. The infection vector used by the greatest share of ransomware families was RDP at 31%,
underscoring the trend of cyber criminals putting more energy into infecting companies. Email spam
was second with 31%; an example is the February and March spam campaigns we noticed14 which used
ZIP files passed off as photos to deliver GranCrab ransomware.

CONCLUSION
Every half year it’s a different story. This time, it’s the jump to billions of honeypot attacks, the
rampant exploitation of IoT devices via Telnet and UPnP, China’s domination of traffic, a comeback
in ransomware and a rally of cryptominers. The attacks may change, the methods may change and
the vulnerabilities may change, but what doesn’t change is that following solid security practices and
procedures will keep your business on much safer ground.
• Map your attack surface. Know what devices and servers you have and why they’re needed.
Retire old assets that aren’t necessary.
• Know what you need to protect most, and guard it. Keep your most critical assets protected
with a higher level of security.
• Keep your systems and applications updated with current software and security patches.
• Be skeptical of unsolicited, unexpected emails and especially of links or attachments in them.
• Enforce a password policy of changing default passwords to unique, long and strong
passwords, and of never reusing passwords. Encourage employees to use password managers.
• Monitor your network with detection and response technology to catch malicious actors
already in the network.
