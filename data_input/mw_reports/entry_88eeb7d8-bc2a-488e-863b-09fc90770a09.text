Attracting more than a half-million annual readers, this is the security community's go-to
destination for technical breakdowns of the latest threats, critical vulnerability disclosures
and cutting-edge research.
Email scammers always seem to invent new ways of trickery to gain cash from their victims.
We recently came across a case where the scammer reused some existing scripts to phish
and scam - copy and paste style. With a bit of modification, the script works like
ransomware, without the hassle of having to compile a portable executable. This screen
locker ransomware variant locks the user's screen and demand a ransom rather than the
typical file encryption style ransomware. The ransom demanded in this case was in the form
of Google Play Cards.

Below is an overview of the process from the email hyperlinks, file downloads, to how these
files are installed and work in the victim’s computer.

Figure 1. From Scripts to Scams
The scam starts with an email. Recently, have seen an email spam campaign pretending to
be an important update for your computer. The email "From:" address is:
help@supportwindows followed by some digits.
In the first email sample, the hyperlink provided will directly download a batch file,
WindowsUpdate.bat

Figure 2. An email written in French, and translated in English, asking the user to update its
computer.
In the second email sample, the hyperlink uses a short URL service that leads to a
WordPress website.

Should the victim click the hyperlink provided by the second email sample will redirect to the
WordPress web page below:

Figure 4. The WordPress website posing as Windows Support.
Clicking the ‘Microsoft’ image will download WindowsUpdate.bat and hitting the ‘Download
Now’ button downloads the key.rar archive file. Should the victim decide to open the
downloaded archive file, they will see two script files. Files named as License1.bat and
License2.vbs.

Figure 5. The keys to scamming
In the first email sample, the hyperlink provided will download the WindowsUpdate.bat.
The file in the archive, License1.bat is the same as the WindowsUpdate.bat. This is a
modified script from an old one that was uploaded in pastebin.com way back in 2017. The
script can be viewed here

script
The batch file serves as the installation file. Running this command batch file will drop
another VBS and two batch files in the User Startup Folder. These scripts will automatically
be executed when the computer starts.

The file from archive License2.vbs and the created file startup1.vbs are the same. This
script will open a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser on full screen mode, hiding the
address, menu and status bar and navigate to hxxp://whoawareness[.]com/?page_id=93.

Figure 8. It is like pressing F11 button in the keyboard. That is the trick.
Either the computer boots up and startup1.vbs is triggered, or License2.vbs is executed
from the key.rar archive. The victim is now tricked into thinking that their computer is
‘blocked’.

Figure 9. Works a bit like a ransom note.
And a notification appears:

Further down, the web page asks you to purchase a Google Play Store Card worth 100
Euros to activate a new license for your computer and provides a video on how to scratch
off this card. The scammers list and provide a cellphone screenshot of stores where you
can buy these cards.

Finally, the scammers ask you to fill out the form with your personal information together
with the Google Play Card Code.

Figure 13. Phishing and Scam
With a Google Play balance, you can buy Apps, Books, Movies, Music, Newsstand, and
Subscriptions that are offered in Google Play Store. The other remaining two files created
in the User Startup Folder:
startup1.bat – Since this script was reused and modified, it is intended to change each
internet browsers home page for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox by
modifying the registry. Both of the URLs listed in the script were already inaccessible at the
time of analysis.
startup2.bat – Terminates Windows Explorer.

As we were going to publish this, we noticed the WordPress site at whoawareness.com had
changed. It is now using scare tactics, especially noticeable when your audio volume is on
high. It has an image of the detected threats in your machine, where the window structure is
evidently from Windows XP. Then there are two message boxes, a fake system alert, and
the other a phishing form that asks you to key in your username and password.

Remember, updates for your computer never really arrive from email notifications, they just
pop-up around your task bar waiting for you to click, install and restart. And if your Microsoft
Windows Activation License is invalid, a text will appear on the right-hand bottom of your
desktop window. Simply avoid or ignore these amateurish unsolicited emails that alert you
that you need an update.
