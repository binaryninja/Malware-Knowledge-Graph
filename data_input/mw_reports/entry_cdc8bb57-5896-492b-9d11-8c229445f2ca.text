Hi

A client of mine got infected by something that looks like the Gomasom ransomware, but the
end files are all in *.tar

Here are 2 zip files, one with crypted files and the other with the same file from and old
offline backup.

Any idea how to decryp this?

Thanks
Olivier

There was no instruction for decryp left on the computer. I wrote to the email using a random
email and here is their answer
Good day
Your files were encrypted/locked
As evidence can decrypt file 1 to 3 1-30MB
The price of the transcripts of all the files on the server: 7 Bitcoin
Recommend to solve the problem quickly and not to delay
Also give advice on how to protect Your server against threats from the network
(Files sql mdf backup decryption strictly after payment)!

You can submit samples of encrypted files and ransom notes to ID Ransomware for
assistance with identification and confirmation. This is a service that helps identify what
ransomware may have encrypted your files and then attempts to direct you to an appropriate
support topic where you can seek further assistance. Uploading both encrypted files and
ransom notes together provides a more positive match and helps to avoid false detections. If
ID Ransomware cannot identify the infection, you can post the case SHA1 it gives you for
Demonslay335 to manually inspect the files.

Samples of any encrypted files, ransom notes or suspicious executables (installer, malicious
files, attachments) that you suspect were involved in causing the infection can be submitted
here (http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/submit-malware.php?channel=168) with a link to
this topic. Doing that will be helpful with analyzing and investigating by our crypto experts.

ID Ransomware cannot identify the ransomware.
SHA1 is fd65d1e0b248c8ec254ab3086f5877ff2065d72a
Sending the files to your second link right now.

Ok.
After our experts examine the files, they will post in this topic if they can assist or need
further information.

Interesting, I have not seen a ransomware use ".tar". It isn't a valid Tar archive either. Can
you also upload the ransom note to ID Ransomware so I can archive it?
Thanks for the sample mike1. Has any further analysis been done on it already? It crashed
on my VM. I see RakhniDecryptor lists it, but it stated unsupported when I selected this
user's files.

There is no ransom note anywhere. All we figure out was to try to write to the email

Tech support at Kaspersky Lab said that can not decrypted.
