The OceanLotus, an APT group said to have a Vietnamese background, was ﬁrst
exposed and named by SkyEye Labs (the predecessor of the RedDrip team of QiAnXin
Threat Intelligence Center) in May 2015. Its attack activities can be traced back to April
2012 with initial targets including Chinese maritime institutions, maritime construction,
scientiﬁc research institutes and shipping enterprises. Their targets expanded to almost
all important organizations afterwards and related activities are still active now.
The RedDrip Team (@RedDrip7) keeps a close eye on activities made by OceanLotus.
Last month we released an in-depth analysis report: OceanLotus’ Attacks to Indochinese
Peninsula: Evolution of Targets, Techniques and Procedure. Currently we capture
another attack incident targeting a Vietnamese environmentalist with new malware
payload and hope the revealed details could lead to more ﬁndings in the future.

Bait Analysis
The bait sample is a zip archive in Vietnamese: Thông tin về chuyên đề môi
trường_Nhờ anh Đặng Vũ Lượng tư vấn thêm.zip
From the contents of the compressed package, the three pictures named in Vietnamese
meaning "illustration" respectively show that there is garbage in the rivers in Vietnam,
the factories are exhausting smoke everywhere, and the stinking ditch is all garbage. All
these pictures make people feel disgusting. At the same time, it shows the importance of
mandatory waste classiﬁcation.

In addition to the picture, the main attack sample is an hta script named as Van nan moi
truong Viet Nam hien nay va giai phap khac phuc hau qua_Phuong huong trong thoi
gian toi.

It can be seen that both the bait name from the compressed package and the bait name
as the attack sample are consistent with the scene of attacking the person in charge of
the environmental protection organization.
Therefore, we will characterize this attack as: Oceanlotus attacked the head of an
environmental protection organization in Vietnam.

Sample Analysis
Execution process of the sample used by OceanLotus this time is roughly as follows:
1. The hta sample decrypts and loads subsequent additional data.
2. Utilize DLL Side-Loading to take advantage of adobe reader to load the payload
and then connects to the C2.

Payload Analysis
The hta script has been obfuscated and will replace ",", ".", " " with "+", "/", "=" ﬁrst:

Figure 2.1 The confused hta script
The script is generated by using the cactusTorch framework
(https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/CACTUSTORCH), which ﬁrst decrypts the
Loader module, then decrypts the attached data through the Loader module, and ﬁnally
executes the decrypted shellcode in memory:

Figure 2.2 Loading Loader in Memory
The parameters passed to the Loader's "X" function are as follows:
WinShusWenTun.X ( 1632689155 ,31529 ,194,1292962 )
The meaning of each parameter is as follows:

Loader Analysis
The decrypted Loader module is named L.dll. The function of the dll is mainly to decrypt
and load the appended data behind the hta:

Figure 2.4 Some functions of Loader
The X function is mainly to encrypt and load the shellcode; the decoding algorithm is
base64 and then performs XOR decryption with the key in single byte, and the key is
passed by the parameter:

Figure 2.5 X function of L.dll
The key here is 1632689155 (0x6150DC03). From the algorithm, only the ﬁrst 3 bytes
(0x03, 0xdc, 0x50) are used in while performing XOR decryption:

Figure 2.6 L.dll decryption function
Then the decrypted data is executed in memory:

Figure 2.7 function B of L.dll
The function of the shellcode executed by Loader is mainly to release the ﬁle and
achieve persistence. As can be seen from the code features, OceanLotus often uses the
shellcode to perform attacks.

Figure 2.8 Shellcode frequently used by OceanLotus
After shellcode is loaded in memory, it will load the dll ﬁle in memory after execution.

Figure 2.9 Loading Dll into memory by shellcode
Subsequently released ﬁles are stored in the resource, and the PE ﬁle to be released is
extracted from the resource data through RtlDecompressBuffer:

Figure 2.10 Get the address of the decompression API
The resource names are 0x65 and 0x66. As shown in the ﬁgure, if the 0x65 resource
does not exist, it will get 0x66 resource instead.

Figure 2.11 Obtaining resource data
The obtained resource data is as follows, including the ﬁle name, ﬁle size, and
compressed data:

Then get the exe and dll ﬁle names in system32, Program File and Windows directory,
insert them into the array, then randomly generate a random number, randomly select a
ﬁle in the array, get the ﬁle name and ﬁle description of the ﬁle as the name of the
dropped exe ﬁle and related folder name respectively:

If rasman.dll is randomly selected, it will get the ﬁle description as the name of the folder
where the malicious code was released. Here is the Create Remote Access Connection

Then release the 10 ﬁles decrypted in the resource to the newly created directory; in our
case the released directory name is: "C:Program FilesRemote Access Connection
Manager", which is based on the description of the ﬁle randomly selected.
The name of the exe ﬁle is the name of the randomly selected ﬁle.
Rasman.db3 is the shellcode to be loaded.

Then it will be written into the registry run item to achieve persistence.
At the same time, an empty docx ﬁle will be created under temp folder and then opened,
so that the victim thinks that it is a docx ﬁle:

Figure 3.1 Version information of rasman.exe
Rasman.exe will load dlls in the same directory by default, including AGM.dll, BIB.dll,
CoolType.dll and ACE.dll, which could lead to DLL Side-Loading:

Figure 3.2 Import table information of rasman.exe
The code of the 4 dlls is the same, is the hijacked dll, will be loaded by rasman.exe
program by default. Although 4 dlls have the opportunity to execute dllmain, the only dll
that loads the next stage payload is CoolType.dll because the attacker designed a ﬂag
variable to control whether the next stage payload needs to be loaded:

The code at the entrance of AGM.dll indicates the two if judgments will not enter,
because the value of ﬂag is 0x8f, which is greater than the ﬁrst two judgments, so the
subsequent payload will not be loaded:

Figure 3.3 DllMain function of AGM.dll
The code of the CoolType.dll code is 0x27, which is less than 0x46, so it will enter the
ﬁrst if condition and execute fun_LoadExportFun:

The function of fun_LoadExportFun is mainly to cover large code at the entrance of exe,
loop into the garbage code appearing in the conﬁguration, the size is 0x20610 bytes,
then add the code 0xff, 0x15 at the end, and ﬁnally connect the address of the export
function of AGM_5, only In order to ﬁnally execute the code that loads the shellcode:

Figure 3.5 fun_LoadExportFun
When the program returns to the exe process space, it will jump back to the code range
covered by fun_LoadExportFun to continue running, and ﬁnally execute the AGM_5
function, mainly to avoid being traced back to the execution ﬂow:

Figure 3.6 A lot of padding code
When AGM_5 is executed, it ﬁrst hides all the child windows of the process, then reads
the ﬁle with the sufﬁx of db3 (here rasman.db3) with the same ﬁle name in the same
directory, and ﬁnally performs execution:

Figure 3.7 Loading shellcode for rasman.db3
The loaded shellcode is a variant of the Denis family used by OceanLotus:

Figure 3.8 Contents of rasman.db3
Then it connects to udt.sophiahoule.com and establish C2 communication, which
eventually causes the computer to be controlled:

Figure 3.9 Captured network packets
The characteristics of this malicious code:
1. Insert the encrypted data to the end of the hta script to avoid the existence of
multiple ﬁles.
2. The released ﬁles are randomly named according to the ﬁle name and ﬁle
description selected from the compromised computer, so as to avoid being easily
acquired in forensics.

3. Only select one of the dll ﬁles while performing DLL Side-Loading, and ﬁll the exe
entry point with junk code and then do a jump operation to avoid stack traceback.
4. Enlarge the ﬁle size to avoid being uploaded automatically.

Conclusion
The OceanLotus reﬂects a very strong confrontational ability and willing to attack by
keep evolving their techniques, including approaches to deliver bait documents, changes
of the payloads, measures in circumvention, as well as domain assets, no matter the
target is domestic or overseas. Due to the transnational nature of most APT groups, it is
difﬁcult to eliminate threats from the root cause. Therefore, tracking these APT attacks
and adopting confrontation measures will exist for a long time. All we can do is to
continuously improve our own discovery and containment capabilities, then will be able
to overwhelming opponents technically.
At present, all QiAnXin products can protect users from this new attack carried out by
OceanLotus.
