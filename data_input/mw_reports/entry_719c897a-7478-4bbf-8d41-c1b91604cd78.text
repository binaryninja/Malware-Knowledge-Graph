We have all seen the current upsurge in Ransomware attacks. It has been covered on an
international scale, with new variants appearing at a very fast pace, some target Windows,
some target Macs and some have cross platform capabilities.
Recently a major healthcare organization fell victim to Ransomware, and surely there are
more high profile victims to come. Enterprises face an ever growing threat landscape and the
majority of businesses do not report or acknowledge having become a victim of
Ransomware. This is due to the possible repercussions, such as loss of customer
confidence, degraded reputation and embarrassment, which leads to an inevitable loss of
profit and business.
Cyber-criminals are aware of these repercussions and have crafted their attacks to include
threats such as releasing specific information related to victims, as we saw with Chimera
Ransomware, utilizing a type of cyber-extortion to ensure they achieve their objective of
being paid the ransom. Cyber criminals select targets that may give in to their demands, and
targeting a major health care organization is more than likely going to generate a paid
ransom.

Cyber criminals continue to use exploit kits to infect victims with ransomware but they also
use MALSPAM emails to lure possible victims – a key vector into an enterprise environment
that lacks the proper security controls, and one with insufficient information security training
for end users. Some examples are email messages claiming to be in regards to an overdue
bill or invoice, utilizing such terminology in the subject line and given file name, such as
invoice.zip or payment_doc_298427.zip
The email seen below is an example how the orchestrated attack is carried out (thanks to
Conrad Longmore for the email example):

Dear Client! For the third time we are reminding you about your unpaid debt. You used

and responsibly. Otherwise we will have to start a legal action against you.
Respectfully, Jennie bowles Chief Accountant 707 Monroe St FL 58833 928-429-4994

The emails usually contain a ZIP file which contains a malicious script/downloader. Upon
running this specific malicious script/downloader I was greeted by Teslacrypt ransomware
(69.exe) from hellomississmithqq[.]com / IP: 54.212.162.6 (both currently blocked by
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Malicious Website protection).

Ransomware is not going away, on the contrary it is becoming more and more prevalent with
new variants coming out at a fast pace and targeting multiple platforms.
It is recommended that users are using anti-malware protection, especially one that has a
website protection option. Malwarebytes has an Anti-Ransomware Beta product that blocks
most Ransomware attacks. Furthermore it is recommended that users are ever vigilant and
not click on URL links in suspicious emails, and do not open any files contained in these
emails. Ensure to keep proper backups as most Ransomware deletes Windows shadow
copies.
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware detects this Teslacrypt sample and its malicious website
protection blocks the download domain / Command & Control domains as well.
