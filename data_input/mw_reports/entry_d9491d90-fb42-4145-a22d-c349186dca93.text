Obtaining user operating system (OS) credentials from a targeted device is among threat
actors’ primary goals when launching attacks because these credentials serve as a gateway
to various objectives they can achieve in their target organization’s environment, such as
lateral movement. One technique attackers use is targeting credentials in the Windows Local
Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory because it can store not
only a current user’s OS credentials but also a domain admin’s.
LSASS credential dumping was first observed in the tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) of several sophisticated threat activity groups—including actors that Microsoft tracks
as HAFNIUM and GALLIUM— and has become prevalent even in the cybercrime space,
especially with the rise of the ransomware as a service gig economy. Detecting and stopping
OS credential theft is therefore important because it can spell the difference between
compromising or encrypting one device versus an entire network. Security solutions must

provide specific measures and capabilities to help harden the LSASS process—for example,
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has advanced detections and a dedicated attack surface
reduction rule (ASR) to block credential stealing from LSASS.
In May 2022, Microsoft participated in an evaluation conducted by independent testing
organization AV-Comparatives specifically on detecting and blocking the LSASS credential
dumping technique. The test, which evaluated several endpoint protection platforms (EPP)
and endpoint detection and response (EDR) vendors, is the first time AV-Comparatives
focused on a single attack technique, and we’re happy to report that Defender for Endpoint
passed all 15 test cases used to dump user OS credentials from the LSASS process,
achieving 100% detection and prevention scores. Notably, we also passed all test cases
with only Defender for Endpoint’s default settings configured, that is, with LSASS ASR
and Protective Process Light (PPL) turned off to validate our antivirus protection durability in
itself. Such results demonstrate our continued commitment to provide organizations with
industry-leading defense.
In this blog, we share examples of various threat actors that we’ve recently observed using
the LSASS credential dumping technique. We also provide details on the testing
methodology done by AV-Comparatives, which they also shared in their blog and detailed
report. Finally, we offer additional recommendations to further harden systems and prevent
attackers from taking advantage of possible misconfigurations should they fail to leverage
credential dumping.

LSASS credential dumping: What we see in the wild
Dumping LSASS credentials is important for attackers because if they successfully dump
domain passwords, they can, for example, then use legitimate tools such as PsExec or
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to move laterally across the network. They
can also use techniques like pass-the-hash for lateral movement if they manage to obtain the
password hashes.
Microsoft researchers are constantly monitoring the threat landscape, including the different
ways threat actors attempt to steal user credentials. The table below is a snapshot of the
most popular credential theft techniques these actors used from March to August 2022
based on our threat data:

Procdump.exe (with -ma command line

DEV-0555

Taskmgr.exe

DEV-0300

The first column shows the technique attackers most frequently used in their attempt to
dump credentials from LSASS, while the second column shows which threat actor uses this
technique most frequently. Based on the incidents we tracked from March to August 2022,
credential theft attacks using LOLBins such as comsvc.dll, procdump.exe, or taskmgr.exe
are still popular. These LOLBins are legitimate, digitally signed binaries that are either
already present on the target device or are downloaded onto the system for the attacker to
misuse for malicious activities.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus prevents the execution of these command lines due to its
synchronous command line-blocking capabilities.

AV-Comparatives test
To evaluate EPP and EDR capabilities against the LSASS credential dumping technique, AVComparatives ran 15 different test cases to dump credentials from the LSASS process using
both publicly available hacking tools like Mimikatz (which the tester modified to bypass
antivirus signatures) and privately developed ones. These test cases were as follows:

Each test case implemented a comprehensive approach on how to dump credentials from
LSASS. After the evaluation, AV-Comparatives shared the logs and detailed description of
the test cases. Microsoft participated using Defender for Endpoint, both its antivirus and EDR
capabilities, with only the default settings configured.
During the initial run, Defender for Endpoint prevented 11 out of 15 test cases and
alerted/detected three of the remaining ones (Figure 1). We then made improvements in our
protection and detection capabilities and asked AV-Comparatives to re-test the missed test
cases. During the re-test, we prevented all the remaining four test cases, achieving 15 out of
15 prevention score.

Figure 1. Table showing how Defender for Endpoint prevented/detected the test cases in the
first run of the AV-Comparatives test. The antivirus module missed test cases 01, 03, 09, and
10. We added improvements to the product based on these findings, thus allowing Defender
for Endpoint to achieve 100% prevention score on re-test. (Source: AV-Comparatives)

We’d like to thank AV-Comparatives for this thorough test, which led us to improve our
protection and detection capabilities in Defender for Endpoint. These improvements have
already been rolled out to benefit our customers, and we’re looking forward to the next
similar test. We aim to provide industry-leading, cross-domain defense, so it’s important for
us to participate in tests like AV-Comparatives and MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations
because they help us ensure that we’re delivering solutions that empower organizations to
defend their environments.

Securing the LSASS process with coordinated threat defense and
system hardening
The continuous evolution of the threat landscape has seen attacks leveraging OS credential
theft, and threat actors will continue to find new ways to dump LSASS credentials in their
attempts to evade detection. For Microsoft, our industry-leading defense capabilities in
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint are able to detect such attempts. We’ve also introduced new
security features in Windows 11 to harden the operating system, such as enabling PPL for
the LSASS process and Credential Guard by default. However, evaluations like this AVComparatives test go hand in hand with threat monitoring and research because they
provide security vendors additional insights and opportunities to continuously improve
capabilities.
Our teams performed an in-house test of all these test cases with the LSASS ASR rule
enabled to check the protection level of that rule. We’re happy to report that the ASR rule
alone successfully prevented all the tested techniques. The LSASS ASR rule is a generic yet
effective protection our customers can implement to stop currently known user-mode LSASS
credential dumping attacks. Defender customers should therefore enable this ASR rule—
along with tamper protection—as an added protection layer for the LSASS process.
On top of the various dumping techniques, we’ve also observed threat actors attempt to
weaken the device settings in case they can’t dump credentials. For example, they attempt
to enable “UseLogonCredential” in WDigest registry, which enables plaintext passwords in
memory. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects such techniques, too, as
Behavior:Win32/WDigestNegMod.B.
Windows administrators can also perform the following to further harden the LSASS process
on their devices:
Enable PPL for LSASS process; note that for new, enterprise-joined Windows 11
installs (22H2 update), this is already enabled by default
Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard; this is also now enabled by default for
organizations using the Enterprise edition of Windows 11
Enable restricted admin mode for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Disable “UseLogonCredential” in WDigest

on hardening environments:
