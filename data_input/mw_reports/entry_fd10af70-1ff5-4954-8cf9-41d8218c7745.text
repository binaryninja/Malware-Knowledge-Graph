What to Expect When You’re Electing: Preparing for
Cyber Threats to the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections
mandiant.com/resources/blog/2022-midterm-election-threats

Securing the individuals, organizations, and infrastructure involved in elections from
malicious cyber activity continues to be a challenge in an ever-evolving threat landscape as
the number of threat actors targeting this important democratic process has grown over the
years.Elections face the range of the adversary motivations and operations that Mandiant
tracks across the globe—espionage threats, destructive and disruptive attacks, information
operations, and criminal extortion.
The particulars of why an actor might target a specific election vary, and the lack of
frequency of elections that an actor might decide to target can make it challenging to
anticipate who, what, and how. As we observed in 2020, when Iranian actors impersonated
the ‘Proud Boys’ organization to send threatening emails to voters in Florida, new election
cycles can bring new threat activity, even if low effort. With an eye toward historic threat
activity here and abroad, we can leverage past observations to prepare for and respond to a
range of threats to the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections should they materialize.
Mandiant assess with moderate confidence that cyber threat activity surrounding the midterm
elections will cause disruptions and divisiveness, but we believe notable compromises of
actual voting devices or other activity impacting the integrity of votes is unlikely.

In particular, we will likely see information operations (IO) that target U.S. populations
around the election. We believe that Russia, Iran, and China remain the most
significant foreign IO threats, having observed numerous examples of information
operations that we suspected to support Russian, Iranian, and Chinese interests
commenting on U.S. politics and 2020 candidates and issues, including activity
intended to intimidate or influence voters.
During the lead up to elections—as recent activity demonstrates—ongoing IO
campaigns may pivot their messaging to focus on relevant political issues as part of
their broader aims of sowing divisions within the U.S. populace, undermining
democratic institutions, and promoting narratives aligned with each respective
campaign’s interests.
We are also highly confident that espionage campaigns will target U.S. election
organizations, infrastructure, political parties, government, and other related groups
and individuals. We have tracked activity from groups associated with Russia, China,
Iran, North Korea, and other nations targeting organizations and individuals related to
elections in the U.S. and/or other nations with apparent goals ranging from information
collection and establishing footholds or stealing data for later activity to one known
case of a destructive attack against critical election infrastructure.
During the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential election cycles, we observed significant,
multi-pronged campaigns involving information operations, including those supported
by cyber intrusion activity.
We assess with moderate confidence that disruptive and/or destructive activity, such as
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or ransomware, will impact government
and election-related organizations and infrastructure.

Recently Observed IO Activity Highlights Campaigns’ Pivot to
Promotion of Narratives Around the 2022 Midterm Elections
Mandiant recently observed activity by three separate IO campaigns promoting narratives
pertaining to U.S. political issues, including those surrounding the 2022 U.S. midterm
elections. IO campaigns often involve the ongoing promotion of content targeting political
discourse, including that supporting specific stances or politicians outside election cycles.
Previously identified IO activity targeting the U.S. and attributed to foreign actors has shown
attempts to influence local or regional politics. While this may not directly correlate with a
given actor’s interest in influencing a midterm election, such demonstrations at least signal
their interest in influencing U.S. politics at the sub-national level. For example, various
Russia-linked online and real-life influence activity has had local and regional U.S. targeting,
including support for successionist movements in states like California and Texas.

“Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens” (NAEBC)

Mandiant has observed continued activity by two inauthentic personas, “Niels Holst” and
“Alan Krupka,” that previously claimed to be editors at the inauthentic news website NAEBC.
According to a Reuters article citing a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation,
NAEBC was run by individuals associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA).
While the news site itself is no longer accessible, a limited subset of the personas that we
linked to the site remain active, and promote content targeting U.S. right-leaning audiences
on the Gab social media platform. Recently, these personas have promoted narratives
related to current U.S. political topics, including the midterm elections, the economy, energy
prices, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both persona accounts post semi-regularly, often
reposting content from other seemingly unaffiliated users interspersed with seemingly
original posts created by the accounts' operators.

DRAGONBRIDGE
Mandiant assesses with high confidence that social media accounts associated with
DRAGONBRIDGE, an information operations campaign we judged to be operating in support
of the political interests of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), are promoting content
negatively portraying the U.S. political system and commenting on a range of domestic
political, social, and economic issues, including on topics related to the 2022 U.S. midterm
elections. Accounts highlighted economic and social issues facing the U.S., and portrayed
the country as riven by political infighting and polarization. Utilizing a tactic first observed
during DRAGONBRIDGE messaging targeting Western rare earths mining companies, some
accounts posted comments using first-person pronouns to feign concern, implying that they
were American.

EvenPolitics
Mandiant identified and reported to our customers on what we assessed with high
confidence to be an inauthentic news site, EvenPolitics, promoted by a network of
coordinated and inauthentic social media accounts, including those posing as U.S.
individuals. We further assessed with low confidence that EvenPolitics and social media
accounts promoting the site are operated in support of Iranian political interests. While the
social media accounts have since been suspended, EvenPolitics has continued to publish
articles including those on election-related topics, such as polling models forecasting
potential election results, the Georgia Senate race, the Republican primary race for U.S.
Representative Liz Cheney’s seat, the Arizona Republican gubernatorial primary race, and
the Forward political party. As with other EvenPolitics articles, content appears to have been
plagiarized and altered from original news articles published by mainstream media outlets
such as The Week and The Guardian.

individuals from both sides of the U.S. political spectrum

Activity Around Previous U.S. Midterm Elections
Mandiant has identified and reported on information operations serving foreign interests
during the last three U.S. election cycles. For example, the pro-Iran "Distinguished
Impersonator" influence campaign leveraged inauthentic personas impersonating U.S.
political candidates running for office during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections to promote
desired narratives. The campaign also successfully published letters, blog posts, and guest
columns in local U.S. news outlets and leveraged inauthentic journalist personas to conduct
interviews with real individuals which the interviewees expressed views in line with Iranian
interests.

Cyber Espionage
Based on recently observed activity patterns and/or past election targeting, including U.S.
races, we anticipate that APT41, APT31, APT29, and APT42 are likely to target U.S.
government and other election-related organizations. We suggest that this list could
represent a useful guide for prioritizing defensive strategies and hunt missions for relevant
government, civil society, media, and technology organizations ahead of the 2022 U.S.
midterm election. However, this list should not be viewed as comprehensive; it is possible
that additional known actors or previously unobserved groups will also engage in relevant
cyber threat activity.

Mandiant observed multiple
APT41 campaigns targeting U.S. state
governments in 2021, including this
campaign, which involved exploitation
of vulnerabilities in USAHERDS and
Log4J.

In July and August 2016, APT41
targeted Hong Kong media outlets
using SOGU malware ahead of the
legislative council election. The group
likely targeted media organizations with
spear-phishing campaigns due to their
pro-democracy editorial content.

APT31

Google reported that it successfully
blocked an APT31 phishing campaign
targeting "high-profile Gmail users
affiliated with the U.S. government" in
February 2022.

In June 2020, Google reported that
APT31 targeted staff of the Biden
campaign with phishing attempts. In
October 2020, Google reported
additional APT31 phishing of Biden
campaign staff using spoofed McAfee
credential collection attempts.

APT29

Mandiant continues to detect and
report APT29 phishing campaigns and
third-party compromises that primarily
appear to be targeting diplomatic and
foreign policy entities in Europe and
the Americas.

According to open sources, APT29
compromised the Democratic National
Committee (DNC) ahead of the 2016
U.S. election, likely separately from
APT28's concurrent compromise.

APT42

Between March and June
2021, APT42 used a compromised
email account of a U.S.-based think
tank to target Middle East researchers
at similar organizations, U.S.
government officials involved in Middle
East and Iran policy, and other
individuals.

Microsoft and Google independently
reported Iranian threat activity targeting
U.S. election campaign staff and others
in late 2019 and summer 2020.
Mandiant believes that both reports
refer to APT42 activity.

Cybercrime
Many election-related organizations are also at risk of being targeted or impacted by
ransomware and other types of cybercrime. Though this activity may not be driven by threat
actors seeking to disrupt the electoral process due to political motivations, nonetheless it
could impact business processes that may have cascading impacts to execution of the
election. However, state-sponsored or affiliated threat actors such as UNC2448 may also
leverage ransomware under the guise of financially motivated activity to disrupt the electoral
process.

Hacktivism
Hacktivists may be motivated by election-related issues to conduct activities such as data
leaks or website defacements with the intent of expressing a viewpoint or causing
disruptions. Examples include a November 2020 data leak by a Portuguese hacktivist group
that leaked what appeared to be old and possibly fabricated data regarding a Brazilian
election and an Iranian hacktivist defacing a U.S. commercial website to display messages
critical of the U.S. in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. We also note that nation
state-sponsored actors have a history of leveraging false hacktivist fronts as a tactic to

support their operations, including those targeting elections. For example, the false hacktivist
persona Guccifer 2.0 was leveraged by Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the General
Staff (GRU) as part of its targeting of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Insider Threats
Insider Threats have become a concern for election officials. In 2021, a judge barred an
elected county official from supervising any future elections after it came to light that the
official had allowed an individual not affiliated with the election commission to photograph
and publish confidential voting-machine passwords, as well as making copies of the hard
drives and changing settings on the machine that introduced security vulnerabilities into the
process. Similar incidents have occurred in other states, speaking to a concerning rise in
security breaches by insiders.

The Targets—The Election Ecosystem
Just as there are a broad array of threat actors, there is a diversity to where (and how) cyber
threats to elections might play out. Cyber espionage and cyber attacks from state-sponsored
actors, information operations, hacktivism, and even cybercrime can all pose a threat to
entities evolved in elections in different ways.

Figure 4: Targets of threat activity
At a high level, the attack surface of an election involves election systems and infrastructure,
election administrators and entities involved in running the election, and organizations
involved in the political campaigning process—to include news and media organizations that
might be exploited or leveraged by threat actors. The ease of targeting and nature of threat
activity (cyber espionage, information operations, extortion, etc.) can vary across entities
within these categories.

Challenges and Considerations
In comparison with safeguarding other types of infrastructure or potential targets, election
administrators and security practitioners face some unique challenges. It is important to
emphasize that not all these threats represent an equal risk in impact to the electoral
process.

Event-specific activity: The reasons why a certain actor might target an election
might vary from one event to another. In observance of election-related IO activity,
presidential and general elections seem to be targeted at higher volume than midterms,
based on the limited sample size of Mandiant and public third-party reporting. However,
this assessment may be influenced by attention bias; it is likely that more defenders
spend more time hunting for activity surrounding presidential and general elections
than regional, local, or midterm elections.
Assessing intent: One challenge in assessing risk from threat actors targeting
elections is that the targeting of certain entities (such as state infrastructure) could be
for purposes other than election-related threat activity; simultaneously though, a
foothold in such infrastructure could also be leveraged in the future for election-centric
activity. Visibility into specific data or victims targeted, as well as historical missions’
taskings attributed to a specific group may provide additional insight into adversary
motivations.
Communication of threats: As trust in the electoral process is essential,
communication of the details of an ongoing incident that may occur during an election
—with stakeholders being the broader public—increases the complexity of response.
Timely communication of what targets were impacted and in what manner becomes an
important component in ensuring trust in the process that election administrators must
navigate.
A historical understanding of threats to election participants and infrastructure—and global
visibility into current operations by threat actors that have demonstrated an interest in
targeting elections—can prove valuable for security teams to scope, prioritize, and anticipate
future threat emergence. Threat intelligence that informs and provides visibility into the
recent tools, tactics, and procedures of such threat actors in other operations can better arm
election defenders. Organizations can operationalize such insights to proactively harden
networks and potential targets to better prepare for threats to this critical democratic process.
