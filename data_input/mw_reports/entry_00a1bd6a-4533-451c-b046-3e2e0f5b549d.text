Shrouded Crossbow Creators Behind BIFROSE for UNIX

March 1, 2016

We recently came across a variant of the BIFROSE malware that has been rewritten for
UNIX and UNIX-like systems. This is the latest tool developed by attackers behind operation
Shrouded Crossbow, which have produced other BIFROSE variants such as KIVARS and
KIVARS x64. UNIX-based operating systems are widely used in servers, workstations, and
even mobile devices. With a lot of highly confidential data found in these servers and
devices, a UNIX version of BIFROSE can certainly be classified as a threat.
Capable Hands
BIFROSE has been updated by Shrouded Crossbow specifically for the campaigns they
pursue. Some of their victims have already been compromised by both Windows and UNIX
versions of BIFROSE. Historically, Shrouded Crossbow has used BIFROSE to target
privatized government agencies, government offices, and government contractors, as well as
companies in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financial industries.

BIFROSE was developed by ksv as a trojan known to have infected
Windows 95 through Windows 7.

2010

Shrouded Crossbow developed KIVARS 2010 – Dropped by malware
detected as TROJ_FAKEWORD.A (SHA1
218be0da023e7798d323e19e950174f53860da15) and only affects 32-bit
systems Only encrypts the “MZ” magic byte for the backdoor payload

2013

Shrouded Crossbow developed KIVARS x64 Can work in 32-bit and 64-bit
environments Payload is now encrypted using the modified RC4

2014

Shrouded Crossbow developed UNIX BIFROSE

UNIX BIFROSE
UNIX BIFROSE was created after the Shrouded Crossbow rewrote BIFROSE and compiled
it into an Executable and Link Format (ELF) which is a standard executable file for UNIX and
UNIX-like systems. Its code is completely changed compared to the Windows version, but
still having almost the same protocol and command-and-control (C&C) commands. Both
Windows and UNIX versions can communicate with the original Bifrost C&C server. One big
difference between the Windows and UNIX version is that UNIX BIFROSE has less backdoor
functions compared to the original BIFROSE.
PHONE HOME PACKETS FOR UNIX AND WINDOWS
UNIX
<victim IP>|unix|<hostname>|<username>|5.0.0.0|0|1|1|0|575|0|0|0|0|None|||||
Windows
<victim IP>|default_zz|<hostname>|
<username>|2.0.0a||1|-1|0|2600|1|1|0|0|982bc1da|C:\Documents and
Settings\Administrator\Recent|C:\Documents and
Settings\Administrator\Desktop|C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My
Documents|US|00000409|
In the phone home packet, BIFROSE will register with a default assigned name on C&C. The
default name for the Windows version of BIFROSE is default_zz, whereas for UNIX, the
default name is unix. The attacker can easily change these names at a later time. The initial
malware installed will be 2.0.0a for Windows, and 5.0.0.0. for UNIX. The Windows version,
once connected to the c&c server, will contain the disk serial number, locale, and keyboard
layout that identifies the victims and helps the attackers manage the tools needed for the
attack. The However, the previously mentioned information will not be available for the UNIX
version.
UNIX BIFROSE also provides a “create remote shell” which is perfect for skilled attackers
who are familiar with the UNIX system.

Malware Crossing Platforms
After testing the UNIX BIFROSE version, we figured out that it has no problem
communicating with the BIFROSE server console used by the original BIFROSE (the
Windows version). Our research indicates that a network can be infected by both Windows
and UNIX versions of the malware. This ensures that regardless of OS used by the victim,
the threat actor is ready and able to capture and communicate with any server.
With BIFROSE used as a component for recent targeted attacks, we studied the new variant
to see its strength in a sustained attack. UNIX BIFROSE can be used in the lateral
movement phase of a targeted attack. It can be deployed to control a Linux server in the
victim’s network. It can also find other vulnerable Linux units which it can infect to sustain the
attack further.
While half of the threat of UNIX BIFROSE falls on its capabilities, the other half falls on
Shrouded Crossbow’s capability to create tools such as updated versions of BIFROSE.
As far as which platform BIFROSE will move to next, it will not be a matter of time. Instead, it
will be a matter of need. If Shrouded Crossbow needs BIFROSE for iOS or Android, it is
possible, even if they have to rewrite the code. And looking at how they were able to create
UNIX BIFROSE, an OS X version may not be far off.
Implications on Enterprises
Upon the first signs of abnormal activities, such as those seen through network and mail
logs, IT admins must be prepared and quick to respond. As we’ve mentioned in our past
post, 7 Places to Check for Signs of a Targeted Attack in Your Network, network activities
such as logins and emails during “abnormal” times need to be checked.

3/4

When enterprises face targeted attacks, they have to apply the same attention and focus on
their own network to detect intrusions and anomalies and respond appropriately. Network
defense platforms like Trend Micro Deep Discovery, Deep Security, and
ServerProtect enable IT admins to detect, analyze and respond to these kinds of threats.
They can detect BIFROSE behaviors such as malicious behavior, command-and-control
communications, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
