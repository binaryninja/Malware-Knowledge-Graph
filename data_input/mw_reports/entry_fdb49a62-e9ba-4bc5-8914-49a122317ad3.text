In a series of malspam campaigns dating back to November of 2019, an unidentiﬁed group sent
out waves of installers that drop remote administration tool (RAT) and information stealing
malware on victims’ computers.
We’ve identiﬁed ﬁve separate campaigns between November, 2019 and January, 2020 in which
the payloads used similar packing code and pointed to the same command and control (C&C)
infrastructure. The campaigns targeted industrial companies in Europe, the Middle East, and the
Republic of Korea. This leads us to believe that they are all the work of the same actors—a group
we’ve dubbed RATicate.
A new campaign we believe connected to the same actors leverages concern about the global
COVID-19 pandemic to convince victims to open the payloads. This is a shift in tactics, but we
suspect that this group constantly changes the way they deploy malware—and that the group has
conducted campaigns prior to this past November.
In this post, we’ll focus on the initial wave of campaigns, which all used Nullsoft Scriptable Install
System (NSIS) installers. NSIS is an open source tool for creating Windows installers, designed
for Internet-based software distribution. But it has also been abused for a long time to disguise
and deploy malware. (We’ll discuss newer campaigns using other installers, and the group’s shift
in phishing tactics, in an upcoming follow-up report.)

One of the interesting features of NSIS installers is their plug-in architecture, which allow
installers to communicate with other software components—including components of the
Windows operating system. (A list of available plug-ins can be found here.) These plug-ins are
deployed as Windows DLL ﬁles. If selected during the installer build, they will be automatically
added to the ﬁnal compiled NSIS installer’s packaged ﬁles inside the “$PLUGINS” folder.
Some of the capabilities these plugins can provide include:
The installers we looked at caught our attention because they all drop the same set of “junk ﬁles”
(ﬁles that are never used by the installed malware) across the initial sample set. We’ve seen the
tactic of packing NSIS installers with garbage ﬁles to conceal malware in the past; the junk ﬁles
are intended to confuse analysts and create “noise” during sandbox analysis. So this behavior
caught our attention, and we started to analyze it in more detail.
We found that all the samples use the System.dll plugin, which allows you to load a DLL and call
its exported functions. The DLL called by these malicious installers injects a payload into memory
(in most cases by using cmd.exe).
For purposes of illustration, this report focuses primarily on the analysis of one sample NSIS
installer from the ﬁrst group we discovered:

The output of the Exeinfo PE tool identiﬁes the sample as an NSIS installer

NSIS installers contain compressed components, including executable code, which can be loaded
into memory by the installers. These components can be extracted using ﬁle decompression
tools, such as 7zip.

The installer drops the junk ﬁles into the %TEMP%/careers/katalog/_mem_bin/page1/W3SVC2
folder.

Junk ﬁles created by analyzed sample.

There are only two components dropped by the installer that are important to the malware
installation, which are dropped into the $TEMP folder. In the case of the NSIS installer we
analyzed for this report, these two components are:
aventailes.dll (the Initial Loader)
Cluck (Encrypted data)
The payloads of the installers we examined vary. During analysis of the samples we collected—
conducted both manually and with the aid of sandboxing tools—we found several different
families of RATs and infostealers. These included Lokibot, Betabot, Formbook, and AgentTesla.
But all of them followed the same multi-stage unpacking process when executed.

First stage: initial loader and shellcode
In the ﬁrst stage, the installer deploys the initial loader, a malicious DLL. The DLL is then used to
begin decryption of the malicious payload, and then ﬁnally to inject malicious payload into
memory while the NSIS layer drops the junk ﬁles. The following images show how the analyzed
sample creates a cmd.exe process, which is used to inject the Final Payload.

Output of Procmon which shows how the analyzed sample
creates a child process

The memory of created child process by the analyzed sample. The ﬁnal
payload is loaded at the address 0x400000.

The malicious DLL deployed with the RATicate installers (in this case, aventailes.dll) is a custom
loader, likely developed by the threat actor, stored in the $TEMP folder of the ﬁle package. All of
the analyzed initial loaders are DLL ﬁles with only one export, though the name of the loader and
the export function vary across the samples. In this case, the export was named Inquilinity.
This export is called using the NSIS System plugin as explained previously. The export loads and
executes a shellcode, located in the initial loader’s .rdata section. The shellcode is initially
encrypted using a basic arithmetic operation. This operation varies across the initial loaders we
analyzed.
The shellcode dropped by the initial loader then reads the Encrypted data (Cluck ﬁle) where other
loaders and payloads are stored. These PE ﬁles and shellcodes are decrypted on demand during
the next two stages of malware deployment. In the ﬁrst stage of the decryption, done by the
shellcode called by initial loader, contains an xor key, a second shellcode (shellcode 2), and a PE
ﬁle (Loader 2).

Export of Initial Loader

The xor key is used to decrypt shellcode2 and Loader 2.
Here’s how the workﬂow of Stage 1 breaks down in depth:

Stage 1 workﬂow:
1. NSIS exe ﬁle is executed.
2. System.dll plugin loads and calls to Initial Loader (aventailes.dll)
3. The export of Initial Loader decrypts shellcode1 and jumps to it.
4. shellcode1 reads Cluck ﬁle which is loaded in a memory buffer.
5. shellcode1 decrypts both shellcode2 and Loader2 and maps shellcode2 then jumps to it.
6. shellcode2 maps Loader2 into memory (Reﬂective loading).

Second stage: second shellcode and loader DLL
The second stage of decryption begins when Loader 2 is loaded in memory by
shellcode2. Loader 2 reads the Cluck ﬁle in order to decrypt more artifacts. The data for this stage
is decrypted with a dynamically generated xor key based on the name of the ﬁle which contains
the encrypted data (which in this case is Cluck). As shown below, after this xor is applied, there is
another xor key (xor_key2) stored in the second part of the ﬁle, which is used to decrypt different
artifacts like strings, shellcodes, and PE ﬁles.

1. Loader2 starts executing its DllEntryPoint.
2. Loader2 reads again Cluck ﬁle.
3. Loader2 decrypts from Cluck some shellcodes which are never used.
4. Loader2 decrypts shellcode3 from read data from Cluck.
5. Loader2 executes shellcode3, which decrypts the Final Payload (a PE ﬁle).

Third stage: injection
After the decryption, shellcode3 injects the ﬁnal payload in a child process. It accomplishes this
using cmd.exe with the NtCreateSection + NtMapViewOfSection code injection technique.
These are the extracted artifacts during the analysis.

Hints of a single actor
We found 38 NSIS installer samples in total that shared very similar characteristics:
Identical junk ﬁles. Not only their name, but also their content. When generating the installer from
NSIS Script, the actor who is packing the payload would have to have all these random ﬁles in
their possession on their hard drive.
The loader is the same: All the loaders across analyzed NSIS installers are the same, not in
terms of their hash value but in terms of their functionality.
All initial loaders have just one export, which is called by the NSIS installer
The Initial Loader reads from Encrypted Data in order to decrypt a shellcode which loads
the Loader 2.
Loader 2 across all samples extracts and decrypts shellcode 3 from Encrypted Data.
Shellcode 3, responsible for decrypting the ﬁnal payload and injecting it into a remote
process, is binary-equal between all analyzed samples.
However, each NSIS installer we looked at dropped different malware payloads. We considered
two possible scenarios: either the malicious NSIS package is a generic packer sold on dark
forums; or, the same threat actor is using a custom loader to deploy different payloads in a variety
of their attacks.
While there are many packers sold in dark forums, we found this scenario unlikely, as one should
expect the junk ﬁles to change along with the payloads, if different actors were using the same
generic packer. So, we continued our investigation with the hypothesis the attacks come from the
same actor.

Given the evidence we have in hand, we can’t prove that a single actor was responsible for all of
them, but we at least knew from the identical packing strategy and artifacts that we could ﬁnd a
way to connect all of them. We performed further analysis in search of a deﬁnitive link, turning to
the infection chain that delivered them.
Based on Sophos telemetry, we found a set of NSIS installers dropping these same junk ﬁles as
part of an email campaign seen between December 8 and December 13, 2019. (We later
designated this wave Campaign 3, after discovering other sets of NSIS installers, discussed
later.) In the email attacks we observed, the targets appeared to all be critical infrastructure
providers (or businesses related to critical infrastructure). We analyzed the observed attacks
using VirusTotal’s graphing feature, gathering open-source information about other victims.

The graph above shows the infection chain for some of the analyzed NSIS installers. It reveals
two common patterns used to infect a victim:

Superimposing the distinct infection chains over the graph shows that both chains were used for
the same target company revealed by VT data. It is likely the same approach is taken for any
targeted company.

One of the Campaign 3 emails, presenting the installer as a “banking conﬁrmation.”

Many of the the emails we found in VirusTotal data did not show recipients’ addresses, or the “To”
address was ﬁlled with the same email address that appeared in the “From” ﬁeld. In these cases,
we analyzed the email headers—since the headers hold more information related to the email,
like the original recipients.

During the analysis of the NSIS installers we found with identical junk ﬁles to our initial sample,
we identiﬁed at least 5 different malware families used as ﬁnal payload—all of them InfoStealer or
RAT malware:
ForeIT/Lokibot
BetaBot
Formbook
AgentTesla
Netwire

We then looked at the Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure used for these payloads, to
check for any relationship between them and to see if the C&Cs were used to send the stolen
data points to same or similar servers.
These are some of the families identiﬁed in this campaign and their C&Cs:

Almost all of the malware samples of each type connected to the campaign share the same C&C.
And in some cases, even different families—such as Lokibot and Betabot—share same domain
for their C&C.

Identifying more campaigns
Following this pattern—looking for other groups of NSIS installers which drop identical junk ﬁles
during the same range of dates—we were able to identify 5 distinct NSIS campaigns that took
place between November 16, 2019 and January 8, 2020. While the junk ﬁles for each of these
campaigns were different from our ﬁrst samples, their behavior was identical (or at least similar)
to those observed in Campaign 3.

We also found that some of the different payloads from each campaign (mostly Betabot, Lokibot,
AgentTesla and Formbook) shared the same C&C. This suggests that the same actor/group was
managing the web panels behind these malware campaigns.
There was also a distinct clustering of the campaign timelines—there was never any overlap
between them, suggesting that they were operated serially by the same threat actors (including a
sixth campaign we observed, to be covered in our next report):

These campaigns didn’t just share command and control infrastructure across different payloads
within the same campaign. Some of the infrastructure was also shared across multiple
campaigns, which also suggests the same actor was involved across all of them.
The following tables show some interesting relations between campaigns.

Targeting and motivation
Based on the payloads used by RATicate, it’s clear that the campaigns run by the group are
intended to gain access to and control of computers on the targeted companies’ networks. The
targets identiﬁed from the collected emails sent by these campaigns include:

RATicate: an attacker’s waves of information-stealing malware – Sophos News

An electrical equipment manufacturer in Romania;
A Kuwaiti construction services and engineering company;
A Korean internet company;
A Korean investment ﬁrm;
A British building supply manufacturer;
A Korean medical news publication;
A Korean telecommunications and electrical cable manufacturer;
A Swiss publishing equipment manufacturer;
A Japanese courier and transportation company.
We know that the targets overlapped on at least two campaigns: Campaign 1 and 2 both targeted
the electrical equipment manufacturer. There are likely more targets that were common across
multiple campaigns (we looked only at publicly-available data from VirusTotal, and have not
explored non-public databases). And many (but not all) of the companies that have been
targeted-up are related to critical infrastructure.
We’ve detected one more recent campaign using these NSIS installers (from January 13-16).
However, as we’ve continued to research this actor group, we’ve been studying other campaigns
that we believe are being run by the the same actor—and we believe that since January, the actor
has moved to using other loaders and packers.
One of those campaigns is an email campaign we detected in March that uses the COVID-19
global pandemic as a lure to get victims to open the payload. The most recent detected samples
are delivered with a variety of Visual Basic loaders —including the Guloader malware dropper
discovered by Proofpoint on December 2019.
We believe these campaigns are run by the same actor fro a number of reasons:
The email targets the same companies seen in previous campaigns.
Some of the detected payloads are Betabot and Lokibot, families observed in previous
campaigns.
This Betabot’s C&C are similar to observed in these previous campaigns—it uses same
domain as Campaign 3 for Betabot (stngpetty[.]ga) and uses a similar path
(/~zadmin/{NAME1}/{NAME2}/logout.php).

Based on their behavior, we’re unsure of whether the RATicate group is focused on corporate
espionage or is simply acting as a malware-as-a-service provider to other actors. It could simply

be that they are dropping malware on targeted companies in order to provide paid access to
others, or are using InfoStealer and RAT malware as part of a larger malware distribution effort.
We continue to analyze the new attacks and hope to get deeper insight into their motivations.

Anti-sandboxing by dumb luck
During our analysis of the ﬁrst RATicate sample, we discovered that the Shellcode3 dropped by
the installer uses a number of interesting techniques to make it difﬁcult to analyze API calls, as
well as a number of anti-debugging tricks to further hinder analysis. But we also found a strange
behavior in these samples: if the sample is executed with its SHA256 hash as its ﬁlename, the
program will crash.

Analyzed sample crashing when the ﬁle name size is its SHA256 hash.

This sort of behavior might be seen as an anti-analysis trick. Since sandboxes usually run the
samples with their hash as a ﬁlename, this technique could avoid the execution of the payload in
sandbox environments. But in this case, the behavior is actually because of a bug in the code.
The error occurs during the execution of shellcode 3.

A snippet of shellcode 3’s code as viewed in IDA Pro.

Shellcode3 uses a known technique to get the address of loaded modules (such as libraries and
the executable’s image itself) by searching against the LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY data
structure within the Windows operating system’s Process Environment Block (PEB). The LDR

structure contains information that includes the names and addresses of loaded modules. The
shell code checks this structure against hashes of the desired function names, providing a silent
way to dynamically resolve the memory address of a function to be called.

Shellcode 3 function to get module base addresses based on LDR_DATA_TABLE, which contains a bug that
causes the sample to crash.

This feature is implemented in the code’s get_dll_base_addres_from_ldr_by_hash(dll_hash)
function, which is where the crash happens. The function walks through the LDR data structure,
hashing the names of loaded modules in order to try to match the hash passed as argument.
The function puts the contents of ldr_data_table->BaseDllName.Buffer into vulnerable_buffer in
order to convert the ANSI string to a UNICODE string.
But since the size of the vulnerable_buffer string is 104 and it’s storing a Unicode string, which
means its size limit is really just 52 ANSI characters. The consequences of that are if the ﬁlename
has a length of 53 or more characters, a buffer overﬂow will occur. To make the program crash,
you simply need to give the sample a 57-character-long ﬁlename (such as
“this_is_57_length_ﬁlename_in_order_to_do_a_crash_PoC.exe”).
Once analyzed, we determined this was a programming error, rather than an anti-sandbox
technique.
