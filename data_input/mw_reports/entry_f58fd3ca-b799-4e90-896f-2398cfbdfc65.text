Contents
Introduction
At the end of September 2020, Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT Expert Security Center, PT ESC) was involved in the investigation of an incident in one of the largest pharmaceutical
companies. After starting to analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the attackers, the investigation team found similarities with the Lazarus Group attacks previously described in
detail by cybersecurity experts in the reports Operation: Dream Job and "Operation (노스 스타) North Star A Job Offer That's Too Good to be True?".
This article describes a previously unknown attack by the APT group, reveals the Lazarus Group's TTPs that allowed attackers to obtain partial control over a pharmaceutical company's infrastructure in
just four days, as well as the tools used by the attackers for preliminary compromise, network reconnaissance, and gaining persistence in the infrastructure of the targeted company.
At the end of the article, PT ESC provides a list of the group's TTPs and indicators of compromise that can be used by cybersecurity specialists to identify traces of the group's attacks and search for
threats in their infrastructure.

1. Sequence of events
At the end of September 2020, an employee of the pharmaceutical company received a document named GD2020090939393903.doc with a job offer (creation date: 2020:09:22 03:08:00). After a
short period of time, another employee received a document named GD20200909GAB31.doc with a job offer from the same company (creation date: 2020:09:14 07:50:00). By opening the documents
from a potential employer, both victims activated malicious macros on their home computers (see the «Malicious document» section).

Figure 1. Malicious document

In one of the cases, a malicious document was received via Telegram. Note that both documents were received by the victims over the weekend.
After running malicious macros on two compromised computers, reconnaissance was performed (T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery) by using system utilities ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and
net.exe. Also the following unknown PE files were launched:
C:\ProgramData\Applications\ZCacher.dat ;
C:\ProgramData\Applications\MemoryCompressor.tls-lbn ;
C:\ProgramData\Applications\MemoryCompressor.tls ;
C:\ProgramData\Applications\MemoryCompressor64.exe .
It was not possible to gain full access to all the files listed above during the incident investigation.
One of the compromised computers used CommsCacher, a backdoor named ApplicationCacher-f0182c1a4.rb (compilation date: 2020-09-14T16:21:41Z), and its configuration file
C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\.IdentityService\AccountStore.bak encrypted with the VEST algorithm, as well as the LNK startup file C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\MSSqlite3Svc.lnk. Notably, the backdoor monitors RDP sessions on the compromised computer using WTSEnumerateSessionsW (see the Trojan-Backdoor
CommsCacher section).
According to the proxy server logs, the compromised computers tried to connect to the address forecareer[.]com:443, which was not detected by antivirus engines as malicious at the time of the
attack. According to WHOIS entries, the domain had been registered a few days before the attack began.

Figure 3. Domain registrar data

At the time of the attack, content was published on the domain that copied a page of the official website of General Dynamics Mission Systems, one of the world's largest manufacturers of military and
aerospace equipment. The Lazarus Group had already used this brand in its attacks. The domain also had a valid SSL certificate.

At the beginning of the working week, both victims connected to the RDG server of one of the organization's branches from the compromised personal computers. This allowed attackers to gain access
to the company's corporate network.
On the same day, the company's RDG server showed traces of illegitimate activity and evidence of malicious reconnaissance on the network for the first time. The compromised accounts, in particular,
were used to run system utilities systeminfo.exe, ipconfig.exe, netstat.exe, tasklist.exe, qwinsta.exe, query.exe, quser.exe, net.exe, and ping.exe, as well as C:\ProgramData\Comms\Cacher.hls-iol
(version of the public utility ADFind for Active Directory requests).

Later, CommsCacher with the name C:\ProgramData\USOShared\usomsqlite3.lgs.dat was also installed on the RDG server.
The attackers also uploaded an unknown PE file with the name C:\ProgramData\volitile.dat and launched the DLL library C:\ProgramData\comms\commspkg.bin (compilation date: 2020-0822T18:45:25Z), which executes files transfered in the configuration via the command line using CreateProcessW. The library is protected by VMProtect.

cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe c:\\programdata\\comms\\commspkg.bin,Serialize +JHzz8nMxMn+wvv+y/7z+MzCwsjz+MzCwsjPwMSN+/7L"

Two days later, after entering the corporate network, the attackers gained access to a number of servers, including the domain controller, additional RDG server, file server, and Crontab server. On
these servers, the attackers also performed reconnaissance using system utilities and system services with the name usomgmt. The attackers used this name to name their own services on the
compromised hosts:
cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.dat -f C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.out C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.bin 1q2w3e4r@#$@#$@#$

cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.dat 312 C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.bat

cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net user admin$ abcd1234!@#$ /add

cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net localgroup administrators admin$ /add

cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net localgroup -?-¦-+-+-+-+-?-?-?-¦-?-+-?-? admin$ /add

cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net user admin$ /delete >> C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.out

During incident investigation, the experts failed to gain access to files C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.dat, C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.out, C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.bin, and
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\gpolicy.bat. Tampering with creation, deletion, and addition of the user admin$ to the administrator group would later provoke the suspicion of the system administrators
of the compromised company and serve as the beginning of the incident response.
Similar actions of attackers with the account admin$ were described in the report "Greetings from Lazarus."

At the same time, by performing reconnaissance on the computers available, the attackers received new vectors for penetration into the company's corporate network. So, two days later, after the
company's network infrastructure was compromised, another employee from another branch received a job offer. On the social network LinkedIn, the victim was contacted by a user named Rob
Wilson, shortly after which she received an email with a job offer from General Dynamics UK.

Figure 8. Rob Wilson account

After studying the information about the job and the company through the Yandex search engine, Wikipedia and the legitimate website of General Dynamics UK, the employee continued to correspond
with Rob Wilson's account, from whom they received links to download malicious documents GD20200909GAB31.doc, PDF20200920KLKA.pdf, and PDF20200920KLKA.zip from an attackercontrolled job search website clicktocareers[.]com, which was not detected by antivirus engines as malicious at the time of the attack.

Note that the victim failed to open the received PDF document the first time, after which the attackers sent her the InternalPDFViewer.exe software to view PDF files.

Sensitive information has been replaced with asterisks (*).
On the compromised computer, the attackers performed reconnaissance using system commands query.exe, quser.exe, and netstat.exe and installed a CommsCacher backdoor named
CommsCacher.dat, which gains persistence via an LNK file in the startup folder. The experts also discovered the evidence of launching the malicious DLL Trojan-Downloader Agamemnon regid.mdb
(compilation date: 2020-09-14T16:21:26Z), which is extracted from a malicious document, then collects information from the infected host, sends it to the attackers' server, and in response receives a
payload (see the Trojan-Downloader Agamemnon section). Command execution and network reconnaissance on the computer were carried out using the public utility SMBMAP designed for scanning
SMB services.

3. Trojan-Downloader Agamemnon
If successful, the malicious macro extracts the decrypted data to the file 963e8cfaa40226ba2e5d516464572446 in the directory C:\ProgramData\regid.mdb and runs the library with the following
parameters:
rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\regid.mdb,sqlite3_create_functionex X4BJOPK3O6nxwkVuK3HqqTt4 LRTB
/QV3AcjAeAb/x3xH+0ZhyOBJfZXilGFS69N5E/rSe2z47XDp8uh37v2vZ6/zrkkg9KFobffsQyr5q0Urx6pxtP31eXHG8ER2xfd/t8/2SjjQeXOF8oR6guvDbIPownS85T1uOfD4YX7tv2T/4D5iMOnxaj3pfFW607td+9P6bGTTJVah2OBeptWn
YFRm7+dYZ9imQGjcKV313vRd8svzW/Pfsl8Mxc1QCd1IV87Xz1CPxg5TAOqBWg3XzFdKw==

Agamemnon is a legitimate SQLite DLL library with the malicious exported function sqlite3_create_functionex. This modification as well as the method of gaining persistence on a compromised
computer in the startup folder were described in the report Operation (노스 스타) North Star A Job Offer That's Too Good to be True.

When launched, the extracted file regid.mdb collects the following information about the system:
Computer name;
Information about network adapters;
User name;
List of running processes.
Next, the malware compresses the received data using the LZ algorithm with the maximum compression ratio, after which it encrypts the data with its own algorithm and encodes it in Base64. The
malware also generates a unique identifier for the infected host.
The collected information is sent to one of the attackers' C2 servers along with the computer ID. The full list of C2 servers is transmitted in encrypted form via the command line. The file
GD2020090939393903.doc transmits the following list of C2 servers:
https://propro[.]jp/wp-content/documents/docsmgmt.php
http://www.ctevt.org[.]np/ctevt/public/frontend/review.php
http://gbflatinamerica[.]com/file/filelist.php

http://goldllama4.sakura.ne[.]jp/waterdo/wp/wp-content/plugins/view.php
https://bootcamp-coders.cnm[.]edu/~dmcdonald21/emoji-review/storage/app/humor.php

After sending the data to the C2 server, the malware receives a response from it. It contains the main payload also encrypted with its own algorithm. It is either executed in the process memory or
uploaded to the hard disk at: %localappdata%\~DMF[0-9]{4}.tmp (the path is given in RegExp format) and launched using rundll32.exe. The version of payload execution is determined by the
response of the C2 server.
Note that the loader is successfully detected in the public sandbox ANY.RUN.

4. Trojan-Backdoor CommsCacher
CommsCacher is also a legitimate SQLite DLL library with the malicious exported function sqlite3_create_functionex. Examples of LNK files with CommsCacher autorun parameters are shown
below.

CommsCacher downloads and uploads configuration data to the hard disk in the file: %localappdata%\.IdentityService\AccountStore.bak. The configuration file is encrypted with the VEST encryption
algorithm and contains a list of C2 servers. Example of the configuration data:
https://akramportal[.]org/delv/public/voice/voice.php
https://vega.mh-tec[.]jp/.well-known/gallery/siteview.php
https://www.hospitality-partners[.]co.jp/works/performance/consumer.php
https://inovecommerce[.]com.br/public/pdf/view.php

Connecting to one of the C2 servers, the sample receives shellcode and configuration data in response from the C2. The received data is decrypted and the shellcode with the transmitted parameters is
launched. After that, the CommsCacher malware opens a named pipe \\.\pipe\fb4d1181bb09b484d058768598b, which is used to receive data from the shellcode and then transmit it to the C2
server.
The detected samples C:\ProgramData\Applications\ApplicationCacher-f0182c1a4.rbs (compilation date: 2020-09-24T05:12:24Z) and C:\ProgramData\USOShared\usomsqlite3.lgs.dat (compilation
date: 2020-09-29T03:34:06Z) are similar to CommsCacher. The files contain 64 MB of random repeating characters. They could be used by the attackers to bypass antivirus protection that can ignore
large files.
The backdoor functions and its server side were described in detail in the article Operation North Star: Behind The Scenes.

5. Logs of victims
During the incident investigation, a number of malicious C2 servers were identified, and, after studying them, the experts managed to obtain log files with the IP addresses of victims also compromised
by this group. Log format: [JD = ID][Date] [Victim IP] [User-Agent].
All identified victims were notified of the incidents. Sensitive information has been replaced with asterisks (*).

Figure 15. Example of lines from a victim log

The attacker-controlled servers contained files named sclient+[md5 victim]+.tmp or pagefile+[md5 victim]+.dat. These files contained information from compromised computers.

6. Attribution
The detected indicators of compromise belong to Lazarus Group, a hacker group also known as Hidden Cobra. The group has been operating since 2009 at least. Lazarus is thought to belong to a class
of government-sponsored APT groups and come from North Korea. The group regularly conducts its attacks for the purpose of cyberespionage.
The main source vector of attacks is targeted phishing through third-party resources (Phishing: Spearphishing via Service). In this campaign, attackers, under the guise of the HR service of General
Dynamics Mission Systems, sent documents with malicious macros containing a stub text with a job offer through LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
Below is an example of correspondence between one of the victims and an attacker in the Telegram messenger. In this case, the attacker offered the victim to do a test assignment on the attackercontrolled server.

Figure 16. Example of correspondence with the attacker

To attack the organization, the attackers created a phishing site of General Dynamics Mission Systems. As C2 servers, they used the resources of allegedly compromised organizations located in Brazil,
France, Japan, South Korea, and the United States.

Figure 17. Original and fake version of the GDMS website

The group is characterized by the use of unique malicious software for remote command execution:
The detected backdoor CommsCacher indicates a connection with the malicious company Dream Job and identifies the group of attackers as the Lazarus Group.
The document GD2020090939393903.doc obtained during the investigation contains a malicious macro, an encrypted payload, and startup parameters that are stored in Text Box shapes, which
coincides with the description of malicious documents that were described in the McAfee report.
The malicious campaign was also reported by researchers from IssueMakersLab:

7. Conclusions
To identify all compromised hosts and obtain detailed information about the incident, the experts scanned the entire company's infrastructure for indicators of compromise, as well as network and file
signatures of users. All possible host artifacts were also analyzed. The most useful artifacts for restoring the incident chronology were the USN Journal, EVTX Events, Jump Lists, and the MFT table.
This article describes the TTPs of the Lazarus Group, which allowed them to gain partial control over the infrastructure of the compromised company within four days. This shows a high degree of
preparedness of attackers and an individual approach to compromising each host on the infrastructure. The attackers used both publicly available software and tools of their own design.
According to the investigation, the attackers did not gain access to sensitive information. As a result of the prompt actions of PT ESC specialists and administrators of the pharmaceutical company, the
attackers were deprived of access to the controlled infrastructure.

The article's author thanks the incident response and threat intelligence teams PT Expert Security Center for their help in drafting the story.

8. Similar malicious campaign
After investigating the incident, we continued to track the Lazarus Group and identified a new attack that has no direct connection to the case in question, but affects a similar geographical segment.
During this attack, in November 2020, attackers used a malicious document (GDLS47129481.docx 994c02f8c721254a959ed9bc823ab94b) with CVE-2017-0199. The attack was allegedly aimed at a
company from Russia. The attack was also reported on the Anonymous Security Agency's Twitter account.
The document contained the following stub:
