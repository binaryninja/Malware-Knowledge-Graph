Introduction
Few topics in the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) prompt as much passion and debate as the concept of
threat attribution. From numerous conference talks, to blogs and papers, to various applications in CTI analysis,
the question of threat attribution repeatedly emerges. While CTI attribution discussions can take many forms
and aim at specific audiences—for example, policy-makers and state strategy1—this discussion will focus on the
technical analyst’s perspective. In adopting this viewpoint, the question of attribution typically manifests in a very
binary fashion.2 Whereas attribution, as described below, represents various gradations, most discussion limits
itself to “yes or no” discussions as to the value and need for CTI attribution, when the actual answer (as with most
things in CTI) is, “it depends.”
In this paper, a concept of attribution that moves the CTI community away from binary conceptions of CTI
attribution value and instead approaches a continuum of attribution types will be introduced. In doing so, multiple
possibilities emerge for CTI attributive statements, of different values and significance for different parties—as

well as different degrees of relevance for those who wish to make such statements. Through this discussion, the
relative value of different types of statements will be examined. Additionally, critical consideration will be applied
to why some positions along the emerging continuum of attribution types may be less than desirable for all
parties, and ultimately best avoided.

Defining an Attribution Continuum
At present, no shortage exists of discussions on CTI attribution. From brief, general media overviews to multiple
in-depth academic works to vendor-specific methodology discussions,3 various perspectives exist on the subject
of how and why to perform CTI attribution.4 Yet common to nearly all these approaches is a focus on a binary
perspective with respect to the value of attribution: whether such activity is desirable, or should be ignored. This
view results in a false dichotomy of either an “all in” approach of threat actor attribution or ignoring the subject as
either not useful for defenders, or not possible for most CTI analysts.
Resulting debates differentiate between attribution as a way of identifying perpetrators and actors responsible
for given cyber operations, and more behavior-centric clustering of identified activity to delineate sets of
common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This separation of behavioral clustering from “attribution” is
reflected in academic literature, where attribution is frequently defined in the following, “who-centric” manner:
“[A]ttribution” [is] “determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s
intermediary.” A resulting identity may be a person’s name, an account, an alias, or similar
information associated with a person. A location may include physical (geographic) location, or
a virtual location such as an IP address or Ethernet address.5
This view of attribution—focusing on the definition of a specific organization or even person behind operations as
well as characteristics of that organization—seems far too narrow to reflect operational realities for the overall
concept. If we instead adopt a perspective where “attribution” represents the identification or classification of an
incident to a given entity where entity is a flexible identifier ranging from “how-centric” attribution, linking
observations to clusters of similar behaviors or TTPs, to very specific “who-focused” attribution, referencing a
specific person or organization, multiple possibilities emerge. In adopting this view, analysts approach a range of
attribution options which can be mapped to a continuum, such as the following representation:

In this view, CTI attribution does not become a question of “yes or no” but rather “how and to what degree.” All
organizations, analysts, and CTI vendors therefore perform attribution, but do so to different degrees as outlined
in the above continuum of options. By exploring the “poles” of this continuum—Behavioral Attribution on the far
left, and Primary Attribution on the far right—we can gain greater insights into the attribution process and its
implications.

Behavioral Attribution
The left pole of the attribution continuum focuses primarily on technical observables and evidence. Related items
include malware samples, network infrastructure, logs and system artifacts, and similar observations. Residing
within technical observations and observed activities, this type of attribution centers on how a given event took
place while abstracting away from who might be responsible. Network defenders as well as CTI vendors and
analysts will typically reside primarily in this realm, as the majority of (if not all) available evidence relating to
cyber operations typically resides in this region.

Clustering related activity based on technical observations, behaviors, or TTPs represents a fundamental element
of cybersecurity, and is applied by multiple vendors and analysts when generating intelligence products. Central
to the concept is remaining faithful to the evidence on hand, and not projecting further than available information
allows. In this fashion, Behavioral Attribution—though still quite complex and often difficult to execute in
practice—remains both grounded in existing observations while remaining accessible to a variety of parties.

Typical names for Behavioral Attribution include activity groups, behavioral clusters, and similar nomenclature.6
Importantly, the resulting names and “designators” assigned to the resulting clusters are representative of an
analytical methodology—how the observations were clustered—as opposed to any inherent attribute of the
responsible party. Thus the names and cryptonyms used by vendors and analysts in Behavioral Attribution are
meaningful primarily in the sense of acting as placeholders.7 An APT number or adjective describing a behavioral
cluster simply reflects the collection of evidence and the methodology used to link observations, rather than
adhering to the specific entity or party responsible for creating the observations in the first place.
Overall Behavioral Attribution seeks to bucket and group observations as they are linked through technical
analysis or observation within technical artifacts. As such, this type of attribution can be quite powerful in
grouping similar activities while respecting the boundaries of available evidence. However, such an approach also
will, by definition, fail to generate any understanding as to the identity or motivations of the party responsible for
a given operation. Certainly there is some scope to infer intentionality—for example, the presence of code
designed to delete data, as in Shamoon, or a “ransomware” routine that does not allow for decryption, as seen in
NotPetya, gives insight into adversary intent8—but further links to purpose, desire, and motivation require
inferences that are difficult to defend absent significant non-technical evidence.

Primary Attribution
The right pole of the attribution continuum incorporates significant non-technical data to flesh out information
about the perpetrators of a given cyber incident as opposed to details and aspects of the incident itself. Unlike
Behavioral Attribution, this “who-centric” approach to attribution extends beyond technical observables to
incorporate evidence relating to or describing the entity responsible.

Primary Attribution delves to the source of activity, rather than just
its externally observable features. As such, Primary Attribution
seeks to determine precisely who is responsible for a given event,
potentially down to the identity of specific persons. The information
required to make such assessments is difficult to gather, and in
many cases not available to private parties. Occasionally CTI
vendors are able to gather information allowing for Primary
Attribution statements, such as Mandiant’s seminal APT1 report
linking the identified activity to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
Unit 61398.9 Other entities, such as Citizen Lab based at the
University of Toronto or the Bellingcat organization, may also
occasionally reach supportable Primary Attribution conclusions
with respect to cyber activity. More often, the required information
to link activity to specific organizations or persons resides in
capabilities reserved for government use: law enforcement
authorities such as warrants or subpoenas; lawful interception of
communications; or Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) collection and analysis
conducted by intelligence agencies.
Central to these capabilities is the ability to move from technical observation to identification of a persona
responsible for that activity. To satisfy the evidentiary needs of Primary Attribution, investigations must move
into “who-focused” avenues where private entities not only are ill equipped to operate, but often are prohibited
from doing so by law. As a result, independent researchers and analysts often get the best glimpses of Primary
Attribution statements through public releases by government entities in the form of indictments, sanctions, or
similar actions specifying parties related to a given cyber operation. By correlating technical observations to the
publicly documented incident, CTI analysts can perform transitive attribution through this available evidence to
get close to Primary Attribution statements.
While Behavioral Attribution remains foremost in importance for frontline defenders, in that such an approach
focuses on the actual how behind or shaping operations, Primary Attribution, when done well and properly, has
significant benefits as well. When correctly performed with proper evidence, Primary Attribution can link events
to specific groups or personas which allows for reasonable estimation of intention or purpose. When combined
with technical observations, such visibility can be very powerful in enabling defender response. Yet given the
evidentiary requirements of Primary Attribution, typically such information (and more importantly, finalized
analysis) is not available until well after events have transpired, making this approach valuable but typically not
applicable to operational network defense.

(https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf)

General Attribution
Finally, while significant “left-” and “right-tail” space exists adjacent to the poles of Behavioral and Primary
Attribution—where either some evidence exists to migrate slightly beyond behaviors, or not enough allows for
definitive assignment to a specific group—a middle ground is also present. In this case, analysts move beyond pure
technical observations, but lack the evidence necessary to link activity to a specific group, person, or related
entity.
This middle ground typically represents the most accessible degree of “who-centric” attribution for most analysts
and vendors. Yet its value is questionable, along with the possibility of allowing for assumptions and bias to leak
into analysis. The easiest way to conceptualize this type of attribution, General Attribution, is through statements
such as “this incident is linked to China” or “this event is tied to ransomware operators working out of Romania” or
similar generic statements.

In addition to approaches where limited evidence or projections of intent allow migration from Behavioral
Attribution toward General Attribution, it is also possible for attributive statements to degrade over time from
Primary Attribution. In this scenario, an analyst encounters external evidence (an indictment, sanctions, or similar
primary source evidence) enabling Primary Attribution statements related to specific activity. But, as illustrated
in the above diagram, such statements are valid only for the activity covered by the given evidence and its
circumstances. Subsequently, such evidence decays toward General Attribution statements where we can link
subsequent activity to historical incidents tied to a specific party, but such links are no longer as firm as they were
initially.
General Attribution claims identify a geographic region and potentially general interest, but fail to move beyond
such statements to precise identification of responsible parties or motivations. While these may seem as on their
face useful in providing rough guidance to what entity may be responsible for a given operation, such an approach
carries significant and worrisome assumptions. Most importantly, this approach assumes that entities such as
“China” or “Romanian criminal elements” are unitary actors with similar (if not identical) motivations and goals,

when all available evidence indicates significant diversity among such higher-level groupings of cyber operators.
Just as a continuum exists reflecting degrees of attribution, we can also view state-directed cyber operations as
residing along a continuum of motivations and degrees of responsibility.10 General Attribution to a diverse entity,
such as a country, may generate headlines or a sense of satisfaction, but does little to further either tactical or
even strategic planning against a given adversary.
Essentially, General Attribution represents a minimally-enriched “best guess” half-way mark toward more robust
“who-based” Primary Attribution. Such statements may be supportable and defensible given evidence (e.g.,
activity identified is ultimately linked to a given state), but the utility of doing so is debatable while the scope for
misinterpretation or assumption is concerningly high. While General Attribution statements are accessible to
most analysts and organizations, their value, as will be demonstrated in greater detail below, is questionable for
all parties with an interest in CTI attributive statements.

Attribution Action Constraints
Attributive actions, although representing some degree of choice on the analyst’s part, also reflect degrees of
constraint. Particularly, an analyst may wish to perform Primary Attribution, yet only possess technical evidence of
the activity in question. In this case, irrespective of analyst desire, constraints should compel the analyst to focus
on Behavioral Attribution. Yet the danger inherent to this situation is a migration to General Attribution as a
“good enough” substitute for the rigors of Primary Attribution statements.
CTI analysts and vendors frequently demonstrate a mismatch between choice and constraints along the
limitations described above. Most often, we observe this disconnect where analysts desire greater “who-centric”
attribution than evidence permits, searching for a way to make statements such as “This organization is
responsible for the campaign.” Less frequently, analysts possessing significant additional knowledge beyond mere
technical observables may omit these items (or the conclusions that can be derived from them), typically to
preserve sources and methods of collection for such evidence which are often sensitive in nature.
In the latter case, the broader community is left wanting for more information and detail where such items are
actually available. While not necessarily desirable, such an action does not impose any significant cost or lead to
potentially incorrect analysis or misconceptions, at least from a pure network defense perspective. Such concerns
are, however, inherent to the former, when analysts wish to move beyond constraints to make pseudo-Primary
Attribution claims when necessary evidence is lacking. In these cases, a desire to move beyond the evidence
available, either through hypothesis or outright guesswork, can lead to outcomes that are indefensible and
outright incorrect. Examples would include misattributing identified behaviors to a definite entity, or somewhat
less concerningly making such claims (which may nonetheless appear likely) when the evidence simply doesn’t
exist to support.
That constraints exist on reporting ability and potential accuracy is undeniable, yet overcoming such constraints
raises several questions. Items include:

How can we move beyond evidence constraints on attribution?
How can analysts properly describe activity when constraints limit us to technical details?
Is it even desirable for analysts to push against evidentiary constraints toward more robust, “who-centric”
forms of attribution (the right side of the continuum)?

Moving beyond constraints is easily satisfied: analysts simply require more (and better) evidence. Yet the type of
evidence necessary is often beyond the reach of private sector CTI operations and usually cannot be distributed
or referenced in public reporting from government or law enforcement operations except in anomalous
situations. The type of evidence in question relates to “who-specific” findings typically associated with
government-run intelligence collection or law enforcement investigations. At times, private sector entities and
independent researchers can utilize this information when it is made public, and even more exceptionally uncover
such evidence independently. Especially valuable over the past few years are detailed indictments produced by
the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). DoJ indictments are typically treasure troves of information that
simply cannot be found elsewhere or through other (legal) means, including details such as organizational
hierarchies and even the identification of specific individuals involved in operations. In these cases, third-party
analysts can leverage this work and, through connection with known technical observables, make links between
information in indictments and previously-gathered technical evidence to make statements closer (although not
necessarily identical) to Primary Attribution.
When the evidence is simply not available to move beyond constraints, such limitations must be recognized and
embraced. In these situations, analysts face the frustrating—but necessary—task of grouping observations purely
based on technical observations. Multiple frameworks exist to either assist such activity, such as MITRE ATT&CK,
11
or outright define the process, like the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis.12 In any event, analysts must
remain faithful to the information available (technical observations) and not work to move beyond what such
evidence can support. This essentially means dwelling on the left side of the continuum, focusing on Behavioral
Attribution, linking observations to named clusters of activity as opposed to discrete entities or personas.
Yet in cases where evidence falls short, but desire (or necessity) requires pushing further to the right on the
attribution continuum toward Primary Attribution, what avenues are available? Some may argue that going “just
far enough” towards “who-centric” attribution to identify a plausible sponsor or directing state authority, even if
this falls well short of a specific identity, may suffice to add value. In this scenario, where available information is
insufficient to make a Primary Attribution statement such as “Sandworm, identified as Russian GRU Unit 74455,”
13
simply saying “Russian-related” or “likely of Russian origin” would appear to be acceptable. This type of General
Attribution, linking to a very broad entity (which consists of multiple subgroups and interests which may not all
work in concert with one another), seems enticing at first as a “halfway” point between Behavioral Attribution

and incredibly difficult Primary Attribution. But on further analysis, this concept seems to create far more issues
than it solves.

The “Mushy Middle” of Attribution
Extremes of attribution activity—behavior-only clustering and externally-enriched Primary Attribution of threat
actors— have been established and explored thus far. While there remains significant left- and right-tail space for
items that move slightly beyond Behavioral Attribution with additional evidence and items which may fall short of
complete Primary Attribution, a significant space exists between the two. In a previous section, we described this
as General Attribution—although here we will refer to this area primarily as the “mushy middle.”
The “mushy middle” consists of attribution statements which go far enough to name a general party—”China”,
“Romanian criminal gangs”, “Iranian interests”—but that do not go further to concrete entities within these
broader groupings. On the one hand, narrowing down activity from the universe of “all possible actors” to a
subset such as “Chinese-related threat actors” seems to be somewhat beneficial. Yet any such benefit derives
from a (mis)conception of country-level unitary actions with respect to cyber operations, their objectives, and
desired impacts.

Further examination and reflection reveals that general groupings—whether “Chinese interests” or “Bulgarian
criminal elements”—mask a diverse set of actors with varying motivations, TTPs, and intentions. Lazily lumping
activity under such a general label may seem productive at first, but under additional scrutiny such actions are
likely to facilitate bias or assumption rather than lead to greater analytical rigor and improved defensive
response. To further explore the “mushy middle” and its implications, we will consider several examples.

Reviewing Russian-Related Intrusion Operations and SUNBURST
Several high-profile incidents and resulting statements and analysis from multiple parties highlight a number of
worrying cyber operations linked to various Russian entities. As part of this, statements ranging from specific
identification of Russian government entities (and even the personnel staffing such agencies) exist, along with
more general claims of links to Russian-related “interests.” While saying “Russian-related” for a given
incident—such as the recently disclosed SUNBURST activity14—may appear on its face somewhat beneficial, this

classification papers over significant differences in Russian-nexus cyber operations. As documented elsewhere,
Russian intelligence operations are not only diverse, but at times functioning at cross-purposes or in competition.
15
Such rivalries make unitary attribution at just the level of “Russia” problematic, and this is before considering
operational and behavioral distinctions.
A significant history exists for Russian-sponsored disruptive cyber operations, ranging from the 2015 and 2016
Ukraine electric sector events to the 2017 NotPetya incident.16 Yet the common thread uniting these incidents
(and subsequent reporting and analysis) is Primary Attribution. As made clear in public statements, indictments,
and sanctions from the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries, these operations were all
perpetrated by Russian military intelligence (GRU), specifically Unit 74455.17 While this may appear so much
trivia at first, such information must be put in context of other Russian-related operations that did not result in
disruptive or destructive impacts, which have aligned to other elements of Russia’s intelligence services: either
the civilian intelligence agencies, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) or Federal Security Service (FSB), or even
other elements of the GRU such as Unit 26165 (commonly referred to as APT28 or Fancy Bear).18

Although at present additional evidence and details are sadly unavailable, multiple leaks from US government
officials linking SUNBURST to SVR and not GRU activity is significant,19 even though both groups ultimately take
orders from Russian national command authority.20 The reason is the operational history of these groups. While
GRU operations—especially those linked to Sandworm, or Unit 74455—are frequently linked to disruptive or
outright destructive operations, no such parallel exists with historical SVR-linked activity. Instead, SVR-linked
operations (commonly tracked as APT29 or Cozy Bear, although additional subgroups likely exist)
overwhelmingly focus on traditional espionage activities with no evidence of disruptive activity.
In this example, an attribution statement going just far enough to say “Russia” is not only unhelpful, but potentially
misleading given the differing operational profiles, intentions, and histories of specific Russian-linked threat
actors. A General Attribution statement related to SUNBURST operations thus seems less than ideal, and

perhaps creates more confusion absent additional evidence allowing for a Primary Attribution statement linking
the activity to a specific entity under Russian command authority.
Differentiation among actors, taking into consideration their different goals, interests, and likely intentions, is
therefore critical in properly dispositioning the SUNBURST and related activity. If such activity could be linked to
an entity such as GRU Unit 74455, the commensurate defensive Differentiation among actors, taking into
consideration their different goals, interests, and likely intentions, is therefore critical in properly dispositioning
the SUNBURST and related activity. If such activity could be linked to an entity such as GRU Unit 74455, the
commensurate defensive response and fallout would be dramatically different than if (as seems likely given
current information) such actions are instead linked to more traditional espionage operations instead.

HAFNIUM Operations and Widespread Vulnerability Exploitation
Another example of General Attribution statements adding little of value—and potentially leading to
misconceptions in understanding and responding to an event—lies in widespread exploitation of
CVE-2021-26855 (“ProxyLogon”) and related vulnerabilities in March 2021.21 When initially disclosed by
Microsoft on 02 March 2021, the activity in question was limited to an activity group identified as HAFNIUM that
paired Exchange exploitation with several privilege escalation vulnerabilities, to both capture email on victimized
servers as well as to install webshells for further access. While derived via Behavioral Attribution, Microsoft’s
original public blog also noted that HAFNIUM is “assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China,” a
General Attribution statement.22

exploitation activity exploded with various media outlets reporting 20-30,000 entities victimized in the U.S. alone
within days of public vulnerability disclosure.24 Most significantly, several additional, distinct entities beyond
HAFNIUM started abusing this vulnerability—shortly after public disclosure and in several cases just prior.25
While non-Microsoft reporting emphasized multiple distinct groups exploiting the Exchange vulnerability from
the start media reporting and popular conceptions latched onto the initial General Attribution statement from
Microsoft: that CVE-2021-26855 and related Microsoft Exchange exploitation is correlated with HAFNIUM,
HAFNIUM is linked to China, and therefore all such activity is linked to Chinese operations.
There are several problems with the logic in the previous statement. First, and as demonstrated in reporting from
FireEye and Volexity, it was already debatable as to whether exploitation from January 2021 onward is linked to a
single entity. Following public disclosure (and the ability to reverse engineer the Exchange patches), exploitation
possibilities rapidly expand as the vulnerability shifts from a “Zero Day” to a “N-Day.”26 Although evidence is
uncertain as of this writing, available information suggests that one to six distinct groups were exploiting the
ProxyLogon vulnerability prior to public disclosure, with multiple potential additional entities opportunistically

doing so after the patch release and vulnerability identification.27 Even in cases where use of the chained
exploitation of the set of Exchange vulnerabilities first linked to HAFNIUM results in the deployment of the same
toolset (such as the widely available China Chopper webshell), diversity in precise tool configuration and other
details strongly indicates multiple, distinct entities are engaged in the underlying activity.28

Second, the association of HAFNIUM with “China” raises concerns. HAFNIUM may very well be associated with
Chinese authorities or interests, but such a high-level association (to “China” as opposed to anything specific
about the People’s Republic and its various military, intelligence, contracting, and criminal entities) does little to
assist defense, response, or even higher-level strategy. As stated previously, postulating “China” as a unitary
object—with uniform behaviors and intentions in cyber operations—simply ignores the reality of diverse entities
executing cyber intrusions with ties to Chinese authorities.

Since Chinese authorities established the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support Force (SSF) in
December 2015,29 Chinese-associated cyber activities increasingly bifurcate between traditional espionage
operations and military cyber operations focused technical intelligence along with offensive and defensive
actions. Typical views of China-linked cyber operations focus on extensive intellectual property theft and
espionage activity. The formation of the SSF, and its Network Systems Department (NSD) component, combined
former military espionage operations (PLA Third Department) and offensive cyber missions (PLA Fourth
Department) into a single entity focused on military specific missions and support. Meanwhile, increased diversity
of operations by the Chinese civilian Ministry of State Security (MSS) indicates a possible separation of duties in
overall espionage operations between SSF/NSD and MSS from the mid-2010s onward. While the SSF/NSD
appears to largely concentrate on military-supporting capabilities in cyber offense and defense, MSS (and its
various contractors and regional units) remain focused on espionage and technology theft operations.30 Although
exceptions certainly exist,31 the overall trajectory of Chinese state computer network operations activity since
the SSF’s formation reflects an increasingly firm separation of duties between military and civilian intelligence
authorities.
Furthermore, in addition to the SSF-MSS bifurcation, a thriving contractor-based, “hack-for-hire” ecosystem also
exists within China. Most clearly demonstrated through the confusing cluster of activity referred to as “Winnti,”32
a complex system of relationships exists between actual operating entities and sponsors or directing authorities.
Such tangled links have confounded multiple researchers and analysts, leading to a confusing mess of activity
clusters and incomplete attribution. HAFNIUM may fall into this category, making assessment of this group’s
intentions, motivations, and operational direction more confusing still.

From all of these observations, a faulty reading of “China”-associated cyber operations could lead to an
assumption that compromised organizations are only of value to the extent they possess valuable intellectual
property or similar information. Yet the diversity of Chinese strategic interests and possible operational
goals—including the possibility of building up deniable proxy infrastructure through which to conduct future
operations, including offensive actions—means that all assumptions of potential Exchange exploitation purpose
simply based on a link to “China” are either insupportable or meaningless given numerous plausible options.
Furthermore, that post-disclosure opportunistic exploitation of the vulnerabilities in Exchange are now lumped
into unitary activity by a single agent engenders additional problems. Given information available at the time of
this writing, the Behavioral Attribution statements made by Microsoft, FireEye, and others seem defensible and
desirable, while subsequent General Attribution statements by Microsoft and popular media generate little more
than confusion with respect to this activity.

The Multitude of Possible Midpoint Errors
The two examples provided—linked to Russian and Chinese cyber operations, respectively—may appear to limit
this discussion to large, complex, and well-resourced cyber powers. And yet with minimal investigation, similar
concerns arise in other areas as well. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Iran, and even the
United States (and other members of the Five Eyes (FVEY) SIGINT-sharing partnership)33 do not represent
monolithic entities with complete unification over cyber capabilities, missions, and objectives. Rather, these
entities represent complex arrangements with multiple units performing missions ranging from traditional
espionage collection to internal security operations to pre-positioning for future conflict (commonly referred to
as “operational preparation of the environment,” or OPE).34
Simply saying that a given activity is the act or aligns with the interest of a given country or authority leaves so
much space for inferring actual intentionality as to be meaningless at best, or misleading at worst. Although
seemingly not as complex, the interaction and overlap between criminal organizations and entities operating in
the e-crime ecosystem is not far off from the complexity of state services.35 In these spaces, as seen in the
explosion of actors and service providers facilitating ransomware since at least 2018, an entire ecosystem
spanning initial access, subsequent penetration, and ultimate network ransom operations exists.36 Thus, making
general claims about regions or similar does little to shed light on the specifics of adversary operations given the
diversity of actors across multiple geographies operating within this space.

Overall, General Attribution statements may appear, on their face, to add greater clarity to matters as they
seemingly narrow activity down to a generalized actor, but in practice such statements merely give in to inherent
biases and preconceived notions on given general adversary tendencies. At the same time, General Attribution
does little to actually elucidate specific motivations and intentions for the matter at hand. As a result, General
Attribution statements represent so much “junk food” for analysts and external observers, providing some
abstracted glimpse of “who” might be responsible for a given activity while lacking the rigor or specificity required
for either network defense or strategic planning and response.

Orienting Cyber Threat Intelligence to Defensible
Attribution Actions
If CTI attribution remains locked between separate “poles” of Behavioral Attribution and Primary Attribution,
with limited ability to migrate from behaviors to specific entities and a likely misleading middle lying in between,
what should be the goal of CTI attributive statements? Put exceptionally simply, the goal of attribution within the
concepts of operational cyber security is quite succinct: attributive statements should seek to assist network
defenders. In this fashion, the “mushy middle” described above fails to reach the necessary evidentiary rigor of
Primary Attribution while muddying Behavioral Attribution by tapping into preconceived notions or artificial
expectations of state- or group-level conduct as though these were always monolithic, unitary objects.
The above is not to say that Primary Attribution statements are useless for network defenders. They can in fact
be quite valuable to the degree that such statements enable direct links to real entities from which we can then
reasonably infer intention and purpose. Identification to this level of specificity can cement understanding of
adversary behaviors and TTPs, while also facilitating understanding of intruder or attacker goals. When
performed properly and accurately, such identification can be invaluable for defensive response and triage. For
example, being able to differentiate between a likely espionage campaign and a potentially disruptive operation
would be invaluable for response actions to a given breach, as discussed in the SUNBURST example above.
Yet while desirable, the likelihood that such information will be available (given evidence requirements),
actionable (due to possible controls over the use and dissemination of information), or timely (since gathering
Primary Attribution evidence takes time) will often be incredibly low. Certainly attribution to specific entities
(and motivations) is valuable when it can take place, but as evidenced by the months or years-long separation
between public statements and actual events in U.S. indictments or the sanctions and public reports of other
countries, the likelihood of such information being timely and actionable is quite small.

Instead, by remaining within existing and supportable evidentiary boundaries, CTI analysts can ensure attribution
claims remain grounded in available data while still providing critical support to network defenders and related
parties. Such discipline allows CTI reporting to detail how intrusions take place, even if why and by whom remain
mysteries. Furthermore, CTI analysts will also avoid generic, largely unhelpful statements such as “this appears to
align with Russian intentions” that provide no appreciable value for defensive operations and may ultimately lead
to misconceptions and ill-thought assumptions instead given the diversity of such interests.
While the “mushy middle” may succeed in claiming soundbites, conference presentations, and media mentions,
this arena fails to provide much in the way of actionable, useful information for network defenders. Relation to a
general “interest” or abstract “intention” simply does not provide enough fidelity into adversary motivation and
objectives to engender improved defensive responses. Instead, such an approach generates a superficial feeling of
“adversary identification” when such identification resembles little more than the toss of a weighted die.
Furthermore, General Attribution provides little for audiences typically more interested in Primary Attribution
statements, such as policymakers and strategic decision makers. For their actions to truly matter, just pointing a
finger at “China” or similar does little more than provide a performative statement—actual, concrete action
demands narrowing down responsible entities to specific parties. In this way, responses ranging from sanctions to
indictments to possible cyber “counterstrikes” are enabled.37 Failure to provide sufficient detail on such matters
to this type of audience therefore does little to enable any impactful or effective action in the realm of cyber
operations, deterrence, or response. While “who” can and, depending on the audience, certainly does matter in
cyber defensive operations, the evidentiary standard of reaching “who-based” attribution is well beyond that
which is expressed by many entities operating in the public sphere.
Given the above arguments. General Attribution represents a lazy midpoint between grounded Behavioral
Attribution and more robust (but rarely achieved, and if so even more rarely made public) Primary Attribution
activities. General Attribution statements are certainly possible, and potentially (if vacuously) supportable to
some degree. Yet given the evidence available to many CTI analysts, the combination of assumptions made in
performing General Attribution combined with lack of any noticeable, material value make this an undesirable,
pointless endeavor. Where analysts can proceed toward more robust attribution statements defining specific

groups, organizations, or persons, we should use all tools and evidence in our power to do so. But given the rare
situations where this can be achieved, CTI analysts and commercial vendors are advised to remain firmly
grounded in making Behavioral Attribution claims which are supported by evidence, which also happen to be the
statements of most immediate utility to on-the-ground network defenders.

A Note on Names
One final consideration relates to naming linked to CTI attributive actions.38 Analysts and external observers are
familiar with a diverse series of names from various vendors, organizations, and other parties describing what
seems, on its face, to be identical (or at least overlapping) activity. One typical and convincing argument
concerning the profusion of threat actor names, including when referring to the same activity, is that analysts
should avoid using the terminology of others due to different sources, clustering methodologies, and visibility.39
This approach makes sense and ties in to the epistemic realities of typical analyst visibility and available evidence.
Yet as noted in prior sections, this activity aligns with a certain sector of our attribution continuum, namely
Behavioral Attribution based on clustering of observables.
As illustrated below, unless an analyst finds themselves in the improbable position of omniscience with respect to
the set of all possible observations of a given threat, campaign, or other action, at best analysts will work with a
subset of observations. Furthermore, different analysts, utilizing different sources or possessing different
visibility into matters, will have perspectives on matters that, although frequently overlapping, are not necessarily
exact—and this is before we delve in to matters of methodology which may result in different clustering actions.
In this case, unless third parties have visibility into both the methodology and corpus of evidence used to derive a
cluster name, Behavioral Attribution terms should be distinct among different analysts.

Matters change when we proceed along the attribution continuum towards Primary Attribution. In this situation,
names are not linked to varying clusters of related observations, but instead designate a specific entity,
organization, or person in the world. In these cases, a profusion of names for precisely the same thing is both

unhelpful and absurd. As previously documented, CTI analysts will rarely be able to migrate toward Primary
Attribution statements, and halfway General Attribution claims are similarly unhelpful as well as imprecise.
Therefore the issue of name profusion for specific, existing entities is not common—but it does occur.
To explore further, we can look at the 2018 indictment of two Chinese nationals by the U.S. Department of Justice
for intellectual property theft campaigns.40 Prior to the indictment, CTI analysts and vendors tracked the activity
in question under various names such as APT10, Cloud Hopper, POTASSIUM, Stone Panda, and other terms.41
While such tracking made sense—given different visibility and analytical methodology—prior to the indictment
(and its treasure trove of Primary Attribution evidence), after its release the activity was linked to a specific
entity: Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company, operating on behalf of or in conjunction
with the Chinese MSS’s Tianjin State Security Bureau. At this point, the activities tracked as APT10, Stone Panda,
Cloud Hopper, etc., coalesce around a specific entity in the world—and the cryptonyms no longer make sense, at
least in the context of activity specifically described in the indictment.
For describing the campaigns in the 2018 DoJ document, use of the vendor-specific cryptonyms becomes useful
only insofar as it allows us to link the Primary Attribution statements within the document to prior analysis when
such evidence was unavailable. A proper way of referencing the activity would therefore resemble something
along the lines of, “cyber intrusions executed by Huaying Haitai, previously tracked as APT10,” or similar. But
continuing to use the cryptonyms exclusively without reference to the named, identified responsible party
muddies analysis and enables continuous confusion.
Where matters become less clear are in future research and analysis of activity, similar to previous discussions
concerning the “decay” of linked Primary Attribution statements over time. Using the same example as above,
Primary Attribution evidence allows for the identification of a specific entity responsible for items previously
tracked as Cloud Hopper, etc.—but future activity, absent continued collection and availability of Primary
Attribution evidence, will lack equivalent visibility. In these cases, visibility- and methodology-specific names may
reemerge as problems of evidence availability and perspective return. However, future statements can at least
anchor themselves in prior Primary Attribution statements by noting the historical link to a definite entity, and
the possibility that future observations reflect a continuation of this link. At this stage, we reach the rightward
section of the attribution continuum, but fall short of pure or complete Primary Attribution possibilities. Instead,
we can only make assessments of a continued link to the named entity in past Prior Attribution work until
sufficient evidence becomes available to re-establish the “who”-specific link.

Conclusion
Attribution is a thorny subject in CTI discussion, but through further examination and analysis we can reveal the
concept not as a binary choice but rather a selection along a continuum of options. These range from purely
behavior-based analysis and linking on technical information to robust, all-source identification of specific
organizations or even individual persons responsible for a given incident.
Although attribution maps to a continuum with a near infinite variety of possibilities, thorough examination of
attribution outcomes reveals a mushy, undesirable middle ground between the two poles described above. Due to
a variety of factors, many (if not most) CTI analysts and their respective employers will be unable to push very far
from the leftward pole of Behavioral Attribution. Yet in desiring to achieve something more akin to Primary
Attribution, CTI practitioners must beware a middle ground of General Attribution that provides little real value
to either network defenders or higher-level policymakers and strategic audiences, while also introducing
assumptions and overly broad classifications that confuse decision-making and follow-on analysis.
Even though the temptation to CTI analysts is strong to make general associative statements linking a given
activity or incident to a country or high-level group, further examination indicates these are at best misleading
and at worst potentially harmful. Understanding that groups, from state-sponsored cyber operations to complex
criminal networks, are not unitary objects but rather contain various interest centers, points of focus, and
operational teams highlights that simply saying “this incident is related to Country X” does little to advance the
field of network defense on any practical level. By understanding the continuum of attribution choices and the
constraints forced on these choices through available data and evidence, CTI practitioners can remain grounded
in what sources are accessible while also improving support to consumers of CTI.
