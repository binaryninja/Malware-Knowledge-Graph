Wizard Spider Case Report

Introduction

This report shows the results of the PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) Team’s
comprehensive investigation into the Wizard Spider cybercrime group. The group is
also known by the various malware variants it uses (Ryuk, Trickbot, and Conti, among others).
It is a financially motivated cybercrime group first identified in 2017, and may be one of
the wealthiest groups currently in operation, with total assets easily in excess hundreds of
millions of dollars.
The group’s extraordinary profitability allows its leaders to invest in illicit research and
development initiatives. Wizard Spider is fully capable of hiring specialist talent, building new
digital infrastructure, and purchasing access to advanced exploits. It has also apparently
invested in its own panel-hosting cracking application and hired telephone operators to
cold-call victims and scare them into paying.
The PTI team has been actively tracking the Wizard Spider group since releasing our first
public report in November 2021. This prevented hundreds of ransomware attacks and
notified more than 128000 victims that were targeted by the group. These victims include
defense and aerospace companies, food producers, supply chain providers, hospitals,
government agencies, and critical infrastructure providers. We obtained visibility into critical
elements of the group’s infrastructure and collected vital data on its kill chain, as shown below.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Executive Summary

Wizard Spider is a highly profitable cybercrime group that operates a number of
sophisticated malware variants in its attacks. The PTI team has been collecting data on
Wizard Spider’s operations since publishing its first report on Conti in November 2021.
Our team has discovered valuable new information about Wizard Spider and its relationship
to other cybercrime groups and software producers. This report contains technical analysis
on Wizard Spider’s capabilities and its command structure, which includes a complex set of
sub-teams divided into software-specific groups. Wizard Spider is capable of managing
attacks from start to finish using its own distributed capabilities, assigning pre-attack
preparations to certain teams and post-exploitation tasks to others.

Figure 2. Risks to contain Wizard Spider’s attack at each stage.

This report will help organizations prepare for highly coordinated cyberattacks that use
distributed command structures to exploit high-value targets. Its insights will help security
professionals protect sensitive data and assets from the multiple exploitation stages that
characterize a Wizard Spider attack. Note that risks and costs to contain these attacks
increase at later stages, as shown in Figure 2.
The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team is publishing this data now to help information
security leaders detect and respond to attacks that use malware variants in Wizard Spider’s
technology stack. Recent public leaks about the threat actors behind Conti ransomware
have pushed our publication deadline ahead of schedule. The PTI team has extensively
covered Conti ransomware in the past, and is now extending that investigation by publishing
new data and insights into the inner workings of Wizard Spider.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Technical Analysis

This section outlines the tools, techniques, and tactics Wizard Spider uses to carry out
its attacks. It contains vital information about the group’s distribution mechanism, locker
sample, intrusion server, extortion server, backup storage, and the hash cracking station.
Based on our observations, the team’s attack starts with the mass-scale spam campaign
using QBot and proxy malware (SystemBC) with the help of compromised business email
conversations. Then, another team uses domain-based selection to pinpoint the valuable
targets for their ransom demands and deploy Cobalt Strike for lateral movement activities.
If the intrusion team successfully obtains the domain admin privilege, they deploy Conti’s
ransomware strain. This section provides our findings on their operational environment.

3.1

Hypervisor Encryption Server

During the investigation, the PTI team discovered a unique system used by the Wizard
Spider’s sub-team that targets the hypervisor servers (e.g., VMWare ESXi) with the Conti
ransomware strain. After threat actors exfiltrate data from their victim’s servers, they prepare
and upload a special locker software on their own Locker Software Server. This locker
software directly targets hypervisor servers and encrypts them, leaving a ransom note on
the desktop, in the characteristic style of a typical Conti ransomware attack.
Further investigation revealed that the attackers directly scanned and exploited hundreds of
VMware vCenter servers with Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerabilities.[3] Interestingly, several
scanner IP addresses were also used as Cobalt Strike C2 servers in the subsequent attacks.

3.1.1

Auto-Locker Deployment

At the time of our analysis, the PTI team detected and performed detailed analysis on
the following Hypervisor Encryption Server.

Table 1. Hypervisor encryption server details.

The PTI team’s investigation into the target host allowed us to gain access to Wizard
Spider’s auto-encryption panel. The panel expects several input to perform their
tasks. By inputting victim access credentials obtained via SOCKS IPs, threat actors
could drop locker malware directly onto victim’s devices and servers. The SOCKS proxy IP
addresses that were used generally connect with Cobalt Strike servers used by Wizard Spider.
If this locker attack fails, threat actors will reuse the same locker software for other attacks.
Each of the fields on the panel has a specific role to play encrypting victims’ servers.

After locker panel activation, the software establishes a connection with the VPN using the
access keys on the victim’s device. Immediately upon being seized, SSH credentials are
created for each victim’s virtual machine. The locker software’s operations on the machine
can be tracked, as seen in Figure 4. Table 2 shows some of the example locker software
servers used by the Wizard Spider team to deploy Conti ransomware.

After receiving arguments from the threat actor, the malware checks whether the ”detach”
feature is specified. If the feature is specified, the malware ”forks”, terminating the parent
process and continuing with a ”child” process on the victim system.
Then, the malware makes the necessary adjustments for encryption. Reverse engineering
studies showed that the malware performs ”initialization” with the ”Public Key” in ASN.1 format
using the ”CryptoPP” library.

Figure 6. Locker software initialization of encryption method.

At the last stage, the malware uses a ”callback” function for all the files it finds and follows
the path specified in the ”path” argument. This ”callback” function checks whether the
”–prockiller” feature is activated. The ”–prockiller” feature searches for processes with names
specified in the ”/proc” file system and checks if the related file is executable. The malware
immediately terminates every named process it finds in the file system. After the process
checking stage, the malware checks the extensions it contains. If the file extension is on the
list, the malware will refuse to encrypt that type of file. Figure 7 shows the locker parameters
obtained from ContiLeaks and verifies our findings.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Post-Exploitation Infrastructure

Before engaging the scenarios described above, threat actors use many different
methods to research targets, scan for vulnerabilities, and attempt zero-day exploits through
intrusion servers. We identified several intrusion servers belonging to Wizard Spider threat
actors. They contain tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors, purchased
zero-day exploits, connected server addresses, Bitcoin addresses marked for payment, and
various sensitive data on their operational environment. Threat actors kept notes to share
between the teams in the form of encrypted ZIP files.

3.2.1

Intrusion Servers

During the investigation of Wizard Spider’s intrusion servers, the PTI team obtained
visibility into multiple critical elements of the group’s infrastructure. We obtained valuable
information on tools, user manual files, and existing techniques, tactics, and procedures that
threat actors use to test and attack victims’ systems. Table 4 shows the two servers that are
associated to the Wizard Spider team.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Exploitation Toolset

The Wizard Spider team uses custom toolkit that can exploit zero-day/one-day/n-day
vulnerabilities in their attacks in addition to public tools. The most recent one is the Log4j
vulnerability mentioned in previous sections. During the PTI team’s analysis of Wizard Spider’s
intrusion servers, our analysts determined that the Wizard Spider team purchased and used
zero-day exploits from other threat actors and used current and public vulnerabilities. This
finding was corroborated with the information published by Contileaks as well. For simplicity,
only some of the samples are showed in this section. However, entire toolkit data can be
shared with the researchers upon request.
Upon detailed analysis of files on the intrusion server, the PTI team detected a domain named
hidusi.com in emergency.html file. Examining the domain logs of the file, our team determined
that Wizard Spider was currently managing a server that exploited the CVE-2021-40444
zero-day vulnerability.[5] This zero-day vulnerability impacts Microsoft Word and Microsoft
Explorer with malicious documents that deliver a customized version of Cobalt Strike BEACON.

Figure 11. Example usage of CVE-2021-40444 exploit.

In addition, a file named zero.exe was discovered on the same server. Upon analysis, it
appeared to establish a connection with the Security Account Manager’s database on the
target system with administrator’s account credentials using ZeroLogon vulnerability. To
trigger the corresponding exploit, the threat actor must provide the following parameters :
Target IP Address, Domain Controller Name, Domain Name, and Admin Username. The same
exploit and its usage can be found in ContiLeaks’s public release (internal TrickBot forum).

Cracking Station

The PTI team detected and performed a detailed analysis on the custom hash cracking
system of the Wizard Spider team. This system stores cracked hashes, updates threat
actors on the cracking status and shows the results of cracking attempts on other servers.
The system can crack the LM:NTLM hashes, cached domain credentials, Kerberos 5
TGS-REP/AS-REP tickets, KeePass files, MS Office 2013 files, and other types of common
hashes. Moreover, the cracking station features the following five elements :
1. The hash value (MD5, SHA1, etc.) that the attackers wish to crack.
2. Description text that reflects individual victim information.
3. Priority value, which allows attackers to focus on high-value targets first.
4. Status text shows how the cracking process is going.
5. The result field contains the decrypted version of the hash value.

Figure 13. Management panel of the Cracking Station.

Figure 13 shows the management screen of the cracking station. While analyzing the hashes
inserted into the database by attackers, we detected a lot of Russian comments (as shown
in Figure 14). Apparently teams use comments as a simple communication tool. In addition
to communication, the privileged users track the activity to determine the workload of the
threat actors. Therefore, the cracking station plays a crucial role in the team’s operational
environment.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Cold-Calling System

Wizard Spider team uses cold-calling to scare non-responsive victims into paying using
a custom VoIP system.[4] The internal conversation (as shown in Figure 15) between the
threat actors obtained from the ContiLeaks shows the features of the cold-calling systems.

Figure 15. Internal conversation between the threat actors on the cold-calling system.

The PTI team successfully detected and analyzed the cold-calling system developed
by the threat actors (as shown in Figure 16). This system is used to store reports of calls,
helping various sub-teams coordinate when pressuring victims further. Types of information
regarding each call are ;
1. The unique victim name set by threat actors.
2. Timestamp of the ransomware attack.
3. The group ID of the user responsible.
4. Called status shows ”1” for successful calls and ”0” for unsuccessful ones or calls not yet
made.
5. Internal ID (locked_id) used by Conti threat actors to track victims.

Daily Cobalt Strikes Beacons

Threat actors generate Cobalt Strike beacons for each team on a daily bases as shown
in Figure 17. PTI team has been proactively monitoring all Cobalt Strike samples and notifying
the clients to prevent further ransomware attacks. They use different servers and domain
names for each sample to avoid detection. However, most samples connect to servers
(some of them are listed in Section 6) residing in ReliableSite data center.

Figure 17. Team formations and daily generated Cobalt Strike beacons.

The public ContiLeaks provided insight into the intrusion team’s team structure and enriched
our findings. For instance, Figure 18 shows the team leaders and work-specific details. We
think that our findings and public leaks will shed light on the inner structures of the Wizard
Spider team.

Extortion Servers

The victim’s stolen data is typically transferred to an extortion server (using rclone or similar
data transfer tool) via a proxy network established using Wireguard VPN before deploying
the ransomware. We detected several storage servers containing the victim’s data during the
PTI team’s investigation. Interestingly, we identified several folders belonging to the victims
who agreed to pay the ransom. This finding is an excellent example that we should not trust
ransomware operators. Table 6 shows the excerpt list of the storage servers.

REvil Relation

The extortion servers periodically transfer their data to a backup server in Russia, which has
a considerable disk size (~26TB). One of the most striking findings is that some of the victims
in the backup storage were attacked by the REvil ransomware gang around Q1/2021. It
presents a worrying example of the collaboration between the ransomware gangs. However,
we do not have any further information to confirm whether the Wizard Spider team carried
out these attacks or the stolen data transferred from REvil’s servers into backup storage.

3.3.2

Proxy Network

The PTI team determined that threat actors manage victim extortion processes and file
transfers through a proxy network using WebDAV service, as some of the parts of them are

VPN Infrastructure

It appears Wizard Spider manages all internal and external traffic through extensive
Wireguard configurations and VPN connections. They even provide access to newly added
extortion servers through Wireguard instead of accessing them externally. The below lines
show the sample Wireguard config file.
[Interface]
Address = 10.1.2.1/24
ListenPort = 51871

Console 1. Sample Wireguard config file.

The team uses a publicly available Croc tool to transfer the FTP or VPN configuration files
apart from the private keys. They attempt to hide their traces by setting a relay server at the
81.4.109.61 (RamNode -Netherlands) IP address. This relay server contains multiple instances
running on different ports (9009, 9010, 9011, 9012, and 9013). The PTI team observed threat
actors regularly transferring configuration files for operational needs. Some of the observed
executed Croc commands are listed below :
–pass xxx –relay ”81.4.109.61:9009” send /etc/vsftpd
• croc

3.3.4

QBot Relation

While investigating QBot’s database, the PTI team observed that the threat actors
obtained several PST files from the Wizard Spider’s extortion servers. The PST files contained
email information used in phishing campaigns and critical file detection tasks. The QBot
panel occasionally parses these PST files obtained from victims, including victims who have
paid the ransom, to send targeted spam emails. The resulting files are added directly to this
database and transferred to remote servers via FTP.

Author Profiling and Linguistic Evidence

Deep sensors planted by the PTI team can capture, interrupt, and react to information
traffic between the cybercriminals in secret and public communication channels. We
accumulate linguistic evidence to strengthen our criminal profiling capabilities as part of our
cyber attribution efforts. AUCH (Autorenprofile für die Untersuchung von Cyberkriminalität
CH) is our recently developed deep neural networks empowered author profiling technology.
AUCH can analyze the language of cybercriminals to reveal important information regarding
their identities. It operates based on data and cyber-insight we have acquired over the
years with our unparalleled proactive approach against cybercrime. Our initial report 1 on
the Conti cybercrime group covered the possible connections to the Russian Federation
and the Russian language, and we have extended our earlier analysis in this report and
reinforced our attribution.

Wizard Spider Case Report

The individuals behind the Conti group are known to be well-trained and well-resourced,
and they seem to have a certain level of proficiency in the English language. However, AUCH
was able to identify various linguistic cues to reveal the native language of the author based
on the acquired messages. Our inference engine recognized the suspected connections
and concluded that a native Russian speaker wrote the statements. AUCH exploits the
recent developments in XAI (Explainable artificial intelligence) to generate human-friendly
explanations on the gradient and attention level to provide our threat intelligence analysts
with the necessary information to work towards robust cyber-attribution. [2, 1] We will be
limiting our argumentation with three different meaningful examples generated by AUCH to
show how our system captures different linguistic relationships.
3.5.1

Syntax

Conti Statement : As a response to Western warmongering and American threats to use
cyber warfare against the citizens of (missing : the) Russian Federation.
The profiler identified the misuse of ”determiners” in the English statements published by
Conti and seemed to put it to use to narrow down the list of potential languages. The final
prediction of our system, the Russian language, is known to be lacking the use of determiners.
The inconsistent use of determiners is a well-known mistake amongst English L2 speakers.
3.5.2

Grammaticality

Conti Statement : We will use our resources in order to strike back if the well-being and
safety of peaceful citizens (will) be at stake due to American cyber aggression.
The profiler points out the faulty tense sequence in the dependent clause of the conditional
sentence.
3.5.3

Choice of Vocabulary

Conti Statement : Therefore, it did not publish in free access.
In this example, the inference engine pays special attention to the phrases ”did not publish”
and ”free access.” It seems to be the leading cue for our final inference of the Russian
language. This situation can be explained by the literal translation of the Russian sentence
(в свободном доступе.). On the other hand, a native speaker of English would probably
prefer the sentence ”It was not published freely/publicly/in the public domain.”

AUCH is currently a preliminary stage research project supported by the Swiss
Innovation Agency, Innosuisse. We collaborate with our partners at the University
of Zurich to integrate cutting-edge linguistics research into cybersecurity. In the
upcoming months, we will be able to showcase more features we work on to support
our investigations and consolidate our scientific approach against cybercrime.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Statistics and Observations

The PTI team correlated victim details obtained from multiple affiliate accounts and
servers to determine that the Wizard Spider group has successfully infected thousands of
devices around the world. Almost all of the group’s targets are enterprise-level corporations.
We were able to use this data to glean insight into some of the behavioral patterns,
workflows, and activity timelines characteristic of Wizard Spider threat actors.

4.1

Victim Statistics

Wizard Spider uses a cluster of SystemBC servers to control thousands of client devices
around the world.[6] If a victim appears to be a valuable target, threat actors will deploy
Cobalt Strike or similar software to escalate privileges and move laterally through the network.
The PTI team identified more than 128036 SystemBC victims in total. The SystemBC victim
data shows Wizard Spider threat actors mostly targeted Russia 20.5% and the United States
12.9%. Although it is seen that threat actors statistically identify victims originating from Russia
at a high rate, none of them are encountered in the Cracking or Encryption stages of the
attack cycle. All details regarding victim origins are shown in Figure 21.

Figure 21. SystemBC victim distribution by country (Total Victim : 128036).

While these two countries are by far the most popular targets, it’s worth pointing out that other
major economies like China, India, and Brazil are also well represented. Wizard Spider has a
significant presence in almost every developed country in the world, and many emerging
economies as well.

SystemBC data also indicated when Wizard Spider threat actors were most active. While
there is activity stretching back to the end of 2021, it mostly represents small-scale attacks.
These could be experiments designed to test and fine-tune various aspects of Wizard
Spider’s operation, because full-scale attacks targeting thousands of users at a time began
shortly thereafter, in late January and early February. After a short pause, a major initiative
took place at the end of February, resulting in tens of thousands of new victims by early
March. Figure 22 depicts the monthly victim statistics.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Cracking Station Activity

Wizard Spider operates its own separate cracking station and makes it available to
affiliates and users, possibly for a price. The PTI team was able to track cracking station
activity timelines and generate a chart showing peak usage hours.
Interestingly, it looks like relatively few threat actors made use of Wizard Spider’s specialty
cracking tool. There is a slight increase in users logging on weekday afternoons, but
not enough to indicate regular, sustained use. It’s also likely that users did not have to
remain logged into the cracking station long when using it, making overall activity look scarce.

Wizard Spider Case Report

Conclusion

Our investigation into Wizard Spider had yielded valuable new information about how the
group works, what tools it uses, and how its members distribute tasks between themselves.
These insights will help cybersecurity professionals and enterprise executives make better
risk management decisions. New indicators of compromise will give threat intelligence
operatives better visibility into Wizard Spider attack patterns, improving operational security
across the board.
It’s difficult to overestimate the impact of publishing these findings on a group as large and
well-funded as Wizard Spider. With hundreds of thousands of devices infected and a highly
distributed professional workflow, even the most conservative estimates indicate Wizard
Spider commands hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.
The Wizard Spider team has shown itself capable of monetizing multiple aspects of its
operations. It is responsible for an enormous quantity of spam on hundreds of millions of
millions of devices, as well as concentrated data breaches and ransomware attacks on
high-value targets. We’ve quantified the scale of each attack stage in Figure 2.
The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team continues to research Wizard Spider’s capabilities
and infrastructure to identify new and better defenses against its attacks. Security
professionals and enterprise IT leaders can use this data to catch early indicators of
compromise that correspond to Wizard Spider operations and the tactics of the various
sub-teams it works with, including the Conti ransomware group.
