In the wild: Yes

OVERVIEW
Infection Channel: Spammed via email, Downloaded from the Internet
Malware belonging to the SASFIS family are known to be downloaded on systems while
visiting sites that have been compromised using a particular exploit pack known as
"Eleonore". SASFIS variants are also being sent via spammed messages such as the
spoofed messages that purported to come from Facebook and iTunes Store. The said email
messages have a .ZIP file attachment that contained TROJ_SASFIS.HN.
It is also known to be associated with FAKEAV variants that are downloaded onto systems
when visiting pornographic sites. Though viewed as a simple downloader, SASFIS opens
affected systems to botnet attacks, particularly ZeuS and BREDOLAB.
SASFIS have been spotted as early as 2009. Affected systems that may play part in botnet
operations, are susceptible to data theft, and are difficult to clean up.
Cybercriminals behind the SASFIS malware use pay-per-install (PPI) and pay-per-access
(PPA) business models to earn money.
PPI business model: Cybercriminals behind other malware families like ZeuS and
BREDOLAB pay SASFIS creators for other malware to be downloaded and installed on
systems that have been infected with SASFIS.

PPA business model: SASFIS creators list a number of adult websites in the code of
the components downloaded by SASFIS variants. When a SASFIS-infected system
accesses any of these websites, it redirects to any of the listed adult websites.
