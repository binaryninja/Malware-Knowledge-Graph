For years, we have tracked the espionage threat actor we call Black Banshee (also known in
open source as Kimsuky). In 2019, it launched multiple parallel cyber espionage campaigns,
from large-scale credential harvesting to narrowly targeted espionage and exfiltration
operations.
The foundations for this activity began in August 2018, when we observed Black Banshee
setting up a substantial number of domains impersonating organisations across the
government, academia, and policy sectors. This formed the basis for multiple spear-phishing
and credential harvesting campaigns.
In tracking Black Banshee, we have identified a number of highly characteristic elements of
the threat actor’s tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In the two parts of this
retrospective look at Black Banshee’s 2019 activity, we will:

1/5

Examine the overlaps in Black Banshee’s infrastructure and modus operandi that have
allowed us to connect multiple strands of its operations more clearly than detailed so
far in open source;
Connect its 2019 campaigns, linking to activity dating back to late 2018; and,
Highlight how it has operated to achieve certain strategic objectives.

Tradecraft: most used domains and naming conventions
Infrastructure connections: IP addresses
Firstly, let us dive into Black Banshee’s mannerisms in setting up its infrastructure. Across
2019, it was possible to tie together different Black Banshee campaigns through the IP
addresses used. For example, on numerous occasions command and control domains for
Black Banshee malware resolved to IP addresses in following ranges - 185.224.137[.]0/23
and 185.224.138[.]0/23
The address 185.224.137[.]164, for one, has been used since at least December 2018 and
up to January 2020 to serve at least 24 malicious Black Banshee domains, including (but not
limited to):
user-daum-centre[.]pe[.]hu (from 2019-04-15 to 2019-05-21);
rrnaver[.]com (from 2019-08-21 to 2020-01-01); and,
nortice-centre[.]esy[.]es (from 2020-01-02 to 2020-01-28).
It also hosted, between June and November 2019, the domain kakao-check[.]esy[.]es, which
served as command and control (C2) for a sample of a new malware family that we call
MyDogs – a RAT thought to be unique to Black Banshee, and which was first reported on in
open source by AhnLab as part of its analysis on Operation Red Salt.1
Figure 1. 185.224.137[.]164 is an example of an IP that has hosted numerous Black
Banshee domains – associated with different campaigns – throughout 2019 and into 2020.
Some of these domains are shown here.

Infrastructure connections: domains
Among the domains used by Black Banshee, a few stood out for frequency across its
campaigns.
pe[.]hu - numerous subdomains on this domain were used in Operation Kabar Cobra,
Operation Kitty Phishing, and Operation WildCommand; additional subdomains were
listed in a Financial Security Institute VirusBulletin report detailing the tradecraft of
numerous operations attributed to Black Banshee;2

hol[.]es - subdomains on this domain were used for both the WildCommand cluster and
Operation MoneyHolic. Incidentally, some of the malware involved in Operation
MoneyHolic were samples of MyDogs malware, which was also used in Operation Red
Salt;
esy[.]es - subdomains on esy[.]es further strengthen the connections in infrastructure
setup between the WildCommand cluster and Operation MoneyHolic, as well as
overlaps with the infrastructure used for MyDogs malware used in Operation Red Salt;
and,
890m[.]com - subdomains on 890m[.]com were implicated in the WildCommand cluster,
as well as in activity using KONNI that had ties to Black Banshee3, and in other Black
Banshee activity.
While these domains are available for anyone to use, and not all of their subdomains are
malicious, Black Banshee used subdomains on these domains multiple times across different
operations. Other North Korea-based threat actors, especially APT37/Reaper, have also
made use of some of the same domains (such as hol[.]es4, 890m[.]com5) throughout 2019.

Banshee campaigns.

Infrastructure connections: naming
Even where the subdomains’ parent domain was not the same, our analysts noticed a
pattern of naming in adversary-registered infrastructure. We saw Black Banshee go down
three main routes for domain naming:
1. Naming highly specific to an organisation or institution being targeted or impersonated
(and often used for credential phishing);
2. Keywords referring to software used specifically in South Korea, often combined with
more generic, office- or enterprise-related themes; and,
3. Seemingly generic names, including ones impersonating email services, or domains
with similar or incremental numbering.
Black Banshee was also consistent in the setting up of command and control server-side
folders:
“/Est/up” and “/Est/down” were server-side paths seen in Operation Kabar Cobra,
Operation Kitty Phishing, and Operation WildCommand – folders to stage files
uploaded or downloaded by infected machines. We observed a similar server-side path
(http://nortice-centre[.]esy[.]es/down/) being referred to by a new sample of a Black
Banshee Windows Script File downloader first seen on 31 December 2019; this likely
indicates that the threat actor is maintaining a consistent approach to infrastructure
management and naming.

3/5

The server-side path “/bbs/data/temp” was observed in both Operation Kabar Cobra
and Operation Kitty Phishing.
Its parent path, “/bbs/data”, was observed in the context of Operation Red Salt, with
one of the sub-folders associated with malware that was later tied by ESTSecurity to
KONNI. Additionally, the same path was also observed on APT37/Reaper command
and control servers.6
Finally, “/bbs/filter” was present on a C2 for MyDogs malware related to Operation Red
Salt.

In Summary
In tracking North Korea-based threat actor Black Banshee (also known as Kimsuky), we
observed the threat actor display a series of infrastructure set-up habits. These included the
use of specific IP ranges to set up actor-controlled command and control domains, the
naming conventions used for such domains, and server-side folder names consistently
reused by Black Banshee across its C2s.
Such habits and TTPs effectively allowed us to connect multiple campaigns through direct
links and similarities in command and control infrastructure.
But that’s not all. Having connected multiple Black Banshee’s operations across 2019, we
observed that distinct “clusters” of activity appeared – groups of campaigns and operations
tied together by infrastructure links, similar tradecraft, shared indicators, and matching
targeting.
In an upcoming blog, we will detail the connections between campaigns found across these
clusters and offer strategic insight about their coherence in terms of TTPs and objectives.
