Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

Characteristics Unique to Targeted
Ransomware Attacks
• Attempt to break into various organizations and attack targets with weak security
measures and easy ransomware deployment
• Heavily use brute force when attacker cracks password
• Heavily use free tools when attacker dominates systems
• Use AD server’s group policies function (software installation and logon scripts)

• Ransomware type/version used by the attacker changes quickly
• Many overseas cases are similar to TTPs for targeted attacks (penetration test)

Fight Against Targeted Ransomware Incidents

37
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

Preparation
Prepare countermeasures and response plans from the following perspectives

1. Prevention
2. Detection and Initial containment

3. Response and Damage control
38
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

1. Prevention
• Implement countermeasures to prevent “Initial Access” “Dominance" and “Ransom" to increase
the cost of successful attacks
• Unlike targeted attacks, attacker aims organization with poor security.
Prevent “Initial Access"

Prevent “Dominance"

Prevent “Ransom"

• FW (Network, Personal,
Security Group for Cloud,
etc.)
• Vulnerability Management
for VPNs and Other Network
Devices
• E-Mail Security
• Anti-virus

• Network Segmentation and
Access Control
• Application whitelists, etc.
• Appropriate management of
Local and Domain
administrative accounts
• Domain Controller
Protection

• Appropriate data access
restrictions(Least privilege
principle)
• Acquire backup and store
Ransomware-safely
• Implement advanced
endpoint security which can
detect and protect against
file encryption

39
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

2. Detection and Initial containment
• In most incidents, existing security products can detect something signs of attacks.
• Unlike targeted attacks, attacks are less stealthy
• However, requires quick initial containment to minimize damage.
• Initial containment planning is essential for quick response.
Monitoring security alerts
• Anti-virus
• EDR
• Mail
• Malicious usage of
administrative accounts
• VPN

40
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

Identify threat type and severity

Initial containment planning

• Identify type of malware and
attack tools.
• Malicious Usage of highprivilege accounts
• Any activities related to
“Dominance"

• Isolation of affected computers
• Cut off corporate networks as a
precaution
• Cut off all Internet access as a
precaution
• Resetting passwords for all
administrative account as a
precaution

3. Response and Damage control
• Recovery plan is required to quickly recover encrypted data and minimize business impact.
• Just acquire backup is not enough for practical recovery
• Investigation, containment, and eradication processes must be planned in advance like targeted
attacks.

Recovery plan after encryption
• System Recovery Priority
• Recovery time objectives
• Prepare a cold standby system for most critical
systems
• Manpower and procedures for carrying out
restoration
41
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

“investigation" “containment" and "eradication"
plans
• Manpower, Operation, and Costs
• Target response time
• Targets to be achieved at each stage of incident
response process
• Preparation of specific tasks and procedures of
each stage of incident response process

Incident Response Process and Points
① Identification

② Initial containment

•Accurately recognize the
current situation from
security alerts and interviews

•Control and contain damage
that can be done in a short
time

42
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

③ Create specific
response plan

④ Investigation and
threat hunting

•Prepare a specific response
plan from investigation to
recovery, based on the
status of the incident.

•Identifying the root cause of
initial intrusion.
• Identifying TTPs of the
attack.
•Identification of hidden
affected computers.

⑦ Recovery

⑥ Eradication

⑤ Containment

•Recovering encrypted data.
•Recovering a Stopped
System Network
• Monitoring new attacks and
remaining threats.

•Eradicate all attacker
activities.
•Malware infected computers,
settings, etc.

•Contains attacker activities
based on investigation
results.

Balance between Business and Safety
• System recovery is often a priority because data encryption means business disruption
• In some cases, the previous incident response process cannot be performed step by step.
• A response plan that balances business continuity and safety needs to be developed within a
limited time frame

• What should be kept to a minimum to prevent the recurrence of attacks and the spread of
damage?

Examples of incidents and responses in Japan and overseas should be
widely shared with incident handlers, in order to create
best practices is especially important for quick, safe incident response and
minimize business Impact

Summary and Predictions for Targeted
Ransomware

49
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

Domestic Ransom(ware) in 2020
Initial access – following international cases
• Vulnerable devices (On-Premise/Cloud) will continue to be compromised directly from Internet
• Ransomware downloaded by other Malware which is spreading via e-mail (Emotet, etc.) is (will
be) increasing in Japan, same as overseas.
• Increasing ransomware incidents even in organizations which properly implement “Perimeter
Defense”

Dominance – close to targeted attack methods
• Use of RAT and penetration testing tools such as BloodHound and other APT like tools are
expected to increase in Japan.
• Use of RAT makes containment and eradication more difficult
• Attacker may repeatedly or continuously distribute ransomware using RAT in same
organization, even after security team recovers their encrypted data.
50
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

Domestic Ransom(ware) in 2020
Ransom – methods other than file encryption
• Attack on availability
• Attacker may find other ways to attack on availability other than encryption.
• Changing passwords for all domain accounts
• Interference with system operation by deleting files or changing settings on various servers
• Attack on confidentiality
• Attacker may threaten organization using confidential information they steal.
• Cases of obtaining confidential information, such as intellectual property, R & D
information, and personal information, and threatening in exchange for disclosure will
occur also in Japan
• Attack on integrity
• Secondary damage may occur about data integrity
• Obstruction of business by partial file wiping or encryption
51
Classification: //Secureworks/Public Use

Is It Wrong to Try to Find APT Techniques in
Ransomware Attack?
"Targeted"?
• Attackers aren't targeting specific organizations to encrypt or steal money.
• After widespread attacks, attacker target organizations with weak security
organizations that are likely to pay ransoms or have valuable information
• Although there are the same/similar methods as targeted attacks in terms of
each method, the overall attack flow is unique.
Ransom "ware"?
• Ransomware is just one way to make threats for money.
• Attacker don't have to use "Ransomware“ if there are another ways of
obtaining money.
• Don’t pay too much attention to ransom”ware”. It is important in incident
response to understand and prepare overall attack process.
