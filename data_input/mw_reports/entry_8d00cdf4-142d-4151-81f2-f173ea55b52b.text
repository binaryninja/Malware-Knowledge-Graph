ICS-CERT Annual Vulnerability Coordination Report 2016

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report summarizes the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)/
Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team’s (ICS-CERT) vulnerability coordination activities
for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 and Calendar Year (CY) 2016. NCCIC is a division of the Department of Homeland
Security’s (DHS) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C). ICS-CERT’s Vulnerability team
supports cybersecurity efforts across the industrial controls systems (ICS) community by working with its
partners to identify, validate, mitigate, and disclose ICS vulnerabilities. The information in this report provides
insight into vulnerability trends in 2016 and enhances visibility into ICS-CERT’s coordination efforts.
ICS-CERT received 2,282 reported vulnerabilities in FY 2016, which resulted in the release of 157
advisories and 17 alerts. In CY 2016, ICS-CERT received 2,328 reported vulnerabilities, which resulted in
the release of 185 advisories and 17 alerts. ICS-CERT analyzed a subset of the total number of vulnerabilities
reported in FY and CY 2016 and determined that the average Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
score for reported vulnerabilities was 7.8/10 and that the four most frequently occurring vulnerabilities
types were Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Input Validation, Cross-site Scripting, and Heap-based
Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities. In FY and CY 2016, ICS-CERT coordination with product vendors resulted
in product fixes for 92.1 percent and 89.3 percent of reported vulnerabilities, respectively. The majority
of the vulnerabilities coordinated by ICS-CERT in 2016 were most commonly associated with the Energy,
Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, and Water and Wastewater Systems Sectors.

1. SCOPE
This report provides a summary of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Cybersecurity
and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) / Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) vulnerability coordination efforts performed during Fiscal Year (FY) and Calendar Year
(CY) 2016. These coordination efforts apply to all of the 16 critical infrastructure (CI) sectors, as identified
in Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21).
ICS-CERT stood up the Vulnerability Coordination team in response to a recognized need for a single
resource to collect, coordinate, and provide vulnerability information to the industrial controls systems
(ICS) community. The primary objective of ICS-CERT’s vulnerability coordination work is to help mitigate
cybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly to reduce the likelihood of a successful cyber attack against the Nation’s
CI. Vulnerability coordination requires technical expertise, documentation, and close trusted partnerships
with key ICS community stakeholders, including vendors; manufacturers; integrators; CI owners;
researchers; federal, state, and local government organizations; and international partners.

2. ICS-CERT VULNERABILITY
COORDINATION PROCESS
ICS-CERT manages the vulnerability coordination process in five phases:

1. Vulnerability Identification: ICS-CERT typically obtains vulnerability information from security

researchers and product vendors and by monitoring public sources of vulnerability information. Once
ICS-CERT identifies a vulnerability, ICS-CERT reviews it and creates a vulnerability ticket.

2. Vendor Notification and Validation: ICS-CERT passes the identified vulnerability to the responsible vendor to validate it and to start the coordination process.

3. Vulnerability Mitigation: Following the validation of an identified vulnerability, ICS-CERT

provides recommendations and offers assistance while the affected vendor develops and implements a
mitigation plan.

4. Disclosure: In coordination with the reporting researcher and the product vendor, ICS-CERT

releases an information product to notify asset owners and operators about the identified vulnerability
and the proposed mitigations. If the vendor needs additional time to communicate with its customers
about product fixes, all involved parties negotiate a patch window. The patch window includes the
initial release of a portal advisory to the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) portal for a
predetermined length of time, prior to its public release.

5. Finalization: Following the publication of the ICS-CERT information product, the vulnerability
team adds any final details to the vulnerability ticket and closes it out.

3. VULNERABILITY METRICS
REPORTING CHANGES
The method used to collect and report vulnerability data changed in 2016 from that used in prior years. In
2016, ICS-CERT began reporting metrics data on vulnerability tickets closed within the FY or CY accounting
periods. This prevents reported metrics changing based on work accomplished throughout the life of
an open ticket. In previous year’s reporting methods, actions taken prior to ticket closure could result in
additional follow-on work being required, which in turn could change the reported metrics. It is therefore
important to note that some information reported in published alerts and advisories in 2016 may not be
included in the FY or CY data cited herein, since the associated vulnerability ticket may still be open. Data
for tickets will be included in the reporting period in which the ticket is closed.
ICS-CERT provides historical data in this document for the reader’s use; however, due to the data collection
and reporting changes in 2016, the reader should be cautious in comparing metrics from 2016 with
metrics from prior years.

4. INFORMATION PRODUCTS RELEASED
ICS-CERT releases alerts and advisories to notify the ICS community about vulnerabilities that threaten
the Nation’s CI. Alerts and advisories provide actionable information about known vulnerabilities, threats,
and mitigations. This information helps asset owners and operators understand how attackers might
compromise their ICS and how to take action to protect their ICS.
ICS-CERT alerts provide timely notification to CI owners and operators about publicly known threats that
have the potential to affect ICS. ICS-CERT typically releases alerts soon after the identification of publicly
available vulnerability information or exploits. Alerts also provide baseline mitigations to reduce the risk of
exploitation.
ICS-CERT advisories provide information about security vulnerabilities in products used in CI and typically
contain vendor recommended mitigations or compensating controls.

5. OPENED AND CLOSED TICKETS
When ICS-CERT receives a vulnerability report, the Vulnerability team opens (creates) a ticket to track the
vulnerabilities associated with the received report. Tickets include information that describes the problem,
tracks progress on active steps, maintains contact information, and annotates activities performed for closure.
Table 2 shows the total number of tickets opened and the total number of tickets closed during FY and
CY 2016.

6. REPORTED AND COORDINATED
VULNERABILITIES
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT coordinated 2,272 vulnerabilities. This number is significantly greater than the
number of vulnerabilities reported in prior years. The dramatic increase is primarily due to two vulnerability
reports containing hundreds of vulnerabilities, identified by using automated scanning tools.2 The scanning
tools expedite the detection process and make it easier to detect out-of-date third-party software.
Figure 3 shows the total number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT prior to FY 2016, as well as the
number of vulnerabilities coordinated by ICS-CERT in FY and CY 2016. The graphic does not include
calendar year data for years prior to 2016. With the metrics reporting change in 2016 to using closed
tickets, ICS-CERT advises caution when comparing data from FY 2016 with data from prior years.

Figure 3. Vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT since FY 2010.
To help provide more granularity to the FY and CY 2016 data, Table 3 breaks down the total number of
vulnerabilities coordinated. Out of the 2,282 reported vulnerabilities that ICS-CERT coordinated in FY 2016,
the responsible product vendors refuted 10 vulnerabilities, resulting in 2,272 validated vulnerabilities.
Excluding the 10 refuted vulnerabilities and the 1,878 outlier vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT performed data
analysis on 394 validated vulnerabilities. Of these 394 validated vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT did not assign a
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to four vulnerabilities.
The increase is primarily associated with two (2) tickets closed in 2016 that contain 1,418 and 460 vulnerabilities. Because
these 1,878 validated vulnerabilities were associated with a small subset of affected products, there is some concern that
these outliers could bias the metrics associated with vulnerability type and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
scores. As a result, these are included in the total number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT; however, this data is not
included in other metrics treated throughout this document.

ICS-CERT Annual Vulnerability Coordination Report 2016

In CY 2016, ICS-CERT received reports of 2,328 vulnerabilities. Of these, vendors refuted 11, resulting in
2,317 validated vulnerabilities. Excluding the 11 refuted vulnerabilities and the 1,878 outlier vulnerabilities
previously mentioned, ICS-CERT performed data analysis on 439 vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT did not assign
CVSS scores to eight of these 439 validated vulnerabilities. All vulnerability data for 2016 derives from
vulnerabilities associated with vulnerability tickets closed during the specified reporting period. Table 3
provides a breakdown of vulnerabilities coordinated by ICS-CERT in 2016.

7. VULNERABILITY TYPES AND SCORING
ICS-CERT categorizes and assesses the impact of validated vulnerabilities by assigning Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) numbers and CVSS scores. In the following subsections, we provide the metrics
associated with CWE and CVSS score assignments for validated vulnerabilities closed in CY and FY 2016.

7.1 Vulnerability Types
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT categorized and assigned 70 CWE numbers to 394 validated vulnerabilities. The four
most frequently occurring CWEs were CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow; CWE-20: Improper Input
Validation; CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting; and CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow.
In CY 2016, ICS-CERT categorized and assigned 85 CWE numbers to 439 validated vulnerabilities. The four
most frequently occurring CWEs were CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow; CWE-122: Heap-based
Buffer Overflow; CWE-20: Improper Input Validation; and CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting.
Figure 5 shows the most frequently assigned CWEs in FY and CY 2016. Each series shows the most frequent
CWE assignments for 70 percent of all validated vulnerabilities during that reporting period.

7.2 Vulnerability Impact Scoring
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT assigned CVSS scores to 390 validated vulnerabilities. In CY 2016, ICS-CERT assigned
CVSS scores to 431 validated vulnerabilities. The average CVSS score for the vulnerabilities assessed by
ICS-CERT was 7.8 out of 10. In FY and CY 2016, 71 and 73.8 percent of the vulnerabilities, respectively,
have CVSS scores of seven and above. A CVSS score of seven or above indicates that these vulnerabilities, if
exploited, have the potential to have a high or critical impact. Table 4 shows the distribution of the CVSS
scores and general statistics about the scoring.

Table 4. CVSS scores and statistics for FY and CY 2016.
One of the more significant parameters associated with CVSS scores is Attack Vector, based on accessibility.
This parameter gives some indication of the degree to which a vulnerability is exploitable. Of the 390
vulnerabilities assigned a CVSS score in FY 2016, 356 (91 percent) have an access vector of “Remote.”

8. VULNERABILITY RESOLUTION
ICS-CERT typically recommends that vendors produce product fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
However, in some cases, it may not be possible for a vendor to offer a fix for unsupported products. In
these situations, ICS-CERT works with the vendor to identify compensating controls to limit the risk of
exploitation of an identified vulnerability.
Many of the researchers that ICS-CERT works with use tools and techniques that are not readily available to
some vendors. Therefore, during the vulnerability coordination process, ICS-CERT recommends that vendors
provide copies of their product fixes to the researchers who identified the associated vulnerabilities so they
can validate the fix by using the same technique(s) they used to find the vulnerability originally.
In an attempt to capture vendor responsiveness to addressing reported vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT details the
number of vulnerabilities for which product vendors have provided product fixes, as well as the number of
researcher-validated fixes. Table 6 provides the FY an CY 2016 data for closed tickets.

9. VULNERABILITY REPORTING TRENDS
In 2016, ICS-CERT received vulnerabilities from security researchers and product vendors. ICS-CERT
observed an increase in the number of product vendors self-reporting vulnerabilities, which is a strong
indicator of a mature or maturing security culture within an organization. To better understand and track
this trend, ICS-CERT has broken down all of the validated vulnerabilities by reporting source for FY and
CY 2016 in Table 7. Table 8 shows the researchers/non-vendor organizations and vendors who reported
vulnerabilities for FY and CY 2016.

11. SUMMARY
In FY and CY 2016, ICS-CERT released 157 and 185 advisories, respectively, and 17 alerts during both
reporting periods. The number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT in FY and CY 2016 were 2,282
and 2,328 vulnerabilities, respectively. The Vulnerability team performed a more detailed analysis on a
subset of the reported vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity researchers reported 98.6 percent of the vulnerabilities
reported to ICS-CERT and product vendors self-reported the remaining 1.4 percent. The most frequently
occurring vulnerability types encountered by ICS-CERT were Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Input
Validation, Cross-site Scripting, and Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities. The average CVSS score for
the vulnerabilities assessed by ICS-CERT was 7.8 out of 10. In FY and CY 2016, 71 and 73.8 percent of the
vulnerabilities, respectively, have CVSS scores of seven and above. A CVSS score of seven or above indicates
that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, have the potential to have a high or critical impact.
In FY and CY 2016, ICS-CERT coordinated product vulnerabilities with product vendors that provided
product fixes for 363 and 392 vulnerabilities, respectively, which correspond to product fixes for 92.1
percent and 89.3 percent of the vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT. The majority of the vulnerabilities
coordinated by ICS-CERT in 2016 were most commonly associated with the Energy, Critical Manufacturing,
Commercial Facilities, Water and Wastewater Systems Sectors.
