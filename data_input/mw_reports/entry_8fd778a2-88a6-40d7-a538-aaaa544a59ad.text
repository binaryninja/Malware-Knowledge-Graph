Threat Advisory Threats

Emotet resumed spamming operations on March 7, 2023, after a months-long hiatus.
Initially leveraging heavily padded Microsoft Word documents to attempt to evade
sandbox analysis and endpoint protection, the botnets switched to distributing
malicious OneNote documents on March 16.
Since returning, Emotet has leveraged several distinct infection chains, indicating that
they are modifying their approach based on their perceived success in infecting new
systems.
The initial emails delivered to victims are consistent with what has been observed
from Emotet over the past several years.

Initial campaign
Following its initial return to spamming operations, Emotet was leveraging heavily padded
Microsoft Word documents in an attempt to evade detection. By leveraging a large number
of inconsequential bytes in their documents, they could increase the size of the documents

to surpass the maximum file size restrictions that automated analysis platforms like
sandboxes and anti-virus scanning engines enforce.
The initial emails were consistent with what has been commonly observed from Emotet in
recent years. They typically contained an attached ZIP archive containing a Microsoft Word
document. An example of one such email is shown below.

While the ZIP archives are often small, in some cases only ~646KB, the Microsoft Word
document when fully extracted was ~500MB in size.

The document included a large number of 0x00 bytes, a technique commonly referred to as
“padding.”

Some of the documents also featured excerpts from the classic novel “Moby Dick,” another
attempt to increase the size of the documents for evasion purposes.

The Office documents featured templates consistent with those used by Emotet in the past,
as shown below.

The Word documents in this campaign contained malicious VBA macros that, when
executed, functioned as a malware downloader, retrieving the Emotet payload from
attacker-controlled distribution servers and infecting systems, thus adding them to the
Emotet botnets.

Emotet shifts to OneNote
Microsoft recently deployed new security mechanisms around protecting endpoints from
macro-based malware infections, which resulted in various threat actors moving away from
Office document-based malspam campaigns. In many cases, these malware distribution
campaigns switched to distributing OneNote documents instead, likely as a result of
decreased infections and lower success rates. Emotet is no different — shortly after their
return to spamming operations on March 16, 2023, they began distributing OneNote files,
as well.
In one example, the sender purported to be from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
and requested that the recipient complete the attached form.

The attached OneNote document featured templates similar to what has been observed in
other Office document formats over the past several years, prompting the user to click
inside the document to view the file.

When clicked, an embedded WSF script linked behind the view button containing malicious
VBScript code is executed.

This VBScript downloader is responsible for retrieving the Emotet malware payload from an
attacker-controlled server and infecting the system.

More recently, the embedded object inside of the OneNote files contained JavaScript
instead of VBScript but offered the same functionality within the infection chain.

Hovering over the next button indicates that an object called “Object1.js” will execute when
the button is clicked. This is because the attacker has embedded a clickable object behind
the lure image as shown below.

This object is a heavily obfuscated JavaScript downloader responsible for retrieving and
executing the Emotet payload on the system. A snippet from the obfuscated downloader is
shown below.

In a relatively short period, Emotet has modified its infection chain several times to
maximize the likelihood of successfully infecting victims.
