The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s lives has been significant, be it
on health, livelihood or work life. This has proven advantageous for the threat actors who
have begun to look for vulnerabilities, especially, in remote access services, thereby
exploiting the Work From Home situation of the general public. The pandemic has also
created enormous opportunities for n00b malware authors, especially with the Malware-asa-Service (MaaS) business model taking shape in the cybercrime world.
Nowadays, social media applications are being used for interacting within the cybersec
community and keeping oneself updated. Some of the most prevalent social media apps
are Telegram and Discord. In this pandemic time, we found lots of channels being created
in Telegram and Discord that share malware and hacking tools which pose a threat to the
users. We, the Threat Intelligence Team at K7 Labs have been monitoring hacker forums
and these kinds of social media applications for possible threats. While monitoring, we
noticed a builder version of BlackNET tool being shared in the channel (as shown in Figure
1) and on the same day we also noticed a compiled version of BlackNET RAT in the wild.
BlackNET caught our attention because it was advertised as a RAT with strong lateral
movement capabilities.

This BlackNET RAT is not new; there are already a few blogs on the same which have
been posted publicly like “c0d3inj3cT”, “Malwarebytes” , however, this tool is still being
updated and the latest version is BlackNet v3.7 which is freely available on GitHub and the
developer calls himself “BlackHacker511”.
This is part 1 of our blog on BlackNET RAT that discusses how the compiled malicious
executable from this tool propagates via USB, Dropbox including its Anti-Analyzing, AntiVM, keylogging and Remote Desktop functionalities. Other interesting techniques used by
this malware will be discussed in detail in our upcoming blog posts.
BlackNET RAT is a Remote Access Trojan that adds devices to the BlackNET botnet. It is
a free, advanced and modern Windows botnet with a secure PHP panel built using
VB.NET. This botnet controller comes with a lot of features such as:
Keylogger
Password Stealer
Stealing Browser History and Cookies
Executing Shell Command
Uninstalling Client
USB spread and Dropbox spread
Bitcoin wallets

2/10

Important point to be noted is that the developers of this tool update the RAT quite
frequently with newer functionalities.
This tool’s compiled executable output mimics the file version of legitimate svchost.exe so
as to operate covertly. This malevolent executable is also equipped with Anti-debugging
and Anti-VM features that complicates the reversing process.
This malware uses multiple techniques such as Anti-detection, DDOS attack, Keylogger,
Remote Desktop, Watchdog, USB spread, Dropbox spread and also persistence
techniques as shown in Figure 2.

techniques used
Anti-Analyzing
This malware carries a predefined list of tool names which are typically used by a malware
researcher to monitor a malware’s behaviour (as shown in Figure 3). The malware checks
whether any of the tools from the predefined list is running in the victim’s system by
fetching the active process names using GETPROCESSESBYNAME method and kills the
process which are matching in the list. The malware also looks for the main window name
of the open windows in the system by using PROCESS.MAINWINDOWTITLE method and
compares it with the predefined list of malware analysing tools names as shown in Figure
3.

Predefined list of malware analysis tool names
Anti-VM Technique
This malware verifies if it is running within a controlled virtual environment by checking for
specific dll names like “vmguestlib.dll” for VmWare, “vboxmrxnp.dll” for Virtual Box and
by using LoadLibrary API it loads “sbiedll.dll” to check whether the dll is available inside
the system to detect Sandboxie VMs (as shown in Figure 4). Once a virtual environment is
detected, the malware uses cmd.exe to self delete and exit the environment.

Keylogger
The BlackNET RAT developer uses LimeLogger code for logging the key strokes. Since
these developers are genuine, they have mentioned the use of LimeLogger code in their
builder file, and have given credits to the creator on their GitHub page as shown in Figure
5.

Using HookCallback function and KeyboardLayout function they collect all the keystrokes
and store them in a text file under temp folder as shown in Figure 6 and it also stores sent
information from malware and receives information from C&C server in the same log file.

Figure 6: LimeLogger Code
In the HookCallback function, the threat actor have used the GetKeyState API to capture
the keystrokes and call the KeyboardLayout function. Here MapVirtualKey API is used to
translate the captured virtual key into scan code and ToUnicodeEx API is used to convert
scan code to character and stores it in a buffer. Then it returns the key character and
writes it in the log file as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.

Remote Desktop
6/10

The main feature for this malware is to capture screenshots of the victim’s system screen
and send it to the current host domain “hxxp[:]//redbulllogistics[.]online/blackie“ which
has been pre-defined in its Form1 function as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9:

Domain name used by attacker
The domain “hxxp[:]//redbulllogistics[.]online/blackie” was registered on June 18, 2020 and
updated on Dec 5, 2020 which was the day this client malware file was detected in the
wild.
The remote desktop function takes screenshots using Graphics.CopyFromScreen
function. Then it saves the file as company.png in the temp folder and uploads the files to
“hxxp[:]//redbulllogistics[.]online/blackie/upload.php?id=” using socket.uploadfile
function as shown in Figure 10.

The attacker uses mutex in this malware to check whether the file is already running in the
system, mutex value used by this malware is “BN[GRLdNjTe-8793677]”.
Dropbox Spread
The latest feature of BlackNET malware is Dropbox spread, a cloud storage provider. Here
the attacker penetrates into the userprofile and creates a folder name as dropbox under
the victim’s user profile. Then it drops the malware and changes the malware file’s name to
“Adobe Photoshop CS.exe” as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11: Dropbox spread
USB Spread
This is the most important feature available on this BlackNET RAT where it also shows
worm behaviour. Initially, when the malware is installed, it also checks whether the USB
Drive is mounted or not. With that information, the attacker sends instruction via the C&C
server to spread through removable drives. In Figure 12, we can see that if an external
drive is available, it checks for availability of free space and whether it is a removable drive
or CD-ROM. Then it copies the malware to the removable drive with a link file for the
malware with a default text icon and re-names it as “Windows_update.exe” with a hidden
attribute.

Figure 12: Copying the malware to the removable Drive
To create lnk file in a removable drive it calls lnk function as shown in Figure 13. The
malware first deletes the old file with lnk extensions and using wscript.shell creates a new
lnk file and using cmd.exe it executes inside the drive to infect another system which uses
this removable drive. Through this method it propagates to different systems.

Figure 13: Creating lnk File on Removable Drive
In the upcoming blog we will be discussing how the attacker sends instructions to the
botnet along with how the client file is updated with newer functionalities and the
malware’s persistence techniques to stay stealthy. Next blog post also throws light on
other malicious behaviour of the BlackNET RAT like disabling windows defender,
password stealing, stealing browser cookies and XMR Mining.
