“Lockbit Black” actively targeting BFSI Sector
LockBit ransomware is currently one of the most popular and active ransomware groups in the wild.
This ransomware variant was first detected in September 2019 and used by Threat Actors (TAs) to
target multiple sectors and organizations worldwide. The TAs behind LockBit operate under the
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model.
In the figure below, we have prepared a breakdown of the industries targeted by the LockBit
ransomware. As per our investigation, we determine that over 1/3rd of the ransomware gang’s victims
are from the BFSI sector, followed by the Professional Services sector.

In August 2021, LockBit 2.0 ransomware was analyzed by Cyble Research Labs. In March 2022, the
TAs behind LockBit announced that LockBit 3.0 would be released shortly. Last week, the TAs updated
their leak site with information about their latest version and its features (shown below).

While searching for the latest LockBit 3.0 sample, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post
wherein a researcher mentioned that a new version of ransomware named “LockBit 3.0” (also referred
to as “LockBit Black”) is now active in the wild.
LockBit 3.0 encrypts files on the victim’s machine and appends the extension of encrypted
files as “HLJkNskOq.”

LockBit ransomware requires a key from the command-line argument “-pass” to execute. The below
figure shows the process chain of the LockBit ransomware file.

Technical Analysis
The sample hash (SHA256),
80e8defa5377018b093b5b90de0f2957f7062144c83a09a56bba1fe4eda932cewas taken for this
analysis.
Based on static analysis, we identified that the ransomware is encrypted and decrypts the strings and
code during runtime.
The ransomware resolves its API functions dynamically, as shown below.

After that, it creates a mutex to ensure that only one instance of malware is running on the victim’s
system at any given time.
The malware exits if the mutex is already present. The below figure shows the created mutex name.

Figure 5 – Mutex Creation
The ransomware creates multiple threads using the CreateThread() API to perform several tasks in
parallel for faster file encryption, as shown in Figure 6.
Each thread is responsible for querying system information, getting drive details, ransom note creation,
getting file attributes, deleting services, file search, encryption, etc.

6 – Multiple Thread Creation
Before encrypting the files, the ransomware uses the WMI query to enumerate Volume Shadow copies
using the command “select * from Win32_ShadowCopy”.
It then deletes the copies using “Win32_ShadowCopy.ID,” as shown in Figure 7.
The ransomware performs this operation to prevent any attempts at system restoration after encrypting
the files.

Figure 7 – Delete ShadowCopy
LockBit 3.0 ransomware deletes a few services to encrypt the files successfully. To delete these
services, the ransomware calls the OpenSCManagerA()API to get the service control manager
database access.
After gaining access, the ransomware enumerates the services and fetches the service names from the
victim’s machine.
It then checks for the presence of these services and deletes them if they are actively running on the
victim’s machine. The below image shows the list of some service names targeted by ransomware.

After deleting the services, the ransomware drops two files named “HLJkNskOq.ico” and
“HLJkNskOq.bmp” in the %programdata% location.
The ransomware creates a “DefaultIcon” registry key for the extension “HLJkNskOq” shown in the
figure below.This operation changes the icons of the encrypted files, which have the extension
“HLJkNskOq.”

Figure 9 – Registry Modification of Default Icon
Before initiating the encryption process, the ransomware drops the below ransom note in multiple
folders with the file name “HLJkNskOq.README.txt.”

The ransomware then encrypts the victim’s files, appends the extension “.HLJkNskOq,” and changes
the file’s icon as shown below.

Finally, the ransomware changes the victim’s wallpaper leveraging the file “HLJkNskOq.bmp” using the
systemparametersinfoW() API function.

In the dropped ransom note, victims are instructed on how to pay the ransom to decrypt their encrypted
files. Additionally, the TAs threaten the victims stating that their personal data will be posted on their
leak site if the ransom is not paid within the specified window.

After visiting the TOR link mentioned in the ransom note, it opens the TA’s leak site page, which is
updated with new features containing a Twitter icon to search for posts related to this ransomware on
Twitter.
Additionally, TAs created a link on their leak site, redirecting users to a page where they have
announced the Bug Bounty program. This program invites all
security researchers/ethical and unethical hackers to find flaws in their ransomware project to make it
bug-free and more stable.

The affiliate rules page of the leak site includes ransomware functionalities and affiliate program details,
which support languages such as English, Chinese, Spanish, etc.
The TAs behind LockBit 3.0 suggest that their victims buy Bitcoin using the payment options shown in
the figure below.

The figure below shows the chat option on the leak site for communication with the TAs. Also, the “Trial
Decrypt” option is available to victims to test an encrypted file’s decryption.

Conclusion

9/11

Ransomware is becoming an increasingly common and effective attack method to target organizations
and adversely impact their productivity.
LockBit 3.0 is a highly sophisticated form of ransomware that uses various techniques to conduct its
operations. Cyble will closely monitor the campaign and continue to update our readers with the latest
information on ransomware.
