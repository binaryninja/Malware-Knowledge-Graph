TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)
(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order declaring a national
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by specified harmful foreign activities
of the Government of the Russian Federation.
I have determined that specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian
Federation — in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic
elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; to
engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its
allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign
governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to
undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and
1/2

to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial
integrity of states — constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
