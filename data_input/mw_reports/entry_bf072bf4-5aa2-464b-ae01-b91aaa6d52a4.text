Why Use a Framework to Organize Threat Intel?
Regardless of which one you choose, it can help you…

§ Identify where you have gaps in knowledge
§ Compare adversaries to each other
§ Compare adversary behavior to defenses

FIN7
Introduction

§ Active since late 2015
§ Financially motivated
§ Primary objective: point of sale compromise
§ Mainly use spearphishing for malware distribution
§ Limited use of exploits, and no known use of zeroday exploits

§ Blend of publicly available and unique or altered
tools

Spearphishing
T1193: Spearphishing
§ Targeted spearphishing with customized lures ATT&CK
with attachment
– Weaponized Word documents with malicious VBA macros T1064: Scripting
– LNK files used to launch VBA code embedded within document contents
– Embedded OLE objects containing malware T1173: Dynamic Data Exchange

§ Use social engineering to encourage response
T1204: User execution

©2018 FireEye ©2018 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited 18-1528-22.

Spearphishing: Mitigation and Detection
§ User training
– Even if they click, will they report?
– Don’t rely just on this

§ Tools: email filtering and application whitelisting
§ Use GPO to block execution of macros in documents from the Internet
§ Create analytics on suspicious execution chains to detect macros
– Example: winword.exe spawning cmd.exe, wscript.exe, or powershell.exe

HALFBAKED
§ The HALFBAKED malware has several components:
§ A dropper contained in a VBA Macro which writes out the installer and backdoor

to the infected system

T1064: Scripting

§ A VBScript installer which installs the backdoor as a persistent service
§ A VBScript backdoor possessing typical capabilities:

– Reverse shell

T1050: New Service

T1059: Command-Line Interface

– Execute shell commands

– Upload and download files T1105: Remote File Copy
– Uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to collect reconnaissance details

T1047: WMI
©2018 FireEye ©2018 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited 18-1528-22.

HALFBAKED: Detection and Mitigation
§ Implement least-privilege model for domain users
– Ensure domain users are not in local admins group

§ Monitor service creation through command-line invocation and look for low
frequency services in your environment

§ Monitor network traffic for WMI connections and capture command-line
arguments of "wmic”

– Look for anomalies in systems using WMI

14

BELLHOP
§ BELLHOP is a javascript-based backdoor interpreted using the native Windows
Scripting Host (WSH)

T1082: System Information Discovery
– The BELLHOP dropper gathers basic host information and downloads a base64encoded blob of javascript to disk and sets up persistence in three ways:
§ Creating a Run key in the Registry

T1060: Registry Run Keys

§ Creating a RunOnce key in the Registry
§ Creating a persistent named scheduled task T1053: Scheduled Task

– BELLHOP communicates using HTTP and HTTPS with primarily benign sites such as
Google documents and Pastebin T1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol
T1102: Web Service

©2018 FireEye ©2018 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited 18-1528-22.

BELLHOP: Mitigation and Detection
§ Monitor for ver, systeminfo, and dir executed from the command line
– Create a detection that chain these with other discovery commands

§ Monitor for Registry run keys that do not correlate with known software
§ Limit privileges of user accounts so only authorized admins can create scheduled
tasks on remote systems

§ Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling
"Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" in event logging
– Example BELLHOP Scheduled Task: SysChecks

POWERSOURCE & TEXTMATE
§ POWERSOURCE is a heavily obfuscated and modified version of the publicly
available tool DNS_TXT_Pwnage T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information
T1060: Registry Run Keys
§ Installed in the registry or Alternate Data Streams
T1096: NTFS File Attributes
§ Uses DNS TXT requests (port 53) for command and control

T1071: Standard App Layer Protocol

T1043: Commonly Used Port

§ TEXTMATE has been observed being downloaded via POWERSOURCE
§ Second-stage “file-less” payload, runs in memory via PowerShell

T1086: PowerShell

§ Implements reverse shell via DNS TXT (port 53) commands

T1059: Command-Line Interface

T1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol
©2018 FireEye ©2018 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited 18-1528-22.
T1043: Commonly Used Port

POWERSOURCE & TEXTMATE: Mitigation and Detection
§ Force web traffic through a proxy
– Including DNS traffic – do not allow Internet DNS resolution

§ Flag and analyze commands containing indicators of obfuscation and known
suspicious syntax such as uninterpreted escape characters like ^ and “

§ Restrict PowerShell execution policy to administrators and to only execute signed
scripts

PowerAdmin Exec (PAExec)
§ PowerAdmin Exec (PAExec)
– Functionally similar to SysInternals PsExec, PAExec supports execution of remote
commands
T1035: Service Execution

– Most forensic artifacts are created on the source and not the target

©2018 FireEye ©2018 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited 18-1528-22.

PAExec: Mitigation and Detection
§ Look for unusual file names such as “logsXXX.exe” (unique to FIN7)
§ Monitor for unusual executables running from “C:\Windows\Temp\”
§ If you have technology capable of it, look at binaries for:
– CompanyName

Power Admin LLC

– FileDescription

PAExec Application

– InternalName

PAExec

– OriginalFilename

PAExec.exe

PILLOWMINT
§ PILLOWMINT is a Point-of-Sale malware tool used to scrape track 1 and track 2
payment card data from memory

– Scraped payment card data is encrypted and stored in the registry and as
plaintext in a file
T1074: Data Staged
– Contains additional backdoor capabilities including:
§ Running processes
§ Downloading and executing files T1105: Remote File Copy
§ Downloading and injecting DLLs

T1055: Process Injection

– Communicates with a command and control (C2) server over HTTP using AES
encrypted messages
T1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol

T1032: Standard Cryptographic Protocol

©2018 FireEye ©2018 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited 18-1528-22.

PILLOWMINT: Mitigation and Detection
§ Implement point-to-point encryption and tokenization
§ Use data loss prevention software
§ Look for registry keys:
– HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\server
– HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\com
man
– HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\PDSK
21_<random>

§ Look for output files in the directory: %WINDIR%\system32\sysvols\

Conclusion
§ Frameworks are useful for organizing threat intel regardless of which one
§ Consider which framework based on your use case, and consider combining
them for analysis

§ FIN7 has been successful because they use social engineering and well-disguised
lures

§ FIN7 continues to be successful because they are constantly adapting and
evolving to prevent detection

§ For the best chance of detecting FIN7, look across their attack lifecycle and
ATT&CK techniques they use
