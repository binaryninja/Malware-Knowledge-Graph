Back in February, we noted the similarities between the
Patchwork and Confucius groups and found that, in addition to
the similarities in their malware code, both groups primarily went
after targets in South Asia. During the months that followed in
which we tracked Confucius’ activities, we found that they were
still aiming for Pakistani targets.

Security Predictions for 2018

During their previous campaign, we found Confucius using fake
romance websites to entice victims into installing malicious
Android applications. This time, the threat actor seems to have
a new modus operandi, setting up two new websites and new payloads with which to compromise
its targets.
Fake Android porn app and Windows chat applications as lures

Attackers are banking on network
vulnerabilities and inherent weaknesses
to facilitate massive malware attacks,

The first website uses adult content as a lure, via an Android application called Fuddi Duniya,
which links to a website that displays nude pictures every day. The app’s APK is linked directly
from the homepage, with a disclaimer stating that Google Play does not allow pornography in their
store.

IoT hacks, and operational disruptions.
The ever-shifting threats and increasingly
expanding attack surface will challenge
users and enterprises to catch up with
their security.
Read our security predictions for 2018.

Business Process Compromise

Figure 1: fake website with a link to download the Fuddi Duniya app. The displayed Urdu text
could be translated as “Real women, girls, and housewives || Download the app now More than
thousands of women app.”

Attackers are starting to invest in longterm operations that target specific
processes enterprises rely on. They
scout for vulnerable practices,
susceptible systems and operational
loopholes that they can leverage or
abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101:
Business Process Compromise.

The app’s features are similar to the previous malicious Android application, such as having the
ability to record audio and steal SMS, accounts, contacts and certain file types from specific
directories. In addition, the application now retrieves the last known location and uses the
development platform Google Firebase to upload the stolen content.

The second fake website is again related to chat, with a background suggesting that it can help
find users a partner. Initially, a link to a malicious Android application hosted on Google Play that
shared the same features as the application described above was present. But after we reached
out to Google while carrying out the research, the application was removed from the store and the

Same as with the fake Tweety chat application we described in detail in our previous research, a
Windows application with real chat features based on the open-source chat application
RocketChat was offered. Similarly, this application also comes bundled with malicious .NET code.
While small and relatively simple, we found this malicious application interesting to analyze as it
revealed the countries targeted by the threat actor. The application is a simple downloader that
sends some basic information (username, antivirus, IP address, and operating system version)
encrypted using triple Data Encryption Standard (DES).

Figure 4. Sample of the app’s code
Periodically, the malware tries to contact the Command-and-Control (C&C) server with the
username encoded into parameters. Based on the information they retrieve, the operators can
then decide to instruct the malware to download the second stage payload. This function is similar
to the various versions of backdoors (such as sctrls and sip_telephone) that we analyzed in our
previous blog post and whitepaper.
An interesting feature of the downloader: It uses an online service to retrieve the victim’s IP
address and country, which it compares with a list of allowed countries. If the victim seemingly
comes from a different country, the program will self-delete and quit. This list contains:
Most of the South and Southeast Asian countries (including Mongolia)
Most of the Middle Eastern countries
Most of the African countries
Only Ukraine in Europe
Only Trinidad and Tobago in the Americas

No country from Oceania

Figure 5. Excerpt of the valid country list
We noted that it does both client-side and server-side IP filtering, showing that the attacker has
improved its infrastructure. At the end of last year, a C&C from the same threat actor was not only
accessible from any IP address, but it was possible to browse the server directory tree without
authentication.
After impersonating a fake victim of interest, we obtained a second stage payload (Detected as
TROJ_DELF.XXWZ), which is a filestealer based on the Delphi programming language similar to
the “svctrls” malware described in our previous blogpost. This one is called “sysctrls” and it looks
for files with the following extensions:

It then sends them via a POST HTTP request to windefendr[.]com/description.php.
Further analysis of this filestealer revealed interesting links with other threat actor groups.
The Delphi Link
We already mentioned that Confucius had possible links to other groups in our previous blog post,
which mentioned code sharing between Patchwork and Confucius. Both groups used a backdoor
with the same configuration file structure and commands.
We found more code shared among the two threat actor’s malware, as Patchwork recently used
multiple Delphi malware similar to some of the Delphi malware we described before.
We initially spotted some visual similarities between the malware used. Although no forms are
displayed while the malware is running, we can see its TForm object in the Delphi decompiler. The
TForm object often has two TTimer objects — but sometimes we have seen one or even three of
these objects — usually with random names. Occasionally, listboxes with encrypted strings are
also added.

While looking into any of the TTimers’ OnTimer methods, we often found a certain kind of
structure: A pointer to an encrypted string stored in an EDX register followed by the call to the
decryption function.

Figure 8: Calling the decryption function
This encouraged us to analyze the string encryption routines thoroughly.
Our analysis revealed three of them. The first involves a very simple routine that flips every bit of
the string. The second algorithm involves a hardcoded key, which is transformed by taking the five
lower bits of each character, and then used as a XOR key. In some cases, the key is split in half in
the binary, so it is first reunited before being used. Finally, our third algorithm uses a 94-character
substitution table. This algorithm was previously discussed by security researchers in a Confuciusrelated blog post.
For each of these routines, we found a recent sample going back to a domain name belonging to
Patchwork’s infrastructure.
The substitution tables of the third algorithm were randomly generated at build time, while the
attacker seemingly set the keys used in the second algorithm. We found six different keys in the
latter category that were different for the Patchwork and Confucius group.

Interestingly, one of those keys, “xldbszcd”, was found in a file stealer used by Confucius
(472ea4929c5e0fb4e29597311ed90a14c57bc67fbf26f81a3aac042aa3dccb55, Detected as
TSPY_CONFSTEAL.A) as well as in two other file stealers.
One file stealer (cca74bb322ad7833a21209b1418c9837e30983daec30d199a839f46075ee72f2,
Detected as TSPY_DELF.SUW) published by security researchers in 2013 and linked to the
domain myflatnet[.]com, was attributed by several parties to the Hangover group.
The other file stealer
(1f0dabd61947b6df8a392b77a0eae33777be3caad13698aecc223b54ab4b859a, Detected as
TROJ_DELF.XXWZ) is related to a domain reported in September 2016. That report also
mentioned InPage software targeting and Delphi backdoors.

Figure 10. Left: Confucius group, Middle: Hangover group, Right: Unnamed group
After some research, we found multiple Delphi backdoors that used any of the three decryption
routines. The backdoors also linked to an infrastructure matching old Hangover domains as well as
the infrastructure of domains from the September 2016 blog post. Some of these samples were
several years old and had left the original name of the bit-flip decryption algorithm, which was
“EnDecrypt”. This algorithm matches the following code snippet.
Patchwork’s Ongoing Campaigns
Aside from their Delphi malware, Patchwork is still active. Lately, they have been sending multiple
RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8570. The dropped payloads are modified versions of the Remote
Administration Tool QuasarRAT that can be traced to the domains sastind-cn[.]org and
tautiaos[.]com.

The attackers sometimes design the weaponized documents to look like legitimate documents of

interest to the target. The documents are also unusually large — often more than 10 megabytes.

CSBA. Note that the weaponized document was crafted to look like it came from CSBA but does
not imply that CSBA or its related assets have been compromised
The group still uses the Badnews malware, a backdoor with information-stealing and file-executing
capabilities, albeit updated with a slight modification in the encryption routine at the end of 2017,
when they added Blowfish encryption on top of their custom encryption described in our former
Patchwork blogpost.
Defending against Confucius and Patchwork
Threat actors like Confucius and Patchwork are known for their large arsenal of tools and everevolving techniques that can render traditional security solutions — which are often not designed
to handle the persistent and sophisticated threats detailed in this blog — ineffective. To help
combat these kinds of threats organizations will need to take a more proactive and focused
security posture that can cover the most ground in terms of security. Some specific security
measures organizations can implement:
Convert w ebpages or entire w ebsites to PDF - PDFmyURL!

Recognize social engineering attempts. Malicious mobile apps are common infection vectors
for cybercriminals, as they can attract specific target audiences. In this case, Confucius went
with the common adage “sex sells”
Proactively monitor the organization’s network. Threat actors are notorious for creating
stealthy malware that can bypass superficial network monitoring. A more proactive stance that
includes proper application of firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems can
help mitigate the impact of an attack
Implement network segmentation. Even with the best security technology, there is still a
chance of an attack slipping through. Separating the network into individual parts, as well as
restricting access to only those who really need it, can mitigate the damage that occurs in
case of a successful attack.
Update systems regularly. Everything from endpoints to network software to IoT devices
should be patched and updated to prevent or minimize the chance of a threat actor exploiting
a vulnerability
In an ideal scenario, an organization’s in-house security team implement all of these and other
security measures. The reality is that IT departments of small to large-sized organizations are not
equipped to handle the more advanced threats that groups like Confucius use in their attacks.
Since these teams also handle the day-to-day IT requirements of the organization, taking on a
more involved and proactive stance may not be easy. In this case, an organization can look into
third party security providers who can handle specialized work, such as root cause analysis and
detailed research, and also provide a remediation plan that gives organizations a better chance
against advanced threats.
