Threat Analysis Group

Major events like elections and COVID-19 present opportunities for threat actors, and
Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) is working to thwart these threats and protect our
products and the people using them. As we head into the U.S. election, we wanted to share
1/8

an update on what we’re seeing and how threat actors are changing their tactics.

What we’re seeing around the U.S. elections
In June, we announced that we saw phishing attempts against the personal email accounts
of staffers on the Biden and Trump campaigns by Chinese and Iranian APTs (Advanced
Persistent Threats) respectively. We haven’t seen any evidence of such attempts being
successful.

The Iranian attacker group (APT35) and the Chinese attacker group (APT31) targeted
campaign staffers’ personal emails with credential phishing emails and emails containing
tracking links. As part of our wider tracking of APT31 activity, we've also seen them deploy
targeted malware campaigns.

One APT31 campaign was based on emailing links that would ultimately download malware
hosted on GitHub. The malware was a python-based implant using Dropbox for command
and control. It would allow the attacker to upload and download files as well as execute
arbitrary commands. Every malicious piece of this attack was hosted on legitimate services,
making it harder for defenders to rely on network signals for detection.

In one example, attackers impersonated McAfee. The targets would be prompted to install a
legitimate version of McAfee anti-virus software from GitHub, while malware was
simultaneously silently installed to the system.

When we detect that a user is the target of a government-backed attack, we send them a
prominent warning. In these cases, we also shared our findings with the campaigns and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. This targeting is consistent with what others have
subsequently reported.

Overall, we’ve seen increased attention on the threats posed by APTs in the context of the
U.S. election. U.S government agencies have warned about different threat actors, and
we’ve worked closely with those agencies and others in the tech industry to share leads and
intelligence about what we’re seeing across the ecosystem. This has resulted in action on
our platforms, as well as others. Shortly after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Ukrainian
Parliament member Andrii Derkach for attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process, we
removed 14 Google accounts that were linked to him.

Coordinated influence operations
We’ve been sharing actions against coordinated influence operations in our quarterly TAG
bulletin (check out our Q1, Q2 and Q3 updates). To date, TAG has not identified any
significant coordinated influence campaigns targeting, or attempting to influence, U.S. voters
on our platforms.

Since last summer, TAG has tracked a large spam network linked to China attempting to run
an influence operation, primarily on YouTube. This network has a presence across multiple
platforms, and acts by primarily acquiring or hijacking existing accounts and posting spammy
content in Mandarin such as videos of animals, music, food, plants, sports, and games. A
small fraction of these spam channels will then post videos about current events. Such
videos frequently feature clumsy translations and computer-generated voices. Researchers
at Graphika and FireEye have detailed how this network behaves—including its shift from

posting content in Mandarin about issues related to Hong Kong and China’s response to
COVID-19, to including a small subset of content in English and Mandarin about current
events in the U.S. (such as protests around racial justice, the wildfires on the West Coast,
and the U.S. response to COVID-19).

We’ve taken an aggressive approach to identifying and removing content from this network—
for example, in Q3 alone, our Trust and Safety teams terminated more than 3,000 YouTube
channels. As a result, this network hasn’t been able to build an audience. Most of the videos
we identify have fewer than 10 views, and most of these views appear to come from related
spam accounts rather than actual users. So while this network has posted frequently, the
majority of this content is spam and we haven’t seen it effectively reach an actual audience
on YouTube. We’ve shared our findings on this network in our Q2 and Q3 TAG bulletins and
will continue to update there.

New COVID-19 targets
As the course of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we’ve seen threat actors evolve their
tactics as well. In previous posts, we discussed targeting of health organizations as well as
attacker efforts to impersonate the World Health Organization. This summer, we and others
observed threat actors from China, Russia and Iran targeting pharmaceutical companies and
researchers involved in vaccine development efforts.

In September, we started to see multiple North Korea groups shifting their targeting towards
COVID-19 researchers and pharmaceutical companies, including those based in South
Korea. One campaign used URL shorteners and impersonated the target’s webmail portal in
an attempt to harvest email credentials. In a separate campaign, attackers posed as
recruiting professionals to lure targets into downloading malware.

Tackling DDoS attacks as an industry
In the threat actor toolkit, different types of attacks are used for different purposes: Phishing
campaigns can be used like a scalpel—targeting specific groups or individuals with
personalized lures that are more likely to trick them into taking action (like clicking on a
malware link), while DDoS attacks are more like a hatchet—disrupting or blocking a site or a
service entirely. While it’s less common to see DDoS attacks rather than phishing or hacking
campaigns coming from government-backed threat groups, we’ve seen bigger players
increase their capabilities in launching large-scale attacks in recent years. For example in
2017, our Security Reliability Engineering team measured a record-breaking UDP
amplification attack sourced out of several Chinese ISPs (ASNs 4134, 4837, 58453, and
9394), which remains the largest bandwidth attack of which we are aware.

Addressing state-sponsored DDoS attacks requires a coordinated response from the internet
community, and we work with others to identify and dismantle infrastructure used to conduct
attacks. Going forward, we’ll also use this blog to report attribution and activity we see in this
space from state-backed actors when we can do so with a high degree of confidence and in
a way that doesn’t disclose information to malicious actors.
