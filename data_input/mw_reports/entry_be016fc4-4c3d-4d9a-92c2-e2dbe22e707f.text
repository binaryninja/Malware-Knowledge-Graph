Around the World With Zeus Sphinx: From Canada to Australia and Back

IBM X-Force researchers recently identified new infection campaigns delivering distinct Zeus
Sphinx Trojan variants to online banking users in Canada and Australia. This is the first time
our researchers have observed Sphinx campaigns with dedicated configurations targeting
financial institutions in either of the two countries. We believe they are part of ongoing testing
by Sphinx operators.
Sphinx has been keeping low levels of activity since August 2016, when it was detected in
attacks on Brazilian banks. The malware authors have been making small, incremental
upgrades to the code.
The recent configurations targeting online banking consumers in Canada and Australia are
used sparingly in what looks like low-volume testing, not full-blown infection campaigns. The
malware’s operators appear to be looking very carefully to determine which geographies
offer the paths of least resistance.

Zeus Sphinx Targets Banks in Canada and Australia
In Canada, Sphinx’s operators included URLs for over 33 financial institutes. They focused
their target list on credit unions, likely seeing them as the lower hanging fruit in the Canadian
financial sector. The malware’s targets are consumer accounts.

The Canada-focused Sphinx operators are most likely familiar with the cybercrime arena.
According to our research team, they used the same attack servers that facilitated the Zeus
Citadel and Ramnit attacks in early 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The
webinjections share familiar code patterns with other banking Trojans, indicating that the
attackers likely bought them from an injection-writing service.

Familiar Tricks
In their recent campaigns, Sphinx’s operators have been using two distribution methods to
spread the malware to new victims: email messages containing malicious Word documents
that launch a visual basic for applications (VBA) loader and malvertising schemes designed
to spread the Sundown exploit kit (EK).
The use of the Sundown EK provides further evidence that Sphinx’s operators may be linked
to other commercial malware operators. Sundown has been evolving since the fourth quarter
of 2016, from a relatively small, second-tier kit into one of the most prominent EKs in
circulation. It includes older exploits for Internet Explorer, Flash and Silverlight. It has been
previously connected with other banking Trojans such as Kronos and with previous malware
campaigns in Canada.
In Australia, the configuration targets a mix of 40 major banks, credit unions and payment
providers. That configuration also targets some banks based in the U.S.

IBM X-Force research reported past Sphinx campaigns launched against Brazilian banks in
2015 and U.K. banks in 2016.

Financial Malware: A Global Perspective
From a global perspective, Sphinx is counted as part of the overall Zeus family of Trojans,
since it is almost entirely based on the leaked Zeus v2.0.8.9 source code.
With multiple Zeus variations such as Panda, Sphinx and Floki Bot active in the wild, Zeus’s
codebase maintains the top position as the most active banking Trojan family. Different
variants are operated by numerous cybercrime factions worldwide.
