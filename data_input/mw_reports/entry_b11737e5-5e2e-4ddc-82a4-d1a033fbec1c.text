Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Foreword
Over the past several weeks, various elements of a more substantial breach of
IT supplier Wipro has become public.
Investigative journalist Brian Krebs first reported the attack on his website
“Krebs on Security,” which explained how Wipro’s IT systems were
compromised and used to attack the company's customers. After contacting
Wipro, Krebs followed up on his article by publishing updates on the
breach. While Wipro was generally close-lipped on the incident, some of the
victims breached through Wipro spoke with him and provided Indicators of
Compromise (IOCs) they uncovered. Krebs proceeded to publish this small set
of IOCs on his website.
However, Wipro was far from the first company to be compromised by this
campaign and was only one of a long list of targets dating back to 2016. While
a spotlight was shone on this attack due to the high visibility of Wipro, we’ve
written this report to shed light on the far more critical story around this
attacker:

This campaign goes far beyond Wipro
The sophisticated, highly targeted nature of their attacks
The sheer breadth of their targets
The widely available tools they used to execute their attacks and feign
legitimacy
Their unique monetization techniques leveraging gift card infrastructure

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Executive Summary
Using our vast collection grid and unique external view of threat
actor operations, RiskIQ can piece together a more complete
picture of this actor group and their attack campaigns, tools, and
possible motives. This report is by no means a comprehensive
analysis but builds a detailed narrative of widely-reported events.
The actors in this attack have been operating since mid-2016,
and analysis of their targets, based on companies included in
their phishing domains, indicates that the actors were primarily
targeting major gift card retailers, distributors, and card
processors. As a result, we believe gaining access to gift card
infrastructure was part of a unique monetization process and
indicates that their motives may be financial.
These attacks followed a roughly consistent kill chain. To create
effective email phishing campaigns and appear legitimate
to targets' network security, they leveraged widely used
email marketing and analytics tools. These phishing emails
targeted retailers, employee reward programs, and many
other organizations dealing in gift cards. With access to this
gift card infrastructure, the attackers went on to use money
transfer services, clearinghouses, and other payment processing
institutions to monetize.
The actors appear to utilize commercially available and opensource software, including, ironically, platforms meant to train
employees in phishing prevention, along with PowerShell to steal
credentials and certificates to use toward broader reach. One
of these PowerShell scripts, BabySharkPro (to which we allude
in the title of this report), is often associated with North Korean
threat activity, but this may have been a false flag put in place by
the actors to mislead researchers.

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

We believe subsequent attacks on IT infrastructure organizations
like Wipro and several others represented broader targeting by
the threat group in an attempt to widen its reach.

Infrastructure overlap in PDNS, WHOIS, and SSL certificate
data sets allowed RiskIQ to build out a more comprehensive
understanding of actor-owned infrastructure, possible targets,
and a timeline of the attack campaigns. This report is an analysis
of these campaigns, their operators, and their targets.

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Timeline
RiskIQ has identified at least five distinct attack campaigns based off analysis
of the actor-owned infrastructure. We built this timeline with both Passive DNS
and SSL Certificate data collected by RiskIQ technology. In most instances,
the attackers targeted an organization for only a short period, allowing their
phishing pages to be up for just one or two days after they sent out their
malicious emails. After this time, the server stopped responding for the
phishing hostnames, and we no longer observed DNS resolutions for them.
The first campaign appears to have started in May of 2016 and continued
through August of 2016. During this initial attack campaign, the actors’ targets
are as follows:
Eight companies across the below industries over four months:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Retail Organizations
Digital Marketing / Marketing Automation
Employee Rewards Providers
Customer Loyalty & Recognition
Gift Card providers
Information Technology

The second campaign was active from February 2017 - March of 2017 and
retargeted four of the same companies initially targeted during the 2016
campaign:
•
•
•

Gift Card Providers
Employee Rewards Providers
Customer Loyalty & Recognition

Actors launched a third campaign on November 2017 targeting four new
organization (one a subsidiary of a previous target) across the following
industries:
•
•
•

6

Payment Transfer Services
Point of Sale, Prepaid Services, Money Transfer
Information Technology (online fax service)

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

The actors' fourth attack campaign started in February of 2018 and continued
through May of 2018. Actors targeted 23 companies overall, including seven
organizations they had previously targeted.
The following industries were targeted:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Retail
Digital Marketing / Marketing Automation
Loyalty Rewards
Gift Card providers
Information Technology
Payment Transfer Services
Point of Sale, Prepaid Services, Money Transfer
Payment Services
Travel Platforms

The actors 5th campaign took place between January 2019 - May 2019. This
campaign is the most well known and the one associated with the Wipro
breach. This campaign significantly expanded the groups targeting list and
included a larger focus on IT outsourcers, consultants, and managed service
providers.
Actors targeted 24 organizations
•
•

7 previous targets
17 New organizations

The following industries were targeted:
•
•
•
•
•

Targets
Our target analysis is based on the fact that the actors used fully qualified
domain names (FQDNs) with the target organization name or domain. While
we can determine organizations of interest to this actor group based on
infrastructure, a target does not imply a victim or that the actor group was
successful in breaching the organization.
Our analysis of the infrastructure used in the attack campaigns led us to
determine that this actor group is targeting the following industries/verticals:

Unknown
There is also a large pool of unknown targets and victims. Unlike most of the
phishing attacks in this campaign, the infrastructure used to target these
unknown targets did not include the organization's name so we could not
identify them.

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Targeting Hypotheses
Analysis of the targeted organizations across all attack campaigns highlights a
few common threads:
•

Traditional retail organizations are significant targets
•
•

•

Company and employee rewards programs
•
•

•

Example targets: Incomm, Greendot, BlackHawk Networks, Wolfe
Possible targeting theory: Actors need a way to convert gift cards
into currency and effectively transfer funds to more traditional
institutions

Digital marketing and marketing automation firms
•
•
•

•

Example targets: Affinion Group, O.C. Tanner, Achievers
Possible targeting theory: Most of these rewards programs offer
broad access to gift card based rewards

Gift card providers and processors
•
•

•

Example targets: Best Buy, Sears, Darden Foods, Costco,
A possible theory for targeting could be that gift cards provide access
to liquid assets outside of the traditional western financial system

Example targets: SmartFocus, Insideview, SendGrid, Socialab
Possible targeting theory: Actors can leverage these platforms and
services for distribution of their phishing emails
RiskIQ has observed some of the above services being used in
conjunction with the actors' attacks

Information Technology
•
•

Example targets: Rackspace, Wipro, Infosys, PCM
A possible theory for targeting is that Rackspace is a major cloud
provider for Financial services and organizations. Actors could be
looking to target the third-party provider to compromise multiple
organizations.

Additional targeting highlights:
•

11

The actors focused on traditional Retail targets in their initial 2016
attack campaign.

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

•

•
•

They expanded targeting in their 2017 attack campaigns to include
organizations’ employee rewards and corporate loyalty programs
which may indicate they needed a broader collection of targets
Travel platforms such as Agoda and Expedia are added to their
expanded targeting list in 2018
Outside of initial targeting of Rackspace, the threat actors do not
expand targeting to include additional information technology
organizations until their now infamous 2019 campaign against Wipro.

Methods of Operation
To create effective email phishing campaigns and appear legitimate to targets'
network security and anti-phishing tools, the attackers leveraged widely
used email marketing and analytics tools. These phishing emails targeted
organizations dealing in gift cards such as retailers and human resources
platforms, using relatively generic templates and switching out the logo and
branding to reflect the target organization.

Phishing Pages
The attackers used phishing pages to attack their targets. These pages have
reasonably generic login forms, and would all be similar except for the names
of the targeted organizations. The attackers did not create these phishing
page designs or the system that serves them themselves—they made use of a
phishing software package called Lucy, which allowed them to automate much
of the work.
When RiskIQ crawlers visit websites, they record all resources and add them
to an index of every resource we’ve ever seen and where we've seen it. We
discovered the attackers' usage of Lucy when we compared the phishing
pages used in the different campaigns and noticed a lot of shared resources.
When we compared hosts returning the same resources, many were using
Lucy, adding Lucy as a new web component on which to search for more of
this phishing infrastructure.

12

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Connections to the Lucy Phishing Platform
Analyzing one of the javascript files (detect.js) associated with the actors’
fishing campaign, led RiskIQ analysts to uncover three additional URLs related
to the same file. One of the hosts login[.]microsoftonlineportal[.]net - was
of particular interest as it appeared similar to the actors' domain registration
structure.

https://community.riskiq.com/search/login.microsoftonlineportal.net

Investigating the domain’s resolution history unveiled IP addresses with
significant typosquatting domains registered that appeared to be targeting
European corporations. Additional analysis of RiskIQ’s component data set
revealed a unique server association for the domains in question: Lucy.

13

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

A query of our RiskIQ’s component database as of May 9th shows 500 hosts
and 183 IP addresses with that server component present:

https://community.riskiq.com/search/components/Lucy

Running a Google search for the phrase “Lucy Server” revealed a possible
connection to a security company based in Zug Switzerland that offers a
SaaS phishing platform for organizations to conduct security and phishing
awareness training:

14

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Lucy Headers
RiskIQ crawlers identified a server installation called Lucy, which shows in the
server header of certain Lucy installations. One interesting thing to note is
that whether or not you see this header depends on how you install Lucy. In
general, it comes down to these installation methods:
•
•

Preconfigured Virtual Machine: Shows Lucy server header
Manual installation through a script: Does not show Lucy server
header
The attackers performed manual installations of their Lucy servers every time,
which means only the Apache headers show most of the time, with Nginx
showing some of the time.

Lucy Phishing Templates
Lucy comes with a variety of default phishing templates, and one of these
templates was used during most of the phishing campaigns—including the now
notorious Wipro case:

Lucy Template: https://wiki.lucysecurity.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&media=prev2.png
Lucy OEM Edition: http://lucysecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OEM-edition.pdf

15

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Additional analysis of this infrastructure associated with the actor groups 2017
campaign and phishing URL surfaced from Hybrid Analysis also show the use
of a second Lucy 60 Second Survey template:

Lucy 60 Second Survey Template

The Lucy platform survey template was used in conjunction with infrastructure
hrsurveyservice[.]com and found on a typo squatting host associated with
Achievers corp, an employee recognition and rewards platform acquired by
BlackHawk Networks.

16

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

https://community.riskiq.com/search/achievers.hrsurveyservice.com

Analysis of the hybrid analysis match, shows a SendGrid URL scanned using
the platform, which redirects to phishing domain achievers[.]hrsurveyservice[.]
com, which is using the Lucy 60 second survey template.

https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/

17

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

With all its automation, Lucy also lets a user easily generate an SSL certificate
for its attack campaigns using certificate provider Let’s Encrypt, which the
attackers did:

Lucy SSL Configuration: https://wiki.lucysecurity.com/doku.php?id=ssl_configuration

Digital Marketing for Phishing Delivery, Tracking, & Analytics
RiskIQ has observed the use of digital marketing solutions such as Socialab,
SendGrid, and Campaign Monitor for phishing email link-tracking. Analysis of
known actor-owned phishing domains shows possible victims submitting the
tracking URLs to sites such as VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and urlscan.io to
determine if the URLs in question are malicious.

https://www.virustotal.com/#/url/
bbd1d2adc42a3101ace36f8034a9c22d0963ee29612bf0959260957a908d01d9/details

18

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

The use of these analytics and marketing services also aid actors in masking
the actual malicious link, allowing them to bypass an organization’s security
controls, which catch or filter these messages at an email gateway and trick
even vigilant users into thinking the link is legitimate.
Additionally, the Lucy platform supports API integrations with external
mail servers, highlighting in its documentation how easy it is to integrate
with SendGrid. The documentation calls out, “in Lucy, you can use a
prepaid, external mail server with an excellent reputation as your default
communications method […]. There are a few advantages to this model
especially if all other mail methods of mail delivery fail due to SPAM filtering.”

https://wiki.lucysecurity.com/doku.php?id=mail_delivery_methods_in_lucy

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Implants & Tools
The attackers make use of several different tools once they have gained an
initial foothold via stolen credentials. In general, they employ a combination of
legitimate tools for monitoring, remote access, and lateral movement, as well as
a combination of Powershell scripts with Mimikatz to elevate privileges or aid in
monitoring and lateral movement.

Legitimate Tools
As mentioned, the attackers make use of legitimate tools as part of the
infiltration into internal networks of corporations. Because these tools are legal,
it makes them harder to spot, particularly if the targeted organizations also use
them. However, if they don’t, these tools could become excellent indicators of
compromise.
Because these tools are legitimate we won’t be providing extensive file IOCs
as it depends on the used build for a target, all we can denote is that these
legitimate tools are part of the attacker’s arsenal.
We are aware of the attacker using the following tools during their internal
foothold:
•
•

ScreenConnect: This tool gives them remote control over a machine in
the form of visual (or command-line based) access.
EMCO Remote Installer: This tool gives them capabilities to deploy any
tool they want across the network. This tool does require a certain level
of access to the network which one of the later discussed PowerShell
implants provides them, by using Mimikatz.

Our visibility on these attackers is strictly external, which means we do not
have 100% coverage on the aspects of the threat actors' internal movements.
The above list includes the only two tools we are aware they use; the odds are
that there are more of these tools.
We'd love to collaborate with those who encountered this adversary during
incident response to see if we can broaden our knowledge and profile(s).

20

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

The attackers also used small PowerShell scripts to rename the ScreenConnect
product name on compromised machines:

These Powershell scripts were staged from remote servers, one example is: serveresults.com/
css/indiapro.ps1.11 (MD5: dd5986339aaf23f2baf8c245923a0f69).

PowerShell
The attackers combined their use of legitimate tools with PowerShell scripts
taken from public repositories.
BabySharkPro
One of the tools used by the attackers is for the most part a very large
PowerShell script which they use to steal credentials and locally stored
certificates. We found multiple different builds of the same tool, they contain
the same code:
• 28c806cb8c91ab66987ac1ec88344296
• e2e88d6ea5d5d2a4c7b8039988644043
• f6ea268c7e184f580029aec42f2a98f8
• d6472dcebce348d693e68b90099d9ede
The script contains a lot of PowerShell script, which we discuss below, which
the attackers encapsulated in one large function scope called BabySharkPro:

21

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

What is more important about this PowerShell script is what it contains: a
custom Mimikatz build. The PowerShell script maps a custom build of Mimikatz
in memory and runs the following commands to pull down data:
• sekurlsa::logonpasswords exit
This command dumps the current and recently logged in users, including
password information and some general account information.
• crypto::cng crypto::capi "crypto::certificates /export"
"crypto::certificates /export /systemstore:CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_
LOCAL_MACHINE" exit
Exports the locally stored certificates to disk
The unique thing about these commands is the custom-compiled Mimikatz
build on which the attacker used them. The fact that it was custom-compiled
makes it an interesting sample—it does not ever hit the filesystem, as it is
executed in memory only.
This custom build of Mimikatz was compiled on Saturday, August 4th, 2018, at
00:05:41, which matches the timelines we have on the attacker's activities. The
MD5 for this custom build is: 8aea2ae91cc084731a08aa231e79a430.
The code used in the tool seems to be stitched-together modules taken from
the PowerSploit module framework: https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/
PowerSploit.

Empire: Get-Keystores
Another module we found, which shows the attackers sticking with their
preference of PowerShell scripts, is a stripped copy of the PowerShell Empire
Get-Keystrokes.ps1 module. The attackers removed the comments and author
information from the original file from the Empire project GitHub: https://
github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/
collection/Get-Keystrokes.ps1
MD5 for the modified keylogger is: 502fbbdacada9215ed0d026c70f983e1

22

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Staging of payloads
The attackers made use of both the /js/ and /CSS/ subfolders on the server,
but this wasn’t the only staging method the attackers used. They also made
use of GitHub repositories. An account named "onsmooth" maintained
repositories which contained PowerShell scripts similar to the one seen on the
serveresults.com server.

One example of the used GitHub raw URLs to stage the PowerShell script:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onsmooth/kors/master/bsansi.ps1

23

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

The onsmooth username is also interesting as it mimics a pattern for a domain
name used to registered other infrastructure back in their 2016 campaign:

Source: https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/craig@smooth-on.com

Infrastructure
The infrastructure associated with these attack campaigns highlight how all
actors develop patterns and can overlap infrastructure-based operational
security failures. This group consistently leverages the same hosting providers,
overlaps SSL certificates on common IP addresses, and uses similar WHOIS
data which ties infrastructure together.

Hosting Providers
Analysis of the IP addresses used by this actor group show consistent use of
the following hosting providers
•
•
•

24

Sunnyvision
Solar Communications
King Servers

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Analysis of the attack infrastructure shows that the actors initially leveraged
Sunvision and Solar Communications, two small hosting service providers, to
initially host their phishing domains in May and June of 2016 before switching
over to King Servers infrastructure in July of 2016.

SSL Certificate Usage and Overlap
Analysis of SSL Certificate data associated with the actors early 2016 IP
addresses shows the presence of default Lucy phish platform certificates:

https://community.riskiq.com/search/95.183.52.99

https://community.riskiq.com/search/124.248.205.18

25

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

The presence of these default install certificates from the Lucy platform
strengthen the connection to the actors' use of the SaaS security platform as
their tool for conducting their phishing attacks against victim targets.
Besides the presence of these default certificates, we were also able to identify
common attack infrastructure based on overlaps in self-signed certificates
generated and used for the management of the Lucy platform and other
infrastructure associated with the actor groups infrastructure, as can be seen in
the screenshot below.

https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/
sha1/51d4b4cd19ef174a257840f3d1a419f839014f6d

This certificate overlap and other similar occurrences among this actor group
allowed us to surface a significant amount of this actor group's infrastructure
across multiple campaigns.

26

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Domain Registrants
While most of the actor-owned domains for this campaign were registered
using privacy protection services, RiskIQ analysts were able to identify unique
registrant data in historical WHOIS records that assisted us in understanding
the broader scope of this attack.

Jacob Rummel
Digging through infrastructure from early 2016’s campaign, we were able
to surface some early domains registered without privacy protection. As
seen in the screen capture below, the domain bhnetwork.online, possibly
typosquatting Blackhawk networks, one of our actor groups know targets.

https://community.riskiq.com/search/ns1.bhnetwork.online

27

Gift Card Sharks Intelligence Report

Pivoting off of this unique WHOIS data we were able to surface 19 additional
domains registered using the exact same information inside of RiskIQ’s
historical WHOIS database:

https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/deutsch@onlinebingo.eu

Ivan Wilshea
RiskIQ analysts were also able to identify domains associated with the actors’
2017 attack campaigns with unmasked WHOIS records. One interesting
note this time was that the domains in question appear to have initially been
registered using a privacy protection service during active usage in the 2017
campaign. However, it seems the protection service lapsed, and the registrar
exposed the real WHOIS data in May of this year.

https://community.riskiq.com/search/imail-ssl.com

A search of the above Name, Organization, and Email address across RiskIQ’s
historical WHOIS database shows seven domains registered using the same
information. Analysis of these domains identified FQDNs used in attack
campaigns or as name servers for attack infrastructure.

https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/yaqhxrcr@emltmp.com

Conclusion
This analysis highlights how organizations can build off of a small set of
network-based IOCs to better derive context about an adversary and their
attack campaigns, the scope of their activity, and the overarching impact of the
adversary’s overall operations. Using a multitude of data sets and pivot points,
analysts can gain a broader knowledge of adversary infrastructure
This actor group operated over a sustained period—since at least 2016,
targeting specific organization across multiple coordinated campaigns. The use
of open-source tooling allowed them to scale their operations while limiting
analysts ability to easily attribute activity to a known actor group based on
tool reuse. Their operational tempo increased to ramp up targeting and scope
over time, which indicates that they achieved at least some success throughout
their campaigns

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Due to the size of the infrastructure, the amount of IOCs is much more than
what we would put in our report document. We decided to provide appendix
documents containing the full set of infrastructure and meta-data around the
infrastructure with this report. Please refer to this appendix for the full details
regarding the infrastructure.
The appendix document details are also made available as flat files with this
