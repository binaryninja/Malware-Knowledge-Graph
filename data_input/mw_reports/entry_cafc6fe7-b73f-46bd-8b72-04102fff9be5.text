ScanPOS, new POS malware being
distributed by Kronos

2016-11-15
00:00:00 -0500

Summary:
Just in time for the holidays, a brand new Point Of Sale (POS) malware family has
been discovered.
Booz Allen responded to a Kronos phishing campaign that involved a document
with a malicious macro that downloaded the Kronos banking malware. When
running, the Kronos payload will download several other pieces of malware, but
the one that caught our eye is a new credit card dumper with very low detection.
Booz Allen is tracking this malware under the name ScanPOS due to the build
string present in the malware.

1/8

C:\Users\example\documents\visual studio
2010\Projects\scan3\Release\scan3.pdb

At the time of this writing, ScanPOS only scored 1/55 on Virustotal:

ScanPOS, while not extraordinarily impressive or unique, is a new family. It
performs the same basic tasks that all other POS malware performs, yet sneaks
by almost every developed detection technique. ScanPOS does little in terms of
evading detection, which can help it blend in a production environment. When
code is heavily packed, it will often get picked up by generic heuristics.

Phish
The Kronos phish that was delivering the malware was a very basic email with the
following body:
An Employee has just been terminated.
Name: Tanner Williamson
Employee profile: EmployeeID-6283.doc
Emplid: 2965385
Rcd#: 0
Termination Date: 11/17/2016

Relevant headers are below:
TIME-STAMP: "16-11-14_13.44.23"
CONTENT-DISPOSITION: "attachment; filename='EmployeeID-6283.doc'"
X-VIRUS-SCANNED: "Debian amavisd-new at hosting5.skyinet.pl"
Subject : An Employee has just been terminated.
From: HR <johns.brueggemann@banctec.com>
Mail-From: web1@hosting5.skyinet.pl
1st rec: hosting23.skyinet.pl
2nd rec:hosting23.skyinet.pl

When enabling the macro on EmployeID-6283.doc, the macro will download
profile.excel-sharepoint[.]com/doc/office.exe

(Kronos Payload) and execute it. Kronos will then download and execute
ScanPOS from

Credit Card Dumping
On execution, the malware will grab information about the current process and get
the user (calling GetUserNameA). Privileges are checked to ensure that the
malware has the ability to peek into other processes’ memory space by checking
for SeDebugPrivilege (see below).

The malware will then enter an infinite loop, padded with sleeps, to dump process
memory on the box to search for credit card track data. During this loop, the
malware iterates processes using Process32FirstW/Process32Next from a
process list obtained via CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.

The iterator obtains a handle to the process by using OpenProcess, which is then
checked against a basic whitelist, to avoid unnecessary system processes:

3/8

If the name of the process passes a check against the whitelist, the malware will
continue to get process memory information by calling VirtualQueryEx and then
eventually fall to ReadProcessMemory.

4/8

Once process memory is obtained, the scanning for credit card track data can
begin. The main logic behind this is in function 0x4026C0.
The logic starts with basic sentinel checks and a starting number of 3,4,5 or 6.

5/8

The malware will use a custom search routine (rather than regex) to find potential
numbers.

After the malware does several checks for credit card information, it will pass the
potential candidate to Luhn’s algorithm for basic validation.

6/8

When it finds a potential candidate that passes Luhn’s, it will continue searching
for numbers (anything between 0 and 9) until it hits a “?” marking the end of the
track data.

Network Connectivity
Once the potential card numbers are found, the information is sent via HTTP
POST to invoicesharepoint[.]com.

Conclusion
ScanPOS is being distributed through an active campaign. With only 1 anti-virus
engine flagging this executable as malicious, this family helps show the constant
pressure that AV vendors face while trying to stay ahead of the curve. Being
7/8

distributed in a macro is a simple technique that has been covered in detail in
many different blog posts and may have helped this family hide a little bit in the
noise.
