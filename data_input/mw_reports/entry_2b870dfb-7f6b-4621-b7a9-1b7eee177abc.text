#StopRansomware: Cuba Ransomware
SUMMARY
Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an
ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for
network defenders that detail various ransomware variants
and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware
advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of
compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against
ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all
#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other
ransomware threats and no-cost resources.

Actions to take today to mitigate
cyber threats from ransomware:
•
•
•

Prioritize remediating known
exploited vulnerabilities.
Train users to recognize and
report phishing attempts.
Enable and enforce phishingresistant multifactor
authentication.

(Updated December 12, 2022) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and CISA updated this
CSA to include additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) provided by a trusted third party. See
table 6. (End of Update.)
The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA
to disseminate known Cuba ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated with Cuba ransomware actors
identified through FBI investigations, third-party reporting, and open-source reporting. This advisory
updates the December 2021 FBI Flash: Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba
Ransomware.
Note: While this ransomware is known by industry as “Cuba ransomware,” there is no indication
Cuba ransomware actors have any connection or affiliation with the Republic of Cuba.
Since the release of the December 2021 FBI Flash, the number of U.S. entities compromised by
Cuba ransomware has doubled, with ransoms demanded and paid on the increase.
This year, Cuba ransomware actors have added to their TTPs, and third-party and open-source
reports have identified a possible link between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access
Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors.
FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section
of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Cuba ransomware and other ransomware
operations.
To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI
field office at fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices. When available, please include the following information regarding the incident:
date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the
name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact. To request incident response resources
or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at Report@cisa.dhs.gov.
This document is marked TLP:CLEAR. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information carries
minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release. Subject to
standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be distributed without restriction. For more information on the Traffic

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Overview
Since the December 2021 release of FBI Flash: Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba
Ransomware, FBI has observed Cuba ransomware actors continuing to target U.S. entities in the
following five critical infrastructure sectors: Financial Services, Government Facilities, Healthcare and
Public Health, Critical Manufacturing, and Information Technology. As of August 2022, FBI has
identified that Cuba ransomware actors have:
•
•

Compromised 101 entities, 65 in the United States and 36 outside the United States.
Demanded 145 million U.S. Dollars (USD) and received 60 million USD in ransom payments.

Cuba Ransomware Actors’ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
As previously reported by FBI, Cuba ransomware actors have leveraged the following techniques to
gain initial access into dozens of entities in multiple critical infrastructure sectors:
•
•
•
•

Known vulnerabilities in commercial software [T1190]
Phishing campaigns [T1566]
Compromised credentials [T1078]
Legitimate remote desktop protocol (RDP) tools [T1563.002]

After gaining initial access, the actors distributed Cuba ransomware on compromised systems
through Hancitor—a loader known for dropping or executing stealers, such as Remote Access
Trojans (RATs) and other types of ransomware, onto victims’ networks.
Since spring 2022, Cuba ransomware actors have modified their TTPs and tools to interact with
compromised networks and extort payments from victims.[1],[2]
Cuba ransomware actors have exploited known vulnerabilities and weaknesses and have used tools
to elevate privileges on compromised systems. According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42,[2] Cuba
ransomware actors have:
•
•

•

Exploited CVE-2022-24521 in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver to steal
system tokens and elevate privileges.
Used a PowerShell script to identify and target service accounts for their associated Active
Directory Kerberos ticket. The actors then collected and cracked the Kerberos tickets offline
via Kerberoasting [T1558.003].
Used a tool, called KerberCache, to extract cached Kerberos tickets from a host’s Local
Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) memory [T1003.001].

•

Used a tool to exploit CVE-2020-1472 (also known as “ZeroLogon”) to gain Domain
Administrative privileges [T1068]. This tool and its intrusion attempts have been reportedly
related to Hancitor and Qbot.

According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Cuba ransomware actors use tools to evade detection while
moving laterally through compromised environments before executing Cuba ransomware.
Specifically, the actors, “leveraged a dropper that writes a kernel driver to the file system called
ApcHelper.sys. This targets and terminates security products. The dropper was not signed;
however, the kernel driver was signed using the certificate found in the LAPSUS NVIDIA leak."
[T1562.001].[2]
In addition to deploying ransomware, the actors have used “double extortion” techniques, in which
they exfiltrate victim data, and (1) demand a ransom payment to decrypt it and, (2) threaten to publicly
release it if a ransom payment is not made.[2]

Cuba Ransomware Link to RomCom and Industrial Spy Marketplace
Since spring 2022, third-party and open-source reports have identified an apparent link between
Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom RAT actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors:
•
•

•

According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Cuba ransomware actors began using RomCom
malware, a custom RAT, for command and control (C2).[2]
Cuba ransomware actors may also be leveraging Industrial Spy ransomware. According to
third-party reporting, suspected Cuba ransomware actors compromised a foreign healthcare
company. The threat actors deployed Industrial Spy ransomware, which shares distinct
similarities in configuration to Cuba ransomware. Before deploying the ransomware, the actors
moved laterally using Impacket and deployed the RomCom RAT and Meterpreter Reverse
Shell HTTP/HTTPS proxy via a C2 server [T1090].
Cuba ransomware actors initially used their leak site to sell stolen data; however, around May
2022, the actors began selling their data on Industrial Spy’s online market for selling stolen
data.[2]

RomCom actors have targeted foreign military organizations, IT companies, and food brokers and
manufacturers.[3][4] The actors copied legitimate HTML code from public-facing webpages, modified
the code, and then incorporated it in spoofed domains [T1584.001], which allowed the RomCom
actors to:
•

•

Host counterfeit Trojanized applications for
o SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM),
o KeePass password manager,
o PDF Reader Pro, (by PDF Technologies, Inc., not an Adobe Acrobat or Reader
product), and
o Advanced IP Scanner software;
Deploy the RomCom RAT as the final stage.

MITIGATIONS
FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential
adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of
compromise by Cuba ransomware:
•

•

•
•

•

•

•

Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,
storage device, the cloud).
Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute for Standards and Technology
(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.
o Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64
characters in length.
o Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.
o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.
o Avoid reusing passwords.
o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.
o Disable password “hints.”
o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.
Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular
and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in
users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.
o Require administrator credentials to install software.
Require multifactor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly for
webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.
Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of
the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to
cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching SonicWall firewall vulnerabilities and known exploited
vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems. Note: SonicWall maintains a vulnerability list that
includes Advisory ID, CVE, and mitigation. Their list can be found at
psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-list.
Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help
prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—
various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.
Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral
movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly
useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon
network connections for each host.
Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all
hosts.

Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or
unrecognized accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according
to the principle of least privilege.
Disable unused ports.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For
example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed
and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust
model). JIT sets a network-wide policy in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the
Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their
requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a
set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and
lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat
actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or
moving laterally.
Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. By
instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or
only have irretrievable data.
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and
covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.

REPORTING
FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication
to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with ransomware actors,
Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.
FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be
recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,
encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit
activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and
CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents immediately. Report to a local FBI Field
Office, or CISA at us-cert.cisa.gov/report.
