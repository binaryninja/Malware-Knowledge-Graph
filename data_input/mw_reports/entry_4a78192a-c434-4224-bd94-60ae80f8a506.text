Threat actors are distributing malware using phishing themes related to the invasion of
Ukraine, aiming to infect their targets with remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent
Tesla and Remcos.
It is common for malware distributors to take advantage of trending global events to trick the
recipient into opening email attachments, and at this time, there is nothing more closely
watched than Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Using this theme, threat actors are sending malicious emails that install RATs on target
systems to gain remote access, steal sensitive information, conduct network
reconnaissance, disable security software, and generally prepare the ground for more
potent payloads.
The report of the latest malicious operations comes from Bitdefender Labs, whose
researchers have been tracking two distinct phishing campaigns since March 01, 2022.
1/6

Targeting manufacturers
Ukraine is a manufacturing hub for various parts, and the current conflict has forced
factories to close, inevitably creating supply chain problems and shortages.
The first campaign spotted by Bitdefender attempts to exploit these concerns by targeting
manufacturers with a ZIP attachment that supposedly contains a survey that they are
required to fill out to help their customers develop backup plans.

However, the ZIP archive contains the Agent Tesla RAT, which has been heavily used
in various phishing campaigns in the past.
Most (83%) of the phishing emails in this campaign originated from the Netherlands, while
the targets are based in the Czech Republic (14%), South Korea (23%), Germany (10%),
the UK (10%), and the US (8%).

Fake order holds
The second campaign involves the impersonation of a South Korean healthcare company
that manufactures in-vitro diagnostic systems.
The message to targets claims that all orders have been put on hold due to flight and
shipment restrictions from Ukraine.

The attached Excel document supposedly contains more details about the order, but in
reality, it’s a macro-laced file that exploits the always popular four-years-old Microsoft Office
Equation Editor bug tracked as CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to deliver the Remcos RAT
on the system.
89% of these emails originate from German IP addresses, while the recipients are based in
Ireland (32%), India (17%), and the US (7%).

Crypto-donation scams on the rise
Bitdefender also reports seeing an explosion in the number of scammers who attempt to
convince users they are legitimate charities collecting donations to support Ukraine.
These scams have intensified, with malicious actors impersonating the Ukrainian
government, the Act for Peace, UNICEF, and the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund.

Some example subject lines used by the scammers are:
Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and USDT.
HELP UKRAINE stop the war!
Ukraine Humanitarian Donation
Donate to Ukraine, Help save a life: Please read
Urgent! Help Children in Ukraine
4/6

Subject: Help Ukraine

Stay safe
In general, but especially during periods of turbulence and uncertainty, avoid clicking on
links or downloading attachments arriving at your inbox via unsolicited communications.
If you want to donate to Ukraine, consider donating directly to the Save Life organization or
the Ukrainian Red Cross. Also, the official Ukraine government has published the following
cryptocurrency addresses to use for donations.
Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin,
Ethereum and USDT.
BTC - 357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P
ETH and USDT (ERC-20) - 0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14
— Ukraine / Україна (@Ukraine) February 26, 2022
For protection against phishing emails and other online threats, the Romanian National
Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) and Bitdefender offer free protection for citizens and
companies alike and extend the trial period of 'Total Security' to 90 days.
