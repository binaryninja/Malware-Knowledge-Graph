There is no cease-fire in the continuing battle against malware. Qbot, a banking trojan malware
active since 2008, is back in business with new functions and new stealth capabilities. In the past
12 years, this malware has gone by a handful of names, including Qakbot and Pinkslipbot.
Despite all the variations and evolutions, Qbot’s main goal has remained the same: collect browsing
activity and steal bank account credentials and other financial information. Attackers usually infect
victims using phishing techniques to lure victims to websites that use exploits to inject Qbot via a
dropper. It does this through a combination of techniques that subvert the victim’s web sessions,
including keylogging, credential theft, cookie exfiltration, and process hooking.
Previously, Qbot also used worm self-replication techniques to copy itself over shared drives and
removable media. Qbot is still Windows-based, but this latest version adds both detection and
research-evasion techniques. It has a new packing layer that scrambles and hides the code from
scanners and signature-based tools. It also includes anti-virtual machine techniques, which helps it
resist forensic examination. However, that didn’t deter us analyzing its new capabilities and
documenting the infection flow.

Qbot’s Infection Process
Here’s how the new Qbot infection typically occurs on a targeted computer:

6/10

1. Qbot is loaded into the running explorer.exe memory from an executable introduced via
phishing, an exploit’s dropper, or an open file share.
2. Qbot copies itself into the application folder’s default location, as defined in the %APPDATA%
registry key.
3. Qbot creates a copy of itself in the specific registry key
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to run when the system reboots.
4. Qbot drops a .dat file with a log of the system information and the botnet name.
5. Qbot executes its copy from the %APPDATA% folder and, to cover its tracks, replaces the
originally infected file with a legitimate one.
6. Lastly, Qbot creates an instance of explorer.exe and injects itself into it. The attackers then
use the always-running explorer.exe process to update Qbot from their external commandand-control server.

Qbot Web Banking Target List
Our latest analysis of several sample of the malware from this year showed that Qbot’s focus is on
banks in the United States. This appears to be a dedicated campaign with a browser hijack, or
redirection, as the main attack method when the machine is infected. As Qbot watches a victim’s
web traffic, it looks for specific financial services from which to harvest credentials. We found
specific strings within Qbot that targeted financial institutions, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Financial institutions Qbot targets.

Regional Targeting by Qbot
Analysis of the latest Qbot campaign shows that it is mainly focused on the United States (see
Figure 1), targeting approximately 36 U.S. financial institutions and two banks in Canada and the
Netherlands; the rest of the list contains generic URL targets that might be added as a second
stage in the fraud action.

Conclusion
Qbot has been around for a dozen years with pretty much the same functionality. The targets
changed and features were added, but it’s still primarily about keylogging and, secondarily, about
extracting a victim’s personal data. As Qbot waxes and wanes in popularity with attackers, it is hard
to gauge its overall impact on a global scale. However, it is still a viable threat for defenders to be
aware of.

Recommendations
Use updated antivirus software: Antivirus software is still a powerful tool for detecting and
stopping malware infections. Configure it to update its signatures without intervention and to
alert you when it stops functioning.
Apply critical patches: Apply critical patches for vulnerabilities with published, weaponized
exploits for applications that touch the Internet, such as browsers and mail clients.
Inspect encrypted traffic: Most malware and phishing sites are buried within encrypted
SSL/TLS sessions, often using legitimate certificates. Decrypt, inspect, and sanitize this traffic.
Provide meaningful security awareness training: Make it easy for users to report
suspicious behavior. The F5 Labs 2018 Phishing and Fraud Report showed that training
employees to recognize phishing attempts can reduce click-through rates on malicious emails,
links, and attachments from 33% to 13%.
