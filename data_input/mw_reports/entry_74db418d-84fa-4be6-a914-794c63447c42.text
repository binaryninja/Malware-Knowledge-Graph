Recovery

Ransomware continues to be a hot button issue for organizations around the world. APT
actors, commodity malware operators and even attackers who had never used ransomware
before started picking up the trend over the last several years. In years past, attackers turned
to ransomware to exploit an organization’s lack of a good backup plan, disaster recovery
plan, or coax the victim into paying a ransom to maintain their operations and reduce
downtime. However, an unfortunate fact of ransomware infections is how rare full recovery is,
after payment occurs.

Given this fact, as well as several vendors and global government organizations highly
recommending not paying and instead reverting to recovery options, ransomware infections
were becoming less impactful when relying on data encryption alone. This is where the trend
of stealing and holding a victim’s confidential data for ransom has started to become
prevalent amongst ransomware variants, sometimes referred to as ‘doxware.’ Ransomware
“leak sites” are popping up regularly on the dark and clear webs. These leak sites publicly
shame their victims and threaten to release sensitive information if their demands are not
met. This makes ransomware an incredibly formidable foe, requiring organizations to focus
more effort on detection and prevention.
Fortunately for defenders, there are many common calling cards of ransomware. Cyborg
Security researchers performed research and analysis on more than twenty of the top
variants of ransomware, many accounting for highly visible and damaging attacks. In the
following section we’ll break down one of the most common techniques employed by
ransomware, how to detect the multiple variations that are deployed, give specific
examples by variant and how to analyze and attribute observed activity back to the
specific variant. Armed with this information defenders will be able to choose the best hunt
for their organization that can cast a wide net with as little potential for false positives as
possible.

Inhibiting System Recovery – MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1490
There are several methods that ransomware uses in order to inhibit system recovery, stop
further recoveries, and corrupts or deletes available recovery points on a system. The most
common method observed during Cyborg Security’s research was the use of vssadmin to
delete “Shadow Copies” from the system. Given this became nearly common place for
ransomware, developers began exploring other options such as utilizing PowerShell, wmic,
bcdedit, net.exe and wbadmin. The utilization of these built in Windows applications is so
common in ransomware, it’s nearly impossible to attribute the specific ransomware based
solely on the method in which it prevents system backups.

Hypothesis
Dynamic analysis utilizing industry leading malware sandboxes, manual analysis, EDR and
windows logging, it was noted in some cases, dependent on ransomware variant, process
creation events were not logged for each application called within the cmd.exe or
powershell.exe command. As such searching within the command line of a PowerShell or
Command Shell execution must be performed to avoid missing potential attacks. During
analysis it was found bcdedit, wmic, vssadmin, powershell and net were all used as a form of
inhibiting a backup from being taken or utilized for system recovery. Although several

2/7

variants utilize the same technique with the same application it was found several utilized
variations of commands or utilized the application completely different than another, which
also needs to be accounted for within any generated logic.

Response
The majority of analyzed ransomware variants did not exhibit unique deployments of this
technique. As such, analysts will need to review source processes, parent processes and
related process executions or creation events for further signs of a ransomware infection and
attribute the activity to a specific ransomware. The easiest method to attribute the
ransomware variant, if it appears a successful infection is identified, is to search for file write
events or analyze other data from the suspected host looking for files created or modified
with abnormal extensions. Many ransomware variants make it easy and add the variant’s
name as the extension, while others use a randomized string and require other artifacts for
attribution. Other methods can include reviewing services or processes stopped or deleted
by the ransomware binary or script. Often each variant will choose a specific set of services
to disable, stop, delete or uninstall applications. If these methods fail, identifying the directory
and binary name (it’s structure), combined with the already identified artifacts, can assist in
final attribution.

Conclusion
Ransomware deploys a wide array of techniques, often making it difficult to effectively
hunt for several variants at a time. This is especially true for the early stages of the infection
chain, such as the Installation phase, to detect, identify and respond as quickly as possible to
the potential threat. Hunting for ransomware attempting to inhibit a host’s recovery ability is
one of, if not the best methods for identifying potential ransomware attacks, post-delivery.
This is largely due to the limited composition of the commands to carry out the
technique, and its rarity of being observed for legitimate purposes. Although hunting for this
technique may not make it readily apparent which ransomware variant is lurking in your
organization, it’s certainly one of the best bangs for your hunting and time.
