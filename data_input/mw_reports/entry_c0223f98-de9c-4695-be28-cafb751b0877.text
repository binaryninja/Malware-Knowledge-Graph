The ransomware gang behind the highly publicized attack on CD Projekt Red uses a Linux
variant that targets VMware's ESXi virtual machine platform for maximum damage.
As the enterprise increasingly moves to virtual machines for easier backup and resource
management, ransomware gangs are evolving their tactics to create Linux encryptors that
target these servers.
VMware ESXi is one of the most popular enterprise virtual machine platforms. Over the past
year, there has been an increasing number of ransomware gangs releasing Linux
encryptors targeting this platform.
While ESXi is not strictly Linux as it uses its own customer kernel, it does share many
similar characteristics, including the ability to run ELF64 Linux executables.

HelloKitty moves to ESXi
Yesterday, security researcher MalwareHunterTeam found numerous Linux ELF64 versions
of the HelloKitty ransomware targeting ESXi servers and the virtual machines running on
them.
It has been known that HelloKitty utilizes a Linux encryptor, but this is the first sample that
researchers have publicly spotted.
Seems no one mentioned yet, so let me do it: the Linux version of HelloKitty
ransomware was already using esxcli at least in early March for stopping
VMs...@VK_Intel @demonslay335 pic.twitter.com/atSv0OO7YL

MalwareHunterTeam shared samples of the ransomware with BleepingComputer, and you
can clearly see strings referencing ESXi and the ransomware's attempts to shut down
running virtual machines.
First try kill VM:%ld ID:%d
%s
esxcli vm process kill -t=soft -w=%d
Check kill
VM:%ld ID:%d
esxcli vm process kill -t=hard -w=%d
Unable to find
Killed
VM:%ld ID:%d
still running VM:%ld
ID:%d try force
esxcli vm process kill -t=force -w=%d
Check
VM:%ld ID:
%d manual !!!
.README_TO_RESTORE
Find ESXi:%s
esxcli vm process list
World ID:
Process ID:
Running VM:%ld ID:%d
%s
Total VM run on host:
%ld

From the debug messages, we can see that the ransomware uses ESXi's
esxcli command-line management tool to list the running virtual machines on the server
and then shut them down.
Ransomware gangs targeting ESXi servers will shut down virtual machines before
encrypting files to prevent the files from being locked and to avoid data corruption.
Some Darkside affiliates have a tendency to forget to stop all the ESXi daemons
before kicking off the encryption. The result is that sometimes encrypted data can be
interlaced with unencrypted data or that the footer containing the file key is partially
overwritten. Same result.

When shutting down the virtual machines, the ransomware will first try a graceful shutdown
using the 'soft' command:
esxcli vm process kill -t=soft -w=%d

If there are still VMs running, it will try an immediate shutdown of virtual machines using the
'hard' command:
esxcli vm process kill -t=hard -w=%d

Finally, if virtual machines are still running, the malware will use the 'force' command to shut
down any running VMs forcefully.
esxcli vm process kill -t=force -w=%d

After the virtual machines are shut down, the ransomware will begin encrypting
.vmdk (virtual hard disk), .vmsd (metadata and snapshot information), and .vmsn (contains
the active state of the VM) files.
This method is very efficient as it allows a ransomware gang to encrypt many virtual
machines with a single command.
Last month, MalwareHunterTeam also found a Linux version of the REvil ransomware that
targets ESXi servers and used the esxcli command as part of the encryption process.
Emsisoft CTO Fabian Wosar told BleepingComputer at the time that other ransomware
operations, such as Babuk, RansomExx/Defray, Mespinoza, GoGoogle, and the nowdefunct DarkSide, have also created Linux encryptors to target ESXi virtual machines.
"The reason why most ransomware groups implemented a Linux-based version of their
ransomware is to target ESXi specifically," said Wosar.

A bit about HelloKitty
HelloKity has been in operation since November 2020, when a victim first posted about the
ransomware in our forums.
Since then, the threat actors have not been particular actively compared to other humanoperated ransomware operations.
Their most well-known attack has been against CD Projekt Red, where the threat actors
encrypted devices and claim to have stolen source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3,
Gwent, and more.
The threat actors later claimed that someone had purchased the files stolen from CD
Projekt Red.

3/5

This ransomware, or its variants, has been used under different names such as
DeathRansom and Fivehands.

Hacking is terrorism, simply start posting rewards for hackers heads.

<p>Can Lawrence Abrams, or whomever edits these posts, do a simple grammar
check and proof-read before posting... &quot;... it uses its own customer kernel.&quot;
- as in, a kernel that a customer paid for? but you meant &#39;custom&#39; right?
&quot;... not been particular actively compared to other human-operated ransomware
operations.&quot; - actively compared to, vs &quot;active, compared to&quot; And
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s others, but it makes it hard to read when you see errors
like this. Come on... Jesus</p>
