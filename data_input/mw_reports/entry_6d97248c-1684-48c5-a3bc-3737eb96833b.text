Wroba Android banking trojan targets Japan
avira.com/en/blog/the-android-banking-trojan-wroba-shifts-attack-from-south-korea-to-target-users-in-japan
November 11, 2020

The mobile banking trojan Wroba has been around since 2010. It previously targeted
smartphone users, mainly in the U.S, China, South Korea, and the Russian Federation.
Cybercriminals have now expanded Wroba’s targets, shifting their malware campaign to
Japan.
This trojan was first developed as an Android-specific mobile banking trojan, capable of
stealing files related to financial transactions. Once it has infected a device, Wroba uses
SMS to send messages containing malicious links to the host’s stolen contact list.
In this blog, Alexandru Frigioiu, a senior threat researcher at Avira Protection Labs,
analyzes a new sample of the Wroba trojan found in the wild. This variant shifts targets from
South Korea to Japan. It attempts to compromise banking app users in Japan by displaying
a counterfeit version of the Chrome browser with the goal of delivering the payload.

Analysis
We came across a malware sample in the wild. The sample caught our attention because it
displayed attributes such as a randomized file name, package name, and activity name.
These suggest a packed application and Android malware.
Filename: “vAdOyCy.apk”
Package name: “buhb.uabvv.szxkr”
Main activity name: “zuseoje.QiActivity”
We quickly realized the app is suspicious enough to take a closer look at the app
permissions.

Figure 1: Manifest file
Looking at the “Chrome” application label, we identify that the application was trying to pose
as a Chrome browser. However, the discrepancy with the package name made it clear that
it was not Chrome and most likely malware.
Additionally, the app was signed with a test certificate from the Android Open Source
Project used in the past by several other malware families. Although this certificate is used
by some legitimate developers to sign their clean Android apps, this is clearly not the case
here.

Installation screen
During our analysis, we saw that the installation screen was trying to pose as a Chrome
browser. It was also using the legitimate Chrome icon to make it look familiar.

After the permissions were granted, the application was launched, the icon disappeared
from the launcher.

APK file structure
After we analyzed the APK file, we saw that apart from typical files found in an android app,
there was a random file in the “assets” folder:

This is typically used by malware to hide a second DEX or APK dropped at installation.
Then loaded at runtime when the application is launched.
Looking at the contents of the file, we found that it was encrypted. We decompiled the code
to find out what the application was doing with this file.

Main DEX file
The main DEX file is tiny (only 9kb) and we conclude its only function was to decrypt and
load the randomly named file from assets.
After decompiling the code, we searched for the file name and found the following method:

Figure 5: Decryption routine
We saw that the file from assets is being read and processed to look like a custom
decryption routine. After this, a file named “dex” is saved to
“/data/data/buhb.uabvv.szxkr/files/dex”:

Figure 6: Resulting file name
We also saw that this file built the string “dalvik.system.DexClassLoader” out of separate
strings (to avoid detection), which is then used to execute the payload:

The function first opens the file from assets, skips the first 4 bytes, and reads the 5th byte
used as an XOR key. Then reads the rest of the file in 1024 byte blocks, XOR-es it with the
5th byte, and passes the resulting data to the “this.a” method.

Figure 8: Analysis of decryption routine
The next function is decompressing the data using the deflate method:

Figure 9: The deflate method in function
The data is then base64 decoded:

and the result is written to the file:

Now that we know where the decrypted file is stored, we can retrieve it from the device to
analyze it:

Payload analysis
The decrypted dex file
(0cd2b17aa21cd8de63842da21e3464df7bb2bd4a278fffbbfea6b294c3ca9e6d) turned out to
be a malware, as expected.
It was found to be a banking trojan from the Wroba family. This family has been in the wild
since 2010, and its name is a concatenation of two terms, “we” and “rob”.
Malware functionality:
tricks the user that the internet connection will be faster if the (suspicious) permission
is granted
spreads itself directly from the victim’s smartphone by sending phishing messages to
the phone’s contact list
grabs and monitors all incoming and outgoing SMS messages to bypass two-factor
authentication

Conclusion
Avira detects the original APK, dex file, decrypted payload, and other APKs from the Wroba
family as Android/Wroba.
We strongly recommend Android phone users use an anti-virus package. These are
available from Avira and other quality digital security providers.
Consumers should always keep the “Unknown Sources” option disabled in their Android
device’s settings to avoid installing apps from unknown sources. Android applications
should only be installed from official stores such as Google Play, and even then care should
be taken!
Everyone, on any device, Android, Windows, macOS and iOS should avoid clicking on
unknown links received through SMS messages, emails, ads, and social media posts from
untrusted sources.
Finally, mobile phone providers and network operators need to take steps to protect their
customers and consider integrating anti-malware technologies such as Avira’s own Antimalware SDK for Android, and explore threat intelligence solutions that deliver mobile
application reputation information.
