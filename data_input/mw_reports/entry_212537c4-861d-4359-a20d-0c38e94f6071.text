REvil, a sophisticated Russian-speaking ransomware group, frequently works with affiliates
who provide them with access to networks—and negotiate with victims on REvil’s behalf—for
a cut of the ransom. REvil affiliates can collect up to 70 percent of the ransom payment while
REvil operators collect the rest. This is how REvil has historically operated its ransomwareas-a-service model.

REvil’s tactics have recently come under renewed scrutiny. Threat actors operating on XSS
and Exploit are currently reacting to evidence that REvil included a secret backdoor in its
ransomware code—allegedly enabling the ransomware group to steal illicit ransom proceeds
from its affiliates.
On September 20, a threat actor allegedly unearthed a “cryptobackdoor” in REvil’s sample
code and posted the finding on Exploit, an illicit high-tier Russian-language forum. The
backdoor code enables REvil the capability of restoring encrypted files on its own—without
the involvement of the affiliates it originally hired.
Flashpoint analysts note that the backdoor was likely exposed months ago. However, the
September 20 leak represents what appears to be the first time concrete evidence of REvil’s
tactics have been made public.
REvil can also allegedly hijack chats with victims and cut off discussions with its affiliates in
order to collect full shares of the ransom without sharing the proceeds.
The subsequent fallout within the threat actor community offers the very organizations and
individuals they target a window into the types of important chatter that can arise in the
cybercriminal underground; insights into evolving relationships and behavioral codes among
threat actors; and lens into whether arbitration is a realistic and viable possibility when
dealing with major ransomware groups.

Making sense of the chatter
The threat actor Signature—who had previously requested US $7 million in an arbitration
dispute on Exploit—re-hashed their argument after the REvil backdoor was revealed.
As a result, Signature started a new Exploit thread, saying that they knew all along about
REvil’s scamming tactics and claiming the revelations lend credence to Signature’s
arbitration claim. With the revelation of the parallel chat and the code backdoor, it is possible
that an REvil operator had logged into the Signature chat posing as the victim company and
abruptly ended the negotiations to collect all the ransom on their parallel chat, just as
Signature alleged in May.

LockBitSupp, the LockBit ransomware representative on Exploit, chimed in to say that many
REvil affiliates share suspicion towards REvil.
Some illicit community members reacted with derision to the new evidence presented
against REvil, pointing to a greater internal fissure growing between groups of affiliated
threat actors.

One Exploit user said that this is the first time the are hearing of major ransomware groups
stealing profits from their alleged partners. The user compared REvil’s behavior to scamming
methods used by low level carders.
Another Exploit user said they were tired of “lousy partner programs” used by ransomware
collectives “you cannot trust” and further speculated that REvil would survive and thrive
regardless of whether their reputation takes a real hit among fellow threat actors.
Cybersecurity analysts at Flashpoint note that animosity towards ransomware-involved threat
actors has been ongoing since high-profile ransomware attacks caused increased law
enforcement scrutiny toward cybercriminal communities.

Arbitration
Other users have also expressed pessimism regarding the underground community’s ability
to handle REvil’s alleged behavior. One threat actor on XSS said that “the Devil himself will
not be able to figure out” arbitration cases against REvil since the matter has gotten too
complicated—and that arbitration might be prohibited anyway because some forums have
purportedly instituted a ransomware ban.
Another threat actor echoed these sentiments that opening up arbitration cases against REvil
would be useless, like “arbitrat[ing] against Stalin.”

Reduce ransomware risk and see Flashpoint intelligence in action
When organizations, such as financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, gain
insight into the operational dynamics of malicious cybercriminal communities, they can better
understand threat actor TTPs; access potentially vital observations in real-time; leverage that
information to thwart a ransomware attack.

actionable threat intelligence you and your entire team need to identify and respond to
threats targeting your organization. When equipped with Flashpoint Intelligence, your team
has immediate access to collections across illicit online communities ranging from private
forums and illicit marketplaces to encrypted chat services channels to gain insight into threatactor activity on a global scale.
