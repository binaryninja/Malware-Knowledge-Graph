Malicious actors employ a range of tools to achieve their objectives. One of the most
damaging activities an actor pursues is the theft of authentication information, whether it
applies to business or personal accounts. Unless specifically mitigated, this theft often allows
an unauthorized actor to masquerade as the victim, either achieving immediate gains or
creating a platform from which progressive attack campaigns may launch.
There are a number of threats that endanger the critical secrecy of credentials, including
poor operational security practices, social engineering, man-in-the-middle attacks, password
hash dumping and cracking, and surveillance malware. In this post, Unit 42 examines
various trends in a malware threat set within the surveillance malware category: Predator
Pain and its latest derivative, HawkEye.

Threat Background
Surveillance malware covers a broad range of capabilities, including:
Capture of keyboard and / or input device (e.g., mouse) activity, with window / process
awareness (keylogging)
Taking asset display screen shots or video (display capturing)
Assuming control of cameras and / or microphones attached to an asset (live
surveillance)
Interception of network communications (sniffing)
Each of these capabilities can be qualified by its scope (i.e., types of information collected)
and method (ranging in techniques and sophistication). Additionally, some surveillance
software includes its own exfiltration mechanism, while others may depend on external
software to accomplish the transfer of captured information.

Both Predator Pain and HawkEye are considered keyloggers, but they also include
additional features, such as web browser and e-mail client credential dumping, display
capture, and captured information exfiltration. HawkEye is openly sold on a commercial
website, whereas Predator Pain is usually acquired through underground forums. Associated
features have made this set of malware popular with malicious actors across a number of
motivations; however, the most prevalent motivation remains cyber crime, in which stolen
information is directly exploited or sold for financial gain. (A list of additional reading links is
found at the end of this blog post for anyone interested in learning more about this specific
threat set.)

Trending and Analysis: July 2015-September 2015
The following sections describe Predator Pain and HawkEye trending and analysis
conducted by Unit 42 from July 2015 through September 2015. We leveraged the Palo Alto
Networks AutoFocus service, under which this threat set is tagged as PredatorPain.

Target Selection
Almost all of the adversaries Unit 42 observed employing this malware threat set harvest
publicly disclosed or leaked e-mail addresses to construct phishing campaign targeting lists.
These lists are mostly indiscriminant, with malicious actors seeking any opportunistic gains
they can glean from “shotgun” style attack campaigns. The natural exposure of businesses
with publicly advertised e-mail addresses (e.g., sales@<domain> or info@<domain>) makes
for easy targeting of what typically represents key organizational e-mail distributions. In other
words, these distributions normally reach a number of staff at the target organization who are
motivated by their importance to business, increasing the likelihood of them inadvertently
executing malicious code on their systems.

Threat Volume
Figure 1 depicts July to September 2015 sessions (individual occurrences) for this threat set.

2/9

Figure 1: Predator Pain / HawkEye Sessions, Jul - Sep 2015
Observed sessions revealed an interesting pattern in distribution volume ramping up on
Sunday for peaks over Monday through Wednesday, with significant volume dropping from
Thursday onward. We believe this corresponds with focused business targeting early in the
workweek, per the previously noted targeting process employed by most cyber crime actors.

Delivery
Figure 2 shows the delivery methods observed for the Predator Pain and HawkEye threat set
over the period of interest, with e-mail by far being the preferred delivery method for
adversaries.

Exploring respective phishing attacks further revealed the following lure themes:
Notification or issues with product order or shipping
Notification or issues with payment, purchase order, invoice, or billing
Product or service quotation request
Confusing, random, and/or purportedly personal topics

4/9

Respective malware delivered via malicious e-mail mainly consisted of Microsoft Windows
Portable Executable (PE) 32-bit and 64-bit binaries. Microsoft Word or RTF documents
constituted the remainder of malicious files. Attempted downloads of this threat from web
and FTP sites were also observed; however, these represented drastically lower occurrences
(session counts).

Observed Targeting
With these distribution methods in mind, Figure 3 shows an AutoFocus visualization for the
80 countries Unit 42 observed as targeted by the Predator Pain and Hawkeye threat set
during the noted time period.

Figure 3: AutoFocus view of Predator Pain / HawkEye targeted countries, Jul - Sep 2015
Not surprisingly, the top-ten list of most highly targeted countries includes 7 of the 23
wealthiest in the world, based on GDP per capita:
United States
Australia
Canada
Thailand
Taiwan ROC
Kuwait
Japan
Spain
Italy
Sweden
The top ten targeted industries accounted for 82% of sessions:

5/9

High Tech
Higher Education
Manufacturing
Professional and Legal Services
Transportation and Logistics
Wholesale and Retail
Construction
Media and Entertainment
Telecommunications
Government
We suggest three reasons based on this combination of observed countries and industries
targeted:
Innovative organizations are prime targets for a number of adversary motivations due
to the capabilities and intellectual capital they aggregate.
Service oriented businesses, striving to develop customer relationships are more likely
to fall victim to phishing attacks due to both organizational culture and incentives for
client and customer engagement.
Natural target saturation occurs within countries with established or thriving
infrastructure, enabling malicious actors to reach a broader range of targets remotely
through technology.

Prevalent Malware Capabilities
The Predator Pain and HawkEye set of malware is feature rich, compared to most other
keyloggers. The following are the capabilities Unit 42 observed as most often enabled for this
threat set during the focal time period (ordered by prevalence):
E-mail client credential dump
Web browser credential dump
Collection of system configuration information
Logging of web browser activity
Logging of e-mail activity
Screenshot grabbing

Exfiltration Method Break-Out
This threat set includes three main methods of exfiltration: E-mail, PHP-based Web Panel,
and FTP. Figure 4 shows the HawkEye keylogger’s settings page, where the method
employed by an instance can be specified.

Conclusion
Prevention is the best strategy when it comes to the threat posed by keyloggers, such as the
Predator Pain and HawkEye set. System hardening, integrity assurance, software version
and patch management, and user awareness are just the first steps towards threat
mitigation.
Recommendations to protection against this class of threat include:
Employ multi-factor authentication: Knowledge-based authentication relies on the
secrecy of information. Including elements of what you have (i.e., hardware token) or
what you are (i.e., biometrics) can reduce the value of respective stolen credentials for
an adversary if that information only satisfies one level in the authentication process.
Limit the impact of stolen credential information: Don’t share credentials across
accounts and change those credentials periodically. Adversaries commonly engage in
activities such as credential stuffing in an attempt to maximize benefits of stolen
credentials.
Maximize network control and visibility: The latest Verizon DBIR included the
finding that in over 25% of breaches, the organization was notified of the breach
through a third party. Inbound, outbound, and internal network traffic needs to be
controlled and monitored. This is also useful for disrupting malware C2 and exfiltration
channels.

8/9

Integrate anti-malware automated dynamic analysis (e.g., sandboxing): Identify
previously unknown threats before they become much larger problems on the network.
Given the anti-detection tools at the disposal of adversaries, this is a modern necessity.
Implement network segmentation: Avoid flat networks, where once an adversary is
in they have unrestricted access to internal resources. Network segmentation is a best
practice for exposing only enough information as is required for specific organizational
processes, moving toward a “zero trust” model. In this context, it is about further
limiting the access of an adversary should they successful compromise credentials.
