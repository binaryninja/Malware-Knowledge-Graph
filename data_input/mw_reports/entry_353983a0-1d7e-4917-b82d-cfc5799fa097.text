Top 10 Malware March 2022
cisecurity.org/insights/blog/top-10-malware-march-2022
April 15, 2022

In March 2022, the Top 10 stayed consistent with the previous month with malware changing
spots in the Top 10. This is with the exception of Gh0st and Jupyter, both returning to the Top
10. Gh0st is a RAT used to control infected endpoints. Gh0st is dropped by other malware to
create a backdoor into a device that allows an attacker to fully control the infected device.
Jupyter, aka SolarMarker, is a highly evasive and adaptive .NET infostealer that is
downloaded by leveraging SEO-poisoning to create watering hole sites for the purpose of
deceiving unsuspecting users who visit the website and download a malicious document,
often a zip or PDF file embedded with a malicious executable. The Top 10 Malware variants
comprise 76% of the total malware activity in March 2022, increasing 4% from February
2022.

Malware Infection Vectors
The MS-ISAC tracks potential primary infection vectors for our Top 10 Malware each month
based on open-source reporting, as depicted in the graph below. We currently track four
initial infection vectors: Dropped, Malvertisement, Malspam, and Network. The MS-ISAC has
not had any malware in the Top 10 use the initial infection vector Network in the past year.
Some malware employ different vectors in different contexts and are thus tracked as
Multiple.
In March 2022, Malvertisement accounted for the greatest number of alerts. Malvertisement
remains the top initial infection vector due to Shlayer activity. Activity levels for
Malvertisement, and Multiple decreased, while activity for Dropped and Malspam increased.
It is likely that Malvertisement will remain the primary infection vector as the Shlayer
campaign continues. The Multiple category increases and decreases at an unpredictable
rate, which making it difficult to analyze trends. This category will likely continue to comprise
a significant portion of the initial infection vectors as malware becomes more sophisticated
2/6

and employs multiple methods to infect systems. Malspam consistently represents a portion
of the Top 10 malware as it is one of the oldest and most reliable primary initial infection
vectors used by cyber threat actors in both this category and the Multiple category.

Dropped – Malware delivered by other malware already on the system, an exploit kit,
infected third-party software, or manually by a cyber threat actor. Currently, Gh0st, Jupyter,
and Mirai are the malware using this technique.
Multiple – Malware that currently favors at least two vectors. Currently, Arechclient2,
CoinMiner, Delf, and ZeuS are the malware utilizing multiple vectors.
Malspam – Unsolicited emails either direct users to malicious web sites or trick users into
downloading or opening malware. Top 10 Malware using this technique include Agent Tesla
and NanoCore.
Malvertisement – Malware introduced through malicious advertisements. Currently, Shlayer
is the only Top 10 Malware using this technique.

Top 10 Malware and IOCs
Below are the Top 10 Malware ranked in order of prevalence. The respective indicators of
compromise (IOCs) are provided to aid in detecting and preventing infections from these Top
10 Malware variants. Note: The associated URIs are aligned with malware’s respective
domain(s) or IP(s) and increase the likelihood of maliciousness when found together. The
URIs alone are not inherently malicious.

1. Shlayer

3/6

Shlayer is a downloader and dropper for MacOS malware. It is primarily distributed through
malicious websites, hijacked domains, and malvertizing posing as a fake Adobe Flash
updater.
All Shlayer domains follow the same pattern <api.random_name.com>. Below area several
examples of domains Shlayer uses.</api.random_name.com>
Domains
api[.]interfacecache[.]com
api[.]scalableunit[.]com
api[.]typicalconfig[.]com
api[.]standartanalog[.]com
api[.]fieldenumerator[.]com
api[.]practicalsprint[.]com
api[.]searchwebsvc[.]com
api[.]connectedtask[.]com
api[.]navigationbuffer[.]com
api[.]windowtask[.]com

2. ZeuS
ZeuS is a modular banking trojan which uses keystroke logging to compromise victim
credentials when the user visits a banking website. Since the release of the ZeuS source
code in 2011, many other malware variants have adopted parts of its codebase, which
means that events classified as ZeuS may actually be other malware using parts of the ZeuS
code.

3. Agent Tesla
Agent Tesla is a RAT that exfiltrate credentials, log keystrokes, and capture screenshots from
an infected computer.

4. NanoCore
NanoCore is a RAT spread via malspam as a malicious Excel XLS spreadsheet. As a RAT,
NanoCore can accept commands to download and execute files, visit websites, and add
registry keys for persistence.

5. CoinMiner
CoinMiner is a cryptocurrency miner family that typically uses Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) and EternalBlue to spread across a network. Additionally, it typically
uses the WMI Standard Event Consumer scripting to execute scripts for persistence.

4/6

However, due to multiple variants of this malware, capabilities may vary. CoinMiner spreads
through malspam or is dropped by other malware.

6. Delf
Delf is a family of malware with multiple variants written in the Delphi programming language,
where most are downloaders. Campaigns, targets, infection vectors and capabilities vary
based on the variant. Delf has multiple initial infection vectors, such as: dropped, malspam,
or unintentional downloaded from a malicious website. Some of the abilities Delf variants
exhibit include: backdoor or proxy functionality, stealing information, terminating antivirus
applications, and mass mailing.

7. Gh0st
Gh0st is a RAT used to control infected endpoints. Gh0st is dropped by other malware to
create a backdoor into a device that allows an attacker to fully control the infected device.

8. Jupyter
Jupyter aka SolarMarker, is a highly evasive and adaptive .NET infostealer that is
downloaded by leveraging SEO-poisoning to create watering hole sites for the purpose of
deceiving unsuspecting users to visit the website and download a malicious document, often
a zip or PDF file embedded with a malicious executable. Jupyter primarily targets browser
data in browsers such as Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox and has full backdoor functionality.

9. Arechclient2
Arechclient2, aka SectopRAT, is a .NET RAT with numerous capabilities including multiple
stealth functions. Arechclient2 can profile victim systems, steal information such as browser
and crypto-wallet data, and launch a hidden secondary desktop to control browser sessions.
Additionally, it has several anti-VM and anti-emulator capabilities.

10. Mirai
5/6

Mirai is a malware botnet known to compromise Internet of Things (IoT) devices in order to
conduct large-scale DDoS attacks. Mirai is dropped after an exploit has allowed the attacker
to gain access to a machine.
