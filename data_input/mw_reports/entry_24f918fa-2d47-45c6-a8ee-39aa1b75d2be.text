Executive Summary
On Sunday, Dec. 13, FireEye released information related to a breach and data exfiltration originating from an unknown
actor FireEye is calling UNC2452. Unit 42 tracks this and related activity as the group named SolarStorm, and has
published an ATOM containing the observed techniques, IOCs and relevant courses of action in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.
According to FireEye, SolarStorm has compromised organizations across the globe via a supply chain attack that consists of
a trojanized update file for the SolarWinds Orion Platform.
FireEye’s blog, “Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with
SUNBURST Backdoor,” contains a wealth of useful information, all of which has been analyzed by Unit 42 researchers to
help ensure Palo Alto Networks customers are protected.

Any organization utilizing SolarWinds Orion IT management software is potentially at risk from this threat. These
organizations should immediately identify Orion systems in their network, determine if they are compromised with the
SUNBURST backdoor and seek out further evidence of compromise. Instructions on how to perform these tasks using the
Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall, Cortex XDR and XSOAR are available in this report, as well as additional
resources and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Palo Alto Networks has also launched SolarStorm Rapid Response
Programs.

The details of this attack and its impact continue to evolve. We will update this report with new details as they become
available.

What’s Known About SolarStorm and SUNBURST
SolarStorm specifically targeted supply chains during their attack on SolarWinds’ Orion IT performance and statistics
monitoring software.
SolarStorm is a highly skilled threat actor, with a significant operational security mindset, as can be observed in its
post-exploitation activity.
SolarWinds recently filed an SEC report indicating that, while they have over 300,000 customers, fewer than 18,000
customers were running the trojanized version of the Orion software.
SolarStorm threat actors created a legitimate digitally signed backdoor, SUNBURST, as a trojanized version of a
SolarWinds Orion plug-in. The trojanized software acts as a powerful supply chain infiltration mechanism for delivery.
SUNBURST has been observed delivering multiple payloads, mostly focused on memory-only droppers, such as the
FireEye-dubbed TEARDROP and Cobalt Strike BEACON.
SUNBURST’s command and control (C2) traffic masquerades as legitimate Orion Improvement Program traffic.
FireEye has released signatures and specific indicators to help identify SolarStorm’s activity.
FireEye’s research has been a cornerstone in providing not only useful signatures, but also indicators which help with
tracking and hunting for SolarStorm activity. A synopsis of those indicators is included below.
SUNBURST
At the time of this publication, the Windows Installer Patch file including the trojanized version of the SolarWinds Orion
product was still reachable:
Filename: SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp
SHA256: d0d626deb3f9484e649294a8dfa814c5568f846d5aa02d4cdad5d041a29d5600
This installer contains:
Legitimate SolarWinds Orion update components.
A digitally signed SUNBURST backdoor, and its legitimate configuration file:

TEARDROP
SUNBURST deployed several different payloads, and in at least one instance, a memory-only dropper FireEye dubbed
TEARDROP to deploy a Cobalt Strike BEACON. During analysis of the information available, Unit 42 identified related
activity involving TEARDROP malware that was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. This sample contains
a beacon request to the previously unreported domain mobilnweb[.]com.
The TEARDROP DLL has a SHA256 of: 118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51
and contains a beacon request for the URI /2019/Person-With-Parnters-Brands-Our/ with the User-Agent Mozilla/5.0
(Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36. Within
that same configuration, we also observed an additional URI setting containing the string /2019/This-Person-Two-JoinWith/.
