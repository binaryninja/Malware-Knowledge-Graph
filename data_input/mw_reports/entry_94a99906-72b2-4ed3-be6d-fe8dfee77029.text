2015: THE MOST PROLIFIC
YEAR IN HISTORY FOR OS X
MALWARE
After a 10-week analysis, the Bit9 + Carbon Black
Threat Research team found that five times more
OS X malware appeared in 2015 than during the
previous five years combined.

Threat Research Briefing
It’s been long believed that Macs have faced significantly less risk of cyber attack than PCs and, until
recently, that sentiment has been largely correct. Mac users have been mostly immune from malware
relative to their Windows-user counterparts. However, it appears that tide is turning.
This rise in Mac OS X malware comes after several years of rapid OS X market share gains, with 16.4
percent of the market now running OS X1, including expanding deployment in the enterprise. This
represents a growing attack surface for sensitive data, as 45 percent of companies now offer Macs as an
option to their employees. 2
In 2015 we have seen interesting OS X vulnerabilities and malware that have grabbed the security
community's attention. One example is XcodeGhost, which inserts malicious components into
applications made with Xcode (Apple's official tool for developing IOS and OS Apps). Additionally, it was
recently revealed that OS X El Capitan, which launched in September, contains serious vulnerabilities in
its Gatekeeper and Keychain features.
Evidence of a more malicious OS X marketplace is clearly compounding. A timeline charting Mac OS X
malware prevalence in the market shows a clear upward tick:

A 10-week analysis conducted by the Bit9 + Carbon Black Research Team validates the unprecedented
growth in OS X malware. With an extensive global reach and a pulse on the expanding threat landscape,
the Bit9 + Carbon Black team collected more than 1,400 unique OS X malware samples. Samples were
aggregated from the team’s independent research efforts, open sources, experience from incident
response engagements involving OS X, peer research, black lists, and contagio malware dump, among
other sources.
As big-picture trends from the data began to emerge, one data point struck the team as particularly
noteworthy: 2015 has been the most prolific year in history for OS X malware.
In 2015 alone, the research found, the number of OS X malware samples has been five times greater
than in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 combined.

The sample size in this analysis is significant enough for even the most optimistic Mac user to realize
that OS X security must now be a paramount concern.
Based on the observations in the 10-week analysis, the Bit9 + Carbon Black Threat Research Team
confidently expects Mac OS X malware attacks to accelerate in the coming months. As Apple continues
its growth in both the consumer and enterprise markets, its platforms have become a prime target for
attackers.

“The Bit9 + Carbon Black Threat
Research Team confidently expects
Mac OS X malware attacks to
accelerate in the coming months.”

Security professionals, consumers and enterprise users alike
should read the results of this latest analysis as a clarion call
for a more comprehensive approach to enterprise security—
one that encompasses the right people, processes and
technology that can handle advanced threats against Mac OS
X and other Apple devices.

Observed Malware Behavior
The OS X malware analyzed consisted of more than 1,400 unique samples taken from the Bit9 + Carbon
Black Threat Research Team’s research engagements, open sources, and from incident response
engagements involving OS X, peer research, black lists, and contagio malware dump.
When looking at OS X malware, research teams cannot utilize common Windows malware analysis tools,
such as process monitor. To compensate for this in their OS X research, the Bit9 + Carbon Black Threat
Research Team utilized various custom and prebuilt tools, such as fs_usage, dtrace, and opensnoop to
instrument machines for dynamic analysis, in addition to the custom-built Carbon Black sandbox.
By utilizing the custom-built sandbox, the research team was able to quickly identify common actions
performed by malware, such as file creations and network communications. This enabled the team to
look at command-and-control infrastructure as well as artifacts left as part of the malware execution.

UNIX Persistence Mechanisms Not Seen
In an interesting twist, typical UNIX persistence mechanisms were not frequently seen in the OS X
malware analyzed. For example, the team’s analysis found that mechanisms such as adding cron jobs
and “trojaning” startup locations such as rc.common weren’t typically used; instead, malware authors
are choosing to use Mac OS X-specific mechanisms.

During analysis, the team found that most OS X malware would utilize features of the OS such as
LaunchDaemons/LaunchAgents, login items and browser plugins. Malware more often resided in userland and leveraged persistence mechanisms that supported this as opposed to attempting to reside in
kernel-land by writing custom kernel extensions.
In another twist, it was the team’s expectation that, given OS X’s roots in FreeBSD, adapting Unix/Linux
malware would be common. However, based on this 10-week analysis, there does not appear to be
much, if any, Unix-style malware brought over to OS X.
Additionally, Apple introduced a new load command (LC_MAIN) to define the entry point into the MachO format with the release of OS X 10.8 in 2012. The previous load commands were LC_THREAD and
LC_UNIXTHREAD. More than 90 percent of the OS X malware we analyzed from 2015 still uses the old
load command entry point method. In analyzing samples from 2010 through 2015, the research team
did not start seeing the new method being used until 2014 and, even then, it was a tiny percentage. This
trend leads to a statistical indicator from the research that malware currently uses the old load
command much more than the new load command. Consequently, if a Mach-O file found on a modern

Mac system uses the old load command, it’s more likely to be malware than a Mach-O file using the new
load command.

“Malware authors are not updating their
malware to conform to the latest
specifications by Apple.”

Increased Malware Prevalence,
Less Sophistication

Based on Bit9 + Carbon Black’s analysis, there are
strong signs that suggest malware authors are
seizing the opportunity to strike on the OS X
platform. The result of this transition is an increased
prevalence of OS X malware, even if it is not particularly sophisticated.
As the team noted during its analysis, OS X malware authors aren’t utilizing the Unix philosophy
combining "small, sharp tools" to achieve the desired results. The malware authors seem to have a more
“Windows-malware” (i.e. - monolithic) approach to how the malware behaves versus a composability
approach, which would take advantage of existing legitimate Unix specific OS operations as part of their
design.

7 Distinct Persistence Techniques Seen
True to form, most OS X malware leverages a persistence technique in order to remain on the targeted
system. While 13 documented persistence techniques have been identified, the Bit9 + Carbon Black
Threat Research team identified that the vast majority of OS X malware leveraged one of just seven
persistence techniques to remain active on a system.
1) LaunchAgents – An OS X-provided way to start programs on a per-user or system-wide basis

2) LaunchDaemons – An OS X-provided way to start programs on a per-user or system-wide basis,
used interchangeably with LaunchAgents
3) Cron job – Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. Cron jobs
are used to run scripts/programs periodically at fixed times, dates or intervals.
4) Login items – The method to cause programs to run when a user logs in to an OS X account.
5) Browser plugins – Code that runs in the context of a Web browser. They are known for adding
additional functionality to browsers.
6) StartupItems – Programs to run upon system startup.
7) Binary infection – When one executable modifies another so when the original executable is run
control is passed to the malicious code prior to the original code being executed.
While the Threat Research Team identified other categories that could be leveraged to gain persistence,
no malware in the wild has yet been seen or adapted to leverage them. This lack of OS X malware
biodiversity currently makes finding persistent malware infections easier than on Windows systems as
there are fewer places than need to be checked.
To aid those wishing to check their infection status, we have collected and outlined several detection
mechanisms both enterprise security teams and individual consumers can use to gain better visibility
across the expanding OS X attack surface.

Detection Mechanisms / Actions to Take for Enterprises
1 - Since OS X has until recently been largely ignored by malware and only rarely the target of advanced
cyber attacks, many enterprises have failed to implement the same safeguards and controls on OS X
devices as they have for Windows machines. As OS X malware and targeted attacks have increased, this
security gap has left many organizations exposed and unable to identify or stop infections. This reality
has been compounded by the lack of OS X support from many endpoint security vendors and is a
strategic vulnerability for organizations with large OS X deployments.
If your organization is currently running OS X, it may mean that attackers are actively exploiting and
targeting your systems. Most infections our sensors see are of the adware variety, however, we have
noticed an increase in more sophisticated malware. This risk can be managed and monitored by
deploying an enterprise-class, scalable endpoint threat detection and response solution, such as Carbon
Black.
On OS X devices, the Carbon Black agent continually records all process executions, file and system
modifications, and attempted and established network connections. It analyzes this data against the
latest threat intelligence and behavioral indicators to detect malicious activity. This information is
centrally recorded and stored to provide enterprises with a single view from which current and historical
infection status, number of devices infected, and impact can be investigated and confirmed within
seconds. High-risk organizations or systems can gain additional protection by using an application
control solution, such as the Bit9 Security Platform, which will control the execution of untrusted or
arbitrary code to dramatically reduce the risk of malware infection and halt the malware’s ability to
execute in the first place.

2 - osquery is a more comprehensive and enterprise-grade opensource tool maintained by Facebook
(https://osquery.io/). Using osquery you can conduct some monitoring and analysis based upon the
following queries.
For looking at LaunchDaemon, LaunchAgent, startup items, and login malware you can utilize the
following queries:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

select name,program,path FROM launchd;
select name,program,path FROM launchd where username = ‘root’;
select name,linked_against,path from kernel_extensions;
select name,path,type,source from from startup_items;
select * from preferences where domain = ‘loginwindow’;
select * from preferences where domain = ‘loginitems’;
select * from crontab

The picture below is an example of a system infected with the Olyx backdoor that can be seen in the
osquery of “select name,program,path FROM launchd”

A fair amount of OS X malware also interfaces with the launchd, and to do that they execute the
launchctl command to load/unload daemons and agents. Watching for this type of activity is useful as
well. To do this with osquery the queries would be:
●
●

select * from shell_history where command = “launchctl”;
select * from shell_history where command = “/bin/launchctl”;

A majority of the adware would install its own browser extensions. To look at browser extensions you
can utilize the following osqueries:
●
●

select identifier,path from safari_extensions; (mostly adware malware)
select identifier,path from chrome_extensions; (mostly adware malware)

The picture below is an example of a system infected by various pieces of adware

Detection Mechanisms for Consumers
Consumers should ensure they have an antivirus software program installed and that it is running with
the latest update. While many OS X antivirus products are only moderately effective, for consumers,
this will provide a base-level of protection. There are numerous free options available from companies
such as Avast, MalwareBytes and Sophos.
For consumers wishing to see if they have already been compromised, the following utilities are
available:
Dynamic Hijack Scanner - a simple utility that will scan your computer for applications that are either
susceptible to dylib hijacking or have been hijacked. (More here: https://objectivesee.com/products/dhs.html)

KnockKnock - uncovers persistently installed software in order to generically reveal such malware.

Research Methodology
For 10 weeks the Bit9 + Carbon Black Threat Research Team collected more than 1,400 unique OS X
malware samples aggregated from its independent research efforts, open sources, experience from
incident response engagements involving OS X, peer research, black lists, and contagio malware dumps,
among other sources. The samples were then analyzed both statically and dynamically in a custom-built
sandbox. This analysis focused on how OS X malware persists and what file system utilizations it has
seen. From that research, the team noticed a significant increase in the prevalence of OS X malware,
which was the impetus for this report.
