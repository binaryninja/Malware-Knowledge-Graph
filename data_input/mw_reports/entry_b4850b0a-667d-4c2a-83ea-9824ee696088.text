Flowspec – TA505’s bulletproof hoster of choice

Jul 15, 2020
By the Intel 471 Intelligence Analysis team.
Here at Intel 471 we spend a fair amount of time tracking malicious infrastructure providers.
In the world of cybercrime the malicious infrastructure provider, or Bulletproof Hoster
(BPH) as they are called in the underground marketplace, is a core enabling service that often
gets little attention from threat intelligence analysts. It’s difficult to quantify their impact as
it’s often spread over the activities of many different clients that are conducting activities that
range from low-level phishing to more sophisticated intrusions. Sure, IP addresses and
domains associated with badness get pushed over to the NOC/SOC, SIEM or endpoints to
protect the enterprise, but few are digging beyond the initial incident and indicators then
working up the chain to prefixes, Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) or even the
companies behind them.
As you divert your attention to the malicious infrastructure provider and move up this chain,
you’re dealing with aspects of the bad guy’s business model that are more costly to put in
place and thus change less frequently. You’re also allowing for opportunities to identify, track
and proactively block clusters of infrastructure that, while not yet used for malicious activity,
have been set aside for such badness. In this blog we’ll start with some infrastructure
suspected to be in use by TA505 and make the case for blocking the entire associated prefix
as well as using BGP announcements to monitor for future indications of infrastructure being
put in place.
Through the course of our research we’ve identified a couple of IPs addresses suspected to
have been used in secondary activity by TA505, so if you’re seeing these then it means you’ve
potentially got some big problems.
176.121.14.175
176.121.14.238

These are a bit more significant to TA505 operations than Get2 Loader malware
infrastructure, which are used early on as part of the initial infection. Get2 Loader is widely
thought to be the loader operated by TA505 early on in their intrusions. This infrastructure
will typically see more frequent turnover given its position in the chain, but the same exercise
can be done with those domains & IPs as well…and it’s worth doing.

When looking at an IP address there are few red flags that should get your attention. It’s
certainly not a perfect science, but they do offer indications you may be dealing with BPH
infrastructure set aside to support malicious activity.
1. Things to look out for include:
2. The associated company is registered to an offshore location such as Belize, Seychelles,
Panama or others;
3. The company was registered in the last 1-3 years;
4. The associated ASNs were created in the last 1-3 years;
5. There are only a small number (1 – 6) prefixes associated with the ASN;
6. The prefixes associated with the ASN are smaller (/22 to /24);
7. The ASN has a small number (1 – 2) of peers (as in BGP peering);
8. Little or no benign content is hosted within the infrastructure;
9. The organization maintains a presence in the underground marketplace…obvious
giveaway!
To give a quick and simple example we’ll start with the two IPs mentioned above as being
associated with TA505 activity. The first thing we want to understand is the smallest prefix
announcement and routing history associated with the IP address. That’s pretty easy using
RIPE’s free tool RIPEStat. The key takeaways from the screens below are that both IPs have
been part of 176.121.14.0/24 since mid-2018 and it is currently announced by AS210138.
Also, this prefix provides a fairly small number of IP addresses — 256 to be exact.

We can also use RIPEStat to understand the routing history for AS210138. This will provide
you information related to what other prefixes have been and are being announced under a
particular Autonomous System (AS). What we can see is that AS210138 has only announced
the subject /24 IPv4 prefix since October 2019 and the IPv6 /48 since in April 2020. If you
were confident an ASN was controlled by a malicious infrastructure provider you could make
the case for blocking any prefixes associated with it currently and in the future.

We can look further into the ASN, the parent organization, and more using the RIPE
database and other tools, but that’s beyond the scope of this blog. We’ll stick to three RIPE
objects (person, organization and ASN) that provide some pretty decent insight into the AS
and those that control it.

The information gleaned from the RIPE
DB and from RIPEStat is somewhat more
reliable than domain WHOIS as it can’t
all simply contain dummy data and some
of it is related to BGP, which needs to be
legitimate if you’re going to play on the
internet. To summarize some of the info
we’ve pulled together:
Both IPs are part of 176.121.14.0/24,
which is a relatively small netblock of 256 IP addresses
The prefix falls under ASN 210138, which was created on Oct 2, 2019
The AS first announced 176.121.14.0/24 on Oct 12, 2019
The prefix and ASN are associated with a company called Flowspec LTD

Next, we consider the question of whether or
not this particular organization is catering
its services to cybercriminals directly in the
underground marketplace. A quick look
across a number of forums will show that
Flowspec is operating in plain sight and
clearly offering bulletproof hosting services.
It’s not always this easy to answer this
question, however.

We’ve taken an abbreviated look at Flowspec’s setup, but what we can conclude is that TA505
are likely active in the underground marketplace and using the BPH services of Flowspec. It’s
a safe bet to also conclude that nothing good is coming out of Flowspec’s /24 and it’s more or
less set aside for nefarious activity. TA505, a somewhat sophisticated adversary, are just one
of a number of clients so to block that /24 will also help defend against any other badness
originating from Flowspec.

So what can we do about it?
Course of action (COA) analysis must take into account your organization’s capabilities, but
below are a number of simple COAs that might make this sort of research and analysis
actionable for your organization.
6/7

1. Block/alert on all 256 IPs associated with 176.121.14.0/24. The prefix is owned and
operated by a known BPH service. One of the service’s clients is TA505. Better yet,
blacklist the ASN and any prefixes associated with it.
2. Monitor the 176.121.14.0/24 for BGP announcements that would suggest it is being
removed from Flowspec or moved to another entity. This could indicate the prefix is no
longer used as part of the BPH service or has been transferred to a new entity under the
service’s control.
3. Monitor BGP announcements for Flowspec’s ASN to identify new prefixes being added
so you can immediately block/alert on them.
