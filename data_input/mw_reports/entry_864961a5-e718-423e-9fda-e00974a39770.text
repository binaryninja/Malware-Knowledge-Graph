Executive Summary
Unit 42 recently observed a polyglot Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file being
employed in the infection process used by the information stealer IcedID. We will show how
to analyze the polyglot CHM file and the final payload so you can understand how the
sample evades detection.
Multiple attack groups such as Starchy Taurus (aka APT41) and Evasive Serpens (formerly
tracked as OilRig, also known as Europium) have abused CHM files to conceal payloads
written using PowerShell or JavaScript. Here, we describe an interesting attack that allows

1/8

attackers to avoid the need for long lines of code, which can make it easier for malicious files
to evade detection by security products. Polyglot files can be abused by attackers to hide
from anti-malware systems that rely on file format identification. The technique involves
executing the same CHM file twice in the infection process. The first execution exhibits
benign activities, while the second execution stealthily carries out malicious behaviors.
This particular attack chain was discovered in early August 2022 and delivered IcedID, also
known as Bokbot, as the final payload. This information stealer, IcedID, is well-known
malware that has been attacking users since 2019.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from malware families using similar antianalysis techniques with Cortex XDR or the Next-Generation Firewall with cloud-delivered
security services including WildFire, Advanced Threat Prevention, Advanced URL Filtering
and DNS Security.

Malicious Polyglot CHM File
Polyglot files are binaries that have multiple different file format types. The file would have a
different behavior depending on the application that was used to execute it.
The attack that was discovered in early August 2022 starts with a phishing email that
includes an attached zip file named erosstrucking-file-08.08.2022.zip. The zip file
decompresses into an ISO image file named order-130722.28554.iso. Inside the ISO file is a
CHM file called pss10r.chm (SHA256:
3d279aa8f56e468a014a916362540975958b9e9172d658eb57065a8a230632fa). The
polyglot CHM file is used to display help documentation. When the user launches the CHM
file (pss10r.chm), a harmless help window is displayed.

To dump the contents of the CHM file, we used 7zip. The file of interest is
PSSXMicrosoftSupportServices_HP05221271.htm.

Figure 2. Contents of

the decoy HTML help window.
Most of the code in the HTML file is used for generating the decoy window. However,
concealed within the HTML code is a single-line command to execute the same CHM file
again. The command calls Mshta.exe to execute itself (pss10r.chm) a second time.
Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) files. HTAs are fullfledged applications created using HTML.

Mshta.exe to execute the CHM file a second time.
The code of the HTA is buried within the binary of the CHM file and configured to be invisible
to the victim during execution. The HTA is used to execute the binary app.dll.

The binary app.dll is actually hidden within the ISO image. The hidden binary can be
revealed using the attrib command.

The app.dll binary is a 64-bit IcedID DLL. (SHA256:

IcedID DLL’s Configuration Extraction
To retrieve the indicators of compromise (IoCs) from the IcedID DLL, we looked at its
configuration. The IcedID DLL’s configuration is encoded and stored in the data section of
the binary. The encoded configuration has the format shown in Figure 6.

The following function would decode the IcedID DLL’s configuration at runtime. The address
of the encoded configuration (enc_config) is in the function.

Conclusion
Threat actors continue to evolve their techniques to evade detection. The above analysis
demonstrates how attackers abused a polyglot Microsoft Compiled HTML file to deliver an
IcedID payload. It is important for defenders not to trust binaries based on their file types
since polyglot files such as the one discussed here have more than one correct file type.
