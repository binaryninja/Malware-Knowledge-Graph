ORACLE MICROS COMPROMISE NOTIFICATION
Distribution: Issuers, Acquirers, Processors and Merchants
Summary: On Monday, 8 August 2016, Oracle Security informed Oracle MICROS customers that it had
detected malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems. Oracle is currently investigating the
compromise, and as of 12 August 2016, the company has not published details about the cause/s.
Visa is issuing this alert to provide indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with cybercrime threats
known to have previously targeted Oracle systems.
About Oracle MICROS
Oracle MICROS offers a range of software, hardware and related services, including point-of-sale systems
(POS) along cloud solutions to manage hotels, food and beverage facilities, and retailers. According to
Oracle Micros, MICROS' technologies are in use across 330,000 customer sites in 180 countries.
Oracle Customer Notification
According to media sources, Oracle Security provided a notification to Oracle MICROS customers on 8
August 2016, informing them of the following:
 Oracle Security has detected and addressed malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems
 Oracle has confirmed that it's investigating a breach of its Micros division.
 Oracle's own systems, corporate network, and other cloud and service offers were not impacted.
 Oracle MICROS users will have to change their account passwords immediately
 The company reportedly stated that payment data was not at risk, as that information is
encrypted both at rest and in transit in the MICROS environment.
Although Oracle has not provided additional details on the exact date or extent of the breach of Oracle
MICROS, some media reports suggest that the support portal for MICROS clients was also compromised.

1. Cybercrime threats to Oracle MICROS
Visa is aware of two cybercrime threats, “Carbanak” and “MalumPOS”, which have previously targeted
Oracle systems. Indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with both Carbanak and MalumPOS are
provided in section two [2] of this report.

Carbanak
On 8 August 2016, a media source reported that the “Oracle’s MICROS customer support portal was seen
communicating with a server known to be used by the “Carbanak.”
According to Kaspersky Lab, in February 2015, the Carbanak group used techniques commonly seen in
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) incidents to successfully target one financial institution’s (a bank) money
processing services, Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and financial accounts. In some cases, Oracle
1

databases were manipulated to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer
money between accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to dispense
cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready to collect it as part of this
operation.
In March 2015, Visa provided an industry-wide public alert and mitigation guidance concerning Carbanak.
Visa recommends that all financial institutions and retailers scan their networks for the presence of
Carbanak. If detected, please contact law enforcement immediately and activate security incident
procedures.

MalumPOS
Discovered by TrendMicro in 2015, MalumPOS is known to specifically target Oracle MICROS point-ofsale devices. MalumPOS is described as simple and non-obfuscated malware, written in the Delphi
programming language. Visa is aware that MalumPOS is still actively used by cyber criminals.

2. Mitigation action recommended for Oracle Micros Customers





Change passwords for any account used by a MICROS representative to access the customer’s
on-premises systems.
Scan network for the following:
– Psexec file
– Files with .bin extension (located in \All users\%AppData%\Mozilla\ or
c:\ProgramData\Mozilla\)
– Svchost.exe file (located in Windows\System32\com\catalogue\)
– Svchost.exefile (located in C:\ProgramData\Mozilla\svchost.exe)
 This file provided remote access functions, such as the ability to execute arbitrary
commands, upload/download files.
– Operating system (Windows) running services ending in “sys”
Scan networks for IOCs linked to Carbanak:

Additionally, Visa recommends the following best practices to reduce the risk of exposure:
– Educate employees how to avoid phishing scams and opening emails with attachments
– Maintain updates for all software and patches (address zero day vulnerabilities)
– Turn on heuristics (behavioral analysis) on anti-malware to search for suspicious behavior

Visa will continue to report any mitigation guidance, technical indicators of compromise associated with
this compromise, or additional details on the overall extent of the compromise as details are made
available.
