Article updated on 2/6/23 with additional information and updated statistics.
Admins, hosting providers, and the French Computer Emergency Response Team (CERTFR) warn that attackers actively target VMware ESXi servers unpatched against a two-yearold remote code execution vulnerability to deploy a new ESXiArgs ransomware.
Tracked as CVE-2021-21974, the security flaw is caused by a heap overflow issue in the
OpenSLP service that can be exploited by unauthenticated threat actors in low-complexity
attacks.
"As current investigations, these attack campaigns appear to be exploiting the vulnerability
CVE-2021-21974, for which a patch has been available since 23 February 2021," CERT-FR
said.
"The systems currently targeted would be ESXi hypervisors in version 6.x and prior to 6.7."

To block incoming attacks, admins have to disable the vulnerable Service Location Protocol
(SLP) service on ESXi hypervisors that haven't yet been updated.
CERT-FR strongly recommends applying the patch as soon as possible but adds that
systems left unpatched should also be scanned to look for signs of compromise.
CVE-2021-21974 affects the following systems:
ESXi versions 7.x prior to ESXi70U1c-17325551
ESXi versions 6.7.x prior to ESXi670-202102401-SG
ESXi versions 6.5.x prior to ESXi650-202102101-SG

â€‹ rench cloud provider OVHcloud first published a report linking this massive wave of attacks
F
targeting VMware ESXi servers with the Nevada ransomware operation.
"According to experts from the ecosystem as well as autorities, they might be related to
Nevada ransomware and are using CVE-2021-21974 as compromission vector. Investigation
are still ongoing to confirm those assumptions," OVHcloud CISO Julien Levrard said.
"The attack is primarily targetting ESXi servers in version before 7.0 U3i, apparently through
the OpenSLP port (427)."
However, the company backtracked soon after our story was released, saying they attributed
it to the wrong ransomware operation.
At the end of the first day of attacks, approximately 120 ESXi servers were encrypted.
However, the numbers quickly grew over the weekend, with 2,400 VMware ESXi devices
worldwide currently detected as compromised in the ransomware campaign, according to
a Censys search.

In an advisory published on February 6th, VMware confirmed that this attack exploits older
ESXi flaws and not a zero-day vulnerability.
The company advises admins to install the latest updates for ESXi servers and disable the
OpenSLP service, which has been disabled by default since 2021.
Some admins breached in this attack said they did not have SLP enabled [1, 2], adding
further confusion as to how servers were breached.
Overall, the ransomware campaign has not seen much success considering the large
number of encrypted devices, with the Ransomwhere ransom payment tracking
service reporting only four ransom payments for a total of $88,000.
The lack of ransom payments is likely due to a VMware ESXi recovery guide created by
security researcher Enes Sonmez, allowing many admins to rebuild their virtual machines
and recover their data for free.

New ESXiArgs ransomware
However, from the ransom notes seen in this attack, they do not appear to be related to the
Nevada Ransomware, and appear to be from a new ransomware family.
Starting roughly four hours ago, victims impacted by this campaign have also begun
reporting the attacks on BleepingComputer's forum, asking for help and more information on
how to recover their data.
The ransomware encrypts files with the .vmxf, .vmx, .vmdk, .vmsd, and .nvram extensions on
compromised ESXi servers and creates a .args file for each encrypted document with
metadata (likely needed for decryption).
While the threat actors behind this attack claim to have stolen data, one victim reported in
the BleepingComputer forums that it was not the case in their incident.
"Our investigation has determined that data has not been infiltrated. In our case, the attacked
machine had over 500 GB of data but typical daily usage of only 2 Mbps. We reviewed traffic
stats for the last 90 days and found no evidence of outbound data transfer," the admin said.
Victims have also found ransom notes named "ransom.html" and "How to Restore Your
Files.html" on locked systems. Others said that their notes are plaintext files.

ESXiArgs ransom note (BleepingComputer)
ID Ransomware's Michael Gillespie is currently tracking the ransomware under the name
'ESXiArgs,' but told BleepingComputer that until we can find a sample, there is no way to
determine if it has any weaknesses in the encryption.
BleepingComputer has a dedicated ESXiArgs support topic where people are reporting their
experiences with this attack and receiving help recovering machines.

ESXiArgs technical details
Last night, an admin retrieved a copy of the ESXiArgs encryptor and associated shell script
and shared it in the BleepingComputer support topic.
Analyzing the script and the encryptor has allowed us to understand better how these attacks
were conducted.
When the server is breached, the following files are stored in the /tmp folder:
encrypt - The encryptor ELF executable.
encrypt.sh - A shell script that acts as the logic for the attack, performing various tasks
before executing the encryptor, as described below.
public.pem - A public RSA key used to encrypt the key that encrypts a file.

motd - The ransom note in text form that will be copied to /etc/motd so it is shown on
login. The server's original file will be copied to /etc/motd1.
index.html - The ransom note in HTML form that will replace VMware ESXi's home
page. The server's original file will be copied to index1.html in the same folder.
ID Ransomware's Michael Gillespie analyzed the encryptor and told BleepingComputer the
encryption is, unfortunately, secure, meaning no cryptography bugs allow decryption.
"The public.pem it expects is a public RSA key (my guess is RSA-2048 based on looking at
encrypted files, but the code technically accepts any valid PEM).," Gillespie posted in the
forum support topic.
"For the file to encrypt, it generates 32 bytes using OpenSSL's secure
CPRNG RAND_pseudo_bytes, and this key is then used to encrypt the file using
Sosemanuk, a secure stream cipher. The file key is encrypted with RSA
(OpenSSL's RSA_public_encrypt), and appended to the end of the file."
"The use of the Sosemanuk algorithm is rather unique, and is usually only used in
ransomware derived from the Babuk (ESXi variant) source code. This may perhaps be the
case, but they modified it to use RSA instead of Babuk's Curve25519 implementation."
This analysis indicates that ESXiArgs is likely based on leaked Babuk source code, which
has been previously used by other ESXi ransomware campaigns, such as CheersCrypt and
the Quantum/Dagon group's PrideLocker encryptor.
While the ransom note for ESXiArgs and Cheerscrypt are very similar, the encryption method
is different, making it unclear if this is a new variant or just a shared Babuk codebase.
Furthermore, this does not appear to be related to the Nevada ransomware, as previously
mentioned by OVHcloud.
The encryptor is executed by a shell script file that launches it with various command line
arguments, including the public RSA key file, the file to encrypt, the chunks of data that will
not be encrypted, the size of an encryption block, and the file size.
usage: encrypt <public_key> <file_to_encrypt> [<enc_step>] [<enc_size>] [<file_size>]
enc_step
number of MB to skip while encryption
enc_size
number of MB in encryption block
file_size file size in bytes (for sparse files)

This encryptor is launched using the encrypt.sh shell script that acts as the logic behind the
attack, which we will briefly describe below.
When launched, the script will execute the following command to modify the ESXi virtual
machine's configuration files (.vmx) so that the strings '.vmdk' and '.vswp' are changed to
'1.vmdk' and '1.vswp'.

Modifying VMX files

The script then terminates all running virtual machines by force-terminating (kill -9) all
processes containing the string 'vmx' in a similar way to this VMware support article.
The script will then use the 'esxcli storage filesystem list | grep "/vmfs/volumes/"
| awk -F' ' '{print $2}'' command to get a list of ESXi volumes.
The script will search these volumes for file's matching the following extensions:
.vmdk
.vmx
.vmxf
.vmsd
.vmsn
.vswp
.vmss
.nvram
.vmem

For each found file, the script will create a [file_name].args file in the same folder, which
contains the computed size step (shown below), '1', and the size of the file.
For example, server.vmx will have an associated server.vmx.args file.
The script will then use the 'encrypt' executable to encrypt the files based on the
computed parameters, as shown in the screenshot below.

Routine to create .args files and encrypt files
Source: BleepingComputer
After the encryption, the script will replace the ESXi index.html file and the server's motd file
with the ransom notes, as described above.
Finally, the script performs some cleanup by deleting logs, removing a Python backdoor
installed at /store/packages/vmtools.py [VirusTotal], and deleting various lines from the
following files:
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
/bin/hostd-probe.sh
/etc/vmware/rhttpproxy/endpoints.conf
/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh

7/9

Cleanup of various Linux configuration files and potential backdoor
Source: BleepingComputer
The /store/packages/vmtools.py file is the same custom Python backdoor for VMware
ESXi server discovered by Juniper in December 2022, allowing the threat actors to remotely
access the device.
All admins should check for the existence of this vmtools.py file to make sure it was
removed. If found, the file should be removed immediately.
Finally, the script executes the /sbin/auto-backup.sh to update the configuration saved in the
/bootbank/state.tgz file and starts SSH.
