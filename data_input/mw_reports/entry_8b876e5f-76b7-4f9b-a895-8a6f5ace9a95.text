Identifying Connected Infrastructure and Management Activities

Introduction

1/11

This blog post seeks to build on recent public reporting on campaigns attributed to SideCopy,
a Pakistani-linked threat group. SideCopy has been active since 2019, primarily targeting
South Asian countries, with a focus on India and Afghanistan. The group's name comes from
its use of an infection chain that mimics that of SideWinder APT, an Indian-linked threat
group.

The distinction between SideWinder and SideCopy was first made by security researcher
@Sebdraven and is documented here.

2/11

Some reports suggest that SideCopy may be a subdivision of Transparent Tribe (APT36),
with similar tactics and techniques observed.

The S2 Research Team has blogged previously on the activities of Transparent Tribe:

Transparent Tribe APT Infrastructure Mapping - Part One
Transparent Tribe APT Infrastructure Mapping - Part Two

In this post we share the discoveries of our S2 Threat Research Team after examining
analysis by the Chinese cyber security company QiAnXin, published on 20 March 2023,
which detailed a SideCopy attack chain used to deploy AllaKore RAT. AllaKore RAT is an
open-source remote access tool which has been modified for the purposes of SideCopy
operations, and is commonly observed in their intrusions.

Key Findings

Identification of additional malware samples and C2 infrastructure associated with
SideCopy targeting of the Indian Ministry of Defense
Evidence of management activity sourced from mobile IPs located in Pakistan,
centered around a key IP address (66.219.22.252) connected to SideCopy’s use of
Action RAT
Further credence provided to the assessment that SideCopy is a Pakistani-linked threat
actor group, involved state-level espionage activities

India in the Crosshairs

3/11

As discussed in the analysis by QiAnXin, spear phishing was used as the initial delivery
method for this campaign. Examining the lures involved, the targets appear to be users in
India, specifically in the Ministry of Defence.

In a bid to further understanding of this campaign, we will not seek to repeat analysis of the
infection chain. Instead we will focus on the two tools which were ultimately dropped,
examining threat telemetry surrounding their associated command and control (C2)
infrastructure.

DUser.dll (Action RAT)

4/11

The first tool, identified as Action RAT in analysis by Cyble, is dropped onto the victim
machine alongside a benign executable which is used to sideload it, in order to avoid
detection. Action RAT’s capabilities include the ability to receive commands from the C2
server, to retrieve information from the victim machine, to execute further payloads, and to
upload information back to the C2.

We found two samples of Action RAT (loaded as DUser.dll), including the sample analyzed
by Cyble.

Cyble Sample Stage 1: feeadc91373732d65883c8351a6454a77a063ff5 (DRDO - K4

(Contabo GmbH)

Sample Two Stage 1: 0d68a135b1f4be18481cf44ed02bcbf82aeb542e (Cyber

Action RAT: cb031561fd76643885671922db7d5b840060334d (DUser.dll) C2:
84.46.250.78:8080 (Contabo GmbH)

Examining threat telemetry for the two C2 IPs 144.91.72.17 and 84.46.250.78 we observed
initial victim connections on 06 February 2023 and 15 March 2023 respectively.

In total we observed 18 distinct victims, all located in India, connecting to the C2 servers highlighting the targeted nature of the campaign.

Further to this activity we also observed 37 distinct IPs (again all located in India) connecting
to 144.91.72.17:9468 in activity which commenced on 07 January 2023. Of the 37 IPs, two
were observed connecting to the Action RAT port (TCP/8080).

We were unable to identify a sample talking to TCP/9468 of 144.91.72.17, however we
would hypothesize that this IP was used for C2 communications with another tool associated
with SideCopy activities.

Management Hints?

Examining outbound activity from 144.91.72.17 and 84.46.250.78, we observed connections
from 84.46.250.78 to 66.219.22.252:82 (IMMEDION, US). Whilst 66.219.22.252 is assigned
to an American provider, WHOIS data places it in Pakistan.

Further examining connections to 66.219.22.252:82, we observed communications sourced
from 17 distinct IPs assigned to Pakistani mobile providers and four Proton VPN nodes
during the period of interest.

All of the Proton VPN nodes and all but three of the Pakistani mobile IPs were also observed
connecting to 66.219.22.252:3389 within the same time period. Port 3389 (RDP) is often
observed open on SideCopy (and Transparent Tribe) C2 servers, and is believed to be
utilized for management purposes by the threat actors.

These findings are therefore indicative of management of 66.219.22.252 by actors likely
located in Pakistan, in addition to actors unknown accessing via Proton VPN infrastructure.

Examining the communications sourced from the Pakistani mobile IPs, to 66.219.22.252:82
and 66.219.22.252:3389, we can start to build a general pattern of life, illustrated in Figure 2
below.

6/11

Figure 2: Pattern of Life for Management of 66.219.22.252

The timings in Figure 2 shown above are based on UTC, which is 5 hours behind Pakistan
Standard Time. Therefore, Figure 2 demonstrates that management of 66.219.22.252 occurs
between Monday to Saturday, from roughly 10AM to 7PM - with some exceptions on
Thursdays.

These data points are potentially indicative of the threat actors accessing their infrastructure
within a typical working week cadence, suggesting that management is undertaken
professionally.

Finally, when analyzing threat telemetry data for 66.219.22.252, we also observed inbound
connections to TCP/8080 and TCP/9467 sourced from IP addresses assigned to Indian
providers. TCP/9467 is noteworthy given its similarity to the activity observed on
7/11

144.91.72.17:9468 which we assess to be indicative of SideCopy C2 communications.

The findings in this section derived from threat telemetry data are summarized below in
Figure 2.

AllaKore RAT

According to QiAnXin’s analysis, DUser.dll is also used to load and execute a version of
AllaKore RAT, which is dropped on the victim machine via separate infrastructure. AllaKore
RAT’s capabilities include functionality which allows for keylogging, screenshotting, and
8/11

remote access of the victim machine, with an ability to also upload stolen information to the
C2 server.

We found two samples of AllaKore RAT, both of which were referenced by QiAnXin.

Sample One Dropped via: f369ee5fc8dcf5a9e95d85dadff5a095a0e3a760 (hta.dll)

Sample Two Dropped via: f369ee5fc8dcf5a9e95d85dadff5a095a0e3a760 (hta.dll)
C2: www.kcps[.]edu[.]in AllaKore RAT:
972d85b5736ae8bdf06a9d74f2a3356829ce2095 (sicsmdb.exe) C2:
185.229.119.60:9134

Examining threat telemetry data for the two C2 IPs 89.117.63.146 and 185.229.119.60 we
observed initial victim connections on 06 January 2023 and 22 February 2023 respectively.

In total we observed 236 distinct victims, all located in India, connecting to the C2 servers.
When compared to the victim numbers for the Action RAT C2s, it could be assessed that
AllaKore RAT is deployed more widely and via other means outside of the scope of the
infection chain described by QiAnXin.

Further to this activity we also observed 455 distinct IPs (again all located in India)
connecting to 89.117.63.146:7439 and 185.229.119.60:7469 in activity which commenced at
the same time as the activity on the ports associated with the AllaKore RAT samples.

We were unable to identify samples talking to TCP/7439 of 89.117.63.146 and TCP/7469 of
185.229.119.60, however as previously we would hypothesize that this IP was used for C2
communications with another tool associated with SideCopy activities.

Conclusion

In this blog post we have sought to illustrate the following points:

We have good evidence to demonstrate this particular SideCopy campaign, highlighted
first by others in the industry, was successful in targeting Indian users. This finding is
based on observations within our threat telemetry data, indicating victim connections to
the C2 servers.
Victim activity predated the public reporting of this campaign, in some cases by several
months. This continues to support the statistics about attacker dwell time, and
highlights the importance of retrospective analysis of data logs.
There is specific evidence to demonstrate that the Action RAT infrastructure, connected
to SideCopy, is managed by users accessing the Internet from Pakistan.
Pivots on known threat actor infrastructure can lead to the identification of further,
previously unknown infrastructure, in addition to hints at attribution and management.

Recommendations

We would recommend that cyber defenders, particularly those located in countries /
regions which SideCopy operations are known to target, use the IOCs mentioned in
this blog to hunt against their own data holdings (including historical logs), and to
preemptively block malicious activity.
Users of Pure Signal Recon can examine this campaign by querying against the
domains and IP addresses referenced in the IOC section below. Further pivots into
other currently unknown infrastructure may be possible as this threat actor undertakes
future campaigns.
