THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

ABSTRACT
Berserk Bear, alternatively referred to as Dragonfly, Crouching Yeti, and several other names, has compromised multiple
networks across several continents since at least 2010. In that time, Berserk Bear infiltrated numerous industrial and critical
infrastructure entities – but with no known, deliberate disruptive effect. In this sense, Berserk stands apart from other
entities targeting critical infrastructure linked to Russian intelligence organizations, such as Sandworm, which induced
multiple disruptions in various entities over the same period.
Berserk thus appears a curious entity: capable of leveraging various sophisticated techniques, such as vendor and supply
chain intrusions, to breach some of the most sensitive civilian institutions in Europe and North America, while seemingly
doing nothing with such access. Yet for all its lack of direct impact such activity is not benign, and likely does not represent
mere information gathering. Rather, Berserk’s actions represent long-term capability and access development designed to
prepare for action in the most frightening of environments: outright conflict between Berserk’s sponsors or directors (likely
Russian strategic leadership) and various Western interests.
In this paper we will explore Berserk Bear’s decade of operations, including an overview of technical capabilities and
efforts, to understand this enigmatic threat actor. While doing so, we will uncover items previously linked to this group’s
activity and also disclose likely physical disruption operations caused by this group accidentally, resulting in
significant damage to victim environments. As a result of this discussion, we will not only learn more about a
particularly interesting threat actor, we will also discover vital aspects concerning supply chain intrusions, cyber
contributions to preparation for kinetic warfare, and what happens when intrusions in cyber-physical environments
produce unintended results.

INTRODUCTION
‘Berserk Bear’ refers to a cyber threat actor operating, in various ways, since at least 2010. Alternatively referred to as
Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, TEMP.Isotope, Crouching Yeti, ALLANITE or DYMALLOY, among other names [1, 2], the
group launched a series of campaigns against various critical infrastructure entities, largely in Europe and North America,
but is not associated with any known deliberate destructive event [3]. For the sake of simplicity, this entity will be referred
to as ‘Berserk Bear’ or just ‘Berserk’ for the remainder of this paper. Linked to Russian intelligence operations by several
governments and commercial researchers, Berserk Bear differentiates itself from other critical infrastructure targeting
groups with similar affiliation, such as Sandworm [4], due to this lack of identified impacts.

Figure 1: Berserk overview.
Yet a closer examination of Berserk Bear’s actions taking place over a decade reveals a much more nuanced and
concerning picture. Although not associated with deliberate disruption, the group has targeted and successfully
penetrated networks ranging from critical industrial environments to election-related operations. This continued
willingness to target and breach sensitive, critical networks places Berserk in an interesting position: not pursuing
immediate payoffs, but rather establishing the information collection and access development operations that could
facilitate future actions at a time of its sponsor’s choosing. Given this history, a thorough review of activity linked to or
associated with Berserk Bear is incredibly valuable both to understand the intentions of a worrisome adversary and to
ensure awareness for defenders and policymakers.

THE DRAGONFLY CAMPAIGN
Berserk Bear first entered public consciousness through public reporting from Symantec, Kaspersky and CrowdStrike (who
then referred to the entity as Energetic Bear) [5, 6, 7]. Piecing together observations from each vendor, we witness a
widespread campaign starting no later than 2010 (but possibly earlier) through at least 2014, targeting manufacturing, oil
and gas, and electric utility entities across North America and Europe. On a technical level, this activity is notable for
blending operational techniques. At various times, Berserk Bear utilized mechanisms ranging from traditional phishing to
strategic website compromise (SWC), to supply chain intrusions for initial access. In most cases, such operations led to the
deployment of actor-specific malware, notably (but not exclusively) the modular Havex family.

Phishing activity
Throughout its initial period of activity, Berserk leveraged phishing with malicious attachments as a primary component of
initial access operations [6]. In all documented cases, which were active in 2013 – 2014 but also potentially as early as
2010, malicious emails were sent to various executives and senior employees at target companies. While multiple vendor
reports indicate phishing messages originated from the same Gmail account, it is unclear if this is definitive or instead an
artifact of limited visibility.
Irrespective of vector, the phishing activity consistently leveraged the same vulnerability for initial code execution:
CVE-2011-0611, relating to embedded Flash objects in file formats such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) items
[5, 8, 9]. In addition to native PDFs, some vendor reporting also indicates distribution via XML Data Package (XDP) files,
with a malicious PDF stored within the container [6]. In either case, typical infection activity combined the exploit (for
code execution purposes), malware (typically Havex, discussed in greater detail below), and a Java archive (JAR) file used
to load and execute the malware payload.
Analysing publicly and commercially available samples, attachments to malicious emails typically displayed gibberish or
no substantive content, rather than a fully developed lure or decoy. This aspect of lure documents would change
significantly with Berserk evolution, even if other characteristics of malicious document use would remain similar.

Strategic website compromise
Berserk employed SWC (also referred to as ‘watering hole attacks’) concurrently with phishing activity. While reporting
from Symantec indicates SWC activity took place largely in mid- to late-2013, Kaspersky analysis indicates such activity
may have started significantly earlier and continued through 2014. Berserk compromised a variety of websites, ranging
from the energy to financial sectors, to insert a redirect to another compromised, legitimate website hosting an exploit kit
[5, 10]. Overall, initial modified websites trended toward industrial, oil and gas, and electrical entities based on reporting
from multiple entities. An overview of compromised sites noted in public reporting can be found in Table 1.
Initially, Berserk operations used the LightsOut exploit kit to compromise either Java or Internet Explorer to gain initial
code execution on victim machines [10, 11]. The group then modified operations to a newer variant of LightsOut, dubbed
‘Hello’ or ‘HelloEK’ [5, 12, 13]. In all publicly identified cases, the exploit kits were used to download a payload: either a
variant of Havex or a malware referred to as Karagany.

Supply chain intrusions
Finally, early Berserk-related activity utilized a third intrusion mechanism: modifying installation packages for specific
control system software to deliver Havex variants. In many respects the most interesting as well as the most concerning
intrusion vector, this methodology relied on first breaching a given vendor or supplier of equipment (and software) for
industrial environments, producing a modified installation package including malicious functionality, then replacing
legitimate packages on vendor websites for ultimate victims to download.
This phase of operations is the most explicit in industrial control system (ICS)-specific targeting. As documented by Erik
Hjelmvik, Joel Langill, Dale Peterson, and others, Berserk activity included at least six software suites across three vendors
[14, 15, 16]:
• MESA Imaging Swiss Ranger photography software [17].
• eWon Talk2M eCatcher industrial maintenance software [18].
• eWon eGrabit VPN client software [19].
• Various MB ConnectLine tools, including mbCONFTOOL, mbCHECK and VCOM_LAN2, all associated with
configuration software for industrial networking appliances [20].
In each of the above cases, the victim organization represented a niche supplier often integrated into larger projects, or at
minimum far smaller than major ICS-related original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Of note, although the intrusion at
MESA is unclear (and the company has since gone out of business), both eWon and MB Connect statements indicate initial
intrusions into their respective environments via content management system (CMS) vulnerabilities on their respective
websites [21, 22]. In both cases, limited information indicates CMS vulnerabilities were leveraged by Berserk to upload
malicious variants of the companies’ software packages.
All three of the impacted companies are (or were, in the case of MESA) based in European countries. Furthermore, analysis
of product applications and use indicate the respective software items were largely focused on or only present in European

4

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

markets. Even more interesting, in the case of MB ConnectLine’s mbCHECK, which had both North American and
European software versions, only the European version was modified even though the CMS vulnerability used would have
allowed for both products to be replaced with malicious variants. Although other manufacturers may have been impacted in
this event, the above observations strongly suggest a primary targeting focus on Western European industrial entities for
this portion of Berserk operations.
Technical examination of the modified binaries shows a common artifact in the Portable Executable (PE) header of each: an
‘.ndata’ section with a raw size of zero but a large virtual size, indicative of packed or compressed software. In this case, the
observations align with a specific packaging mechanism: the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS). Although designed
for legitimate use, various malicious entities utilize NSIS packaging to obfuscate malware or evade detection.
Nearly all the original, unmodified binaries do not use NSIS for packaging software. Looking at PE header information
between the malicious items associated with Berserk activity and pre- and post-attack software, the legitimate software
items feature dramatically different structures from the NSIS-packaged Berserk items.

Figure 3: Comparison of PE headers for mbCHECK installer.
Although definitive evidence does not exist, what information is available strongly suggests that Berserk modified the
original binaries to package them, along with other components, with NSIS. This technique is not unique to Berserk and is
reflected in activity ranging from ransomware to targeted intrusions.
Of note, the MESA Imaging SwissRanger software legitimately used NSIS packaging in benign versions of the software before
and after the Berserk-related events. In this case, it is unclear precisely how Berserk modified the binary, unless access to
source packages and related items allowed the entity to repackage the NSIS installer to include malicious functionality.
In all observed cases, the modified ICS-related binaries typically contain similar functionality: deploying an encoded
Havex DLL payload to victim machines. Specific deployment characteristics and filesystem location change depending on
the variant. But in all publicly known cases, modified installers drop the Havex DLL to disk then launch it via ‘rundll32’
calling a ‘RunDllEntry’ export, passing execution on to the malware.

Havex malware
All available information and third-party reporting indicate that the ultimate purpose of original Berserk activity (the
‘Dragonfly campaign’) was delivery and installation of Havex malware. While delivered in various ways, including in some

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2021

5

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

cases through intermediate malware (described briefly below), Havex represents the identified, known end-goal of these
early 2010s intrusions.
Havex serves as scaffolding around which other capabilities can be built, working in a modular fashion to incorporate
additional functionality given Berserk’s intentions or purpose. As such, Havex on its own is a mere loader for other
capabilities. Berserk delivered Havex as a DLL, typically embedded in other objects, which injects further code into the
Explorer process. Once running in the context of a trusted program, Havex reaches out via its command-and-control (C2)
communications to check in with its operators, and download additional functionality or modules [6, 23]. Havex persistence
is relatively simple, writing itself to disk (usually %AppData%, %TEMP% or %System32%) and creating an auto-start
registry key.
Havex only begins to become interesting when examining the follow-on modules that provide functionality. Based on
reporting from multiple security vendors, Berserk used compromised, legitimate websites to host C2 and Havex modules, a
trend which would continue through subsequent Berserk activity post-Dragonfly. Module functionality includes several
typical intrusion capabilities: system profiling, network enumeration, password theft, and similar post-exploitation
activities.
However, Havex also included specialized modules with a then-unique purpose: enumerating and mapping ICS-specific
systems in victim environments. Although relatively primitive, examination of the various modules shows a definite
emphasis on ICS-related processes and protocols [24, 25]. For example, a network scanner module used in Havex
operations features relatively straightforward scanning functionality, but does so with a particular interest in hard-coded
ICS-related ports, as described in Table 2.

Table 2: Hard-coded ICS-related ports.

For emphasis: the above are the only ports scanned on the /24 subnet of the executing machine. Other, typical ports
enumerated such as remote access services are simply not present. Such behaviour indicates specific intentions to identify a
relatively narrow range of industrial products.
In addition to the above module, Havex also incorporates a protocol-specific enumeration utility focusing on the Open
Platform Communication (OPC) standard [6, 24, 26, 27]. The module enumerates OPC servers to identify clients and
related information, but no known functionality exists to deliberately interact with or modify OPC functionality. As written,
all publicly identified examples of this module appear to be reconnaissance-focused, with no capability to intentionally
cause disruption or manipulation of industrial systems.
Although not designed to cause disruption, testing of Havex’s OPC module reveals some concerning features. When tested
in certain environments, the OPC module induces OPC server crashes, which have the possibility of inducing follow-on
process instability [28, 29]. Uncontrolled process termination in industrial environments can lead to a number of
consequences, from short-term loss of visibility to potential process destruction. That the OPC enumeration feature
contained this ability is indicative of either a lack of thorough testing by Berserk-supporting developers, or a callousness
with respect to potential consequences from running such a tool. The implications of this will be examined shortly.

Other observed malware tools
In addition to Havex, the Dragonfly campaign is associated with several other tools. Although in several cases not exclusive
to the actor, the other items were also present in early Berserk activity:
• Karagany, a remote access and information-stealing tool used as an intermediate item prior to the deployment of Havex
[5, 30]. The malware is based on leaked code from the earlier crimeware-focused DreamLoader framework [31], and
as such cannot be considered exclusive to Berserk operations.
• Sysmain, a remote access tool packaged as a DLL for information gathering and follow-on command execution [6].
While otherwise unremarkable, analysis from Kaspersky indicated that in at least some instances, compromised MESA
Imaging software delivered Sysmain as its payload rather than Havex, making it an exception to the majority of
observed supply chain compromises. This feature is also significant as MESA Imaging products were originally
packaged via NSIS, unlike other vectors which were modified to do so.

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

• DDex, a lightweight downloader with persistence capability [6]. The malware takes its name from observed instances
in the wild, named ‘ddex.exe’. Of note, in the few samples available for analysis, file names and paths are hard coded,
indicating a somewhat brittle tool used as an intermediary to load additional functionality.
• ClientX, which, based on analysis from Kaspersky, is functionally identical to Sysmain, but written in .NET [6].
Other than Karagany, the remaining tools associated with early Berserk operations are only documented in reporting from
Kaspersky relating to what it refers to as ‘Crouching Yeti’. Yet other than Karagany’s origins in leaked code, the remaining
tools all appear to be uniquely associated with early Berserk operations with no evidence of widespread use. The latter
point is further emphasized in that, while the Dragonfly campaign featured analysis from multiple organizations, only one
entity (Kaspersky) identified (or at least publicly documented) payloads beyond Havex and Karagany in reporting.

Campaign targeting
The Dragonfly campaign started no later than 2010 and appears to have concluded in 2014 following public disclosure. During
this period, the threat actor impacted several entities. Yet the precise geography and industry vertical of victims shifts
depending on what public reporting one consults. For example, reporting from Symantec and CrowdStrike emphasize energy
sector entities across Europe and North America as primary victims in the Dragonfly campaign [5, 7]. However, reporting from
Kaspersky shows quite widespread activity, including multiple victims in South America, Central and Southeast Asia, and the
Russian Federation, with significant representation from educational and government entities among known victims [6].
Based on the above, the Dragonfly campaign appears confusing. Depending on the source, the campaign either appears
focused on ICS-related entities and critical infrastructure, or functions as a much wider targeting entity among both critical
infrastructure and traditional espionage targets. From a broader cyber threat intelligence (CTI) perspective, this situation
highlights how different types of visibility into events can produce different conclusions.
In the case of early Berserk behaviours, the Dragonfly campaign appears to be widespread in overall nature. However, by
2013, the combination of SWC targets, specific Havex modules, and documented victimology strongly suggests the main
thrust of the later stages of the Dragonfly campaign was gaining initial access to and performing reconnaissance of
industrial and critical infrastructure entities. Such activity took place across the oil and gas and manufacturing verticals in
Europe and North America, with potential for activity in other regions as well. While concerning, such intrusions appear to
have stopped at information gathering without any disruptive impact or clear intention to deliver such an effect, or so it
would seem.

POSSIBLE DESTRUCTIVE INCIDENT
While there is nothing publicly known about the Dragonfly campaign and early Berserk activity, or in the capabilities of
any software associated with these activities, that indicates such actions were intended to disrupt critical infrastructure
environments, this observation does not remove the possibility of unintentional or accidental disruption while operating in
such networks. Given the environments in which Berserk operated during parts of the Dragonfly campaign, even though the
group likely did not have disruptive intent, the possibility exists for unintended consequences in sensitive environments.
Reviewing Havex functionality, interesting possibilities emerge. When looking specifically at the OPC enumeration utility,
testing in multiple environments demonstrated that this utility could cause a scanned OPC server to crash. Depending on
error handling and other controls, such an abrupt event could result in follow-on process instability. Therefore, while the
Dragonfly campaign appears to focus on espionage or, at worst, initial access to sensitive environments for later operational
flexibility, the mere execution of one of the responsible entity’s survey programs could result in inadvertent disruption.
In an annual review of events taking place in 2014, the German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)
disclosed a disruptive incident at an unnamed steel mill resulting in physical destruction [32, 33]. Unfortunately, many
specific details around this event, including precisely when it occurred, were not provided in BSI’s reporting. Yet given
when the report was released, as part of a review of events in 2014, we can assess with moderate confidence that the event
took place in 2014, and with high confidence (given the volatile nature of digital evidence to assess this as a cyber incident)
that the event took place not long before then. This tentative timeline would place the steel mill incident in the same period
of time as the Dragonfly campaign.
Reviewing limited details of the steel mill event, BSI reporting indicates that unnamed intruders leveraged spear phishing to
gain credentials from users in the victim environment to enable initial access. The intruder then pivoted throughout the
environment until actions resulted in multiple components of the victim entity’s blast furnace to fail, inducing physical
damage.
Although none of the reporting or analysing entities at the time of the incident made conclusive attribution statements, with
the benefit of hindsight we can draw some potential conclusions. While the tradecraft (loosely) documented in BSI
reporting (phishing and credential capture for lateral movement) is rather common, such activity also aligns with Berserk
operations in the Dragonfly campaign, and closely aligns with follow-on Berserk actions documented below. Additionally,
the Dragonfly campaign featured extensive intrusions into European manufacturing organizations from at least 2010
through 2014, which links to the steel mill incident in terms of industry vertical and geography. Finally, the unstable nature

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2021

7

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

of the OPC enumeration payload of Havex could induce process instability through ICS disruption, which could yield a
potentially destructive result, depending on the environment.
While insufficient evidence exists in publicly available resources to confirm any of the above observations, the combination
of timing, victimology, and (inadvertent) capability points to Berserk Bear as a likely suspect for inducing the steel mill
incident. Even though the event was almost certainly unintended, the effects produced show the risks inherent in operating
in critical infrastructure or similar environments.

RESURGENCE: DRAGONFLY 2.0 TO PALMETTO FUSION
Following multiple public disclosures in 2014, Berserk-related activity appeared to cease after the Dragonfly campaign. Yet
in 2017, researchers at Symantec disclosed a new campaign of phishing (combined with SWC) designed to capture
credentials from victims [34]. This reporting was reflected in subsequent US government notifications [35], which were
later revised to indicate a link to Russian state-sponsored activity [36]. Although the Symantec and US government
reporting overlap, analysis of specific behaviours, targeting and tooling indicates a bifurcation in campaigns. Symantec’s
Dragonfly 2.0 activity appears aligned with targeting of Turkey and European entities from late 2015 through 2017, while
US reporting, referenced as ‘Palmetto Fusion’ in initial disclosures, targeted US and UK electric sector entities from 2017
through at least 2019 [37, 38].
Given disclosures in 2014, Berserk appears to have taken only a short break in operations between the original Dragonfly
campaign and this activity. Within that time though, the group substantially modified operations while preserving enough
technical and other links to associate this activity with previous campaigns. While behavioural characteristics of the
activities shifted, which would justify tracking this activity (including components of these campaigns) as separate
behavioural clusters, sufficient evidence exists combined with government disclosures to justify linking all these activities
back to the same likely ‘sponsor’ or entity under Berserk Bear.

Continued phishing and strategic website compromise
As with the Dragonfly campaign, Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion leveraged phishing and SWC for initial access
purposes. However, while targeting characteristics (focus on energy-themed entities and concepts) were similar to earlier
activities, actual functionality was substantially different. Rather than utilize malicious documents or SWC to directly
deploy capabilities (e.g. exploits or malware) on victim systems, all observed items in this campaign instead used
functionality in Windows operating systems to generate an outbound Server Message Block (SMB) communication to
adversary-controlled infrastructure. If successful and collected, Berserk would then harvest NTLM credentials from this
connection to replay for remote access into victim environments, potentially via tools such as Responder [39].

Fun with Phishery
Public indications of energy sector-focused phishing activity first appeared in July 2017 from researchers at Cisco Talos
[40], although parallel non-public reporting existed in US government circles followed by media disclosure of some
high-profile victims [41]. Malicious documents leveraged implementations of an open-source tool called Phishery for
injecting a remote resource, prompting an outbound SMB connection, into the file [42].
While technically rather simple, targeting and document construction appears to be quite specific to victim organizations
and industry verticals. For example, initial phishing activity linked to Dragonfly 2.0 targeted a Turkish oil and gas entity
using a holiday party theme, and an unnamed entity spoofing ISO 27001 awareness.

Figure 4: Phishing samples, Dragonfly 2.0.

Later examples, more closely aligned with the Palmetto Fusion activity documented by the US government, generally used
well-crafted resumes for power engineers as lures with an ultimate focus on US and UK targets in the electric sector.

Figure 5: Palmetto Fusion resume phish.
Although straightforward, the phishing campaigns in question, especially the later Palmetto Fusion stages, are interesting
given strategic targeting of service providers as intermediate victims. As documented by Rebecca Smith and Robert Barry,
the entities responsible for this campaign appeared to compromise various contractors and other entities first, and used
these entities to then distribute the malicious emails and credential leaking documents to electric utility victims [43]. In this
fashion, trust-subversion tactics previously observed in the Dragonfly campaign resurfaced, but this time targeting service
relationships rather than software dependencies. Through a sequence of intermediate compromises, Berserk could move
from service providers to ultimate victims, leveraging existing trust relationships to improve the likelihood of successful
interaction with malicious attachments.

Figure 6: Palmetto Fusion campaign targeting sequence.

Leaking credentials from websites
SWC activity related to Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion activity followed the same behavioural pattern as the malicious
documents: leaking credentials from victims, and not delivering exploits or malicious payloads directly. While avoiding
such active content in modified web pages, these campaigns continued an emphasis on energy and related entities, as seen
in the list of compromised sites involved in the incident (Table 3).

Implementation of SWC varied depending on timing and targeting. Dragonfly 2.0 targeting of European and Turkish
energy entities used a nested mechanism for redirecting queries, potentially acting as a filtering mechanism and similar to
earlier Dragonfly activity, before arriving at the ultimate resource inducing the SMB connection [44]. A modified PHP
object first directs to one Virtual Private Server (VPS) via HTTP, which then attempts to retrieve a file object via SMB from
a different VPS instance.
Later activity, corresponding with the largely US- and UK-focused Palmetto Fusion activity, appears to focus on
compromise of the TYPO3 Content Management System (CMS) to modify a JavaScript object (typically jquery.easing.js).
CMS targeting, while not uncommon, links to the subversion of ICS software providers in the Dragonfly campaign. During
Palmetto Fusion operations, multiple websites for power, energy, and engineering publications featured a modification to
the same resource with the following path:
/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js
When loaded, the modified library attempts to retrieve a 1x1 pixel image referencing an external object to prompt the
external authentication attempt. Unlike the Turkish campaigns taking place earlier, this activity directly references
adversary-controlled infrastructure as opposed to using redirects to obfuscate activity or introduce possible filtering.

Figure 7: Injected code example.
In addition to distinctions in direct reference of external resources, the two campaigns also feature differences in
infrastructure characteristics. While the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign appears to largely rely on adversary-owned and -controlled
VPS infrastructure, the Palmetto Fusion campaign almost exclusively leverages legitimate, compromised network
infrastructure. As documented by Kaspersky, parallel Berserk-related operations focused on gathering infrastructure
through server compromise, both to deploy SWC and to provide infrastructure to receive leaked credentials [45].

Change in tools and deployed capabilities
Although the Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion campaigns represent near continuous operations from late 2015 through at
least 2019, substantial differences in post-intrusion behaviour align with the geographic and temporal separation in
campaigns. Differences are significant enough that, using behaviour-focused attribution methodologies, the campaigns
could be taken as the actions of separate, distinct activity groups. Yet identified overlaps in infrastructure, targeting and
some techniques indicate that, at minimum, these operations were executed by entities pursuing similar objectives, if not
separate teams within the same organization.

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2021

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

Earlier activities corresponding to Turkish and other targeting in the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign closely resemble the original
Dragonfly activity in many characteristics. While initial access mechanisms are noticeably different, post-intrusion
tradecraft mirrors original Dragonfly operations through the use of a combination of various types of malware, including
some types narrowly associated with Berserk operations such as Karagany variants and a unique backdoor referred to by
Symantec as Heriplor, closely linked to Havex-related payloads from the Dragonfly campaign [34].
Later activity, aligned with the Palmetto Fusion phase of operations, shifted behaviours noticeably. While Berserk
employed similar intrusion techniques to the Dragonfly 2.0 activity (credential-leaking phishing and SWC), post-intrusion
behaviours were substantially different. Particularly, these operations featured the near-complete absence of any custom
tooling or malware. Instead, lateral movement and post-exploitation activity focused on a combination of continuous
credential capture and reuse and the deployment of either legitimate tools used maliciously or publicly available
frameworks for intrusion operations, such as the PSExec utility or leveraging system commands to create and enable
adversary-controlled accounts.

ICS-specific activity
In the Palmetto Fusion phase of operations, reporting from multiple commercial, media and government entities confirms
that Berserk sought and, in several cases, succeeded in gaining access to industrial environments, including control
systems. Yet unlike the Dragonfly campaign, no ICS-specific tooling or capability, such as Havex’s OPC item or related
port scanners, were identified. At first glance, this appears to represent a devolution of capability, moving from ICS-aware
software to only using native commands and similar for reconnaissance purposes.
Yet given the previous discussion of the German steel mill incident and its potential connection to the Dragonfly campaign,
this operational change may represent an adjustment following that event. If Berserk was responsible for this incident, after
(inadvertently) causing a disruptive incident through the somewhat buggy OPC polling entity, Berserk appears to have
modified its tradecraft to avoid capabilities that would result in similar unintended consequences. Particularly given that
this campaign largely focused on critical infrastructure entities in the US, an accidental disruption in these environments
would presumably be quite costly or risky, arguing for greater caution.
Berserk’s restraint is shown in what actions the entity took in control system environments: searching for and copying items
such as remote access profiles and control system-related documentation. When accessing more sensitive equipment, such
as human-machine interfaces (HMIs) within a victim environment, Berserk deployed a custom tool to take a screenshot of
the system which was exfiltrated via existing remote access mechanisms, shown in Figure 8.

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

Thus, while Berserk’s ability to access these environments is quite concerning, all available evidence indicates this entity
sought to avoid any potential disruptive or unintentionally destructive impact. Whether this is a result of learning from the
steel mill incident, or an abundance of caution given the targets, we can look at these ICS-related intrusions as representing
access development and information gathering (potentially to enable future operations) as opposed to an immediate ‘attack’
or similar [46].

Distinguishing Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion from Dragonfly
Reviewing activity from Dragonfly to Dragonfly 2.0 to Palmetto Fusion, we can observe a steady evolution in operations
and behaviours through each campaign. Illustrated Figure 9, we observe overlaps from one campaign to the next, but
sufficient development such that Dragonfly and Palmetto Fusion ultimately look like separate operations aside from
overlaps in targeting. Without the Dragonfly 2.0 activity serving as a vital link between the two, with its continued use of
Dragonfly-related tools but introduction of credential harvesting as a primary mechanism which the Palmetto Fusion phase
would rely on almost exclusively, drawing a line of continuity through these activities would be problematic. Yet because of
this iterative nature between campaigns, with only some aspects altered while others remain the same, we can link these
groups together as likely phases for the same entity, Berserk Bear.

Figure 9: Comparing Dragonfly, Palmetto Fusion and Dragonfly 2.0.

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE INTRUSIONS
Concurrent with Palmetto Fusion activity in 2018, US and UK government reporting identified another campaign targeting
critical infrastructure environments [47, 48]. Subsequent discussions with victims and other sources indicate that the
electric sector was a primary, although not exclusive, target of this campaign. While US and UK sources did not attribute
this campaign to any specific threat actor (other than identifying it as Russian in origin), several items tangentially link this
activity to Berserk:
• Targeting of critical infrastructure sectors directly and indirectly through service provider relationships (in this case,
Internet service providers).
• Timing that overlaps with the Palmetto Fusion phishing and SWC campaign.
• Use of credential harvesting and replay to enable access and subsequent operations in victim environments.
• Leveraging built-in system functionality and tools to modify configurations and other items for malicious purposes.
While the above indicate a potential link, operations against network infrastructure devices such as routers would represent
a significant departure from known Berserk behaviours going back to the Dragonfly campaign. The identified activity may
represent a link to the same ultimate decision-making authority within Russian intelligence operations, but behaviourally
appears too distinct to firmly link to Berserk based on publicly available information.

Recent activity
Beginning in 2019, SWC activity resembling previous Berserk operations in the Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion
campaigns reappeared. While remaining largely focused on critical infrastructure entities, targeting scope expanded to
include entities such as airports, government and election authorities, and general media items.

Ukrainian political and energy entities
In early to mid-February 2019, various websites in Ukraine featured compromises similar to past Berserk operations. In
addition to targeting the Ukrainian energy sector, such as injecting into various subdomains for Ukrainian energy
conglomerate Dtek, the campaign expanded in May 2019 to include various media and cultural entities.

Table 4: Ukrainian websites featuring compromises.
In many cases, these compromises persisted through at least late 2020 [49]. Examination of specific SWC instances shows
a combination of injecting into static web pages, a tactic not observed in earlier activity, and modifying various JavaScript
items in a manner nearly identical to the Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion campaigns.
From a targeting perspective this activity shows flexibility in what appear to be Berserk-related operations. In terms of
timing, initial compromises coincided with Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election. From this, we can hypothesize that
Berserk-related operations were ‘retasked’ to cover this strategically significant event (from a Russian perspective). While
this seems plausible, the very broad nature of some of the targets, including major general media sites and a popular
football club, indicates a very wide, unfocused net for activity. This lack of specificity is further emphasized by the lack of
intermediate, ‘screening’ links as seen in historical Berserk-related activity.

Airports and Western infrastructure
In April 2019, multiple entities identified a modification to San Francisco International Airport’s website (the primary web
page, and a mirrored resource) [50]. Further analysis revealed a SWC incident essentially identical to historical Berserk
activity. Additional research identified over a dozen other airports in the United States exhibiting similar signs of
compromise in 2020, indicating a potential expansion of Berserk-related activity to transportation-related entities. Of note,
available evidence does not appear to indicate targeting of the airports as the primary objective, but rather inducing the
same credential leak behaviours to target visitors to the airport websites.
Subsequent reporting in October 2020 identified further intrusions into transportation and local government networks in the
US [51, 52]. Most worrying about these intrusions, events appeared to extend into election and related infrastructure in line
with the 2020 US Presidential election. In this sense, activity mirrors the earlier Ukraine-focused activity, in being linked to
a major political event. As with other Berserk activity, the event is not linked to any known, attempted disruptive activity,
and likely represents either intelligence gathering or, at most, opportunistic prepositioning for future operations.
Nonetheless, this extension to election-related infrastructure in state and local government networks represents a worrying
expansion in targeting.

RELATIONSHIP TO RUSSIAN-LINKED CYBER OPERATIONS
Although the original Dragonfly campaign largely evaded any specific attribution, the US and UK governments
subsequently linked Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion campaign activity to Russian intelligence operations [36, 53].
While such statements establish a degree of high-level responsibility for events, such ‘general attribution’ claims are not
especially helpful for network defenders and critical infrastructure operators [54].
Russian-nexus cyber operations targeting external entities largely break down into actions guided or executed by teams
under three entities: the Military General Staff’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB),
and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) [55]. In addition to academic interest in aligning cyber operations with their
likely sponsor organization, the missions and behaviours of these different organizations can give us insight into potential
intentions and purpose. For example, GRU-aligned entities possess a history of engaging in direct, deliberate disruptive
operations, such as the Ukraine power events and similar incidents tied to the GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies,
Unit 74455, commonly referred to as Sandworm [4, 56]. Meanwhile operations associated with the SVR, although at times

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2021

13

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

involving critical infrastructure sectors, are exclusively linked with intelligence gathering and similar activity, even in
recent widespread campaigns such as NOBELIUM-related activity. [57] [58]
Given Berserk’s continued operations against critical infrastructure targets for over a decade, understanding how this group
aligns with more general Russian-nexus cyber operations can be quite valuable in determining potential motivations. For
example, alignment with GRU entities would indicate the potential for rapid movement from intrusion to deliberate
disruptive or destructive actions, while alignment with either of the civilian intelligence agencies (FSB or SVR) would
strongly suggest either an intelligence or long-term ‘prepositioning’ focus rather than attempting immediate impacts.
In 2018, the UK’s NCSC published a lengthy list of disruptive or controversial operations linked with various elements of
the GRU [56]. The list includes high-profile incidents such as the Ukraine electric sector attacks along with other
operations, but notably omits elements of the Palmetto Fusion campaign (which also targeted the UK electric sector) and
the network infrastructure compromises discussed previously that may also link to Berserk operations [48]. Although
unfortunately not definitive, the lack of any public link between Berserk operations with GRU-related incidents allows us to
provisionally conclude that Berserk is not part of Russia’s military intelligence apparatus, with its history of launching
disruptive events.
If we begin to look at Russia’s civilian intelligence organizations, the SVR and FSB, other possibilities begin to emerge
[59]. Although no threat actor associated with the SVR or FSB is associated with a high-profile critical infrastructure event
such as the Ukraine attacks, and responsibility for the 2017 Triton event remains unknown beyond general Russian
responsibility [60, 61], various campaigns linked to these entities have previously touched industrial and critical networks.
Examples include the NOBELIUM campaign, along with historical activity linked to SVR-associated APT29 [62, 63].
The above observations are supported by limited information, primarily leaked from government sources, indicating that
Berserk likely resides under FSB authorities [37, 41]. Reviewing available evidence, this appears to make sense for several
reasons:
• Lack of known, intentional disruptive operations against critical infrastructure (assuming Berserk is responsible for the
steel mill incident, and that this was an accident).
• Absence of any group consistently targeting critical and industrial infrastructure linked to FSB authorities among
Russian intelligence agencies.

Figure 10: Overview of Russia-linked cyber actors.

THE BAFFLING BERSERK BEAR: A DECADE’S ACTIVITY... SLOWIK

• Possessing independent, unrelated ICS-related capabilities from all other entities linked to Russian intelligence
operations.
Unfortunately, most of the above items are simply stating what Berserk is not (specifically, not the GRU, and probably not
the SVR) rather than saying what Berserk actually is. As such, while multiple sources imply a link between Berserk Bear
and Russia’s FSB, publicly available evidence does not exist at this point to solidify this link. Yet even though we have
failed in deriving specific attribution for Berserk, we can still make reasonable claims with respect to Berserk’s operations
and likely intentions: to gather intelligence on and access to targets of interest, but likely not to move toward immediately
using such access for disruptive purposes except in extreme circumstances (such as armed conflict).

CONCLUSIONS
Berserk Bear, an entity known by many names over many years, carved a fascinating history through operations targeting
multiple facets of European and North American critical infrastructure entities. Aside from the group’s longevity (taking
behavioural evolutions into account), the group also demonstrated the capability to interact with ICS-related environments
through multiple mechanisms. Yet despite the group’s history and technical prowess, it frequently receives second billing
(at best) relative to other Russian-linked entities such as Turla, Sandworm and NOBELIUM.
Berserk may be overlooked because in many respects (aside from the potential steel mill incident) it represents the ‘dog
that didn’t bark’. For all the group’s activity, it is not linked to any single, definitive incident or disruptive event that would
garner headlines and attention. While operations from the Palmetto Fusion campaign through the present indicate
expanding appetites for the group, there is no Triton incident or large-scale power disruption associated with the entity.
But adopting this view is myopic to say the least, and quite likely dangerous given Berserk’s demonstrated capabilities.
Principally, Berserk Bear has repeatedly demonstrated the willingness and ability to penetrate industrial and critical
infrastructure environments for over ten years. In doing so, the group has almost certainly facilitated significant intelligence
gathering, capability development, and potentially effects pre-positioning in highly sensitive networks. While available
information indicates Berserk has not deliberately engaged in disruptive acts thus far, the group has laid the groundwork for
potentially crippling attacks through its persistence and ability to generally avoid significant attention. While a Berserk
Bear intrusion may not be associated with an immediate attack like some other Russian-linked intrusion sets, asset owners
and network defenders would do well to treat any sign of this group as deeply worrisome. While Berserk’s impacts may be
delayed, the group remains one of the most stubborn and capable entities willing to dive straight to the heart of vital
networks across multiple industry verticals and geographies.
