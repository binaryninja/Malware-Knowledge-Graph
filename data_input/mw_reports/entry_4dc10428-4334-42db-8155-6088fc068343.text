This blog has previously shown that by starting with an APT it is possible to identify the
individuals and companies responsible for conducting their attacks and the State actors
behind them. We have also shown that you can start with the State and work backwards to
the APT.
APT groups in China have a common blueprint: contract hackers and specialists, front
companies, and an intelligence officer. We know that multiple areas of China each have their
own APT.
After a long investigation we now know that it is possible to take a province and identify front
companies, from those companies identify individuals who work there, and then connect
these companies and individuals to an APT and the State.

Our previous research showed that science and technology companies Boyusec, Huaying
Haitai, Antorsoft, and others were fronts for Chinese MSS-sponsored APT activity. If you take
the blueprint above and search for it elsewhere, an interesting and increasingly bizarre series
of links begin to emerge.
Northern China has received much, presumably unwelcome, attention from this blog already.
For our next example, let’s look South, as far South as we can while remaining in China.
Hainan – a semi-tropical island paradise conveniently located for Chinese tourists, known for
its production of rubber and iron ore, its rocket launches, and its views over the South China
Sea. What it is not internationally famous for, is global technology companies.
Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Company
Search for science and technology companies in Hainan who have also posted job adverts
for penetration testers and you will quickly find 海南仙盾科技开发有限公司, the Hainan
Xiandun Technology Development Company. A job advert for a penetration tester position at
Hainan Xiandun posted on the the Sichuan University Faculty of Computer Science website
on 5 January 2018 describes Hainan Xiandun as a “fast-growing high-tech information
security company”.

Advert for Hainan Xiandun
Here is a second advert for the same company from the College of Foreign Languages at
Hainan University advertising for female English translators, ideally party members:

Second advert for Hainan Xiandun
However, multiple other technology companies based in Hainan use identical company
descriptions and job adverts.
Hainan Yili Technology Company
Hainan Yili – 海南毅立科技有限公司 – describes itself as a fast growing, high-tech
information security company which is committed to becoming a leading manufacturer of
information security products and services in China.

Advert for Hainan Yili Technology Co Ltd
Hainan Tengyuan Technology Company
Hainan Tengyuan – 海南腾远科技有限公司 – also describes itself as a fast growing, hightech information security company which is committed to becoming a leading manufacturer
of information security products and services in China.

Hainan Kehua Information Technology Company
And that’s not all. Hainan Kehua – 海南科华信息科技有限公司 – also describes itself as a
fast growing, high-tech information security company which is committed to becoming a
leading manufacturer of information security products and services in China.

Hainan Yanwu Technology Development Company
A little more research uncovers Hainan Yanwu – 海南彦武科技开发有限公司 – a company
which also describes itself as a fast growing, high-tech information security company which
has become a leading provider of information security services in China.

Of course, this could all be a coincidence. Perhaps this company description is the first result
on Baidu for “how should I describe my new technology company”. But it isn’t.

More links emerge
More links are evident in these job adverts. A Hainan Xiandun advert for an English
translator lists 3414477607[at]qq.com as the contact email.

This is the same email address that was seen on the advert for a Network Security
Development Engineer for Hainan Yili above:

There are more links; the contact person Wang Tian (王天) from the job advert above can
also be seen on this advert for Hainan Tengyuan:

Eight other linked technology companies in Hainan
Five companies with overlapping contact details, job and company profiles, and named
individuals. This is a little suspicious, but there might remain a chance that it is all completely
explainable. Thirteen companies though starts to move beyond even the broadest realms of
credulity and positive thinking. Taking the registration details for Hainan Tengyuan we can
then find a further eight linked technology companies in Hainan.

Registration details for Hainan Tengyuan showing phone number and address at 10 Haixiu
Road
Company 6: Hainan Dingwei Digital Technology Company shares a telephone number
and address with Hainan Tengyuan – 19808984669 and No. 10 Haixiu Road
Company 7: Haikou Fengshang Digital Technology Company shares a telephone
number and address with Hainan Tengyuan and Hainan Dingwei.
Company 8: Hainan Hualian Anshi Intelligence Engineering Company shares a
telephone number and address with Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Dingwei, Haikou
Fengshang.
Company 9: Hainan Jiaxi Technology Company shares a telephone number and
address with Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Dingwei, Haikou Fengshang, and Hainan
Hualian Anshi.
Company 10: Hainan Xinhuaheng Technology Company shares a telephone number
(19808984***) with Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Dingwei, Haikou Fengshang, Hainan
Hualian Anshi, and Hainan Jiaxi and and is co-located in the same building.
Company 11: Haikou Jianhui Li Network Technology Company shares a shareholder
with Hainan Xiandun (Fu Chuanli – 符传礼).
Company 12: Hainan Xin Yousheng Digital Technology Company shares a legal
representative and shareholder with Hainan Dingwei (Fu Zhidao – 符致道 and Wu
Chunai – 吴春爱), shares a telephone number with Hainan Tengyuan, and is also
located at No. 10 Haixiu Road.

Company 13: Haikou Xindahai Computer Technology Company shares a shareholder
with Hainan Hualian Anshi and Hainan Jiaxi (Fu Deqing – 符德清 and Wu Li – 吴丽）
and is also located at No. 10 Haixiu Road.

Hainan cover companies recruiting for offensive cyber skills
Looking beyond the linked contact details though, some of the skills that these adverts are
seeking are on the aggressive end of the spectrum. While the companies stress that they are
committed to information security and cyber-defence, the technical job adverts that they have
placed seek skills that would more likely be suitable for red teaming and conducting cyberattacks.

It could be argued that SQL injection and other penetration skills could be used for defensive
purposes, to stress test defences for example. But this job advert posted by Hainan
Tengyuan is also looking for someone with a track record of sharing hacking exploits as well
as specific experience with Windows Trojan shellcode development and PE encryption. The
question we should be asking is: who develops their own encrypted executable files?
In summary, we have multiple companies with identical descriptions and job adverts,
overlapping contact details and office locations, but different names, recruiting for
offensive hacking skills. Like Boyusec, Huaying Haitai, Antorsoft, and others, these
companies have very little presence on the Internet outside of these adverts.
We know that these companies are a front for APT activity.
You all know where this story is going, and in the next articles we will show you some
of we got there…
