Updated as of August 6, 2017, 7:45 PM PDT to clarify GhostCtrl's attack vectors.
The information-stealing RETADUP worm that affected Israeli hospitals is actually just part of
an attack that turned out to be bigger than we first thought—at least in terms of impact. It
was accompanied by an even more dangerous threat: an Android malware that can take
over the device.
Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_GHOSTCTRL.OPS /
ANDROIDOS_GHOSTCTRL.OPSA, we’ve named this Android backdoor GhostCtrl as it can
stealthily control many of the infected device’s functionalities.
GhostCtrl was hosted in RETADUP's C&C infrastructure, and the samples we analyzed
masqueraded as a legitimate or popular app that uses the names App, MMS, whatsapp, and
even Pokemon GO. Socially engineered phishing emails were also attack vectors; they had
malicious URLs that led would-be victims to download these apps.
There are three versions of GhostCtrl. The first stole information and controlled some of the
device’s functionalities without obfuscation, while the second added more device features to
hijack. The third iteration combines the best of the earlier versions’ features—and then some.
Based on the techniques each employed, we can only expect it to further evolve.

GhostCtrl is literally a ghost of itself
GhostCtrl is also actually a variant (or at least based on) of the commercially sold,
multiplatform OmniRAT that made headlines in November 2015. It touts that it can remotely
take control of Windows, Linux, and Mac systems at the touch of an Android device’s button
—and vice versa. A lifetime license for an OmniRAT package costs between US $25 and
$75. Predictably OmniRAT cracking tutorials abound in various underground forums, and
some its members even provide patchers for it.
There’s actually a red flag that shows how the malicious APK is an OmniRAT spinoff. Given
that it’s a RAT as a service, this can be modified (or removed) during compilation.

variant (highlighted)
GhostCtrl is hauntingly persistent
When the app is launched, it base64-decodes a string from the resource file and writes it
down, which is actually the malicious Android Application Package (APK).
The malicious APK, after dynamically clicked by a wrapper APK, will ask the user to install it.
Avoiding it is very tricky: even if the user cancels the “ask for install page” prompt, the
message will still pop up immediately. The malicious APK doesn’t have an icon. Once
installed, a wrapper APK will launch a service that would let the main, malicious APK run in
the background:
Figure 2: How the wrapper APK leads to the main APK
The main APK has backdoor functions usually named com.android.engine to mislead the
user into thinking it’s a legitimate system application. The malicious APK will then connect to
the C&C server to retrieve commands via the socket (an endpoint for communication
between machines), new Socket("hef--klife[.]ddns.net", 3176).
GhostCtrl can possess the infected device to do its bidding
The commands from the C&C server are encrypted and locally decrypted by the APK upon
receipt. Interestingly, we also found that the backdoor connects to a domain rather than
directly connecting to the C&C server’s IP address. This can be an attempt to obscure their
traffic. We also found several Dynamic Name Servers (DNS), which at some point led to the
same C&C IP address:
hef--klife[.]ddns[.]net
f--klife[.]ddns[.]net

A notable command contains action code and Object DATA, which enables attackers to
specify the target and content, making this a very flexible malware for cybercriminals. This is
the command that allows attackers to manipulate the device’s functionalities without the
owner’s consent or knowledge.
Here’s a list of some of the action codes and what each does to the device:
ACTION CODE =10, 11: Control the Wi-Fi state
ACTION CODE= 34: Monitor the phone sensors’ data in real time
ACTION CODE= 37: Set phone’s UiMode, like night mode/car mode
ACTION CODE= 41: Control the vibrate function, including the pattern and when it will
vibrate
ACTION CODE= 46: Download pictures as wallpaper
ACTION CODE= 48: List the file information in the current directory and upload it to the
C&C server
ACTION CODE= 49: Delete a file in the indicated directory
ACTION CODE= 50: Rename a file in the indicated directory
ACTION CODE= 51: Upload a desired file to the C&C server
ACTION CODE= 52: Create an indicated directory
ACTION CODE= 60: Use the text to speech feature (translate text to voice/audio)
ACTION CODE= 62: Send SMS/MMS to a number specified by the attacker; the
content can also be customized
ACTION CODE= 68: Delete browser history
ACTION CODE= 70: Delete SMS
ACTION CODE= 74: Download file
ACTION CODE= 75: Call a phone number indicated by the attacker
ACTION CODE= 77: Open activity view-related apps; the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) can also be specified by the attacker (open browser, map, dial view, etc.)
ACTION CODE= 78: Control the system infrared transmitter
ACTION CODE= 79: Run a shell command specified by the attacker and upload the
output result
Another unique C&C command is an integer-type command, which is responsible for stealing
the device’s data. Different kinds of sensitive—and to cybercriminals, valuable—information
will be collected and uploaded, including call logs, SMS records, contacts, phone numbers,
SIM serial number, location, and browser bookmarks.
The data GhostCtrl steals is extensive, compared to other Android info-stealers. Besides the
aforementioned information types, GhostCtrl can also pilfer information like Android OS
version, username, Wi-Fi, battery, Bluetooth, and audio states, UiMode, sensor, data from
camera, browser, and searches, service processes, activity information, and wallpaper.

It can also intercept text messages from phone numbers specified by the attacker. Its most
daunting capability is how it can surreptitiously record voice or audio, then upload it to the
C&C server at a certain time. All the stolen content will be encrypted before they’re uploaded
to the C&C server.

Figure 4: Most of the related function codes for stealing information are in the “transfer”
package.
The other C&C commands are self-defined, such as “account”, “audioManager”, and
“clipboard”. These commands will trigger malicious routines. It’s worth noting that these
aren’t commonly seen in Android RATs:
Clearing/resetting the password of an account specified by the attacker
Getting the phone to play different sound effects
Specify the content in the Clipboard
Customize the notification and shortcut link, including the style and content
Control the Bluetooth to search and connect to another device
Set the accessibility to TRUE and terminate an ongoing phone call
How do GhostCtrl’s versions stack up to each other?
GhostCtrl’s first version has a framework that enables it to gain admin-level privilege. While it
had no function codes at the time, the second version did. The features to be hijacked also
incrementally increased as the malware evolved into its second and third iterations.

GhostCtrl’s second version can also be a mobile ransomware. It can lock the device’s screen
and reset its password, and also root the infected device. It can also hijack the camera,
create a scheduled task of taking pictures or recording video, then surreptitiously upload
them to the C&C server as mp4 files.

The third version of GhostCtrl incorporates obfuscation techniques to hide its malicious
routines, as shown below:
Figure 10: The attack chain of GhostCtrl’s third version
In GhostCtrl’s third version, the wrapper APK first drops a packed APK. The latter unpacks
the main APK, a Dalvik executable (DEX), and an Executable and Linkable Format file
(ELF). The DEX and ELF files decrypt strings and Application Programming Interface (API)
calls in the main malicious APK in runtime. This longwinded attack chain helps make
detection more challenging, exacerbated by the fact that the wrapper APK hides the packed
APK as well as DEX and ELF files in the assets directory.
Mitigation
GhostCtrl’s combination with an information-stealing worm, while potent, is also telling. The
attackers tried to cover their bases, and made sure that they didn’t just infect endpoints. And
with the ubiquity of mobile devices among corporate and everyday end users, GhostCtrl’s
capabilities can indeed deliver the scares.
But more than its impact, GhostCtrl underscores the importance of defense in depth.
Multilayered security mechanisms should be deployed so that the risks to data are better
managed. Some of the best practices that information security professionals and IT/system
administrators can adopt to secure bring-your-own devices (BYOD) include:
Keep the device updated; Android patching is fragmented and organizations may have
custom requirements or configurations needed to keep the device updated, so
enterprises need to balance productivity and security
Apply the principle of least privilege—restrict user permissions for BYOD devices to
prevent unauthorized access and installation of dubious apps
Implement an app reputation system that can detect and block malicious and
suspicious apps
Deploy firewalls, intrusion detection, and prevention systems at both the endpoint and
mobile device levels to preempt the malware’s malicious network activities
Enforce and strengthen your mobile device management policies to further reduce
potential security risks
Employ encryption, network segmentation and data segregation to limit further
exposure or damage to data
Regularly back up data in case of device loss, theft, or malicious encryption
