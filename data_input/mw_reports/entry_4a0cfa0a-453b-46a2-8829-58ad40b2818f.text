Hi Folks, today I want to share a quantitative analysis on a weird return-match by Upatre.
According to Unit42 Upatre is an ancient downloader firstly spotted in 2013 used to inoculate
banking trojans and active up to 2016.

1/5

First discovered in 2013, Upatre is primarily a downloader tool responsible for
delivering additional trojans onto the victim host. It is most well-known for being tied
with the Dyre banking trojan, with a peak of over 250,000 Upatre infections per month
delivering Dyre back in July 2015. In November 2015 however, an organization thought
to be associated with the Dyre operation was raided, and subsequently the usage of
Upatre delivering Dyre dropped dramatically, to less than 600 per month by January
2016.
From PaloAlto Unit42
From 2016 until today I’ve never experienced a new Upatre campaign, or something like
that, but something looks to be changed. Analyzing the Cyber Threats Trends findings (for an
upcoming post) I spotted an interesting revival of the Upatre downloader starting from April
2020. The following image shows what I mean. Zero Upatre findings until April 21 2020 and
almost 50 single detections per day since that date. Those statistics are so strange to me,
that I need to doubt about that. So let’s take a closer look to it and see if there is some
misclassification around.

Upatre Time Distribution
Digging a little bit on that samples by asking a second opinion to VirusTotal it looks like
matches are genuine. In order to verify that “revival”, I firstly have taken some random
samples (with Upatre classification tag) and then verified on VirusTotal the malware
classification and the first submission date. Following an example of the performed checks.
As you might see from the following picture, 9 AV classified that sample as Upatre, so we
might consider not a “false positive” or a “miss-classificated” sample.

Upatre Correct Classification
The following image shows the “First Submission Date” which is aligned to what I’ve seen on
Cyber Threats Trends. If you take some more samples from the following list (IoC Section)
you will probably see much more cases similar to that one. I did many checks and I wasn’t
able to find mismatches at all, so I decided to write up this post about it.

Conclusion
It’s something very interesting, at least to my understanding, to see an ancient downloader
be resumed in such a specific period. Many people starting from April up to today are stuck
at home performing what has been called “quarantine” due to COVID pandemic. Curiously
during the same time, while people are working from home and potentially have much more
free time (since they can’t get out home), this older downloader reappears. Maybe somebody
took advantage from this bad situation to resurrect some old tools stored in dusty external
hard-drive ?
