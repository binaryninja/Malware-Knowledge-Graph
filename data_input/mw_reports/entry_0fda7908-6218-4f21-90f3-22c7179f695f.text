Executive summary
What if defenders could see the future? If they knew an attack was coming, they
could stop it, or at least mitigate its impact and help ensure what they need to
protect most is safe. The fact is, defenders can see what’s on the horizon.
Many clues are out there—and obvious.
Adversaries and nation-state actors already have the
expertise and tools necessary to take down critical
infrastructure and systems and cripple entire regions. But
when news surfaces about disruptive and destructive cyber
attacks—such as those in Ukraine, for example, or elsewhere
in the world—some security professionals might initially think,
“Our company’s market/region/technology environment
wasn’t a target, so, we’re probably not at risk.”

2.

In addition to developing threats that can elude
increasingly sophisticated sandboxing environments
(page 22), malicious actors are widening their embrace
of encryption to evade detection (page 9). Encryption is
meant to enhance security, but it also provides malicious
actors with a powerful tool to conceal command-andcontrol (C2) activity, affording them more time to operate
and inflict damage.

However, by dismissing what seem like distant campaigns,
or allowing the chaos of daily skirmishes with attackers to
consume their attention, defenders fail to recognize the speed
and scale at which adversaries are amassing and refining their
cyber weaponry.

Cybercriminals are also adopting C2 channels that rely
on legitimate Internet services like Google, Dropbox,
and GitHub (see page 24). The practice makes malware
traffic almost impossible to identify.

For years, Cisco has been warning defenders about escalating
cybercriminal activity around the globe. In this, our latest
annual cybersecurity report, we present data and analysis
from Cisco threat researchers and several of our technology
partners about attacker behavior observed over the past 12
to 18 months. Many of the topics examined in the report align
with three general themes:
1.

Adversaries are taking malware to unprecedented
levels of sophistication and impact.
The evolution of malware (page 6) was one of the most
significant developments in the attack landscape in 2017.
The advent of network-based ransomware cryptoworms
eliminates the need for the human element in launching
ransomware campaigns. And for some adversaries, the
prize isn’t ransom, but obliteration of systems and data,
as Nyetya—wiper malware masquerading as ransomware—
proved (see page 6). Self-propagating malware is
dangerous and has the potential to take down the Internet,
according to Cisco threat researchers.

3

Adversaries are becoming more adept at evasion—
and weaponizing cloud services and other
technology used for legitimate purposes.

Also, many attackers are now launching multiple
campaigns from a single domain (page 26) to get
the best return on their investments. They are also
reusing infrastructure resources, such as registrant email
addresses, autonomous system numbers (ASNs),
and nameservers.
3.

Adversaries are exploiting undefended gaps in
security, many of which stem from the expanding
Internet of Things (IoT) and use of cloud services.
Defenders are deploying IoT devices at a rapid pace
but often pay scant attention to the security of these
systems. Unpatched and unmonitored IoT devices
present attackers with opportunities to infiltrate networks
(page 34). Organizations with IoT devices susceptible to
attack also seem unmotivated to speed remediation,
research suggests (page 42). Worse, these organizations
probably have many more vulnerable IoT devices in their
IT environments that they don’t even know about.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | Executive summary

Meanwhile, IoT botnets are expanding along with the
IoT and becoming more mature and automated. As they
grow, attackers are using them to launch more advanced
distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (page 31).
Attackers are also taking advantage of the fact that
security teams are having difficulty defending both
IoT and cloud environments. One reason is the lack of
clarity around who exactly is responsible for protecting
those environments (see page 42).
Recommendations for defenders
When adversaries inevitably strike their organizations, will
defenders be prepared, and how quickly can they recover?
Findings from the Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study—which offers insights on security practices
from more than 3600 respondents across 26 countries—show
that defenders have a lot of challenges to overcome (see
page 46).
Even so, defenders will find that making strategic security
improvements and adhering to common best practices can
reduce exposure to emerging risks, slow attackers’ progress,
and provide more visibility into the threat landscape. They
should consider:
•• Implementing first-line-of-defense tools that can scale,
like cloud security platforms.
•• Confirming that they adhere to corporate policies and
practices for application, system, and appliance patching.

•• Adopting next-generation endpoint process
monitoring tools.
•• Accessing timely, accurate threat intelligence data and
processes that allow for that data to be incorporated into
security monitoring and eventing.
•• Performing deeper and more advanced analytics.
•• Reviewing and practicing security response procedures.
•• Backing up data often and testing restoration
procedures—processes that are critical in a world of
fast-moving, network-based ransomware worms and
destructive cyber weapons.
•• Reviewing third-party efficacy testing of security
technologies to help reduce the risk of supply
chain attacks.
•• Conducting security scanning of microservice, cloud
service, and application administration systems.
•• Reviewing security systems and exploring the use of
SSL analytics—and, if possible, SSL decryption.
Defenders should also consider adopting advanced
security technologies that include machine learning and
artificial intelligence capabilities. With malware hiding its
communication inside of encrypted web traffic, and rogue
insiders sending sensitive data through corporate cloud
systems, security teams need effective tools to prevent or
detect the use of encryption for concealing malicious activity.

•• Employing network segmentation to help reduce
outbreak exposures.

About the report
The Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report presents our latest security industry advances designed to help organizations and
users defend against attacks. We also look at the techniques and strategies that adversaries use to break through those defenses
and evade detection.
The report also highlights major findings from the Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study, which examines the security
posture of enterprises and their perceptions of their preparedness to defend against attacks.

The attack landscape

Part I: The attack landscape
Adversaries are taking malware to unprecedented levels of sophistication and
impact. The growing number and variety of malware types and families perpetuate
chaos in the attack landscape by undermining defenders’ efforts to gain and hold
ground on threats.

THE EVOLUTION OF MALWARE

One of the most important developments in the attack landscape in 2017 was the evolution of ransomware. The
advent of network-based ransomware worms eliminates the need for the human element in launching ransomware
campaigns. And for some adversaries, the prize isn’t ransom, but the destruction of systems and data. We expect to
see more of this activity in the year ahead.

They’re out there: Defenders should prepare to face new, self-propagating,
network-based threats in 2018
In 2017, adversaries took ransomware to a new level—
although it had been expected. After the SamSam campaign
of March 20161—the first large-scale attack that used the
network vector to spread ransomware, thereby removing the
user from the infection process—Cisco threat researchers
knew it would only be a matter of time before threat actors
found a way to automate this technique. Attackers would
make their malware even more potent by combining it with
“worm-like” functionality to cause widespread damage.
This malware evolution was swift. In May 2017, WannaCry—
a ransomware cryptoworm—emerged and spread like wildfire
across the Internet.2 To propagate, it took advantage of a
Microsoft Windows security vulnerability called EternalBlue,
which was leaked by the hacker group Shadow Brokers in
mid-April 2017.
WannaCry had earned more than US$143,000 through bitcoin
payments at the point the wallets were cashed out. Given the
timeline, and calculating accrual of the value on the bitcoin
originally paid into the wallets at $93,531, Cisco threat

researchers estimate that roughly 312 ransom payments
were made. As a comparison, the exploit kit Angler, when
it was active, was earning about $100 million per year as a
global business.
WannaCry did not track encrypted damage to and the
payments made by affected users. The number of users
who received decryption keys after making a payment is also
unknown. (WannaCry is still propagating, and users continue
to pay ransoms—in vain.) Due to the very low performance
of WannaCry as ransomware, the U.S. government and
many security researchers believe the ransom component
is effectively a smokescreen to conceal WannaCry’s true
purpose: wiping data.
Nyetya (also known as NotPetya) arrived in June 2017.3
This wiper malware also masqueraded as ransomware and it
too used the remote code execution vulnerability nicknamed
“EternalBlue,” as well as the remote code execution
vulnerability “EternalRomance” (also leaked by Shadow
Brokers), and other vectors involving credential harvesting

unrelated to the Shadow Brokers release.4 Nyetya was
deployed through software update systems for a tax software
package used by more than 80 percent of companies in the
Ukraine, and installed on more than 1 million computers.5
Ukraine cyber police confirmed that it affected more than
2000 Ukrainian companies.6
Before the rise of self-propagating ransomware, malware
was distributed in three ways: drive-by download, email, or
physical media such as malicious USB memory devices. All
methods required some type of human interaction to infect a
device or system with ransomware. With these new vectors
being employed by attackers, an active and unpatched
workstation is all that is needed to launch a network-based
ransomware campaign.
Security professionals may see worms as an “old” type
of threat because the number of worm-like Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) has declined as product
security baselines have improved. However, self-propagating
malware not only is a relevant threat, but also has the
potential to bring down the Internet, according to Cisco threat
researchers. WannaCry and Nyetya are only a taste of what’s
to come, so defenders should prepare.
WannaCry and Nyetya could have been prevented, or their
impact muted, if more organizations had applied basic
security best practices such as patching vulnerabilities,
establishing appropriate processes and policies for incident
response, and employing network segmentation.

Defense in the Ransomware Age on the Cisco Talos blog.

Security weak spot: the supply chain
The Nyetya campaign was also a supply chain attack, one of
many that Cisco threat researchers observed in 2017. One
reason Nyetya was successful at infecting so many machines
so quickly is that users did not see an automated software
update as a security risk, or in some cases even realize that
they were receiving the malicious updates.
Another supply chain attack, which occurred in September
2017, involved the download servers used by a software
vendor to distribute a legitimate software package known
as CCleaner.7 CCleaner’s binaries, which contained a Trojan
backdoor, were signed using a valid certificate, giving users
false confidence that the software they were using was
secure. The actors behind this campaign were targeting major
technology companies where the software was in use, either
legitimately or as part of shadow IT.
Supply chain attacks appear to be increasing in velocity and
complexity. They can impact computers on a massive scale,
and can persist for months or even years. Defenders should
be aware of the potential risk of using software or hardware
from organizations that do not have a responsible security
posture. Look for vendors that issue CVEs, are quick to
address vulnerabilities, and consistently strive to ensure that
their build systems can’t be compromised. Also, users should
take time to scan new software before downloading it to verify
that it doesn’t contain malware.
Network segmentation of software that is not backed by a
comprehensive security practice can help contain damage
from supply chain attacks, preventing them from spreading
throughout an organization.

Why integrity in threat intelligence reporting matters
All organizations that share threat information to customers or
the public through any channel should employ guidelines that
help them ensure accuracy in their reporting. Even if all the
facts aren’t clear, organizations can still communicate what
they know—and avoid guessing. Being right is better than
being first.

the WannaCry campaign were likely spam emails from the
Necurs bot that were spreading “Jaff” ransomware. It was
several days before the security community was in agreement
that the suspicious emails contained Jaff—not WannaCry. And
during that time, users were acting on information that could
not help them to avoid the fast-moving WannaCry campaign.

For example, when the WannaCry attack unfolded in
May 2017, there was initial confusion within the security
community about how the ransomware worm was infiltrating
systems. Multiple organizations in both the public and private
sector were reporting that the attack stemmed from a
phishing campaign and malicious email attachment. But the
network-based threat was, in fact, scanning for and infecting
vulnerable, public-facing Microsoft Windows Server Message
Block (SMB) Server ports.

The chaos following the advent of the WannaCry campaign
serves as a reminder that the security community must avoid
communicating inaccurate facts about the origin and nature
of cyber attacks. In the early hours of a campaign, the sense
of urgency to quickly stop adversaries and protect users can
easily result in the publishing—especially on social media—of
information that may create confusion and prevent users from
defending their systems.

Cisco threat researchers quickly alerted the security
community that the emails they thought were connected to

ENCRYPTED MALICIOUS WEB TRAFFIC

The expanding volume of encrypted web traffic—both legitimate and malicious—creates even more challenges and
confusion for defenders trying to identify and monitor potential threats. Encryption is meant to enhance security,
but it also provides malicious actors with a powerful tool to conceal command-and-control (C2) activity, affording
them more time to operate and inflict damage. Cisco threat researchers expect to see adversaries increase their use
of encryption in 2018. To keep pace, defenders will need to incorporate more automation and advanced tools like
machine learning and artificial intelligence to complement threat prevention, detection, and remediation.

A dark spot for defenders: encrypted malicious web traffic
Cisco threat researchers report that 50 percent of global web
traffic was encrypted as of October 2017. That is a 12-point
increase in volume from November 2016 (see Figure 1). One
factor driving that increase is the availability of low-cost or
free SSL certificates. Another is Google Chrome’s steppedup practice of flagging unencrypted websites that handle
sensitive information, like customers’ credit card information,
as “non-secure.” Businesses are motivated to comply with
Google’s HTTPS encryption requirement unless they want
to risk a potentially significant drop in their Google search
page rankings.

As the volume of encrypted global web traffic grows,
adversaries appear to be widening their embrace of
encryption as a tool for concealing their C2 activity. Cisco
threat researchers observed a more than threefold increase
in encrypted network communication used by inspected
malware samples over a 12-month period (see Figure 2). Our
analysis of more than 400,000 malicious binaries found that
about 70 percent had used at least some encryption as of
October 2017.

Applying machine learning to the threat spectrum

variations of known threats, malware subfamilies, or related
new threats) and “unknown-unknown” (net-new malware)
threats. The technology can learn to identify unusual patterns
in large volumes of encrypted web traffic and automatically
alert security teams to the need for further investigation.

To overcome the lack of visibility that encryption creates,
and reduce adversaries’ time to operate, we see more
enterprises exploring the use of machine learning and artificial
intelligence. These advanced capabilities can enhance
network security defenses and, over time, “learn” how to
automatically detect unusual patterns in web traffic that might
indicate malicious activity.

That latter point is especially important, given that the lack
of trained personnel is an obstacle to enhancing security
defenses in many organizations, as seen in findings from
the Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study
(see page 35). Automation and intelligent tools like machine
learning and artificial intelligence can help defenders
overcome skills and resource gaps, making them more
effective at identifying and responding to both known and
emerging threats.

Machine learning is useful for automatically detecting
“known-known” threats—the types of infections that have
been seen before (see Figure 3). But its real value, especially
in monitoring encrypted web traffic, stems from its ability
to detect “known-unknown” threats (previously unseen

Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study: Defenders report greater reliance
on automation and artificial intelligence
Chief information security officers (CISOs) interviewed for the
Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study report that
they are eager to add tools that use artificial intelligence and
machine learning, and believe their security infrastructure is
growing in sophistication and intelligence. However, they are
also frustrated by the number of false positives such systems
generate, since false positives increase the security team’s
workload. These concerns should ease over time as machine
learning and artificial intelligence technologies mature and
learn what is “normal” activity in the network environments
they are monitoring.

When asked which automated technologies their organizations
rely on the most, 39 percent of security professionals said
they are completely reliant on automation, while 34 percent
are completely reliant on machine learning; 32 percent said
they are completely reliant on artificial intelligence (Figure 4).
Behavior analytics tools are also considered useful when
locating malicious actors in networks; 92 percent of security
professionals said these tools work very to extremely well
(Figure 5).

Web attack methods show adversaries’ intense focus on browser compromise
An analysis of web attack methods over an 18-month period
from April 2016 to October 2017 shows an increase in
adversaries’ use of malicious web content (Figure 6). That
trend aligns with the aggressive targeting of the Microsoft
Internet Explorer web browser by still-active exploit kits.

Cisco threat researchers observed that the number of
detections of malicious JavaScript web content was significant
and consistent during this period. That underscores the
effectiveness of this strategy for infecting vulnerable browsers
to facilitate other nefarious activity such as browser redirection
or Trojan downloads.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

Figure 7 is an overview of web attack methods over a threeyear period, from October 2014 to October 2017. Adversaries
consistently employed suspicious binaries during this period,
primarily to deliver adware and spyware. As discussed in the
Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report, these types of
potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) can present security

risks, such as increased malware infections and theft of user
or company information.8
The three-year view in Figure 7 also shows that the volume
of malicious web content fluctuates over time as attackers
launch and end campaigns and change their tactics to
evade detection.

EMAIL THREATS

No matter how much the threat landscape changes, malicious email and spam remain vital tools for adversaries to
distribute malware because they take threats straight to the endpoint. By applying the right mix of social engineering
techniques, such as phishing and malicious links and attachments, adversaries need only to sit back and wait for
unsuspecting users to activate their exploits.

Fluctuations in spam botnet activity impact overall volume
In late 2016, Cisco threat researchers observed a noticeable
increase in spam campaign activity that appeared to coincide
with a decline in exploit kit activity. When leading exploit
kits like Angler abruptly disappeared from the market, many
users of those kits turned—or returned—to the email vector

to maintain profitability.9 However, after that initial rush back
to email, global spam volume declined and leveled during
most of the first half of 2017. Then, in late May and early June
2017, global spam volume dipped before spiking considerably
during mid- to late summer (see Figure 8).

The reduced spam volume from January through April 2017
coincides with a lull in spam botnet activity, as an internal
graph generated by the Cisco® SpamCop service shows
(Figure 9).
Cisco threat researchers report that the Necurs botnet, a
major contributor to overall spam volume globally, was active
but distributing less spam during the January to April time
frame. In May, the botnet was spreading Jaff ransomware
through massive spam campaigns. The campaigns featured

document, and the initial downloader for the Jaff ransomware.10
Security researchers discovered a vulnerability in Jaff that
allowed them to create a decryptor that forced Necurs’
operators to make a quick return to distributing its usual
threat, Locky ransomware.11 The time that the actors behind
Necurs needed to pivot back to Locky coincides with the
significant dip in global spam volume observed during the first
two weeks of June (Figure 9).

Malicious file extensions in email: common malware families’ top 10 tools
Cisco threat researchers analyzed email telemetry from
January through September 2017 to identify the types of
malicious file extensions in email documents that common
malware families employed most often. The analysis yielded
a top 10 list that shows the most prevalent group of malicious
file extensions (38 percent) was Microsoft Office formats such
as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel (see Figure 10).
Archive files, such as .zip and .jar, accounted for about 37
percent of all the malicious file extensions observed in our
study. That adversaries heavily employ archive files is not
surprising, as they have long been favored hiding places
for malware. Users must open archive files to see the
contents—an important step in the infection chain for many
threats. Malicious archive files also often find success in
foiling automated analysis tools, especially when they contain
threats that require user interaction for activation. Adversaries
will also use obscure file types, such as .7z and .rar, to
evade detection.
Malicious PDF file extensions rounded out the top three in
our analysis, accounting for nearly 14 percent of malicious
file extensions observed. (Note: The category of “Other
Extensions” applies to extensions observed in our study that
could not be mapped easily to known file types. Some malware
types are known to use random file extensions.)

Figures 11a-c provide an overview of the malware families
included in our investigation that were associated with the top
three malicious file extension types: MS Office files, archives,
and PDFs. Figure 12 shows the percentage of detections,
by family, that included a malicious payload file extension.
The spikes in activity align with spam campaigns observed
during those months, according to Cisco threat researchers.

For example, in late summer, there were major campaigns
underway distributing Nemucod and Locky—two threats that
often work together. Nemucod is known to send malicious
payloads in archive files like .zip that contain malicious script
but look like normal .doc files. (“Dwnldr,” also seen in Figure
12, is a likely variant of Nemucod.)

The “other extensions” group in our study includes several
well-known malware types. But MyWebSearch, a malicious
adware software and browser hijacker that poses as a helpful
toolbar, is the most active player (see Figure 13). It uses
.exe file extensions exclusively, sometimes only one type per
month. The potentially unwanted application (PUA) has been
around for years and infects different browser types. It is often
bundled with fraudulent software programs and can expose
users to malvertising.

Social engineering still a critical launchpad for email attacks
Phishing and spear phishing are well-worn tactics for stealing
users’ credentials and other sensitive information, and that’s
because they are very effective. In fact, phishing and spear
phishing emails were at the root of some of the biggest,
headline-grabbing breaches in recent years. Two examples
from 2017 include a widespread attack that targeted Gmail
users12 and a hack of Irish energy systems.13

To gauge how prevalent phishing URLs and domains are on
today’s Internet, Cisco threat researchers examined data
from sources that investigate potentially “phishy” emails
submitted by users through community-based, anti-phishing
threat intelligence. Figure 14 shows the number of phishing
URLs and phishing domains observed during the period from
January to October 2017.

The spikes seen in March and June can be attributed to two
different campaigns. The first appeared to target users of a
major telecom services provider. That campaign:
•• Involved 59,651 URLs containing subdomains under
aaaainfomation[dot]org.
•• Had subdomains that contained random strings consisting
of 50-62 letters.

Each subdomain length (50-62) contained about 3500 URLs,
which allowed for programmatic use of the subdomains
(example: Cewekonuxykysowegulukozapojygepuqybyteqe
johofopefogu[dot]aaaainfomation[dot]org).
Adversaries used an inexpensive privacy service to register
the domains observed in this campaign.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

In the second campaign, which was most active in June,
threat actors used the name of a legitimate tax agency in the
United Kingdom to disguise their actions. They employed 12
top-level domains (TLDs). Eleven of the domains were URLs with
six random six-character strings (example: jyzwyp[dot]top). And
nine of the domains were associated with more than 1600
phishing sites each.
Like the March campaign, adversaries registered the domains
using a privacy service to conceal domain registration
information. They registered all the domains over a two-day
period. On the second day, nearly 19,000 URLs connected to
the campaign were observed, and all were discovered within

a five-hour window (for more on how quickly threat actors
put newly registered domains to use, see “Malicious use of
legitimate resources for backdoor C2,” on page 24).
TLD distribution across known phishing sites
Our analysis of phishing sites during the period from January
to August 2017 found that threat actors were employing 326
unique TLDs for these activities, including .com, .org, .top
(largely due to the United Kingdom taxing agency campaign),
and country-specific TLDs (see Figure 15). Employing lesserknown TLDs can be advantageous for adversaries; these
domains are typically inexpensive and often offer inexpensive
privacy protection.

Defenders should be vigilant in monitoring this “old” threat
In 2017, tens of thousands of phishing attempts were
reported monthly to the community-based, anti-phishing
threat intelligence services included in our analysis. Some
of the common tactics and tools adversaries use to execute
phishing campaigns include:
•• Domain squatting: Domains named to look like valid
domains (example: cisc0[dot]com).
•• Domain shadowing: Subdomains added under a valid
domain without the owner’s knowledge (example:
badstuff[dot]cisco[dot]com).
•• Maliciously registered domains: A domain created to
serve malicious purposes (example: viqpbe[dot]top).

Note: In the data we examined, Bitly.com was the
URL-shortening tool adversaries used most. Malicious
shortened URLs represented 2 percent of the phishing
sites in our study. That number peaked to 3.1 percent
in August.
•• Subdomain services: A site created under a subdomain
server (example: mybadpage[dot]000webhost[dot]com).
Threat actors in the phishing and spear phishing game are
continuously refining social engineering methods to trick
users into clicking malicious links or visiting fraudulent web
pages, and providing credentials or other types of highvalue information. User training and accountability, and the
application of email security technologies, remain crucial
strategies for combatting these threats.

•• URL shorteners: A malicious URL disguised with a URL
shortener (example: bitly[dot]com/random-string).

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

SANDBOX EVASION TACTICS

Adversaries are becoming adept at developing threats that can evade increasingly sophisticated sandboxing
environments. When Cisco threat researchers analyzed malicious email attachments that were equipped with various
sandbox evasion techniques, they discovered that the number of malicious samples using a particular sandbox
evasion technique showed sharp peaks, and then quickly dropped. This is yet another example of how attackers are
swift to ramp up the volume of attempts to break through defenses once they find an effective technique.

Malware authors playing dirty tricks in defenders’ sandboxes
In September 2017, Cisco threat researchers noted high
volumes of samples where a malicious payload is delivered
after a document is closed (Figure 16). In this case, the
malware is triggered using the “document_close” event. The
technique works because, in many cases, documents are not
closed after the document has been opened and analyzed in
the sandbox. Because the sandbox doesn’t explicitly close the
document, the attachments are deemed safe by the sandbox,
and will be delivered to the intended recipients. When a
recipient opens the document attachment, and later closes

the document, the malicious payload is delivered. Sandboxes
that don’t properly detect actions on document close can be
evaded using this technique.
The use of the “document_close” event is a clever option
for attackers. It takes advantage of the macro functionality
built into Microsoft Office, as well as users’ tendency to
open attachments that they believe are relevant to them.
Once users realize the attachment is not relevant to them,
they close the document, triggering the macros in which the
malware is hidden.

Some attackers evade sandboxing by disguising the type of
document in which the malicious payload exists. As seen in
Figure 17, we noted a significant attack in May 2017 that was
built around malicious Word documents embedded within PDF
documents. The documents might bypass sandboxes that
simply detect and open the PDF, instead of also opening and
analyzing the embedded Word document. The PDF document
typically contained an enticement for the user to click and

open the Word document, which would trigger the malicious
behavior. Sandboxes that don’t open and analyze embedded
documents within PDFs can be bypassed using this technique.
After viewing the spike in malicious samples involving these
PDFs, our threat researchers refined the sandbox environment
to detect whether PDFs contained actions or enticements to
open embedded Word documents.

The spikes in malicious samples using different sandbox
evasion techniques point to malicious actors’ desire to follow
a method that seems to work for them—or for other attackers.
Also, if adversaries go to the trouble of creating malware
and associated infrastructure, they want a return on their
investments. If they determine that malware can slip through
sandbox testing, they will, in turn, increase the number of
attack attempts and affected users.

Cisco researchers recommend using sandboxing that includes
“content-aware” features to help ensure malware that uses
the tactics described above does not evade sandbox analysis.
For example, sandboxing technology should show awareness
of the metadata features of the samples it is analyzing—such
as determining whether the sample includes an action upon
closing of the document.

ABUSE OF CLOUD SERVICES AND OTHER LEGITIMATE RESOURCES

As applications, data, and identities move to the cloud, security teams must manage the risk involved with losing
control of the traditional network perimeter. Attackers are taking advantage of the fact that security teams are having
difficulty defending evolving and expanding cloud and IoT environments. One reason is the lack of clarity around who
exactly is responsible for protecting those environments.
To meet this challenge, enterprises may need to apply a combination of best practices, advanced security
technologies like machine learning, and even some experimental methodologies, depending on the services they use
for their business and how threats in this space evolve.

Malicious use of legitimate resources for backdoor C2
When threat actors use legitimate services for command
and control (C2), malware network traffic becomes nearly
impossible for security teams to identify because it mimics the
behavior of legitimate network traffic. Adversaries have a lot
of Internet “noise” to use as cover because so many people
today rely on services like Google Docs and Dropbox to do
their work, regardless of whether these services are offered
or systemically endorsed by their employers.

Figure 18 shows several of the well-known legitimate
services that researchers with Anomali, a Cisco partner and
threat intelligence provider, have observed being used in
malware backdoor C2 schemas14 in the last few years. (Note:
These types of services face a dilemma in combatting abuse,
as making it more difficult for users to set up accounts and
use their services can adversely affect their ability to
generate revenue.)

14 Anomali defines a C2 schema as “the totality of IP addresses, domains, legitimate services, and all the remote systems that are part of the … communications architecture” of malware.

24

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

According to Anomali’s research, advanced persistent
threat (APT) actors and state-sponsored groups were
among the first adversaries to use legitimate services for
C2; however, the technique is now embraced by a broader
range of sophisticated adversaries in the shadow economy.
Using legitimate services for C2 appeals to malicious actors
because it’s easy to:
•• Register new accounts on these services.
•• Set up a web page on the publicly accessible Internet.
•• Usurp encryption for C2 protocols. (Instead of setting up
C2 servers with encryption or building encryption into
malware, attackers can simply adopt the SSL certificate
of a legitimate service.)
•• Adapt and transform resources on the fly. (Attackers can
reuse implants across attacks without reusing DNS or IP
addresses, for instance.)
•• Reduce the likelihood of “burning” infrastructure.
(Adversaries that use legitimate services for C2 don’t
need to hard-code malware with IP addresses or
domains. When their operation is complete, they can
simply take down their legitimate services pages—and no
one will ever know the IP addresses.)
•• Attackers benefit from this technique because it allows
them to reduce overhead and improve their return
on investment.
For defenders, adversaries’ use of legitimate services for C2
presents some significant challenges:
Legitimate services are difficult to block
Can organizations, from a mere business perspective, even
consider blocking parts of legitimate Internet services like
Twitter or Google?

Legitimate services are often encrypted and innately
difficult to inspect
SSL decrypting is expensive and not always possible at
enterprise scale. So, malware hides its communication inside
of encrypted traffic, making it difficult, if not impossible, for
security teams to identify malicious traffic.
Use of legitimate services subverts domain and certificate
intelligence, and complicates attribution
Adversaries don’t need to register domains because the
legitimate service account is considered the initial C2 address.
Also, they’re not likely to continue registering SSL certificates
or using self-signed SSL certificates for C2 schemas. Both
trends obviously will have a negative impact on indicator feeds
for reputation filtering and indicator blacklisting, which are
based on newly generated and newly registered domains and
the certificates and IP addresses connected to them.
Detecting the use of legitimate services for C2 is difficult.
However, Anomali’s threat researchers recommend that
defenders consider applying some experimental methodologies.
For example, defenders may identify malware using legitimate
services for C2 by looking for:
•• Non-browser, non-app connections to legitimate services
•• Unique or low page response sizes from
legitimate services
•• High certificate exchange frequencies to
legitimate services
•• Bulk sandboxing samples for suspicious DNS calls to
legitimate services
All these unique behaviors merit further investigation of the
source programs and processes.15

15 For details on these experimental methodologies, and more information about how adversaries use legitimate services for C2, download the Anomali research paper,
Rise of Legitimate Services for Backdoor Command and Control, available at: anomali.cdn.rackfoundry.net/files/anomali-labs-reports/legit-services.pdf.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

Extracting optimal value from resources
Cisco security researchers analyzed newly seen unique query
names (domains) associated with DNS queries made over a
seven-day period in August 2017. Note that “newly seen”
in this discussion has no bearing on when a domain was
created; it relates to when a domain was first “seen” by Cisco
cloud security technology during the period of observation.
The purpose of this research was to gain more insight into how
often adversaries use, and reuse, registered-level domains
(RLDs) in their attacks. Understanding threat actor behavior
at the domain level can help defenders identify malicious
domains, and related subdomains, that should be blocked with
first-line-of-defense tools like cloud security platforms.
So that our researchers could focus solely on the core group
of unique RLDs—about 4 million in total—subdomains were
stripped from the sample of newly seen domains. Only a small
percentage of the RLDs in that sample was categorized as
malicious. Of the RLDs that were malicious, more than half
(about 58 percent) were reused, as Figure 19 shows.

Figure 19 Percentage of new vs. reused domains
Figure 19 Percent of new vs. reused domains

That finding suggests that, while most attackers build new
domains for their campaigns, many are focused on trying to
get the best return on their investments by launching multiple
campaigns from a single domain. Domain registration can
be costly, especially at the scale most attackers require to
execute their campaigns and evade detection.
One-fifth of malicious domains quickly put into use
Adversaries may sit on domains for days, months, or even
years after registering them, waiting for the right time to
use them. However, Cisco threat researchers observed that
a significant percentage of malicious domains—about 20
percent—were used in campaigns less than one week after
they were registered (see Figure 20).

Many new domains tied to malvertising campaigns
Most malicious domains we analyzed were associated with
spam campaigns—about 60 percent. Nearly one-fifth of the
domains were connected to malvertising campaigns (see
Figure 21). Malvertising has become an essential tool for
directing users to exploit kits, including those that
distribute ransomware.

Figure 21 Malicious categorizations

Figure 21 Malicious categorizations

in new domains and preserve resources, according to our
researchers. For example, an IP address can be used by more
than one domain. So, an attacker laying the groundwork for a
campaign might decide to invest in a few IP addresses and an
array of domain names instead of servers, which cost more.

Well-worn, domain-related techniques for creating
malvertising campaigns include domain shadowing. In
this technique, attackers steal legitimate domain account
credentials to create subdomains directed at malicious
servers. Another tactic is the abuse of free, dynamic DNS
services to generate malicious domains and subdomains.
That allows threat actors to deliver malicious payloads from
constantly changing hosting IPs, either infected users’
computers or compromised public websites.

adversaries trying to get the most value from their investments

Used Multiple Times

Used Once

The resources that RLDs reuse give clues to whether the
domain is likely to be malicious. For example, reuse of
registrant emails or IP addresses occurs infrequently, so a
pattern of reuse on either front suggests suspicious behavior.
Defenders can have a high degree of confidence in blocking
those domains, knowing that doing so probably will have no
negative impact on business activity.

subdomains can help security teams follow the trail of an
attacker and answer questions, such as:

Static blocking of ASNs and nameservers is not likely to be
feasible in most cases. However, patterns of reuse by RLDs
are worthy of further investigation to determine whether
certain domains should be blocked.

The answers can help defenders not only refine security
policies and block attacks, but also prevent users from
connecting to malicious destinations on the Internet while
they’re on the enterprise network.

•• What IP address does the domain resolve to?
•• What ASN is associated with that IP address?
•• Who registered the domain?
•• What other domains are associated with that domain?

Using intelligent, first-line-of-defense cloud security tools
to identify and analyze potentially malicious domains and

DevOps technologies at risk for ransomware attacks
2017 saw the emergence of DevOps ransomware attacks,
beginning with a campaign in January that targeted opensource database platform, MongoDB.16 Attackers encrypted
public MongoDB instances and demanded ransom payments
for decryption keys and software. Soon after, they set their
sights on compromising databases, such as CouchDB and
Elasticsearch, with server-targeted ransomware.
Rapid7 is a Cisco partner and provider of security data and
analytics solutions. As Rapid7 researchers explained in our
Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report, DevOps services
are often deployed improperly, or left open intentionally for
convenient access by legitimate users—leaving these services
open for attack.
Rapid7 performs regular Internet sweeps for DevOps
technologies and catalogs both open instances and ransomed
instances. Some of the DevOps services they encounter during

their sweeps may contain personally identifiable information
(PII), based on the names of the tables exposed to the Internet.
To reduce their risk of exposure to DevOps ransomware
attacks, organizations that use public Internet instances of
DevOps technologies should:
•• Develop solid standards for secure deployment of
DevOps technologies
•• Maintain active awareness of public infrastructure used by
the company
•• Keep DevOps technologies up to date and patched
•• Conduct vulnerability scans
For more details on Rapid7’s research, see “Don’t let
DevOps technologies leave the business exposed,” in the
Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report.

of OAuth permissions and super-user privileges to enforce
who can enter networks, and how they can access data.17
To further examine the impact of user activity on security,
Cisco threat researchers recently examined data exfiltration
trends. They employed a machine-learning algorithm to
profile 150,000 users in 34 countries, all using cloud service
providers, from January to June 2017. The algorithm
accounted for not only the volume of documents being
downloaded, but also variables such as the time of day of
downloads, IP addresses, and locations.
After profiling users for six months, our researchers spent 1.5
months studying abnormalities. flagging 0.5 percent of users
for suspicious downloads. That’s a small amount, but these
users downloaded, in total, more than 3.9 million documents
from corporate cloud systems, or an average of 5200
documents per user during the 1.5-month period. Of the
suspicious downloads, 62 percent occurred outside of normal
work hours; 40 percent took place on weekends.

One of the most popular keywords in the documents’ titles
was “data.” The keywords most commonly appearing with the
word “data” were “employee” and “customer.” Of the types
of documents downloaded, 34 percent were PDFs and 31
percent were Microsoft Office documents (see Figure 23).
Applying machine-learning algorithms offers a more
nuanced view of cloud user activity beyond just the number
of downloads. In our analysis, 23 percent of the users we
studied were flagged more than three times for suspicious
downloads, usually starting with small numbers of documents.
The volume slowly increased each time, and eventually, these
users showed sudden and significant spikes in downloads
(Figure 24).
Machine-learning algorithms hold the promise of providing
greater visibility into the cloud and user behavior. If defenders
can start predicting user behavior in terms of downloads,
they can save the time it might take to investigate legitimate
behavior. They can also step in to stop a potential attack or
data-exfiltration incident before it happens.

Cisco researchers also conducted a text-mining analysis on the
titles of the 3.9 million suspiciously downloaded documents.

Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study: Security viewed as a
key benefit of hosting networks in the cloud
The use of on-premises and public cloud infrastructure is
growing, according to the Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study, although many organizations still host
networks on-premises. In the 2017 study, 27 percent of
security professionals said they are using off-premises private
clouds, compared with 25 percent in 2016 and 20 percent in
2015 (Figure 25). Fifty-two percent said their networks are
hosted on-premises as part of a private cloud.

IoT AND DDoS ATTACKS

The IoT is still evolving, but adversaries are already exploiting security weaknesses in IoT devices to gain access to
systems—including industrial control systems that support critical infrastructure. IoT botnets are also growing in both
size and power, and are increasingly capable of unleashing powerful attacks that could severely disrupt the Internet.
Attackers’ shift toward greater exploitation of the application layer indicates that this is their aim. But many security
professionals aren’t aware of, or they dismiss, the threat that IoT botnets pose. Organizations keep adding IoT devices
to their IT environments with little or no thought about security, or worse, take no time to assess how many IoT
devices are touching their networks. In these ways, they’re making it easy for adversaries to take command of the IoT.

Few organizations see IoT botnets as an imminent threat—but they should
As the IoT expands and evolves, so too are IoT botnets. And
as these botnets grow and mature, attackers are using them
to launch DDoS attacks of increasing scope and intensity.
Radware, a Cisco partner, offered an analysis of three of
the largest IoT botnets—Mirai, Brickerbot, and Hajime—in the
Cisco 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report, and revisits the
IoT botnet topic in our latest report to underscore the severity
of this threat.18 Their research shows that only 13 percent of
organizations believe that IoT botnets will be a major threat to
their business in 2018.
IoT botnets are thriving because organizations and users are
deploying low-cost IoT devices rapidly and with little or no
regard for security. IoT devices are Linux- and Unix-based
systems, so they are often targets of executable and linkable
format (ELF) binaries. They are also less challenging to take

control of than a PC, which means it’s easy for adversaries to
quickly build a large army.
IoT devices operate on a 24-hour basis and can be called
into action at a moment’s notice. And as adversaries
increase the size of their IoT botnets, they are investing in
more sophisticated code and malware and shifting to more
advanced DDoS attacks.
Application DDoS overtakes network DDoS
Application layer attacks are on the rise while network layer
attacks are declining (see Figure 28). Radware researchers
suspect this shift can be attributed to growth in IoT botnets.
The trend is concerning because the application layer is so
diverse, and has so many devices within it, which means
attacks targeting this layer could potentially shut down large
portions of the Internet.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

More attackers are turning to the application layer because
there is little left to exploit in the network layer, according to
Radware researchers. IoT botnets are also less resourceintensive than PC botnets to build. That means adversaries
can invest more resources in developing advanced code and
malware. The operators of the multivector botnet Mirai, which
is known for advanced application attacks, are among those
making that type of investment.
“Burst attacks” increasing in complexity, frequency,
and duration
One of the most significant DDoS attack trends Radware
observed in 2017 was an increase in short-burst attacks, which
are becoming more complex, frequent, and persistent. Forty-two
percent of organizations in Radware’s investigation experienced
this type of DDoS attack in 2017 (Figure 29). In most of the
attacks, the recurring bursts lasted only a few minutes.

•• Combine high-volume attacks with varying durations—
from two to 50 seconds of high burst-traffic with intervals
of approximately five to 15 minutes.
•• Are often combined with other long-duration
DDoS attacks.
Growth in reflection amplification attacks
Another DDoS trend Radware observed during 2017 is growth
in reflection amplification DDoS attacks as a major vector
against a wide spectrum of services. According to Radware,
two in five businesses experienced a reflection amplification
attack in 2017. One-third of those organizations reported that
they were unable to mitigate these attacks.
A reflection amplification attack uses a potentially legitimate
third-party component to send attack traffic to a target,
concealing the attacker’s identity. Attackers send packets
to the reflector servers with a source IP address set to the
target user’s IP. That makes it possible to indirectly overwhelm
the target with response packets and exhaust the target’s
utilization of resources (see Figure 30).

Burst tactics are typically aimed at gaming websites and
service providers due to their targets’ sensitivity to service
availability and their inability to sustain such attack maneuvers.
Timely or random bursts of high traffic rates over a period of
days or even weeks can leave these organizations with no
time to respond, causing severe service disruptions.
Radware researchers say that burst attacks:
•• Are composed of multiple changing vectors. The
attacks are geographically distributed and manifest as a
sustained series of precise and high-volume SYN floods,
ACK floods, and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) floods on
multiple ports.

32

Third-Party Component
Source: Radware

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

To successfully execute a reflection amplification attack,
adversaries need to have a larger bandwidth capacity than
their targets. Reflector servers make that possible: the
attacker simply reflects the traffic from one or more thirdparty machines. Since these are ordinary servers, this
type of attack is particularly difficult to mitigate. Common
examples include:
DNS amplification reflective attacks
This sophisticated denial of service attack takes advantage
of a DNS server’s behavior to amplify the attack. A standard
DNS request is smaller than the DNS reply. In a DNS
amplification reflective attack, the attacker carefully selects
a DNS query that results in a lengthy reply that’s up to 80
times longer than the request (for example, “ANY”). The
attacker sends this query using a botnet to third-party
DNS servers while spoofing the source IP address with the
target user’s IP address. The third-party DNS servers send
their responses to the target’s IP address. With this attack
technique, a relatively small botnet can channel a volumetric
flood of large responses toward the target.
NTP reflection
This type of amplification attack exploits publicly accessible
Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers to overwhelm and
exhaust defenders with UDP traffic. NTP is an old networking
protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems
over packet-switched networks. It is still widely used across
the Internet by desktops, servers, and even phones to keep
their clocks in sync. Several old versions of NTP servers
contain a command called monlist, which sends the requester
a list of up to the last 600 hosts that connected to the
queried server.

33

In a basic scenario, the attacker repeatedly sends the “get
monlist” request to a random NTP server and spoofs the
source IP address for the requesting server as the target
server. NTP server responses are then directed to the target
server to cause a significant increase in UDP traffic from
source port 123.
SSDP reflection
This attack exploits the Simple Service Discovery Protocol
(SSDP), which is used to allow Universal-Plug-and-Play
(UPnP) devices to broadcast their existence. It also helps
to enable discovery and control of networked devices and
services, such as cameras, network-attached printers, and
many other types of electronic equipment.
Once a UPnP device is connected to a network, and after
it receives an IP address, the device is able to advertise
its services to other computers in the network by sending
a message in a multicast IP. When a computer gets the
discovery message about the device, it makes a request for a
complete description of the device services. The UPnP device
then responds directly to that computer with a complete list of
any services it has to offer.
As with NTP and DNS amplified DDoS attacks, the attacker can
use a small botnet to query that final request for the services.
The attacker then spoofs the source IP to the target user’s IP
address and aims the responses directly at the target.

Defenders must remediate “leak paths”
A “leak path,” as defined by Cisco partner Lumeta, is a policy
or segmentation violation or unauthorized or misconfigured
connection created to the Internet on an enterprise network,
including from the cloud, that allows traffic to be forwarded
to a location on the Internet—such as a malicious website.
These unexpected connections can also occur internally
between two different network segments that should not
be communicating with each other. For example, in critical
infrastructure environments, an unexpected leak path
between the manufacturing floor and business IT systems
could indicate malicious activity. Leak paths can also stem
from improperly configured routers and switches.
Devices that don’t have permissions set up correctly, or
are left open and unmanaged, are vulnerable to attackers.
Devices and networks related to rogue or shadow IT are also
fertile ground for adversaries to establish leak paths because
they tend to be unmanaged and unpatched. Lumeta estimates

that about 40 percent of the dynamic networks, endpoints,
and cloud infrastructure in enterprises is leading to significant
infrastructure blind spots and lack of real-time awareness for
security teams.
Detection of existing leak paths are critical as they can be
exploited at any time. However, newly created leak paths
are important to detect in real time since they are immediate
indicators of compromise and are associated with most
advanced attacks, including ransomware.
Lumeta’s recent analysis of IT infrastructure at more than
200 organizations across several industries underscores the
endpoint visibility gap. It also shows that many companies
significantly underestimate the number of endpoints in their IT
environments (see Figure 31). Lack of awareness about the
number of IP-enabled IoT devices connected to the network
is often a key reason for underestimation of endpoints.

Lumeta’s researchers suggest that leak paths are on the rise,
especially in cloud environments, where there is less network
visibility and fewer security controls in place.
Malicious actors don’t always immediately use the leak
paths they create or find. When they do return to these
channels, they use them to install malware or ransomware,
steal information, and more. Researchers with Lumeta say
one reason leak paths often remain undetected is because
threat actors are adept at encrypting and obfuscating their
activity—by using TOR, for example. They also are careful to
use leak paths judiciously, so as not to alert security teams
to their activity.

Lumeta researchers say security team skills gaps, namely the
lack of fundamental knowledge about networks, can interfere
with organizations’ ability to investigate and remediate leak
path issues in a timely manner. Better collaboration between
security and network teams can help expedite investigations
and remediation of leak paths.
Tools for automation that provide network context can also
give security analysts insight into potential leak path issues. In
addition, implementing appropriate segmentation policies can
help security teams quickly determine whether unexpected
communication between networks or devices is malicious.

Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study: Lack of security personnel prevents many
organizations from implementing new cyber capabilities
Severe staff shortages remain a major issue for defenders. As
noted above, skills gaps can interfere with an organization’s
ability to investigate and remediate certain types of threats.
Also, without the right talent in place, defenders can’t deploy
new technology and processes that could help to strengthen
their security postures (Figure 32).
Many security professionals interviewed for the Cisco 2018
Security Capabilities Benchmark Study said that, ideally, they
would automate or outsource more of their routine activities,
so they could redirect staff to higher-value activities.

Industrial control systems vulnerabilities place critical infrastructure at risk
Industrial control systems (ICS) are at the heart of all
manufacturing and process control systems. ICS connect to
other electronic systems that are part of the control process,
creating a highly connected ecosystem of vulnerable devices
that a wide range of attackers is eager to compromise.
Threat actors who want to target ICS to cripple critical
infrastructure are actively engaged in research and creating
backdoor pivot points to facilitate future attacks, according
to TrapX Security, a Cisco partner that develops deceptionbased cybersecurity defenses. Among the potential cyber
attackers are experts with advanced knowledge of IT systems,
ICS architectures, and the processes they support. Some also
know how to program product lifecycle management (PLM)
controllers and subsystems.
Threat researchers with TrapX recently conducted
investigations into several cyber attacks that targeted
customers’ ICS to help highlight unexpected problems with
ICS cyber defense. Two of the incidents, described below,
took place in 2017 and remain under investigation.
Target: Large international water treatment and waste
processing company
Attackers used the company’s demilitarized zone (DMZ)
server as a pivot point to compromise the internal network.
The security operations team received alerts from deception
security technology embedded in the network DMZ. This
physical or logical subnetwork bridges internal networks from
untrusted networks, such as the Internet, protecting other
internal infrastructure. The investigation found that:
•• The DMZ server was breached due to a misconfiguration
that allowed RDP connections.

•• The attackers were able to launch multiple major attacks
against several of the company’s other plants from the
compromised internal network.
Target: Power plant
This power plant’s critical assets include a very large ICS
infrastructure and the necessary supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) components that manage and
run their processes. The plant is considered critical national
infrastructure and subject to scrutiny and oversight by the
responsible national security agency. It is therefore considered
a high-security installation.
The CISO involved decided to implement deception
technology to protect the plant’s standard IT resources from
ransomware attacks. The technology was also distributed
within the ICS infrastructure. Soon after, the security
operations team received several alerts that indicated a
breach to the systems within the critical infrastructure plant
operations. Their immediate investigation concluded:
•• A device in the process control network was attempting
to interact with the deception traps, which were
camouflaged as PLM controllers. This was an active
attempt to map and understand the exact nature of each
PLM controller within the network.
•• The compromised device would normally have been
closed, but a vendor performing maintenance failed to
close the connection when finished. That oversight left
the process control network vulnerable to attackers.
•• The information adversaries were collecting is exactly the
type needed to disrupt plant activity and potentially cause
great damage to ongoing plant operations.

•• The server was breached and controlled from several IPs,
which were connected to political hacktivists hostile to
the plant.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

Recommendations
Many ICS breaches begin with the compromise of vulnerable
servers and computing resources within the corporate IT
network. Threat researchers with TrapX recommend that
organizations take the following actions to reduce risk and
help ensure the integrity of operations within their facilities:
•• Review vendors and systems, and see that all patches
and updates are applied promptly. (If patches are not
available, consider migrating to new technology.)
•• Reduce the use of USB memory sticks and DVD drives.
•• Isolate ICS systems from IT networks. Don’t allow any
direct connections between the two. That includes
network connections, laptops, and memory sticks.

•• Implement policies that severely limit the use of the ICS
networks for anything other than essential operations.
Reduce accessibility to ICS workstations and monitors
with external Internet browser access. Assume these
policies will fail and plan accordingly.
•• Research and eliminate all embedded passwords or
default passwords in your production network. And
wherever possible, implement two-factor authentication.
•• Review plans for disaster recovery following a major
cyber attack.
For additional case studies, see the TrapX Security research
paper, Anatomy of an Attack: Industrial Control Systems
Under Siege.

Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study: More OT and IoT attacks on the horizon
Attacks targeting operational technology (OT) such as ICS
and IoT devices are still uncommon enough that many
security professionals haven’t experienced them firsthand.
But according to research for the Cisco 2018 Security
Capabilities Benchmark Study, security professionals fully
expect such attacks to occur, and are trying to determine how
they will respond to them.
Security professionals recognize that these systems often have
few protections and unpatched and out-of-date software,
making them vulnerable to attacks.
“We still have OT devices that are 25 years old, and
compressors and machines that are 40 years old,” said one
respondent. “IT professionals are used to the schedule. [They
say,] ‘Tell me when Windows X is no longer supported,’ or
‘Hey, this Oracle version is going EOL [end of life].’ There’s no
such thing in the OT environment.”
Few security professionals can speak confidently on issues
relating to securing OT in their organizations. That is either
because they don’t have or anticipate adding much OT, or
because IoT implementations are new. Of these professionals, 31
percent said their organizations have already experienced cyber
attacks on OT infrastructure, while 38 percent said they expect
attacks to extend from IT to OT in the next year (Figure 33).

VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHING

Amid the chaos of security concerns, defenders may lose sight of vulnerabilities affecting their technology. But
you can be sure attackers are paying attention, and calculating how to exploit these potential weaknesses to
launch attacks.
There was a time when patching known vulnerabilities within 30 days was considered best practice. Now, waiting
that long to remediate could increase an organization’s risk of being targeted for attack because threat actors are
moving faster to release and use active exploits of vulnerabilities. Organizations also must avoid neglecting small but
significant security gaps that could benefit adversaries, especially during the reconnaissance phase of attacks when
they are searching for pathways into systems.

Prevalent vulnerabilities in 2017 included buffer overflow errors, Apache Struts
Buffer overflow errors topped the list of Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities tracked by Cisco in 2017,

In examining critical advisories (Figure 35), Apache Struts
vulnerabilities were still prominent in 2017. Apache Struts is
an open-source framework for creating Java applications that
is widely used. Apache Struts vulnerabilities were implicated
in security breaches in 2017 that involved major data brokers.

reports,19 third-party or open-source software vulnerabilities
can require manual patching, which may not be done as
frequently as automated patching from standard software
vendors. That gives malicious actors a greater window of time
to launch attacks.

While Apache tends to identify vulnerabilities and offer
patches quickly, infrastructure solutions such as Apache
Struts can be challenging to patch without disrupting network
performance. As discussed in previous Cisco security

Deep scanning of operating systems down to the library or
individual file level can provide organizations with inventories
of the components of open-source solutions.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

IoT and library vulnerabilities loomed larger in 2017
Between October 1, 2016, and September 30, 2017, Cisco
threat researchers discovered 224 new vulnerabilities in nonCisco products, of which 40 vulnerabilities were related to
third-party software libraries included in these products, and
74 were related to IoT devices (Figure 36).
The relatively large number of vulnerabilities in libraries
points to the need to delve deeper into third-party solutions
that provide the framework for many enterprise networks.
Defenders should assume that third-party software libraries
can be targets for attackers; it’s not enough to simply make
sure the latest version of the software is running, or that no
open CVEs (common vulnerabilities) have been reported.
Security teams should check frequently for patches, and
review the security practices of third-party vendors. Teams
could, for example, request that vendors provide secure
development lifecycle statements.
Another best practice for vetting third-party software is
helping to ensure that auto-update or check-for-update
features are running securely. For example, when an update
is initiated, security professionals should be certain that
the communication for that software occurs over a secure
channel (such as SSL), and that the software is digitally

signed. Both are needed: If only digital signatures are used,
but not a secure channel, an attacker could intercept traffic
and potentially replace an update with an older version
of the software that is digitally signed, but may contain
vulnerabilities. If only a secure channel is used, an attacker
could potentially compromise the vendor’s update server and
replace the update with malware.

Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities: proactive preparation can accelerate remediation

40

The January 2018 announcement of the Spectre and Meltdown
vulnerabilities, which could allow attackers to compromise data
on platforms running current-generation computer processors,
raised concerns about security professionals’ ability to protect
data from attacks. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to
view application data in memory on the chipset, with potential
for widespread damage, since affected microprocessors are
found in everything from mobile phones to server hardware.

Organizations need to plan for vulnerabilities like Spectre and
Meltdown to happen, instead of hoping they won’t occur. The
key is preparing for such announcements, and having systems
in place to mitigate potential damage. For example, security
teams should proactively inventory devices under their control,
and document configurations in features in use, as some
vulnerabilities are configuration-dependent and impact security
only when certain features are activated.

The threats posed by the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities
highlight the importance of communicating with security
organizations about solutions such as patches—as well as
ensuring that third-party providers, such as cloud and supply
chain vendors, are adhering to best practices for remediating
gaps in security posed by such vulnerabilities. Product
security incident response teams, or PSIRTs (such as the
Cisco PSIRT), are designed to respond quickly to vulnerability
announcements, provide patches, and advise customers on
how to avoid risks.

Security teams should also ask third-party vendors, such
as cloud providers, about their update and patching
processes. Organizations need to ask for transparency from
their cloud providers in terms of how they remediate such
vulnerabilities, and how quickly they respond to alerts. But
in the end, the responsibility for preparedness falls on the
organizations themselves; they must communicate with PSIRT
organizations, and establish processes for quickly responding
to vulnerabilities.
For more information, read the Talos blog post on Spectre
and Meltdown.

Active exploits fuel race to remediate, except for IoT devices
Qualys, Inc., a Cisco partner and provider of cloud-based
security and compliance solutions, took a retrospective look at
companies’ patch management behavior before and after the
WannaCry campaign that affected many organizations across
the world in May 2017.
The ransomware cryptoworm WannaCry, which many security
experts believe was designed to wipe data, took advantage of
a Microsoft Windows security vulnerability called EternalBlue,
which was leaked by the hacker group Shadow Brokers
in mid-April 2017. (For more on this topic, see “They’re
out there: Defenders should prepare to face new, selfpropagating, network-based threats in 2018,” on page 6.)
On March 14, 2017, Microsoft issued a security update
(MS17-010) alerting users to a critical vulnerability in its
Microsoft Windows SMB Server. Figure 37 shows how the
number of devices detected with the vulnerability spikes, and
then gradually declines between mid-March and mid-April as
organizations scan their systems and apply the patch.

However, a significant number of devices still remained
unpatched as of mid-April. Then, on April 14, Shadow
Brokers released the working exploit for targeting that known
vulnerability in various versions of Microsoft Windows.
Figure 37 shows that the number of devices detected with the
vulnerability nearly doubled shortly thereafter. That happened
as organizations learned of the exploit and its potential to
impact both supported and unsupported versions of Windows
through a remote check from Qualys that used a portion of
the exploit code.
But even after the exploit was released, widespread patching
didn’t occur until mid-May, after the WannaCry attack made
headlines around the world. Figure 37 shows the steep
remediation curve after that campaign. By late May, few
devices were left unpatched.
Qualys’ research into its customers’ patching behavior
indicates that it takes a major event to motivate many
organizations to patch critical vulnerabilites—even knowledge
of an active exploit is not enough to accelerate remediation.
And in the case of the WannaCry campaign, businesses had
access to the patch for the Microsoft vulnerability for two
months before the ransomware attacks occurred.
Another factor, as described by researchers with Cisco and
Qualys partner Lumeta, was that unknown, unmanaged,
rogue, and shadow IT endpoints were left unpatched.
Attackers were able to leverage these blind spots. Without
knowledge of these systems, vulnerabilty scanners were
unable to evaluate and recommend patching of these
systems, leaving them vulnerable to WannaCry.

Patching is even slower, or not happening at all,
for IoT devices
Qualys also examined patching trends for IoT devices. The
devices in the sample included IP-enabled HVAC systems,
door locks, fire alarm panels, and card readers.
The researchers looked specifically for IoT devices
vulnerable to several known threats, including Devil’s Ivy
malware that exploits a vulnerability in a piece of code called
gSOAP that is widely used in physical security products,
and Mirai, an IoT botnet that connects to targeted machines
through brute-force attacks against Telnet servers.

Vulnerable Hosts

Qualys detected 7328 devices in total, but only 1206 had
been fixed (see Figure 38). That means 83 percent of the
IoT devices in the sample still have critical vulnerabilities.
While Qualys did not find evidence of threat actors actively
targeting those vulnerabilities, organizations were still
susceptible to attack. However, they do not seem motivated
to speed remediation.
There are several possible explanations for the patching
inertia, according to Qualys. Some devices may not be
updatable, for example. Others may require direct support
from the vendor. Also, it is not always clear who inside
the organization is responsible for maintenance of IoT
devices. For example, an engineering team that takes care of
the company’s HVAC system may not be aware of IT risks
that could affect that system, or even that the system
is IP-enabled.
More concerning, though, is the low number of IoT devices that
Qualys detected. The actual number is likely to be much higher
because organizations simply do not know how many IoT
devices are connected to their network. That lack of visibility
puts them at serious risk of compromise (see page 34 for more
on this topic).

A first step to addressing this issue is inventorying all IoT
devices on the network. Organizations can then determine
whether the devices are scannable and still supported by
vendors, and which employees in the company own and use
them. Organizations can also improve IoT security by treating
all IoT devices like other computing devices—helping to ensure
they receive firmware updates and are patched regularly.

Most common vulnerabilities are low severity but high risk
Low-severity vulnerabilities are often left unremediated for
years because companies either don’t know they exist or
don’t consider them significant risks, according to security
experts with SAINT Corporation, a security solutions company
and Cisco partner. However, these small but significant security
gaps could provide adversaries with pathways into systems.

SAINT researchers examined vulnerability exposure data
collected from more than 10,000 hosts in 2016 and 2017.
The company developed a list of the top vulnerabilities
detected most often across all the organizations in the study,
which indicated that low-severity vulnerabilities occur most
often (see Figure 39). (Note: Some organizations included in
the research had more than one host.)

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The attack landscape

Here’s a closer look at the top three low-severity vulnerabilities
in Figure 39 and why they might be valuable to threat actors:
TCP timestamp requests enabled
TCP timestamps offer information about how long a machine
has been running, or when it was last rebooted, which could
help adversaries learn what types of patchable vulnerabilities
the machine might have to exploit. Also, software programs
may use the system timestamp to seed a random number
generator for creating encryption keys.
TCP reset by approximate sequence number
Remote attackers can guess sequence numbers and cause a
denial of service to persistent TCP connections by repeatedly
injecting a TCP RST packet, especially in protocols that use
long-lived connections, such as the Border Gateway Protocol.
“BEAST” attack
An attacker can use the Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS
(BEAST) vulnerability to launch a man-in-the-middle (MiTM)
attack to essentially “read” protected content being exchanged
between parties. (Note: This is a complicated attack to execute,
as the threat actor also must have control of the client-side
browser to read and inject data packets very quickly.)

44

Security researchers with SAINT did not detect adversaries
actively exploiting these low-severity vulnerabilities during
their analysis.
The vulnerabilities shown in Figure 39 are known to the security
community, but some of them would not typically be flagged
or lead to automatic failure during a routine compliance check,
such as a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI
DSS) audit. They are not critical vulnerabilities as defined by
standards relevant to that industry. Each industry triages the
criticality of vulnerabilities differently.
Also, most of the commonly occurring vulnerabilities that are
low-severity shown in Figure 39 cannot be remediated easily,
or at all, through patch management because they stem
from configuration problems or security certificate issues (for
example, weak SSL ciphers or a self-signed SSL certificate).
Organizations should act promptly to address low-severity
vulnerabilities that may present risk. They should evaluate and
identify remediation priorities based on how they perceive
the risk, rather than rely on third-party ratings, or partial use
of a scoring system, such as a CVSS base score, or a certain
compliance rating. Only the organizations know their unique
environments and their risk management strategies.

Part II:

The defender landscape

Part II: The defender landscape
We know that attackers are evolving and adapting their techniques at a faster pace
than defenders. They are also weaponizing and field testing their exploits, evasion
strategies, and skills so they can launch attacks of increasing magnitude. When
adversaries inevitably strike their organizations, will defenders be prepared, and
how quickly can they recover? That depends largely on the steps they’re taking
today to strengthen their security posture.
What we’ve learned through our research for the Cisco 2018
Security Capabilities Benchmark Study is that defenders have
a lot of work to do—and challenges to overcome. To gauge
the perceptions of defenders on the state of security in their
organizations, we asked chief information security officers
(CISOs) and security operations (SecOps) managers in
several countries and at organizations of various sizes about
their security resources and procedures.
The Cisco 2018 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study
offers insights on security practices currently in use, and
compares these results with those of the 2017, 2016,
and 2015 studies. The research involved more than 3600
respondents across 26 countries.

The cost of attacks
The fear of breaches is founded in the financial cost of
attacks, which is no longer a hypothetical number. Breaches
cause real economic damage to organizations, damage that
can take months or years to resolve. According to study
respondents, more than half (53 percent) of all attacks
resulted in financial damages of more than US$500,000,
including, but not limited to, lost revenue, customers,
opportunities, and out-of-pocket costs (Figure 40).

Challenges and obstacles
In their efforts to protect their organizations, security teams
face many roadblocks. Organizations must defend several
areas and functions, which adds to security challenges.

The most challenging areas and functions to defend are
mobile devices, data in the public cloud, and user behavior
(Figure 41).

Security professionals cite budget, interoperability, and
personnel as their key constraints when managing security
(Figure 42). The lack of trained personnel is also named as
a challenge to adopting advanced security processes and
technology. In 2017, 27 percent cited the lack of talent as an
obstacle, compared with 25 percent in 2016 and 22 percent
in 2015.

Lack of skilled talent tops the list of obstacles in all industries
and across all regions. “If I could wave a magic wand and
get 10 percent more people to take some of the burden off
people who really feel the heat because of high demand for
their particular service areas, I would be a very, very happy
guy,” said a CISO for a large professional services firm.
While the skilled talent gap is an ongoing challenge,
organizations report that they’re seeking out and hiring more
resources for their security teams. In 2017, the median
number of security professionals at organizations was 40, a
significant increase from 2016’s median number of 33
(Figure 43).

Complexity created by vendors in orchestration
Defenders are implementing a complex mix of products from
a cross-section of vendors: an arsenal of tools that may
obfuscate rather than clarify the security landscape. This
complexity has many downstream effects on an organization’s
ability to defend against attacks, such as increased risk
of losses.

In 2017, 25 percent of security professionals said they used
products from 11 to 20 vendors, compared with 18 percent
of security professionals in 2016. Also in 2017, 16 percent
said they use anywhere from 21 to 50 vendors, compared to
7 percent of respondents in 2016 (Figure 44).

The value of an integrated framework
Why use a multitude of products from many vendors if the
resulting environment is difficult to manage? The best-ofbreed approach, in which security teams choose the best
solution for each security need, is one key reason. Security
professionals who practice the best-of-breed approach also
believe it’s more cost-effective, according to research for the
benchmark study.
When comparing best-of-breed to integrated solutions,
72 percent of security professionals said they buy best-ofbreed point solutions to meet specific needs, compared with
28 percent who buy products intended to work together as
an integrated solution (see Figure 52). Of the organizations
that adopt a best-of-breed approach, 57 percent cite

cost-effectiveness, while 39 percent said the best-of-breed
approach is easier to implement.
Interestingly, organizations that adopt an integrated approach
to security cite similar reasons for their choice. Fifty-six
percent said an integrated approach is more cost-effective.
Forty-seven percent said it’s easier to implement.
Ease of implementation is increasingly cited as a factor for
using an integrated architecture approach: Only 33 percent
of organizations said ease of implementation was a reason
to choose an integrated approach in 2016, compared to 47
percent in 2017. While single-vendor solutions may not be
practical for all organizations, buyers of security solutions
must help ensure that solutions work together to reduce risk
and increase efficacy.

Services: Addressing people and policies, as well as technology
Faced with potential losses and adverse impact on
systems, organizations need to move beyond relying solely
on technology for defense. That means examining other
opportunities to improve security, such as applying policies or
training users. This holistic approach to security can be seen
in the issues identified during an Intelligence Lead Security
Assurance (known as a “Red Team” assessment) provided by
the Cisco Advanced Services Security Advisory team.
In examining recommendation data from several Red Team
assessments carried out in 2017, services team members
identified three key defensive capabilities: people, policies, and
technology. If an organization were to use technology alone
to remediate security vulnerabilities, it would only solve 26
percent of issues that were identified during Red Team attack
simulations. That would leave 74 percent of issues unresolved
(see Figure 53). Likewise, if organizations use only policies to
address security issues, they would resolve just 10 percent of
issues; with user training for people, only 4 percent of issues.
The three areas of defense need to be tackled in concert.

Figure 54 offers examples of issues identified by category
during the simulations. Some issues, such as weak
passwords, cross over all three categories. Strengthening
passwords can require improvements in people (user training),
products (configuring servers for more complex passwords),
and policies (setting stronger password requirements).

Organizations can increase their odds of successfully
managing all three factors if they help ensure that security
is embedded into every layer of the organization—not bolted
on here and there. They should also avoid relying solely
on products or technical improvements to fix security. For
products to be successful, organizations need to understand
and implement sensible policies and processes for
the technology.

Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report | The defender landscape

Expectations: Investing in technology and training
Security professionals fully anticipate that the threats facing
their organizations will remain complex and challenging.
They expect bad actors to develop more sophisticated and
damaging ways to breach networks. They also know that
the modern workplace creates conditions that favor the
attackers: The mobility of employees and adoption of IoT
devices provide attackers with fresh opportunities. Along with
increased threats, many security professionals expect they’ll
be under additional scrutiny—from regulators, executives,
stakeholders, partners, and clients.
To reduce the likelihood of risk and losses, defenders must
determine where to invest finite resources. For the most
part, security professionals said that security budgets remain
relatively stable, unless a major public breach drives a rethink
of, and new expenditures for, technology and processes.
Fifty-one percent said security spending is based on previous
years’ budgets, while an equal percentage of respondents
said outcome objectives drive budget (Figure 55). Most
security leaders said they believe their companies are
spending appropriately on security.

When planning budgets, many companies systematically
work through wish lists developed as part of comprehensive
security plans, prioritizing investments as resources become
available. Investments may be reset if new vulnerabilities are
exposed, whether by an internal incident, a highly publicized
public breach, or a routine third-party risk assessment.
The most important factors driving future investment, and
therefore improvements in technology and processes,
appear to be breaches. In 2017, 41 percent of security
professionals said that security breaches are driving increased
investment in security technologies and solutions, up from 37
percent in 2016 (Figure 56). Forty percent said breaches are
driving increased investment in the training of security staff,
compared with 37 percent in 2016.

Security professionals expect to spend more on tools that use
artificial intelligence and machine learning in a bid to improve
defenses and help shoulder the workload. In addition, they
plan to invest in tools that will provide safeguards for critical
systems, such as critical infrastructure services.

To stretch resources and strengthen defenses, organizations
are stepping up their reliance on outsourcing. Among security
professionals, 49 percent said they outsourced monitoring
services in 2017, compared with 44 percent in 2015; 47
percent outsourced incident response in 2017, compared
with 42 percent in 2015 (Figure 57).

One reason defenders struggle to rise above the chaos of
evading detection. They have more effective tools, like
war with attackers, and truly see and understand what’s
encryption, and more advanced and clever tactics, such as
happening in the threat landscape, is the sheer volume of
the abuse of legitimate Internet services, to conceal their
potentially malicious traffic they face. Our research shows

Our security products also saw an elevenfold increase in overall
malware volume during that same period, as Figure 59 shows.
Trends in malware volume have an impact on defenders’
time to detection (TTD), which is an important metric for any
organization to understand how well its security defenses
are performing under pressure from the constant barrage of
malware deployed by adversaries.
The Cisco median TTD of about 4.6 hours for the period
from November 2016 to October 2017 helps to illustrate the
ongoing challenge of identifying threats quickly in the chaotic
threat landscape. Still, that figure is well below the 39-hour
median TTD we reported in November 2015, after we first

began tracking TTD, and the 14-hour median reported in the
Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report for the period from
November 2015 to October 2016.20
The use of cloud-based security technology has been a key
factor in helping Cisco to drive and keep its median TTD at a
low level. The cloud helps to scale and maintain performance
as both the volume of total events and malware targeting
endpoints continues to increase. On-premises security
solutions would struggle to offer the same flexibility. Designing
one to scale that could handle more than 10 times the volume
capacity of malicious events over a two-year period—and
maintain or increase response times—would be a very difficult
and costly undertaking for any organization.

Cisco defines “time to detection,” or TTD, as the window of time between a compromise and the identification of
a threat. We determine this time window using opt-in security telemetry gathered from Cisco security products
deployed around the globe. Using our global visibility and a continuous analytics model, we are able to measure
from the moment a malicious file is downloaded on an endpoint to the time it is determined to be a threat that was
unclassified at the time of encounter.
“Median TTD” is the average of the monthly medians for the period observed.
