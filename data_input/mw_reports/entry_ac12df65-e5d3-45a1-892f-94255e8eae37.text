Introduction
Machete is an info-stealing malware that can harvest user credentials, chat logs, screenshots,
webcam pictures, geolocation, and perform keylogging. It can also copy files to a USB device and
take control of the clipboard to exfiltrate information.
Machete is typically distributed via social engineering techniques and malicious websites. The user
is enticed into opening the original executable under the premise that they are opening a
PowerPoint presentation. This is in fact a Nullsoft installer SFX.
The Powerpoint can range from illicit images to cleverly crafted images that are meant to represent
government/ military documentation. The most common names being: "Hermosa xxx,pps,rar",
"Suntzu.rar", and "Hot brazilian XXX.rar". Based on language found within the file along with open
source information the intended targets appear to be Spanish speaking nations across Latin
America. The payload is typically packaged as part of a PowerPoint presentation with Nullsoft
installer SFX. The executables within the SFX are compiled using Python.

Technical Analysis
Static Analysis Pre/Post SFX Extraction
The original executable is disguised as a document; however, it is an SFX Nullsoft installation file:

Once extracted, the following folders are opened in the working directory, which also contains
NullSoft SFX files:

Figure 2: Phase 2 of SFX

Figure 3: Phase 3 of SFX
The fourth extraction creates a folder containing a PowerPoint presentation file and another SFX
file disguised as a Java executable:

Figure 4: Phase 4 of extraction, revealing two files
The JavaAlq.exe file contains a multitude of java executables along with a series of Python
libraries:

Figure 5: JavaAlq.exe post-extraction
Each of the Java executables contained within the original JavaAlq.exe is compiled with a Python
script. Each one contains a large volume of Python libraries necessary for the executable to be
compiled and run. These Java executables all contain a payload component:

The raw script can be extracted from the executables using a Py2Exe Binary Editor:

Figure 7: Java.exe PythonScript being dumped
Once this Python script has been dumped it needs to be converted into a Python file using an
open source Python script extractor:

Figure 8: PythonScript extractor
The final step involved in producing the malicious script is to decompile the Python script. This is
done with Easy Python Decompiler:

Malicious Payloads
Java.exe
The keylogging functionality contained within the payload of Java.exe is shown in Figure 10. The
standard ascii keys are listed with their key IDs. The hook for the keyboard is also set within this
script:

Evidence of connection to the remote server contained within java.exe is shown in Figure 12:

Document Type Check JavaUE.exe
Contained within the payload of JavaUE.exe is a document type check of a target directory:

JavaK.exe Payload Script
Figure 14 illustrates the webcam information being sent to a remote server. Interestingly, it sets the
resolution at which to capture information to a low resolution in order to expedite exfiltration of
images:

JavaTM.exe Payload Script
JavaS.exe is run as the last process. It terminates the rest of the spawned processes then deletes
them from the victim machine:

Dynamic Analysis

3/6

When the script is executed, a series of files are created along with the Java labelled executables.
A crypo.cipher.AES Python file is dropped which is used to encrypt the exfiltrated data sent to the
FTP server. It is also used to assign an encrypted unique identifier to each victim machine. The
other files installed are Python libraries necessary for the executable to run its payload. The
system information text file is created to record data from the victim machine.

Conclusion
Blackberry Cylance uses artificial intelligence-based agents trained for threat detection on millions
of both safe and unsafe files. Our automated security agents block Machete based on countless
file attributes and malicious behaviors instead of relying on a specific file signature.
Blackberry Cylance, which offers a predictive advantage over zero-day threats, is trained on and
effective against both new and legacy cyberattacks. If you are a Blackberry Cylance customer
using CylancePROTECTÂ®, you are protected from Machete by our machine learning models.
