Beijing may have had a hand in attacks in Ukraine, too

China has been accused of conducting a long-term cyber attack on India's power grid, and
has been implicated in cyber attacks against targets in Ukraine.
Cybersecurity firm Insikt Group found network intrusions at seven Indian State Load
Dispatch Centers (SLDCs) that conduct real-time operations for grid control and electricity
dispatch, according to a report released Wednesday. All seven SLDCs were located near the
disputed India-China border in Ladakh.

Although one of the SLDCs had been previously targeted – in a 2020 incident that Insikt
Group named RedEcho and credited to Beijing – the newly identified intrusions target an
almost entirely different set of victims.
Insikt stated that in addition to attacking grid assets, the operation impacted a national
emergency response team and the Indian subsidiary of a logistics company.
The operation used a trojan called ShadowPad, thought to have links to contractors serving
China's Ministry of State Security (MSS).
The attackers, sometimes identified a Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38), are believed to
have infiltrated the system via third-party devices like IP cameras that may have been left
vulnerable when their default credentials were kept in place.
"The group likely compromised and co-opted internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for
command and control (C2) of ShadowPad malware infections, as well as use of the open
source tool FastReverseProxy (FRP)," opined Insikt Group in its report.
The cybersecurity group said that because the targeting was prolonged, it was most likely a
mission to gather information about critical infrastructure, rather than seeking immediateterm benefit. Such information could later be used to gain access across a system to take
(presumably disruptive) action.
Beijing, predictably, denied involvement. Foreign spokesperson Zhao Lijian asserted that
China firmly opposed all forms of cyber attacks, in accordance with the law. He added that
one should be "all the more prudent when associating cyber attacks with the government of a
certain country."
The past few weeks have also brought a string of reported attacks emanating from China
against targets in Ukraine.
SentinelLabs concluded in late March that malware sent throughout the country disguised as
a call to send in video documentation of Russian aggression was associated with the
suspected Chinese threat actor known as Scarab.
"The malicious activity represents one of the first public examples of a Chinese threat actor
targeting Ukraine since the invasion began," said SentinelOne's Tom Hegel.
American enterprise security company Proofpoint also identified ongoing threat activity from
China last month. Researchers said TA416 is targeting European diplomatic entities,
including an individual involved in refugee and migrant services.
Proofpoint said the activity showed "an interest in refugee policies and logistics across the
APT actor landscape which coincides with increased tensions and now armed conflict
between Russia and Ukraine."

But according to the anonymous collective Intrusion Truth – a group that analyses Chinalinked cyber attacks – state-sponsored threat actor FunnyDream had also targeted the
Kremlin, Russian private bank Alfabank, and the Federal Guard Service of the Russian
Federation.
"Wonder what that says about China's trust in Russia?" mused Intrusion Truth. ®

Stolen university credentials up for sale by Russian crooks, FBI warns
Forget dark-web souks, thousands of these are already being traded on public bazaars
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 22:34 UTC
Russian crooks are selling network credentials and virtual private network access for a
"multitude" of US universities and colleges on criminal marketplaces, according to the
FBI.
According to a warning issued on Thursday, these stolen credentials sell for thousands
of dollars on both dark web and public internet forums, and could lead to subsequent
cyberattacks against individual employees or the schools themselves.
"The exposure of usernames and passwords can lead to brute force credential stuffing
computer network attacks, whereby attackers attempt logins across various internet
sites or exploit them for subsequent cyber attacks as criminal actors take advantage of
users recycling the same credentials across multiple accounts, internet sites, and
services," the Feds' alert [PDF] said.

Big Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation
Study claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules
Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC
Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public
statements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common
organizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.
That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the
corporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown
state privacy bills.
The report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy
legislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,
Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the
State Privacy and Security Coalition.

SEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake
Meanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors
Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC 1
America's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed
his purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media
company hangs in the balance.
A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he "[did] not appear"
to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter "required 10 days
from the date of acquisition," and asked him to provide more information. Musk's
shares made him one of Twitter's largest shareholders. The letter is dated April 4, and
was shared this week by the regulator.
Musk quickly moved to try and buy the whole company outright in a deal initially worth
over $44 billion. Musk sold a chunk of his shares in Tesla worth $8.4 billion and bagged
another $7.14 billion from investors to help finance the $21 billion he promised to put
forward for the deal. The remaining $25.5 billion bill was secured via debt financing by
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, and others. But the takeover is not going
smoothly.

Cloud security unicorn cuts 20% of staff after raising $1.3b
Time to play blame bingo: Markets? Profits? Too much growth? Russia? Space aliens?
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 19:19 UTC 5
Cloud security company Lacework has laid off 20 percent of its employees, just months
after two record-breaking funding rounds pushed its valuation to $8.3 billion.
A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the total number of employees affected, though told
The Register that the "widely speculated number on Twitter is a significant
overestimate."
The company, as of March, counted more than 1,000 employees, which would push
the jobs lost above 200. And the widely reported number on Twitter is about 300
employees. The biz, based in Silicon Valley, was founded in 2015.

Talos names eight deadly sins in widely used industrial software
Entire swaths of gear relies on vulnerability-laden Open Automation Software (OAS)
Jeff Burt Fri 27 May 2022 // 18:30 UTC
A researcher at Cisco's Talos threat intelligence team found eight vulnerabilities in the
Open Automation Software (OAS) platform that, if exploited, could enable a bad actor
to access a device and run code on a targeted system.
The OAS platform is widely used by a range of industrial enterprises, essentially
facilitating the transfer of data within an IT environment between hardware and
software and playing a central role in organizations' industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
efforts. It touches a range of devices, including PLCs and OPCs and IoT devices, as
well as custom applications and APIs, databases and edge systems.
Companies like Volvo, General Dynamics, JBT Aerotech and wind-turbine maker AES
are among the users of the OAS platform.

Despite global uncertainty, $500m hit doesn't rattle Nvidia execs
CEO acknowledges impact of war, pandemic but says fundamentals ‘are really good’
Dylan Martin Fri 27 May 2022 // 16:08 UTC 1
Nvidia is expecting a $500 million hit to its global datacenter and consumer business in
the second quarter due to COVID lockdowns in China and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Despite those and other macroeconomic concerns, executives are still
optimistic about future prospects.
"The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is
difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities
remain unchanged," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO and co-founder, during the
company's first-quarter earnings call.
Those two statements might sound a little contradictory, including to some investors,
particularly following the stock selloff yesterday after concerns over Russia and China
prompted Nvidia to issue lower-than-expected guidance for second-quarter revenue.

Another AI supercomputer from HPE: Champollion lands in France
That's the second in a week following similar system in Munich also aimed at
researchers
Dan Robinson Fri 27 May 2022 // 15:30 UTC
HPE is lifting the lid on a new AI supercomputer – the second this week – aimed at
building and training larger machine learning models to underpin research.
Based at HPE's Center of Excellence in Grenoble, France, the new supercomputer is
to be named Champollion after the French scholar who made advances in deciphering
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 19th century. It was built in partnership with Nvidia using
AMD-based Apollo computer nodes fitted with Nvidia's A100 GPUs.
Champollion brings together HPC and purpose-built AI technologies to train machine
learning models at scale and unlock results faster, HPE said. HPE already provides
HPC and AI resources from its Grenoble facilities for customers, and the broader
research community to access, and said it plans to provide access to Champollion for
scientists and engineers globally to accelerate testing of their AI models and research.

UK monopoly watchdog investigates Google's online advertising business
Another probe? Mountain View is starting to look like a pincushion at this rate
Richard Currie Fri 27 May 2022 // 14:00 UTC 3
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority is lining up yet another investigation into
Google over its dominance of the digital advertising market.
This latest inquiry, announced Thursday, is the second major UK antitrust investigation
into Google this year alone. In March this year the UK, together with the European
Union, said it wished to examine Google's "Jedi Blue" agreement with Meta to allegedly
favor the former's Open Bidding ads platform.
The news also follows proposals last week by a bipartisan group of US lawmakers to
create legislation that could force Alphabet's Google, Meta's Facebook, and Amazon to
divest portions of their ad businesses.

Microsoft slows some hiring for Windows, Teams, and Office
'Making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity' ahead of next
fiscal year
Richard Speed Fri 27 May 2022 // 13:31 UTC 4
Microsoft has hit the brakes on hiring in some key product areas as the company
prepares for the next fiscal year and all that might bring.
According to reports in the Bloomberg, the unit that develops Windows, Office, and
Teams is affected and while headcount remains expected to grow, new hires in that
division must first be approved by bosses.
During a talk this week at JP Morgan's Technology, Media and Communications
Conference, Rajesh Jha, executive VP for the Office Product Group, noted that within
three years he expected approximately two-thirds of CIOs to standardize on Microsoft
Teams. 1.4 billion PCs were running Windows. He also remarked: "We have lots of
room here to grow the seats with Office 365."
