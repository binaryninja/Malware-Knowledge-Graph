With a wink and a smile, the new Avaddon Ransomware has come alive in a massive spam
campaign targeting users worldwide.
Avaddon was launched at the beginning of this month and is actively recruiting hackers and
malware distributors to spread the ransomware by any means possible.
As its first known attack, the Avaddon Ransomware is being distributed in a spam campaign
reminiscent of February's Nemty Ransomware Love Letter campaign.

You like my photo?
In a wave of emails using subjects like "Your new photo?" or "Do you like my photo?"
containing nothing but a winking smiley face, a JavaScript downloader for the Avaddon
ransomware is being distributed.

Example Avaddon spam email
In a related report shared with BleepingComputer, the cybersecurity firm Appriver stated
that the Phorphiex/Trik Botnet is distributing the malicious emails.
This campaign is not small, as AppRiver security researcher David Picket told us that they
had blocked over 300,000 emails in just a short period.
Attached to these emails is a JavaScript file masquerading as a JPG photo with names like
IMG123101.jpg.
Before you ask why someone would open a JavaScript file that was emailed to them, it is
important to remember that Windows hides file extension by default, even though it is a
known security risk.
That means to the recipient, it would just appear as a .jpg file, as shown below.

When executed, the JS attachment will launch both a PowerShell and Bitsadmin
command to download the Avaddon ransomware executable to the %Temp% folder and run
it.

In the sample tested by BleepingComputer, once executed, the ransomware will search for
data to encrypt and append the .avdn extension to encrypted files.

Files encrypted by Avaddon
In each folder, a ransom note named [id]-readme.html will also be created. This ransom
note contains a link to the TOR payment site and a unique victim ID used to login to the
site.

This TOR payment site includes the ransom amount, which in our cause was $900, and
instructions on how to pay for a decryptor.

Other sections of the TOR site include a support chat, free test decryption, and a help page
illustrated by Harry Potter characters.

Unfortunately, ID-Ransomware creator Michael Gillespie has analyzed the ransomware and
stated that it is secure and cannot be decrypted for free.

More to come
In advertisements posted to Russian-speaking hacker forums at the beginning of the month,
Avaddon has stated that they are a new Ransomware-as-an-Affiliate (RaaS) program.

A RaaS program is when the ransomware creator is responsible for the development of the
malware and the operation of the TOR payment site.
Affiliates who join the program are responsible for distributing the ransomware via spam,
compromising networks, and exploit kits.
As part of this arrangement, Avaddon is paying affiliates 65% of any ransom payments they
bring in, and the Avaddon operators will receive 35%. Larger affiliates are commonly able to
negotiate a higher revenue share depending on the size of their attacks.
As is typical with RaaS programs, Avaddon has a series of rules that affiliates must follow
when distributing the ransomware. The most common rule is that they cannot target victims
in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
It is forbidden to work in the CIS countries (AZ, AM, BY, KZ, KG, MD, RU, TJ, UZ, UA, GE ,
TM)
It is forbidden to indicate or pass on to third parties the address of the admin panel on the

.onion network.
It is forbidden to upload .exe to unverified scanners that merge AV labs.

Now that the Avaddon creators have started accepting applications, we should expect to
see distribution increase and more advanced attacks to occur.
