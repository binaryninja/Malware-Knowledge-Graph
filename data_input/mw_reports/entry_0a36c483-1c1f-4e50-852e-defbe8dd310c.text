Solving some of the mysteries of Snake/Uroburos

1/29

Technical Appendix with IOCs

Executive Summary
Over the last 10 months, Kaspersky Lab researchers have analyzed a massive cyberespionage operation which we call “Epic Turla”. The attackers behind Epic Turla have
infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries, including government
institutions, embassies, military, education, research and pharmaceutical companies.
The attacks are known to have used at least two zero-day exploits:
CVE-2013-5065 – Privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows XP and Windows 2003
CVE-2013-3346 – Arbitrary code-execution vulnerability in Adobe Reader
We also observed exploits against older (patched) vulnerabilities, social engineering
techniques and watering hole strategies in these attacks. The primary backdoor used in the
Epic attacks is also known as “WorldCupSec”, “TadjMakhal”, “Wipbot” or “Tavdig”.
When G-Data published on Turla/Uroburos back in February, several questions remained
unanswered. One big unknown was the infection vector for Turla (aka Snake or Uroburos).
Our analysis indicates that victims are infected via a sophisticated multi-stage attack, which
begins with the Epic Turla. In time, as the attackers gain confidence, this is upgraded to more
2/29

sophisticated backdoors, such as the Carbon/Cobra system. Sometimes, both backdoors are
run in tandem, and used to “rescue” each other if communications are lost with one of the
backdoors.
Once the attackers obtain the necessary credentials without the victim noticing, they deploy
the rootkit and other extreme persistence mechanisms.
The attacks are still ongoing as of July 2014, actively targeting users in Europe and the
Middle East.
Note: A full analysis of the Epic attacks is available to the Kaspersky Intelligent
Services subscribers. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com

The Epic Turla attacks
The attacks in this campaign fall into several different categories depending on the vector
used in the initial compromise:
Spearphishing e-mails with Adobe PDF exploits (CVE-2013-3346 + CVE-2013-5065)
Social engineering to trick the user into running malware installers with “.SCR”
extension, sometimes packed with RAR
Watering hole attacks using Java exploits (CVE-2012-1723), Flash exploits (unknown)
or Internet Explorer 6,7,8 exploits (unknown)
Watering hole attacks that rely on social engineering to trick the user into running fake
“Flash Player” malware installers
The attackers use both direct spearphishing and watering hole attacks to infect their victims.
Watering holes (waterholes) are websites of interest to the victims that have been
compromised by the attackers and injected to serve malicious code.
So far we haven’t been able to locate any e-mail used against the victims, only the
attachments. The PDF attachments do not show any “lure” to the victim when opened,
however, the SCR packages sometime show a clean PDF upon successful installation.

3/29

Some of known attachment names used in the spearphishing attacks are:
‫ؤﺗﻤﺮ ﺟﻨﯿﻒ‬.rar (translation from Arabic: “Geneva conference.rar”)
NATO position on Syria.scr
Note_№107-41D.pdf
Talking Points.scr
border_security_protocol.rar
Security protocol.scr
Program.scr
In some cases, these filenames can provide clues about the type of victims the attackers are
targeting.

The watering hole attacks
Currently, the Epic attackers run a vast network of watering holes that target visitors with
surgical precision.
Some of the injected websites include:

4/29

The website of the City Hall of Pinor, Spain

A site promoting entrepreneurship in the border area of Romania

5/29

Palestinian Authority Ministry of Foreign Affairs
In total, we observed more than 100 injected websites. Currently, the largest number of
injected sites is in Romania.
Here’s a statistic on the injected websites:

6/29

The distribution is obviously not random, and it reflects some of the interests of the attackers.
For instance, in Romania many of the infected sites are in the Mures region, while many of
the Spanish infected sites belong to local governments (City Hall).
Most of the infected sites use the TYPO3 CMS (see: https://typo3.org/), which could indicate
the attackers are abusing a specific vulnerability in this publishing platform.
Injected websites load a remote JavaScript into the victim’s browser:

7/29

The script “sitenavigatoin.js” is a Pinlady-style browser and plugin detection script, which in
turn, redirects to a PHP script sometimes called main.php or wreq.php. Sometimes, the
attackers register the .JPG extension with the PHP handler on the server, using “JPG” files to
run PHP scripts:

Profiling script
The main exploitation script “wreq.php”, “main.php” or “main.jpg” performs a numbers of
tasks. We have located several versions of this script which attempt various exploitation
mechanisms.
One version of this script attempts to exploit Internet Explorer versions 6, 7 and 8:

8/29

Internet Explorer exploitation script
Unfortunately, the Internet Explorer exploits have not yet been retrieved.
Another more recent version attempts to exploit Oracle Sun Java and Adobe Flash Player:

Java and Flash Player exploitation scripts
Although the Flash Player exploits couldn’t be retrieved, we did manage to obtain the Java
exploits:

The Java files exploit a popular vulnerability, CVE-2012-1723, in various configurations.
The payload dropped by these Java exploits is the following:
MD5: d7ca9cf72753df7392bfeea834bcf992
The Java exploit use a special loader that attempts to inject the final Epic backdoor payload
into explorer.exe. The backdoor extracted from the Java exploits has the following C&C
hardcoded inside:
www.arshinmalalan[.]com/themes/v6/templates/css/in.php
This C&C is still online at the moment although it redirects to a currently suspended page at
“hxxp://busandcoachdirectory.com[.]au“. For a full list of C&C servers, please see the
Appendix.
The Epic Turla attackers are extremely dynamic in using exploits or different methods
depending on what is available at the moment. Most recently, we observed them using yet
another technique coupled with watering hole attacks. This takes advantage of social
engineering to trick the user into running a fake Flash Player (MD5:
030f5fdb78bfc1ce7b459d3cc2cf1877):

10/29

In at least one case, they tried to trick the user into downloading and running a fake Microsoft
Security Essentials app (MD5: 89b0f1a3a667e5cd43f5670e12dba411):

The fake application is signed by a valid digital certificate from Sysprint AG:
Serial number: 00 c0 a3 9e 33 ec 8b ea 47 72 de 4b dc b7 49 bb 95
Thumbprint: 24 21 58 64 f1 28 97 2b 26 22 17 2d ee 62 82 46 07 99 ca 46

This file was distributed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan’s website, at
“hxxp://mfa[.]tj/upload/security.php“.
The file is a .NET application that contains an encrypted resource. This drops the malicious
file with the MD5 7731d42b043865559258464fe1c98513.
This is an Epic backdoor which connects to the following C&Cs, with a generic internal ID of
1156fd22-3443-4344-c4ffff:
hxxp://homaxcompany[.]com/components/com_sitemap/
hxxp://www.hadilotfi[.]com/wp-content/themes/profile/
A full list with all the C&C server URLs that we recovered from the samples can be found in
the technical Appendix.

The Epic command-and-control infrastructure
The Epic backdoors are commanded by a huge network of hacked servers that deliver
command and control functionality.
The huge network commanded by the Epic Turla attackers serves multiple purposes. For
instance, the motherships function as both exploitation sites and command and control
panels for the malware.
Here’s how the big picture looks like:

12/29

Epic Turla lifecycle
The first level of command and control proxies generally talk to a second level of proxies,
which in turn, talk to the “mothership” server. The mothership server is generally a VPS,
which runs the Control panel software used to interact with the victims. The attackers
operate the mothership using a network of proxies and VPN servers for anonymity reasons.
The mothership also work as the exploitation servers used in the watering hole attacks,
delivering Java, IE or fake applications to the victim.
We were able to get a copy of one of the motherships, which provided some insight into the
operation.
13/29

It runs a control panel which is password protected:

Epic mothership control panel login
Once logged into the Control panel, the attackers can see a general overview of the system
including the number of interesting potential targets:

Epic control panel status overview
A very interesting file on the servers is task.css, where the attackers define the IP ranges
they are interested in. To change the file, they are using the “Task editor” from the menu.
Depending on the “tasks”, they will decide whether to infect the visitors or not. In this case,
we found they targeted two ranges belonging to:
“Country A” – Federal Government Network
“Country B” – Government Telecommunications and Informatics Services Network

14/29

It should be noted though, the fact that the attackers were targeting these ranges doesn’t
necessarily mean they also got infected. Some other unknown IPs were also observed in the
targeting schedules.
There is also an “except.css” file where attackers log the reasons they didn’t try to exploit
certain visitors. There are three possible values:
TRY
DON’T TRY -> Version of the browser and OS does not meet the conditions
DON’T TRY -> (2012-09-19 10:02:04) – checktime < 60
These are the “don’t meet the conditions” reasons observed in the logs:
Windows 7 or 2008 R2
MSIE 8.0
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2;
.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322;
.NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)
Adobe Shockwave 11.5.1.601
Adobe Flash 10.3.181.14
Adobe Reader 10.1.0.0
Win Media Player 12.0.7601.17514
Quick Time null
MS Word null
Java null

The Epic / Tavdig / Wipbot backdoor
For this first stage of the attack, the threat actor uses a custom backdoor. In some cases, the
backdoor is packaged together with the CVE-2013-5065 EoP exploit and heavily obfuscated.
This makes the analysis more difficult.
The CVE-2013-5065 exploit allows the backdoor to achieve administrator privileges on the
system and run unrestricted. This exploit only works on unpatched Microsoft Windows XP
systems.
Other known detection names for the backdoor is Trojan.Wipbot (Symantec) or Tavdig.
The main backdoor is about 60KB in size and implements a C&C protocol on top of normal
HTTP requests. The communication protocol uses
requests in the C&C
replies, which the malware decrypts and processes. The replies are sent back to the C&C
through the same channel.

15/29

The malware behavior is defined by a configuration block. The configuration block usually
contains two hard-coded C&C URLs. He have also seen one case where the configuration
block contains just one URL. The configuration can also be updated on the fly by the
attackers, via the C&C.
The backdoor attempts to identify the following processes and, if found, it will terminate itself:
tcpdump.exe
windump.exe
ethereal.exe
wireshark.exe
ettercap.exe
snoop.exe
dsniff.exe
It contains an internal unique ID, which is used to identify the victim to the C&C. Most
samples, especially old ones, have the ID 1156fd22-3443-4344-c4ffff. Once a victim is
confirmed as “interesting”, the attackers upload another Epic backdoor which has a unique
ID used to control this specific victim.
During the first C&C call, the backdoor sends a pack with the victim’s system information. All
further information sent to the C&C is encrypted with a public key framework, making
decryption impossible. The commands from the C&C are encrypted in a simpler manner and
can be decrypted if intercepted because the secret key is hardcoded in the malware.
Through monitoring, we were able to capture a large amount of commands sent to the
victims by the attackers, providing an unique view into this operation. Here’s a look at one of
the encrypted server replies:

Once a victim is infected and “checks in” with the server, the attackers send a template of
commands:

16/29

Next, the attackers try to move through the victim’s network using pre-defined or collected
passwords:

Listing all .doc files recursively is also a common “theme”:

17/29

In total, we have decoded several hundreds of these command packages delivered to the
victims, providing an unique insight into the inner workings of the attackers.
In addition to generic searches, some very specific lookups have been observed as well.
These include searches for:
*NATO*.msg
eu energy dialogue*.*
EU*.msg
Budapest*.msg
In this case, the attackers were interested to find e-mails related to “NATO”, “Energy
Dialogue within European Union” and so on.
For some of the C&C servers, the attackers implemented RSA encryption for the C&C logs,
which makes it impossible to decrypt them. This scheme was implemented in April 2014.

18/29

Lateral movement and upgrade to more sophisticated backdoors
Once a victim is compromised, the attackers upload several tools that are used for lateral
movement.
One such tool observed in the attacks and saved as “C:Documents and SettingsAll
usersStart MenuProgramsStartupwinsvclg.exe” is:
Name: winsvclg.exe
MD5: a3cbf6179d437909eb532b7319b3dafe
Compiled: Tue Oct 02 13:51:50 2012
This is a keylogger tool that creates %temp%~DFD3O8.tmp. Note: the filename can change
across victims. On one Central Asian government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs victim system,
the filename used was “adobe32updt.exe“.
In addition to these custom tools, we observed the usage of standard administration utilities.
For instance, another tool often uploaded by the attackers to the victim’s machine is
“winrs.exe”:
Name: winrs.exe
MD5: 1369fee289fe7798a02cde100a5e91d8
This is an UPX packed binary, which contains the genuine “dnsquery.exe” tool from
Microsoft, unpacked MD5: c0c03b71684eb0545ef9182f5f9928ca.

19/29

In several cases, an interesting update has been observed — a malware from a different,
yet related family.
Size: 275,968 bytes
MD5: e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f
Compiled: Thu Nov 08 11:05:35 2012

MD5: 071d3b60ebec2095165b6879e41211f2
Compiled: Thu Nov 08 11:04:39 2012
This backdoor is more sophisticated and belongs to the next level of cyber-espionage tools
called the “Carbon system” or Cobra by the Turla attackers. Several plugins for the “Carbon
system” are known to exist.

Decoded configuration for e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f
Note: the command and control servers www.losguayaberos[.]com and
thebesttothbrushes[.]com have been sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab.
Other packages delivered to the victims include:
MD5: c7617251d523f3bc4189d53df1985ca9
MD5: 0f76ef2e6572befdc2ca1ca2ab15e5a1
These top level packages deploy both updated Epic backdoors and Turla Carbon system
backdoors to confirmed victims, effectively linking the Epic and Turla Carbon operations
together.
The Turla Carbon dropper from these packages has the following properties:
MD5: cb1b68d9971c2353c2d6a8119c49b51f
This is called internally by the authors “Carbon System”, part of the “Cobra” project, as it can
be seen from the debug path inside:

20/29

This acts as a dropper for the following modules, both 32 and 64 bit:

The Carbon system is in essence an extensible platform, very similar to other attack
platforms such as the Tilded platform or the Flame platform. The plugins for the Carbon
system can be easily recognized as they always feature at least two exports named:
ModuleStart
ModuleStop

Carbon system plugin with characteristic exports
21/29

Several Epic backdoors appear to have been designed to work as Carbon system plugins as
well – they require a specialized loader to start in victim systems that do not have the Carbon
system deployed.
Some modules have artifacts which indicate the Carbon system is already at version 3.x,
although the exact Carbon system version is very rarely seen in samples:

The author of the Carbon module above can be also seen in the code, as “gilg”, which also
authored several other Turla modules.
We are planning to cover the Turla Carbon system with more details in a future report.

22/29

Language artifacts
The payload recovered from one of the mothership servers (at
newsforum.servehttp[.]com/wordpress/wp-includes/css/img/upload.php, MD5:
4dc22c1695d1f275c3b6e503a1b171f5, Compiled: Thu Sep 06 14:09:55 2012) contains two
modules, a loader/injector and a backdoor. Internally, the backdoor is named
“Zagruzchik.dll”:

23/29

The word “Zagruzchik” means “boot loader” in Russian.
The Control panel for the Epic motherships also sets the language to codepage “1251”:

Codepage 1251 is commonly used to render Cyrillic characters.
There are other indications that the attackers are not native English language speakers:
Password it´s wrong!
Count successful more MAX
File is not exists
File is exists for edit
The sample e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f that was delivered to several Epic
victims as an upgraded backdoor, has the compilation code page language set to
“LANG_RUSSIAN”.

24/29

The threat actor behind the “Epic” operation uses mainly hacked servers to host their
proxies. The hacked servers are controlled through the use of a PHP webshell. This shell is
password protected; the password is checked against an MD5 hash:

The MD5 “af3e8be26c63c4dd066935629cf9bac8” has been solved by Kaspersky Lab as
the password “kenpachi”. In February 2014 we observed the Miniduke threat actor using the
same backdoor on their hacked servers, although using a much stronger password.
Once again, it is also interesting to point out the usage of Codepage 1251 in the webshell,
which is used to render Cyrillic characters.
There appears to be several links between Turla and Miniduke, but we will leave that for a
future blogpost.

Victim statistics

25/29

On some of the C&C servers used in the Epic attacks, we were able to identify detailed
victim statistics, which were saved for debugging purposes by the attackers.
This is the country distribution for the top 20 affected countries by victim’s IP:

26/29

According to the public information available for the victims’ IPs, targets of “Epic” belong to
the following categories:
Government
Ministry of interior (EU country)
Ministry of trade and commerce (EU country)
Ministry of foreign/external affairs (Asian country, EU country)
Intelligence (Middle East, EU Country)
Embassies
Military (EU country)
Education
Research (Middle East)
Pharmaceutical companies
Unknown (impossible to determine based on IP/existing data)

Summary
When G-Data published their Turla paper, there were few details publicly available on how
victims get infected with this malware campaign. Our analysis indicates this is a
sophisticated multi-stage infection; which begins with Epic Turla. This is used to gain a
foothold and validate the high profile victim. If the victim is interesting, they get upgraded to
the Turla Carbon system.
Most recently, we observed this attack against a Kaspersky Lab user on August 5, 2014,
indicating the operation remains fresh and ongoing.
Note: A full analysis of the Epic attacks is available to the Kaspersky Intelligent
Services customers. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com
We would like to add the following at the end of the blogpost, right before the detection
names:
