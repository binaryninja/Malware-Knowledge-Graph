Since February 27, 2022, the Twitter @ContiLeaks account and other online personas have
been leaking communications containing details about threat actors and their operations.
The leaks include more than 160,000 messages exchanged among nearly 500 threat actors
between January 2020 and March 2022. The messages reveal close relationships among

multiple threat groups and details about the GOLD ULRICK and GOLD BLACKBURN threat
groups' operations. Leaked source code and tool repositories offer unprecedented insights
into previously unknown threat actors.
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have historically linked most of the
activity referenced in the leaked data to two disparate but highly integrated threat groups:
GOLD BLACKBURN - This financially motivated cybercrime group has been active
since June 2014. The threat actors authored and operated the TrickBot malware from
late 2016 until March 2022 and have also distributed malware such as BazarLoader,
Anchor, Zloader, and Buer Loader.
GOLD ULRICK - This financially motivated cybercrime group active has been active
since mid-2018. It focuses exclusively on organization-wide ransomware attacks. The
group distributed the Ryuk ransomware from August 2018 until early 2021 and has
distributed the Conti ransomware since early 2020.

In GOLD ULRICK incidents analyzed by CTU™ researchers, the initial access vector used to
distribute the Ryuk and Conti ransomware was usually TrickBot, BazarLoader, or another
GOLD BLACKBURN malware payload. The PowerShell Empire and Cobalt Strike Beacon
command and control (C2) servers used in these attacks were frequently shared by TrickBot,
indicating that a single entity maintained infrastructure for both threat groups. However, other
threat groups have used TrickBot to distribute ransomware such as RansomExx (also known
as 777), Maze, and LockBit.
The leaked messages reveal that the 'Stern' persona is a leader who makes key
organizational decisions, distributes payroll, manages crises, and interacts with other threat
groups (see Figure 1). Stern's purview includes all aspects of ransomware distribution as
well as TrickBot and BazarLoader operation. This relationship suggests that Stern has a
leadership role in both GOLD BLACKBURN and GOLD ULRICK. The messages also include
individuals representing GOLD CRESTWOOD (Emotet), GOLD MYSTIC (LockBit), and
GOLD SWATHMORE (IcedID), who frequently communicate with Stern and other GOLD
ULRICK and GOLD BLACKBURN members. Despite the connection to multiple groups, CTU
analysis does not suggest that Stern leads all of these groups.

The chats reveal a mature cybercrime ecosystem across multiple threat groups with frequent
collaboration and support. Members of groups previously believed to be distinct collaborated
and frequently communicated with members of other threat groups. This interconnectivity
shows these groups' motivations and relationships. It highlights their resourcefulness and
ability to leverage subject matter expertise within the groups.
A June 29, 2021 message from the 'Mango' persona to Stern highlights the groups' biweekly
salary breakdown (see Figure 2). It describes an operation with 81 people. The average
salary per individual is approximately $1,800 USD per month, exceeding the average
Russian salary of approximately $540 USD per month. As of July 1, 2021, the Bitcoin
address at the bottom of the message had received 2.31 bitcoins (approximately $80,000
USD at that time).

Other leaked data included more than a dozen dossiers of threat actors with photos, names,
addresses, phone numbers, bank account numbers, passport, and citizenship information.
The identity and motives of the individual who leaked these dossiers are unknown, so CTU
researchers cannot determine if the data is reliable or if it was modified before release. The
individual expressed anger toward Russia, so the leaks could be in response to pro-Russian
statements GOLD ULRICK posted on its leak site.
As of March 6, 2022, GOLD ULRICK was posting new victims to its leak site. The group's
attacks have impacted hundreds of victims and include many high-profile attacks. The
exposure from the leaked data could cause the group to cease operation, or could be
another obstacle for the threat actors to overcome.
