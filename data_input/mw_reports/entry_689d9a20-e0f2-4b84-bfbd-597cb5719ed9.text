Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

Introduction
Our analysis of Black Atlas has given us a lot of information on the tools used by cybercriminals their operations, as
well as how they utilize these tools in targeting PoS systems. We learned about their methods of initial compromise
as well as how they use pen-testing tools to gain further access into the network. We also found Gorynych—a modular
botnet client that was retrofitted to use BlackPOS and target PoS systems, as well as a variety of other tools that the
Black Atlas operators used to penetrate networks.
In this report, we will look further into these tools and techniques, how they work, and what network administrators
can do to protect their networks against these threats.

Technical Details
Probing and Penetrating the Environment
Through the use of the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™, we have been able to determine that the attackers
used several tools to probe and compromise an IP address list:
Tool Name

Why and when is it used?

Medusa Parallel
Network Login Auditor

Enumerates services and tries to authenticate via brute force method. Supports multiple
protocols.

Simple SMTP Scanner

Used to fingerprint a remote SMTP server and guess which mail software is used on a
remote server. Though most environments are firewalled, the name of the service that
answers on a known port may provide more context of the underlying network infrastructure
hidden behind the firewall.

Fast SYN Scanner

Scans port on a given range of hosts, using a specified interface, to see which host would
respond back from a TCP SYN packet.

nVNC Scanner
package

Can take a combination of IPs, and try a list of passwords to authenticate on a VNC port.

nCrack

High-speed network authentication cracking tool. Supports multiple protocols.

nPCA Bruter

Scans port on a given range of hosts.

3

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

Fast RDP Brute GUI
v2.0 package

Scans for a list of IP addresses and uses a user name/password combination for
authentication.

Sentry MBA Universal
Crack/bruteforce

Universal HTTP dictionary brtueforcer/cracking tool. Highly configurable.

RealVNC viewer 5.2.3

One a VNC is exposed, simple use VNC Viewer to attempt to connect to the port.

Cain and Abel

Password recovery tool for the Microsoft Operating System. Allows recovery of various
passwords by sniffing the network, cracking encrypted passwords using dictionary, bruteforce, etc.

RDP Scanner X

Scans for a list of IP addresses and uses a username/password combination for
authentication.

After gaining access to the initial host, the attacker now uses these tools to move further within the network:
Tool name

Why and when is it used?

Advanced IP Scanner

Free, fast and easy to use IP scanner, used to identify internal hosts.

Radmin

A popular remote control software alternative to the default Remote Desktop. Can be
planted on other hosts to further penetrate within the network.

PushVNC package

Once inside a network, can be used to remotely push and start the VNC service.

Fgdump

Newer version of pwdump tool for extracting NTLM and LanMan password hashes from
Windows.

Dameware

Dameware, like Radmin, is a popular remote control software alternative to the default
Remote Desktop. Can be planted on other hosts to further penetrate within the network.

VNC Password
Recovery Tool

A small utility that can recover passwords stored by the VNC application.

4

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

xDedic RDP Patch

RDP Patcher Can create a new local account that can be used if the initially compromised
account has changed passwords

Point-of-Sale Threats
Apparently, the website we wrote about earlier wasn't the only one that distributed CenterPOS and Katrina. Activity
on that cybercriminals’ toolbox had slowed down around the time we wrote about it, and they have set up shop
somewhere else. Here are other contents that we found:

Comparing the files that were found previously, this is definitely an upgrade from their previous approach. Let's start
with the one of the batch files in use, AutoExe1.bat:

6

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

Some observations from AutoExe1.bat:
1. It uses bitsadmin.exe to download the files that would load NewPOSThings. Background Intelligent Transfer
System (BITS) usually comes into play when the operating system downloads updates from Microsoft of the
local WSUS server. But it can be used to download files such as the malware shown above. The method of
downloading malware through BITSADMIN has been talked about since as early as 2013.
2. It now clears the system events to cover tracks.
3. It also has one call to delete AutoExe.bat. This last instruction appears to be a typo, since it deleted
AutoExe1.bat instead.
There is an AutoExe.bat, but it loaded the Neutrino/Kasidet variant that had PoS functionality.

The batch file has a very similar approach for loading this particular Neutrino/Kasidet variant. Both batch files
combined two batch files from the previous approach that they had—namely Setup.bat and ClearEventN.bat.
There are some files that seem to be reused in this toolbox though, like recon.exe, X.bat (though they removed the
Dropbox download location), as well as the binaries of CenterPOS and NewPoSThings.
The differences, however, do not stop there.

New Items in NewPosThings
There weren’t many changes done to the NewPoSThings malware from a technical standpoint. With the discovery of
the 64-bit variants and the usage of v3.0 last April, version 3.0 and 64-bit malware types became more
commonplace to the point that we rarely see the version 2.x anymore.

TSPY64_POSNEWT.SM

Aside from just using NewPOSThings and variants of Alina and Kasidet/Neutrino, we’ve also seen an old PoS threat
called Project Hook and an installation of PwnPOS all of which have the same installation method used.

With these new items, on the following page is a graph to illustrate:

Sifting through the latest samples of NewPOSThings, Project Hook, PwnPOS, Alina, and Kasidet/Neutrino, they all
indicate that the latest infections are all related: the file characteristics, the method of distribution as well as the
source.

Use of Known PoS Malware Threats
Case Study: Healthcare
The most interesting observed infections affected organizations in the healthcare industry. These seem to be the
unlikely target for PoS malware, but nowadays, it doesn’t really matter to cybercriminals as long as there is money to
steal. In fact, they have recently become more likely to infiltrate other businesses apart from retailers.
To start, let’s look at samples.

Alina (Spark)

Take note that BKDR_GORYNYCH.SM was found in Temporary Internet Files as loader[1].exe, which indicates that it
was downloaded directly from the browser. It wouldn’t make sense if the user actually just tried to download it, unless
there is someone else in control of the system. We mentioned earlier that the attacker makes use of several tools
such as RDP scanners and password brute forcers as its initial step to find its targets and gain access to the system.
This possibility is something to consider, and it is most likely the point of entry in this case since one of the endpoints
in this network had an open RDP port. If a brute force attack is successful, the attacker will be in full control and will
be ready to plant malware through direct download.

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

There are a few things worth noting here:


We know from the Smart Protection Network that some of these files were placed into the system using
pcAnywhere. This means that the initial compromise happened in another computer within the network.
Some hacking tools related to Remote Desktop were found in the system, which includes CRCK_PATCH, a
TermSrv patch that enables concurrent remote desktop sessions so that it is not limited to only one user
accessing the computer at a time. Another hacking tool is HKTL_RDPPatcher, which allows the attacker to create
a new RDP administrator account so that he would still have access to the machine even after the password has
been changed. Note that pcAnywhere and Remote Desktop were used here to blend with the usual administrative
methods used. It could be assumed that other methods would be applied by the threat actor should the
environment be using other remote desktop utilities.



The use of RATs such as Spy Net enables a stealthier and more convenient approach for controlling the
compromised machine. Other functionalities like password grabbing and keylogging may also be used to easily
exfiltrate information. The same can be said about Gorynych, which is also capable of information theft. These
two will be discussed further in the next sections.



The final step in this attack is to install a PoS threat. The attacker evidently has a wide variety of POS malware in
its toolset as seen in this infection.
We are already familiar with the listed PoS threats above – BlackPOS, Project Hook, Posnewt, Alina, Katrina. Spy
Net has also been around for a few years now. But what’s BKDR_GORYNYCH? Upon analysis, we figured that
we’ve just discovered a new player in the game of credit card theft.

12

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

Gorynych or Diamond Fox
Technically, Gorynych is not considered a PoS malware as it wasn’t designed to attack PoS systems. It can be likened
to a bot and/or an information stealer that downloads BlackPOS to make use of its RAM scraping functionality. So is
Gorynych simply a downloader that delivers random malware to infected computers? Apparently not. In fact,
Gorynych complements BlackPOS so well that it even knows what its output file would be. The output is uploaded to
its control panel to view all the dumped credit card numbers in memory.

The images used for Gorynych’s control panel login page are called “Kartoxa,” another name for BlackPOS.

Aside from the POS plugin, there are other modules that make up this malware’s entirety. These are usually
downloaded from a subdirectory in the C&C with fixed names.

Most of the time, these functionalities are not used altogether. The most frequently used ones have been highlighted
to recognize the attacker’s intent in using this malware. We already have a clue from its toolset and we are not
surprised to see that the attacker is mainly concerned with passwords, key logs and credit card information.
Gorynych without the plugins can do only a few things which are mostly for installation and anti-analysis. Some of
these routines can be enabled or disabled depending on the builder options selected. Let’s examine that in the next

14

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

When building Gorynych, the user is allowed to customize some things like the connection, security keys, installation
details, and anti-analysis options.

You’ll notice on the installation tab that the keylogger and POS grabber are disabled by default. However, these are
enabled in the infections that we see. This strengthens our theory that the target of the attacker(s) are mainly POS
systems.
Once done, the configuration is saved and encrypted in either the resource section or the end of the file. It is saved in
the resource by default.

The initial download of the keylogger and PoS plugins would have the user-agent similar to that of the browser of the
affected endpoint.

However, the other plugins (ftp, rdp, mail, ins, and passwords) are downloaded via the “vb wininet” user-agent.

After downloading its plugins, Gorynych reports to its server via gate.php using HTTP POST. This time, it uses its own
user-agent that can be found in its configuration file. The parameters consist of system information used to profile the
bot, mainly for identification in the Gorynych control panel.

The posted information is encrypted, but as pointed out in a blog post by Cylance, instead of using the encryption key
itself, it XOR’ed the entire string with its key length.
This is how it looks like when decrypted:

The rest of the stolen information are also uploaded via HTTP POST with the markers "--Xu02=$" and "--Xu02=$--"
at the beginning and end of data.

Spy Net RAT
It is clear that in this attack, Gorynych was used to steal sensitive information such as user credentials and key logs.
But in order to maintain full control, the attackers need a Remote Access Tool which in this case was Spy Net.
Builder
The Spy Net builder is pretty straightforward. There are a wide variety of options that can be configured for Spy Net,
including the AutoRun, installation directory, error messages, mutex name, and process injection. The user can also
choose which anti-analysis or anti-debugging features will be enabled or disabled. Aside from the C&C server, the
RAT can also send its logs to an FTP server if available.

Victimology

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

As mentioned, a big part of Operation Black Atlas started off by scanning an IP range, knocking on the doors to see
which ports are open, and attempting to brute-force their way through remote desktop protocols. By identifying the
environments that fall victim to this methodology, we found that a good majority were small-to-medium businesses
(SMBs) that have opened these ports intentionally. Given the nature of the business, we can assume that the opened
ports were most likely for outsourced IT services or so that their in-house IT admins (if they exist) can get back in the
network from remote locations.
SMBs have different challenges as they need to figure out how technology solutions can help grow their business, try
to balance IT spending costs for upgrades or maintenance, or even just keep the business running. With this, it comes
with no surprise that there may be some quick fixes or misconfigurations here and there that may have lesser chance
of happening in a larger environment with a dedicated IT staff.
Certainly, there are regional peculiarities that we have observed. For example, there was a minor hit in Switzerland for
a PwnPOS sample that they tried to plant on a terminal that was using PaniPOS Terminal. The software, PaniPOS
Terminal, was created by a local Swiss company called Panipro AG. Therefore, we know that the threat actors would
not go seeking for the same kind of terminal in, say, Latin America. That being said, Operation Black Atlas had a wide
variety of PoS threats to choose from and, for the purpose of focusing on a specific region in this write-up, we would
be mentioning some observed data but most of the material would cover what we have observed within the United
States.
The two PoS threats that may have the most significant impact would be NewPOSThings and Gorynych. The
distribution of NewPOSThings concentrated within the United States, some in Europe and finally a few hits in Asia.

While we were able to see infections in Asia (Australia, India, Taiwan), Europe (Germany, United Kingdom) and Latin
America (Chile) for Gorynych, infections within the United States looked quite interesting as there is a high possibility
22

of finding both Gorynych and NewPOSThings. We then looked into some of the affected establishments of Operation
Black Atlas where we have spotted both indicators of Gorynych and NewPOSThings:






A multi-state healthcare provider and two dental clinics
A machine manufacturer
A technology company focusing on insurance services
A gas station that has a multi-state presence
A beauty supply shop

Not so much can be said for finding both Gorynych and NewPOSThings in a gas station or a beauty supply shop, but
finding a bot that had information-stealing capability in the industries of insurance, manufacturing, and healthcare
certainly can raise alarm. For example, any individual who walks into a dental clinic or ask services from a healthcare
provider would be required to present proof of identification, fill out forms that may contain sensitive information like
an individual’s Social Security number (SSN) or driver’s license ID number, and even present proof of insurance. If
paper forms were initially used by patients to fill in their information, then there would be manual data input to the
back-end healthcare system. All of these data that require keystrokes can be easily monitored by Gorynych’s
keylogger functionality.
Finally, and though we have not seen this in action, the Bitcoin wallet information theft functionality presents
something as a forward looking feature. As early as later 2013 and early 2014, there have been healthcare providers
who have supported payment through bitcoins to maintain significant anonymity protections for patients. Being able
to tap into that anonymous financial stream would be quite lucrative for cybercriminals.

Attribution
No strong attribution can be made at this time. However, the tools used for initial entry are seen, discussed and
distributed in multiple hacking and security forums sourced within the last two years.
In combination to the tools being used, we have observed some of the files packaged specifically for some affected
environments are resemble languages spoken in Central Europe, like aiureala.zip (meaning “nonsense” in some
translations), as well as a file named oricenume.exe (sometimes meaning “any name”). Aside from this, some of the
uncovered log files have a time stamp format popularly used in Europe (dd/mm/yyyy).
It would also be worth noting that the link to the infrastructure being used in this operation and to PwnPOS is quite
strong. In our write-up of PwnPOS, the method being used for data exfiltration would be the use of email, as seen
below.

Notice that the email address of the recipient was also used as the administrative contact of a domain related to Spy
Net.

One other domain used in the Spynet was registered by “Petrov Strong”. The same name was used to register an
account at a carding forum around September 2015.

This does not, however, point us explicitly to anyone or any group in particular but it does highlight the following facts
about this threat actor/group:





The toolset would be from security forums that discuss such tools. The group or the actors have been
keeping themselves updated with the recent tools, and may have a strong background in network
penetration methodologies.
The threat actor or group has a long history with point-of-sale-related threats, having access to different
RAM scraper families.
With the use of remote access Trojans to maintain control of the compromised environment, the group may
be interested in other aspects of the network.

The use of existing tools within the environment also paints a picture that the group, or the threat actors, has a big
picture in mind – they are able to take the environment with the correct context, and use it for their own advantage. It
also shows that enough reconnaissance has been performed so that they can use effective methodologies against
the environment that they intend to compromise. However, unlike network penetration testers, they do not have
restricted goals, has tricks up their sleeve to prolong their access and seek out other forms of interesting data for
their own benefit.

Conclusion
25

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks

Our research indicates there is a high possibility of the threat actors having direct remote-access to the compromised
network at one point or another.
As early as 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon, Remote Access services already suffered high-volume
automated attacks -to quote:
“Remote access services (e.g., VNC, RDP) continue their rise in prevalence, accounting for 88% of all

breaches leveraging hacking techniques—more than any other vector. Remote services accessible from the
entire Internet, combined with default, weak, or stolen credentials continue to plague smaller retail and
hospitality organizations.”
Even though this has been said and acknowledged for the past three years, we cannot be 100% sure of the attackers'
methodology. It does not, however, hurt to be extra vigilant, and make sure that we do not forget what history and
past reporting have taught us in allowing remote access services. And even though we may create sufficiently strong
password combinations, we should make sure that our credentials do not get compromised, as well as have good
password policies in place. While a good antimalware solution may provide protection, a compromised account that
threat actors can use to reintroduce themselves within the environment renders those technology investments near
useless.
We have also seen threat actors persistently try to introduce PoS threats through creative means – such as commandline FTP. It is usually a given nowadays that we screen and limit items coming in through the publicly interfacing
firewall, or filter out items that traverse through web/HTTP and even apply filtering. However, we seldom inspect other
protocols that may be used to transfer files. A threat actor having direct remote-access to a terminal may simply
launch a command-line FTP and pull down other threats, efficiently evading the web/HTTP filtering. As efficient as
getting in through remote-desktop utilities is, the same entry vector like the native Microsoft Remote Desktop and
Symantec PCAnywhere application would have efficient means to transfer files from one host to another. This
completes not only the initial entry point but assists with lateral movement as well.
Something specific to Gorynych is the bot’s ability to get bitcoin wallet information - passwords stored in either RDP
sessions, browsers or FTP clients, as well as key strokes (with its use of a keylogger). These types of information
stealers, as well as cracking utilities and hack tools, should be given serious attention once discovered. The existence
of such malicious software within the network should be tracked, endpoints where these utilities have landed should
be triaged, and a process should be in place to handle this kind of incident does occur. For example, finding a
keylogger on a terminal that processes insurance claims or data entry for patient information should be immediately
dealt with as this could be close to a serious data breach as the attacker can now access the patient portal and take
hold of patient information data.
We know that Black Atlas’ current operations are somewhat successful as they have been able to compromise some
interesting victims that, for them, are low-hanging fruits and are easy prey. Furthermore, we believe that this method
of operation would continue, improve and may still be utilized in the future by other threat actor groups.

Recommendations
The following items have been mentioned in the 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon, and we will restate them here as they still hold true:
For smaller organizations:
26

Trend Micro | Operation Black Atlas: How Modular Botnets are Used in Attacks





Implement a firewall or ACL on remote access services.
Change default credentials of POS systems and other internet-facing devices.
If a third party vendor is handling the two items above, make sure they’ve actually done them.

For large organizations:





Eliminate unnecessary data; keep tabs on what’s left.
Ensure essential controls are met; regularly check that they remain so.
Monitor and mine event logs.
Evaluate your threat landscape to prioritize your treatment strategy.

27

We would like to add that small organizations may want to look into consider implementing some items for large
organizations – essential controls on passwords and network/system security, as well as monitor and mine event
logs would be very beneficial any size of an organization. We’d like to also note that network segmentation and
isolation of the cardholder data environment from other networks, and should be a standard practice not only for big
retailers and stores.
Trend Micro is monitoring this ongoing activity, and would make follow-up reports on this if necessary. To read up on
