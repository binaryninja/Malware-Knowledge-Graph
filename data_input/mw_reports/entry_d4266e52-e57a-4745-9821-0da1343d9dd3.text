This presentation has many questions
How do Black Banshee’s tools, infrastructure, targeting and strategic objectives intersect?

How do they connect Black Banshee’s campaigns in a tight-knight web of activity?
What function do Black Banshee’s campaigns perform, among other North Korea-based cyber threats?

To answer them, we need to:
Understand the malware

Map out the infrastructure

Pinpoint their intersections

To catch a Banshee

Cluster the campaigns

Identify the strategic targets

US policy
Supranational bodies

Strategic targets (sanctions;
THAAD deployment issues)

Investments
Dissidents; minorities;
reporters on DPRK

To catch a Banshee
PwC UK

Progressive evolution from
Banshee’s 2019 targeting,
in 2020 Black Artemis has
“picked up” some traditional
Black Banshee targets (e.g.
energy, nuclear).
Black Shoggoth & Banshee
continue overlapping in
targeting of journalists,
NGOs, plus East & SE Asia.
