a cybergang behind the infection of hundreds
of websites all over the world
group-ib.com/media/night-fury/

Operators of the JavaScript-sniffer family, dubbed «GetBilling» by Group-IB, were arrested
in Indonesia. The arrest came as a result of a joint operation «Night Fury» initiated
by INTERPOL’s ASEAN Cyber Capability Desk (ASEAN Desk) that involved Indonesian
Cyber Police (BARESKRIM POLRI (Dittipidsiber)) and Group-IB’s APAC Cyber
Investigations Team. The operation is still ongoing in other five ASEAN countries with which
the intelligence was also shared. This case marks the first successful multi-jurisdictional
operation against the operators of JavaScript-sniffers in the region. According to Group-IB’s
data, the suspects have managed to infect hundreds of ecommerce websites in various
locations, including in Indonesia, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany,
Brazil, and some other countries. Payment and personal data of thousands of online
shoppers from Asia, Europe, and the Americas have been stolen.
The three suspects with the initials «ANF» (27 y.o.), «K» (35 y.o.), and «N» (23 y.o.) were
arrested in December 2019 in two different regions in Indonesia — Special Region
of Yogyakarta and Special Capital Region of Jakarta — as part of the joint operation «Night
Fury» carried out by Indonesian Cyber Police and INTERPOL with the help of Group-IB’s
Cyber Investigations team. During the special operation, Indonesian Cyber Police seized
laptops, mobile phones of various brands, CPU units, IDs, BCA Token, ATM cards. The

suspected operators of the GetBilling JavaScript-sniffer family are charged with the theft
of electronic data, which carries up to a 10-year jail sentence in accordance with Indonesian
criminal code.
Strong and effective partnerships between police and the cybersecurity industry are essential
to ensure law enforcement worldwide has access to the information they need to address the
scale and complexity of today’s cyberthreat landscape. This successful operation is just one
example of how law enforcement are working with industry partners, adapting and applying
new technologies to aid investigations and ultimately reduce the global impact
of cybercrime,» concluded Mr Jones.

INTERPOL’s Director of Cybercrime
There are many challenges and obstacles in cross-border hi-tech crime investigations like
this. The Night Fury Operation showed that these obstacles could only be overcome with
close collaboration between national law enforcement, international organizations and
private companies. Effective multi-jurisdictional coordination of efforts between Indonesia’s
Cyber Police, INTERPOL and Group-IB allowed to attribute the crimes, establish the
perpetrators behind the JS-sniffer and arrest them. But more importantly to protect the
community and raise public awareness about the problem of cybercrime and its impact.

With cybercrime being a growing threat across the region, the ASEAN Desk was launched
by INTERPOL to assist law enforcement agencies enhance their proactive response against
cybercrime. Through this operation, it is clear that timely intelligence sharing and coordinated
actions are the ways forward to effectively combat cybercrime regionally and globally.

JavaScript-sniffers (JS-sniffers) targeting ecommerce websites is a type of malicious
JavaScript code, designed to steal customer payment and personal data such as credit card
numbers, names, addresses, logins, phone numbers, and credentials from payment
systems, and etc. Group-IB has been tracking the GetBilling JS-sniffer family since 2018.
The analysis of infrastructure that was controlled by the suspected operators of GetBilling
arrested in Indonesia, carried out by Group-IB’s Cyber Investigations team, revealed that
they have managed to infect nearly 200 websites in Indonesia, Australia, Europe, the United
States, South America, and some other countries. However, the investigation in other
ASEAN countries continues, and the number of websites infected with GetBilling family
is likely to be higher. According to the investigation, stolen payment data was used by the
suspects to buy goods, such as electronic devices or other luxury items, which they tried
to resell online in Indonesia at below the market price.

Group-IB Cyber Investigations team determined that some of the GetBilling’s infrastructure
was located in Indonesia. Upon discovery of this information, INTERPOL’s ASEAN Desk
promptly notified Indonesian cyber police. Further investigation discovered that the
GetBilling’s operators were not new to the world of cybercrime. To access their servers for
stolen data collection and their JS-sniffers’ control, they always used VPN to hide their real
location and identity. To pay for hosting services and buy new domains the gang members
only used stolen cards. Despite that, Indonesian cyber police in cooperation with INTEPROL
and Group-IB’s Cyber Investigations team managed to establish that the group was
operating from Indonesia.
This case showed the borderless nature of cybercrime — the operators of the JS-sniffer lived
in one country attacking ecommerce websites all around the world. It makes evidence
collection, identification of suspects, and prosecution more complicated. Another thing that
the case demonstrated vividly is that international cooperation and cyber intelligence data
exchange can help effectively tackle modern cyber threats. Thanks to Indonesian Cyber
Police and INTERPOL’s prompt actions, Night Fury became the first successful multijurisdictional operation against the operators of JavaScript-sniffers in the APAC region.
It is a great example of coordinated cross-border anti-cybercrime effort, and we are proud
that our threat intelligence and digital forensics expertise helped to establish the suspects.
We hope this will set a precedent for law enforcement in other jurisdiction too.

By leveraging its own infrastructure for monitoring of underground forums and cardshops,
Group-IB has collected comprehensive information about the carding market and is capable
of identifying various anomalies. According to Group-IB’s annual 2019 threat report, the
number of compromised cards uploaded to underground forums increased from 27.1 million
to 43.8 million in H2 2108-H1 2019 year-on-year. The size of the carding market, in turn,

grew by 33 percent and amounted to USD 879.7 million. The sale of CVV data is also on rise
today, having increased by 19 percent in the corresponding period, and one of the key
reasons behind this trend could be JavaScript-sniffers.
GetBilling family was first described in Group-IB’s 2019 report «Crime without punishment»
which is a deep dive into the world of JS‑sniffers. According to the author of the report Viktor
Okorokov, threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, at the time of the report’s publication,
in total Group-IB Threat Intelligence team discovered 38 families of JS-sniffers. Ever since,
the number of JS-sniffer families, discovered by the company, has almost doubled and
continues to grow. JS‑sniffers have caused many security incidents in past — the infection
of the British Airways website and mobile app, payment-card attack on the UK website of the
international company FILA etc. — and continue to gain popularity among cybercriminals.
Most recently, in December 2019, JS-sniffers hit the APAC infecting the websites
of Singaporean fashion brand «Love, Bonito.
To avoid big financial losses due to JS-sniffers, it’s recommended for online users to have
a separate pre-paid card for online payments, set spending limits on cards, used for online
shopping, or even use a separate bank account exclusively for online purchases. Online
merchants, in their turn, need to keep their software updated and carry out regular
cybersecurity assessments of their websites.
