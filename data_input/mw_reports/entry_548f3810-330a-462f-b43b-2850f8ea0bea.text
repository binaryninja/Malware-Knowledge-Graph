Iranian-backed hackers have stolen vast amounts of data from a major software company
that handles sensitive computer projects for the White House communications agency, the
U.S. military, the FBI and many American corporations, a cybersecurity firm told NBC News.
Citrix Systems Inc. came under attack twice, once in December and again Monday,
according to Resecurity, which notified the firm and law enforcement authorities.
Employing brute force attacks that guess passwords, the assault was carried out by the
Iranian-linked hacking group known as Iridium, which was also behind recent cyberattacks
against numerous government agencies, oil and gas companies and other targets, Charles
Yoo, Resecurity's president, said.
The hackers extracted at least six terabytes of data and possibly up to 10 terabytes in the
assault on Citrix, Yoo said. The attackers gained access to Citrix through several
compromised employee accounts, he said.
"So it's a pretty deep intrusion, with multiple employee compromises and remote access to
internal resources," he said.

While there is no evidence the attacks directly penetrated U.S. government networks, the
breach carries a potential risk that the hackers could eventually find their way into sensitive
government networks, experts said.
Citrix issued a statement Friday saying the FBI had informed the company Wednesday that it
had come under attack from "international cybercriminals" and that it was taking action "to
contain this incident."
"While our investigation is ongoing, based on what we know to date, it appears that the
hackers may have accessed and downloaded business documents," it said.
"At this time, there is no indication that the security of any Citrix product or service was
compromised."
The company did not specify over what time period it had come under the cyberattack, how
many employee accounts may have been compromised or other details. Citrix's statement
came in response to an NBC News request for comment late Thursday.
"Citrix deeply regrets the impact this incident may have on affected customers," it said.
The FBI declined comment.
Resecurity informed Citrix executives of the first cyberattack in a Dec. 28 email, Yoo said.
An analysis of the cyberattack indicated the hackers were focused in particular on FBIrelated projects, NASA and aerospace contracts and work with Saudi Aramco, Saudi
Arabia's state oil company, according to Yoo.
Yoo said his firm, which has been tracking the Iranian-linked group for years, has reason to
believe that Iridium broke its way into Citrix's network about 10 years ago, and has been
lurking inside the company's system ever since.
"Once an attacker goes into an environment and compromises one account, that's just the
first stage. And what we uncovered and through our own analysis is a very sophisticated
campaign," he said.
Citrix sells workplace software to government agencies and corporations around the world
that allow employees to work remotely from their own desktops or mobile devices off a
centralized data center.
Suzanne Spaulding, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, said
hacking government contractors provides a potential attack pathway into U.S. government
files. She cited the 2015 cyber attack on the federal Office of Personnel Management in
which private records on millions of individuals were compromised.

“Government contractors often hold sensitive information. Remember that the ‘OPM breach’
included breaches of contractors who were conducting background investigations for OPM
and were holding very sensitive information about individuals seeking or holding clearances,”
she said.
In the case of Citrix, even if the hack did not gain access to company operations, it’s possible
that adversaries could gain insights into the company’s network configuration and the
defenses of the government agencies, Spaulding said. And that would make hacking those
government agencies easier, she said.
The breach of Citrix's computer network gave the hackers access to private communication
with government agencies about various sensitive information technology projects involving
the FBI, the Missile Defense Agency, the Defense Logistics Agency, the White House
communications agency, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and others, Yoo
said.
DISA provides technical and communications support to the president, the vice president,
the secretary of defense and top commanders. The White House communications agency is
assigned the task of providing secure communications for the president and is manned by
U.S. military personnel.
Iridium targeted Citrix to get at the company’s government clients, Resecurity experts said.
"It's an ideal scenario to attack customers in various verticals including the government and
military," Yoo said.
The goal is to hack into sensitive U.S. government systems, he said. "We do believe that
they are being targeted."
Resecurity says the Iranian-backed Iridium is the same group that stole personal data on
Australian lawmakers and attacked the British Parliament in 2017, as NBC News reported
previously.
Last month, federal prosecutors charged former U.S. Air Force counterintelligence agent
Monica Elfriede Witt with espionage on behalf of Iran. Prosecutors said Witt had access to
highly classified information in her work in counterintelligence and defected to Iran in 2013.
U.S. authorities also charged four Iranians — Behzad Mesri, Mojtaba Masoumpour, Hossein
Parva and Mohamad Paryar — with allegedly using information she had provided to help
them target her former colleagues and conduct other cyberespionage.
Resecurity experts also said an Iranian-linked group with ties to Iridium was suspected in an
attempted hack into Israel's missile alert system more than a year ago.
Israel Defense Forces’ cyberdefense division successfully repelled the cyberassault on the
system, which provides early warning for incoming rockets and missiles, an IDF commander
told Israel Hayom’s weekend magazine.
