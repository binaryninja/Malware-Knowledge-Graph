Executive Summary
It took an attack on a major U.S. pipeline company, and the possibility of disruption in the
delivery of gasoline and jet fuel supplies to a large part of the country, to show the world that
ransomware attackers are not going to rest on their laurels after shaking down municipal
governments, school districts and hospitals.
DarkSide became one of the world’s most well-known hacking groups after the FBI
confirmed it is responsible for the highly publicized attack. When a shadowy group can sit
halfway across the world and, with a few keystrokes, threaten fuel supplies on the U.S.
Eastern Seaboard, then people do begin to take notice.

The impact of this attack is a reflection of the fact that ransomware operators are always on
the move – improving, automating and becoming more effective at targeting larger and larger
organizations. And they’re getting a lot more money for their efforts. The average cyber
ransom paid more than doubled in 2020 – to $312,493 – compared to 2019, according to the
2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report. So far in 2021, the average payment has nearly
tripled compared to the previous year – to about $850,000.
DarkSide has helped boost those averages by constantly focusing on ways to optimize its
business model in the short time it’s been active (we first encountered the group about a
year ago). Like other leading ransomware gangs, DarkSide recently embraced the
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. It outsourced code development, infrastructure
and operations and turned to the dark web to recruit new staff. As a result, the group can
now better focus on getting to know victims and targeting the most valuable types of data at
each organization, so it can extract the largest-possible ransom and boost the return on
investment in its criminal businesses.
The group started getting the attention of Unit 42 responders around October 2020. Since
then, we’ve been finding its fingerprints in a growing number of cases. What makes DarkSide
stand out is that the group has shown discipline we've traditionally only seen with nationstate actors – once the threat actors are in, they really dig in. That said, researchers have
noted DarkSide is likely a criminal network operating out of Russia; no one has yet directly
connected this to the Russian government.
It is interesting to note that back in November, one ransomware negotiation firm placed the
DarkSide operation on an internal restricted list after it announced plans to host infrastructure
in Iran – because Iran is under U.S. sanctions, facilitating payments to that location might run
afoul of the law.
Wherever they may be, there are indications that DarkSide attackers are highly experienced
and accomplished in mounting ransomware attacks. They clearly operate at the high end of
the ransomware ecosystem, focusing on a smaller pool of victims from whom they can
extract steep ransoms.

Cortex XSOAR: Cortex XSOAR’s ransomware content pack can immediately help
incident response, threat intelligence and SecOps teams to standardize and speed-up
post-intrusion response processes. This content pack automates most of the
ransomware response steps, allowing the incident response and SecOps teams to add
their guidance and input.
Next-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known command and control

Incident Response team.

Doubling and Tripling Their Pressure
The DarkSide group is aggressive in pressuring victims to pay. The threat actors don’t like to
be ignored. If victims don’t respond within two or three days, they send threatening emails to
employees. If that doesn’t work, they start calling senior executives on mobile phones. And
then they might threaten to start contacting customers or the press. And if that doesn’t work,
they might launch DDoS to take down external websites.
DarkSide is one of a growing number of ransomware operators that we have seen push the
boundaries of their trade to include these tactics, which we refer to as double and triple
extortion (others include Maze, Sodin, Clop, NetWalker and Conti).
These aggressive techniques build on the pattern of a typical ransomware attack, in which
files are encrypted and a ransom is demanded to decrypt them and restore access. Some
victims have backed up their data and do not see a need to pay for decryption keys to
restore access to corrupted systems. To prepare for that scenario, attackers also exfiltrate
sensitive information and study the victim’s network so they can up the ante if a target
refuses to pay. Then they threaten to release the data or launch a DDoS attack.
DarkSide even purports to operate under a “code of conduct,” seeking to position the group
as a trustworthy security “partner.” When victims pay, the threat actors will do things to
demonstrate good will including providing decryption keys or presenting evidence that
appears to show they have deleted stolen data. When asked, they will sometimes even tell
victims how they got in so security gaps can be closed.

DarkSide Ransomware: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
We have seen the following software and tools leveraged by the DarkSide group to gain
access to the victims’ data:

3/9

Legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools to maintain access into
a victim’s network, such as AnyDesk and TeamViewer.
Reconnaissance tools (ADRecon) to gather information about victims' Active
Directory prior to ransomware encryption.
A credential harvesting utility, Mimikatz, to dump password credentials.
PowerShell to carry out objectives, such as to apply GPO to create a scheduled task
to execute the ransomware.
Password management utilities such as Dashlane and LastPass to gain access to
additional credentials.
Utilities such as SQLDumper.exe to target SQL Server.
Victims’ internal messaging software to contact members of the IT staff.
File transferring software Rclone to exfiltrate data to cloud sharing websites (such as
PCloud and MegaSync).
Not many groups target non-Windows based systems, but in early 2021, DarkSide
introduced an ESXI version of their ransomware that targets VMware virtual machines
(VMs), which many organizations use to leverage server virtualization to reduce operating
costs and increase IT productivity.
Why does this matter? While we found that in many cases the client’s endpoint security did
its job protecting Windows PCs from being encrypted, because the servers were heavily
virtualized through VMware’s ESXI, the ESXI version of the ransomware made it possible for
the DarkSide group to encrypt the virtual infrastructure. The threat actors then essentially
shut down applications and services, such as file shares, DNS and email, leaving the victims’
networks in a deteriorated state or, worse, not functional.

What Can We Learn From This?
We’ve been noting for some time that ransomware attackers are becoming increasingly
professionalized, outsourcing code development, infrastructure and C2 operations, as well
as operating RaaS. Many of them are organized enough to respond to media inquiries and
operate victim hotlines.
As these threat actors continue to up their game, organizations need to follow best practices
to safeguard their data and protect against groups such as the DarkSide ransomware gang.
Organizations should also make sure to have an incident response plan in place in case of
an attack. Unit 42 offers a Ransomware Readiness Assessment to help organizations get
started on bolstering defenses.
