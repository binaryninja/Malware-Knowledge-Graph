Sophos Discovers ZeroAccess Using RLO

Yesterday, analysts at SophosLabs looked at a new ZeroAccess variant using some new tricks
to hide itself.
Or should I say old ones, which are seemingly rediscovered.
In his article, Sophos researcher James Wyke describes how ZeroAccess typically stores it’s
local data, but in this variant explains that “the malware authors are also using the right-to-left
override and several other non-printable Unicode characters in both file paths and registry
entries to further hinder identification and removal of the ZeroAccess components.”
If you recall, ZeroAccess is a notorious rootkit that made it’s first debut in 2011 and has since
produced many versions. I recently wrote about a self-debugging technique I found when
unpacking a ZeroAccess sample.
On the other hand, RLO is a simple trick used by malware to obfuscate text strings, usually for
the purpose of masking file extensions. Fellow Unpacked author Jean-Taggart wrote a blog
about this here.
We’ve been seeing a resurgence of the RLO trick as of late in malware samples, namely a
signed piece of Mac malware named ‘Janicab‘ which was documented by F-secure. While this
technique is far from new, it might be just enough to fool the average user or junior malware
analyst.

In the ZeroAccess sample discovered by Sophos, the malware obfuscated the registry key
value for the malware’s service, called ‘gupdate’. Implementation of RLO does not make the
service binary ‘GoogleUpdate.exe’ initially appear to be an EXE.

Is RLO making a comeback? It certainly seems like it.
Malware authors sometimes get lazy and recycle the same old tricks to hide their dirty deeds.
Nevertheless, the method used doesn’t always need to be complex if it gets the job done.
Other simple forms of rudimentary obfuscation that’s used a lot in malware is ROT13 and
base64 encoding, both of which I talked about here.
