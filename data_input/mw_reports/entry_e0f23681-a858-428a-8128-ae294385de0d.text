The login names and passwords for 1.3 million current and historically compromised
Windows Remote Desktop servers have been leaked by UAS, the largest hacker
marketplace for stolen RDP credentials.
With this massive leak of compromised remote access credentials, researchers, for the first
time, get a glimpse into a bustling cybercrime economy and can use the data to tie up loose
ends on previous cyberattacks.
Network admins will also benefit from a new service launched by cybersecurity firm
Advanced Intel called RDPwned that allows organizations to check whether their RDP
credentials have been sold in the marketplace.

What's so special about RDP?

1/10

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft remote access solution that allows users to
remotely access a Windows device's applications and desktop as if they were sitting in front
of the computer.
Due to its prevalent use in corporate networks, cybercriminals have built a thriving economy
around selling the stolen credentials for RDP servers.
While you may think that access to a corporate network would be expensive, the reality is
that threat actors sell remote desktop accounts for as little as $3 and typically not more than
$70.
Once a threat actor gains access to a network, they can perform a variety of malicious
activities. These activities include spreading further throughout the network, stealing data,
installing point-of-sale (POS) malware to harvest credit cards, installing backdoors for
further access, or deploy ransomware.
The use of Windows Remote Desktop Services to breach networks is so pervasive that the
FBI has stated that RDP is responsible for 70-80% of all network breaches leading to
ransomware attacks.
While all ransomware groups utilize RDP to some extent, one ransomware group known as
Dharma is known to predominantly use remote desktop to gain a foothold in corporate
networks.

UAS, the largest marketplace for RDP credentials
UAS, or 'Ultimate Anonymity Services,' is a marketplace that sells Windows Remote
Desktop login credentials, stolen Social Security Numbers, and access to SOCKS proxy
servers.
What makes UAS stand out is that it is the largest such marketplace, performs manual
verification of sold RDP account credentials, offers customer support, and provides tips on
how to retain remote access to a compromised computer.
"The market functions partially like eBay - a number of Suppliers work with the market. They
have a separate place to log in and upload the RDPs they hacked. The system will then
verify them, collect information about each one (os, admin access? internet speed, cpu,
memory etc etc), which is added to the listing."
"The supplier interface provides real time stats for the suppliers (what sold, what didn't,
what was sold but a refund was asked for, etc)."
"They also provide support if for some reason what you bought doesn't work. They do take
customer support seriously," a security researcher who wishes to remain anonymous told
BleepingComputer.

When purchasing stolen RDP accounts, threat actors can search for compromised devices
in a particular country, state, city, zip code, ISP, or operating system, allowing them to find
the specific server they need.

RDP servers currently sold on the UAS marketplace
Potential buyers can dig down deeper on each server to see the number of Windows
accounts, the Internet connection speed, the server's hardware, and more, as shown below.

RDP server specs for potential buyers
BleepingComputer was told that the marketplace will not sell any servers located in Russia
or a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country and runs a script that
automatically removes any that are found.
Even with this filtering of servers, UAS is currently selling a massive 23,706 RDP
credentials.

Secretly monitoring the UAS marketplace
Since December 2018, a group of security researchers have had secret access to the
database for the UAS marketplace and have been quietly collecting sold RDP credentials
for almost three years.
During this time period, the researchers have collected the IP addresses, usernames, and
passwords, for 1,379,609 RDP accounts that have been sold at UAS since the end of 2018.
This database had been shared with Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, who also shared a
redacted copy with BleepingComputer to review.
While we will not be listing any of the companies found in the database, we can say that the
listed RDP servers are from all over the world, including government agencies from sixtythree countries, with Brazil, India, and the United States being the top three.

There are also RDPs servers for many well-known, high-profile companies, with many
servers from the healthcare industry.
Furthermore, BleepingComputer has found many RDP servers in the database that belong
to organizations known to have suffered ransomware attacks over the past two years.
After analyzing the 1.3 million accounts in the database, BleepingComputer has pulled out
some interesting data that should be useful for all computer users and network admins:
The top five login names found in the sold RDP servers are 'Administrator', 'Admin',
'User', 'test', and 'scanner'.
The top five passwords used by the RDP servers are '123456', '123', 'P@ssw0rd',
'1234', and 'Password1'.
The top five represented countries in the database are United States, China, Brazil,
Germany, India, and the United Kingdom.
More complete stats are found at the end of the article.

RDPwned: Checking if your RDP is compromised
Vitali Kremez has launched a new service called RDPwned that allows companies and their
admins to check if their servers are listed in the database.
"The marketplace is tied to a number of high-profile breaches and ransomware cases
across the globe. A number of ransomware groups are known to purchase initial access on
UAS. This treasure trove of adversary-space data provides a lens into the cybercrime
ecosystem, and confirm that low hanging fruit, such as poor passwords, and internetexposed RDP remain one of the leading causes of breaches,"
"RDPwned will also help illuminate old breaches for which they never figured out initial
access. For others, it will give them a chance to resolve the security problem before it
becomes a breach," Kremez told BleepingComputer.
To use the service, Kremez told BleepingComputer that companies would need to submit
contact information from an executive or admin of the company, which Advanced Intel will
vet.
Once the user's identity is verified, Advanced Intel will confirm if their company's servers are
listed in RDPwned.
Visitors can perform this lookup via reverse DNS, IP addresses, and domain names.

All these years later and and people still struggle to make a password that wouldn't be
guessed by a 10 year old. Never ceases to amaze.

Great work. I think we should question whether is my RDP secure?
According to Microsoftâ€™s research, the one simple action you can take to prevent
99.9% of the attacks on your accounts is to use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
There are many solution providers in the market like RCDevs security solutions(free
up to 40 users), duo, onelogin, etc.
