29 ESET RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS

Foreword
Welcome to the Q3 2020 issue of the ESET Threat Report!
As the world braces for a pandemic-ridden winter, COVID-19 appears to be losing steam at
least in the cybercrime arena. With coronavirus-related lures played out, crooks seem to
have gone “back to basics” in Q3 2020. An area where the effects of the pandemic persist,
however, is remote work with its many security challenges.
This is especially true for attacks targeting Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which grew
throughout all H1. In Q3, RDP attack attempts climbed by a further 37% in terms of unique
clients targeted — likely a result of the growing number of poorly secured systems connected
to the internet during the pandemic, and possibly other criminals taking inspiration from
ransomware gangs in targeting RDP.
The ransomware scene, closely tracked by ESET specialists, saw a first this quarter — an
attack investigated as a homicide after the death of a patient at a ransomware-struck
hospital. Another surprising twist was the revival of cryptominers, which had been declining
for seven consecutive quarters. There was a lot more happening in Q3: Emotet returning
to the scene, Android banking malware surging, new waves of emails impersonating major
delivery and logistics companies….
This quarter’s research findings were equally as rich, with ESET researchers: uncovering
more Wi‑Fi chips vulnerable to KrØØk-like bugs, exposing Mac malware bundled with a
cryptocurrency trading application, discovering CDRThief targeting Linux VoIP softswitches,
and delving into KryptoCibule, a triple threat in regard to cryptocurrencies.
Besides offering recaps of these findings, this report also brings exclusive, previously
unpublished ESET research updates, with a special focus on APT group operations — see the
News From the Lab and APT Group Activity sections for updates on TA410, Sednit, Gamaredon
and more.
ESET also continued to contribute to the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, with four submissions
accepted in Q3. Other contributions of our teams include publishing a testing script for
Kr00k and a set of tools named Stadeo that facilitate the analysis of the Stantinko malware.
This quarter was bustling with virtual events, with ESET researchers sharing their knowledge
at both Black Hat USA and Asia, CARO, Virus Bulletin, DEF CON, Ekoparty, and many others. For
the upcoming months, we are excited to invite you to ESET’s talks and workshops at Botconf,
AVAR and CODE BLUE.
Happy reading, stay safe — and stay healthy!

ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 2

ESET researchers reveal that bugs similar to KrØØk affect more chip
brands than previously thought.
Our discovery of the KrØØk vulnerability
had a huge impact as the number of
affected devices was well over a billion
including devices by Apple, Samsung,
Amazon, and others that use the vulnerable chipsets. And we recently uncovered
that similar bugs affect even more chip
brands than previously thought.

FEATURED
STORY

From KrØØk to finding
related vulnerabilities
KrØØk [1] (formally CVE-2019-15126) is
a vulnerability in Broadcom and Cypress
Wi-Fi chips [2] that allows unauthorized
decryption of some WPA2-encrypted
traffic. Specifically, the bug has led to
wireless network data being encrypted
with a pairwise session key that is all
zeros instead of the proper session key

* * * *

that had previously been established in
the 4-way handshake. This undesirable
state occurs on vulnerable Broadcom
and Cypress chips following a Wi-Fi
disassociation.
Exploiting KrØØk allows adversaries to
intercept and decrypt (potentially sensitive) data of interest and, when compared to other techniques commonly used
against Wi-Fi, exploiting KrØØk has a significant advantage: the attackers do not
need to be authenticated and associated
to the WLAN. In other words, they don’t
need to know the Wi-Fi password.
We worked with the affected vendors
(as well as ICASI [3]) through a coordinated disclosure process before we
first publicly disclosed the flaw at the
RSA Conference in February 2020 [4].

Beyond KrØØk: Even more Wi‑Fi chips
vulnerable to eavesdropping
Miloš Cermák and Robert Lipovský

Overview of KrØØk — following a disassociation, data is transmitted encrypted
with an all zero session key
ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 3

The ensuing publicity brought the issue to the attention
of many more chipset and device manufacturers, some of
which discovered they also had vulnerable products — and
have since deployed patches. We are maintaining a list of
related vendor advisories on this site [5].

MediaTek and Microsoft Azure Sphere

While we did not observe CVE-2019-15126 in other Wi-Fi
chips than Broadcom and Cypress, we did find that similar vulnerabilities affected chips by other vendors. These
findings were first presented at Black Hat USA 2020 [6]
and we’re briefly outlining them below.

One of the affected devices is the ASUS RT-AC52U router.
Another, the Microsoft Azure Sphere development kit,
which we looked into as part of our Azure Sphere Security
Research Challenge partnership [7]. Azure Sphere uses MediaTek’s MT3620 microcontroller and targets a wide range
of IoT applications, including smart home, commercial,
industrial and many other domains.

Qualcomm — CVE-2020-3702
One of the chips we looked at, aside from those from
Broadcom and Cypress, was by Qualcomm. The vulnerability we discovered (which was assigned CVE-2020-3702) was
also triggerable by a disassociation and led to undesirable
disclosure of data by transmitting unencrypted data in
the place of encrypted data frames — much like with KrØØk.
The main difference is, however, that instead of being
encrypted with an all-zero session key, the data is not
encrypted at all.

We also observed the manifestation of a similar vulnerability (i.e. lack of encryption) on some Wi-Fi chips by
MediaTek.

According to MediaTek, software patches fixing the issue
were released during March and April 2020. The fix for
MT3620 was included in Azure Sphere OS version 20.07,
released in July 2020.

Conclusion
Our findings of KrØØk as well as its abovementioned
siblings highlight that we should not solely rely on a
single protective mechanism, such as WPA2. Instead, it’s
prudent to extend the same level of caution to WPA2-protected networks as we would on public, open Wi-Fi: make
sure you’re using encryption via SSL/TLS and a VPN.
WeLiveSecurity blogpost [8]

The screenshot shows a Wireshark log of a frame captured
after a disassociation was invoked on a Wi-Fi router fitted with a Qualcomm chip. Notice that the Protected flag
within the Frame Control Field is set to TRUE and the
frame appears to have CCMP parameters — both indicators
of an encrypted data frame. But the data was transmitted
unencrypted.
The devices we tested and found to have been vulnerable
are the D-Link DCH-G020 Smart Home Hub and the Turris
Omnia wireless router. Of course, any other unpatched devices using the vulnerable Qualcomm chipsets will also be
vulnerable.
Following our disclosure, Qualcomm was very cooperative
and in July released a fix to the proprietary driver used in
their officially supported products.

UEFI malware
EFIlock malware prevents computer from booting, asks
for ransom
ESET Research identified multiple malicious EFI bootloader samples. The malware,
detected by ESET products as EFI/EFIlock, displays a ransom message and prevents the
computer from booting. It can compromise computers that have the UEFI Secure Boot
feature disabled.

NEWS FROM
THE LAB

A dropper replaces the default EFI bootloader “bootx64.efi” and deletes Microsoft EFI
modules on the EFI system partition in order to boot a malicious one. The replaced
bootloader just displays a ransom message and executes an infinite loop. Despite
what the ransom message claims, EFIlock does not encrypt affected computers.

Evilnum group
More evil: A deep look at Evilnum and its toolset
ESET Research analyzed the operations of Evilnum, the cybercriminal group behind the
Evilnum malware, used in attacks against financial technology companies. While the
malware has been in the wild since at least 2018, the group’s activities have remained
largely under the radar.
The research reveals that the group’s toolset and infrastructure have evolved,
consisting of a mix of custom, homemade malware combined with tools purchased from
Golden Chickens, a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) provider whose infamous customers
include FIN6 and Cobalt Group.
According to ESET telemetry, Evilnum’s targets are financial technology companies;
for example, providing platforms and tools for online trading. The main goal of the
Evilnum group is to spy on its targets and obtain financial information from both the
targeted companies and their customers.

Latest findings from ESET Research
Labs across the world

Targets are approached with spearphishing emails that contain a link to a ZIP file
hosted on Google Drive. That archive contains several shortcut files that extract and

Mac threats

Cryptocurrency malware

Mac cryptocurrency trading application rebranded,
bundled with malware

KryptoCibule: The multitasking multicurrency
cryptostealer

ESET Research discovered websites distributing trojanized cryptocurrency trading
applications for Mac computers. These are legitimate apps wrapped with GMERA malware,
whose operators used them to steal sensitive victim information.

ESET Research discovered a previously undocumented malware family that spreads
through malicious torrents and that uses multiple tricks to squeeze as many cryptocoins as possible out of its victims. The threat, which we named KryptoCibule (derived
from the Czech and Slovak words for “crypto” and “onion”), primarily targets users in
the Czech Republic and Slovakia according to ESET telemetry.

In this new GMERA campaign, the legitimate Kattana trading application was extensively
rebranded — including setting up copycat websites — and the malware was bundled into
its installer. We saw four names used for the trojanized app: Cointrazer, Cupatrade,
Licatrade and Trezarus.
In addition to the analysis of the malware code, we also set up honeypots to try to
reveal the cybercriminals’ motivations. The activity witnessed confirmed that the
attackers have been collecting browser information, such as cookies and browsing
history, cryptocurrency wallets and screen captures.

This malware is a triple threat in regard to cryptocurrencies: It uses the victim’s
resources to mine coins, tries to hijack transactions by replacing wallet addresses in
the clipboard, and exfiltrates cryptocurrency-related files, all while deploying multiple
techniques to avoid detection. KryptoCibule makes extensive use of the Tor network and
the BitTorrent protocol in its communication infrastructure.

Linux threats
Banking malware
Mekotio: These aren’t the security updates you’re looking
for…
ESET researchers dissected Mekotio, a banking trojan targeting Spanish- and
Portuguese-speaking countries. Mekotio has several typical backdoor capabilities,
including taking screenshots, restarting affected machines, restricting access to
legitimate banking websites and, in some variants, even stealing bitcoins and
exfiltrating credentials stored by the Google Chrome browser.
Mekotio has been active since at least 2015 and, as with other banking trojans we have
investigated, shares common characteristics for this type of malware, such as being
written in Delphi, using fake pop-up windows and containing backdoor functionality. To
look less suspicious, Mekotio tries to impersonate a security update using a specific
message box.

Who is calling? CDRThief targets Linux VoIP softswitches
ESET Research discovered an interesting piece of malware, named CDRThief, that targets
Linux-based Voice over IP (VoIP) softswitches.
We noticed this malware in one of our sample sharing feeds, and as entirely new Linux
malware is a rarity, it caught our attention. What was even more interesting was that it
quickly became apparent that this malware targeted a specific Linux VoIP platform.
The primary goal of the malware is to exfiltrate various private data from a
compromised softswitch, including call detail records (CDRs). CDRs contain metadata
about VoIP calls such as caller and callee IP addresses, starting time of the call, call
duration, calling fee, etc. To steal this metadata, the malware queries internal MySQL
databases used by the softswitch. Thus, attackers demonstrate a good understanding of
the internal architecture of the targeted platform.
How attackers use stolen information is an as yet unsolved mystery. The call data
records could be used for cyberespionage or for VoIP fraud.

Malicious 3ds MAXScripts Threat Report exclusive
Numerous 3ds Max users affected by two campaigns
leveraging malicious MAXScripts
PhysXPluginStl
In mid-August 2020, Bitdefender [15] reported on a campaign where the first stage was
a malicious 3ds Max encrypted script (MSE) file called “PhysXPluginStl.mse” containing a
malicious DLL. We had a look into it and tweeted [16] our findings.
Autodesk 3ds Max is popular, professional 3D modeling and animation software. An MSE script
is a 3ds MAXScript (MS) that is encrypted using a proprietary encryption algorithm. Two versions of the algorithm are supported, namely version:1 and version:2. The version:1 algorithm
has the advantage of being supported across all versions of 3ds Max and this is the one that
was chosen by the attackers, allowing them to maximize the number of potential victims.
Once decrypted, “PhysXPluginStl.mse” contains a base64-encoded .NET DLL that is loaded
using 3ds Max .NET bindings.

mentioned a new malicious MAXScript called ALC3 that is built to steal 3ds Max models
and propagates to other MAXScript files once saved.
This malicious script first collects various information about its host such as:

• Number of cores
• Amount of RAM
• Disk drive models, sizes and serial numbers
• Ethernet network interface MAC addresses and assigned IP addresses
• Version of 3ds Max used
This info along with the current 3ds Max model is then sent by email to the
rrr888_3000@126[.]com email address with sss777_2000@126[.]com as sender using the
System.Net.Mail .NET API and the smtp.126[.]com SMTP server. This means the attackers
not only have access to the victim’s machine information but also to their 3ds Max
models, potentially stealing valuable intellectual property.
The malware also updates itself from http ://www.maxscript[.]cc/update/upscript.mse
and the updated script is saved under the 3ds Max startup folder so that it is executed
every time 3ds Max is launched.
Recently, we noticed that the maxscript[.]cc domain was no longer under the control of
the attackers, so we sinkholed it. Since no backup C&C mechanism is implemented in the
malware, this prevents the attackers from updating their malware. However, the virus
continues to spread and the data theft continues.
Thanks to this sinkholed domain, we found out that tens of thousands of computers
running 3ds Max were compromised by this script, with more than 90% of the victims
located in China.

Content of the decrypted malicious MAXScript

By looking at our telemetry we found hundreds of victims, predominantly located in
South Korea and Japan. The earliest sighting of this threat goes back to February 2020.
Several of these victims were video game companies, which is not surprising considering
the nature of 3ds Max software.

Latin American banking trojans Threat Report exclusive
ESET has been monitoring Latin American banking trojans for over three
years now and these malware families never stop their evolution. In Q3
2020, ESET researchers observed some significant changes compared to Q2.

due to the threat actors’ lack of fluency in Italian. Furthermore, the email template is
identical to one of those used in Spanish campaigns. Compared to Spain, these campaigns
were very small, so we believe these scammers are currently testing the territory. Is it
possible Italy will be their next major target?

LATAM banking trojans: Eurotrip continues
Grandoreiro [22], Mekotio [12] and Mispadu [23] have been the most active Latin American
banking trojans lately. Since the end of 2019, these three banking trojans expanded
beyond Latin American borders — to Spain and Portugal. Due to the language similarities,
that seemed like a logical step. Unexpectedly, based on ESET’s telemetry from Q3, they
also significantly decreased their activity in their homeland — Brazil.
Compared to Q2, campaigns in Spain doubled while those in Brazil were reduced
enormously. That does not mean Latin America is no longer a target — the region is still
attacked by other Latin American banking trojans, mainly Casbaneiro [24] and Vadokrist.

Spam email template used by Mekotio in Spain

It is not surprising that Latin American banking trojans began targeting Spain
and Portugal — the language similarities make it easier for the operators to
be successful. However, we were surprised by the significantly decreased
activity in Brazil and by the sudden appearance in Italy.

This increasing activity in Europe leads us to a second observation: several spam
campaigns targeting Italy [25] in the last few weeks of Q3. This is surprising; it is the
first time that operators of these malware families utilized a language foreign to Latin
America. These emails are poorly written and some even contain parts in Spanish, likely

Finally, Mekotio became the first Latin American banking trojan to appear in a 64-bit
variant of its binaries. Even though this is a standard approach with malware nowadays,
it has not been used by these malware families before. It only shows their continuous
efforts of improvement.
For more information on this topic, ESET has recently published a white paper [26]
detailing how authors of Latin American banking trojans cooperate closely.

Android threats
Welcome Chat as a secure messaging app? Nothing could
be further from the truth
ESET researchers discovered a new operation within a long-running cyberespionage
campaign in the Middle East, apparently with links to the threat actor group known as
Gaza Hackers, or Molerats.

APT GROUP
ACTIVITY

Instrumental in the operation is an Android app, Welcome Chat, which serves as
spyware while also delivering the promised chat functionality. The malicious website
promoting and distributing the app claims to offer a secure chat platform that is
available on the Google Play store.
Both claims are false: Welcome Chat is an espionage tool, and was never available on
the official Android app store. On top of that, its operators left the data harvested
from their victims freely available on the internet.
On top of its core espionage functionality — monitoring the chat communications
of its users — the Welcome Chat app can perform the following malicious actions:
exfiltrating sent and received SMS messages, call log history, contact list, user
photos, recorded phone calls, the GPS location of the device, and device info.

APT‑C‑23 group evolves its Android spyware
ESET Research uncovered a previously unreported version of Android spyware used by
APT-C-23, a threat group also known as Two-tailed Scorpion and mainly targeting the
Middle East. ESET products detect the malware as Android/SpyC23.A.
Compared to previously documented versions of the threat group’s mobile spyware,
Android/SpyC23.A has extended spying functionality, including reading notifications
from messaging apps, WhatsApp call recording and screen recording, and new stealth
features, such as dismissing notifications from built-in Android security apps.

Highlights from ESET investigations
into Advanced Persistent Threat
groups and their campaigns

One of the ways the spyware is distributed is via a fake Android app store,
impersonating well-known messaging apps, such as Threema and Telegram, as a lure.
After the malware is initialized, victims are requested to manually install the
legitimate app, which is stored in the malware’s resources. While the legitimate app
is being installed, the malware hides its presence on the affected device. Thus, the
victims end up with a functioning app they intended to download and spyware silently
running in the background.

NewPass Threat Report exclusive
NewPass: A tale of two attributions
In June 2020, a previously undocumented piece of malware was uploaded to
VirusTotal from Cyprus. In the following weeks, it was attributed to Turla
and dubbed NewPass by another security company, Telsy. ESET researchers
disagree with the attribution claims and consider NewPass to be currently
unattributed.
We actually became aware of this backdoor in March 2019 while investigating an incident
related to the Dukes (also known as APT29). This incident, documented in ESET’s Operation
Ghost white paper [29] from October 2019, happened in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a
European Union country. During this investigation, several samples of Crutch, a backdoor
operated by Turla, were also found on the very same computers.
The same Cypriot submitter who uploaded NewPass to VT in June 2020 also had uploaded
samples of the Turla Carbon backdoor to VirusTotal in May 2020. We believe that the
current public attribution of NewPass to Turla is mostly based on this pivot.

NewPass technical characteristics
NewPass is a complex backdoor written in C++. We did not notice any code similarity with
known Dukes or Turla malware families.
On disk, there is a loader and an encrypted virtual file system that contains the configuration in JSON format and the backdoor DLL.

As some of the key names in the configuration suggest, NewPass implements two network
protocols: one that uses HTTP and a more complex one that uses image files uploaded to
the Imgur web service.
Using the official Imgur API, NewPass downloads or uploads pictures to the service. It
implements steganography in order to extract information, such as commands, from the
downloaded pictures, and embed exfiltrated data in pictures that are uploaded to Imgur
for later retrieval by the malware operators. In order to blend into normal Imgur activity,
the malware implements a sentence generator that is used to fill the description section
on Imgur.
The second network protocol, based on HTTP, shows interesting similarities with known
Dukes TTPs:

• The servers are controlled by the attackers and the homepage redirects to the website

that is mimicked by the malicious domain (e.g. ugtimes[.]com for the C&C server
utdtimes[.]com). This is similar to PolyglotDuke and FatDuke TTPs.
• In the HTTP reply from the server, the data for the backdoor is between two delimiters.
It’s similar to the network protocol of PolyglotDuke.
Finally, the backdoor implements a wide range of commands allowing its operators full
control of the victim’s machine.
We did not find strong similarities with any Turla malware families. The curious
similarities in the network infrastructure, although interesting, are not enough to
attribute NewPass to the Dukes. Hence, we currently consider this malware family to
be unattributed.

Zebrocy (Sednit) Threat Report exclusive
The Sednit group — aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, and STRONTIUM — has
been operating since at least 2004, and is believed to be behind major,
high-profile attacks. It has a diversified set of malware tools in its arsenal,
including Zebrocy. Zebrocy’s targets include embassies, Ministries of Foreign
Affairs, and diplomats, primarily in Central Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

Zebrocy Nim downloaders still used in Q3 2020
In the previous quarterly report, we described a minor resurgence in Zebrocy deployments
after a period of inactivity. In Q3, the group maintained the low level of activity,
deploying a few new campaigns, according to our telemetry.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 10

In August, a sample that was part of a campaign using the NATO AVT-355 Research Workshop
event as bait was spotted on VirusTotal (filename: AVT_355_Call_for_Participation). Zebrocy’s operator took inspiration from this event [30] to lure their victims and distribute
one of their downloaders written in Nim. This language is not new for the group; the last
campaign involving the Nim downloader was at the end of 2019 and we mentioned it here
[31]. This campaign is similar to their usual modus operandi, a phishing email with an
archive attached. Luring the victim to expect a benign document, the attackers provide
an executable with a PDF icon, but which is actually a malicious downloader leading to a
potential backdoor as the final stage.

Affairs and diplomatic organizations in the last months. It also shows that they no longer
rely only on spearphishing email but also likely exploit unpatched applications running on
their targets’ internet-facing servers.

Gamaredon Group Threat Report exclusive
Gamaredon is a threat group that has been active since at least 2013. It
has been responsible for a number of attacks, mostly against Ukrainian
institutions.

TA410 Threat Report exclusive
TA410 is a state-sponsored group that has been targeting the US utilities
sector since 2019 and was first reported by Proofpoint [32] in August 2019.
Its main TTPs include the sending of spearphishing emails with documents
containing malicious macros and the use of the custom backdoors LookBack
and FlowCloud [33].

TA410 expands its activities
In July 2020, we witnessed suspicious activity in a diplomatic organization in the Middle
East and were able to attribute it to TA410. This targeting appears very different from
what was reported before and might show a shift in the group’s objectives.
The attackers likely exploited an internet-facing server that was running an outdated and
vulnerable version of Microsoft SharePoint. It allowed them to drop malware and take control of the machine. On this machine, the operators deployed various tools and malware:

• A new variant of the LookBack backdoor (also known as SodomNormal), configured to

communicate directly with a hardcoded IP address
• WMIExec [34], a tool used for lateral movement
• Several variants of HTran [35] (also known as HUC Packet Transmitter), a tool used to
proxy network traffic between a compromised machine and the attacker’s server
• A currently undocumented backdoor, stored encrypted in the Windows registry, that
tries to blend into the network traffic by using a forged HTTP “Host” header value,
onedrive.live.com, while connecting to the attacker’s server

Gamaredon — flooding the zone with trojans
The Gamaredon group was highly active during Q3 2020, continuing its relentless targeting
of governmental organizations in Ukraine. Since ESET’s Gamaredon blogpost published in Q2
2020 [36], the group has updated its malware arsenal. In this Threat Report update, we describe the latest efforts made by this group to turn legitimate documents, archives and
executables found in compromised networks into trojan horses.
As introduced in the Q2 2020 blogpost, the office macro injection module and the Outlook
VBA module were designed to help lateral movement within an organization, by compromising legitimate resources. The first automatically injects malicious macros or remote
template references into documents accessible from the compromised system. The second
replaces the default Outlook VBA project with one that automatically builds and sends
malicious emails to selected targets.
The Gamaredon group remained creative and has added three modules to its arsenal, all
further facilitating lateral movement. The first of these is distributed as an SFX archive
containing BAT and VBS files, one of Gamaredon’s favorite tandems. This module creates a
scheduled task that will run every nine minutes, looking for removable or network drives.
When it succeeds, it places a LNK file in the drive’s root directory with a hardcoded name,
such as “FILES.lnk”, in the hope that someone will open it. These LNK files call “mshta.exe”
to download and execute a remote file.

The activity continued in August 2020 with the targeting of an embassy of a country
in West Africa. While the compromise vector is currently unknown, we found a variant
essentially identical to the LookBack backdoor mentioned previously.
These two cases show a shift in TA410 activities with a focus on Ministries of Foreign

VBScript responsible for creating the LNK files
ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 11

The second module is similar to the earlier macro injection module, but with a twist.
Using both BAT and VBS scripts, it injects malicious macros into existing documents,
and it also replaces the Microsoft Word templates “Normal.dotm” and “NormalEmail.dotm”
with one containing a malicious VBA project with autorun code to attach a reference to a
remote template to the active document. As the “Normal.dotm” template opens whenever
you start Word, this means that Word will try to download this remote template whenever
opening a document.

malware on Windows servers and important workstations, and its PHP malware on internal
web servers.
We detected a GreyEnergy sample deployed, as usual, as a Windows service DLL, with the
following configuration:

VBA project code responsible for adding a remote template to the active document

The third module is an SFX archive containing scripts to scan compromised systems (local
and mapped drives) for archives and executables with specific filenames, and modify them.
Examples of executable names it specifically looks for are: *install*, *setup*, *driv*,
*usb*, *word*, *office*, *win*, and *rar*.
This module uses 7z to trojanize archives and executables. For the archives, it simply
adds a malicious VBS downloader, hoping that the victim will run it manually. For the
executables, it creates a valid 7z SFX archive with the same name and containing both the

newly created SFX archive ensures that both are unpacked and run when the SFX is executed.
While these new Gamaredon group tools are not sophisticated, they clearly demonstrate
that this group’s operators are able to come up with creative solutions to further move
laterally into their target networks and create all kinds of headaches for the defenders.

GreyEnergy group Threat Report exclusive
The GreyEnergy group, active since 2015, was identified as a successor
of the BlackEnergy APT group — along with the TeleBots group — by ESET in
2018 [37]. The GreyEnergy group is mostly interested in industrial networks
belonging to various critical infrastructure organizations. In December 2016,
the group deployed a data-wiping worm that ESET researchers believe to have
been a predecessor of NotPetya.

Extracted GreyEnergy configuration (Campaign ID redacted)

As you can see, the A1 value, which represents the GreyEnergy version, is 420 (previous
samples detected in 2018 were at version 336). This suggests that the malware authors
are still developing and improving the GreyEnergy backdoor. The meaning of the remaining
configuration items is described [38] in our white paper on GreyEnergy.

Top 10 malware detections in Q3 2020 (% of malware detections)

ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 13

Top 10 malware detections
VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent trojan Q2 2020: 2 ↑ Q3 2020: 1
This detection typically covers maliciously crafted Microsoft Office files that try to
manipulate potential victims into enabling the execution of malicious macros. Upon
execution, the enclosed malicious macro typically downloads and executes additional
malware. The malicious documents are usually sent as email attachments, disguised as
important information relevant to the recipient.

LNK/Agent trojan Q2 2020: 1 ↓ Q3 2020: 2
LNK/Agent is a detection name for malware utilizing Windows LNK shortcut files to execute
other files on the system. Shortcut files have been gaining popularity among attackers,
as they are typically considered benign and less likely to raise suspicion. LNK/Agent files
don’t contain any payload and are usually parts of other, more complex malware. They are
often used to achieve persistence of the main malicious files on the system or as a part
of the compromise vector.

Win/Exploit.CVE-2017-11882 trojan Q2 2020: 3 ↔ Q2 2020: 3
This detection name stands for specially crafted documents exploiting the CVE-201711882 [39] vulnerability found in the Microsoft Equation Editor, a component of Microsoft
Office. The exploit is publicly available and usually used as the first stage of compromise.
When the user opens the malicious document, the exploit is triggered and its shellcode
executed. Additional malware is then downloaded onto the computer to perform arbitrary
malicious actions.

embedded Packager (and other) objects, or even serve as decoy documents to distract the
recipient while malware is downloaded in the background.

DOC/Fraud trojan Q2 2020: 14 ↑ Q3 2020: 6
DOC/Fraud detections mainly cover Microsoft Word documents with various types of
fraudulent content, distributed via email. The purpose of this threat is to profit from
the victim’s involvement — for example, by persuading victims to disclose online account
credentials or sensitive data. Recipients might be tricked into believing that they have
won a lottery prize or been offered a very favorable loan. The documents often contain
links to websites where victims are asked to fill in personal information.

HTML/Phishing.Agent trojan Q2 2020: 6 ↓ Q3 2020: 7
HTML/Phishing.Agent is a detection name for malicious HTML code often used in a phishing
email’s attachment. When such an attachment is opened, a phishing site is opened in the
web browser, posing as an official banking, payment service or social networking website.
The website requests credentials or other sensitive information, which is then sent to
the attacker.

JS/Agent trojan Q2 2020: 7 ↓ Q3 2020: 8
This detection name covers various malicious JavaScript files. These are often obfuscated
to avoid static detections. They are typically placed onto compromised but otherwise
legitimate websites, with the aim of achieving drive-by compromise of visitors.

HTML/Fraud trojan Q2 2020: 5 ↑ Q3 2020: 4

Win/HackTool.Equation trojan Q2 2020: 8 ↓ Q3 2020: 9

HTML/Fraud detections cover various types of fraudulent, HTML-based content, distributed
with the aim of gaining money or other profit from the victim’s involvement. This includes
scam websites, as well as HMTL-based emails and email attachments. In such an email,
recipients may be tricked into believing they have won a lottery prize and are then
requested to provide personal details. Another common case is the so-called advance fee
scam [40], such as the notorious Nigerian Prince Scam aka “419 scam”.

The detection name Win32/HackTool.Equation covers tools attributed to the United States
National Security Agency (NSA) and made public by the hacking group Shadow Brokers. Soon
after the leak, these tools became widely used by cybercriminals. The detection also includes malware derived from these leaked tools or threats using the same techniques.

DOC/TrojanDownloader.Agent trojan Q2 2020: 4 ↓ Q3 2020: 5

PDF/Fraud detections represent PDF files with various types of fraudulent content,
distributed via email. Similar to DOC/Fraud, the aim of this threat is to profit from the
victim’s involvement, for example by persuading victims to disclose their credentials or
sensitive data. Recipients might be tricked into believing that they have won a lottery
prize or been offered a favorable loan. The documents often contain links to websites
where victims are asked to fill in personal information.

This classification represents malicious Microsoft Word documents that download further
malware from the internet. The documents are often disguised as invoices, forms, legal
documents, or other seemingly important information. They may rely on malicious macros,

Downloaders
Emotet-powered VBA detections dominate the downloader scene, pushing the category out of lethargy.

↑28pp

After two consecutive quarters of decline, downloaders came back strong in Q3, with
almost 55% growth in quantity.
One minor contributor was a Nemucod campaign observed over the first two weeks of
Q3 that was focused mostly on unique clients in Poland, Japan and the Czech Republic.
However, the actual attack attempts reported by these clients suggest that the main
target of the campaign was Japan where the per-client detection rate was close to four
times higher than in Poland and twice as high as in the Czech Republic.
The biggest contributor to downloader growth was VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent. Its
detections already dominated the downloader types ranking in Q2, when they comprised
more than a third of all downloader detections (36%). But Q3 brought a massive 60% jump
in detected VBA files which means that almost two thirds of the detection pie goes to
this detection type (64%).

Proportion of downloader detections per detection type in Q3 2020

Other detection types in the rankings mostly held their positions, albeit with a notably
lower share. The proportion of DOC detections declined from 21% in Q2 to less than 10% in
Q3. A similar pattern was observed in the case of JS detections, which went down from 13%
(Q2) to 7% (Q3), followed by Win detections, which decreased from 11% to less than 6% QoQ.
Finally, VBS downloaders went down from 8% to less than 5%.

Downloader detection trend in Q2 2020-Q3 2020, seven-day moving average

The main driver behind the massive increase of VBA detections was Emotet and its
renewed activity in Q3. This notorious malware strain went quiet early in the year, only to
return in the last days of July after a five-month break. The connection between Emotet
and VBA detections is clearly visible in their detection trends, where both follow an almost identical trajectory.
Emotet’s streak of inactivity wasn’t the first one in the years since it began operation.
In 2019 its operators went AWOL mid-year only to start their systems anew in September, just in time for the pre-Christmas shopping season. This year’s hiatus took a little
longer, beginning in February and returning to activity by the end of July. As Emotet was
shuttered for the first six months of the pandemic, it is hardly surprising that its initial
wave [41] of spam against US organizations in August used a COVID-19-themed message.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 15

VBA downloaders

Emotet operators have also been seen using a new type of template for their attachments
named Red Dawn [43]. These were typically compromised Word documents with a black
Office 365 label on top, claiming that they were created on an iOS device and manipulating victims into enabling malicious macros. On August 25th, Emotet upgraded this template
to a red Office 365 label with the Microsoft logo and abandoned the iOS tactic.

VBA downloader and Emotet detection trends in Q2 2020-Q3 2020, seven-day moving average

While Q3 saw the world still striving towards a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus,
researchers at Binary Defense [42] disclosed information about a “vaccine” they developed
against Emotet. Experts exploited a buffer overflow found in malware’s installation process and created a utility that crashed it, thus preventing a compromise. This utility was
silently distributed via CERTs and the infosec community for 182 days until it was rendered ineffective by Emotet operators, who located and fixed the flaw and resumed their
malicious operation in July 2020.

Emotet’s new “Red Dawn” attachment template (Image source: BleepingComputer.com [44])

What was interesting to observe, after Emotet’s return, was the increased
frequency of updates in the code of the downloader. Before the February—July
break, operators updated the binary once or twice a month. After the pause, the
number of changes has doubled and has also become more regular — detected
circa once a week.

Another recently observed [45] template sported a Windows 10 Mobile logo, which is quite
disadvantageous for the attackers as this operating system was EOLed by Microsoft in
January 2020 and thus may raise suspicion even if received by less-skilled users.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 16

Banking malware
Qbot replaced TrickBot as the go-to payload of Emotet as the volume of banking malware continued to shrink.
Banking malware has been slowly losing steam since early in Q2 and continued the
downward trend in Q3 also. The overall number of detections of banking malware has
declined by circa 16% without any notable peaks or significant drops.
The top 10 has been reshuffled in Q3, yet the most dominant family remains JS/Spy.Banker
— a detection that covers an array of malicious scripts designed to steal victims’ credit
card details and other personal information. Its lead has been only slightly reduced from
63% in Q2 to 59% in Q3. The most vivid newcomer in the top ranks was the Qbot family,
which grew by 108% in Q3. This increase is probably related to Qbot becoming one of the
frequently used payloads of the Emotet downloader.
ESET telemetry confirmed this “rivalry”. Up until the end of Q2, TrickBot kept steady
detection rates with occasional quieter streaks as well as drops and spikes in detections.
However, after Emotet’s July restart [46], its numbers started to head south only to be
surpassed by Qbot mid-August.
TrickBot closed Q3 with a 20% drop in overall detection volume — yet, due to the overall
drop of the category — managed to move up from eighth to sixth position in the top 10
ranking, with Qbot seventh, right on its tail.

Ransomware
Ransomware incident is directly connected to a fatality as new players try to join the crowded scene of “doxing” gangs.
ESET telemetry shows an almost 20% decline in ransomware activity in Q3. This includes
mostly families that are mass-spread via email campaigns and only a very limited number
of targeted attacks misusing poorly configured RDP. The most vivid case spread via email
was documented in France distributing Trojan.MSIL/Filecoder.ABC. Based on publicly available [47] information, the attack has been named JobCrypter; it utilized an executable
“succeeded.exe” and was disguised as a job application or an applicant CV.

Win/Filecoder.WannaCryptor trojan

As for the top 10 families detected by ESET telemetry, Win/Filecoder.WannaCryptor — with
its worm characteristics — led the category with more than 52% of detections. As in past
quarters, these detections — as well as those of Win/Filecoder.GandCrab — were tied to
known hashes that kept spreading in unpatched networks in less developed markets.

families in Q3, particularly due to a Nemucod campaign [48] in Japan in the past quarter.
Public reports also show that Q3 brought a “level-up” in Avaddon’s game as the gang
started doxing victims, publishing their stolen data on a newly launched leak site.

The Maze gang, which pioneered the doxing tactic, ranked twelfth in Q3. If combined with
detections of other affiliates in its “cartel”, LockBit and RagnarLocker, the family moves
up the ranks to ninth position.
An increasing depth of cooperation between the cartel members has been demonstrated
by Maze borrowing [49] RagnarLocker’s stealthy approach and encrypting data of a victim
within a virtual machine. The main difference was that Maze used a much larger Windows 7
virtual machine instead of RagnarLockers’s typical Windows XP.

Its operators have added a new technique to the mix, DDoSing the websites of victims to
force them to resume negotiations.

The Sodinokibi/REvil gang used Q3 to recruit affiliates [50]. To demonstrate profitability
of their ransomware as a service scheme, operators deposited close to a million dollars in
bitcoin to their account — these funds are visible to other members of this underground
forum and can be used to trade illicit services or stolen data.

SunCrypt operators added a new tactic to their extortion arsenal — DDoS of the victim’s website

The observed drop in mass-spread ransomware attacks can be attributed to
increased success of targeted attacks combined with other tactics such as
doxing or DDoS of victims’ websites. Sodinokibi’s deposit of 99BTC to a Russianspeaking dark web forum shows the financial attractiveness of this model.
Igor Kabina, ESET Senior Detection Engineer

Other high-profile players looking for their place in the already crowded ransomware
scene included:

• Conti. This family reportedly replaces Ryuk, a well-known ransomware family often seen

as the final payload following the Emotet and TrickBot compromise chain. Conti uses its
own leak site to publish sensitive stolen information.
• OldGremlin group (using TinyCryptor ransomware). This cybercriminal group has been
described by Group-IB [51] and was identified as the perpetrator behind several
ransomware attacks against companies in Russia and former Soviet countries.
Q3 also brought further proof of technical proficiency of high-profile ransomware actors.
As described in this SenseCy blogpost [52], operators behind CLOP, DoppelPaymer, Maze
cartel, Nephilim, and Sodinokibi were seen exploiting recently published vulnerabilities in
remote access appliances by Citrix and products by Pulse Secure. In some of these cases,
incidents occurred even before the manufacturers had a chance to release patches for
their software/hardware.

Trends of unique clients reporting attack attempts on vulnerabilities known to be abused by high-profile
ransomware families in Q2 2020-Q3 2020, seven-day moving average

CVE-2019-19781 affects Citrix appliances and as these proprietary devices do not run
off-the-shelf security products, exploit attempts against this vulnerability will be
un- or under-documented. The only one of the four flaws that ESET telemetry detected
as “more prominent” among cybercriminals was the Pulse Secure Connect vulnerability,
CVE-2019-11510. Hundreds of unique clients daily reported exploitation attempts against
this vulnerability.
However, all four flaws including CVE-2019-11510 can be considered minor vectors when
compared to the volume of brute-force attacks against RDP or detection numbers seen for
EternalBlue and BlueKeep.
Still, an attack [53] exploiting the patched Citrix vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781) has
been identified in a ransomware attack that has been directly connected to a fatality.
Due to encrypted systems in University Hospital Düsseldorf (UKD) in Germany, a patient
in life-threatening condition had to be redirected to another facility, ultimately causing her death. After law enforcement agents — investigating this case as a homicide [54]
— explained that a hospital had been hit, the gang provided decryption keys. Q3 also witnessed one of the largest ransomware attacks [55] yet when Ryuk encrypted computer
systems at hundreds of US-based locations of Universal Health Services (UHS).

ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 19

Cryptominers
The long-term decline in cryptominer activity leveled off in Q3 2020 as the price of bitcoin soared.
Following a long-term overall decline, cryptominer detections appear to have stabilized
in Q3 2020, with the quarter itself exhibiting a slight upwards trend. While both Q2 and Q1
saw a decline in total detections of at least 20% compared to the previous quarter, this
was only 7% in Q3.
The detection levels were steady in July and August and went up slightly in September,
rising almost to peak Q2 values. The average number of detections in September was
11% higher than the Q3 average and 2% higher than the Q2 average. According to ESET
telemetry, the increase is linked to a variant of the JS/CoinMiner PUA that emerged in
mid-August.
As for the overall stabilization of detections in Q3, this might be connected to developments in bitcoin’s price in the past few months — the price started rising steeply at the
end of July 2020, in August reaching its highest values since 2017. This turn of events is
thought to have been driven [56] by the growth of cryptocurrencies in emerging markets
and — curiously — the coronavirus pandemic.
Cryptominer detections

When considering cryptominers distributed as trojans vs. in PUAs, or those in apps vs. in
the browser, the landscape remained virtually unchanged in Q3, with only a minor increase
in browser miners — also the result of the increase in JS/CoinMiner PUA occurrences.
ESET researchers also uncovered an interesting piece of cryptocurrency-targeting
malware in September 2020, which they named KryptoCibule [57]. This malware is notable
for its multifaceted tactics: it uses the victim’s resources to mine coins, tries to
hijack transactions by replacing wallet addresses in the clipboard, and exfiltrates
cryptocurrency-related files.

A growing bitcoin price means that mining becomes more profitable, which also
attracts cybercriminals. However, despite the slight uptick in miner detections
observed this quarter, it is unlikely this type of threat will make a major
comeback this year.

Spyware & backdoors
Common password stealer Fareit was on the rise in Q3 2020, its distribution driven
by large-scale malspam campaigns.
Spyware and backdoor detections were on a slight downward trend in Q3 2020, declining by
7% and 3% respectively, compared to Q2. Houdrat remained in first place, its prevalence
driven by its invasive spreading mechanism, and poor cyberhygiene in developing markets,
much like in Q2 [58]. Elsewhere on the list, however, there was movement in the rankings,
with Win/Spy.Socelars seeing the largest growth, its detections more than doubling since
the previous quarter. This spyware steals passwords stored in browsers and goes after payment data from the compromised accounts.
Another spyware family seeing a significant uptick in Q3 was Win/PSW.Fareit, a widespread
password-stealing trojan also known as Pony. Fareit is popular among cybercriminals due
to its source code being leaked online, enabling them to employ it in their malicious campaigns. Once present on a system, Fareit steals login information from various browsers
and other credential-storing apps, and then sends the stolen data to a remote server.
According to ESET telemetry, Fareit is distributed primarily via malspam — 92% of Fareit
detections in Q3 were found in email attachments. Most of these attachments were
executables, disguised as documents related to shipping and parcel delivery updates.

The rising prevalence of threats such as Fareit shows that passwords are a

and easily monetized in underground markets. Our telemetry shows that spam —
however overused the lures — is the go-to distribution vector for these threats.

Exploits
Unique clients reporting brute-force RDP attack attempts grew by 37% quarter-over-quarter, while total attack attempts increased by 140%, followed by a
short-lived drop at the end of the quarter.
As the number of people infected by the coronavirus reached new heights in Q3, companies
continued to rely heavily on remote access. This is probably one of the reasons why
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) remains a prime target for cybercriminals in Q3, which was
documented by a 37% QoQ growth of unique clients reporting a brute-force attack attempt
against their RDP connection.
The overall quantity of attack attempts saw extreme growth, adding 140% detections over
the previous quarter. ESET telemetry documented a sharp — yet short-lived — drop at the
end of September, where the number of “guesses” fell by almost 40%.
As this limited decline was observed in multiple regions, it is possible that one of the
following scenarios might have been at play:

Ransomware gangs showed other underground players that compromising RDP
and stealing victims’ sensitive data can be a very profitable attack technique.
This, combined with the growing number of poorly secured systems being
connected to the internet during the pandemic, has fueled the extreme increase
in brute-force attack attempts against RDP as seen in ESET telemetry data.
Jirí Kropác, Head of Threat Detection Labs, ESET

EternalBlue detections saw an uptick in Q3, closing this quarter with a 26% increase in
unique clients being targeted per day. The number of EternalBlue attack attempts followed a very similar trajectory, closing Q3 with an additional 23%.

This contrasted with the 11% drop seen for unique clients who reported attempts to
misuse the BlueKeep vulnerability and 13% drop in the total number of attack attempts
against this flaw.

Mac threats
Mac threats continued to decline throughout Q3 with front-runners losing more than a fifth of their Q2 detection numbers.
Mac threats followed the same path as in Q2 seeing a further gradual decline throughout
Q3. The number of detections decreased by 21% in a quarter-over-quarter comparison.
The largest variability was notable in the case of potentially unwanted applications
(PUAs), with occasional small ups and downs, yet no significant spikes. For all the other
categories such as adware, trojans and Potentially Unsafe Applications (PUsAs), detected
quantities decreased steadily in Q3.
The most frequent threat detected on the Mac platform remained Mackeeper with 26.6%,
which was only slightly less than its former 27.6% in Q2. However, the absolute quantity of
detections followed the trajectory of the whole category and headed south by 29%.

ESET telemetry shows an almost identical trend for the second-ranked OSX/Keygen PUsA,
used for software piracy, which lost 24% in the absolute number of detections. Due to
falling numbers in the whole category, its percentage decline was minimal — ending at
15.2% in Q3 against 15.6% in Q2.

Top 10 Mac threat detections in Q3 2020 (% of Mac threat detections)

The only new player in the leading ten was OSX/MaxOfferDeal adware, which landed in
the sixth position, with 4.1%, pushing out the Q2 tenth-place OSX/Riskware.Meterpreter
application.
In Q3, ESET research discovered websites distributing trojanized and rebranded versions
of otherwise legitimate cryptocurrency trading applications for macOS. The apps were
wrapped with GMERA malware, whose operators were after victims’ information, such as
browser cookies, cryptocurrency wallets, and screengrabs. ESET found four malicious apps
being used this way, named Cointrazer, Cupatrade, Licatrade and Trezarus. For additional
technical info, read our blogpost [59].

Even if the numbers for PUAs on Mac are quite high compared to trojans and
backdoors, our investigation of the latest GMERA malware showed that some
perpetrators are still actively authoring and distributing malware on Macs.

Android threats
While ad-displaying apps continued to dominate the Android threat scene, banking malware detections saw an upswing in Q3 2020.
After a peak in May 2020, Android detections declined in June, rose in July and kept a
relatively steady level throughout August and September. In terms of overall volume of
detections, Q3 saw a 19% decline in comparison with the previous quarter.
The increase in July was connected to growth of the Hidden Apps threat category, which
has dominated the Android threat landscape for three consecutive quarters. This category
covers detections of deceptive apps that hide their icons after installation and flood the
affected device with full-screen ads. They are commonly disguised as attractive games
and various useful utilities.
Android/HiddenApp detections have doubled compared to Q2, and tripled their share in the
top 10 ranking. The Android/Hiddad family rose from second place to first, although its
total detections actually
All decreased by 12%.
HiddenApps

Another category of Android malware that grew in Q3 is banking malware, with its

Android banking malware detection trend in Q2 2020-Q3 2020, seven-day moving average

This was the result of a surge in detections of an Android/TrojanDropper.Agent variant
carrying the Cerberus banking malware, detected as Android/Spy.Cerberus.
Cerberus is a notorious mobile banking trojan that surfaced [60] in June 2019 and was
highly active until July 2020, when the gang behind the malware split up and put the malware up for auction [61]. Not even a month later, on August 11, the Cerberus source code
was released for free [62] on an underground forum, allowing anyone to use the malware
for their own profit — thus boosting the number of detected attack attempts.

Detection trends of selected Android threat categories in Q2 2020-Q3 2020, seven-day moving average

Although banking malware makes up only a tiny fraction of Android threats, its
growth is worrisome, as without adequate protection, it can do serious harm.
A major source code release such as that of Cerberus allows more bad guys to
easily distribute custom payloads — that’s what we also saw in the past with
other banking malware families, such as BankBot, Anubis and Exobot.
Lukáš Štefanko, ESET Malware Researcher
ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 24

Web threats
Web threat blocks were down in Q3 2020, as a result of two large players disappearing from the malicious domain scene.
In the third quarter of 2020, ESET telemetry recorded a 16% overall decline in the key web
threats we track, a continuation of the downward trend observed in Q2. This decline included the categories Scam, Malware, and Phishing; Malware Object was the only category
that grew both in terms of overall blocks and unique URLs blocked.
Malware-serving websites saw the largest quarter-over-quarter decrease — 28%. This
development is connected to the demise of two domains that were at the head of the
Malware category throughout all of H1: adobviewe[.]club and fingahvf[.]top. The former
number one, adobviewe[.]club, is part of an adware scheme, displaying pop-ups promoting
further threats. Detections of this domain were declining gradually during Q2, dropped at
the end of April and were virtually non-existent in Q3.
The fingahvf[.]top domain, which redirects visitors’ browsers to websites distributing
further threats, saw a sharp fall: at the end of May 2020, daily blocks dropped from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands, and declined further throughout Q3.
These declines may be due to the campaigns ending or being moved to different domains
and servers. The domains with the largest numbers of blocks in Q3 are listed below.

Top 10 brands and domain names targeted with homoglyph attacks in Q3 2020

In the area of homoglyph attacks1, we observed a decline in overall domain detections, but
saw some newcomers in terms of impersonated brands and domain names — in fact, the top
two “homoglyphed” domains only surfaced in Q3.
The number one domain, nẹxi[.]com (note the dot below “e”), impersonates Nexi, a popular
digital payment service in Italy. The second most blocked domain (bankline.ỉtau[.]com —
note the hooked rather than dotted “i”) poses as the website of the Brazilian bank Itaú.
The detections of these domains were exclusively from Italy and Brazil, respectively.

Email threats
Detections of malicious emails continued to grow in Q3 2020, with delivery and logistics companies heavily misused as lures.
Total malicious email detections per quarter were up 9% compared to Q2 — maintaining the
growth rate observed between Q1 and Q2. Following peaks in July and August, the activity
declined steeply in September.
The most prevalent threat detected in emails remains Win/Exploit.CVE-2017-11882 —
malicious documents exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to download additional
malware onto the computer. The next most common were HTML/Fraud and DOC/Fraud, with
the latter almost doubling in detections since Q2. Both these detection names cover scam
emails sent with the aim of extracting personal information from the recipients.

compared to Q2. DHL remained the most heavily impersonated brand in these malicious
emails, followed by the South African bank Absa and logistics giant Maersk.

JS/Danger.ScriptAttachment trojan

Phishing emails using DHL as a lure, which skyrocketed in Q2, saw a further, albeit much
smaller, increase this quarter (50%). A more dramatic growth was observed for emails

Top malicious email attachment types2 in Q3 2020

More than 70% of the malicious attachments identified in Q3 2020 were executables,
followed by script files and Office documents. Compared to Q2, executables strengthened
their first-place position with an increase of 18 percentage points; Office files decreased
by 13 points.

Spam email using COVID-19 financial assistance as a lure

Executable attachments were frequently disguised using so-called double file extensions
to trick recipients into opening them, taking advantage of the fact that file extensions
for known file types are hidden by default on Windows. PDF was by far the most heavily
used guise in Q3; attackers also commonly attempted to disguise malicious executables as
Microsoft Excel and Word files, images and archives.
As for detections of spam — unsolicited emails of any kind, not necessarily carrying
malware — these kept a steady level in Q3, with multiple small peaks. The overall volume of
spam detected was up by 4% compared to the previous quarter.
In Q3, we observed spammers still frequently misusing the coronavirus pandemic for their
own profit. One of the most commonly recurring themes in unsolicited emails was financial
support related to the pandemic, as seen in the screenshot on the upper right. Exploiting
the financial struggles faced by many in the crisis, and impersonating legitimate organizations, crooks try to manipulate victims into giving up sensitive information.
When interpreting ESET data on spam, one should take into account that our visibility into
spam traffic is limited, as emails may be filtered at the internet email service provider,
or elsewhere, before reaching ESET’s antispam solution on client machines.

IoT security
Old vulnerabilities in top 10 see a slight decline, “admin” still king among weak usernames and passwords.
Q2
With over 100,000 tested routers, ESET has continued to monitor security developments in
the IoT sphere throughout Q3. As in the previous quarters, thousands of routers remain
vulnerable to using default passwords to enter the administration interface, with only
minor changes in the ranking.
The most often detected weak password — seen on over 4600 devices — remained “admin”,
followed by 500 devices using password “root”, over 200 using “1234” and tens using
“12345”. These are probably default passwords and are most often accompanied by
predefined usernames such as “admin”, “root”, “guest”, “1234” and “support”.

ESET detections suggest that many people run outdated routers with years-old
vulnerabilities. What makes this matter worse is the fact that two out of the
top three flaws are command injections, which are especially dangerous and
are key to the building of IoT botnets.
Milan Fránik, ESET Malware Researcher

The top 10 vulnerabilities saw only minor changes in ranking, and the list of the most
often found CVEs saw no changes at all. While the oldest flaw, CVE-2012-5687, still led
the rankings in Q3, the proportion of devices that were found to suffer from it declined
slightly from 17.7% to 16.3%. Similarly, the routers reported as vulnerable to the command
injection described in CVE-2014-8361 dropped from 13.8% in Q2 to 11% in Q3.
The most notable increase was documented in the case of CVE-2015-7248, which saw 1.4%
more detections than in the previous quarter, moving this vulnerability up from eighth to
fifth position.
Q3 also marked another big find by ESET Smart Home Research — an extended version of
Kr00k — a vulnerability that affected encryption in many popular devices with Broadcom
and Cypress Wi-Fi chips. Our research confirmed that there are encryption issues also in
chips by other vendors, namely Qualcomm and MediaTek. For more details read the featured

MITRE ATT&CK contributions
ESET researchers regularly contribute to MITRE ATT&CK® [73] — a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. Q3 2020 saw several ESET contributions
accepted to the ATT&CK knowledge base:

• 1 new sub-technique in the Enterprise matrix
• 1 extension of an existing sub-technique in the Enterprise matrix
• 1 new contribution to the Software category
• 1 extension within the Software category
• 1 extension within the Groups category
With the next ATT&CK update, these contributions will be listed among the Enterprise
techniques [74] and in the Software [75] and Groups [76] categories.
The first ESET-contributed entry to Software covers PipeMon, a multistage modular
backdoor used by the Winnti Group, first reported by ESET [18] in May 2020. The backdoor
was used by the Winnti Group against several video gaming companies based in South Korea
and Taiwan.
PipeMon’s persistence method built the basis for another contribution: a new
sub-technique of the Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547) [77] technique, named
Print Processors. ESET researchers discovered that the Winnti Group has used the “Print
Processors” registry key to enable its PipeMon backdoor to persist. Adversaries can use
this technique to load malicious code at startup that will persist on system reboot and
execute as SYSTEM.
The ATT&CK Software category will also be extended with new information about InvisiMole
(S0260) [78], modular spyware used in targeted cyberespionage operations in Ukraine and
Russia. ESET researchers first reported on [79] InvisiMole in 2018; two years later, they
published [80] a deep-dive analysis of the group’s toolset and TTPs. The entry update
ESET THREAT REPORT Q3 2020 | 31

based on this new research maps more than 40 additional techniques to InvisiMole. This
research prompted another contribution to the Enterprise matrix: a modification of the
Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Control Panel (T1218.002) [81] sub-technique, based on
behavior observed while analyzing InvisiMole.
The last contribution accepted in Q3 2020 updates the ATT&CK entry for the Gamaredon
Group (G0047) [82], a threat group active since at least 2013 and targeting Ukrainian
institutions. In their recent research [36] into the Gamaredon Group, ESET researchers
mapped the group’s activities to a number of additional techniques, previously not
included in the group’s entry.

MITRE ATT&CK evaluations
ESET is participating in ATT&CK® Evaluations [83] conducted by MITRE ENGENUITY™ in
November 2020. For this evaluation, 65 ATT&CK techniques across 11 ATT&CK tactics are
used. This includes 12 ATT&CK techniques across 7 ATT&CK tactics that are in scope for the
Linux portion of the Carbanak evaluation.
There are some new features that have been introduced in this round, which emulates
attacks by the Carbanak and FIN7 APT groups. An especially important one is the possibility
to evaluate capabilities not only in Detection, but also in the Protection category. ESET is
one of the 18 vendors (of 30 total) who signed up for these extended evaluations. Another
new addition worth mentioning is the side-by-side vendor comparison of evaluated capabilities, which will make it easier to highlight the differences between two selected solutions. This round will also mark the first time Linux endpoint sensors have been included,
with the majority of the emulation round still focused on Windows platforms.

ESET researchers recognized by Microsoft for KrØØk
ESET researchers Miloš Cermák and Martin Kalužník were acknowledged [85] by the
Microsoft Security Response Center for their contribution to the patching of the KrØØk
vulnerability.

Stadeo: A set of scripts released on GitHub to facilitate
the analysis of Stantinko
ESET researchers released Stadeo — a set of scripts that can help fellow threat
researchers and reverse engineers to deobfuscate the code of Stantinko [86] and other
malware. Stantinko is a botnet performing click fraud, ad injection, social network fraud,
password stealing attacks and cryptomining [87]. Stadeo was demonstrated for the first
time at Black Hat USA 2020 and subsequently published for free use [88].
The scripts, written in Python, deal with Stantinko’s unique control-flow-flattening (CFF)
and string obfuscation techniques described in our March 2020 blogpost [89]. Additionally,
they can be utilized for other purposes: for example, we’ve already extended our approach
to support deobfuscating the CFF featured in Emotet — a trojan that steals banking credentials and that downloads additional payloads such as ransomware.
Our deobfuscation methods use IDA [90], which is a standard tool in the industry, and
Miasm [91], an open source framework, providing us with various data-flow analyses, a symbolic execution engine, a dynamic symbolic execution engine and the means to reassemble
modified functions.

Other contributions
KrØØk testing script released on GitHub
With more than five months passed since our public disclosure of the KrØØk vulnerability
[1] — and several proofs-of-concept published by independent researchers — ESET decided
to release the script [84] its researchers have been using to test whether devices are
vulnerable to KrØØk. We have also included tests for the newer variants described here.
This script can be used by researchers or device manufacturers to verify that specific
devices have been patched and are no longer vulnerable.

The threat statistics and trends presented in this report are based on global telemetry
data from ESET. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the data includes threats regardless
of the targeted platform and includes only unique daily detections per device.

Foreword
Roman Kovác, Chief Research Officer

This data was processed with the honest intention to mitigate all known biases, in an
effort to maximize the value of the information provided on the most significant inthe-wild threats.
Further, the data excludes detections of potentially unwanted applications [92],
potentially unsafe applications [93] and adware, except where noted in the more detailed,
platform-specific sections and in the Cryptominers section.
Most of the charts in this report show detection trends rather than provide absolute
numbers. This is because the data can be prone to various misinterpretations, especially
when directly compared to other telemetry data. However, absolute values or orders of
magnitude are provided where deemed beneficial.
