Introduction
• Cloud services abuse is not something new
• “C&C-as-a-Service” presentation at VB in 2015

• This talk focuses on cloud abuse in the context of targeted
attacks that we investigated
• Goals:
• Show different real implementations of cloud abuse
• Find how, as defenders, we can leverage this setup to our advantage

Custom malware infrastructure
• Developed and maintained by threat actor
• Costly
• Domain name(s), server(s) hosting, data storage, bandwidth …

• Time consuming
• Design, implementation and testing of the communication protocol
• Installation and maintenance of the C&C server(s)

Custom malware infrastructure
• Disadvantages
• Easier to monitor/block/sinkhole/seize
• Higher probability of flaws in the communication protocol
• Difficult to assess the reliability in real conditions

• Advantage
• You choose to implement whatever funny idea you like

Cloud malware infrastructure
• Advantages
•
•
•
•
•

Developed, maintained and operated by knowledgeable third party
Cheaper (often free)
API
Higher reliability
Harder to block/monitor/seize

• Disadvantage
• Constrained by the features the cloud services provide

Conclusion
• Abusing cloud service providers is a worldwide trend

• Such services can be used for different purposes:
• To store a reference used by the malware (C&C …)
• To store the stolen data

• To store all the commands and data

• This behavior brings benefits not only to the attackers, but

also to the defenders, and without the need to “hack back”
