Update 12.01.22: The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a joint
advisory on Cuba ransomware, listing this BlackBerry blog as a resource. See Advisory.

Summary
The threat actor known as RomCom is running a series of new attack campaigns that take advantage of
the brand power of SolarWinds, KeePass, and PDF Technologies. The BlackBerry Threat Research and
Intelligence Team uncovered the campaigns while analyzing network artifacts unearthed during our recent
report on RomComRAT, which was targeting Ukrainian military institutions through spoofed versions of
Advanced IP Scanner software.
In our latest discovery, our team found RomCom impersonating the following products in their campaigns:
SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, KeePass Open-Source Password Manager, and PDF
Reader Pro.
While Ukraine still appears to be the primary target of this campaign, we believe some English-speaking
countries are being targeted as well, including the United Kingdom. This is based on the terms of service
(TOS) of two of the malicious websites and the SSL certificates of a newly created command-and-control
(C2).
1/9

Given the geography of the targets and the current geopolitical situation, it's unlikely that the RomCom
RAT threat actor is cybercrime-motivated.

Attack Vector
In preparation for an attack, the RomCom threat actor performs the following simplified scheme: scraping
the original legitimate HTML code from the vendor to spoof, registering a malicious domain similar to the
legitimate one, Trojanizing a legitimate application, uploading a malicious bundle to the decoy website,
deploying targeted phishing emails to the victims, or in some instances, using additional infector vectors,
which we will go into in more detail below.

RomCom Weaponization
RomCom SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor Campaign
Take a look at the two screen shots below to see how the real SolarWinds NPM site and the spoofed site
compare.

The deployment of this attack is through a Trojanized version of the SolarWinds Network Performance
Monitoring (NPM) application. While downloading a free trial from the spoofed SolarWinds site, a
legitimate registration form appears. If filled out, real SolarWinds sales personnel might contact the victim
to follow up on the product trial. That technique misleads the victim into believing that the recently
downloaded and installed application is completely legitimate. Instead, the victim has unknowingly
downloaded a dropper for the malicious RomCom remote access Trojan (RAT).

Figure 3 – Extracted contents of "SolarWinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip"
The “Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe” file contains a digital certificate from “Wechapaisch Consulting &
Construction Limited.” The threat actor previously used the same certificate information in the
“advancedipscanner.msi” file, a detail which we uncovered in our previous investigation into this threat
actor. It is important to note that the legitimate file is digitally signed by “SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC.”
3/9

The “Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe” contains three embedded x64 files in the resource section:
X86 – Contains “c:\users\123\source\repos\ins_asi\win32\release\instlib.pdb,” the same PDB path
we have previously seen in the “setup.exe” files.
X87 – A clean, digitally signed, SolarWinds Orion installer.
X88 – RomCom RAT dropper. This DLL invokes “rundll32.exe” and runs the “fwdTst” export, which
drops x64 RomCom RAT in “C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\winver.dll” location.

KeePass RomCom Campaign
On Nov. 1, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team made another discovery. The RomCom
team created a new attack campaign abusing a popular password keeper called KeePass. When
someone downloads the application from the fake but legitimate-looking KeePass website, the attacker
drops a malicious bundle onto the victim’s machine with the name "KeePass-2.52."

The fake KeePass.org website drops a Trojanized bundle called "KeePass-2.52.zip." Once unpacked, it
contains the following files:

Figure 6 – Contents of the malicious archive
As shown in the screenshot above, two malicious files are contained in the KeePass-2.52.zip file:
Setup.exe – The file that launches the RomCom RAT dropper: PDB
C:\Users\123\source\repos\ins_asi\Win32\Release\setup.pdb
hlpr.dat is a RomCom RAT dropper.
Our team followed the RomCom Netflows and uncovered both spoofed KeePass and PDF Reader Pro
sites in Ukrainian language. Both of these spoofed websites host their terms of service pages on the same
URL and imply the software providers are hosted by UK companies.
href="privacy/uk_privacy.html"
href="privacy/uk_term.html"
href="privacy/uk_disclaimer.html"

Netflow analysis by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team also led to the discovery of a new C2
registered on Oct. 27, utilizing SSL certificates that emulate UK ownership:
Issuer: C=GB, ST=Greater London, L=Harmondsworth, O=British Government, OU=dgtlocean.com,
CN=ca dgtlocean.com/emailAddress=ca(at)mail.com Issuer: C=GB, ST=Greater London, L=London,
O=Government Digital Service, OU=you-supported.com, CN=ca you-supported.com/em
depth=0 C = GB, ST = British, L = Chesterfield, O = Royal Mail Group Ltd, OU = Group1, CN = Group1.A,
emailAddress = server(at)mail.com

Conclusions
The RomCom threat actor is actively deploying new campaigns targeting victims in Ukraine and Englishspeaking targets worldwide. Based on the TOS, it is possible that victims in the United Kingdom are a new
target, while Ukraine continues to be the main focus.
It’s important to note:
The Trojanized bundles that the threat actor built do not indicate the mentioned vendors were
compromised
The legitimate companies are not involved in any attack
The threat actors created fake websites to mimic the real ones
7/9

RomCom RAT, Cuba Ransomware, and Industrial Spy have an apparent connection. Industrial Spy is a
relatively new ransomware group that emerged in April 2022. However, given the targets' geography and
characteristics, combined with the current geopolitical situation, it's unclear if the real motivation of the
RomCom threat actor is purely cybercriminal in nature.
