The US Treasury has initiated a fresh effort to prevent the continued laundering of the
funds stolen from Ronin Bridge on March 29th by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. For
the first time, sanctions have also targeted the Bitcoin mixer Blender.io, which is
designed to obfuscate blockchain transactions.
The sanctions – issued by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) – targeted 45
Bitcoin addresses linked to Blender.io and four new wallets linked to the Lazarus Group.

Lazarus Group
On March 29th, the North Korean cyberhacking organization stole $540 million from a
decentralized protocol allowing users to bridge their assets between Ethereum and the
popular blockchain game Axie Infinity. The heist was the second largest crypto theft of all
time.
As previously identified, the Lazarus Group began laundering its funds through centralized
exchanges and the popular Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash, which announced soon
after that it would be complying with US-based sanctions. It was previously believed that the
Lazarus Group had moved some of the stolen funds into Bitcoin. Today’s sanctioning of
Blender.io appears to confirm this.
Between April 24th and May 4th, the Lazarus Group sent around $273.9 million of Ether to
the four newly-sanctioned addresses. The transactions involved amounts significantly larger
than its previous laundering efforts. The ramping up of laundering efforts in this manner
potentially reflects a growing desperation by the hackers, who were previously targeted with
sanctions by OFAC on the 14th and 22nd of April.
One of the addresses sanctioned today had already managed to send around $37 million
through Tornado Cash prior to the sanctions announcement – leaving just over $236 million
in the sanctioned addresses.

Blender.io
Furthemore, in a continued effort to combat money laundering by the Lazarus Group, today’s
actions mark the first time in which a virtual currency mixer has been sanctioned. According
to an OFAC press release, Blender.io has been used by North Korea to support its money
laundering activities – including the laundering of over $20.5 million connected to the Ronin
hack.
Elliptic’s analysis indicates that Blender.io has also previously been used to launder funds
from Hydra market, a Russian language darknet market which was sanctioned by OFAC
earlier this month.
