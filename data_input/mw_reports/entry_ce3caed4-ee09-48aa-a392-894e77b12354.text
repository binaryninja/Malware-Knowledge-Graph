The UK, Georgia and international partners have exposed the GRU (Russia’s military
intelligence service)’s – Russia’s military intelligence service – responsibility for a number of
significant cyber-attacks against Georgia last year.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)) assesses with
the highest level of probability that on 28 October 2019 the GRU (Russia’s military
intelligence service) carried out large-scale, disruptive cyber-attacks. These were against a
range of Georgian web hosting providers and resulted in websites being defaced, including
sites belonging to the Georgian Government, courts, non-government organisations (NGOs),
media and businesses, and also interrupted the service of several national broadcasters.
These cyber-attacks are part of Russia’s long-running campaign of hostile and destabilising
activity against Georgia. The UK is clear that the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)
conducted these cyber-attacks in an attempt to undermine Georgia’s sovereignty, to sow
discord and disrupt the lives of ordinary Georgian people. The UK remains unwavering in its
support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:

The GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)’s reckless and brazen campaign of
cyber-attacks against Georgia, a sovereign and independent nation, is totally
unacceptable.
The Russian government has a clear choice: continue this aggressive pattern of
behaviour against other countries, or become a responsible partner which respects
international law.
The UK will continue to expose those who conduct reckless cyber-attacks and work
with our allies to counter the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)’s menacing
behaviour.

Background
The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)) assess
that the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service) was almost certainly (95% +)
responsible for defacing websites, cyber-attacks and interruption to TV channels in Georgia
in October 2019.
Find further details on the framework used by the UK government for all source intelligence
assessments, including the probability yardstick.
Given the NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)’s assessment and the broader context,
the UK government has made the judgement that the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence
service) was responsible.
The cyber programme responsible for these disruptions is known in open source variously as
the Sandworm team, BlackEnergy Group, Telebots, and VoodooBear. It is operated by the
GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)’s Main Centre of Special Technologies, often
referred to by the abbreviation “GTsST” or its field post number 74455.
This is the first significant example of the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service) using
cyber-attacks to disrupt or destroy since late 2017. This Unit of the GRU (Russia’s military
intelligence service) was responsible for:
BlackEnergy: December 2015 shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, with 230,000
people losing power for between 1 to 6 hours
Industroyer: December 2016 shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, also known as
CrashOverride. It resulted in a fifth of Kyiv losing power for an hour. It is the first known
malware designed specifically to disrupt electricity grids
NotPetya: June 2017 destructive cyber-attack targeting the Ukrainian financial, energy
and government sectors and affecting other European and Russian businesses

BadRabbit: October 2017 ransomware encrypted hard drives and rendered IT
inoperable. This caused disruption including to the Kyiv metro, Odessa airport, Russia’s
central bank and 2 Russian media outlets
Georgia is a strategic partner to the UK. The UK supports a range of projects in Georgia and
our annual Ministerial-level UK-Georgia Strategic Dialogue provides an important framework
for continuing to develop our strong relationship. The UK was particularly grateful for
Georgia’s firm support following the attack on Salisbury in 2018, including in efforts to
strengthen the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW (Organisation
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons)).
