additional capabilities, including the ability to deliver exploits to endpoints. Talos recently published a
blog about a broad campaign that delivered VPNFilter to small home-office network devices, as well
as network-attached storage devices. As we stated in that post, our research into this threat was,
and is, ongoing. In the wake of that post, we have had a number of partners step forward with
additional information that has assisted us in our work. This post is an update of our findings over
the past week.

information regarding the suspected stage 3 modules. The new module allows the actor to deliver

exploits to endpoints via a man-in-the-middle capability (e.g. they can intercept network traffic and
inject malicious code into it without the user's knowledge). With this new finding, we can confirm
that the threat goes beyond what the actor could do on the network device itself, and extends the
threat into the networks that a compromised network device supports. We provide technical details
on this module, named "ssler" below.
Additionally, we've discovered an additional stage 3 module that provides any stage 2 module that
lacks the kill command the capability to disable the device. When executed, this module specifically
removes traces of the VPNFilter malware from the device and then renders the device unusable.
Analysis of this module, called "dstr," is also provided below.
Finally, we've conducted further research into the stage 3 packet sniffer, including in-depth analysis
of how it looks for Modbus traffic.

Technical details
NEW THIRD-STAGE MODULES

'ssler' (Endpoint exploitation module — JavaScript injection)
The ssler module, which we pronounce as "Esler," provides data exfiltration and JavaScript injection
capabilities by intercepting all traffic passing through the device destined for port 80. This module is
expected to be executed with a parameter list, which determines the module's behavior and which
websites should be targeted. The first positional parameter controls the folder on the device where
stolen data should be stored. The purpose of the other named parameters are as follows:
dst: — Used by the iptables rules created to specify a destination IP address or CIDR
range that the rule should apply to.
src: — Used by the iptables rules created to specify a source IP address or CIDR range
that the rule should apply to.
dump: — Any domain passed in a dump parameter will have all of its HTTP headers
recorded in the reps_*.bin file.
site: — When a domain is provided in the "site" parameter, this domain will have its web
pages targeted for JavaScript injection.
hook: — This parameter determines the URL of the JavaScript file for injection.

The first action taken by the ssler module is to configure the device's iptables to redirect all traffic
destined for port 80 to its local service listening on port 8888. It starts by using the insmod
command to insert three iptables modules into the kernel (ip_tables.ko, iptable_filter.ko,
iptable_nat.ko) and then executes the following shell commands:
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8888 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8888
Example: ./ssler logs src:192.168.201.0/24 dst:10.0.0.0/16
-A PREROUTING -s 192.168.201.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/16 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports
8888
Convert webpages to pdf online w ith PDFmyURL

8888
Note: To ensure that these rules do not get removed, ssler deletes them and then adds them back
approximately every four minutes.
Any outgoing web requests on port 80 are now intercepted by ssler and can be inspected and
manipulated before being sent to the legitimate HTTP service. All HTTP requests are sslstripped.
That is, the following changes are made to requests before being sent to the true HTTP server:
Any instances of the string https:// are replaced with http://, converting requests for
secure HTTP resources to requests for insecure ones so sensitive data such as
credentials can be extracted from them.
If the request contains the header Connection: keep-alive, it is replaced with Connection:
close
If the request contains the header Accept-Encoding with the gzip value, this is converted
to Accept-Encoding: plaintext/none so no responses will be compressed with gzip
(exceptions are made for certain file types, such as images).

If the host is in one of the dump: parameters, the details of the request are saved to the disk for
exfiltration, including the URL, port and all of the request headers. If the host is not in a dump:
parameter, it will only dump requests with an Authorization header or URLs that have credentials in
them. URLs are determined to have credentials if they contain either the string assword= or ass=
and one of the following strings in them:
sername=
ser=
ame=
ogin=
ail=
hone=
session%5Busername
session%5Bpassword
Convert webpages to pdf online w ith PDFmyURL

session[password

Any POST requests to accounts.google.com containing the string signin will also be dumped.
After these modifications are made, a connection to the true HTTP server is made by ssler using
the modified request data over port 80. Ssler receives the response from the HTTP server and
makes the following changes to the response before passing it on to the victim:
A response with an https:// in its Location header value is converted to http://
The following headers are ignored, i.e. not sent to the client:
Alt-Scv
Vary
Content-MD5
content-security-policy
X-FB-Debug
public-key-pins-report-only
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
The entire response is sslstripped — that is, all instances of https:// with \x20http://.
If parameter site: is provided a domain (or part of a domain, e.g. "google"), it will attempt
to inject JavaScript into all Content-Type: text/html or Content-Type: text/javascript
responses. The requirement is that the string <meta name= … > be present and long
enough to fit the string from the hook: parameter. The <meta name= … > tag will be
replaced with <script type="text/javascript" src="[hook value]">. The victim IP combined
with the site is then added to an internal whitelist in ssler and will not be targeted for
injection again until the whitelist is cleared (which occurs every four days).
Each domain that is sslstripped in the responses (e.g. domains found in links) is then added to a list
of stripped domains. Subsequent requests that are intercepted by the ssler module to domains in
this list will occur via HTTPS over port 443, instead of HTTP over port 80. By default, four domains
are on this list, so ssler will always connect to these domains via HTTPS over port 443:
www.google.com, twitter.com, www.facebook.com, or www.youtube.com.

www.google.com, twitter.com, www.facebook.com, or www.youtube.com.
'dstr' (device destruction module)
The dstr modules are used to render an infected device inoperable by deleting files necessary for
normal operation. It deletes all files and folders related to its own operation first before deleting the
rest of the files on the system, possibly in an attempt to hide its presence during a forensic
analysis.
The x86 version of the dstr module was analyzed in-depth. This module first deleted itself from the
disk and then stops the execution of the parent Stage 2 process. It will then search all running
process for ones named vpnfilter, security, and tor and terminate them. Next, it explicitly deletes the
following files and directories:
/var/tmp/client_ca.crt
/var/tmp/client.key
/var/tmp/client.crt
/var/run/vpnfilterm/htpx
/var/run/vpnfilter

/var/run/vpnfilterm/
/var/run/tord/hidden_ssh/
/var/run/tord/
/flash/nova/etc/loader/
/flash/nova/etc/init/

The dstr module clears flash memory by overwriting the bytes of all available /dev/mtdX devices
with a 0xFF byte. Finally, the shell command rm -rf /* is executed to delete the remainder of the file
system and the device is rebooted. At this point, the device will not have any of the files it needs to
operate and fail to boot.
Additional research on the third stage packet sniffer
'ps' (stage 3 packet sniffer)
One of stage 3 packet sniffer module samples we have is the R600VPN MIPS-like (Lexra
architecture) sample. This sample is a packet sniffer that is looking for basic authentication as well
as monitoring ICS traffic, and is specific to the TP-LINK R600-VPN. The malware uses a raw socket
to look for connections to a pre-specified IP address, only looking at TCP packets that are 150 bytes
or larger (note: This is the full packet size, with headers. Depending on the size of the TCP header,

or larger (note: This is the full packet size, with headers. Depending on the size of the TCP header,
the PDU could be approximately 56 to 96 bytes and still meet the criteria to get logged). It has the
ability to view, but not modify, the network traffic. Very significant changes would be required to
implement functionality that could modify traffic.

Packets that are not on port 502, are scanned for BasicAuth, and that information is logged.

Conclusion
Convert webpages to pdf online w ith PDFmyURL

These new discoveries have shown us that the threat from VPNFilter continues to grow. In addition
to the broader threat surface found with additional targeted devices and vendors, the discovery of
the malware's capability to support the exploitation of endpoint devices expands the scope of this
threat beyond the devices themselves, and into the networks those devices support. If successful,
the actor would be able to deploy any desired additional capability into the environment to support
their goals, including rootkits, exfiltration capability and destructive malware.
Talos would like to thank all of the individual researchers, companies and intelligence partners from
around the world who have stepped forward to share information and address this threat. Your
actions have helped us gain a greater understanding of this campaign, and in some cases, have
directly improved the situation. We recognize this is a team sport, and truly appreciate your
assistance.
We will continue to monitor VPNFilter and work with our partners to understand the threat as it
continues to evolve in order to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is
informed.
