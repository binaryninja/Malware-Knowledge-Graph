New Russian-Speaking Forum – A New Place for RaaS?

July 28, 2021

A new Russian-speaking forum called RAMP was launched in July 2021 and received much
attention from researchers and cybercrime actors. The forum emerged at the domain that
previously hosted the Babuk ransomware data leak site and later the Payload.bin leak site.
KELA researched the contents of the new site and assessed its chances to succeed.
*All the forum contents are described based on what KELA observed on RAMP until July 27,
2021, when the access became was restricted.

Background
The Babuk ransomware group came into the spotlight at the beginning of the year 2021 but
the gang said that their attacks have started in October 2020. The group operated as
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), and was publicly hiring affiliates on two major Russianspeaking forums, XSS and Exploit, since March 2021.
One of the gang’s most notable attacks was carried out against Washington DC’s
Metropolitan Police Department that took place in April 2021. The gang said they had
compromised the DC Police’s networks and stolen 250 GB of unencrypted files. Some of
them were published on their site.

Shortly after the attack, the chaos surrounding the Babuk RaaS closure started. First, the
gang stated it is closing the operation and promised to publish the source code of its
malware to enable other threat actors to create their own ransomware. Then, the Babuk
ransomware developers deleted the post and published a new announcement claiming they
plan to continue breaching companies but instead of stealing sensitive files and encrypting
local data, the group plans only to steal it. However, that second announcement was also
deleted. On May 15, 2021, the Babuk representative stated on one of the forums that their
RaaS affiliate program was closed.

Babuk announcements of coming changes of their leak site and RaaS

On June 1, 2021, KELA observed several changes in the content and appearance of the
Babuk site. The domain used by Babuk showed a page titled “Payload.bin” with the following
message on the front page: “Welcome to Leaks site created by Payload.bin.” It appeared
that this Payload.bin site was the promised site for leaking the stolen data.
However, only one victim was listed on the site – Polish game developer CD Projekt Red.
Interestingly enough, the company fell victim to HelloKitty ransomware in February 2021.
Then, the data allegedly stolen during the attack was traded on an auction on the cybercrime
forum Exploit. The sellers claimed the data was sold outside of the forum. Interestingly, one
of the RAMP users asked about the origins of this leak being posted on Payload.bin. The
admin claimed the Babuk gang did not attack the company and they just provided a place for
the leak: “The Babuk team never had anything to do with this project, we were just asked to
post it, so I provided the material as it is.”

The leak of CD Projekt’s data on Payload.bin and an explanation of this leak on RAMP

On June 27, 2021, a builder (source code) for the Babuk ransomware was uploaded to
VirusTotal. This builder could be used to create custom versions of the Babuk ransomware
and generate decrypters. Researchers speculated the code could be leaked by former
members of the groups or rivals.
On July 1, 2021, it became known that Babuk launched a new leak site stating the operation
continues under the name Babuk 2.0. The gang claimed the old version of Babuk
ransomware was leaked, while the new version is being used in ongoing attacks.
On July 12, 2021, KELA noticed that the former Babuk ransomware gang’s leak site had
changed again and was now hosting a forum named RAMP. A new admin initially named
TetyaSluha (now Orange) announced it is now a place where ransomware affiliates can be
protected from unscrupulous RaaS programs. The admin claimed that following the
ransomware ban on other forums, he wanted to create a new community. The name of the
new forum is a reference to the now-defunct Russian Anonymous Marketplace (a drug
market that closed in 2017). So the big question comes down to: What’s in this
“marketplace”?

The Admin’s Connections to Babuk
The fact that the RAMP site is hosted on the same domain that once was Babuk’s leak site
and then Payload.bin hints that the administrator is somehow related to Babuk. On May 13,
2021, in the post promising to leak the data of Washington DC’s Metropolitan Police
Department, the author stated: “I handed over the source code to another team, which will
continue to develop the product under a different brand, I remain the only owner of the
domain and blog, my service will continue to develop.” It seems that the post author is the
future admin of Payload.bin and RAMP.

When announcing the forum’s opening, the admin stated: “[If you want to know – KELA] who
I am you can search online for the babuk key.” The mention of “Babuk key” probably meant
the builder leak mentioned above. In addition, the admin said: “All this activity that grew into
the RAMP forum is the result of my year’-long work in the field and the competent
manipulation of journalists from top outlets, such as Bloomberg, and so on. I promoted this
domain through blood and sweat.” This again implies that the admin was involved in the
Babuk operation from the beginning.

Moreover, when sharing the Babuk builder on RAMP, the admin claimed: “A guy who made
Babuk for me just took the Darkside ESX locker and reversed it. I can’t tell if there is a
problem with the ESX [version] because I’ve used it only for three companies.” From this and
other posts sharing insights on how to attack the company’s network, we can suggest that
the admin was conducting ransomware attacks by himself.
The admin said that now he is not affiliated with the gang and even stated: “I recommend to
blacklist this product to all security firms and data security [specialists].”

RAMP Forum’s Contents
The new forum is Russian-speaking and named RAMP in honor of the now-defunct Russian
drug marketplace, but its purpose is far away from selling drugs. The admin who renamed
himself to Orange (the old RAMP’s admin’s handle) claimed the forum will be a community
for various cybercriminals, including ransomware developers and affiliates recently banned
on XSS and Exploit. He stated the forum’s full name is “Ransom Anon Mark Place.”
Rules of the forum stated that members are prohibited from attacking Russia and CIS
countries (which is common for such forums), using multiple accounts, spamming, and
performing some other actions. Curiously, the moderators claimed it is prohibited to
propagate “different actions going against Criminal Code of RF [Russian Federation].”

RAMP rules

The forum has multiple sections typical for such cybercrime forums, with a general notice
“welcoming” both RaaS and other services. Two sections that attract a particular interest are
called “Vendor” and “Affiliate Programs” – they are intended for “people and services in
which we [administration – KELA] and our community trust.” As such, KELA observed a
thread dedicated to the LockBit 2.0 affiliate program thread. In the thread, a user named
LockBit (most likely the gang’s representative) claimed he will launch the LockBit 2.0
ransomware ESXi version soon.

LockBit 2.0 thread on RAMP

Since Initial Access Brokers’ services are on the rise, the forum offers a section for access
listings. Moreover, in honor of the forum’s launch, some accesses through Fortinet VPN were
offered for free. The access listings seem to be unique; the forum moderators promised to
change them periodically to avoid multiple targeting.
The forum also has a section “Tools” for selling/sharing exploits and malware, though its
contents so far do not seem to be unique. Interestingly, the Babuk builder was shared again
in this section by the admin who specified that the builder works fine for
encrypting/decrypting files on Windows computers. He mentioned that the VMware ESXi
version does not enable users to decrypt files.
Other sections are intended for sharing articles about hacking, chatting, and discussing the
forum.

The Spam Incident and the Building of the Forum
The site, built on the FluxBB engine, experienced a spam attack. On July 23, 2021, a threat
actor created a thread where he demanded a 5,000 USD ransom to avoid spamming.
Apparently, the admin didn’t pay the ransom and over a few coming days, multiple users
were posting porn GIFs in all sections and threads in the forum. Following the incident, many
users were deleted from the forum. The admin (who previously looked for someone capable
8/10

of auditing the forum’s security for 2,000 USD) stated the forum will be relaunched using a
new engine built from scratch. First, the admin “cleaned” the forum and deleted most of the
users. On July 27, 2021, he restricted access to the forum.

Forum’s Perspectives
The forum seemed to attract some interest from members of other cybercrime forums: KELA
observed several users registered with the same handles as on two major Russian-speaking
forums. Due to the “cleaning” of the forum, on July 26, 2021, the number of users was 59
who seem to be the users that somehow participated in the forum discussion. During the first
ten days of its existence and before the wave of spammers the number of registered users
was around 350. The number of published posts was above 100.
This pace was impressive, however, after the spam incident and deleting of the users it will
definitely slow down. The registration is now closed. According to a message now appearing
on the homepage, on August 13, 2021, the forum will be relaunched and registration will
become available based on certain conditions. Those include users registered on XSS and
Exploit for more than 2 months, with more than 10 messages on a forum and a positive
reputation. An alternative option is to pay a registration fee of 500 USD, which seems to be
exaggerated compared to other forums. For example, a premium user on XSS costs 120
USD for a year. Moreover, Russian cybercriminals are not used to paying money for
registration on forums, especially such a (relatively) big sum.
Once the forum will be relaunched, it is possible that cybercrime actors tired of the
ransomware ban will try it out. So far, the welcoming of the RaaS programs and their
affiliates is the only competitive advantage of RAMP. It seems it is the only factor that can
attract users from other well-established forums. As for the demand of ransomware groups
for Initial Access Brokers, intrusion specialists, and other partners, they can still find them on
existing forums.

The success of the forum also depends on the interest of ransomware groups in publicly
recruiting affiliates again. Some players (like Avaddon and REvil) closed their RaaS or
disappeared from the public space. However, there are new groups that can use a new
community to promote their RaaS. If the admins can leverage their competitive advantage of
welcoming RaaS programs, chances to grow are fairly high.
