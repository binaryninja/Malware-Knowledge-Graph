üì£ Some notes

AFTER THE BUILD U CAN DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY
EXCEPT THE EXE FILE!
I created this project for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and
damage; I started this project because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and
possible exploits. Meanwhile, I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago), but not
long ago, I continued this project, and this is the final result; of course, I will update it and add
more features in the future, but mean-while remember to use your power for good
. If you
liked it, consider
this project and
(follow) me

To be protected against token grabbers, you are more than welcome to install my Anti-TokenGrabber, which is located on my GitHub. [I will upload it later; meanwhile, try
https://github.com/andro2157/DiscordTokenProtector although this grabber is bypassing it,
other grabbers are not]
