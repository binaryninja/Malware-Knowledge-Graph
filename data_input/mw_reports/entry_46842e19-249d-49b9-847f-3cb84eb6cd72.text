Termination of Federal Unemployment Programs
Represents Turning Point for Fraudsters

Since early 2020, Recorded Future has continued to witness prominent changes within
underground communities in response to COVID-19 including an interest in defrauding
government entities via fraudulent unemployment benefit applications. As detailed in our
general reporting on the threat landscape of unemployment fraud earlier this year, criminals
continued to use a variety of methods with relative ease, contributing to a growing
marketplace that saw topics such as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) appear as
a sub-category within underground marketplaces that offered fraudulent tutorials or methods
for aspiring criminals. In addition to these tutorials, we occasionally observed the sale of
compromised account information that came bundled with tutorials on how to best profit off
the stolen information. This past month, however, has served as a critical turning point for
this general landscape with The CARES Act and other federal programs that provided
unemployment benefits for many claimants having expired the week of September 4, 2021.
The federal PUA program provided unemployment benefits to individuals not eligible for
regular unemployment compensation or extended benefits, including those who have
exhausted all rights to such benefits. Recorded Future analysts have monitored for changes
since September 4 and noted the following:
Despite the termination of federal programs, references to PUA guides and methods
continue to persist. It is certainly possible that this is either a combination of ignorance
on the part of some criminal entities who were initially unaware that the federal
programs had ended or were attempts to scam other criminals operating on these
sources for a quick profit.
Although the PUA program expired in September 2021, the methods used by the
actors to brute force accounts on these government websites, combined with the
relative ease with which actors can steal funds intended for US citizens, indicate that
similar government assistance programs may be targeted in the future.

Fraudsters are attempting to use their alleged experience in orchestrating PUA fraud
schemes to demonstrate their ability to perform other forms of fraud that are likely to
persist, such as those targeting other government assistance or loan programs. Some
actors have implied they intend to shift their targeting to other programs that have
proven reliable throughout the pandemic such as those targeting US Small Business
Administration (SBA) relief efforts.
Recorded Future has continued to observe criminal marketplaces that specialize in the
sale of stolen credentials routinely reference pandemic unemployment platform login
information for sale at low cost. The exposure of this login information for individual
account balances is still relevant even after the termination of federal programs for
individuals who have remaining relief balances or fail to maintain proper security
hygiene by reusing the same password across multiple platforms. Other effects of a
victim logging into an account whose login information was compromised may enable
actors responsible for the compromise to steal additional personally identifiable
information (PII), including bank account information.

Some actors have been very frank in their description of what the future of PUA fraud holds
within closed access sources, leaving comments such as: “Pua is dead already, just like the
sba, now only loans work”. However, other actors have continued to promote the sale of
methods or tutorials both before and after the September federal deadline, clearly noting that
some methods are very unlikely to be as profitable once the programs were terminated. In
some advertisements actors appear to be unperturbed by the termination of the programs,
advertising “NEW” working methods for multiple states. The methods used by the actors, as
well as the underlying vulnerabilities in the platforms used by certain states’ PUA websites,
can likely be replicated for broader targeting. In some observed scenarios, threat actors
specifically stated they had acquired stolen login credentials for PUA accounts through
routine attack vectors such as brute-force attacks.

Cybercriminals used brute-forced login credentials and stolen personally identifiable
information (PII) bundled as packages of ‘fullz’ (sets of data on individuals that typically
includes full names, Social Security Numbers, addresses, account numbers, and birthdays)
to compromise victims’ PUA accounts. More broadly, actors have also continued to sell
methods in which criminals can access unemployment relief balances for certain states.
However, prior analysis of several PUA tutorials by Recorded Future’s Gemini Advisory
confirmed that these actors have occasionally expressed doubts about some methods’
viability due to factors such as a large number of potential victims possibly having already
submitted a claim for payment through PUA or other actors may have already attempted to
brute force the account password.

Regardless of the status of these now-defunct federal programs, the effect that the scale of
stolen PII or login credentials from unemployment platforms has had on the criminal
underground is also likely to persist. Recorded Future has continued to observe more
automated criminal marketplaces that specialize in the sale of stolen credentials routinely
referencing pandemic unemployment platform login information for sale at low cost. The
exposure of this login information for individual account balances is still relevant even after
the termination of federal programs for individuals who have remaining balances or fail to
maintain proper security hygiene by reusing the same password across multiple platforms.
The average cost of listings from shops such as the one below doesn’t exceed $10,
representing the ease to which actors who are either unable to have no desire to learn about
PUA-specific methods, such as brute forcing, can instead opt to outright purchase login
credentials to perform unauthorized actions within a victim’s account.

The visual in Figure 1 provides an example of other forms of fraud that are likely to continue
to be of interest in the near future to criminals already beginning to adapt to the transition
that the closure of the PUA federal program has brought. We anticipate that criminals will
continue to target PUA account balances that are still in the process of filing claims even
after the federal deadline due to exceptions that may have been granted to individuals who
had their claims frozen or put on indefinite hold. This was a relatively common event over the
past year given the massive volume of PUA claims placed into a backlog status by state
governments who had to contend with the task of sorting fictitious claims from legitimate
ones. More broadly, although the PUA program expired in September 2021, the methods
used by the actors to brute force accounts on these government websites, combined with the
relative ease with which actors can steal funds intended for US citizens, indicate that similar
government assistance programs may be targeted in the future. Figure 4 below shows the
overall fluctuation in mentions of either “PUA'' or “SBA” within underground sources
monitored by Recorded Future, with the volume of posts closely mirroring one another given
how intertwined promotions for these services are within the same posting. Another point of
consideration is the sudden uptick in discussion within several threads even after the
termination of the federal programs for both topic areas.
