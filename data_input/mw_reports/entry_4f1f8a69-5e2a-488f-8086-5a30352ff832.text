Enlarge / South Korea is deploying Lockheed Martin's THAAD missile defense system, and
that's sparked the ire of the Chinese government, as well as military and "hacktivist" hacking
groups, according to FireEye.

Chinese government officials have been very vocal in their opposition to the deployment of
the Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, raising concerns
that the anti-ballistic missile system's sensitive radar sensors could be used for espionage.
And according to researchers at the information security firm FireEye, Chinese hackers have
transformed objection to action by targeting South Korean military, government, and defense
industry networks with an increasing number of cyberattacks. Those attacks included a
denial of service attack against the website of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
which the South Korean government says originated from China.
FireEye's director of cyber-espionage analysis John Hultquist told the Wall Street
Journal that FireEye had detected a surge in attacks against South Korean targets from
China since February, when South Korea announced it would deploy THAAD in response to
North Korean missile tests. The espionage attempts have focused on organizations
associated with the THAAD deployment. They have included "spear-phishing" e-mails

carrying attachments loaded with malware along with "watering hole" attacks that put exploit
code to download malware onto websites frequented by military, government, and defense
industry officials.
FireEye claims to have found evidence that the attacks were staged by two groups
connected to the Chinese military. One, dubbed Tonto Team by FireEye, operates from the
same region of China as previous North Korean hacking operations. The other is known
among threat researchers as APT10, or "Stone Panda"—the same group believed to be
behind recent espionage efforts against US companies lobbying the Trump administration on
global trade. These groups have also been joined in attacks by two "patriotic hacking" groups
not directly tied to the Chinese government, Hultquist told the Journal—including one calling
itself "Denounce Lotte Group" targeting the South Korean conglomerate Lotte. Lotte made
the THAAD deployment possible through a land swap with the South Korean government.
