Digitally Signed Malware Targeting Gaming Companies

The BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research Team

The Cylance SPEAR™ team has been working diligently to identify and track relationships between
malware using stolen Authenticode code-signing certificates and common command and control (C2)
infrastructure. The PassCV group continues to be one of the most successful and active threat groups
that leverage a wide array of stolen Authenticode-signing certificates.
Snorre Fagerland of Blue Coat Systems first coined the term PassCV in a blog post. His post provides
a good introduction to the group and covers some of the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing
certificate reuse, and other connections associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues
alluding to the possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates, but
at this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being perpetrated by a single group
employing multiple publicly available Remote Administration Tools (RATs).
The PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already started to expand their
malware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen
previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to
companies and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States and
Russia.
In this post we expand the usage of the term 'PassCV' to encompass the malware mentioned in the
Blue Coat Systems report, as well as the APT group behind the larger C2 infrastructure and stolen
Authenticode certificates. We’d like to share some of our findings as they pertain to the stolen
certificates, command and control infrastructure, and some of the newer custom RATs they’ve begun
development on.

PassCV Background
The PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some custom code, which
ultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems via phony resumes and curriculum vitae
(CVs). PassCV continues to maintain a heavy reliance on obfuscated and signed versions of older
1/26

RATs like ZxShell and Ghost RAT, which have remained a favorite of the wider Chinese criminal
community since their initial public release.
SPEAR identified recent PassCV samples which implemented another commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
RAT called Netwire. This tool offers the attacker full control of the victim/host and is perhaps best
known for its cross-platform compatibility, which includes support for Windows, Linux, OSX, and Solaris.
Overall, the antivirus (AV) industry has barely kept pace with the PassCV group, and although some
samples and families are well detected, the majority of the signed samples continue to have extremely
low detection rates.
SPEAR was able to identify several other distinct malware families that we believe to be related to the
PassCV group based upon common stolen Authenticode certificates. The Kitkiot and Sabresac (also
known as Saber or Excalibur based upon strings in the binaries) malware families were deployed by the
group for distinct purposes.
Saber is a custom RAT that periodically queries a web-based C2 server for commands. The only active
instances SPEAR was able to identify were hosted on the Chinese code development site
'csdn(dot)net'. Kitkiot variants are commonly installed alongside other types of malware and often
included additional functionality, including:

Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) capabilities
The ability to hijack and steal in-game account information and items from multiple online gaming
platforms
In some rare cases these were used for click-through advertising fraud.

The Saber Family
The Saber malware utilizes a custom base64 alphabet for decoding messages from its C2 servers. The
malware will decode an obfuscated string found on the site it has been programmed to contact. It will
then communicate to the actual C2 for further instructions to execute. SPEAR only observed samples
that employed clear-text communication between the victim and the actual C2. The malware accepts
any windows shell command the attackers pass back via the C2.
To start the C2 process, Saber samples commonly used blogs on the Chinese-based information
technology and development website ‘blog.csdn[dot]net’. The malware executes an HTTP GET request
to one or more blog page(s). The malware then looks for the string format 'saberstart.
<encoded_string>.saberend' in the response data once the link is retrieved. The data stored between
the strings 'saberstart.' and '.saberend' is encoded with a custom Base64 alphabet which contains a
follow-on C2 address and a port separated with an uppercase 'W'.
SPEAR developed the following Python snippet to aid in decoding the Saber C2 messages:

The exact URLs varied among samples, but SPEAR was able to identify the
following C2 URLs:

SPEAR was able to successfully emulate the remote C2 server, and during testing we were able to
send and remotely execute any command on the (hypothetical) victim system.

Saber Relationships
4/26

While researching the Saber family we found a similar .PDB file path in several samples:
"F:\\Excalibur\\Excalibur\\Excalibur\\bin\\oSaberSvc.pdb"
"D:\\Excalibur\\Excalibur\\Excalibur\\bin\\oSaberSvc.pdb"
"F:\\Excalibur\\Excalibur\\Excalibur\\bin\\Shell.pdb"
The malware author originally employed the username ‘Excalibur_C’ (similar to the .PDB file paths)
when creating the C2 page:
‘http://blog.csdn[dot]net/u013761036/article/details/45542243’
This was the earliest post that SPEAR was able to identify that contained the encoded Saber
commands, with a post date of 2015-05-06 22:20. The same author made numerous other
programming related posts in addition to this page:

Figure 2: Excalibur Blog Posts
Since the time we first started working on this write-up, the Saber author has presumably gained some
additional attention and it seems the username and icon on the blog were changed as a result:

7/26

Fig4-PassCV.png

8/26

Figure 3: Excalibur's New Username
SPEAR also identified a newer variant during our investigation and subsequent write-up. The compile
timestamp indicated that the sample was compiled on August 3, 2016. The newer variant leveraged two
different domains:
‘d26yaxxlnmhaem(dot)cloudfront.net’
‘d1wmnlsnh8rftl(dot)cloudfront.net’
The variant also downloaded additional 7-Zip self-extracting archives that ultimately installed the Saber
malware onto the infected system. Several other signed variants have also been distributed from the
domain:
‘dhd29up7zcdyt(dot)cloudfront.net’
‘Cloudfront.net’ belongs to Amazon’s content delivery network, Amazon CloudFront. This recent move
could indicate the attackers are looking for a more robust means of distribution to continue spreading
their malware.

The Kitkiot family
Kitkiot malware has been publicly linked to the ‘dns-syn[dot]com’ domain which has direct ties to the
group courtesy of Blue Coat Systems’ research. Kitkiot provides backdoor functionality and is
commonly installed alongside other types of malware. It has previously been documented and used to
perform DDoS attacks, function as a proxy server and perform click-through advertising fraud. We
found numerous instances in which Kitkiot variants were written specifically to target online gaming
platforms and modify values stored in databases and other online network communications.
Existing public information about this malware family is available via these links:

http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Kitkiot.A/description

Stolen Certificates and Relationships to PassCV
SPEAR identified roughly eighteen previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates.
Interestingly, not all of the certificates were stolen from game companies. It appeared the group had
also started to branch out into signed adware. This may seem odd at first, but most security
researchers are somewhat numb to the consistent barrage of so-called legitimately signed adware, so a
more advanced backdoor signed with the same certificate could easily be overlooked.
The first new connection SPEAR identified was derived from an email address listed in Blue Coat
Systems' original report on PassCV. The email address ‘13581641274(at)163.com’ which was used to
register the domain ‘aresgame[dot]info’ was reused in 2015 to register the domains
‘fengzigame[dot]net’ and ‘roboscan[dot]net’. Both domains were designed to look like their legitimate
counterparts, ‘fengzigame.com’ and ‘roboscan.com’.
SPEAR found several NetWire variants that communicated to subdomains off of the aforementioned
domains, and identified another larger cluster of activity that was specifically targeted at game
developers using similar variants. All of the variants communicated to domains that were
9/26

extremely similar to other popular gaming framework websites, and contained code to harvest
stored password information as well as log keystroke data.
The C2 domain ‘cocoss2d[dot]com’ mimicked the original website for the Cocos2d gaming framework,
‘http://cocos2d.org/’, used in popular mobile games such as Badland. The C2 domain
‘unitys3d[dot]com’ was designed to impersonate the website of the Unity engine, ‘https://unity3d.com/’,
a gaming engine licensed across multiple gaming platforms and more recently in popular mobile games
like Pokémon Go.
Many of the identified samples also contained a common unique mutex, ‘{332222A-33A3-2222-AAAA3A22AA333}’, which allowed SPEAR to identify a number of additional compromised certificates.
One of the samples identified through this method was:
95a33b0c5f2408adabbebeba6f4c618ba2b392f9dbcd1d9a9ff9db5a519380d8
This led to the discovery of another sample:
ad2a42e4024a320ce763524e17ef7262add649651e2a277b5fc56a9bdc44e449
It was signed with a certificate belonging to AmazGame, a Beijing-based gaming company. The sample
also contacted the domain ‘waw.css2[dot]com’, intended to mimic another domain related to the
Cascading Style Sheets 2.0 specification:

Thumbprint: 59EE1A00910451130BB22E06DEB5DCAF1AFAA282
Serial Number: 7E 12 57 33 28 AD F4 5B 6F 3E C3 41 E6 46 29 3A
Syncopate is a well-known Russian company that is best known as the developer and operator of the
‘GameNet’ platform. GameNet was first identified as being a likely victim of the Winnti group here,
although no associated code-signing certificates were identified at that time. Similarly, in that same blog
post ‘Zemi Interactive’ was also identified as being a likely victim from the same attacks. The evidence
presented above strengthens the claim that the Winnti and PassCV groups are closely related.
During the course of this investigation, SPEAR also identified that NHN’s (Naver Corporation) codesigning certificates were compromised, but it appeared to be related to a substantially different attack
set that SPEAR hopes to shed some light on in the near future.
Blue Coat Systems originally identified additional connections based upon domain registrant
information with the email addresses ‘huise123(at)yahoo.com’ and ‘rebot(at)126.com’. It is possible that
the original stolen code-signing certificates were shared among multiple groups and only more recently
deployed by the attackers. However, SPEAR has not found any significant evidence to support this
hypothesis.
SPEAR identified another sample:
dff0fee3bef9fa2c9c08a6d2c5772e51c1d29522de19301fb389b310e481713f
It was signed using the Beijing AmazGame certificate. The sample beaconed back to the domain
‘task.dns-syn[dot]com’. ‘bot[dot]dns-syn[dot]com’ was previously documented in Blue Coat Systems’
write-up as being registered using the email address ‘rebot(at)126.com’. This email address was
subsequently linked to the domain ‘timewalk[dot]me’, which was documented in other RATs associated
with the Winnti group.
This particular subdomain served a unique purpose, which was to provide additional tasking and to
instruct the malware to target a specific online gaming platform. In the case of this particular sample,
the targeted gaming platform was 'http://20012.com/'. After analysis of several other similar signed
samples, SPEAR found they were all targeted at various individual online and mobile gaming platforms.
SPEAR was able to identify additional samples that utilized these stolen Authenticode certificates,
which created an interesting pivot point and led to the discovery of several additional compromised
certificates.

Conclusion
14/26

The PassCV group continues to be extremely effective in compromising both small and large game
companies and surreptitiously using their code-signing certificates to infect an even larger swath of
organizations. Since the last report, the group has significantly expanded its targets to include
victims in the United States, Taiwan, China and Russia.
SPEAR researchers were surprised to find that a good portion of the old infrastructure exposed by Blue
Coat Systems remains active to this day. However, it was also apparent that the attackers paid attention
to the news, as they let several of the exposed domains lapse and registered extremely similar domains
shortly thereafter. The overall operational security of the group has also improved and more recent
domains were registered using private WHOIS services and other previously undisclosed email
addresses.
Interestingly, most of the malicious binaries were countersigned, which allowed the expired certificates
to continue to be valid long past their expiration date. SPEAR has time and time again observed that
this particular “feature” of Microsoft Authenticode Certificates is easily and readily abused by
malicious actors. Even some recent academic papers pointed out that the binary’s Authenticode
certificate will continue to be valid if a malicious binary is time stamped (countersigned), validly signed
and the certificate is subsequently revoked. SPEAR has not identified any samples related to the
PassCV group that would support the author of the paper’s conclusion, but samples of this nature
would indicate that Authenticode signing is indeed rather broken.
While the motivations of the attackers aren’t entirely clear, SPEAR believes that the attackers
are most likely profiting financially in some way. This could include subverting the in-game
economies of the companies they compromise, reselling the stolen code-signing certificates,
offering malware signing services or by creating their own private VPN infrastructure from
machines within the compromised organizations.
SPEAR identified one binary in particular that fueled this speculation:
8748c19ec86011a77e313e0ea9dd9d0315eed274288585f3663f57e5b8960bdf
The binary was signed with the stolen code-signing certificate from Beijing ‘AmazGame’ and was
named ‘Proxy.exe’. The file communicated with a website ‘www.proxy456(dot)com’, registered using the
email-address ‘plus3k(at)gmail.com’. This email address was previously used to register the following
C2 domains used by the PassCV group from 2012 to 2014:
‘1songjiang[dot]info’
‘dns-syn[dot]com’
‘0pengl[dot]com’
‘0penssl[dot]com’
‘2likui[dot]info’
‘3wusong[dot]info’
Proxy456 claims based on a rough translation to be “China’s first integrated cloud proxy software” and
at first glance appears to be a semi-legitimate VPN provider. SPEAR also found anecdotal evidence to
suggest that the in-game economies of several popular online Chinese gaming communities were
being specifically targeted via unique Kitkiot variants.

15/26

Even though the motivations of the attackers aren’t entirely obvious, the PassCV group continues to be
extremely effective at compromising small gaming companies and SPEAR believes it to be only a
matter of time before they set their sights on larger organizations.
