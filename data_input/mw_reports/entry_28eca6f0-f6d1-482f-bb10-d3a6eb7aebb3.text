TeamViewer confirmed today that it has been the victim of a cyber attack which
was discovered during the autumn of 2016, but was never disclosed. This attack is thought
to be of Chinese origins and utilized the Winnti backdoor.
The company behind the highly popular TeamViewer remote desktop software told German
publisher Der Spiegel that the attack was discovered before the threat group was capable
of doing any damage, with experts and investigators failing to find any evidence of data
being stolen during the security incident.
Also, no evidence was found that the hackers were able to compromise or steal source
code even though they had access to it, according to TeamViewer .
Backdoors which might have been planted during the 2016 attack have also been removed
after a data center overhaul and all systems "completely checked, cleaned up and
repositioned" at the end of 2016 according to the Der Spiegel report.
When asked by BleepingComputer about when and how the breach was discovered,
TeamViewer said they detected the attack before any major damage was done.

"Like many technology leaders, TeamViewer is frequently confronted with attacks by
cybercriminals. For this reason, we continuously invest in the advancement of our IT
security and cooperate closely with globally renowned experts and institutions in this field.
In autumn 2016, TeamViewer was target of a cyber-attack. Our systems detected the
suspicious activities in time to prevent any major damage. An expert team of internal and
external cyber security researchers, working together closely with the responsible
authorities, successfully fended off the attack."
Seeing that the hackers were not able to steal any data during the attack,
TeamViewer decided not to publish a security breach notification to inform the users of the
incident.
Regarding the reasons behind the decision to not disclose the breach, a TeamViewer
spokesperson further told BleepingComputer that based on consultation with relevant
authorities and advisors, it was decided that it was not necessary to disclose the attack.
Independent experts conducted a thorough investigation using all IT forensic
resources available and found no evidence that the security of our users or their IT systems
was affected in any way.
Together with the relevant authorities and our security advisors, we came to the
joint conclusion that informing our users was not necessary and would have been
counterproductive to the effective prosecution of the attackers. Against this backdrop, we
decided not to disclose the incident publicly in the interest of the global fight against
cybercrime and thus also in the interest of our users.
Attackers have also used the Winnti malware against ThyssenKrupp in 2016 and Bayer in
2018, with ThyssenKrupp CERT investigators monitoring their activity and discovering that
the hackers were only interested in stealing technical trade secrets.
In the case of the attack against the largest drugmaker from Germany, investigators from
the DCSO cybersecurity group — set up by Bayer with help from Allianz, BASF and
Volkswagen — were also able to keep an eye on the group's activity since the initial
infiltration in early-2018 until March 2019 and also concluded that the hackers were not able
to steal any data.

Service outage due to DoS attack during the summer of 2016
On June 1, 2016, TeamViewer issued a press release acknowledging a service outage
caused by a denial-of-service attack (DoS) which targeted the TeamViewer DNS server
infrastructure.
This statement followed multiple user reports claiming that attackers took control of their
computers using TeamViewer and using their PayPal accounts to either make online
purchases or steal money — a list was also created to track all the reported incidents.

Some of the victims also claimed that the attackers successfully compromised their
TeamViewer accounts even though they used unique very long passwords or had TwoFactor Authentication enabled, leading them to believe that TeamViewer's computing
systems were hacked [1, 2, 3].
However, in their press release, TeamViewer blamed the account hacks reported by its
users on "Careless use of account credentials remains to be a key problem for all internet
services. This particularly includes the use of the same password across multiple user
accounts with various internet services."
TeamViewer also mentioned the possibility of some users having unintentionally
downloaded and installed programs infected with malware which could have allowed
attackers to "virtually do anything with that particular system – depending on how intricate
the malware is, it can capture the entire system, seize or manipulate information, and so
forth."
After the user uproar caused by the "careless" word used in the June 1 press release,
Teamviewer apologized for using the word through public relation manager, Axel Schmidt.
TeamViewer also stated that the hacks reported by users might have had something to do
with the Backdoor. TeamViewer malware besides the initial mention of stolen password
credentials.
When asked if there is any connection between the account hacks reported in 2016 and the
just disclosed breach, TeamViewer told BleepingComputer that there is no connection.
No. The cyber-attack on TeamViewer is in no way connected to this.
The corresponding reports are presumably related to a theft of large amounts of data from
popular internet services (e.g. LinkedIn) in the same year. If affected users had been using
identical passwords for third-party services, such as TeamViewer, it was possible for
attackers to abuse them for unauthorized access attempts.
TeamViewer generally recommends using unique passwords for different services and
setting up a two-factor authentication to effectively prevent this kind of attack.

The Winnti Umbrella
While there is no attribution for the hacking group behind the 2016 attack TeamViewer just
confirmed, multiple hacking groups collectively known by experts as the Winnti Umbrella
according to ProtectWise 401 TRG, have been using the Winnti malware during their
attacks.

The groups come under various names (i.e.,Winnti Group, PassCV, APT17, Axiom, LEAD,
BARIUM, Wicked Panda, and GREF) but Winnti Group is the first known to have used the
Winnti backdoor during their campaigns.
As Kaspersky's GReAT full report on the Winnti Group from 2013 says, "The main objective
of the group is to steal source code of online game projects as well as digital certificates of
legitimate software vendors."
BARIUM, another Winnti Umbrella threat group, which mainly targets software and gaming
companies [1, 2] and is still active as shown by its involvement in Operation
ShadowHammer could be the most probable candidate for this attack.
Kaspersky also found evidence that connected the methods and tools used as
part of Operation ShadowHammer with the ones employed in the supply chain
attacks against CCleaner and NetSarang from 2017, with the threat actor behind the latter
already having been identified as BARIUM by ESET, Microsoft, and other security
researchers.
