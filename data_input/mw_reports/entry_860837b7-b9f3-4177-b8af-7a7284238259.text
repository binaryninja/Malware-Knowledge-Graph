INTRODUCTION
The SideCopy APT Group has expanded its activity this year and now targets critical Indian
sectors this time.
Quick Heal Security Labs researchers have been tracking the notorious cyber-attack group
– ‘Transparent Tribe’ since the ﬁrst SideCopy campaign in September 2020, discovered by
Quick Heal.
The team has recently discovered an increase in SideCopy’s activities targeting certain
Government agencies in India. The group has added new malware tools to its arsenal.
Another attack campaign that we had discovered in March 2021 (ref. blog), seems to be part
of the more extensive SideCopy campaign. The spear-phishing attack campaign used the
Army Welfare Education Society’s scholarship form as a lure.
The second wave of SideCopy uses COVID-19 as a lure, which is not unique since, in the last
year & a half, the COVID-19 theme has been used in numerous cyber-attacks. However, this
is the ﬁrst time that the COVID-19 theme is being used in the SideCopy campaign.
In most cases, successful execution of the attack would result in deploying a Remote
Administration Tool. If a RAT gets installed, the attackers will get unrestricted access to the
machine and steal sensitive data from these agencies.

(Initial Intrusion via LNK ﬁle)
Whitepaper - Operation SideCopy

01

The initial intrusion chain begins with a spear-phishing email that attempts to lure users
into extracting the attached zip archive. Upon extraction, the user would see a document
ﬁle that is an extension spoofed LNK ﬁle. If the user opens the document, the LNK payload
gets launched and initiates the malicious activities in the background. To ensure the user is
not suspicious, a decoy document is presented to the user.

HTA Payload

(660427971b04313c2ebf2410f9ba4f67c5f1d8ecc472be6c709546a12dc97f7d)

Once the LNK ﬁle is launched, it downloads the HTA payload from a compromised domain
and executes it via mshta.exe. This HTA ﬁle is responsible for showing the decoy document
to the user. In addition, it drops an executable of ReverseRAT on disc and executes it.

Custom C# Implant - ReverseRAT
The APT group carefully chooses their targets, upgrades tools in their arsenal based on the
targets, and mainly uses limited but eﬀective functionality in being evasive.
Most of the backdoors used in the campaign are NJRat; however, in one speciﬁc case, we
came across a new payload written in C#, which installs an implant enabling attacker to
examine the target and install other backdoors. This implant appears to be an advanced
version of the implant that we analyzed in our previous write-up.

We noticed attackers are using a custom payload to drop the ﬁnal implant, encrypted with
Triple-DES in ECB mode, on disc with persistence via AutoRun registry key.

Stage 2 features in detail
This implant has additional features as compared to the previous version. This continuous
enhancement of the attack tools shows that the attack group is active and is developing
tools to target potential victims better.

Feature - Download and Execute

(Stage 2: Download and Execute)

The download and execute routines are diﬀerent from the previous version. The code has
been made simpler and smaller than before. The base64 encoded staged binary is fetched
from C2 and decoded and saved on disc in folder “wininets” before execution.

Feature - Update the working binary

(Stage 2: Update Binary)

The implant updates itself on commands issued by C2. The update mechanism is simple:
•

The implant fetches the updated version

•

Writes it to the current working directory with the name “jingo.exe.”

•

Stops the current process of working binary

•

Closes sockets

•

Starts a newly updated binary while killing itself

Feature - Self-Kill

(Stage 2: Self-Kill)

Whitepaper - Operation SideCopy

06

01

The implant can kill itself if the target is not of interest to the attacker. The command
pushed from C2 “CLOSE” is meant to kill the connection. It, however, does not clear all the
artifacts of persistence, so the attacker regains connection once the system is rebooted.

Feature - Capture Screenshots

(Stage 2: Screenshot Capture)

ReverseRAT can capture screenshots on the victim’s machine. Method “Capture” accepts
two parameters as integers - dimension width and height of the JPEG - provided by C2 in
command. Once the function completes its job, it encrypts the image with AES with ECB
mode and sends it back to C2.

(NJRAT Conﬁguration)

Through telemetry, we noticed NJRat connecting to “149.248.52.61”. Further analysis
showed that the RAT came via a zip ﬁle containing an SFX archive, which dropped a
VBScript. This VBScript launched the C# variant of NJRAT connecting to the host mentioned
above on port 87. After doing further research, we noticed that it's a code reused from
GitHub.

ATTRIBUTION
1. MachineID
Since releasing our previous report on Operation SideCopy in September 2020, we have
been monitoring the activities of this attack group. We noticed that the group kept using the
same machine to create most of their payloads:

(A sample from campaign in 2020)

(Sample used in this campaign)

The above images show that the attacker used the same machine (with ID
“desktop-g1i8n3f”) to create these LNK ﬁles. This clearly points to the current attack also
being part of the SideCopy campaign.

2.

The ReverseRAT payload connects to Ips hosted on CONTABO. Transparent Tribe,
the group believed to be behind Operation SideCopy, uses CONTABO to host pay
loads or serve as C&C.

3.

In a previous investigation, we observed that most hosts used in the SideCopy
campaign resolve to subdomains having “VMI” and “VDM” strings at the beginning.
The same is the case in this attack as well.

The whois information from the hosts indicate that the attack mentioned in our
previous blog (ref. blog) related to spear-phishing campaign using Army Welfare
Education Society’s scholarship form is part of the same group.

EXPANSION IN OPERATIONS
SideCopy seems to be expanding its campaign to other countries as well. During our
analysis, we came across a sample that appears to have come from a USA-based entity.

(65ae52ac448a011701c4f077449112329b79f23f758524dd753dfe757c52f508 - abc.hta)

This sample is also generated from the same machine (machine with ID “desktop-g1i8n3f”).
Upon execution, it launches an HTA payload and opens a decoy document.

The payload connects back to IP address “149.248.52.61”, which is the same as the other
identiﬁed samples.
The EXIF data of the decoy ﬁle shows that it was created on 2020-08-25T04:01:00Z. This
indicates that actors are using this host for at least the second half of 2020.

FINDING THE REAL ATTACKER
Based on our telemetry intelligence and data from VirusTotal, we determined that the
attackers were leveraging compromised websites that targeted organizations would
generally access. This shows that attackers did detailed reconnaissance before launching
the campaign.
By data analysis, we came across the type of individuals that the campaign is targeting. In
addition, we also identiﬁed types of websites that are being used to host attack artifacts &
serve as Command & Control servers. This gave us a pivot, and we landed on two
compromised websites where C2s were active and accessible.

(PHP script serving payloads to targeted victims based on the User-Agent)

By analyzing accessible artifacts from these compromised websites, we uncovered that the
threat actor is managing the campaign through a PHP script. Attackers use phishing emails
to lure targeted individuals to these websites, where the PHP script serves the malicious
payload based on user-agent info. In this example, Windows users are targeted. If the
user-agent includes the string “Windows NT 10” or “Windows NT 6.3”, the actual payload is
served. Otherwise, the decoy payload is done.

Along with that, visitor logs are also saved in a text ﬁle. Over time, attackers may serve
diﬀerent payloads via the same PHP script for repeated visitors. This shows the level of
sophistication of this campaign.

(Sample Victim Data Logs)

Each campaign is monitored, and victim attributes are maintained in text and CSV ﬁles:
1.

IP Address

2.

Timestamp at which the payload was served

3.

User-Agent info

Here is an example of the type of lure being used in phishing mails.

We identiﬁed the following IP addresses through further data analysis, pointing to entities
in Telecom, Power, and Finance sectors as potential targets. This is likely a subset of targets,
though, as we suspect that several other government entities are being targeted in this
campaign.

HANDLER ATTRIBUTION CONNECTING THE DOTS
During the data analysis from C2 servers, we found a speciﬁc IP in almost all the logs. In fact,
in both the C2 servers that we analyzed, this particular IP was the ﬁrst entry. We believe this
IP belongs to the test machine from which attackers validate whether their setup works
ﬁne.

(IP found as ﬁrst entry in logs on C2 servers)

Analyzing publicly available information on IP address 182.191.210.191 tells us that IP is
located in Pakistan and is provided by PTCL (Pakistan Telecommunications Company Ltd.)

CONCLUSION
Transparent Tribe attack group has been linked with Pakistan in the past as well. The
evidence presented in this paper goes on to strengthen that claim even further.
In the current campaign, SideCopy/Transparent Tribe is once again targeting critical
government entities in India. The attack tools & methods have also been enhanced to make
detection diﬃcult. This shows that this attack group is well funded and actively improves
attack mechanisms to inﬁltrate the target entities.
We advise our customers to be aware of such attacks, set up necessary cybersecurity
controls, follow good cybersecurity practices, train their employees on cyber risks, and keep
monitoring their environment for anything suspicious.
