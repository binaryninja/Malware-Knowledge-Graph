BLACKGEAR is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in Taiwan for many years.
Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this campaign, which used the ELIRKS
backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It is known for using blogs and microblogging
services to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an
attacker to change the C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.

Like most campaigns, BLACKGEAR has evolved over time. Our research indicates that it has
started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion: first, the fake documents
that are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using
blogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&C activity.
This post will discuss this C&C routine, the tools used in these attacks, and the connections
between these tools.

C&C configuration retrieval

Figure 1. Overview of C&C configuration retrieval method
Backdoors used by BLACKGEAR share a common characteristic: they all retrieve encrypted
C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs. An attacker would register an
account on these services and then create posts. The encrypted C&C information would be
between two hardcoded tags, as seen below:

Figure 2. Encrypted configuration information between tags
There are two reasons BLACKGEAR would use this technique. First, the beacon traffic of the
backdoor would look like normal traffic to blogs. Secondly, the threat actor would be able to
quickly change the C&C servers used if these were blocked. A defender would be unable to
block this change in server from reaching any affected machines unless the legitimate site
was blocked as well.

Figure 3. Tools used by BLACKGEAR campaign
The malware tools used by BLACKGEAR can be categorized into three categories: binders,
downloaders and backdoors. Binders are delivered by attack vectors (such as phishing and
watering hole attacks) onto a machine. These, in turn, drop decoys and downloaders. The
latter connect to various sites under the control of the attacker and downloads backdoors.
These use persistent methods to ensure that they remain present on the affected machines to
give attackers access to the machine in question.
By separating the attack tools into three stages, threat actors are able to adapt quickly. If one
component is detected and/or blocked, it can be replaced without disrupting the entire
toolset.

Binder
The binder (which we detect as the TROJ_BLAGFLDR family) hides as a normal folder by
changing its icon to a folder icon. Once the victim executes it, it executes the downloader in
the background, drops a decoy folder that includes fake documents, then delete itself. This is
so the victim won’t notice that the malicious downloader has been executed.

Downloader
TSPY_RAMNY
TSPY_RAMNY is a downloader dropped by TROJ_BLAGFLDR malware. To remain persistent, it
moves itself to the Windows temp folder and drops a *.lnk (Windows Shortcut) file in the startup
folder that points to itself. It also sends information about the compromised host (such as
network settings) back to the download site.
The download link is formatted in the following format:
http://{IP address}/{folder name}/{webpage name} (Example: http://{IP
address}/multi/index.html)
This is done so that if someone looks solely at the URL, the download of the backdoor will
appear to be an ordinary website.

TSPY_YMALRMINI
TSPY_YMALRMINI is another downloader that is dropped by TROJ_BLAGFLDR malware, which
also sends information about compromised hosts back to the download site. We were unable
to determine which payloads were used by this downloader. However, our research indicates

that some of these downloads are saved as drWaston.exe on the compromised host. This
same file name is also used by some ELIRKS variants, indicating a possible connection.
TSPY_YMALRMINI uses the same URL format as RAMNY.
TSPY_YMALRMINI has the same download link pattern as TSPY_RAMNY. The family name for this
malware is because some variants have the PDB string “C:\toolson-mini\YmailerCreater –
Debug\Binder\Binder\YMailer.pdb”. In addition, these variants also create a log file
named YmailerMini.log.

Backdoors
BKDR_ELIRKS
BKDR_ELIRKS was the first family of backdoors tied to BLACKGEAR. It retrieves encrypted C&C
configuration information from various blogging or microblogging services. Once decoded, it
connects to these C&C servers and waits for commands given by a threat actor. To remain
persistent, it moves itself to the Windows temp folder and drops a *.lnk (Windows Shortcut) file
in the startup folder that points to itself.
Its backdoor routines include getting information from the compromised host, downloading
and running files, taking screenshots, and opening a remote shell.

BKDR_YMALR
BKDR_YMALR is a backdoor written using the .NET framework which is also known as
LOGEDRUT. The detection name comes from a log file created by this malware family
named YMailer.log. Its behavior is similar to ELIRKS – both in terms of C&C information retrieval
and available commands to a threat actor.

Encryption and Decryption
BKDR_ELIRKS
Reverse analysis of ELIRKS allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information,
which is done in the following Python code:
#! /usr/bin/env python
from ctypes import *
def decipher(v, k):
y=c_uint32(v[0])
z=c_uint32(v[1])
sum=c_uint32(0xC6EF3720)
delta=c_uint32(0x61C88647)
n=32
w=[0,0]
while(n>0):
z.value -= (y.value + sum.value) ^ (y.value * 16 + k[2]) ^ (( y.value >> 5 ) + k[3])
y.value -= (z.value + sum.value) ^ (z.value * 16 + k[0]) ^ (( z.value >> 5 ) + k[1])
sum.value += delta.value
n -= 1
w[0]=y.value
w[1]=z.value
return w
if __name__ == '__main__':
key = [0x8F3B39F1, 0x8D3FBD96, 0x473EAA92, 0x502E41D2]
ciphertext = [ciphertext1, ciphertext2] # you can input cipher text here
res = decipher(ciphertext, key)
plaintext = "%X" % (res[0])
c4 = str(int("0x"+plaintext[6:8],16))
c3 = str(int("0x"+plaintext[4:6],16))
c2 = str(int("0x"+plaintext[2:4],16))
c1 = str(int("0x"+plaintext[:2],16))
print c4+"."+c3+"."+c2+"."+c1

The malware contains shellcode with two things: the URL of the blog entry and the tags that
identify where in the fake articles the hidden C&C information is located. Once the fake
blog/microblog posts are downloaded, the malware finds and decrypts the C&C information.
The C&C information is stored in the post in two short bits of text. The first is an eight-character
string that is decoded into a six-byte hexadecimal value. The second is a two-character string
which is already in a hexadecimal format, and is concatenated towards the end. A modified
version of the TEA algorithm decrypts these into the C&C server locations.

Figure 4. BKDR_ELIRKS decryption algorithm
BKDR_YMALR
BKDR_YMALR implements the same behavior in a slightly different manner. It contains several
encrypted strings:

Figure 5. Encrypted strings in BKDR_YMALR
These encrypted strings are the result of the blog URLs and tags being first encoded
with Base64, and then encrypted with DES. The encryption key and initialization vector are
hardcoded, with both set to 1q2w3e4r. (Note how these are positioned on a normal
keyboard.)

Figure 7. BKDR_YMALR decryption algorithm
Once these have been decoded, BKDR_YMALR uses the same algorithm as ELIRKS to obtain
the C&C information.

Figure 9. Connections between tools
More than just tools being used together, it appears that there are distinct connections
between the different tools used by BLACKGEAR. The string “YMailer” shows up in the
filenames of log files used by both BKDR_YMALR and TSPY_YMALRMINI, and it is in the PDB
strings of the latter. The two downloaders TSPY_RLMNY and TSPY_YMALRMINI both use the
string toolson in different places. Lastly, both downloaders and one backdoor share the same
decryption key 1q2w3e4r. The above illustration shows the connections between the families.

Conclusion
Malware threats need to evolve or otherwise become non-threats. Similarly, to stay relevant,
BLACKGEAR has evolved with both new tools and new targets, and will continue to be a
threat for the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor its activities in order to protect
our customers.
