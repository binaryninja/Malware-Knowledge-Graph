Palestine-Aligned Hackers Use New NimbleMamba Implant in
Recent Attacks

An advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group operating with motives that likely align with
Palestine has embarked on a new campaign that takes advantage of a previously undocumented
implant called NimbleMamba.
The intrusions leveraged a sophisticated attack chain targeting Middle Eastern governments,
foreign policy think tanks, and a state-affiliated airline, enterprise security firm Proofpoint said in a
report, attributing the covert operation to a threat actor tracked as Molerats (aka TA402).
Notorious for continuously updating their malware implants and their delivery methods, the APT
group was most recently linked to an espionage offensive aimed at human rights activists and
journalists in Palestine and Turkey, while a previous attack exposed in June 2021 resulted in the
deployment of a backdoor called LastConn.

But the lull in the activities has been offset by the operators actively working to retool their arsenal,
resulting in the development of NimbleMamba, which is designed to replace LastConn, which, in
turn, is believed to be an upgraded version of another backdoor called SharpStage that was used
by the same group as part of its campaigns in December 2020.
"NimbleMamba uses guardrails to ensure that all infected victims are within TA402's target region,"
the researchers said, adding the malware "uses the Dropbox API for both command-and-control as
well as exfiltration," suggesting its use in "highly targeted intelligence collection campaigns."

Also delivered is a trojan dubbed BrittleBush that establishes communications with a remote server
to retrieve Base64-encoded commands to be executed on the infected machines. What's more, the
attacks are said to have occurred in tandem with the aforementioned malicious activity targeting
Palestine and Turkey.
The infection sequence mirrors the exact same technique used by the threat actor to compromise
its targets. The spear-phishing emails, which act as the starting point, contain geofenced links that
lead to malware payloads — but only if the recipient is in one of the targeted regions. If the targets

live outside of the attack radius, the links redirect the user to a benign news website like Emarat Al
Youm.

However, more recent variations of the campaign in December 2021 and January 2022 have
involved the use of Dropbox URLs and attacker-controlled WordPress sites to deliver malicious
RAR files containing NimbleMamba and BrittleBush.
The development is the latest example of adversaries using cloud services, such as Dropbox, to
launch their attacks, not to mention how quickly sophisticated actors can respond to public
disclosures of their invasion methods to create something potent and effective that can go past
security and detection layers.

"TA402 continues to be an effective threat actor that demonstrates its persistence with its highly
targeted campaigns focused on the Middle East," the researchers concluded. "The [two] campaigns
demonstrate Molerats' continued ability to modify their attack chain based on their intelligence
targets."
