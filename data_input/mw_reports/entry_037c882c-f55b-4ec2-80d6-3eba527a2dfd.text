Ransomware tactics and techniques continued to evolve in 2021, which demonstrates ransomware
threat actors’ growing technological sophistication and an increased ransomware threat to
organizations globally.
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory—authored by cybersecurity authorities in the United States,
Australia, and the United Kingdom—provides observed behaviors and trends as well as mitigation
recommendations to help network defenders reduce their risk of compromise by ransomware.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom observed the
following behaviors and trends among cyber criminals in 2021:




Gaining access to networks via phishing, stolen Remote Desktop Protocols (RDP)
credentials or brute force, and exploiting vulnerabilities. Phishing emails, RDP
exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top three initial infection
vectors for ransomware incidents in 2021. Once a ransomware threat actor has gained code
execution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. Note: these infection
vectors likely remain popular because of the increased use of remote work and schooling
starting in 2020 and continuing through 2021. This increase expanded the remote attack
surface and left network defenders struggling to keep pace with routine software patching.
Using cybercriminal services-for-hire. The market for ransomware became increasingly
“professional” in 2021, and the criminal business model of ransomware is now well
established. In addition to their increased use of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS),
ransomware threat actors employed independent services to negotiate payments, assist
victims with making payments, and arbitrate payment disputes between themselves and other
cyber criminals. NCSC-UK observed that some ransomware threat actors offered their victims
the services of a 24/7 help center to expedite ransom payment and restoration of encrypted
systems or data.
Note: cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom assess
that if the ransomware criminal business model continues to yield financial returns for
ransomware actors, ransomware incidents will become more frequent. Every time a ransom is
paid, it confirms the viability and financial attractiveness of the ransomware criminal business
model. Additionally, cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United
Kingdom note that the criminal business model often complicates attribution because there
are complex networks of developers, affiliates, and freelancers; it is often difficult to identify
conclusively the actors behind a ransomware incident.



Sharing victim information. Eurasian ransomware groups have shared victim information
with each other, diversifying the threat to targeted organizations. For example, after
announcing its shutdown, the BlackMatter ransomware group transferred its existing victims to
infrastructure owned by another group, known as Lockbit 2.0. In October 2021, Conti





ransomware actors began selling access to victims’ networks, enabling follow-on attacks by
other cyber threat actors.
Shifting away from “big-game” hunting in the United States.
o In the first half of 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and Australia
observed ransomware threat actors targeting “big game” organizations—i.e., perceived
high-value organizations and/or those that provide critical services—in several highprofile incidents. These victims included Colonial Pipeline Company, JBS Foods, and
Kaseya Limited. However, ransomware groups suffered disruptions from U.S.
authorities in mid-2021. Subsequently, the FBI observed some ransomware threat
actors redirecting ransomware efforts away from “big-game” and toward mid-sized
victims to reduce scrutiny.
o The ACSC observed ransomware continuing to target Australian organizations of all
sizes, including critical services and “big game,” throughout 2021.
o NCSC-UK observed targeting of UK organizations of all sizes throughout the year, with
some “big game” victims. Overall victims included businesses, charities, the legal
profession, and public services in the Education, Local Government, and Health
Sectors.
Diversifying approaches to extorting money. After encrypting victim networks, ransomware
threat actors increasingly used “triple extortion” by threatening to (1) publicly release stolen
sensitive information, (2) disrupt the victim’s internet access, and/or (3) inform the victim’s
partners, shareholders, or suppliers about the incident. The ACSC continued to observe
“double extortion” incidents in which a threat actor uses a combination of encryption and data
theft to pressure victims to pay ransom demands.

Ransomware groups have increased their impact by:






Targeting the cloud. Ransomware developers targeted cloud infrastructures to exploit known
vulnerabilities in cloud applications, virtual machine software, and virtual machine
orchestration software. Ransomware threat actors also targeted cloud accounts, cloud
application programming interfaces (APIs), and data backup and storage systems to deny
access to cloud resources and encrypt data. In addition to exploiting weaknesses to gain
direct access, threat actors sometimes reach cloud storage systems by compromising local
(on-premises) devices and moving laterally to the cloud systems. Ransomware threat actors
have also targeted cloud service providers to encrypt large amounts of customer data.
Targeting managed service providers. Ransomware threat actors have targeted managed
service providers (MSPs). MSPs have widespread and trusted accesses into client
organizations. By compromising an MSP, a ransomware threat actor could access multiple
victims through one initial compromise. Cybersecurity authorities in the United States,
Australia, and the United Kingdom assess there will be an increase in ransomware incidents
where threat actors target MSPs to reach their clients.
Attacking industrial processes. Although most ransomware incidents against critical
infrastructure affect business information and technology systems, the FBI observed that





several ransomware groups have developed code designed to stop critical infrastructure or
industrial processes.
Attacking the software supply chain. Globally, in 2021, ransomware threat actors targeted
software supply chain entities to subsequently compromise and extort their customers.
Targeting software supply chains allows ransomware threat actors to increase the scale of
their attacks by accessing multiple victims through a single initial compromise.
Targeting organizations on holidays and weekends. The FBI and CISA observed
cybercriminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on holidays and
weekends throughout 2021. Ransomware threat actors may view holidays and weekends—
when offices are normally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network
defenders and IT support personnel at victim organizations. For more information, see joint
FBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory, Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends.

MITIGATIONS
Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend
network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware
incidents:




Keep all operating systems and software up to date. Timely patching is one of the most
efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to
cybersecurity threats. Regularly check for software updates and end of life (EOL) notifications,
and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities. In cloud environments, ensure that
virtual machines, serverless applications, and third-party libraries are also patched regularly,
as doing so is usually the customer’s responsibility. Automate software security scanning and
testing when possible. Consider upgrading hardware and software, as necessary, to take
advantage of vendor-provided virtualization and security capabilities.
If you use RDP or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them closely.
o Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and
using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed
operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate
credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private
network (VPN), virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and
secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor
remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of
attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused
remote access/RDP ports.
o Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable
ports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP
Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).
o Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access
servers that are necessary, and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e.,
SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.

Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your
organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software
or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.
Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems
to execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.
Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content
from running.

Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among
users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening
suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and
spearphishing emails.
Require MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that
access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.
Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be
reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have
access. Note: devices with local admin accounts should implement a password policy,
possibly using a password management solution (e.g., Local Administrator Password Solution
[LAPS]), that requires strong, unique passwords for each admin account.
If using Linux, use a Linux security module (such as SELinux, AppArmor, or SecComp)
for defense in depth. The security modules may prevent the operating system from making
arbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against ransomware, as well as
against remote code execution (RCE).
Protect cloud storage by backing up to multiple locations, requiring MFA for access,
and encrypting data in the cloud. If using cloud-based key management for encryption,
ensure that storage and key administration roles are separated.

Malicious cyber actors use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility
and mapping. To limit an adversary’s ability to learn an organization’s enterprise environment and to
move laterally, take the following actions:




Segment networks. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by
controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting
adversary lateral movement. Organizations with an international footprint should be aware that
connectivity between their overseas arms can expand their threat surface; these organizations
should implement network segmentation between international divisions where appropriate.
For example, the ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which
Australian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents
affecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions (outside their control).
Implement end-to-end encryption. Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) can
prevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat actors
from gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack.

Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the
indicated ransomware with a network-monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the
ransomware, leverage a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral
movement on a network. Endpoint detection and response tools are particularly useful for
detecting lateral connections as they have insight into unusual network connections for each
host. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are also
able to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with early stages of
ransomware deployment.
Document external remote connections. Organizations should document approved
solutions for remote management and maintenance. If an unapproved solution is installed on
a workstation, the organization should investigate it immediately. These solutions have
legitimate purposes, so they will not be flagged by antivirus vendors.
Implement time-based access for privileged accounts. For example, the just-in-time
access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of
the principle of least privilege (as well as the zero trust model) by setting network-wide policy
to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level. As needed, individual
users can submit requests through an automated process that enables access to a system for
a set timeframe. In cloud environments, just-in-time elevation is also appropriate and may be
implemented using per-session federated claims or privileged access management tools.
Enforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies. Minimize unnecessary
privileges for identities. Consider privileges assigned to human identities as well as nonperson (e.g., software) identities. In cloud environments, non-person identities (service
accounts or roles) with excessive privileges are a key vector for lateral movement and data
access. Account privileges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and regularly audited
against usage patterns.
Reduce credential exposure. Accounts and their credentials present on hosts can enable
further compromise of a network. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting where
accounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential protection
features—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for lateral movement
and privilege escalation.
Disable unneeded command-line utilities; constrain scripting activities and
permissions, and monitor their usage. Privilege escalation and lateral movement often
depend on software utilities that run from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run
these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. Organizations
should also disable macros sent from external sources via Group Policy.
Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test
backup and restoration. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of
operations or at least minimize potential downtime from an attack as well as protect against
data losses. In cloud environments, consider leveraging native cloud service provider backup
and restoration capabilities. To further secure cloud backups, consider separation of account
roles to prevent an account that manages the backups from being used to deny or degrade
the backups should the account become compromised.





Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and
covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Consider storing encryption keys outside
the cloud. Cloud backups that are encrypted using a cloud key management service (KMS)
could be affected should the cloud environment become compromised.
Collect telemetry from cloud environments. Ensure that telemetry from cloud
environments—including network telemetry (e.g., virtual private cloud [VPC] flow logs), identity
telemetry (e.g., account sign-on, token usage, federation configuration changes), and
application telemetry (e.g., file downloads, cross-organization sharing)—is retained and visible
to the security team.

Note: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology
networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices
for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more recommendations, including
mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity fall
victim to ransomware.

RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS
If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, cybersecurity authorities in the United States,
Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend organizations:







Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
Scan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free
of malware. This should be performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing
backups to potential compromise.
Report incidents to respective cybersecurity authorities:
o U.S. organizations should report incidents immediately to the FBI at a local FBI Field
Office, CISA at us-cert.cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service at a U.S. Secret
Service Field Office.
o Australian organizations should report incidents to the ASD’s ACSC via cyber.gov.au
or call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1).
o UK organizations should report incidents to NCSC-UK via report.ncsc.gov.uk and/or
Action Fraud, the United Kingdom’s fraud and cyber reporting centre, via
actionfraud.police.uk.
Apply incident response best practices found in the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Technical
Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the
cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Note: cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom strongly
discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Criminal activity is motivated by financial gain, so
paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations (or re-target the same
organization) or encourage cyber criminals to engage in the distribution of ransomware. Paying the

|

ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. Additionally, reducing the
financial gain of ransomware threat actors will help disrupt the ransomware criminal business model.
Additionally, NCSC-UK reminds UK organizations that paying criminals is not condoned by the UK
Government. In instances where a ransom paid, victim organizations often cease engagement with
authorities, who then lose visibility of the payments made. While it continues to prove challenging, the
NCSC-UK has supported UK Government efforts by identifying needed policy changes—including
measures about the cyber insurance industry and ransom payments—that could reduce the threat of
ransomware.
