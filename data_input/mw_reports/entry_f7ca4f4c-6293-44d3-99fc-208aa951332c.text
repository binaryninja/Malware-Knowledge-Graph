Espionage tool is the most advanced piece of malware Symantec
researchers have seen from China-linked actors.
New research by the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software, has
uncovered a highly sophisticated piece of malware being used by China-linked threat actors,
exhibiting technical complexity previously unseen by such actors. The malware appears to
be used in a long-running espionage campaign against select governments and other critical
infrastructure targets.
There is strong evidence to suggest the malware, Backdoor.Daxin, which allows the attacker
to perform various communications and data-gathering operations on the infected computer,
has been used as recently as November 2021 by attackers linked to China. Most of the

targets appear to be organizations and governments of strategic interest to China. In
addition, other tools associated with Chinese espionage actors were found on some of the
same computers where Daxin was deployed.
Daxin is without doubt the most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have
seen used by a China-linked actor. Considering its capabilities and the nature of its deployed
attacks, Daxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the
attackers to burrow deep into a target’s network and exfiltrate data without raising
suspicions.
Through Broadcom’s membership in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC),
Symantec researchers worked with the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) to engage with multiple foreign governments targeted with Daxin and assisted in
detection and remediation.
This is the first in a series of blogs. This blog provides an overview of Daxin’s capabilities and
will be followed with additional blogs providing further in-depth analysis.

Daxin technical overview
As described in more detail below, Daxin comes in the form of a Windows kernel driver, a
relatively rare format for malware nowadays. It implements advanced communications
functionality, which both provides a high degree of stealth and permits the attackers to
communicate with infected computers on highly secured networks, where direct internet
connectivity is not available. These features are reminiscent of Regin, an advanced
espionage tool discovered by Symantec in 2014 that others have linked to Western
intelligence services.
Daxin’s capabilities suggest the attackers invested significant effort into developing
communication techniques that can blend in unseen with normal network traffic on the
target’s network. Specifically, the malware avoids starting its own network services. Instead,
it can abuse any legitimate services already running on the infected computers.
Daxin is also capable of relaying its communications across a network of infected computers
within the attacked organization. The attackers can select an arbitrary path across infected
computers and send a single command that instructs these computers to establish requested
connectivity. This use case has been optimized by Daxin’s designers.
Daxin also features network tunneling, allowing attackers to communicate with legitimate
services on the victim’s network that can be reached from any infected computer.

Daxin in detail

2/9

Daxin is a backdoor that allows the attacker to perform various operations on the infected
computer such as reading and writing arbitrary files. The attacker can also start arbitrary
processes and interact with them. While the set of operations recognized by Daxin is quite
narrow, its real value to attackers lies in its stealth and communications capabilities.
Daxin is capable of communicating by hijacking legitimate TCP/IP connections. In order to do
so, it monitors all incoming TCP traffic for certain patterns. Whenever any of these patterns
are detected, Daxin disconnects the legitimate recipient and takes over the connection. It
then performs a custom key exchange with the remote peer, where two sides follow
complementary steps. The malware can be both the initiator and the target of a key
exchange. A successful key exchange opens an encrypted communication channel for
receiving commands and sending responses. Daxin’s use of hijacked TCP connections
affords a high degree of stealth to its communications and helps to establish connectivity on
networks with strict firewall rules. It may also lower the risk of discovery by SOC analysts
monitoring for network anomalies.
Daxin’s built-in functionality can be augmented by deploying additional components on the
infected computer. Daxin provides a dedicated communication mechanism for such
components by implementing a device named “\\.\Tcp4”. The malicious components can
open this device to register themselves for communication. Each of the components can
associate a 32-bit service identifier with the opened \\.\Tcp4 handle. The remote attacker is
then able to communicate with selected components by specifying a matching service
identified when sending messages of a certain type. The driver also includes a mechanism to
send back any responses.
There are also dedicated messages that encapsulate raw network packets to be transmitted
via the local network adapter. Daxin then tracks network flows, such that any response
packets are captured and forwarded to the remote attacker. This allows the attacker to
establish communication with legitimate services that are reachable from the infected
machine on the target’s network, where the remote attacker uses network tunnels to interact
with internal servers of interest.

3/9

Figure 1. Daxin can create stealthy communications channels in order to interact with
computers on highly secured networks.
Perhaps the most interesting functionality is the ability to create a new communications
channel across multiple infected computers, where the list of nodes is provided by the
attacker in a single command. For each node, the message includes all the details required
to establish communication, specifically the node IP address, its TCP port number, and the
credentials to use during custom key exchange. When Daxin receives this message, it picks
the next node from the list. Then it uses its own TCP/IP stack to connect to the TCP server
listed in the selected entry. Once connected, Daxin starts the initiator side protocol. If the
peer computer is infected with Daxin, this results in opening a new encrypted communication
channel. An updated copy of the original message is then sent over this new channel, where
the position of the next node to use is incremented. The process then repeats for the
remaining nodes on the list.
While it is not uncommon for attackers’ communications to make multiple hops across
networks in order to get around firewalls and generally avoid raising suspicions, this is
usually done step-by-step, such that each hop requires a separate action. However, in the
case of Daxin, this process is a single operation, suggesting the malware is designed for
attacks on well-guarded networks, where attackers may need to periodically reconnect into
compromised computers.

Timeline
The Symantec Threat Hunter team has identified Daxin deployments in government
organizations as well as entities in the telecommunications, transportation, and
manufacturing sectors. Several of these victims were identified with the assistance of the
PwC Threat Intelligence team.
While the most recent known attacks involving Daxin occurred in November 2021, the
earliest known sample of the malware dates from 2013 and included all of the advanced
features seen in the most recent variants, with a large part of the codebase having already
been fully developed. This suggests that the attackers were already well established by
2013, with Daxin features reflecting their expertise at that time.
We believe that before commencing development of Daxin, the attackers were already
experimenting for some time with the techniques that become part of Daxin. An older piece
of malware – Backdoor.Zala (aka Exforel) – contained a number of common features but did
not have many of Daxin’s advanced capabilities. Daxin appears to build on Zala’s networking
techniques, reusing a significant amount of distinctive code and even sharing certain magic
constants. This is in addition to a certain public library used to perform hooking that is also
common between some variants of Daxin and Zala. The extensive sharing indicates that
Daxin designers at least had access to Zala’s codebase. We believe that both malware
families were used by the same actor, which became active no later than 2009.

Links to known espionage actors
There are several examples of attacks where tools known to be associated with Chinese
espionage actors have been observed along with what we believe to be variants of Daxin.
In a November 2019 attack against an information technology company, the attackers used a
single PsExec session to first attempt to deploy Daxin before then resorting to
Trojan.Owprox. Owprox is associated with the China-linked Slug (aka Owlproxy).
In May 2020, malicious activity involving both Backdoor.Daxin and Trojan.Owprox occurred
on a single computer belonging to another organizations, a technology company.
In a July 2020 attack against a military target, the attackers made two unsuccessful attempts
to deploy a suspicious driver. When these attempts failed, the attackers resorted to different
malware instead, a variant of Trojan.Emulov. Symantec did not obtain either of the two
suspicious drivers used in this attack. However, very strong similarities between this attack
and earlier activity in which Daxin was used suggests that it is highly likely the attackers
attempted to deploy Daxin before falling back on the other malware.

Developing analysis

5/9

In summary, Daxin includes some of the most complex features we have seen in a highly
probable China-linked malware campaign. We will publish follow-up blogs over the coming
days with more detailed technical analysis and other insights from our research and
collaborations.
