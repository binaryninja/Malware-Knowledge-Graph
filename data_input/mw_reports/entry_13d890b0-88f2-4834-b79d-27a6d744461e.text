Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities Mitigations –
updated March 15, 2021
msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/05/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-mitigations-march-2021

Update March 15, 2021: If you have not yet patched, and have not applied the mitigations
referenced below, a one-click tool, the Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool is now our
recommended path to mitigate until you can patch.
Microsoft previously blogged our strong recommendation that customers upgrade their
on-premises Exchange environments to the latest supported version. For customers
that are not able to quickly apply updates, we are providing the following alternative
mitigation techniques to help Microsoft Exchange customers who need more time to patch
their deployments and are willing to make risk and service function trade-offs.
These mitigations are not a remediation if your Exchange servers have already been
compromised, nor are they full protection against attack. We strongly recommend
investigating your Exchange deployments using the hunting recommendations here to
ensure that they have not been compromised. We recommend initiating an investigation in
parallel with or after applying one of the following mitigation strategies. All the scripts and
tools mentioned in this blog, along with guidance on using them can be found here:
https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/blob/main/Security/
Customers should choose one of the following mitigation strategies based on your
organization’s priorities:
Recommended solution: Install the security patch
This method is the only complete mitigation and has no impact to functionality.
The following has details on how to install the security update:

This will not evict an adversary who has already compromised a server.
Interim mitigations if unable to patch Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019:
Implement an IIS Re-Write Rule to filter malicious https requests
Disable Unified Messaging (UM)
Disable Exchange Control Panel (ECP) VDir
Disable Offline Address Book (OAB) VDir

1/5

These mitigations can be applied or rolled back using the ExchangeMitigations.ps1 script
described below and have some known impact to Exchange Server functionality. The
mitigations are effective against the attacks we have seen so far in the wild but are not
guaranteed to be complete mitigations for all possible exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
This will not evict an adversary who has already compromised a server. This should only
be used as a temporary mitigation until Exchange servers can be fully patched, and
we recommend applying all of the mitigations at once.

ExchangeMitigations.ps1
Overview
This script contains mitigations to help address the following vulnerabilities:
CVE-2021-26855
CVE-2021-26857
CVE-2021-27065
CVE-2021-26858
This script is to be executed via an elevated Exchange PowerShell Session or elevated
Exchange Management Shell. Details for mitigations are below and additional information is
on the aforementioned GitHub.
Backend Cookie Mitigation
Applies To: CVE-2021-26855
Description: This mitigation will filter https requests that contain malicious X-AnonResourceBackend and malformed X-BEResource cookies which were found to be used in the SSRF
attacks in the wild. This will help with defense against the known patterns observed but not
the SSRF as a whole.
Note: The IIS Rewrite rules will be removed after Exchange is upgraded and the mitigation
will need to be reapplied if the security patch has not been installed.
Requirements: URL Rewrite Module
For IIS 10 and higher URL Rewrite Module 2.1 is recommended, version 2.1 (x86 and
x64) can be downloaded here:
https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite
For IIS 8.5 and lower Rewrite Module 2.0 is recommended, version 2.0 can be
downloaded here:
x86 – https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5747
x64 – https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7435

2/5

Impact: No known impact to Exchange functionality if URL Rewrite module is installed as
recommended.
Installing URL Rewrite version 2.1 on IIS versions 8.5 and lower may cause IIS and
Exchange to become unstable. If there is a mismatch between the URL Rewrite module and
IIS version, ExchangeMitigations.ps1 will not apply the mitigation for CVE-2021-26855. You
must uninstall the URL Rewrite module and reinstall the correct version.
Unified Messaging Mitigation
Applies To: CVE-2021-26857
Description: This mitigation will disable the Unified Message services in Exchange.
Microsoft Exchange Managed Availability services are also disabled to prevent mitigation
regression.
Impact: Unified Messaging/Voicemail outage when these services are disabled. The
advanced monitoring capabilities of Exchange are also disabled, due to disabling Microsoft
Exchange Managed Availability services.
ECP Application Pool Mitigation
Applies To: CVE-2021-27065 & CVE-2021-26858
Description: This mitigation will disable the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) Virtual Directory.
Microsoft Exchange Managed Availability services are also disabled to prevent mitigation
regression.
Impact: The Exchange Control Panel will no longer be available. All Exchange
Administration can be done via Remote PowerShell while the Exchange Control Panel is
disabled. The advanced monitoring capabilities of Exchange are also disabled, due to
disabling Microsoft Exchange Managed Availability services.
OAB Application Pool Mitigation
Applies To: CVE-2021-27065 & CVE-2021-26858
Description: This mitigation disables the Offline Address Book (OAB) Application Pool and
API. Microsoft Exchange Managed Availability services are also disabled to prevent
mitigation regression.
Impact: OAB will be unavailable, including downloads of the Offline Address Book by
Outlook clients. This may result in stale address book results in some scenarios and
configurations. The advanced monitoring capabilities of Exchange are also disabled, due to
disabling Microsoft Exchange Managed Availability services.

Additional hunting and investigation techniques
3/5

Nmap Script To Scan For CVE-2021-26855
Description: Detects whether the specified URL is vulnerable to the Exchange Server SSRF
Vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855). This can be used to validate patch and mitigation state of
exposed servers.
Test-ProxyLogon.Ps1
Description:
This script checks targeted exchange servers for signs of the proxy logon compromise.
Proxy logon vulnerabilities are described in CVE-2021-26855, 26858, 26857, and 27065.
This script is intended to be run via an elevated Exchange Management Shell.

Microsoft Support Emergency Response Tool (MSERT) to scan Microsoft
Exchange Server
Microsoft Defender has included security intelligence updates to the latest version of the
Microsoft Safety Scanner (MSERT.EXE) to detect and remediate the latest threats known to
abuse the Exchange Server vulnerabilities disclosed on March 2, 2021. Administrators can
use this tool for servers not protected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or where
exclusions are configured for the recommended folders below.
To use the Microsoft Support Emergency Response Tool (MSERT) to scan the Microsoft
Exchange Server locations for known indicators from adversaries:
1. Download MSERT from Microsoft Safety Scanner Download – Windows security. Note:
In case you need to troubleshoot it, see How to troubleshoot an error when you run the
Microsoft Safety Scanner.
2. Read and accept the End user license agreement, then click Next.
3. Read the Microsoft Safety Scanner Privacy Statement, then click Next.
4. Select whether you want to do full scan, or customized scan.
Full scan – The most effective way to thoroughly scan every file on the device. It is the
most effective option although it might take a long time to complete depending on the
directory size of your server.
Customized scan – This can be configured to scan the following file paths where
malicious files from the threat actor have been observed:
%IIS installation path%\aspnet_client\*
%IIS installation path%\aspnet_client\system_web\*
%Exchange Server installation path%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\*
Configured temporary ASP.NET files path
%Exchange Server Installation%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\ecp\auth\*

4/5

These remediation steps are effective against known attack patterns but are not guaranteed
as complete mitigation for all possible exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Microsoft
Defender will continue to monitor and provide the latest security updates.
