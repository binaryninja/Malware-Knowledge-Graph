As we reported in September, in campaigns we detected in two different countries, man-inthe-middle attacks had been used to spread FinFisher, with the “man” in both cases most
likely operating at the ISP level.
Continuing our research into FinFisher – the infamous spyware known also as FinSpy and
sold to governments and their agencies worldwide – we noticed that the FinFisher malware
in our previously-documented campaign, which had strong indicators of internet service
provider (ISP) involvement, had been replaced by different spyware. Detected by ESET as
Win32/StrongPity2, this spyware notably resembles one that was attributed to the group
called StrongPity. As well as detecting and blocking this threat, all ESET products –
including the free ESET Online Scanner – thoroughly clean systems compromised by
StrongPity2.
As we reported in September, in campaigns we detected in two different countries, Man-inthe-Middle (MitM) attacks had been used to spread FinFisher, with the “man” in both cases
most likely operating at the ISP level. According to our telemetry, those campaigns were
terminated on 21 September 2017 – the very day we published our research.
On 8 October 2017, the same campaign resurfaced in one of those two countries, using the
same (and very uncommon) structure of HTTP redirects to achieve “on-the-fly” browser
redirection, only this time distributing Win32/StrongPity2 instead of FinFisher. We analyzed
the new spyware and immediately noticed several similarities to malware allegedly operated
by the StrongPity group in the past.
The first similarity is the attack scenario – users trying to download a software installation
package were being redirected to a fake website serving a trojanized version of the
expected installation package. The StrongPity group was observed performing such
watering hole attacks in the summer of 2016, targeting mostly Italian and Belgian users of
encryption software.
During our research, we found several different software packages trojanized with
Win32/StrongPity2:
CCleaner v 5.34
Driver Booster
The Opera Browser
Skype
The VLC Media Player v2.2.6 (32bit)
WinRAR 5.50
Since the beginning of the campaign, our systems have recorded more than one hundred
detections of this malware.

We found a number of other similarities between StrongPity-operated malware, and the way
in which Win32/StrongPity2 is implemented:
Some parts of the code are exactly the same
The (not exactly common) structures of their configuration files share some notable
similarities, as shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1: Configuration file samples (top: StrongPity, bottom: StrongPity2)

Both use the same obfuscation algorithm (a very uncommon Byte ^= ((Byte & 0xF0)
>> 4)
Both use the same (quite old) libcurl version 7.45
Both exfiltrate files in the same way (the main payload handles exfiltration of files
previously collected and saved by a dedicated module)
Speaking of stealing data, Win32/StrongPity2 has several file types with the following
extensions in its crosshairs:
.ppt
.pptx
.xls
.xlsx
.txt
.doc
.docx
.pdf
.rtf
While searching for these files, it avoids the following folders:
%Windows%
%Windows.old%
%AppData%
%Program Files%

%Program Files (x86)%
%ProgramData%
In addition to data exfiltration, Win32/StrongPity2 is able to download and execute virtually
any other (malicious) software of the attacker’s choice, with the privileges held by the
compromised account.

How to check your system for compromise, how to clean it and how
to stay protected
To determine whether a system is infected with Win32/StrongPity2, the system can be
scanned using the free ESET Online Scanner. If Win32/StrongPity2 is detected this tool is
able to remove it.
It is also possible to check the system manually by verifying the existence of the folder
%temp%\lang_be29c9f3-83we, which the malware creates to stores its components, with
the file wmpsvn32.exe being the main one. Another easy-to-check indicator of compromise
is the presence of Registry string value located in the path
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run, named Help Manager with the
string
%temp%\lang_be29c9f3-83we\wmpsvn32.exe in its data field:

Manual clean-up of an infected system includes the following steps:
1. Killing the main component’s process, wmpsvn32.exe
2. Deleting the folder %temp%\lang_be29c9f3-83we and all its contents
3. Deleting the ‘Help Manager’ value in the above-mentioned Registry entry
It is important to note that for real-time, continuous protection we recommend using a
reputable multi-layered internet security suite.
