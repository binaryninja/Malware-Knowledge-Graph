Key Findings
Anomali Threat Research discovered cyberthreat actors distributing malicious
documents exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-8570) during a multi-stage infection
chain to install a Visual Basic (VB) executable on target machines.
This exploitation creates a backdoor that appears to only retrieve an infected
machine’s username, possibly indicating reconnaissance activity.
We assess with low confidence, based on limited technical intelligence and targeting
consistent with previously observed activity, that the advanced persistent threat (APT)
cyberespionage group known as Bahamut may be responsible for this campaign.
Bahamut is a “group for hire” and typically targets entities and individuals in the Middle
East and South Asia with spearphishing messages and fake applications as the initial
infection vector.

Overview
Based on a discovery in mid-February 2021, Anomali Threat Research assesses with low
confidence that the APT cyberespionage group-for-hire Bahamut has been conducting
malicious activity against multiple targets since at least June 4, 2020. While researching
malicious files, our researchers analyzed a .docx file (List1.docx) that contained a shared
bundled component with another .docx file that was communicating via template injection
with lobertica.info, a domain previously attributed to Bahamut.[1] Further analysis of this file
and the infection chain it follows is provided in subsequent sections below.

The header dates of a template injection domain (lobertica.info/fefus/template.dot)
contacted by Screeshot from NACTA Website.docx (including “Screeshot” spelling error)
indicated malicious activity dating back to at least June 4, 2020. The title of the document
may be a reference to Pakistan’s National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which
would be consistent with Bahamut’s previous targeting and geographical location. The June
timeframe also aligns with Pakistan’s virtual meeting with the Financial Action Task Force
(Groupe d'Action Financière) held on June 24, 2020, which resulted in keeping Pakistan on
the financial grey list for terrorism funding.[2] Additionally, in June 2020, between the 9th and
15th, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan conducted repatriation flights for
Pakistani nationals in the UAE. And, as of June 29, the UAE suspended passengers from
Pakistan, until more COVID-19-related facilities could be created.[3] While the timing may be
coincidental, sophisticated threat actors such as Bahamut are known to use real-world
events as themes for targeted cyber campaigns. Historically, in December 2016, Bahamut
reportedly targeted human rights activists in the Middle East with spearphishing attacks to
deliver Android-based malware, this persisted through 2018, with the targeting of entities
and individuals in Egypt, Iran, India, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Tunisia, and the UAE.[4]

Details
Anomali Threat Research identified malicious .docx files that exploit a remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2017-8570). The activity apparently began in June 2020
and continued through at least mid-February 2021. The actors used at least three files with
generic names: List1.docx, List for Approval.docx, and report.doc, and one appearing
to employ a NACTA theme with a typo: Screeshot from NACTA Website.docx. (Figure 1)

Technical Analysis
Threat actors distributed .docx files with the objective of dropping a rich text format (RTF)
file that began the infection process for additional malicious activity. Analysis of the .docx
revealed a multi-step infection process.
The graphic below displays the connection between the malicious files and actor
infrastructure (see Figure 2). The .xml file at the top is shown as the bundled component
that is contained inside other .docx files. The .docx files used template injection to download
a file from a malicious domain. Next, we observed an .rtf file being dropped that contained
multiple files with the objective to drop VB executables. The final layer in the chart shows
the IP addresses we observed communicating with the malicious files.

Figure 3 – Self Signed Certificate on 185.175.158.227
Figure 3 above shows a self-signed certificate on the IP 185.175.158.227, a method
Bahamut has used in the previous activity.[5] Bahamut has also been reported to have a
preference for utilizing the marketing email service MailKing.[6] The alignment of these data
points, while not conclusive, further supports the assessment that this activity may be
related to Bahamut.

DOCX Analysis
Analyzed file – List1.docx
MD5 – 3df18ecd55f8e267be39f6f757bcd5f0
The analyzed document is a .docx file with an embedded RTF object from
memoadvicr.com/kodec/report.doc (see Figure 4). The external target is placed in the
‘webSettings.xml.rels’ file, which will download the RTF file. As shown in Figure 4 the
dropped file is called report.doc, which will be analyzed in the subsequent section.

RTF Analysis
Analyzed File – report.doc
MD5 – 9dc1cdba6d5838f7984de89521f18ae8
The analyzed document is an RTF file downloaded from a .docx file containing an
obfuscated .sct file that exploits CVE-2017-8570 (RCE). Exploitation of the vulnerability
allows execution of the .sct file that in-turn executes other files dumped from the RTF.
Filenames contained in the RTF (shown in Figures 5-6) include: eisghfgh321.tmp, d.tmp,
E.sct.

The obfuscated .sct file contents were mixed with unwanted comments and confusing
variable names to inhibit static analysis. (Figure 7). But, once reconstructed with
comprehendible variable names and stripped of random strings, we were able to construct
a more comprehensible version of this .sct file (Figure 8).

Figure 8 – Beautified. sct File Contents
With a better understanding of the .sct file, we determined that the script checks the
existence of the dropped file within the %temp% folder of the victim machine. This is the file
that dropped during the exploitation of the CVE-2017-8570.
Next, the function routine readBinary reads the data in eisghfgh321.tmp and the script
replaces the first two bytes with MZ and substitutes the last two zero bytes until
eisghfgh321.tmp is molded into dwmm.exe. The executable is then dropped in the
%PUBLIC% folder on an infected machine.
The script again checks for the existence of this malicious executable in %PUBLIC% folder
and, if it exists, the winword.exe process is killed to close the initially opened decoy
document. Lastly, the executable - written in VB - functions as a backdoor on an infected
machine. After decompiling the code, we found that the POST payload, dwmm.exe, is
generated on-the-fly and dropped while communicating with the actor’s C2 via a POST
request to the actor’s Command and Control (C2) server (see Figure 9).

Figure 9 – dxmm.exe POST Request
Analysis of the POST request shows that it will send back the username that was found
located between “pt” and “tion,” as shown in Figure 10 below with brutal serving as the
username.

Conclusion
Bahamut is a sophisticated APT group that utilizes anti-analysis techniques and multi-stage
infection chains. Additionally, like many other APT groups, they employ social engineering
and user interaction for the initial infection through spearphishing emails and messages.
While we have identified many consistencies between this most recently discovered
campaign and previously reported activity attributed to Bahamut, and the targeting appears
to be consistent with Bahamut’s assessed interests, due to the lack of enough unique
indicators of compromise or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) we can only assess
with “low confidence” that Bahamut may be behind this activity. We will continue monitoring
this group for additional malicious activity and provide details when appropriate.
