Russian Hackers Haven't Stopped Probing the US Power
Grid

In recent years, hacks against the power grid have gone from a mostly theoretical risk to a
real-world problem. Two large-scale blackouts in Ukraine caused by Russian cyberattacks in
2015 and 2016 showed just how feasible it is. But grid hacking comes in less dramatic forms
as well—which makes Russia's continued probing of US critical infrastructure all the more
alarming.
At the CyberwarCon forum in Washington, DC on Wednesday, researchers from threat
intelligence firm FireEye noted that while the US grid is relatively well-defended, and difficult
to hit with a full-scale cyberattack, Russian actors have nonetheless continued to benefit
from their ongoing vetting campaign.
"There’s still a concentrated Russian cyber espionage campaign targeting the bulk of the US
electrical grid," says FireEye analyst Alex Orleans says. "The grid is still getting hit."

FireEye calls the Russia-linked hacking group that has been targeting the US grid
"TEMP.Isotope." It's also known as Dragonfly 2.0, or Energetic Bear. The group mostly uses
generic hacking tools and techniques created by other actors—a strategy known as "living off
the land"—to minimize development time and costs, while also making it harder to identify
and track its movements. But TEMP.Isotope has also created at least one custom system
backdoor, and often uses spearphishing and infected websites to compromise targets. And
the group has brought these tools to bear against the US grid in a patient and methodical
way.
"The grid is still getting hit."
Alex Orleans, FireEye
US infrastructure does have some advantages here. In the wake of the massive 2003
Northeastern blackout, utilities implemented resilience and defense standards known as the
North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection
requirements, more digestibly referred to as NERC CIP. These created minimum baselines
for defending against and dealing with natural disasters, but also promoted best practices for
network defense, including two-factor authentication, network segmentation, data storage
protections, and strict access controls for both network owners and third-parties.
All of these protections combined have hardened electricity generation and transmission
systems against attack. But not all segments of the grid are held to those standards.
Distribution entities, which often subcontract with larger organizations to deliver power
locally, often lack adequate resources and defenses. And while hackers may have a harder
time fully compromising more formidable targets, they can still achieve many of their goals
through persistent probing.
In many ways, TEMP.Isotope's actions are in the interest not of triggering large-scale
blackouts, but of traditional intelligence-gathering. The group seems to deliver information
that can be used both to expand Russian energy capabilities and to vet US systems for
weaknesses that could potentially be exploited in attacks. But the FireEye researchers point
out that the canvassing also serves other more subtly aggressive counterintelligence goals
as well.
"All of this threat activity you see from actors like Isotope requires defensive responses from
incident responders, threat intelligence within a given organization, all the way up to
potentially governments," Orleans says. "So you have this ripple upward and outward. And
this counterintelligence is for the purpose of frustrating your adversary. Utilities are the
adversary for active threat Isotope, so wearing them down through activity, creating anxiety,
fulfills what is in counterintelligence terminology known as 'degradation.'"

If you can sow discord, confusion, and fatigue, you can attack an adversary by frustrating
them rather than by masterminding an all-out physical assault. And though grid hacking may
not have yet reached a boiling point in the US, the FireEye researchers warn that consistent
probing should be taken as seriously as dramatic attacks. This is particularly true given that
the security community has seen hints over the years of potential US grid probing activity
from other countries as well, including Iran and North Korea.
For now, though, the FireEye researchers say Russian state-sponsored hackers are the
ones to watch in the US grid. "The most consistent people are likely the Russians," Orleans
says. "And I also think we likely haven’t fully uncovered the extent to which they have gotten
into the wires."
