•

The group’s reuse of publicly reported infrastructure and TTPs is
likely indicative of a group experiencing operational success and
highlights a pragmatic approach to operational security, with
RedDelta willing to continue to use publicly known infrastructure
as long as access is maintained.

Background
On July 28, 2020, Insikt Group published research identifying
that the Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong were among
several Catholic Church-related organizations targeted by the suspected
Chinese-state sponsored threat activity group RedDelta. This series
of suspected network intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study
Mission to China and The Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME),
Italy. Insikt Group assessed that the targeting of entities related to the
Catholic church is likely indicative of Communist Party of China (CCP)
objectives in consolidating control over the “underground” Catholic

church, “sinicizing religions” in China, and diminishing the perceived
influence of the Vatican within China’s Catholic community.
In addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic
Church, Insikt Group also identified network intrusions impacting law

activity group RedDelta.
Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s

enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization

including a customized PlugX variant referred to as “RedDelta PlugX,”
Cobalt Strike Beacon, and Poison Ivy.

Threat Analysis

Executive Summary
In the interim two-month period since previous Insikt Group
reporting, RedDelta has largely remained unperturbed by the extensive
public reporting on its targeting of the Vatican and other Catholic
organizations. Despite taking basic operational security measures
through changing the resolution status of command and control (C2)
domains in the immediate aftermath of this reporting, the group’s tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) remained consistent. RedDelta’s

RedDelta Cleaning Up Post-Publication
Following the publication of the original RedDelta report on July
28, 2020, the group took a number of evasive steps related to the
infrastructure used in the intrusions, including changing IP resolutions
across several of the identified command and control (C2) domains. For
example, less than one day after publication of the RedDelta research,
all of the C2 subdomains identified within the “Poison Ivy/Cobalt Strike”
cluster stopped resolving.

persistence is exemplified through resuming its targeting of both the
Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong mail servers within two
weeks of the report publication. More widely, there has been new activity
that we attribute to the group in the form of PlugX samples featuring
decoy documents themed around Catholicism, Tibet-Ladakh relations,
and the United Nations General Assembly Security Council, as well as
additional network intrusion activity targeting Myanmar government
systems and two Hong Kong universities.

RedDelta Resumes Its Targeting of the Vatican and
Hong Kong Catholic Diocese
In analyzing communications between targeted organizations and RedDelta
C2 infrastructure using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we identified
that the network communications between Catholic church organizations ceased
in the immediate aftermath of the report publication. However, this was shortlived, and within 10 days, the group returned to its targeting of the Hong Kong
Catholic Diocese mail server, and within 14 days, a Vatican mail server. This is
indicative of RedDelta’s persistence in maintaining access to these environments
for gathering intelligence, in addition to the group’s aforementioned high risk
tolerance.

On September 10, 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that the 2018
PRC-Holy See deal had been “implemented successfully”, with a renewal of the deal
expected to be announced in the coming weeks. The timing of this announcement
was preceded by RedDelta activity targeting the Vatican network dying down one
week prior, and follows a Rome visit in late August from Chinese foreign minister
Wang Yi, suggesting that the group’s intelligence tasking requirement may have
been achieved or no longer required. In the interim period since our previous
report, it is unclear whether the group was able to successfully regain access to
the Vatican network. However, the attempts to do so, followed by the emergence
of new RedDelta Catholic church-themed lure documents, again highlight the
CCP’s focus on gaining increased oversight of the Catholic community within
China.

Unlike previously identified RedDelta PlugX samples, this
one uses a legitimate Avast Proxy executable for the second
DLL side-loading phase rather than the legitimate Adobe
executable used in previously analyzed samples. When loaded
into memory, the PlugX payload uses www.systeminfor[.]com
for command and control — the same domain used across
the Catholic church-themed PlugX samples. Across all four
newly analyzed samples, the first stage DLL loader files
share an identical, uncommon import hash and rich header
with previously observed first stage RedDelta PlugX DLLs.
The loaded PlugX payload also matches the custom RedDelta
PlugX variant previously described, using RC4 encryption for
C2 communications with the same hardcoded RC4 passphrase
and configuration block decoding function.
In this sample, the user is shown a decoy document
titled “History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern
Implications,” as shown in Figure 3. Although the specific
targeting of this sample is unclear, the inclusion of the
reference to Ladakh is particularly interesting given the recent
escalation in border tensions between China and India across
this region, while Tibet remains a frequent target of Chinese
state-sponsored cyberespionage. Similar to several other
RedDelta samples, the content of the decoy document is taken
from legitimate sources, in this case from a July 2020 article
by the Asia-Pacific current affairs news site, The Diplomat.
The second PlugX sample is loaded in an almost identical
manner to the Tibet-Ladakh one above, in this case retrieving
the encrypted PlugX DAT payload from http://103.85.24[.]158/
eeas.dat. The sample uses the same Adobe executable
vulnerable to DLL side-loading seen in one of the Catholic
church PlugX samples, and uses the Avast Proxy executable
seen in the above Tibet-Ladakh sample for the second stage
side-loading. On this occasion, the zip file appears to have
been stored on Dropbox, and again, was likely delivered
through spearphishing containing a malicious link. This PlugX
sample again uses www.systeminfor[.]com for command and
control.

While the specific target of this particular sample is unclear, the use of public
documents based on topical geopolitical issues as decoys has previously been
seen in multiple RedDelta lures. Additionally, the DAT payload filename seen in this
sample, titled eeas.dat, is possibly in reference to the European External Action
Service (EEAS), the diplomatic service and combined foreign and defence ministry
of the European Union. Mustang Panda, a closely overlapping threat activity group,
has also previously used a United Nations Security Council-themed lure in historic
activity.

Outlook
RedDelta’s reuse of publicly reported infrastructure and TTPs highlights a
contrast in risk appetite across Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups.
Whereas some groups remain heavily active despite extensive public reporting
(such as APT41 and RedDelta), others drastically change behaviours or reduce
activity in response to public reporting, such as APT3. In all cases, the plausible
deniability offered by Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) operations leads
the PRC to regularly deny any involvement in such activity (1,2), including in the
RedDelta case, despite the historical body of evidence.
Given the continued RedDelta activity despite extensive public reporting,
we expect the group to continue operating with a high operational tempo with
minor tweaks in TTPs. In previous reporting, we highlighted the group’s targeting
of entities such as religious organizations and non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), which often lack the ability or will to adequately invest in security and
detection measures. This likely further fuels the group’s willingness to reuse
publicly known infrastructure and TTPs.

their associated laboratories, partners, industry
collaborators, proxy entities, and individual threat
actors.

Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,persistent
commodity malware

Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or campaign
when analysts have data corresponding to at least three points
on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium
confidence, derived from our Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie
this to a threat actor only when we can point to a handle, persona,
person, or organization responsible. We will write about the activity
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data. We
use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a particular
group when the public body of empirical evidence is clear the activity
corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation state threat actor groups or
campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag colors,
currently represented below, with more color/nation pairings to
be added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups
associated with new nations.

For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt Group uses a
naming convention corresponding to the Greek alphabet. Where we
have identified a criminal entity connected to a particular country,
we will use the appropriate country color, and where that group may
be tied to a specific government organization, tie it to that entity
specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly
identified malware.
