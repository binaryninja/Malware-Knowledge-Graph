Asian Countries

September 3, 2021

A mobile app targeting both iOS and Android users primarily from China, Korea, and Japan
was first identified by Lookout Threat Intelligence team in December 2020. The apps conduct spyware
activities by offering escort services while they steal personal information from the victim’s device. The goal
of the attackers behind this data exfiltration of personal information is extortion or blackmail.
This particular type of scam is commonly called “Sextortion” and it typically targets multiple countries.
These applications are often disguised as messaging, camera, and utility apps and are designed
to exfiltrate data such as:
Contacts
SMS data
Location information
Images from device storage

Technical Analysis
During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post that
mentioned spyware masquerading as a Korean video app named “동영상“.
Researchers at Cyble downloaded the malware samples and performed a detailed
analysis, based on which, we determined that the malware is a variant of spyware and uploads
the victim data to a Command & Control (C2) server.

APK Metadata Information
App Name: 동영상
Package Name: org.nnnmbook.sytyd
SHA256 Hash: 0bda73046fd733164877071d11318ec6dd56a6ea4e773c70ed5a3c8f7a244478
Figure 1 represents the metadata information of the application.

Information
The malware has a set of permissions, out of which the
attackers leverage three permissions to collect contacts, SMSs, and the victim’s location. These dangerous
permissions are listed in Table 1.
Permissions

Description

1/6

INTERNET

Allows applications to open network sockets

READ_PHONE_STATE

Read-only access to phone state

READ_CONTACTS

Access to phone contacts

Table 1 Permission used for malicious activity
Upon simulating the app, we observed that it initially requests users for permission to read contacts. Once
the app has this permission, it loads the app’s main activity, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 App Flow

The app uses the permissions granted by the users to perform these activities on the users’ devices:
The app reads the contacts from the compromised device and stores them in the array list

Figure 3 Reads and

collects the contacts from the compromised device
Collected contacts are stored in a JSON file and are uploaded to a C2 link as shown in figure below.

data are stored in JSON file and uploaded via C2 link
The application also has a code function to read and collect SMS data from the compromised device.

Figure 5 Collects Message details from the compromised device
As shown in Figure 6, the collected SMS details are stored in a JSON file and are uploaded to the C2
link as represented below.

SMS details to the C2 link
Upon finding the functions being called, where the collected contacts and messages are sent via C2
link, the app further connects to the function that performs additional activities such as collecting
albums and device details.

Figure 7 Sensitive information collected from the app

The app synchronizes the user’s device data with the C2 login page used by the attacker to fetch the
stored sensitive information.

Conclusion
Despite having been around for a long time, spyware still poses a significant threat as the Threat
Actors responsible are constantly adapting and using various encryption techniques to avoid detection.
This makes the removal of spyware nearly impossible. Thus, users should exercise caution while installing
applications.

SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:
Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.
Uninstall the application if you find this malware on your device.
Keep your system and applications updated to the latest versions.
Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
Download and install software only from trusted sites and official app stores.
Verify the privileges and permissions requested by apps before granting them access.
