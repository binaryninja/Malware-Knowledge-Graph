RSA Incident Response White Paper: Inside the Response of a Unique CARBANAK
Intrusion
RSA Incident Response and Discovery Practice (RSA IR) analysts spend a signiﬁcant
amount of time engaged in the research, hunting, and eﬀective response of advanced
and persistent actors. A customer engagement early-to-mid-2017 is an excellent
example of a unique case in which RSA IR successfully responded to an intrusion
perpetrated by the threat actor group CARBANAK , also known as FIN7. The
CARBANAK actions illustrated in this post and associated paper were observed with
other RSA clients as recently as November 2017, with the methods and intelligence
supplied by these publications having been used successfully to detect and track
attacker activities.
Several intrusions associated with the CARBANAK actors have been reported within the last
year, describing compromises of organizations within banking , ﬁnancial , hospitality ,
and restaurant

verticals. However, they all describe a relatively equivalent progression,

with only slight deviation in speciﬁc attacker actions. The intelligence surrounding
recent CARBANAK incidents indicate that phishing attacks

have been the groupʼs

primary method of initial compromise. After gaining access to a user system, the attackers
move laterally throughout the environment, conduct internal reconnaissance, establish
staging points and internal network paths, harvest credentials, and move towards their
intended target. However, this intrusion began with a signiﬁcantly higher level of privilege

due to the exploitation of the Apache Struts vulnerability CVE-2017-5638

allowing the

attackers to quickly gain administrative access within the clientʼs Linux environment. This
intrusion presented substantial challenges due to:
The initial intrusion vector
Unique attacker toolset
The attacker dwell time
The large, heterogeneous environment
The speed with which the attackers gained administrative access
The forensic mindfulness of the CARBANAK attackers
The attackersʼ toolset was a mix of custom tools, freely available code, and open source
software utilities. RSA IR researched all 32 of the malicious ﬁles in the CARBANAK toolset
using various publicly available and open-source resources. Six of the tools used in this
intrusion were found to have been uploaded to a publicly available anti-virus aggregation
site. Of these six, ﬁve have little-to-no detection or indication of malice from antivirus
vendors. This observation explains why the clientʼs signature-based host protection
mechanisms were unable to identify or prevent the use of these tools.

Figure 1: Findings from Public and Open Source Research of Toolset Reference
While the attackers used more than 30 unique samples of malware and tools, they also
demonstrated a normalization across Windows and Linux with respect to their toolset. The
toolsets they deployed can be broken down into ﬁve basic functionalities:
Ingress/Egress/Remote Access

Lateral Movement
Log Cleanup
Credential Harvesting
Internal Reconnaissance
The ingress, lateral movement, and internal reconnaissance mechanisms used by the
attackers during this investigation were not that sophisticated in and of themselves.
However, when viewed in aggregate, and from an operational view, RSA observed the actors
normalized their choice in toolset across the Linux and Windows environments. The
attackers in this engagement primarily used modiﬁed versions of legitimate administrative
tools, commonly used penetration testing utilities, and common network ﬁle acquisition
tools. Though specialty malware was observed during this intrusion, the attackers used
basic XOR encoding just above Layer 4 to facilitate communication, communicated via SSH
tunnel directly over TCP/443, or just transmitted and received data in clear text across the
network. Of the observed actions during this intrusion, none of the attacker tools,
techniques, or procedures were particularly advanced. However, they were still able to
bypass a signiﬁcant security stack, obtain initial access and lateral access eﬀectively, deploy
malware and toolsets with impunity, and traverse over 150 systems in the span of six
weeks. While, at ﬁrst glance, this attack was not sophisticated in its toolset, it was
sophisticated in its operationalization and agility of attackersʼ actions. The correlations
between the Linux environment tools and the Windows environment tools are shown below:

containing an in-depth review of this engagement,

including observed attacker operational patterns, TTPs, and the techniques used during this
engagement to successfully track and respond to the threat. The observations illustrated in
this paper identify that not only do CARBANAK actors have the capability to successfully
compromise various operating system environments, they have standardized and
operationalized this capability. This attribute indicates strategic operational thought and
eﬀort being invested in this groupʼs compromises, suggesting that the CARBANAK actors
are working towards becoming a more organized, structured, resourceful, and mature
threat group.
During an intrusion, time is the single most critical resource to an organizationʼs security
team and is the most signiﬁcant indicator of determining if the security team will be
successful in containing, eradicating, and remediating the extant threat. There are two
speciﬁc sets of time related to an intrusion that may determine the diﬀerence between
success and failure: the time that the attackers are in the environment prior to detection
(dwell time), and the time it takes security teams to identify, investigate, understand, and
contain the attackerʼs actions (response time). In this speciﬁc incident, the attackerʼs dwell
time at intrusion declaration was 35 days, which is a signiﬁcant amount of time given the
level of access immediately available upon compromise. However, by utilizing
the

methodology and visibility described in this paper, RSA IR was able to complete

containment, eradication, and remediation in only nine days . We also discuss

the

methodology used by RSA IR to successfully detect, investigate, understand, and

contain the attackers before the actors could achieve their intended goal.
The CARBANAK actors not only showed the capability to successfully compromise both
Linux and Windows systems, they chose a toolset that was either directly cross-platform or
extremely similar in both function and command line usage. This indicates a level of
tactical organization and operationalization not previously observed by this actor group.
Additionally, they were signiﬁcantly cognizant and aware of actions taken by the security
team, switching to new methods of ingress after initial compromise, detected remediation
actions, and environmental migration. They were methodical in their choice of staging
systems, basing the system utilized on:
a critical function of lateral access
or responder detection and investigation
They chose key systems based on their needs rather than systems the organization would
consider ʻkeyʼ assets. They ensured the toolsets they would interact with most often
contained very similar functions and commands across environments in order to limit
mistakes made at the keyboard. They included a method, whether manually or
automatically, to remove any record of their activities. They operated with purpose,
patience, planning, and most signiﬁcantly, persistence.
This intrusion was successfully discovered, investigated, contained, eradicated, and
remediated only due to the following reasons:
1. The organization invested in the necessary visibility at a host and network level to
allow analysts to rapidly and eﬀectively hunt for and investigate these types of
threats.
2. The organization had invested and empowered their personnel to creatively and
proactively hunt for, understand, investigate, and learn from threats within their
environment.
3. The organization had maintained a relationship with a proven and trusted advisory
practice and had worked to recreate and implement a solid and proven

Threat

Hunting and Incident Response methodology within their own organization.
4. The organization had a solid top-down understanding of what role Threat Hunting
and Incident Response held during daily operations and security incidents, and
provided the necessary support and enablement to subordinate units and analysts.
While a ﬁrst look at the tools used in this engagement may appear simplistic, upon review
of the entire intrusion, it becomes quickly apparent that each of them was purpose-chosen
with an overall operationalized capability in mind. CARBANAK has shown themselves to be
a coordinated and extremely persistent group of actors that are consistently moving
towards more agile methods of intrusion and standardization of processes across

heterogeneous environments. They have proven their capability to use that persistence and
agility to defeat or bypass organizational security controls. Even with the least advanced of
their capabilities, they can be a diﬃcult adversary to track within an environment due to
their speed, eﬃciency, adaptability, and care in leaving little trace of any activity. However,
this diﬃculty compounds exponentially for organizations without the necessary visibility,
practices, methodologies, or trusted partner relationships necessary to eﬀectively detect
and respond to these types of threats. This white paper shows that with the necessary
visibility, planning, methodology, and analyst enablement, organizations can be successful
against these types of threats.
