Abstract
Targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental
organizations have gone underreported despite the fact
that these organizations have been shown to be frequent
targets of these attacks. In this paper, we shed light on
targeted malware attacks faced by these organizations by
studying malicious e-mails received by 10 civil society
organizations (the majority of which are from groups related to China and Tibet issues) over a period of 4 years.
Our study highlights important properties of malware
threats faced by these organizations with implications on
how these organizations defend themselves and how we
quantify these threats. We ﬁnd that the technical sophistication of malware we observe is fairly low, with more
effort placed on socially engineering the e-mail content. Based on this observation, we develop the Targeted
Threat Index (TTI), a metric which incorporates both social engineering and technical sophistication when assessing the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that
this metric is more effective than simple technical sophistication for identifying malware threats with the highest potential to successfully compromise victims. We
also discuss how education efforts focused on changing
user behaviour can help prevent compromise. For two
of the three Tibetan groups in our study simple steps
such as avoiding the use of email attachments could
cut document-based malware threats delivered through
e-mail that we observed by up to 95%.

Introduction

Civil society organizations (CSOs), working on human rights issues around the globe, face a spectrum
of politically-motivated information security threats that
seek to deny (e.g. Internet ﬁltering, denial-of-service attacks), manipulate (e.g. website defacements) or monitor (e.g. targeted malware) information related to their
work. Targeted malware attacks in particular are an in-

creasing problem for CSOs. These attacks are not isolated incidents, but waves of attacks organized in campaigns that persistently attempt to compromise systems
and gain access to networks over long periods of time
while remaining undetected. These campaigns are custom designed for speciﬁc targets and are conducted by
highly motivated attackers. The objective of these campaigns is to extract information from compromised systems and monitor user activity and is best understood as
a form of espionage. CSOs can be particularly susceptible to these threats due to limited resources and lack
of security awareness. Targeted malware is an active research area, particularly in private industry. However,
focused studies on targeted attacks against CSOs are relatively limited despite the persistent threats they face and
the vulnerability of these groups.
In this study, we work with 10 CSOs for a period of
4 years to characterize and track targeted malware campaigns against these groups. With the exception of two
groups that work on human rights in multiple countries,
the remaining eight groups focus on China and Tibetrelated human rights issues. We focus on targeted malware typically delivered via e-mail that is speciﬁcally tailored to these groups as opposed to conventional spam
which has been well characterized in numerous previous
works [27, 42, 45, 52, 70, 71]. We consider the threats to
these groups along two axes: the technical sophistication of the malware as well as sophistication of the social engineering used to deliver the malicious payload.
We combine these two metrics to form an overall threat
ranking that we call the Targeted Threat Index (TTI).
While other scoring systems exist for characterizing the
level of severity and danger of a technical vulnerability [7, 17, 41, 50], no common system exists for ranking
the sophistication of targeted e-mail attacks. TTI allows
us to gain insights into the relative sophistication of social engineering and malware leveraged against CSOs.
A key to the success of our study is a unique methodology, combining qualitative and technical analysis of

work are discussed in Section 5. We present related work
in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.

e-mails and their attachments with ﬁeldwork (e.g. site
visits) and interviews with affected CSOs. This methodology, which we describe in more detail in Section 3, allows us to both accurately rate the level of targeting of email messages by interfacing with CSOs participating in
our study (Section 4.2), and understand the relative technical sophistication of different malware families used in
the attacks (Section 4.3). By combining the strengths of
our qualitative and quantitative analysis, we are able to
accurately understand trends in terms of social engineering and technical sophistication of politically-motivated
targeted malware threats faced by CSOs.
Our study makes the following observations, which
have implications for security strategies that CSOs can
employ to protect themselves from targeted malware:

2.1

Background
Targeted Malware Overview

Targeted malware are a category of attacks that are distinct from common spam, phishing, and ﬁnancially motivated malware. Spam and mass phishing attacks are
indiscriminate in the selection of targets and are directed
to the largest number of users possible. Similarly, ﬁnancially motivated malware such as banking trojans seek
to compromise as many users as possible to maximize
the potential proﬁts that can be made. The social engineering tactics and themes used by these kinds of attacks
are generic and the attack vectors are sent in high volumes. By contrast targeted malware attacks are designed
for speciﬁc targets, sent in lower volumes, and are motivated by the objective of stealing speciﬁc sensitive data
from a target.
Targeted malware attacks typically involve the following stages [24, 66]:

Attachments are the primary vector for email based
targeted malware. More than 80% of malware delivered to Tibet-related organizations in our study and submitted to us is contained in an e-mail attachment. Further, for 2 of the 3 Tibetan organizations in our study
(with at least 40 submitted e-mails), simply not opening
attachments would mitigate more than 95% of targeted
malware threats that use email as a vector.
Targeted malware technical sophistication is low. Social engineering sophistication is high We ﬁnd that
the technical sophistication of targeted malware delivered to CSOs in our study is relatively low (e.g., relative to commercial malware that has been found targeting
CSOs and journalists [35,36,38] and conventional ﬁnancially motivated malware), with much more effort given
to socially engineering messages to mislead users. This
ﬁnding highlights the potential for education efforts focused on changing user behaviours rather than high-cost
technical security solutions to help protect CSOs.

Reconnaissance: During this stage attackers conduct
research on targets including proﬁling systems, software,
and information security defenses used to identify possible vulnerabilities and contextual information on personnel and activities to aid social engineering.
Delivery: During this stage a vector for delivering
the attack is selected. Common vectors include e-mails
with malicious documents or links, or contacting targets
through instant messaging services and using social engineering to send malware to them. Typically, a target of
such an attack receives an e-mail, possibly appearing to
be from someone they know, containing text that urges
the user to open an attached document (or visit a website).

CSOs face persistent and highly motivated actors.
For numerous malware samples in our study we observe several versions of the software appearing over
the course of our four year study. These multiple versions show evidence of technical improvements to complement existing social engineering techniques.
Since the start of our study we have participated in
a series of workshops with the participating Tibetan organizations to translate these results into a training curriculum. Speciﬁcally, we have educated them about how
to identify suspicious e-mail headers to identify spoofed
senders and demonstrated tools that can be used to check
e-mailed links for malware and drive-by-downloads.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents relevant background on targeted malware
and attacks on CSOs. Our data collection methodology
is described in Section 3. We describe our targeting and
technical sophistication metrics as well as how we combine them to produce the Targeted Threat Index (TTI)

Compromise: During this stage malicious code is executed on a target machine typically after a user initiated
action such as opening a malicious document or link.
Command and Control: During this stage the infected
host system establishes a communications channel to a
command and control (C&C) server operated by the attackers. Once this channel has been established the attackers can issue commands and download further malware on to the system
Additional attacker actions: After a successful compromise is established, attackers can conduct a number of
actions including ex-ﬁltrating data from the infected host
and transmitting it back to attackers through a process
of encrypting, compressing, and transferring to a server

operated by the attackers. Attackers may also use peripherals such as webcams and microphones to monitor
users in real time. The infected host may also serve as
a starting point to infect other machines on the network
and seek out speciﬁc information or credentials.

2.2

campaigns against CSOs involve China and Tibet-related
groups and potentially China-related attack operators
[9–11, 23, 25, 26, 32, 61–65, 67, 68] , these kinds of attacks go beyond China. Recent research and news media
have reported attacks against large human rights groups
focused on multiple issues and countries [31, 46], and
communities related to Syria [18] and Iran [37]. Researchers have also uncovered the use of commercial
network intrusion products used to target activists from
Bahrain [38], the United Arab Emirates [36], and journalists from Ethiopia [35].

Targeted Malware and CSOs

Targeted malware has become recognized by governments and businesses around the world as a serious political and corporate espionage threat. The United States
government has been particularly vocal on the threat targeted malware enabled espionage poses. General Keith
Alexander, current Director of the National Security
Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Command has stated that the theft of US intellectual property
through cyber espionage constitutes the “greatest transfer
of wealth in history” [47]. Recent widely publicized targeted malware intrusions against Google, RSA, the New
York Times and other high proﬁle targets have raised
public awareness around these attacks [20, 44, 48]
Despite this increased attention, targeted malware is
not a new problem, with over a decade of public reports
on these kinds of attacks [66]. However, the majority
of research on targeted malware is conducted by private
security companies who typically focus on campaigns
against industry and government entities. As a result, targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental organizations have gone underreported despite the fact that
these organizations have been shown to be frequently
targeted by cyber espionage campaigns. In particular,
communities related to ethnic minority groups in China
including Tibetans, Uyghurs, and religious groups such
as Falun Gong have been frequent targets of cyber espionage campaigns with reports dating back to at least
2002 [61].
In some cases, the same actors have been revealed to
be targeting civil society groups, government and industry entities. A notable example of this was the 2009 report by the Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto, which uncovered the “GhostNet” cyber
espionage network. GhostNet successfully compromised
prominent organizations in the Tibetan community in addition to 1,295 hosts in 103 countries, including ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, and news media [25]. The GhostNet case is not
an isolated example, as other reports have shown CSOs
(commonly Tibetan organizations) included as targets in
campaigns that are also directed to a range of government and industry entities [8, 26, 28, 29, 54–56] Some of
these reports include technical details on the CSO speciﬁc attacks [26, 28, 54, 55] while others note them as a
target but do not address in detail [8, 29, 56].
While the majority of documented targeted malware

Data collection

Since our study involves dealing with e-mail messages
which may contain personally identiﬁable information
(PII) and collection of information from CSOs who need
to maintain privacy of their data, we consulted with our
institutional research ethics board during the design of
our study. The methods described below have been submitted to and approved by this board.

3.1

Study Participants

We recruited participants via three main channels: (1)
an open call on our Web site, (2) outreach to organizations we had prior relationship with and (3) referrals
from participating groups. As part of the study these
groups agreed to share technical data (e.g., e-mails with
suspicious attachments) and participate in interviews at
the onset and end of the study. Their identity and any PII
shared with us were kept strictly conﬁdential.
For the purposes of our study, we focused on organizations with missions concerning the promotion or protection of human rights. For purposes of this study, ”human
rights” means any or all of the rights enumerated under
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [60], the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [58],
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights [59]. We also considered organizations
on a case by case basis that have a mission that does not
directly implicate human rights, but who may nonetheless be targeted by politically motivated digital attacks
because of work related to human rights issues (e.g., media organizations that report on human rights violations).
In total, 10 organizations participated in the study
(summarized in Table 1). The majority of these groups
work on China-related rights issues and ﬁve of these organizations focus speciﬁcally on Tibetan rights. The high
rate of participation from China and Tibet-related human
rights issues is due in part to our previous relationships
with these communities and a signiﬁcant interest and enthusiasm expressed by the groups. In addition to the
China and Tibet-related groups, our study also includes

two groups, Rights Group 1 and 2 that work on multiple
human rights related issues in various countries.
The majority of organizations operate from small ofﬁces with less than 20 employees. Some organizations
(China Group 2, Tibet Group 2) have no physical ofﬁce
and consist of small virtual teams collaborating remotely,
often from home ofﬁces. Of these groups only two
(China Group 1, China Group 3) have a dedicated system
administrator on staff. Other groups (Tibet Groups 1-5;
China Group 2) rely on volunteers or staff with related
technical skills (e.g. Web development) to provide technical support. Rights Group 1 and Rights Group 2 are
much larger organizations relative to the others in our
sample. Both organizations have over 100 employees,
multiple ofﬁces, dedicated IT teams, and enterprise level
computing infrastructures.

work Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, website monitoring, and interviews. Also, upon request of
study groups who were concerned of possible infection
we analyzed packet capture data from suspect machines.
Through the course of this supplementary analysis we
did not ﬁnd indications of malware compromise that
used samples that were not included in our pool of usersubmitted emails. In this paper we focus on reporting
results from analyzing the user submitted emails through
the TTI. The NIDS and website monitoring components
were added later in our study and do not signiﬁcantly
contribute to TTI analysis. 1

Data Sources

We collect the following pieces of information from the
participant groups in order to understand the malware
threats they face:
User-submitted e-mail messages. Our primary data
source is a collection of e-mails identiﬁed by participants
as suspicious which were forwarded to a dedicated email server administered by our research team. When
available these submissions included full headers, ﬁle
attachments and / or links. There are three key limitations to relying on user-submitted e-mails for our analysis. First, we are only able to study e-mails identiﬁed
by participants as suspicious, which may bias our results to only reporting threats that have been ﬂagged by
users. Further, individuals may forget to forward e-mails
in some cases. Relying on self-reporting also creates bias
between groups as individuals at different organizations
may have different thresholds for reporting, which creates difﬁculties in accurately comparing submission rates
between groups. Thus the amount of threat behaviour
we see should be considered a lower bound on what occurs in practice. Second, having participants forward us
e-mails does not allow us to verify if the targeted organization was successfully compromised by the attack (e.g.,
if another member of the organization open and executed
malware on their machine) and what the scope of the attack was. Finally, e-mail is only one vector that may be
used to target organizations. Other vectors include waterhole attacks [21], denial of service attacks, or any other
vectors (e.g., physical threats like infected USB sticks).
These limitations mean that it is possible that we did not
comprehensively observe all attacks experienced by our
study groups and some more advanced attacks may have
gone unreported.
Recognizing the limitations of e-mail submissions, we
complement user submitted emails with data from Net-

3.3

Overview of User-Submitted E-mails

The e-mails examined in this study span over four years,
from October 14, 2009 to December 31, 2013. Data collection began on November 28, 2011, but China Group
3 and Tibet Group 1 forwarded us their pre-existing
archives of suspicious emails, resulting in e-mail samples dating back to October 14, 2009. In total, we received 817 e-mails from the 10 groups participating in
our study. Table 2 breaks down the submissions from
each groups and illustrates that submissions were highly
non-uniform across the groups. Thus, in general, we focus on the groups with at least 50 e-mail submissions for
our analysis.
Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of e-mail submissions per month over the course of the study. For
example, China Group 3 shared a set of e-mails received
in 2010 by a highly targeted member of the organization,
which can be observed in Figure 1. Tibet Group 1 accounts for the highest number of submissions relative to
the other groups due to being one of the ﬁrst groups in
the study and being persistently targeted by politically
motivated malware. Tibetan Groups 2 and 4, who joined
the study later (in April 2012) show a similar submission
rate to original Tibetan Group 1, suggesting these groups
are targeted at a similar rate. In Section 4.2, we investi4

gate commonalities in targeting of these groups.
We further classify e-mails as malicious if they include
attached malware, a direct link to malware or a site with
a drive-by download, or a link to a phishing page. Figure 2 shows the amount of e-mails of each type for the
groups that submitted at least 25 e-mails to our system.
The most common approach employed in these e-mails
was attaching a malicious payload to the e-mail itself.
However, we notice a higher rate of phishing attacks on
the China-related groups and the rights groups working
on multiple international human rights issues. In particular, 46% of the e-mails submitted by China Group 1,
and 50% of the e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1, direct the user to a phishing Web site. In the case of China
Group 1, this large proportion of phishing sites is observed because this group conﬁgured their spam ﬁlter to
forward e-mails to our system, resulting in us receiving
a large number of generic, non-targeted spam. In contrast, the phishing observed for Rights Group 1, while
low in volume (13 out of 26 messages) is targeted. We
delve more into how we rate the targeting of e-mails in
Section 4.2.
The rate of submissions to our project meant that it

was feasible to manually analyze e-mail attachments for
malware as they were submitted. This analysis gives us
higher conﬁdence in our results because AV signatures
are frequently unable to detect new or modiﬁed threats,
and can overlook the presence of a malicious payload
that can be easily identiﬁed upon manual inspection (e.g.
shellcode in an RTF exploit). In total, we analyzed 3,617
payload ﬁles and found 2,814 (78%) of them to be malicious. Section 4.3 describes our analysis methodology
in more detail.

Targeted Threat Index

Our dataset includes a wide range of targeted malware
threats varying in level of both social engineering and
technical complexity. This range presents a challenge
in ranking the relative sophistication of the malware and
targeting tactics used by attackers.
While scoring systems such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [17] exist for the purpose of communicating the level of severity and danger of a vulnerability, there is no standardized system for ranking

USENIX Association

23rd USENIX Security Symposium 531

the sophistication of targeted email attacks. This gap is
likely because evaluating the sophistication of the targeting is non-technical, and cannot be automated due to the
requirement of a strong familiarity with the underlying
subject material.
To address this gap we developed the Targeted Threat
Index (TTI) to assign a ranking score to the targeted malicious emails in our dataset. The TTI score is intended
for use in prioritizing the analysis of incoming threats,
as well as for getting an overall idea of how severely an
organization is threatened.
The TTI score is calculated by taking a base value determined by the sophistication of the targeting method,
which is then multiplied by a value for the technical
sophistication of the malware. The base score can be
used independently to compare emails, and the combined
score gives an indication of the level of effort an attacker
has put into individual threats.

their semantic content, and then use these results to generate a numerical metric quantifying the level of targeting
used.
4.2.1

We code the e-mails based on their subject line, body, attachments and headers using the following methodology:
Subject line, body, and attachments. The content of
the subject line, body and attachments for each submitted
e-mail were content coded into 8 themes, each containing categories for speciﬁc instances of the theme: Country / Region (referring to a speciﬁc geographical country
or region); Ethnic Groups (referring to a speciﬁc ethnic
group); Event (referring to a speciﬁc event); Organizations (referring to speciﬁc organizations); People (referring to speciﬁc persons), Political (reference to speciﬁc
political issues), Technology (reference to technical support), Miscellaneous (content without clear context or
categories that do not fall into one of the other themes).
Table 3 summarizes the themes and provides examples
of categories within each theme.

TTI Metric

The TTI score is calculated in two parts:

E-mail headers. The header of each e-mail was analyzed to determine if the sending e-mail address was
spoofed or the e-mail address was otherwise designed
to appear to come from a real person and / or organization (e.g. by registering an e-mail account that resembles
a person and / or organization’s name from a free mail
provider). We divide the results based on whether they
attempted to spoof an organization or a speciﬁc person.
Using this manual analysis, we perform a content analysis of e-mails submitted by the organizations. Results
of this analysis conﬁrm that social engineering is an important tool in the arsenal of adversaries who aim to deliver targeted malware. Speciﬁcally, 95% and 97% of
e-mails to Chinese and Tibetan groups, respectively, included reference to relevant regional issues. Spooﬁng
of speciﬁc senders and organizations was also prevalent
with 52% of e-mails to Tibetan groups designed to appear to come from real organizations, often from within
the Tibetan community. For example, a common target of spooﬁng was the Central Tibetan Administration
(CTA), referenced in 21% of the spoofed e-mails, which
administers programs for Tibetan refugees living in India and advocates for human rights in Tibet. While the
number of e-mail submissions were lower for the general human rights groups, we observe similar trends there
with 92% of e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1 appearing to come from individuals in the group (as a result
of spooﬁng).
In some cases we even observed the same attackers
targeting multiple CSOs with customized e-mail lures.
For example, we tracked a campaign that targeted China
Groups 1 and 2, and Tibet Group 1 with a remote access

(Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value)
×(Technical Sophistication Multiplier) = TTI Score
TTI scores range from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most
sophisticated attack. Scores of 0 are reserved for threats
that are not targeted, even if they are malicious. For
example, spam using an attached PDF or XLS to bypass anti-spam ﬁlters, and highly sophisticated ﬁnancially motivated malware, would both score 0.
This section overviews how we compute the Social
Engineering Sophistication Base Value (Section 4.2) and
the Technical Sophistication Multiplier (Section 4.3). In
Section 4.4, we present the results of computing and analyzing the TTI value of threats observed by the organizations in our study. We also discuss implications and
limitations of the metric.

Content coding and analysis results

Social Engineering Tactics

We leverage a manual coding approach to measure the
sophistication of social engineering tactics used in the attacks observed by the organizations in our study. While
automated approaches may be explored in the future, this
manual analysis allows us to have high conﬁdence in our
results, especially since understanding the social engineering often required contextual information provided
by the organizations in our study. To quantify the level
of sophistication, we manually analyse the e-mail subject
line, body, attachments and header ﬁelds. We perform an
initial content analysis by coding the e-mails based on

by the Dalai Lama, attached to an e-mail about a year in
review of Tibetan human rights issues.
4.2.2

Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value

While the content analysis results clearly show attacks
tailored to the interests of targeted groups, content coding alone does not give a relative score of the sophistication used in the attacks. We now describe how we assign
the “social engineering sophistication base value” to emails based on their level of social engineering.
To measure the targeting sophistication we assign a
score that ranges from 0-5 that rates the social engineering techniques used to get the victim to open the attachment. This score considers the content and presentation
of the e-mail message as well as the claimed sender identity. This determination also includes the content of any
associated ﬁles, as malware is often implanted into legitimate relevant documents to evade suspicion from users
when the malicious documents are opened.
The Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value is
assigned based on the following criteria:
0 Not Targeted: Recipient does not appear to be a speciﬁc target. Content is not relevant to the recipient. The
e-mail is likely spam or a non-targeted phishing attempt.
1 Targeted Not Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc
target. Content is not relevant to the recipient or contains
information that is obviously false with little to no validation required by the recipient. The e-mail header and/or
signature do not reference a real person or organization.
2 Targeted Poorly Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc
target. Content is generally relevant to the target but has
attributes that make it appear questionable (e.g. incomplete text, poor spelling and grammar, incorrect addressing). The e-mail header and / or signature may reference
a real person or organization.

4 Targeted Personalized: Recipient is a speciﬁc target.
The e-mail message is personalized for the recipient or
target organization (e.g. speciﬁcally addressed or referring to individual and / or organization by name). Content is relevant to the target and may repurpose legitimate
information that can be externally veriﬁed or appears to
repurpose legitimate messages. The e-mail header and /
or signature references a real person or organization.
5 Targeted Highly Personalized: Recipient is a speciﬁc target. The e-mail message is individually personalized and customized for the recipient and references
conﬁdential / sensitive information that is directly relevant to the target (e.g. internal meeting minutes, compromised communications from the organization). The
e-mail header and / or signature references a real person
or organization.
Content coding of emails and determinations of social engineering ratings for the TTI were performed by
ﬁve independent coders who were given a code book for
content categories and the TTI social engineering scale
with examples to guide analysis. We performed regular inter-rater reliability checks and ﬂagged any potential edge cases and inconsistencies for discussion and reevaluation. Following completion of this analysis, two
of the authors reviewed the social engineering base value
scores to ensure consistency and conformity to the scale.
We provide speciﬁc examples of each of these targeting
values in Appendix A.

malware attacks (e.g., the Zeus trojan masquerading as
an email from the ACH credit card payment processor,
or Bredolab malware pretending to be from the DHL
courier service) are not considered targeted attacks in our
study, but are still kept for potential review.
Once we have identiﬁed emails which we suspect of
containing politically-motivated malware, we perform
the following analysis steps on any attachments to verify that they indeed contain malware. First, we run the
attachment in a sandboxed VM to look for malicious activity e.g., an Ofﬁce document writing ﬁles to disk or trying to connect to a C&C server. We also check the MD5
hash of the attachment against the Virus Total database to
see if it matches existing viruses. We also manually examine the attached ﬁle for signs of malicious intent (e.g.,
executable payload in a PDF, shellcode or Javascript).
We exclude any graphics attached to the email which are
used for social engineering (and do not contain malicious
payload) from our analysis.
We follow this initial analysis with more detailed technical analysis of the attachments which we conﬁrm contain malware. First, we manually verify the ﬁle type of
the attachment for overview statistics. This manual analysis is necessary as the Unix ﬁle command may be misled by methods of manipulating important bytes in the
ﬁle (e.g., replacing \rtf1 with \rtf[null]). We then identify if the vulnerability included in the malware already
exists in a corpus of vulnerabilities, such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming system. We also perform analysis of network trafﬁc from
the attachment to identify the C&C server the malware
attempts to contact. In cases where the malware does
not execute in our controlled environment we manually
examine the ﬁle to extract the relevant information.
On a case-by-case basis we use additional tools such
as IDA [1] and OllyDbg [3] for detailed static and dynamic analysis, respectively. Our goal in this analysis
is to identify relationships between malware campaigns
between organizations, or instances of the same malware
family repeatedly targeting a given organization. By observing overlapping C&C servers, or mapping malware
to common exploits identiﬁed by anti virus/security companies we can cluster attacks that we believe come from
the same malware family and potentially the same adversary.

Summary of Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value

Figure 3 shows the targeting score for organizations in
our study who submitted at least 50 e-mails. We can see
that actors targeting these groups put signiﬁcant effort
into targeting their messages, in particular the three Tibetan groups included in Figure 3 observe more than half
of their messages with a targeting score of 3 or higher.
This result means adversaries are taking care to make the
e-mail appear to come from a legitimate individual or organization, and include relevant information (e.g., news
reports or exchanges from public mailing lists). Higher
targeting scores, which result from actions such as personalizing lures to an individual in the group, or including information that requires prior reconnaissance tend
to be more rare, but we do observe instances of them.
For example, in the case of China Group 3, we observed
an e-mail which received a social engineering score of 5,
which claimed to be from the group’s funder and referenced a speciﬁc meeting they had planned that was not
public knowledge.

Technical Sophistication

We manually analyzed all submitted emails and attachments to determine whether they contained politicallymotivated malware. The malware is then analyzed in detail to extract information such as the vulnerability, C&C
server (if present), and technical sophistication of the exploit.
4.3.1

Assessment methodology

4.3.2

The ﬁrst step in our analysis pipeline is determining
whether the email contains politically motivated malware
or not. This process involves an initial inspection for
social engineering of the email message and attachment
(e.g., an executable pretending to be a document). We
also correlate with other emails received as part of this
project to identify already-known malware. Well-known

Technical Sophistication Multiplier

While the previous analysis is useful for understanding
the nature of threats, we also score threats numerically to
aid in understanding the relative technical sophistication
of their approaches. Each malware sample is assigned
one of the following values:
1 Not Protected - The sample contains no code protec8

tion such as packing, obfuscation (e.g. simple rotation
of interesting or identifying strings), or anti-reversing
tricks.
1.25 Minor Protection - The sample contains a simple method of protection, such as one of the following:
code protection using publicly available tools where the
reverse method is available, such as UPX packing; simple anti-reversing techniques such as not using import
tables, or a call to IsDebuggerPresent(); self-disabling in
the presence of AV software.

1.5 Multiple Minor Protection Techniques - The sample contains multiple distinct minor code protection techniques (anti-reversing tricks, packing, VM / reversing

reported by our study groups is relatively simple. The
highest multiplier value we see is 1.5 and even that value
is seen infrequently. The majority of malware observed
is rated either 1 or 1.25 according to our technical scoring
criteria, with Tibetan Groups observing a higher fraction
of malware rated 1.25 and Chinese groups observing a
higher fraction rated 1.
The technical sophistication multiplier value is also
useful for assessing the technical evolution of threats in
our study. When we group malware into different family groups we can see some of these groups are under
active development. For example, we observe multiple
versions of the Enfal [40, 49], Mongal [14], and Gh0st
RAT [15] families with increasing levels of sophistication and defenses in place to protect the malware code
(resulting in an increase in technical multiplier from 1 to
1.25 for these families). Since our technical multiplier
value focuses on how well malware code defends and
disguises itself, changes to other aspects of the code may
not result in an increase in value (e.g., we observe multiple versions of the IMuler.A/Revir.A malware which all
receive a score of 1). Interestingly, when we observe both
a Windows and Mac version of a given malware family,
the technical score for the Mac version tended to be lower
with the Mac version being relatively primitive relative to
the Windows variant.

1.75 Advanced Protection - The sample contains minor code protection techniques along with at least one
advanced protection method such as rootkit functionality
or a custom virtualized packer.
2 Multiple Advanced Protection Techniques - The
sample contains multiple distinct advanced protection
techniques, e.g. rootkit capability, virtualized packer,
multiple anti-reversing techniques, and is clearly designed by a professional software engineering team.
The purpose of the technical sophistication multiplier
is to measure how well the payload of the malware can
conceal its presence on a compromised machine. We use
a multiplier because advanced malware requires significantly more time and effort (or money, in the case of
commercial solutions) to customize for a particular target.
We focus on the level of obfuscation used to hide program functionality and avoid detection for the following reasons: (1) It allows the compromised system to
remain infected for a longer period; (2) it hinders analysts from dissecting a sample and developing instructions to detect the malware and disinfect a compromised
system; (3) since most common used remote access trojans (RATs) have the same core functionality (e.g. keylogging, running commands, exﬁltrating data, controlling microphones and webcams, etc.) the level of obfuscation used to conceal what the malware is doing can
be used to distinguish one RAT from another.

TTI Results

We now show how the TTI metric can help us better characterize the relative threat posed by targeted malware.
Figure 5 shows the technical sophistication multiplier
and maximum/minimum TTI scores for malware families observed in our dataset. Since we primarily observe
simple malware, with a technical sophistication multiplier of 1 or 1.25, this value does a poor job of differentiating the threat posed by the different malware families
to the CSOs. However, by incorporating both the technical sophistication and targeting base value into the TTI
metric we can gain more insights into how effective these

threats may be in practice.
The impact of using TTI is especially apparent when
trying to gain insights into the targeted malware that
poses the biggest risk to CSOs. Table 4 shows the top
5 malware families we observe in terms of technical sophistication and in terms of TTI score. If we consider the
malware families with the highest technical sophistication, we can see that their TTI values are relatively low,
with maximums ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. These tend to be
malware families that are familiar to researchers. In particular, PlugX and PoisonIvy have been used in targeted
attacks together [43] and PlugX is still actively used and
under constant development [16]. Despite technical sophistication, the social engineering lures of these threats
are not well crafted and pose less of a risk to the CSOs
whose members may be able to identify and avoid these
threats.
In contrast, the top 5 malware families in terms of
TTI have lower technical sophistication (1.25) but much
higher levels of social engineering. It is no surprise that
threats which score the highest TTI use well known malware that have been extensively documented in attacks
against a variety of targets. For example, the TTI scores
reﬂect that Gh0st RAT continues to be seen in higher
risk attacks due to its popularity amongst attackers even
though it is an older and not particularly advanced tool.
Since there is no direct connection between the technical
sophistication of threats and the level of social engineering used to target CSOs, it is likely that different threat
actors, with a different focus, are at work here. Indeed,
Gh0st RAT was discovered by the Citizen Lab in their
analysis of GhostNet [25] and IEXPL0RE RAT was discovered and named for the ﬁrst time in our work.
Another observation is that commercial malware such
as FinFisher and DaVinci RCS, while being of much
higher technical sophistication (relative to the samples in

our study), do not necessarily score higher on TTI than
a targeted attack with advanced social engineering and
more basic malware. For example, analyzing a FinFisher
sample targeted against Bahraini activists [38] with the
TTI, produces an overall TTI score that is dependent on
the social targeting aspect, even though the malware is
very technically advanced. In this case, the FinFisher attack scores 4.0 on the TTI (base targeting score of 2 with
a technical multiplier of 2). Although the email used
in the attack references the name and organization of a
real journalist, the content is poorly customized, and has
attributes that look questionable. However, the technical sophistication of the malware is advanced earning it
a score of 2 due to multiple advanced protection techniques, including a custom-written virtualized packer,
MBR modiﬁcation, and rootkit functionality. The sample
also uses multiple minor forms of protection, including
at least half a dozen anti-debugging tricks. Even though
the technical multiplier is the maximum value, the overall TTI score is only 4.0 due to the low targeting base
value. FinFisher is only effective if it is surreptitiously
installed on a users’ computer. If the malware is delivered through an email attachment, infection is only successful if the user opens the malicious ﬁle. The advanced
nature of this malware will cause the overall score to increase quickly with improved targeting, but as it still requires user intervention, this threat scores lower overall
than attacks with highly targeted social engineering using less sophisticated malware.
Similar ﬁndings can also be observed in attacks using
DaVinci RCS developed by Italy-based company Hacking Team against activists and independent media groups
from the United Arab Emirates and Morocco [36]. While
the malware used in these publicly reported attacks is
10

536 23rd USENIX Security Symposium

USENIX Association

technically sophisticated, the social engineering lures
employed are poorly customized for the targets resulting in a 4.0 TTI score (targeting base value 2, technical
multiplier 2).
These results support the idea that different threat actors have varying focuses and levels of resources, and
as a result, different methodologies for attacks. For example, the majority of malware submitted by our study
groups appear to be from adversaries that have in-house
malware development capabilities and the capacity to
organize and implement targeted malware campaigns.
These adversaries are spending signiﬁcant effort on social engineering, but generally do not use technically
advanced malware. Conversely, the adversaries using
FinFisher and DaVinci RCS have bought these products
rather than develop malware themselves. However, while
the FinFisher and RCS samples are technically sophisticated pieces of malware, the attacks we analyzed are not
sophisticated in terms of social engineering tactics.

how CSOs can protect themselves against email-based
targeted malware.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that moving towards cloud-based
platforms (e.g., Google Docs) instead of relying on email attachments would prevent more than 95% of the
e-mail malware seen by 2 out of 3 Tibetan groups that
had more than 50 e-mail submissions.
Further, our results highlight the potential for lowercost user education initiatives to guard against sophisticated social engineering attacks, rather than high cost
technical solutions. This observation stems from the fact
that much of the malware we observe is not technically
sophisticated, but rather relies on social engineering to
deliver its payload by convincing users to open malicious
attachments or links. Other studies [35, 36, 38] that have
revealed the use of commercial malware products against
CSOs and journalists have shown that many of these
cases also rely on duping users into opening malicious
e-mail attachments or social engineered instant messaging conversations. These incidents show that even advanced targeted malware requires successful exploitation
of users through social engineering tactics.
User education can be a powerful tool against the
kinds of targeted attacks we observed in this study. Indeed, the Tibetan community has taken an active approach with campaigns that urge Tibetan users to not
send or open attachments and suggests alternative cloud
based options such as Google Docs and Dropbox for
sharing documents [53]. We have also engaged the Tibetan groups in a series of workshops to introduce training curriculum which draws on examples submitted by
organizations participating in our study. We have also
provided them with technical background to identify suspicious e-mail headers and how to use free services to
check the validity of suspicious links in e-mail messages.
The mitigation strategies presented here are focused
on email vectors and do not consider all of the possible
attacks these groups may face. We highlight these strategies in particular because the majority of groups in our
study identiﬁed document-based targeted malware as a
high priority information security concern. The adversaries behind these attacks are highly motivated and will
likely adapt their tactics as users change their behaviors.
For example, it is plausible that if every user in a particular community began to avoid opening attachments and
document-based malware infected fewer targets, attackers may move on to vectors such as waterhole attacks or
attacks on cloud document platforms to ﬁll the gap. User
education and awareness raising activities need to be ongoing efforts that are informed by current research on the
state of threats particular communities are experiencing.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of user education efforts
in at risk communities and corresponding reactions from
attackers is required to understand the dynamics between

Limitations of TTI

While the Targeted Threat Index gives insight into the
distribution of how sophisticated threats are, we are still
in the process of evaluating and reﬁning it through interactions with the groups in our study and inclusion of
more sophisticated threats observed in related investigations in our lab. Average TTI scores in our dataset may
be skewed due to the self-reporting method we use in the
study. Very good threats are less likely to be noticed and
reported while being sent to far fewer people, and lowquality emails are much more likely to be sent in bulk
and stand out. It is also possible that individuals in different groups may be more diligent in submitting samples,
which could affect between group comparisons. We are
more interested, however, in worst-case (highest) scores
and not in comparing the average threat severity between
organizations.
Finally, this metric is calculated based on the technical
sophistication of the payload, not on the speciﬁc exploit.
There is currently no method to modify the TTI score in
a way similar to the temporal metrics used by the CVSS
metric. A temporal metric could be added to increase
the ﬁnal TTI value for 0-day vulnerabilities, or possibly
to reduce the score for exploits that are easily detectable
due to a public and well-known generation script, e.g.
Metasploit [2].

Related Work

There is a wide body of literature on ﬁltering and detection methods for spam [27,42,45,52,70,71] and phishing
emails and websites [12, 34, 39, 69]. Attention has also
been given to evaluating user behavior around phishing
attacks and techniques for evading them [6, 30, 33]. By
comparison research on detecting email vectors used for
targeted malware attacks is limited. A notable exception is [4, 5], which uses threat and recipient features
with a random forest classiﬁer to detect targeted malicious emails in a dataset from a large Fortune 500 company. Other work has focused on imporoving detection
of documents (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Ofﬁce) with embedded malicious code [13, 51, 57]
Another area of research explores methods for modeling the stages of targeted attacks and using these models to develop defenses. Guira and Wang [19] propose
a conceptual attack model called the attack pyramid to
model targeted attacks and identify features that can be
detected at the various stages. Hutchins, Cloppert and
Amin, [24] use a kill chain model to track targeted attack campaigns and inform defensive strategies.
Metrics have been developed to characterize security
vulnerabilities and their severity [7, 41, 50]. The industry standard is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [17], which uses three metric groups for
characterizing vulnerabilities and their impacts. These
groups are: base metric group (the intrinsic and fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and user environments), temporal metric
group (characteristics of a vulnerability that change over
time but not among user environments) and environmental metric group (characteristics of a vulnerability that
are relevant and unique to a particular user’s environment). The CVSS is a widely adopted metric, but only
rates technical vulnerabilities. Targeted attacks rely on a
user action of opening a malicious attachment or visiting
a malicious link to successfully compromise a system.
Therefore, the sophistication of message lures and other
social engineering tactics are an important part of determining the severity of a targeted attack. Systems like the
CVSS cannot address this contextual component.
Our study makes the following contributions to the
literature. Previous studies of targeted attacks against
CSOs usually focus on particular incidents or campaigns
and do not include longitudinal observations of attacks
against a range of CSO targets. While standards exist
for rating the sophistication of technical vulnerabilities
and research has been done on detecting targeted malware attacks and modeling campaigns, there is no scoring system that considers both the sophistication of mal-

Conclusions

Our study provides an in-depth look at targeted malware
threats faced by CSOs. We ﬁnd that considering the
technical sophistication of these threats alone is insufﬁcient and that educating users about social engineering tactics used by adversaries can be a powerful tool
for improving the security of these organizations. Our
results point to simple steps groups can take to protect
themselves from document-based targeted malware such
as shifting to cloud-based document platforms instead
of relying on attachments which can contain exploits.
Further research is needed to measure the effectiveness
of education strategies for changing user behaviour and
how effective these efforts are in mitigation of documentbased malware for CSOs. Further work is also required
in monitoring how attackers adapt tactics in response to
observed behavioural changes in targeted communities.
In ongoing work we are continuing our collection of emails and NIDS alerts as well as monitoring other attacks
against these groups (e.g., waterhole attacks and DoS attacks) to understand how threats vary based on their delivery mechanism. We are also working to extend our
methodology to more diverse CSO communities such as
those in Latin America, Africa, and other underreported
regions to better document the politically motivated digital threats they may be experiencing.

Examples of targeted e-mails

In this section, we provide speciﬁc examples of e-mails
that would be assigned targeting scores described in Section 4.2.2.

Targeting Score 1 (Targeted Not customized). The email in Figure 6 was sent to Tibet group 1. The message
content and sender are vague and do not relate to the interest of the group. The attachment is a word document
implanted with malware. The lack of relevant information in this message gives it a score of 1 (targeted, not
customized).

Targeting Score 2 (Targeted, Poorly Customized).
The e-mail in Figure 7 was sent to Tibet group 1. It references Tibetan self-immolations which is an issue of interest to the group. However, the sender does not appear to
be from a real person or organization. The message content is terse and does not referenced information that can
be externally validated. Therefore this message scores a
2 (targeted, poorly customized).

Dear [Redacted]
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Cheng Li from John L. Thornton China
Center of Brookings. I will attend an
annual meeting on Religious Research
with CIIS in Shanghai next week, and
plan to take the chance to visit Tibet.
Attached is a list of tibetans who have
self-immolated from 2009 which my assistant
prepared for me, but i am not sure of its
accuracy. Would you please have a look
and make necessary corrections. I will be
really much appreciated if you could do me
the favor and offer some more information
about the latest happenings inside tibet.

Tashi Delek.
Please find the attachment of the activity
report of Tibetan Career Centre, Bylakuppe
with this mail. As I was asked to send
this activity report to your office.
Thank you.
Regards,
Palden Sangpo, Consultant.

Figure 9: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 4

Targeting Score 3 (Targeted Customized).
The email in Figure 8 was sent to Tibet group 2. On the surface it appears to be a professional e-mail from “Palden
Sangpo” a consultant at the Tibet Career Centre. The
e-mail sender address and signature reference accurate
contact details that can be easily veriﬁed through an Internet search. However, the e-mail headers reveal the
purported e-mail sender address is fraudulent and the
actual sender was albano_kuqo@gmx.com. The e-mail
generally addresses the organization rather than the individual recipient. Therefore this message scores a 3 (targeted, customized).

this message gives it a score of 4 (targeted, personalized).
Targeting Score 5 (Targeted Highly Personalized).
Targeting scores of 5 (targeted, highly personalized) require reference to internal information to the target organization that could not be obtained through open sources.
Examples of messages scoring at this level include an
e-mail that purported to come from a funder of China
Group 3 that provided details of an upcoming meeting
the group actually had scheduled with the funder. In
another example, Tibet Group 2 and Tibet Group 3 received separate e-mails that contained speciﬁc personal
details about a South African group’s visit to Dharamsala, India that appear to have been repurposed from a
real private communication. The malicious attachment
contained an authentic travel itinerary, which would be
displayed after the user opened the document. The private information used in these messages suggest that the
attackers performed signiﬁcant reconnaissance of these
groups and likely obtained the information through prior
compromise.

Targeting Score 4 (Targeted Personalized). The email in Figure 9 was sent to Tibet group 1. It is directly
addressed to the director of the group and appears to
come from Mr. Cheng Li, a prominent China scholar
based at the Brookings Institute. The e-mail address
is made to appear to be from Mr. Cheng Li, but from
an AOL account (chengli.brookings@aol.com) that was
registered by the attackers. The message asks the recipient for information on recent Tibetan self-immolations.
