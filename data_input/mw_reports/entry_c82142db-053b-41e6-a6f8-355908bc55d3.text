As you’ve seen there have been a number of reports (Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, Trend
Micro, Symantec, Volexity, Huntress) of a supply chain compromise of 3CX, which produces
VOIP phone software.
Below we have performed a quick triage forensic investigation of a system we have installed
the backdoored installer on. We have also supplied Yara rules for the components under a
friendly Apache License (at the bottom) to help you hunt for compromised systems.
Note that our data-set will be missing data you will find on a real compromised system, as
the download chain (from Github) is now broken due to a successful taken down request. We
deployed the final stage credential theft tool (d3dcompiler_47.dll) manually via rundll32
calling each available exported module. There is also a sleep function to delay the secondary
payload. So results may vary a bit from what you will find on a real system!
We have performed the analysis of the system using Cado Response but the results and
approach should be transferable.
Installing 3CX
We installed a known-compromised version of 3CX (3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416.msi). After
the installation completed successfully, Windows defender detected a malicious component
(ffmpeg.dll) as Win64/SamScissors:

1/7

Which you can see in the Windows Defender event logs as expected:

2/7

Looking down in the timeline, we see a suspicious file being created on disk (dcwfzkme.sys)

Which we can see on disk:

3/7

However, looking up the hash shows that this is actually a part of Windows Defender’s
legitimate execution – this is just part of how Microsoft’s Boot Time Removal Tool (btr.sys)
operates and is a random name. So – let’s ignore that one!
So – let’s disable Defender and reinstall…
Post Installation
One obvious thing is ffmpeg.dll as discussed and identified already, now viewable on disk:

4/7

Browsing to the folder level of ffmpeg.dll, we see a few other key files:

Ffmpeg.dll we have spoken about and is used to side-load encoded data from the other file
in the folder – d3dcompiler_47.dll.

5/7

Update.exe is used to update the application, and has been seen pulling down the
compromised version.
Whilst the analysis above has been performed on a dead disk (in this case for speed an
isolated EC2 system) we can also perform a live collection which shows the open files for the
3CX application at the time of collection:

For now that’s it – I was hoping to show the forensic artefacts showing the credential stealing
but it hasn’t been executed in this environment.
