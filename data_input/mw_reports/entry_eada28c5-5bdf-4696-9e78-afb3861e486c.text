Summary

In this research note, we analyze an espionage campaign targeting Hong Kong democracy activists. Two new malware families are
used in this campaign that we name UP007 and SLServer.

The UP007 malware family was previously observed by Arbor Security Emergency Response Team (ASERT) in the report
“Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger,” which analyzes a set of samples that were hosted on the national level electoral

commission of Myanmar (Burma): the Myanmar Union Election Commission. One of the samples analyzed was described as

“unknown malware”, which we call UP007 based on an identiﬁer in the malware’s network trafﬁc. In a report released today, ASERT
describes a series of campaigns targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese interests, which also includes details on the same
UP007 sample we analyze.

A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report includes analysis of the SLServer sample we analyze (PwC refers to the family as

SunOrcal). We refer to the malware as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the ﬁle. These previous reports collected samples from
VirusTotal. We received the original email lure and samples used in the campaign from a targeted source, and found that both
UP007 and SLServer were sent to targets in the same attack.

This research note builds on previous reporting by more closely examining UP007 and SLServer, variations of these samples found
“in the wild”, and the connections between these attacks and other campaigns. Previous reports have shown overlap in the tactics,
techniques, and procedures used in this campaign in other operations targeting groups in Burma, Hong Kong, and the Tibetan

community. We speculate that either a single threat actor is targeting these groups or some level of formal or informal resource
sharing is occurring between the operators behind the campaigns.

Espionage Campaign Targeting Hong Kong Activists

In the week prior to the January 2016 Taiwanese General Election, Hong Kong-based pro-democracy activists received a targeted

email purporting to come from a Taiwanese non-proﬁt organization with information about the upcoming election. The email included
值
a Google Drive link to a RAR archive ﬁle: “2016總統選舉⺠情中⼼預測 .rar”, which translates to “Predictive Forecast from Centre
of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections.rar”.

Figure 1: Targeting email sent to Hong Kong democracy activists

Translated Email Text:
To recipients: Jinshen Tu, Zhifeng Huang, and Xiuxian Zhang. The 2016 general election enters its crucial ﬁnal 10 days, and 73 electoral
districts conclude their voting (1041229); Centre of Public Sentiment’s predicted forecast in the 2016 presidential elections (104.12.28).
The 2016 Election enters its crucial ﬁnal 10 days. On the 6th, Ing-wen Tsai, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) candidate, called on
DPP supporters to consolidate their votes. She warned that the intense internal competition within the DPP had caused people to be
worried about a splitting of the votes, potentially leading to the loss of the 15th and 16th seats.
The election day is on the 16th. Besides the presidential election, there is also the legislative election which includes district seats and
non-district seats. There are 34 non-district seats in total, of which the DPP won 13 during the last election. Given the higher degree of
support this time, the DPP should be able to secure 16 seats. But as the New Power Party’s (NPP) inﬂuence and support grows, it might
threaten the DPP.
In order to promote support for non-district legislators, the DPP Central Standing Committee organized a campaign event this afternoon.
The chairwoman of the DPP, Ing-wen Tsai, said there are only ten days left before the election, and the three things she worried the most
about were: 1) ballot bribery, which may cause DPP’s loss in certain swing areas; 2) whether young people would return home to vote on
Jan 16th; 3) vote splitting that may lead good candidates to lose in non-district legislative elections.

Delivery Mechanism
We have observed the use of Google Drive links as a delivery vector in recent campaigns targeting Tibetan organizations. In these
campaigns, Google Drive links were used to send malware and phishing pages. We have also seen the tactic used in recent
espionage campaigns targeting an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. The prior use of Google Drive as a
delivery vector against Tibetan groups is signiﬁcant, as Tibetan groups are promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending ﬁle
attachments to prevent infection from document-based malware.

Examining the RAR Archive
Within the linked RAR archive, the top three directories contain a mix of malicious and benign documents, as well as shortcuts that
run two executables that are deeply nested within hidden directories in the archive. The ﬁle structure of this archive is shown in
Figure 2.

Figure 2: File structure of delivered RAR archive.
The top level directory of this archive contains a benign Word document named 聲明.doc, which translates to “Statement.doc”. The
text of this document is written in Chinese and is related to the Taiwanese election.

Table 1: Sample overview
These samples, when executed, create two separate infection chains. The lack of emphasis on tricking targets into running a single
malicious ﬁle is interesting. We are unsure as to why the operators chose to deploy two separate infection chains within the same
delivery mechanism. It is also unclear why the benign document was included at the top directory, as this would require more user
interaction for a compromise to be successful. It is possible that this mixture of benign and malicious ﬁles is intended to lull the
targets into a false sense of security.
值
Within the archive there are two Microsoft Word ﬁles: 2016總統選舉⺠情中⼼預測 .doc (translation: “Predictive forecast from
Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections”) and 73個⽴委選區選情研判.doc (translation: “Election polling of 73
legislative electoral districts”). Despite having different ﬁlenames, they are the same ﬁle (MD5 hash:
09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). This infected document was analyzed in the recent PwC report and the malware family
was named SunOrcal by the researchers. In this report we take a closer look at the two nested executables: fzyy.exe and
wzget.exe and the two separate infection chains they produce.

UP007 Malware Family
The fzyy.exe executable is a dropper responsible for creating multiple ﬁles and starting this particular infection chain. When the
ﬁle is run it creates the following ﬁles in the directory: %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\

These ﬁles are all initially stored as resources withinfzyy.exe. Some of the ﬁles are stored in encoded form whilemaindll.dll
is stored as a packed executable. When writing the ﬁles to disk, the dropper will decode and write the ﬁles stored in encoded form.
In addition the infection chain will check multiple registry keys before writing maindll.dll.
The keys largely seem to check for the presence of popular Chinese antivirus products:360 Security, Kingsoft Antivirus, Rising AV,
Jiangmin, and Micropoint as well as a popular free antivirus product Avira. Interestingly, in this instance, even if the registry keys are
present, maindll.dll will still be written and the infection chain will still continue. The registry keys that are checked by the infection
chain are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3: Registry keys that fzyy.exe checks for before writing maindll.dll
Once all the ﬁles are created, conhost.exe starts, loads SBieDll.dll, then ultimately loads maindll.dll and the ﬁnal
payload, which we have named UP007 (dll2.xor) due to an identiﬁer in the network trafﬁc. The primary function of UP007
appears to be to log keystrokes to the %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp\keylog\ directory and send them to a remote
server.
UP007 uses Windows Sockets to communicate with its command and control server (C2). While doing so, it sends a hardcoded
HTTP header disguised as Microsoft Update trafﬁc. This is likely an attempt to escape notice by casual inspection of network trafﬁc.
On connection, UP007 downloads another payload directly from the C2 server. This secondary payload we have named
“DownLoad” given the way it identiﬁes itself in the trafﬁc with the C2 server. This secondary payload is injected into memory. The
initial network trafﬁc observed from the UP007 sample is seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Network capture of the initial communication by UP007.
Once the entire payload is received from the C2 server, UP007 sends basic system information such as operating system version,
IP address, and username and the C2 responds with a “READY” announcement (see Figure 4).

Figure 4: Network capture of the infected system sending system information to the C2.
The secondary payload (DownLoad) initiates its own separate TCP connection with the C2 server. A sample of the network trafﬁc of
this secondary payload is seen in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Network capture of DownLoad connection to the C2.
Unfortunately, even though the connection with the C2 was established, we did not observe any further activity from this payload.
However, DownLoad’s strings show references to the following:
this is cmd
this is Desktop

It is possible these are in reference to additional components or capabilities of the malware. Further analysis is required to
determine the function of these components.

UP007 Command and Control Infrastructure
The command and control server for the UP007 sample is hosted on Hong Kong provider New World Telecom at the IP address
59.188.12[.]123. Passive DNS data from PassiveTotal indicates that the domain name yeaton.xicp[.]net pointed to this IP
from January 8 2016 to March 19 2016. In their recent report ASERT notes that the domain: yeaton.xicp[.]net was used to
advertise a Chinese VPN service in 2012. However, as ASERT explains given the long period between the use of the domain for
advertising and the recent threat activity the past uses of the domain may not be related to the threat actors.

UP007 Samples and Variations
In November 2013, an exploit document (MD5: 983333e2c878a62d95747c36748198f0)
was uploaded to various malware sites with
曝光
构设置和⼈员名单提前
the ﬁlename 中国国家安全委员会机
.docx (which translates to “Chinese National Security Council’s
Institutional Structure and Member list”) and 131106 minutes.docx. Instead of receiving the Stage 2 binary in the C2 protocol as
in the recent UP007 sample, the November 2013 sample directly requested ok.exe via an HTTP GET request to
103.19.85[.]89. The ok.exe sample communicated with tenday.mysecondarydns[.]com which resolved to
103.19.85[.]89. It was signed with a certiﬁcate with serial number04 DE 6E CB 4B A2 A5 54 2B 5E 0C 71 EE FD 2A
AA.
One year later, in November 2014, another instance of the UP007 dropper (MD5:e2ac89b5c820fc598b92a635a7d8bc33) signed
with a certiﬁcate using the serial number 3A 72 A8 34 FB EC E5 4F A5 E5 2F 67 BA 63 4D CAwas uploaded to
VirusTotal. According to VirusTotal, this ﬁle was observed being hosted at http://103.19.85[.]89/chin.jpg. The ﬁnal
payload was designed to communicate with the same host for command and control.
In August 2015, an instance of the UP007 dropper (MD5: 639c7239f40d95f677a99abb059e8338) signed with the same certiﬁcate
(Serial: 5D 11 78 4F B8 17 65 02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9
) as fzyy.exe was uploaded to VirusTotal spotted in the
wild as http://hkemail.f3322[.]org/32.zip. This sample communicated with hk2[.]upupdate[.]cn which resolved to
103.27.108[.]122 at the time of analysis.
The samples detailed in Table 4 were identiﬁed by import hash and other structural similarities related to the UP007 dropper. They
were uploaded to VirusTotal by the same submitter on November 14, 2014 and February 27, 2015. They were signed with the same
3A 72...4D CA and 5D 11...E1 A9 certiﬁcates, respectively.

SLServer Malware Family
The SLServer sample we received was also recently analyzed and reported byPwC. It was presented in an overview of threat
actors making use of the recent Taiwanese presidential election in email lures to entice targets to open malicious documents. As
noted by PwC, this ﬁle is a self-extracting archive ultimately responsible for downloading a binary from a website that was likely
compromised. Like PwC, we were unable to obtain the ﬁnal Keyainst.exe binary due to the behaviour of the C2 during the time of
analysis.
Based on common behavioural characteristics and shared C2 it appears the downloaded ﬁle analyzed by PwC wasMD5:
e5e7dcbda781dd0bf5f5da3cccdb094d. This sample was referred to as SunOrcal by PwC. This name was based on a folder
misspelling. We refer to the malware family as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the ﬁle (see Figure 6).

Figure 6: SLServer dialog resource.
Another recently observed instance of this malware found on VirusTotal (MD5:cfcd2a90e87156e1a811f9c7b0051002) was
designed to communicate with the same C2 server and contains the following debug path:
e:\Working\SVNProject\SLServer\SLServer2.0\release\SLServer.pdb

Interestingly, according to VirusTotal, the previously mentioned UP007 dropper fzyy.exe was also observed hosted as wthk.txt
at the same URL as this downloaded SLServer sample. The precise timeframes during which these samples were hosted and
changed remains unknown. Table 6 shows the timestamps of their initial upload to VirusTotal.

SLServer – Possible Second Stage

The SLServer sample (MD5: e5e7dcbda781dd0bf5f5da3cccdb094d) calls “FunctionWork” from a DLL:

On VirusTotal we discovered a ﬁle named javaupdata.dll (MD5: <7332245f67b6b8a256ab22a6496b4536), which exports a
function by the same name. Strings in the SLServer sample also reference a ﬁle by this name. When executed, this DLL contacts
210.61.12[.]153 using SSL. This host is the same one pointed to by the SLServer’s C2 domain,safetyssl.securitycenters[.]com. Interestingly, while the 210.61.12[.]153 host did not respond to the SLServer connections during analysis
time, the host did accept the SSL connections from javaupdata.dll. Further analysis of this ﬁle is ongoing.

SLServer Command and Control Infrastructure
The SLServer C2 server: safetyssl.security-centers[.]com resolved to the IP address: 210.61.12[.]153 at the time of
analysis. This IP is hosted in Taiwan on the hosting provider Chunghwa Telecom, speciﬁcally their Data Communication Business
Group offering. It appears to host the site of a Taiwanese auto parts manufacturer, Yowjung Autoparts. This site may have been
either compromised or copied from a legitimate source.
The domain name security-centers.com was registered on September 11 2015 by the e-mails: janmillerdomain@googlemail[.]com and an_ardyth@123mail[.]org. Using Passive DNS data we ﬁnd the following subdomains
were used in the time period after domain registration:
safetyssl.security-centers[.]com
computer.security-centers[.]com
security-centers[.]com
www.security-centers[.]com

The domain computer.security-centers[.]com was a C2 server previously reported by ASERT related to a sample of the
Trochilus RAT analyzed in the report. ASERT retrieved that sample from the compromised Myanmar Union Election Commission
website. The other subdomains (www and the the top level security-centers[.]com) are likely the default IP addresses for
GoDaddy registered domains. The hosting information for this infrastructure is presented in the Figure 7.

SLServer Samples and Variations
We discovered three additional SLServer samples using VirusTotal. We list the hash, submission time, as well as C2 domains
associated with the sample in Table 7.

Recent Campaign Connections
In January 2016, Arbor Networks released a report titled “Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger” in which they discuss a series of
six RAR ﬁles hosted on the Myanmar election commission website on 20 October 2015. The focus of the report was on the
discovery of the new Trochilus RAT. However, one of the RAR ﬁles was noted as unknown malware. This sample (SecurityPatch-Update.exe, MD5: 82896b68314d108141728a4112618304) is also UP007, signed with the 5D 11 78 4F B8 17 65
02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9 certiﬁcate and conﬁgured to communicate with 59.188.12[.]123 directly over port 8008,
identical to fzyy.exe mentioned above. In this instance, if any of the previously discussed registry keys were present, the sample
will execute the dropped runas.exe binary. Given this execution, nvsvc.exe is likely also an older component. As discussed
above the UP007 sample we analyzed shares the same C2 (computer.security-centers[.]com) as the Trochilus RAT
sample reported by ASERT.
In November 2015, Palo Alto Networks reported on a newly discovered trojan referred to asBookworm. They revealed a campaign
focused on the targeting of government entities in Thailand. The campaign used a malware family known as FFRAT, and the sample
described in the report connected to the domain hkemail.f3322[.]org for command and control. In August 2015, the same
domain was reportedly used to host an instance of UP007 as well.
Finally, the relationship between the SLServer C2 www.olinaodi[.]com and our previous research into theSurtr malware family was
highlighted by PwC through the overlap in the toucan6712@163[.]com registrant. We tracked malware campaigns using the
Surtr family that have targeted Tibetan organizations since 2013.

Conclusion
This latest espionage campaign against Hong Kong activists appears to be connected to a broader set of targets, and operations.
The recent detailed reporting by ASERT makes it clear that the UP007 malware family has been found in previous campaigns
targeting Burmese interests. In addition, the campaigns share some C2 infrastructure with previous operations against targets in
Thailand and the Tibetan community. The domain registration connections between SLServer infrastructure and Surtr infrastructure
also suggests some level of potential coordination between campaigns targeting Hong Kong groups and the Tibetan community.
Despite these connections, it is unclear if these campaigns are being conducted by the same threat actor.
We cannot exclude the possibility that distinct operators have a degree of sharing of tools and infrastructure. Alternatively, security
researcher Ned Moran has articulated a concept of a “digital quartermaster,” to refer to an actor that supplies threat infrastructure
and malware development resources to multiple groups. While these scenarios are plausible, we do not have enough data to
properly assess these competing hypotheses, or to make conclusive statements about the identity of the threat actors.
What is clear from our analysis is that civil society groups across Asia continue to be targeted by persistent and organized cyber
espionage campaigns. Civil society often lack the resources and awareness to defend against these operations and closer attention
to the threats they face is needed.
