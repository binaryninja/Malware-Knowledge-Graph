Domain Names Were in Part Used to Control a Cobalt Strike Software
Tool that the Actors Implanted on Victim Networks
WASHINGTON – On May 28, pursuant to court orders issued in the Eastern District of
Virginia, the United States seized two command-and-control (C2) and malware distribution
domains used in recent spear-phishing activity that mimicked email communications from the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This malicious activity was the subject
of a May 27 Microsoft security alert, titled “New sophisticated email-based attack from
Nobelium,” and a May 28 FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency joint
cybersecurity advisory.
The Department’s seizure of the two domains was aimed at disrupting the malicious actors’
follow-on exploitation of victims, as well as identifying compromised victims. However, the
actors may have deployed additional backdoor accesses between the time of the initial
compromises and last week’s seizures.

“Last week’s action is a continued demonstration of the Department’s commitment to
proactively disrupt hacking activity prior to the conclusion of a criminal investigation,” said
Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department’s National Security
Division. “Law enforcement remains an integral part of the U.S. government’s broader
disruption efforts against malicious cyber-enabled activities, even prior to arrest, and we will
continue to evaluate all possible opportunities to use our unique authorities to act against
such threats.”
“Cyber intrusions and spear-phishing email attacks can cause widespread damage
throughout affected computer networks, and can result in significant harm to individual
victims, government agencies, NGOs, and private businesses,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Raj
Parekh for the Eastern District of Virginia. “As demonstrated by the court-authorized seizure
of these malicious domains, we are committed to using all available tools to protect the
public and our government from these worldwide hacking threats.”
“Friday’s court-authorized domain seizures reflect the FBI Washington Field Office’s
continued commitment to cyber victims in our region,” said Assistant Director in Charge
Steven M. D’Antuono of the FBI’s Washington Field Office. “These actions demonstrate our
ability to quickly respond to malicious cyber activities by leveraging our unique authorities to
disrupt our cyber adversaries.”
“The FBI remains committed to disrupting this type of malicious cyber activity targeting our
federal agencies and the American public,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the
FBI’s Cyber Division. “We will continue to use all of the tools in our toolbelt and leverage our
domestic and international partnerships to not only disrupt this type of hacking activity but to
impose risk and consequences upon our adversaries to combat these threats.”
On or about May 25, malicious actors commenced a wide-scale spear-phishing campaign
leveraging a compromised USAID account at an identified mass email marketing company.
Specifically, the compromised account was used to send spear-phishing emails, purporting to
be from USAID email accounts and containing a “special alert,” to thousands of email
accounts at over one hundred entities.
Upon a recipient clicking on a spear-phishing email’s hyperlink, the victim computer was
directed to download malware from a sub-domain of theyardservice[.]com. Using that initial
foothold, the actors then downloaded the Cobalt Strike tool to maintain persistent presence
and possibly deploy additional tools or malware to the victim’s network. The actors’ instance
of the Cobalt Strike tool received C2 communications via other subdomains of
theyardservice[.]com, as well as the domain worldhomeoutlet[.]com. It was those two
domains that the Department seized pursuant to the court’s seizure order.
The National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and the
United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia are investigating this matter
in coordination with the FBI’s Cyber Division and Washington Field Office.
