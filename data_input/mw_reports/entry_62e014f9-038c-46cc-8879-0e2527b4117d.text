StrongPity APT Extends Global Reach with New
Infrastructure

December 30, 2020

StrongPity/Promethium APT, also known as APT-C-41, has been active since at least 2012.
It was first publicly reported in October 2016, after cyberattacks against users in Belgium and
Italy in which it used the watering-hole attack technique to deliver malicious versions of
WinRAR and the TrueCrypt file encryption software.
The group chiefly uses Truvasys, a first-stage malware that has been employed in several
attack campaigns with trojanized common computer utilities, including WinRAR, WinUtils,
TrueCrypt, or SanDisk. In each of its campaigns, the Truvasys malware has emerged with
evolved features.
Researchers described StrongPity as having the distinctive features of an APT unit that
utilizes zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack tools to invade victims for
espionage. After the 2016 attack, the threat actor has expanded its TTPs to include watering
hole attacks and mass phishing email campaigns.
Here is the timeline of StrongPity APT group starting from 2016.

Figure 1. Timeline of the StrongPity APT attacks
In 2016, APT-C-41 was mostly targeting countries like Italy and Belgium. However, its victims
are now widespread across Europe, Northern Africa, Canada, and Asia. Focused on finding
and exfiltrating data from infected machines, the StrongPity APT group runs a series of
counterfeit websites that pretend to offer an array of software tools. These utilities provide
trojanized versions of legitimate applications.
While tracking the StrongPity APT group’s campaigns, we discovered that it targets through
Trojanized Partition Find and Mount software utility along with updated C&C infrastructure. In
this blog, we have highlighted the technical details of the latest cyberattacks by the group.
The high-level process flow of the StrongPity malware installation is shown in the figure
below.

Figure 2: High-level execution flow diagram
The high-level execution flow of the StrongPity infection is as follows:
It starts with the APT actor employing the watering hole attack or Phishing email to
deliver trojanized Partition Find and Mount software utility on the victims.
The Trojanized installer drops multiple malware components in the %temp%\ndaData
folder along with configuration files, as shown below.

The Launcher component is responsible for executing the Exfiltrate module, which runs
another File searcher component.
The File searcher component enumerates system drives and looks for target files with
specific extensions. The list of extensions is embedded in the StrongPity payload.
If the files are found in the victim’s machine, it will be copied into a temporary zip
archive. After completion of adding the files to the archive, it splits into hidden .sft
encrypted files.
These hidden .sft files are sent to the C&C server through a POST request and are
then removed from the disk-based on further C&C command. The Exfiltrate module
has commands to delete the .sft files after being sent to the hacker C&C server, as
seen in the figure below.

Figure 4: Payload module with the deletion command
Upon execution of the trojanized installer, it extracts and drops encrypted payloads, which is
part of its resource section, as shown in the figure below

Figure 5: Encrypted payload in .rsrc section
StrongPity payloads such as the Launcher & Persistence component, Exfiltration &
Command Execution module, and the File Searcher component are extracted and dropped
in the %temp%\ndaData folder. The figure below shows the decryption routines as well as
decrypted payloads in the process memory.

Figure 6: Decrypted payload in the memory
The malware payload creates a mutex named “thUseiGpkMkPkFYrIOvKN” to mark its
existence on the victim’s system, as shown in the image below.

Figure 7: Creates Mutex function in the payload file
The Exfiltrate component has a hardcoded C&C URL, decoded in the memory as depicted in
the debugger image below. As seen in earlier variants, the Parse_ini_file.php is used as part
of the layer 1 communication and the functionality to get commands from the C&C server.

The network capture depicts multiple connection requests to the attacker layer 1 C&C server
(uppertrainingtool[.]com) as showcased in the Wireshark image below.

Conclusion:
The StrongPity APT group has suspected ties to state-sponsored campaigns and has the
ability to search and exfiltrate multiple files or documents from the victim’s machine. This
group uses a 3-layer C&C for thwarting forensic investigations and operates with fully
functional Trojanized popular tools.
