Asylum Ambuscade: State Actor Uses Compromised Private Ukrainian Military Emails to Target European
Governments and Refugee Movement

March 01, 2022 Michael Raggi, Zydeca Cass and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team

Key Takeaways

1/15

Proofpoint has identified a likely nation-state sponsored phishing campaign using a possibly
compromised Ukrainian armed service member’s email account to target European government
personnel involved in managing the logistics of refugees fleeing Ukraine.
The email included a malicious macro attachment which attempted to download a Lua-based malware
dubbed SunSeed.
The infection chain used in this campaign bears significant similarities to a historic campaign
Proofpoint observed in July 2021, making it likely the same threat actor is behind both clusters of
activity.
Proofpoint is releasing this report in an effort to balance accuracy with responsibility to disclose
actionable intelligence during a time of high-tempo conflict.

Overview
“Ambuscade: To attack suddenly and without warning from a concealed place”
Proofpoint researchers have identified a phishing campaign originating from an email address (ukr[.]net) that
appears to belong to a compromised Ukranian armed service member. This discovery comes on the heels
of alerts by the Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) and the State Service of
Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine about widespread phishing campaigns
targeting private email accounts of Ukrainian armed service members by ‘UNC1151’, which Proofpoint
tracks as part of TA445. The email observed by Proofpoint may represent the next stage of these attacks.
The email included a malicious macro attachment which utilized social engineering themes pertaining to the
Emergency Meeting of the NATO Security Council held on February 23, 2022. The email also contained a
malicious attachment which attempted to download malicious Lua malware named SunSeed and targeted
European government personnel tasked with managing transportation and population movement in Europe.
While Proofpoint has not definitively attributed this campaign to the threat actor TA445, researchers
acknowledge that the timeline, use of compromised sender addresses aligning with Ukrainian government
reports, and the victimology of the campaign align with published TA445 tactics to include the targeting and
collection around refugee movement in Europe.
Proofpoint assesses that, in light of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, actions by proxy actors like TA445 will
continue to target European governments to gather intelligence around the movement of refugees from
Ukraine and on issues of importance to the Russian government. TA445, which appears to operate out of
Belarus, specifically has a history of engaging in a significant volume of disinformation operations intended
to manipulate European sentiment around the movement of refugees within NATO countries. These
controlled narratives may intend to marshal anti-refugee sentiment within European countries and
exacerbate tensions between NATO members, decreasing Western support for the Ukrainian entities
involved in armed conflict. This approach is a known factor within the hybrid warfare model employed by the
Russian military and by extension that of Belarus.

Delivery
On February 24, 2022, Proofpoint detected an email originating from a ukr[.]net email address which was
sent to a European government entity. The email utilized the subject "IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED
24.02.2022" and included a macro enabled XLS file titled “list of persons.xlsx,” which was later determined
to deliver SunSeed malware. The social engineering lure utilized in this phishing campaign were very timely,
following a NATO Security Council meeting on February 23, 2022 and a news story about a Russian
government “kill list” targeting Ukrainians that began circulating in Western media outlets on February 21,
2022. The format of the subject included the date “24.02.2022” at the end of subject line and was
superficially similar to emails reported by the State Service of Special Communications and Information
Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) on February 25, 2022. This alert indicated that mass phishing campaigns
were targeting “Citizens’ e-mail addresses” in Ukraine. The timing of the Proofpoint observed campaign is
notable as it occurred within close proximity to the campaigns reported by Ukrainian state agencies.

Figure 2. CERT-UA reports of UNC1151 targeting private accounts of Ukrainian military personnel.
Open-source research on the sender email address identified the account on a Ukrainian public
procurement document for a Stihl lawn mower in 2016. The email account was listed as the contact address
on the purchase, while the customer was listed as “Військова частина А2622” or military unit A2622. This
title, as well as the address listed, appear to refer to a military barracks that houses a military unit in
“Чернігівська область” or the Chernihiv region of Ukraine. While Proofpoint has not definitively determined
that this detected campaign is aligned with the phishing campaigns reported by the Ukrainian government or

3/15

that this activity can be attributed to TA445, researchers assess that this may represent a continuation of the
campaigns that utilize compromised Ukrainian personal accounts of armed service members to target the
governments of NATO members in Europe.

Macro Enabled Attachments
The malicious XLS attachment observed in the email was laden with a simple but distinct macro. When
enabled, it executes a VB macro named “Module1” which creates a Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) object
invoking Windows Installer to call out to an actor-controlled staging IP and download a malicious MSI
package. It also sets a Microsoft document UILevel equal to “2” which specifies a user interface level of
“completely silent installation.” This hides all macro actions and network connections from the user. The
actor accesses the delivery IP via the Microsoft Installer InstallProduct method which is intended to obtain
an MSI install file from a URL, save it to a cached location, and finally begin installation of the MSI package.
Since the actor is utilizing an MSI package as an installer for a Lua-based malware, this method is well
suited to be deployed via a malicious macro-laden document delivered via phishing.

SunSeed Lua Malware Installation
Analysis of the actor-controlled delivery infrastructure identified an MSI package which installed a series of
Lua-based dependencies, executed a malicious Lua script that Proofpoint has dubbed SunSeed, and
established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup. This file, named
qwerty_setup.msi, was previously identified publicly by security researcher Colin Hardy in response to
Proofpoint’s initial content regarding this threat. The package installs 12 legitimate Lua dependencies, a
Windows Lua interpreter, a malicious Lua script (SunSeed), and a Windows shortcut LNK file for
persistence. Notably, the legitimate Windows Lua interpreter sppsvc.exe has been modified so it does not
print any output to the Windows Console. This is likely an effort to conceal the malware installation from the
infected user. All files, except for the LNK file, are installed to the folder C:\ProgramData\.security-soft\. The
LNK persistence script, which executes the SunSeed command “print.lua” via the Window Lua interpreter, is
saved to the directory C:\ProgramData\.security-soft\sppsvc.exe to be executed at startup. This executes
the malicious SunSeed Lua script “print.lua” that attempts to retrieve additional malicious Lua code from the
actor command and control (C2) server.
Legitimate Files and Lua Dependencies:
luacom.dll (LuaCom Library)

Figure 5. Asylum Ambuscade - Campaign Snapshot.
Proofpoint researchers observed several distinct and unusual aspects about the MSI package upon closer
inspection. The actor utilized the Japanese Shift-JIS code base, resulting in a Japanese language
installation message upon launching the MSI package. This may be a rudimentary false flag intended to
conceal the spoken language of the threat actor. Additionally, examination of the cryptography calls made by
the package during installation indicates that the MSI file appears to have been created using a dated
version of WiX Toolset version 3.11.0.1528. This is an open-source software that allows users to “build MSIs
without requiring additional software on a build server” from the command line. This version was last
updated in 2017 with a more recent update being pushed in 2019 and an entirely new version of the toolset
made available in May 2021.

SunSeed Malware Capabilities: A Lua Downloader
Based on decoding of the SunSeed print.lua malicious second stage payload script, it appears to be a
simple downloader which obtains the C Drive partition serial number from the host, appends to a URL
request via a Lua socket, consistently pings the C2 server for additional Lua code, and executes the code
upon receiving it within a response. At the time of analysis, Proofpoint did not receive additional Lua code
from the C2 server. However, researchers believe that this is likely intended to deliver subsequent stage
payloads to the infected host. Further attempts to decode the SunSeed Lua host included several notable
strings that may suggest a possible response from the actor-controlled server. These strings do not appear
to be part of the initial SunSeed script’s functionality in the absence of a C2 server response. Observed
string values include, but are not limited to:

8/15

“serial”
“string”
“luacom”
“CreateObject”
“Scripting.FileSystemObject”
“Drives”
“SerialNumber”
“socket.http”
“request”
“http://84.32.188[.]96/”
“ socket”
“sleep”

Command and Control
The SunSeed malware when executed issues GET requests over HTTP via port 80 using a Lua Socket. The
requests are issued to the C2 server every three seconds anticipating a response. The malware specifies
the user agent as “LuaSocket 2.0.2” and appends the infected target’s C Drive partition serial number to the
URI request. This is a unique decimal digit value assigned to a drive upon creation of the file system. It may
be an attempt by actors to track infected victims on the backend per their unique serial number. Additionally,
this may allow operators to be selective about which infections are issued a next stage payload response.
Based on the observed strings in the Lua script, researchers speculate that the server response may include
further malicious commands, or a Lua based installer code which is executed as a response to the SunSeed
payload, depending on the received serial identification number.

Victimology and Targeting
With the finite data set available to Proofpoint surrounding this campaign, limited conclusions can be drawn
regarding targeting. The Proofpoint-observed email messages were limited to European governmental
entities. The targeted individuals possessed a range of expertise and professional responsibilities. However,
there was a clear preference for targeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial
and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe. This campaign may
represent an attempt to gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement of funds,
supplies, and people within NATO member countries.

Attribution Remains Unclear
Several temporal and anecdotal indicators exist which suggest that this activity aligns with reported
campaigns by the threat actor TA445/UNC1151/Ghostwriter. However, Proofpoint has not yet observed
concrete technical overlaps which would allow us to definitively attribute this campaign to this actor. In
addition to the notable overlaps with Ukrainian government reported campaigns referenced previously, the
victimology of this campaign with prominent NATO governments being targeted and a possible focus on the
movements of refugees in NATO countries recalls historic motivations of TA445’s information operations
circa 2021. Specifically, the anti-migratory narratives disseminated by the group also referred to as
Ghostwriter during the 2021 migratory crisis in which Belarus intentionally funneled refugees to the Polish
border belies a possible connection between this 2022 campaign and TA445’s historic mandate. Mainly both
campaigns may indicate the weaponization of migrants and refugees of war through a hybrid information

9/15

warfare and targeted cyber-attack model. Researchers at Mandiant addressed these tactics by UNC1151’s
information operation team referred to as Ghostwriter (collectively TA445) in a recent presentation (12:17
time stamp), disclosing the existence of the group and attributing the activity to Belarus. Proofpoint also
notes that, in addition to the Asylum Ambuscade operation, in recent days researchers have detected TA445
credential harvesting activity that aligns with Mandiant’s description of this threat group to include the use of
GoPhish to deliver malicious email content. This activity appears distinct from the Asylum Ambuscade
campaign. Proofpoint is currently tracking the actor responsible for Asylum Ambuscade as distinct from
TA445 until a technical relationship can be further established.

Figure 9. Comparison of Asylum Ambuscade campaign and TA445 TTPs.
While Proofpoint has not definitively determined attribution at this time, researchers assess with moderate
confidence that this campaign and a historic campaign from July 2021 were conducted by the same threat
actor. The July 2021 campaign utilized a highly similar macro-laden XLS attachment to deliver MSI
packages that install a Lua malware script. Similarly, the campaign utilized a very recent government report
as the basis of the social engineering content and titled the malicious attachment “list of participants of the
briefing.xls.” In addition to the file name being quite similar to the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, the Lua
script created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of the infected
victim’s C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in both samples revealed that the
same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create the MSI packages. Finally, the macros in this
historic campaign utilized the identical technique as the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, using Windows
Installer to retrieve an MSI package from an actor-controlled IP resource and suppressing indications of
installation from the user. The July 2021 campaign targeted senior cyber security practitioners and
decisionmakers at private US-based companies, including those in the defense sector.

Conclusion: Balancing Accurate Reporting in a Timely Fashion
This activity, independent of attribution conclusions, represents an effort to target NATO entities with
compromised Ukrainian military accounts during an active period of armed conflict between Russia, its
proxies, and Ukraine. In publishing this report, Proofpoint seeks to balance the accuracy of responsible
reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence. The onset of hybrid conflict,
including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time
that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known
nation-state operators. However, these are issues that Proofpoint will continue to research while protecting
customers globally. Proofpoint invites additional details and input around any observed activity that aligns
with these reports. While the utilized techniques in this campaign are not groundbreaking individually, if
deployed collectively, and during a high tempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective. As
the conflict continues, researchers assess similar attacks against governmental entities in NATO countries
are likely. Additionally, the possibility of exploiting intelligence around refugee movements in Europe for
disinformation purposes is a proven part of Russian and Belarussian-state techniques. Being aware of this
threat and disclosing it publicly are paramount for cultivating awareness among targeted entities.
