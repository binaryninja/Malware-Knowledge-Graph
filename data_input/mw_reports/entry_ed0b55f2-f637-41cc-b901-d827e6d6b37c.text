Abstract
The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which Stuxnet can be characterized as a new
war, if at all. The cyber-attack is studied within the theoretical framework of Mary Kaldor’s
‘New and Old Wars’, where the case has been analysed through the perspective of both
conventional and modern wars. Stuxnet is the first cyber-attack that has managed to act in
complete secrete during a long period of time and causing its target physical destruction, while
hiding all the evidence that could lead to the malware. The significance with Stuxnet is not
merely based on its sophisticated operation but rather to the selection of its target, which is the
Iranian nuclear enrichment program. The cyber-attack has raised questions of vulnerability and
lack of securitization that the world faces in these situations. Nonetheless, it is rather difficult to
prepare and secure ourselves from such attacks, if we do not understand their nature.
After examining the aim, the actors involved and the method of Stuxnet, it becomes clear that
that the cyber-attack contain features from both old and new wars.

1. Introduction
Mankind have since the beginning of time fought with each other for various reasons, calculated
strategies to maximize their benefits and used numerous of tools to defeat their enemy.
Destruction, espionage and sabotage are common concepts in warfare and are as essential parts
of war today as they were over thousands of years ago. Nevertheless, there are significant
differences on the adaption of these approaches that have evolved over time.1
Causing destruction in a state and accessing valuable information through espionage, has usually
required crossing the enemy’s borders. Protecting territorial borders is therefore one of the most
fundamental elements of securing a state's existence as the borders work as a barrier between
themselves and potential threats.2 However, if the enemy can cause states severe destruction
without crossing their territory, the protection of borders, along with the understanding of the
threats we might face, must be reviewed.
Cyber-attacks have caused several damages on numerous countries in the recent decade and none
of these states were necessarily prepared for these attacks. In 2007 Estonia was the victim of a
wage of cyber-attacks, lasting for three weeks and targeting the Estonian government, Internet
infrastructure, banking and media3. Georgia faced similar cyber-attacks against their media and
some of their main communications channels in 20084. In 2009 China was accused of releasing a
cyber-spying program targeting over 100 countries and accessing valuable information.5
However, in 2010 a revolutionary cyber-attack took place and was later referred to as the world's
first digital weapon.6 Iran discovered in 2010 that their nuclear program had been attacked for at
least a year without their knowledge by a cyber worm, later known as Stuxnet. The cyber worm

aimed at destroying the uranium enrichment in Iran to limit the capabilities of their nuclear
program, and thus prevent a potential nuclear weapon.7 Even though several countries have been
victims to diverse cyber-attacks prior to the attacks against Iran in 2010, Stuxnet is argued to be
the beginning of a new war era.8

Research problem

Mary Kaldor argues that war has adapted a new character in the post-Cold war era. She
addresses several features that characterizes new wars, where one of the main targets is to
achieve political goals instead of attaining geographical territories, which is usually the aim of
conventional wars.9 Not to forget one of the key arguments of Kaldor's, which is that these wars
need to be understood within the context of globalization.
Numerous studies have been conducted on cyber-attacks and their relatively new role in
conflicts. There are several articles and researches about Stuxnet that discusses various aspects
and issues regarding the cyber worm. Some researchers, like Ronald C. Dodge, Lynn Futcher
(2013)10 and James Barret (2015)11 discussed Stuxnet as a digital phenomenon that derives from
the increasing dependence on technological means. Others, such as George Loukas (2015) 12 and
Dorothy E. Denning (2012)13, have instead focused on the impact of the cyber worm14.
However, there are no studies concerning the character of Stuxnet from the new and old war
perspective. In the era of globalization and advanced technological developments, it is important
to understand that the threats we are facing today are different from what they used to be.
If we do not understand the nature of contemporary threats we will not be able to neither prepare
nor protect ourselves from them.

As mentioned in the previous section, several countries have been victims of cyber-attacks prior
to Iran in 2010. Nevertheless, none of these attacks have drawn as much attention as Stuxnet did.
The uniqueness of the cyber worm is not merely related to the way it was implemented but also
to the physical destruction it caused the target. Stuxnet had been destroying over a 1000
centrifuges and attained valuable information from the Iranian nuclear program for at least a
year, while Iran had not the slightest suspicion of being attacked.15 Stuxnet is therefore an
interesting case to study in relation to Kaldor’s theory of new and old wars. The research
question that in this study is the following: To what extent can Stuxnet be categorized as a New
War, if at all?

1.3 Disposition
The following section is discussing the theoretical framework for this paper and is divided into
two main parts; old wars and new wars. The section that engages new wars has four
subcategories and consists of a short introduction of the concept, followed by three
characteristics of new wars; globalization, identity politics and method of warfare.
The next section is discussing the methodological framework for this paper. This section is
describing the way the study is conducted, the choice of data collecting strategy and a short
review of both strengths and weaknesses of the applied method.
The fourth chapter is a presentation of the applied theoretical framework and includes a sample
of previous research that is relevant for this study. The empirical analysis is divided into three
sections based on Mary Kaldor's characterization of old and new wars. Kaldor divides the
concept of new wars in different categories, where each category consists of different attributes,
while old wars are mainly based on Clausewitz perception of war. The empirical study contains
of the following three categories: The aim, the actors involved and the method of warfare. Each
part of the material will then be analyzed in the relevant category, for example; the material
regarding the aim/s of Stuxnet will be presented in the first category. The final section is a
conclusion of the study and will address an answer to the research question.

2. Theory
As mentioned previously, it is of great importance to identify and understand the new threats the
world might face along with the technological and political changes of our time. Mary Kaldor’s
theory of new and old wars is identifying and distinguishing traditional and modern wars. This is
to provide a broader understanding of war in the modern era, which is a relevant theoretical
framework for this study. New wars are a combination of wars (usually described as violence
between political organizations and/or states for political purposes), the use of force between
criminal organizations for private motives and the abuse of human-rights (states and/or political
organizations using force against individuals).16 17
However, there are opponents to the concept of ‘new wars’, such as Errol Henderson and David
Singer, who argues that there are different types of warfare but that the essence of war is still the
same. ‘New wars’ are discussed to be merely the result of combined warfare’s, which has
developed throughout the time due to technological developments amongst other circumstances.
There are thus only one category of war and that is ‘old wars’.18 Kaldor agrees to this description
to a certain extent and more specifically in relation to the use of different warfare’s within new
wars. Nonetheless, the combination of a variety of warfare methods is far from the mere feature
of the concept. Kaldor argues that the concept of ‘new war’ mirrors the new reality that has
emerged due to globalization and must therefore be understood within its context.19

16

Kaldor (2013), p.2
This should not be confused with the concept of ‘Hybrid war’ (introduced by Frank Hoffman, Conflict in the 21st
Centurary: The Rise of Hybrid Wars, 2011), which is more concerned with the different types of war and the
combination of warfare’s. The concept suggests that wars today mainly has the same objectives as conventional
wars, but what distingushies ‘hybrid wars’ is the variety of actors involved and the mixture of war methods. An
example of a hybrid war is the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, involving a state and a non-state actor,
which acted in some degree on behalf of another state. The conflict contained a variety of warfare’s including
conventional and unconventional warfare’s such as the use of guerrilla fighters.

Kaldor argues that there are two timeframes that divides the concepts of new and old war, which
are the post-Cold war era and the era prior to it. The wars in the post-Cold war era are conducted
within the globalization process, they entail capabilities and aims that differ from conventional
wars and requires therefore to be studied differently.20 To understand and thus prepare for such
conflicts, it is rather important to distinguish old wars from new ones and not the least to define
what war is. According to Kaldor, the aims, involved actors and the methods of warfare are the
main differentiations between old and new wars.21 This will be explained further in 2.2 New
wars, where the different aspects of the concept are presented.
In this study Kaldor's theory of new and old wars will be applied on the case of Stuxnet, to
understand the cyber-attack that has been argued to be the world's first cyber weapon.22
However, one cannot examine if Stuxnet can be defined as a new war, according to Kaldor's
theory, without the understanding of what old wars are in the first place. The following section
will therefore present Kaldor's definition of old wars, followed by her characterization of new
wars.

2.1 Old wars
Kaldor's description of old wars is mainly established from Carl von Clausewitz perception of
war. According to Clausewitz, war is a social activity that is managed and coordinated mainly by
men who aim to impose physical violence towards the enemy. He argued that wars have their
own unique logic and that all societies have their specific distinctive form of war.23 The most
common definition of war, used by military leaders and policy makers amongst others, is based
on a certain phenomenon that evolved in Europe in the 1400th- 1900th century. This phenomenon
is connected to the development of the modern state and has been through several changes
throughout time. Some of the most significant phases it went through was the beginning of the

rather small wars between the 1500th -1700thcentenary that was connected to the absolute state
and the arousing of power it brought with it, to the revolutionary wars such as the American
Civil War and the Napoleonic War in the 1800th century that were associated with the creation of
nation-states, to the total wars in the beginning of the 1900th century and later to the "imaginary"
Cold War in the late 1900th century that consisted of wars of alliances and blocks.24
All the above-mentioned changes are different types of warfare with variations of strategies,
relations and military means. However, war was still acknowledged as the same phenomena and
the different phases it went through were merely a diversity of shapes the event could adapt. The
characterization of the phenomena of war is as cited by Kaldor: "...a construction of the
centralized, `rationalized', hierarchically ordered, territorialized modern state."

25

Nevertheless, the modern state as described above is leaving room for new shapes of sovereignty
that have evolved from modern global developments and thus, making war an anachronism. 26
But what characterizes old wars? According to Clausewitz definition, war is a violent act that
aims to enforce ones will over the enemy. Clausewitz defines actors in this context as states, and
merely states, thus, the will that is imposed on the enemy using force, is representing the
interests of the state. In other words, wars are fought due to state interests. 27 Although the aims
in war might vary, due to the interests and the political motives that the states are seeking, the
warfare is always the same. Clausewitz argues that combat is the only way of conducting a war
and thus, absolute war is simply the solely method of defeating the enemy28
As previously mentioned, the perception of war that most people have today began along the
formation of the modern state. Prior to that, citizen militias fought battles since there were no
clear distinction between the state and the civilians. In the beginning of the European stage
formation, armies were created and uniforms were made to distinguish the military from the
civilians. This was mainly to distinguish criminal actors that used violence, from the state whom,
were also using violence acts. The formation of the absolute state and their armies was the

foundation of the justification of war. What justified wars is therefore the interests of the states,
if a state sought certain benefits that could be achieved through war, the act was legitimized.29

2.2

New wars

New wars contain features from the pre-modern era (such as the features of war described in 2.1)
and modernity/post-modernity and is a phenomenon that mainly evolved in the post-Cold War
era. According to Kaldor, the purpose for distinguishing old and new wars is to change the
general conception of war. It is necessary to identify and recognize new wars since the world is
facing a new reality. This reality, along with the new wars, needs to be understood within the
context of globalization. Globalization is a comprehensive concept that portrays the diverse
changes of the contemporary era, which consequently has affected the nature of war.30 The
process of globalization has contributed to a stronger interdependence between states in many
regards. Two of the main sources to the interdependence in the international arena, is the spread
of democracy and the financial cooperation’s. This has led to fewer wars between nation-states,
since war could risk more than it could benefit. 31 Herfried Münkler, in agreement with the
above-mentioned argument, complements with emphasizing on the important role that both
ethnicity and religion has in new wars. Münkler argues that the cultural, ethnic and religious
movements are adapting the shape of social-ideologies and has been a way for mobilizing
support for warring groups. This, amongst other events within the contemporary political realm,
has decreased the presence of military interventions and is thus one of the main distinguishes of
new wars.32
The following chapters are describing three of the main aspects within Kaldor’s concept of new
wars, namely: globalization, identity politics and method of warfare.

2.2.1 Globalization
According to Kaldor, globalization is a paradoxical concept since it covers the complicated
process that includes localization, fragmentation, homogenization and integration as well as
globalization, at the same moment. 33 However, in a more specific definition of globalization,
Kaldor describes it as an increased global interrelation in cultural, financial, political, military
manners and finally, the developed nature of political authority. She argues that the globalization
of the 1980's and 1990's was a new phenomenon, although globalization can be traced back to
modernity or even prior to that. It has been debated that new wars are the outcome of the Cold
War, which represents a void in power. The phenomenon can also be regarded as the result of the
revolution in data processing, communication and information technologies and as the
foundation for the interconnected world we know of today. 34
According to Emile Simpson the inter-connectivity of globalization might destabilize the classic
strategies of war. The fundamental aspects of Clausewitz definition of war can be challenged
through the era of globalization. One of these challenges is the increasing distinction between
military and political activities, which relays on the rising attention of the global audiences. The
strategies in war are becoming more thoughtful of the global audience’s judgement and is thus
adjusting to suit such opinions. 35
The new wars are evidently effected by globalization in a variety of aspects. Some of these
changes includes the humanitarian and political involvement of non-governmental organization
(NGO's) and international reporters, to mention but a few. However, what seems to be one of the
main uncertainties in the debates of globalization, is the question of the future of "territorially
based sovereignty"36, in other words, the absolute state. States capability to be violent towards
other states unilaterally has been vastly reduced and this is due to various reasons, among them
being the interconnections between states such as military alliances and international arms trade

and global norms that limits certain war acts in relation to international treaties. Thus, one could
argue that the sovereignty of states is weakened, if not threatened by globalization.37 But there
are also other aspects that could threaten the absolute state in relation to globalization. If
globalization has evolved the world through technological and ethical connections, the threats
that the world faces must have changed as well in equivalence to its context.

2.2.2 Identity politics
In old wars, political motives (argued to be one of the main reasons for states involvement in
wars) were essentially linked to ideologies38. Political motives are still argued to be one of the
main reasons for the use of force, even in new wars. However, it is the definition of political
motives that varies from the perhaps more traditional descriptions of the term. Kaldor presents
two features of the new wave of identity politics in the context of globalization. The first one is
global, local, national and transnational. There are for example Diaspora communities that
increase their influences through the modern channels of communication and by the facilities of
travel and can thus share and enforce their ideas. The second feature of identity politics is
benefiting from the modern technology, where the media both delivers and constructs political
and cultural norms. Horizontal cultures are evolving within the process of globalization, through
new transnational networks that are established on transnational languages such as English,
which is connected to well recognized companies like Mc Donald’s or Coca-Cola ™ and Arabic
that nurtured modern TV channels such as Al Jazeera. 39 However, Kaldor makes a distinction
between “Identity politics” and “Identity” in the context of conflicts in the globalization process.
While the concept of “identity politics” is referring to religious, ethnical and racial movements,
“identity” is a usage of labelling that are used as a source in political claims.40

2.2.3 The Method of Warfare
Another difference between new and old wars is the type of warfare used. In old wars the aim
was more than often to occupy territories through military power and the use of force was
therefore a crucial part of war. Although the use of force is still recognized in new wars, it is not
a necessity to achieve the objectives. Battles are rather avoided, although used when necessary,
in new wars and territories are sought to be controlled through political power instead. This
might be implemented through i.e. the imposement of a certain political identity over a
population while demolishing the other identities.41 This can be correlated to the concept of
smart power strategy, explained by Joseph Nye. He argues that in an increasingly decentralized
political system, it is essential to combine soft and hard power strategies to achieve political
aims. However, smart power strategies must be understood within its context for it to succeed. In
other words, it is vital to study the tactics in relation to the aim.42
In the globalization era, the aims of war are not necessarily the same as in conventional wars and
requires therefore requires a different method of warfare. Michael Sheehan argues that new wars
are a product of the globalization process and consists of mainly two types of warfare. The first
method of warfare in new wars can be found in countries like the U.S, where advanced
technological means has been used towards traditional armies and resulted in dramatic
conquests. This has led to debates regarding an eventual transformation of the conventional
military affairs. The second type of warfare involves mainly non-state actors and the role of
traditional military armies is therefore not as significant as they are in conventional wars.43
New wars can also be fought through the media, where a framework of a certain perception is
created and widespread through i.e. televisions. In this regard, the media is a rather powerful
instrument that can change and create the moral of the public opinion. Covering a specific aspect

13

of a conflict, where one part is portrayed as the victim, while the other part as the villain, sets the
ground of what characterizes good and evil. Another aspect of new wars through the media is the
frequent coverages of violent conflicts in wars, which weakens the moral and political
restrictions of war since it appears as a regularity. 44 This brings us back to Nye’s argument
regarding the necessity of combining soft and hard power strategies in the globalization era,
where both policies are significant depending on the context. Soft power as described above, can
take shape in media coverage and shapes the moral discourse of the public and can thus
contribute to a certain political control, whereas hard power might be relevant in inevitable
battles.

As presented above, there are certain similarities yet crucial differences between new and old
wars. The following table is a conclusion of the most distinctive and fundamental features of new
and old wars:

3. Method
This chapter is presenting the applied research design for this study, the strategy of data
collection and the methodological framework for analyzing the data.

3.1 Research design
This study applies the case study design, where the case of Stuxnet will be analyzed as a single
case within the theoretical framework. The characterization of case study design demands an
intensive and in-depth analysis, while focusing on the complexity and the character of the
studied case.45 One of the distinguishing features of case studies, is that the researcher is
generally concerned with identifying and illuminating the unique features of the studied case.46
This research has a deductive approach, meaning that it is a theory-driven study where the
propositions are deduced within the theoretical framework and a general knowledge of the
case.47
Since the aim of this paper is to study the nature of Stuxnet in a detailed manner while examining
to what extent it can be characterized as Kaldor's description of new wars, the case study design
is a suitable method for conducting the study. Nonetheless, as much as this research design is
appropriate for studying a case in detail, it is problematic to generalize the result.48 This study is
therefore aiming to be a contribution to this research field.

3.2

Qualitative content analysis

The approach of qualitative content analysis will be applied in the case study, meaning that the
collected data will be studied in-depth to provide a profound understanding of the event. The
purpose of qualitative data analysis is to interpret the meaning of the material in a

methodological manner. Nevertheless, the strategy of qualitative content analysis is not able to
provide an interpretation that covers all the material and the researcher is therefore required to
focus on a specific aspect of the material that they desire to analyse.49
The research question is the compass that directs the qualitative content analysis towards a
certain aspect of the collected material and it is this specific feature of the strategy that differs
qualitative content analysis from other qualitative methods. Although qualitative content analysis
cannot cover the meaning of all the material, it is an excellent method for analysing a specific
matter in detail. Another beneficial attribute of this method is that it provides the possibility to
analyse a large amount of data, since the researcher is usually concerned with a limited aspect of
the information. 50 Qualitative research emphasizes on description and context51 and is therefore
a relevant approach for examining Stuxnet in the context of Kaldor's theory, which stresses that
new wars requires to be studied within the context of globalization.
According to Margrit Schreier all methods of qualitative data analysis has their own method for
overcoming the shortcomings of common understandings. The method of qualitative content
analysis uses a two-stepped strategy. First, the researcher needs to explain the meaning of the
material and divide the material into different sections of a coding frame. This will consequently
lead to the second part of the strategy, which is the identification of the valuable parts of the
material.52 This methodological strategy is applied on this study, where the collected material is
divided into different coding sections and analysed in relation to the aim of this paper. I will
intentionally collect the relevant information in the collected material regarding Stuxnet, in
relation to the theoretical framework, to answer the research question. As mentioned in the
disposition, the empirical analysis is divided into three categories; the aim, the actors involved,
and the method of warfare. The strategy of qualitative content analysis will assist in conducting
an organized structure, since one of its characteristics, according to Schreier, is to focus on the
relevant information of the material and classify it into different categories while using a coding
frame. The three categories in the empirical section will therefore be used as the coding frame
that will determine the relevance of the information in the collected material.

3.3 Material
The data collection will be gathered from already existing material, which will consist of both
primary and secondary sources. The primary sources consist of interviews and governmental
protocols. One of the main primary sources in this paper is the documentary “Zero days”,
directed by Alex Gibley. The documentary includes numerous interviews with a diversity of
cyber-security experts, decision-makers and government officials. The secondary sources include
previous research, governmental documents, public sources and articles.
The sampling of the data is based on the relevance of the content in relation to the aim of the
research. This is a relatively common sampling strategy in case studies since the purpose is to
investigate the case in a detailed manner.53 However, since the data is collected through what I
find is relevant to this research, which is a form of a subjective sampling strategy, the result
cannot be generalized.54 It is therefore of great significance to aim at collecting data from various
reliable sources to minimalize the possibility of distortion. Nevertheless, the aim of this research
is not to prove a certain assumption, but rather to examine if the new war theory can provide a
suitable explanation of the cyber-attack in 2010. Due to this, I believe that the probability of
being bias when collecting the data is rather low, although I am aware of the possibility.

3.4 Opalization
The reason for selecting to study the case of Stuxnet is mentioned in the previous chapters.
Nonetheless, I have yet not explained why Stuxnet is examined as a war in the first place. To
understand the nature of Stuxnet, it is rather essential to identify the different classifications of
cyber-attacks as a term.

According to Richard Clarke, former national US security director, there are four different
phenomena’s regarding cyber-attacks:
•

Cybercrime: the theft of money.

•

Cyber hacktivism: Includes groups like Anonymous and WikiLeaks that steals
information from the original publisher for political reasons, or organized groups who are
hacking for amusements.

•

Cyber espionage: Arguably the most serious matter in the cyber realm and is the digital
method of stealing valuable information.

•

Cyber war: Although it is not that common yet, the US-led sabotage against the Iranian
nuclear facilities, leading to physical destruction of the centrifuges through cyber-attacks,
can be described as a war. 55

In similarity with Clarke, Eugene Kaspersky argues that the physical destruction caused by the
cyber worm and the political conflict between Iran and the US-Israeli alliance, can define
Stuxnet as a cyber war.56 I am conceptualizing Stuxnet in this study accordingly to the abovepresented arguments.
The analyzation of the collected material is as previously mentioned divided into three categories
based on the theoretical framework. These categories are adapted from Kaldor’s conceptual
definitions of new wars. Although Kaldor mentions a variety of features of new wars, I have
chosen to focus on the purpose of war, the actors involved and the way of warfare. This selection
is based on the belief that the above-mentioned categories are fundamental aspects that will assist
in defining and characterizing Stuxnet in relation to the research question. As presented in
table.1, new and old wars have different parameters in the description of wars. I will now present
how these parameters and concepts are operationalized during this study.

Identity politics is as mentioned in the theory chapter, one of the main goals in new wars. This
concept is not difficult to measure since Kaldor has a rather concreate definition of the term,
namely; a movement that claim power in relation to racial, ethnic and/or religious objectives.57
Private motives and political motives on the other hand, are perhaps more diffuse. Both concepts
are directly linked to the actors behind the war act, which makes it essential to define whom they
are in the first place. The word ‘private’ in this context refers to the privately organized criminal
groups and the private motives are thus the aims of such organizations. According to Kaldor the
aims of criminal groups are usually concerning financial benefits58. In relation to cyberattacks,
this definition is rather identical Clark’s description of ‘cybercrime’ and I will thus measure the
‘private motives’ with the same parameters.
Kaldor refers to the ‘political motives’ as the aim of states and/or political organizations. This
concept differs from the political motives in old wars, which refers to state interests and is
usually concerned with territorial expansion, economical gains and political power through a
state perspective59. In new wars however, the word ‘politics’ is understood within the context of
globalization and is connected to the concept of identity politics. ‘Politics’ in this perspective is
therefore related to culture, nation-tribes and/or religion60 and will thus be used with these
measures when conducting this study.

4. Stuxnet: New or old war?
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Leon E. Panetta argued that cyberspace have changed the way
we live, providing people across the world to access information through various of
communication channels, broadening the international economic sphere and contributed to a
world full of possibilities. Along with these possibilities however, comes responsibilities and
new risks. The internet is accessible for everyone, an open space which connects the world with
a single click. Along with this openness, a new ground of war has evolved creating a new and
limitless battlefield that makes it possible for enemies to harm states, citizens and their economy.
61

In January 2009, officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) observed
unusual circumstances at the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz, Iran. The centrifuges in
Natanz were expected to remain working for about ten years, however due to the sensibility of
the centrifuges Iran replaced up to ten percent each year. It was therefore relatively usual for
Iran to replace around 800 centrifuges per year due to a variety of product defects and concerns
regarding the maintenance.62 Officials from the IAEA believes that approximately 2,000
centrifuges were replaced by Iran between 2009-2010, and although the cause of the damaged
centrifuges was right in front of them it took them almost a year to detect it. 63
Later in 2010, a Belarusian computer security firm detected a new type of malware, later known
as Stuxnet. Although the discovery of a new type of malware was neither unexpected nor
uncommon, the character and sophistication of Stuxnet was certainly different.64
In previous sections, the characterizations of new and old wars were presented within the
theoretical framework. The following sections will be divided into the three main features of the
wars, presented in table.1, where each category will be analysed in relation to Stuxnet.
By defining and analysing the aims, the method and the actors involved in Stuxnet, I will be able
to investigate if the cyber worm can be characterized as a new or old war.

4.1 The aim of Stuxnet
The first reports claiming that Iran was developing nuclear weapons came in the 1970’s and
since then numerous of similar reports have accused the Iranian nuclear program for being a
camouflage for a productive and advanced base for the creation of mass destruction weapons.
Iran has since the time of the Shah, where the first accusations emerged, denied having the
intentions of building nuclear weapons and argued that their nuclear activities are nothing but
peaceful. Nonetheless, despite the large number of alarming reports against their nuclear
activities, no conclusive evidence has been presented.65
However, after the fall of the Shah there has not been much data regarding Iran’s nuclear
facilities and the lack of transparency generated further accusations. Iran on the other hand,
defended itself by claiming that they were act in accordance with arms control agreements and
justified each new finding by referring to the development of a peaceful national nuclear power
program. The outcome of these developments was a series of nuclear facilities and programs
with unclear purposes. The suspicions against Iran’s nuclear weapon program grew along with
their nuclear achievements.66
Iran’s nuclear program has been the victim of industrial sabotages for a long period of time. Due
to its dependence on certain foreign modules, the nuclear program is in a particularly exposed
situation. Despite the large amount of sabotages towards Iran’s nuclear program, Stuxnet is by
far the most advanced and destructive attack of them all. 67
In June 2009, a vicious digital weapon was secretly unleashed on computers in Iran, finding its
way into the vital systems in Natanz. 68 This digital weapon is now more known as Stuxnet.
Stuxnet is a cyber worm constructed to target a certain service on a very exact sort of Siemens
software that are used in the crucial systems of Iran’s nuclear facilities. The software systems
that were targeted are in control of the frequency converts, which regulates the speed of the
centrifuges in the enrichment program. The cyber worm made these software systems command
the equipment to speed in a destructive manner, leading to the centrifuges destroying themselves.

21

Stuxnet is therefore argued to be specifically made with the intention to sabotage Iran enrichment
program. 69
According to the article “Stuxnet: targeting Iran’s nuclear programme”, the aim of Stuxnet is to
mainly postpone Iran’s nuclear program through hindering their facilities to function, all this
while acting in complete secret. The aim of Stuxnet is therefore not to sabotage Iran’s nuclear
program in a manner that would eliminate its existence, but rather to delay it to buy the
International community some time to pressure Iran through sanctions and negotiations and
perhaps to plan for complementary policy measures. Instead of developing their already
advanced nuclear facilities Iran would be occupied with reconstructing their damaged centrifuges
and reviewing their cyber defense system. The vulnerable situation of Iran after Stuxnet, would
therefore facilitate for the International community to impose their requirements. However,
there has been other, more violent, methods for delaying the Iranian nuclear facilities than cyberattacks. Several Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated through severe means such as
bomb-explosions and mysterious traffic “accidents”. Cyber-attacks could therefore be argued to
be a rather unconventional but un-lethal method for delaying the developments Iran’s nuclear
program. 70
In similarity with the article from IISS Strategic Comments, Kim Zetter argues that Stuxnet was
specifically designed to target Iran’s nuclear facilities. Nevertheless, Zetter claims that the cyber
worm was not merely constructed for delaying Iran’s nuclear program, rather it was unleashed
for one purpose and that was to damage their uranium enrichment program in such a destructive
manner that would hinder President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from creating a potential nuclear
weapon. 71
Zetter is not alone with this explanation. Siemens cyber-security experts declared that Stuxnet
was found in America, Australia, parts of Africa and all over Europe. Nonetheless, over 60% of
the cyber-attack was targeting Iran alone. The geo-political situation of Iran was studied with the
aim of finding correlations between the cyber-attack and the political circumstances. The

relatively brief research showed that Iran had recently suffered from unexplained gas pipeline
explosions and mysterious assassinations of nuclear scientists. This in relation to the fact that the
malware destroyed the Iranian nuclear centrifuges, made it rather evident that the aim of Stuxnet
was to sabotage the development of Iran’s nuclear program. 72
Mariarosaria Taddeo and Ludovica Glorioso are in accordance with the above-mentioned
opinions, arguing that the specific design of Stuxnet and the way it damaged the Iranian uranium
enrichment specifically, are clear indications of the aim of the cyber worm- preventing Iran from
building a potential nuclear weapon by sabotaging their nuclear program. According to Taddeo
and Glorioso, this goal is something that the clear majority of the international community would
regard as beneficial since it could prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon and in that sense,
Stuxnet has contributed to a safer world.73
Both security experts and diplomats have stated that Israel and Western governments believes
that one of the most effective ways for slowing the Iranian nuclear program is through damaging
it. By sabotaging crucial parts of the nuclear program, such as the uranium enrichment, Iran will
be prevented from building nuclear weapons. The cyber security firm Symantec has conducted a
study that confirms the sabotage theory based on the way Stuxnet is controlling the behavior of
the equipment (the frequency converts). The aim of unleashing a cyber worm that specifically
targets one of the world’s most feared nuclear programs by systematically and secretively
destroying the most crucial part of its developing system, cannot be other than eliminating the
risk of Iran building nuclear weapons.74
Regardless of the criticism and tributes of Stuxnet’s purpose, the majority, if not all, agree that
the aim of the cyber worm was to sabotage the Iranian uranium enrichment program and thus
prevent a potential nuclear weapon. This makes the aim of the cyber-attack highly political,
which is a common denominator in both new and old war’s in regard of the objectives of war.

However, as presented in the theory section, political aims have different meanings in new and
old wars. Limiting the capabilities of a state and preventing them from constructing and
developing their military means, can be explained as political targets through a variety of
aspects.
As the article from the IISS Strategic Comment and Taddeo and Glorioso argued, most of the
international community would like to see a less developed Iranian nuclear program and are
therefore more likely to approve of the aim of Stuxnet (dismissing its unconventional method).
However, ‘international community’ as a term has been widely debated. The fundamental, yet
somewhat unsatisfactory definition of the terms, is referring to a group of countries acting
together as a unit.75 This is in accordance with the United Nations definition of the term, where
they explain it as a unity between states, intergovernmental organization and NGO’s in the
globalization era. The result of the international community can be seen in international law,
global cooperation’s such as economic, environmental and peacekeeping treaties. The
international community is facing the same threats from nuclear weapons, climate change yet
share the common benefits from the social and technological developments.76
However, not everyone agrees with this description. One of the debates regarding the term is
made by Noam Chomsky who argues that the term is merely used by the US and their allies,
while referring to themselves while aiming to increase their credibility and power.77 Martin
Jacques shares Chomsky’s explanation and argues that ‘international community’ is a synonym
to the West and is used by them to exalt and globalize their image. 78
Regardless of which definition of the term one prefers, both explanations agree that it entails
states. In this regard, the aim of Stuxnet can be argued to be linked to the interest of states, since
the international community, according to the sources mentioned above, would like for Iran to
have limited nuclear facilities. This would be in accordance to Clausewitz, who argued that states

24

interest is the main aim of war. Furthermore, Clausewitz argument regarding states interest is
divided into different sections, among them being the power, financial gains and territorial
expansions. Though territorial expansion is not relevant in the case of Stuxnet, since the target
was the Iranian nuclear program, both political power and financial gains can be discussed.
The international communities interest in limiting Iran’s nuclear facilities, is argued to be
directly linked to defence policies since they want to eliminate the risk of new nuclear weapons.
If that is the mere reason, one might ask why other nuclear programs and facilities such as
Pakistan79, North Korea80 or Israel81, have not been targeted in the same manner. It has been
argued that the US and their allies’ role in the Middle East is threatened by the dominating
presence of Iran and if Iran develops nuclear weapons, the international community, assuming it
is Chomsky’s definition of the term, will not be as influential as they would like to be. 82
In this aspect, the aim of Stuxnet can be interpreted as a way of achieving more power and can
therefore be connected to both new and old wars. Nonetheless, it is the means of achieving
power that distinguishes the wars from each other. In Clausewitz’s explanation, power is usually
connected with physical targets such as territorial expansions, which again, is not relevant in this
case. New wars on the other hand, associates power to political control, which is aimed to be
achieved without the use of force. It could be argued that the attacker imposed their will, which
is to limit the Iranian nuclear facilities, and thus achieving a certain level of political control on
the victim. In this regard, there might be more similarities with the characterizations of new wars
since the political aim was achieved without the use of force. Nonetheless, the aspect of identity
politics where movements of ethnic, religious and racial identities organizes to claim state
power83, is absent in the case of Stuxnet.

4.2

The actors involved

According to the computer security experts that have studied Stuxnet, it is most likely that a
nation state/s is behind the attack and this is due to the amount of recourses, complexity and the
risks of the cyber worm. 84 Vitaly Kamluk a director at Kaspersky Lab, agrees with this
explanation and argues that criminals are usually interested in stealing money, while hacktivists
usually have political agendas. Nation states on the other hand, are interested in valuable
information or sabotage activities. Due to the target of Stuxnet, the cyber-attack is most likely
the result of one or more nation states.85 As mentioned in the previous section, several sources
claim that Stuxnet is the result of an US-Israeli cooperation. However, despite these accusations
against the US and Israel, none of them has admitted to the crime, which can only be expected in
such a situation where the secret weaponized codes, like in the case of Stuxnet, can be deniable
unlike the dropping of bombs.86
Nonetheless, there are some indications in the malware that supports these speculations.
One of these indications is the number “19790509” which was found in the code of Stuxnet. This
number is argued to be the date of Persian Jewish businessman and head of Tehran’s Jewish
community’s Habib Elghanian’s execution in Iran. 87 Another, although rather weak, indication
is the name “Myrtus” that appears in the code. It is believed that Myrtus is a reference to the Old
Testament and more specifically to the Book of Esther, where Esther was described as the one
who saved the Jews from the Persians. Nonetheless, the letter combination RTU found in
MyRTUs, can also be defined as “Remote Terminal Unit”, which is a common device that is
frequently linked to Siemens controlling systems, also known as Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Nonetheless, the aim of Stuxnet and the political circumstances
in the region makes Israel a natural suspect. Israel has both the motives, capability and

opportunity to conduct the cyber-attack towards the Iranian nuclear facilities, and so does the
US.88
The New York Times reported that Stuxnet was developed by both the US and Israel who aimed
at slowing the Iranian nuclear facilities. According to the article, members from the former US
president Obama’s national security team, confirms the suspicion of an US-Israeli cooperation
behind Stuxnet.89 Another indication of Israel’s involvement in the launch of the cyber-attack,
was on Israeli general Gabi Ashkenazi’s last day at work where a video that included references
to Stuxnet was presented. The video was a presentation of his achievements during his service,
which fuelled the speculation towards Israel’s involvement in the cyber-attacks even further. 90
In 2016, the US government accused Iran for being behind several cyber-attacks between 20112013, targeting a New York dam and U.S banks, which led to economic loses. The US claimed
that the attacks were persistent and strategic and could therefore not be the work of individual
Iranian hackers but rather the Iranian administration. Security experts have argued that these
cyber-attacks are direct consequences of Stuxnet and that both the US and Israel might be
victims of such attacks in the future due to their debated involvement in the cyber sabotage in
Natanz 2010.91
This indicates that Stuxnet has created a counterattack, which resembles the perhaps more
conventional features of war. According to Clausewitz wars craves counterattacks, where the
defender is aiming to use counterattacks to primarily achieve victory but also to deter and protect
the state from potential attacks.92 However, it is not merely the counterattacks that resembles the
perception of old wars but also the actors involved. Even though there are no official statements
confirming the responsible actors behind Stuxnet, most sources agree that it is an US-Israeli

cooperation. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that all the primary actors involved in
Stuxnet are states. In this regard, the involvement of actors in Stuxnet is in accordance with the
perception of old wars, which argues that the main actors in wars are states.
New wars do recognize states involvements in wars as well, although within the context of
globalization. According to Kaldor, government organizations are changing in the globalization
process, where government activities within different departments are entailing privatized or
semi-privatized arrangements. This has challenged the perhaps more conventional perception of
a nation state. Governments in the contemporary globalization era are developing horizontal and
transnational connections, which means that the decentralization of power that is usually seen in
NGO’S can also be found in nation states. This means that the global political structure is
evolving, where the link between nation states, NGO’s and companies are more interconnected.93
This can be correlated to Iran’s accusations towards the engineering firm Siemens (the industrial
control system for the Iranian nuclear program) for assisting the US and Israel to launch Stuxnet.
Carey Nachenberg, Vice president at Symantec Corp, referred to Stuxnet as a wake-up call for
the world. Stuxnet bypassed all the acknowledged cyber security companies, which stresses the
fact that it is extremely difficult to protect ourselves from such attacks. Seven different
mechanisms were used in Stuxnet to spread its virus, these mechanisms are from Siemen’s and
are used for programing industrial systems, such as the PLC. Nonetheless, one of these
software’s had a default password that came from the manufacturer; Siemen’s. Stuxnet broke
through the defaulted password and could thus access the system. 94
Iran's civil defence chief, Gholamreza Jalali requested a legally investigation of Siemens
SCADA software’s role in the case of Stuxnet. He argues that there are vital indications that the
US and Israel could not have obtained the necessary information to target the SCADA software
on their own and more specifically, without the assistance of Siemens. Siemens was accused for
providing valuable information regarding the control system, such as maintaining a defaulted

password, of the Iranian nuclear program to the US and Israel, which facilitated the cyber-attack.
95

Reviewing Stuxnet from this aspect, provides a possible recognition of the characterization of
new wars that entails the involvement of both states and other global actors in war. The Iranian
nuclear program and crucial information regarding its survival is dependent on an internet-based
control system. Due to the nature of the internet, its openness and speed, the interconnection
between a diversity of actors is not only inevitable, but also essential. The cooperation between
nation states and a variety of other global actors, such as international companies and NGO’s, is
equally inevitable in the sphere of globalization. It could therefore be argued, despite the
accuracy of the accusations regarding Siemens involvement in Stuxnet, that nation states and
other global actors are interconnected in the cyber-attacks towards the Iranian nuclear facilities.

4.3 The Method of Stuxnet
A Zero-day vulnerability is a hole in the software that the owner or developer is not aware of.
When hackers find this hole before the owner has the chance to even discover and repair it, it is
referred to as a zero-day attack. The Zero-day attacks are used for espionage, instructing
malwares and accessing valuable and classified information. The term itself is a referent to the
anonymous character of the hole for everyone besides the hackers.96
Advanced cyber-attacks that are conducted by criminals and hackers has at the most one zeroday. Stuxnet on the other hand, had four zero-days in one single malware, which has never been
seen before nor after Stuxnet. 97In the case of Stuxnet, the zero-day vulnerability was used to
spread a malware, which is a malicious software that is capable of undermining, stealing and
sabotaging data. In this context data is defined as zeros and ones, meaning that malware is
electrons undermining other electrons. The destruction of these electrons does not mean the mere

29

destruction of valuable data, but that actual physical objects that are managed by electricity
might be equally sabotaged. 98
Stuxnet attacked a Microsoft operating system, called SCADA. The computers that controls
SCADA are usually not directly connected to the Internet, due to the valuable information it
contains. This connection is usually avoided through an air gap between the SCADA controlled
computer and the internet. Nonetheless, there are certain methods to avoid this air gap. There is a
possibility to insert the malware on the sensitive side of the air gap, this however, can only be
done by a spy. This is argued to be the case with Stuxnet, where the Siemens SCADA system is
believed to have been infiltrated through a memory thumb drive. Stuxnet was deliberately
avoiding attacking the non-centrifuges SCADA’s since it could reveal its cover. This indicates
that the developers of Stuxnet had significant information regarding the Natanz plant and the
Siemens SCADA system, since the cyber worm could tactically avoid the gaps that could exploit
its presence. 99
Stuxnet is 20 times larger than an average code and contains almost no bugs, which is extremely
rare. All the digital codes within Stuxnet were actively working towards a certain target to
conduct the attack. It took the cyber-security experts months to even detect the secret codes,
which is a process that usually takes a few minutes to implement with regular cyber-attacks.
Viruses usually spreads through additional devices, such as damaged disks or files, Stuxnet was
however different in that regard. One of the significant aspects of Stuxnet is that it spread and
evolved the virus on its own, which means that the victim has no chance to protect themselves.
The actors behind the attack could not go to companies such as Microsoft and ask them for
digital codes, since that would expose them. Instead, the digital codes used in Stuxnet were
stolen and could later be tracked back to two companies in Taiwan.100
Ralph Langner, one of the control security experts who analysed Stuxnet during the attack,
argues that the malware was directly targeting Siemens computers and more specifically the
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which is a small computer that is connected to physical

equipment’s. This small computer runs a digital program, which controls the speed and actions
of the equipment’s. In the case of Stuxnet, it was used to control the speed of the motors of
Iranian centrifuges in Natanz. Although the advanced malware had the ability to break through
various of codes and thus control a variety of equipment’s, it only targeted the codes that were
directly linked to the motors of the Iranian nuclear centrifuges and ending up with destroying
over a thousand centrifuges.101 Stuxnet was therefore not designed to steal information or money,
it was simply trained to infiltrate the Iranian industrial program and to literally explode their
engines. 102
It is rather evident to say that Stuxnet was not implemented using force and thus the method of
warfare within the concept of old war, is not relevant in this specific case. New wars on the other
hand, suggests that the method of warfare has changed since the Clausewitzian war era. Violence
is avoided in new wars since the aim of these wars does not usually require force to be achieved.
Instead of using force to attack the Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the damages were implemented
through technical channels while avoiding anything that could draw attention to the malware.
The cyber worm was specifically designed to hide its tracks while attacking, which indicates that
the Clausewitizian understanding regarding the significance of battle in wars, was not just
avoided but also unnecessary for the attacker to reach their aim.
Since globalization is a vital aspect of new wars, it is of great essence to understand the way
Stuxnet was conducted within the context of globalization. The interconnected technological
networks provide a unified platform of services, that most modern nation states depend on.
Nonetheless, these very services might cause severe damages that can be conducted with a
simple click. The computer software that Stuxnet was spread through is a common Microsoft
device that is used by both individuals for private purposes and by nations states for critical and
classified matters. Although the attackers could not use the original Microsoft codes to access the
Iranian Siemen’s computers, due to the risks, they were easily able to steal the appropriate digital

codes from other companies that are located on the other side of the world. This is simply
because most actors, individuals, companies and nation states, use the same devices.
In this regard, it could be argued that the way Stuxnet was implemented is in accordance with
new wars, both in relation to the method of warfare and within the context of globalization.

32

5. Discussion
The first section described the aim of Stuxnet, which according to the majority of the sources
was to sabotage crucial parts of the Iranian nuclear program and thus hinder the construction of
nuclear weapons. According to the article from IISS Strategic comments, the attackers were
aware of the fact that the malware could not sabotage the Iranian nuclear program to the extent
that it would deter them from developing the it. Stuxnet was rather a method that bought the
international community some time to pressure Iran through i.e. sanction, to decrease their
uranium enrichment and be more transparent in regard of their nuclear program. This would be
more successful to conduct
while the Iranians were focused on their setbacks and could thus not afford further loses. Both
arguments agree that Stuxnet targeted one of the most crucial part of the Iranian nuclear program
and that the aim was to sabotage and hinder the development of their nuclear program and thus
prevent the construction of potential nuclear weapons. In this regard, the aim is political since it
is in the interests of nation states, sabotaging parts of another state’s nuclear program to hinder
them from developing what is feared to be nuclear weapons, can be argued to be a way of
imposing the will of the attacker on the victim. This is in accordance with the concept of ‘old
war’ since the main aim of war is to attain political objectives, although not in the sense of
expanding territories but rather in aspect of increasing the state’s political power.
Most cyber-security experts that has analysed Stuxnet, agrees that the cyber worm was not the
result of common hacktivism or cyber-criminality but the consequence of a distinctive and
authoritative state-cooperation. As mentioned above, the empirical analysis presented that
Stuxnet is most likely conducted by two nation states, namely; the US and Israel. Neither of the
states has admitted to the crime, which can only be expected in such situation. The signs within
the malware, the geo-political situation between Iran and the allies US and Israel, along with
statements from governmental officers, like in the case of Israeli general Gabi Ashkenazi, fuelled
the suspicions towards and US-Israeli cooperation. The main actors in Stuxnet is therefore nation
states, which is again in accordance with the concept of ‘old war’. ‘New wars’ do recognize the
involvement of states in wars, but argues that modern wars rarely involve just state actors. Iran

33

has however, accused the software company SIEMENs for providing valuable information to the
US and Israel, which made the cyber-attack possible. This can in a sense be argued to be in
favour of new wars, since an international non-state actor might be included in this attack.
Nonetheless, even if SIEMENs did contribute to the attack by providing information to the US
and Israel, the main actors are still the nation states.
Although Stuxnet is neither the first nor the last cyber-attack, it is unique in many regards.
Stuxnet is argued to have been implemented with a thumb drive by a spy, the cyber worm then
evolved on its own and infected software’s all over the world, where 60% of the virus were
found in Iran alone. It operated under complete secrecy and hid all the traces that could expose
its existence, which made the victim unaware of the attack. This led to severe damages of critical
equipment’s in the Iranian enrichment program and although Iran did eventually recover from
the damages, approximately 2,000 centrifuges were sabotaged through the cyber-attack.
Clausewitz argued that the aim of war cannot be reached without the use of violence and battles
are thus a necessary component in war. Kaldor on the other hand, claim that the use of force is
avoided in new wars and that the purposes of war can be achieved through other means. Stuxnet
achieved its aim in relation to causing physical damages on crucial parts of the Iranian nuclear
enrichment program, without the use of violence and is thus in accordance with Kaldor’s
description of method of warfare in new wars.

34

6. Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which Stuxnet can be characterized as a
new war, if at all. This has been of interest since defining the nature of Stuxnet is vital for both
preparing and protecting ourselves from future destructive cyber-attacks. The material used in
this study has been collected through a variety of sources, such as statements from cyber-security
experts and decision-makers, public sources and previous research. Although the objectivity of
public sources can be discussed, I believe that the wide range of varied material has contributed
to a perhaps more nuanced description of the case than it would have if one merely used one
certain sort of data. The empirical analysis has then been divided into three sections, where each
part focuses on different aspects of the attack within the theoretical framework of new and old
wars. The first section of the empirical analysis conducted that the aim of Stuxnet was political
and highlighted the absence of both the private (criminal objectives) and political (ethnic, tribal
or religious) purposes in new wars. The second part presented that the main actors involved in
Stuxnet were nation states, including the attackers and the victim. This is again in accordance
with the concept of ‘old wars’, that argues that wars entail merely nation state actors. Although
states are believed to be involved in ‘new wars’, the theory argues that other actors, such as
criminal organizations or non-governmental are part of the war as well. The third and final
aspect, is discussing the method of Stuxnet. Stuxnet was implemented digitally and caused
severe physical damages on the target, without the victim even realizing that it was under attack.
This contradicts the concept of ‘old war’, which argues that the objective of war can only be
applied through the use of force. Stuxnet did reach its goal in the sense that it sabotaged crucial
parts of the Iranian nuclear program without using violence. In this regard, Stuxnet was
conducted in accordance with the theory of ‘new wars’ that argues that violence is avoided and
even unnecessary in new wars.
It is therefore evident to conclude that Stuxnet cannot be characterized as either an old nor new
war, but rather a combination of both. In regard of the research question; Stuxnet can be
characterized as a new war in the extent of the method of warfare and the globalized context that
contributes to the interconnected world, which assisted in spreading the digital weapon through
devices located in all over the globe.
