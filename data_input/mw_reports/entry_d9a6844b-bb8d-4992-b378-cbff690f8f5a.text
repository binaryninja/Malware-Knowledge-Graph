Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network
Access by Exploiting Default Multifactor Authentication
Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a

Summary
Multifactor Authentication (MFA): A Cybersecurity Essential
• MFA is one of the most important cybersecurity practices to reduce the risk of intrusions—
according to industry research, users who enable MFA are up to 99 percent less likely to
have an account compromised.
• Every organization should enforce MFA for all employees and customers, and every user
should sign up for MFA when available.
• Organizations that implement MFA should review default configurations and modify as
necessary, to reduce the likelihood that a sophisticated adversary can circumvent this
control.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn organizations
that Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have gained network access through exploitation
of default MFA protocols and a known vulnerability. As early as May 2021, Russian statesponsored cyber actors took advantage of a misconfigured account set to default MFA
protocols at a non-governmental organization (NGO), allowing them to enroll a new device
for MFA and access the victim network. The actors then exploited a critical Windows Print
Spooler vulnerability, “PrintNightmare” (CVE-2021-34527) to run arbitrary code with system
privileges. Russian state-sponsored cyber actors successfully exploited the vulnerability
while targeting an NGO using Cisco’s Duo MFA, enabling access to cloud and email
accounts for document exfiltration.
This advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures, indicators of
compromise (IOCs), and recommendations to protect against Russian state-sponsored
malicious cyber activity. FBI and CISA urge all organizations to apply the recommendations
in the Mitigations section of this advisory, including the following:
Enforce MFA and review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and reenrollment scenarios.
Ensure inactive accounts are disabled uniformly across the Active Directory and MFA
systems.
Patch all systems. Prioritize patching for known exploited vulnerabilities.

Technical Details
Threat Actor Activity
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 10. See
Appendix A for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and
techniques.
As early as May 2021, the FBI observed Russian state-sponsored cyber actors gain access
to an NGO, exploit a flaw in default MFA protocols, and move laterally to the NGO’s cloud
environment.
Russian state-sponsored cyber actors gained initial access [TA0001] to the victim
organization via compromised credentials [T1078] and enrolling a new device in the
organization’s Duo MFA. The actors gained the credentials [TA0006] via brute-force
password guessing attack [T1110.001], allowing them access to a victim account with a
simple, predictable password. The victim account had been un-enrolled from Duo due to a
long period of inactivity but was not disabled in the Active Directory. As Duo’s default
configuration settings allow for the re-enrollment of a new device for dormant accounts, the
actors were able to enroll a new device for this account, complete the authentication
requirements, and obtain access to the victim network.
Using the compromised account, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors performed privilege
escalation [TA0004] via exploitation of the “PrintNightmare” vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527)
[T1068] to obtain administrator privileges. The actors also modified a domain controller file,
c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts , redirecting Duo MFA calls to localhost
instead of the Duo server [T1556]. This change prevented the MFA service from contacting
its server to validate MFA login—this effectively disabled MFA for active domain accounts
because the default policy of Duo for Windows is to “Fail open” if the MFA server is
unreachable. Note: “fail open” can happen to any MFA implementation and is not exclusive
to Duo.

2/7

After effectively disabling MFA, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors were able to
successfully authenticate to the victim’s virtual private network (VPN) as non-administrator
users and make Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to Windows domain
controllers [T1133]. The actors ran commands to obtain credentials for additional domain
accounts; then using the method described in the previous paragraph, changed the MFA
configuration file and bypassed MFA for these newly compromised accounts. The actors
leveraged mostly internal Windows utilities already present within the victim network to
perform this activity.
Using these compromised accounts without MFA enforced, Russian state-sponsored cyber
actors were able to move laterally [TA0008] to the victim’s cloud storage and email accounts
and access desired content.
Indicators of Compromise
Russian state-sponsored cyber actors executed the following processes:
ping.exe - A core Windows Operating System process used to perform the

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP Ping command; used to test network
connectivity to a remote host [T1018] and is frequently used by actors for network
discovery [TA0007].
regedit.exe - A standard Windows executable file that opens the built-in registry
editor [T1112].
rar.exe - A data compression, encryption, and archiving tool [T1560.001]. Malicious
cyber actors have traditionally sought to compromise MFA security protocols as doing
so would provide access to accounts or information of interest.
ntdsutil.exe - A command-line tool that provides management facilities for Active
Directory Domain Services. It is possible this tool was used to enumerate Active
Directory user accounts [T1003.003].
Actors modified the c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file to prevent communication
with the Duo MFA server:
127.0.0.1 api-<redacted>.duosecurity.com

The following access device IP addresses used by the actors have been identified to date:
45.32.137[.]94
191.96.121[.]162
173.239.198[.]46
157.230.81[.]39

Mitigations

3/7

The FBI and CISA recommend organizations remain cognizant of the threat of statesponsored cyber actors exploiting default MFA protocols and exfiltrating sensitive
information. Organizations should:
Enforce MFA for all users, without exception. Before implementing, organizations
should review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment
scenarios.
Implement time-out and lock-out features in response to repeated failed login attempts.
Ensure inactive accounts are disabled uniformly across the Active Directory, MFA
systems etc.
Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT
network assets in a timely manner. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities,
especially critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or
denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.
Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be
reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may
have access.
Continuously monitor network logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized or unusual
login attempts.
Implement security alerting policies for all changes to security-enabled
accounts/groups, and alert on suspicious process creation events ( ntdsutil , rar ,
regedit , etc.).
Note: If a domain controller compromise is suspected, a domain-wide password reset—
including service accounts, Microsoft 365 (M365) synchronization accounts, and krbtgt —
will be necessary to remove the actors’ access. (For more information, see
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/87978/reset-krbtgt-password.html).
Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter
expertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that
could enable follow-on exploitation.
FBI and CISA also recommend organizations implement the recommendations listed below
to further reduce the risk of malicious cyber activity.
Security Best Practices
Deploy Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), enforce Server Message Block
(SMB) Signing, restrict Administrative privileges (local admin users, groups, etc.), and
review sensitive materials on domain controller’s SYSVOL share.
Enable increased logging policies, enforce PowerShell logging, and ensure
antivirus/endpoint detection and response (EDR) are deployed to all endpoints and
enabled.

4/7

Routinely verify no unauthorized system modifications, such as additional accounts and
Secure Shell (SSH) keys, have occurred to help detect a compromise. To detect these
modifications, administrators can use file integrity monitoring software that alerts an
administrator or blocks unauthorized changes on the system.
Network Best Practices
Monitor remote access/ RDP logs and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.
Deny atypical inbound activity from known anonymization services, to include
commercial VPN services and The Onion Router (TOR).
Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to
execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.
Regularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access control under the
concept of least privilege.
Regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.
Scan networks for open and listening ports and mediate those that are unnecessary.
Maintain historical network activity logs for at least 180 days, in case of a suspected
compromise.
Identify and create offline backups for critical assets.
Implement network segmentation.
Automatically update anti-virus and anti-malware solutions and conduct regular virus
and malware scans.
Remote Work Environment Best Practices
With an increase in remote work environments and the use of VPN services, the FBI and
CISA encourage organizations to implement the following best practices to improve network
security:
Regularly update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices used for remote
work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.
When possible, implement multi-factor authentication on all VPN connections. Physical
security tokens are the most secure form of MFA, followed by authenticator
applications. When MFA is unavailable, require employees engaging in remote work to
use strong passwords.
Monitor network traffic for unapproved and unexpected protocols.
Reduce potential attack surfaces by discontinuing unused VPN servers that may be
used as a point of entry for attackers.
User Awareness Best Practices
Cyber actors frequently use unsophisticated methods to gain initial access, which can often
be mitigated by stronger employee awareness of indicators of malicious activity. The FBI and
CISA recommend the following best practices to improve employee operations security when
conducting business:
5/7

Provide end-user awareness and training. To help prevent targeted social engineering
and spearphishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of
potential cyber threats and delivery methods. Also, provide users with training on
information security principles and techniques.
Inform employees of the risks associated with posting detailed career information to
social or professional networking sites.
Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see
suspicious activity or suspect a cyberattack, to help quickly and efficiently identify
threats and employ mitigation strategies.
