Arkei is an information-stealer, distributed as a malware as a service (MAAS). It collects
sensitive information such as application passwords, credit card information, web browser
cookies and can even download additional payloads from the C&C server. It also shares
code with several other information stealers including Oski and Vidar.
Arkei Stealer’s main purpose is to collect passwords, cookies, auto-complete data, desktop
files, machine data, installed software, etc. In 2021, Arkei’s authors extended its crypto wallet
stealing capabilities, as well as the addition of anti-debugging and anti-emulation checks, to
thwart its analysis and detection rates.
We analyzed a sample found by @James_inthe_box and created a complete list of the
browsers and crypto browser wallets that Arkei Stealer tries to steal.
First, let's talk about the evasion techniques this stealer performs. Arkei performs two wellknown anti-debugger checks:
1. It calls ntdll!NtQueryInformationProcess with ProcessInformationClass set to 7
(ProcessDebugPort) – this call returns a DWORD value equal to 0xFFFFFFFF ( –1 in
decimal) if the process is being debugged:

2. Timing check using kernel32!GetTickCount function – when debugging in a single-step
mode, a lag occurs while running the executable. Arkei checks a timestamp and compares it
to another one after a few instructions, to check for a delay:

Arkei Stealer employs another evasion technique (akin to Vidar stealer’s anti–emulation
technique), which checks the computer name and the username running the Arkei
executable. The malicious process will terminate itself if the computer name is "HAL9TH"
and the username is "JohnDoe" (which is the default computer name and default username
respectively of the Windows Defender emulator):

Arkei also checks if any of the following DLL’s are loaded into the process:
avghookx.dll - AVG Internet Security.
avghooka.dll - AVG Internet Security.
snxhk.dll – Avast Antivirus.
sbiedll.dll – Sandboxie.
api_log.dll – CWSandbox.
dir_watch.dll - iDefense SysAnalyzer.
pstorec.dll - SunBelt Sandbox.
vmcheck.dll – VirtualPC.
wpespy.dll – Sandbox.
cmdvrt32.dll - COMODO Internet Security.
cmdvrt64.dll - COMODO Internet Security.
This stealer will terminate itself if the language identifier of the Region Format setting of the
current user is one of the following:
43Fh – Kazah
443h - Uzbek - Latin
419h - Russian
82Ch - Azeri-Cyrillic
423h - Belarusian
This might indicate that the author comes from one of the above countries where it is a
common technique, used in order to not draw the attention of the local authorities.
If all the above checks pass successfully, the malware will continue its intended purpose.
Arkei steals passwords, cookies, and autofill information from the following 32 web browsers:

Arkei Stealer is one of the most threatening types of malware for cryptocurrency holders, due
to the vast list of crypto browser wallets the malware can compromise and steal user’s
assets from. Arkei steals these credentials by copying all the files stored in the browser’s
extension folder. For example, if the victim uses Google Chrome with a crypto browser wallet
extension, the extension files will be stored in:

C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Extension
Settings\Extension ID from Google Store
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sync Extension
Settings\ Extension ID from Google Store
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
Data\Default\IndexedDB\Domain Name.indexeddb.leveldb

The sample that we analyzed steals data pertaining to stored browser passwords and 2FA
extensions such as:
Authenticator
Authy
EOS Authenticator
GAuth Authenticator
Trezor Password Manager
This malware takes advantage of the fact that an increasing number of employees use their
organizations’ endpoints for day-to-day activities, such as online purchasing and
cryptocurrency activities. Electronic wallets are becoming increasingly common, making it
easier for end-users to expose the corporate network to external attacks.
Minerva Lab’s Hostile Environment Simulation Module prevents Arkei Stealer from executing
on the victim's PC, protecting the corporate network and user’s private data.
