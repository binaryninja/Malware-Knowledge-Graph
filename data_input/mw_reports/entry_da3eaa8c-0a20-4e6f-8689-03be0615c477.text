The Australian Government is aware of, and responding to, a sustained targeting of
Australian governments and companies by a sophisticated state-based actor.
The title ‘Copy-paste compromises’ is derived from the actor’s heavy use of proof-of-concept
exploit code, web shells and other tools copied almost identically from open source.
The actor has been identified leveraging a number of initial access vectors, with the most
prevalent being the exploitation of public-facing infrastructure — primarily through the use of
remote code execution vulnerabilities in unpatched versions of Telerik UI. Other
vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure leveraged by the actor include exploitation of a
deserialisation vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), a 2019
SharePoint vulnerability and the 2019 Citrix vulnerability.
The actor has shown the capability to quickly leverage public exploit proof-of-concepts to
target networks of interest and regularly conducts reconnaissance of target networks looking
for vulnerable services, potentially maintaining a list of public-facing services to quickly target
following future vulnerability releases. The actor has also shown an aptitude for identifying
development, test and orphaned services that are not well known or maintained by victim
organisations.
When the exploitation of public-facing infrastructure did not succeed, the ACSC has
identified the actor utilising various spearphishing techniques. This spearphishing has taken
the form of:
links to credential harvesting websites
emails with links to malicious files, or with the malicious file directly attached
links prompting users to grant Office 365 OAuth tokens to the actor
use of email tracking services to identify the email opening and lure click-through
events.

Once initial access is achieved, the actor utilised a mixture of open source and custom tools
to persist on, and interact with, the victim network. Although tools are placed on the network,
the actor migrates to legitimate remote accesses using stolen credentials. To successfully
respond to a related compromise, all accesses must be identified and removed.
In interacting with victim networks, the actor was identified making use of compromised
legitimate Australian web sites as command and control servers. Primarily, the command and
control was conducted using web shells and HTTP/HTTPS traffic. This technique rendered
geo-blocking ineffective and added legitimacy to malicious network traffic during
investigations.
During its investigations, the ACSC identified no intent by the actor to carry out any
disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments.
