Resecurity registered an increase in malicious activity targeting law enforcement agencies
at the beginning of Q2 2022.
Threat actors are hacking e-mail accounts belonging to law enforcement officers, their aim
is to leverage the accounts for further malicious purposes. Typically, they leverage social
engineering tactics, however one of the recent trends is to address fake subpoenas and so
called EDR’s (Emergency Data Requests) to major technology companies and onlineservices such as Apple, Facebook (Meta), Snapchat, Discord to maliciously collect
sensitive information about their targets.
Threat actors are looking for billing history, geographical location, phone calls, text history,
and other sensitive details which could be used to leverage extortion or cyberespionage
purposes. Such incidents have become especially notable in cybercriminal group activities
such as LAPSUS$ and Recursion Group.
Resecurity has observed multiple marketplaces in the Dark Web where cybercriminals
have monetized accounts and credentials belonging to police officers of various foreign
countries (e-mails, VPNs, SSO, etc.). One such email account has previously been used
to send fake EDR requests on behalf of the Bangladesh Police which has been recently
covered in a Bloomberg article where the CEO of Resecurity Gene Yoo was quoted. The
price of such accounts is typically not different from any other compromised accounts and
varies in range between $20-$35 but in some cases independent actors with bigger
access may sell it in a range of $1,000-$10,000.

The incident has been timely reported by Resecurity to BGD e-Gov CIRT (Bangladesh eGovernment Computer Incident Response Team) and over 5 compromised law
enforcement accounts have been successfully recovered for further risk mitigation.
One of the biggest concerns – the visible security of the law enforcement IT infrastructure,
which may create a significant risk to our society not just in cyberspace, but in real life too.
Terrorists and extremist groups may leverage such access for malicious purposes.
The trend is continuing, and more law enforcement organizations have been impacted by
cyberattacks this month. Just recently, the Conti ransomware group attacked the
Intelligence Agency in Peru and leaked their data which created a significant precedent in
the security community. Cybercriminals were extorting DIGIMIN, one of the national
agencies, asking for payment in cryptocurrency.

DDOS Secrets - another notable group of threat actors, has released 285,635 leaked
emails from Nauru Police. The motivation of actors was different - hacktivists attempted to
highlight possible abuses endured by asylum-seekers and refugees based on the island
and to make them public.
The bad actor in Dark Web offered for sale Shanghai Police database including 1B+
records about Chinese citizens. Multiple postings have been identified around July 2 with
reference to actor "ChinaDan". According to several sources, the actor was offering 23
Terabytes of data for sale.

Later, this information has been offered by other independent actors for 3 BTC ($60,500).
Using anonymous channels and IM like Telegram the actors were looking to monetize the
stolen data in Dark Web.

July 5, 2022 - the bad actor was offering access to Indian law enforcement portal and
government resources in India. Based on further analysis, the credentials and associated
data offered by the actor were likely compromised by password stealers such as Mars
Stealer, X-Files Stealer or Azorult.

Cybercriminals abuse law enforcement databases and offer various illegal services in Dark
Web creating significant risk for users' privacy. Using unauthorized access or insider
contacts they're able to extract sensitive information and to monetize it in the underground.
July 3, 2022 - there was identified an actor Mr.Eagle selling a "look-up" service for 500
euro (per query / per person).

Last year, the bad actor released a dump of data presumably originating from an unnamed
law enforcement system in Turkey. Notably, 6 years ago a hacker going by the online alias
ROR[RG] has released a large amount of data that belonged to a Turkish National Police
database and it's thought to contain large amounts of sensitive private information.
ROR[RG] is aligned with the Anonymous hacktivist group and has leaked the data that
was supposedly stolen from Turkish General Directorate of Security (EGM) onto a number
of peer-to-peer sites for anyone to download and examine. The data was released through
The Cthulu website, which has been a host of a number of leaks by members of
Anonymous in the past, including a serious hack against a US Police union.

In context of ongoing geopolitical tensions, bad actors are actively attacking law
enforcement WEB-sites leveraging various types of DDoS activity to create protest
narratives.

The bad actor was offering a dump of hacked law enforcement portals in Jamaica. Based
on further assessment, he was able to exploit a MySQL injection vulnerability in one of the
insecure modules of the official Jamaica Federal Police WEB-site.

8/15

Bad actors released a road traffic & vehicle database of Kazakhstan presumably acquired
from a law enforcement system. Such access allows to check car numbers, vehicles
registration, and other PII related to citizens. Such offerings are also available
commercially in Dark Web covering different geographical regions. The cost of "look-up"
varies from $50 to $250.

The bad actor was selling compromised database of WEB-application presumably
belonging to a law enforcement in Indonesia. The stolen data also included internal
communications and law enforcement employee information.

9/15

The bad actors are also offering abuse service of law enforcement agencies, technically
leading to fake incidents notifications and other types of malicious activity. While some of
such tactics may look primitive, unfortunately, they may generate serious damage to
innocent people on practice.

10/15

Resecurity identified multiple underground services selling police reports about individuals
what allows bad actors to collect sensitive information. Such services can be widely used
by foreign intelligence and organized crime to target individuals and organizations of
interest.
