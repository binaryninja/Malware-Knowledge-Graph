Organizations in 31 countries have been targeted in a new wave of attacks which has been
underway since at least October 2016. The attackers used compromised websites or
“watering holes” to infect pre-selected targets with previously unknown malware. There has
been no evidence found yet that funds have been stolen from any infected banks.
The attacks came to light when a bank in Poland discovered previously unknown malware
running on a number of its computers. The bank then shared indicators of compromise
(IOCs) with other institutions and a number of other institutions confirmed that they too had
been compromised.
As reported, the source of the attack appears to have been the website of the Polish
financial regulator. The attackers compromised the website to redirect visitors to an exploit
kit which attempted to install malware on selected targets.
Symantec has blocked attempts to infect customers in Poland, Mexico and Uruguay by the
same exploit kit that infected the Polish banks. Since October, 14 attacks against computers
in Mexico were blocked, 11 against computers in Uruguay, and two against computers in
Poland.

Custom exploit kit
The attackers appear to be using compromised websites to redirect visitors to a customized
exploit kit, which is preconfigured to only infect visitors from approximately 150 different IP
addresses. These IP addresses belong to 104 different organizations located in 31 different
countries. The vast majority of these organizations are banks, with a small number of
telecoms and internet firms also on the list.

Links to Lazarus?
The malware used in the attacks (Downloader.Ratankba) was previously unidentified,
although it was detected by Symantec under generic detection signatures, which are
designed to block any files seen to engage in malicious activities.
Analysis of the malware is still underway. Some code strings seen in the malware used
shares commonalities with code from malware used by the threat group known as Lazarus.
Ratankba was observed contacting eye-watch[.]in for command and control (C&C)
communications. Ratankba was then observed downloading a Hacktool. This Hacktool
shows distinctive characteristics shared with malware previously associated with Lazarus.

Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009, largely focused on
targets in the US and South Korea. Lazarus has been involved in high level financial attacks
before and some of the tools used in the Bangladesh bank heist shared code
similarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to the group.
Further investigation of these attacks is underway and, over time, more evidence may
emerge about the identity and motives of the attackers. After a series of high profile attacks
on banks during 2016, this latest incident provides a timely reminder of the growing range of
threats facing financial institutions.

UPDATE – March 15, 2017:
Further investigation by Symantec into the recent attacks against banks in Poland has
uncovered additional links to the threat group known as Lazarus. At the time of our original
blog, Symantec had found one link: code strings seen in a Hacktool used in the Polish bank
attacks shared distinctive characteristics with malware previously associated with Lazarus.
The number of tentative links Symantec has established has since broadened from one to
four. One piece of malware (MD5:91b2558f5319960c85522dc8e372a2b9) found on a
computer at one of the Polish targets has been previously used and attributed to the
Lazarus group. The previously mentioned Lazarus-linked Hacktool was also found on the
same computer at the Polish target.

In addition to this, a sample of Downloader.Ratankba
(MD5:cb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2), which has only been seen in the 2017 Polish
Bank attacks, was submitted by a Symantec customer for analysis along with a sample of
Backdoor.Destover, the disk-wiping malware linked to Lazarus and used in the Sony
Pictures attacks.
A fourth link is the unique trait "del /a %1", which was found in Downloader.Ratankba. It was
also identified in multiple malware families linked to Lazarus including Backdoor.Joanap and
Backdoor.Destover.
As a result of these findings, Symantec has upgraded its assessment of a Lazarus link. The
crossover in tools used leads us to believe there is a reasonable possibility that the Polish
bank attacks were the work of attackers linked to Lazarus.
