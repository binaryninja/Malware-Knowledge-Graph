Signalling System #7

• Protocol suite used by most telecommunications network operators throughout
the world to talk to each other

• Standardized in the 1980s in ITU-T Q.700 series
• When it was designed, there were only few telecoms operators, and they were
either state controlled or really big corporations

• “Walled Garden” approach: trusted each other, so no authentication built in

SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

Signalling System #7 today

• New protocols added in the 1990s and 2000s by ETSI and 3GPP to support
mobile phones and the services they need (roaming, SMS, data...)

• Mobile Application Part (MAP)
‣ Contains everything mobile phones need that is not call signalling
• CAMEL Application Part (CAP)
‣ New protocol that allows the network operator to build custom services that
are not possible with MAP

• still no authentication for any of this
SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

Signalling System #7 today

• Getting access is easier than ever
‣ Can be bought from telcos or roaming hubs for a few hundred euros a month
‣ Usually (not always), roaming agreements with other networks are needed,
but some telcos are reselling their roaming agreements

‣ Some network operators leave their equipment unsecured on the internet
‣ Femtocells are part of the core network and have been shown to be hackable

Cell-Level Tracking

• The network needs to know which base station (“cell”) is
closest to the subscriber to deliver calls, SMS...

• If you can find out the ID of that cell, it’s geographical position
can be looked up in one of several databases

• The location of the cell tower is also a good approximation of
the subscriber’s location

• In cities, cell towers are so close that subscriber tracking down
to street level is possible

SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

11

Commercial Tracking Providers

• Several commercial providers offer cell-level tracking as service, claim
coverage of about 70% of worldwide mobile subscribers (with some
restrictions...)

• Only the MSISDN (phone number) is required to locate a subscriber

SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

12

Cell Level Tracking with SS7/MAP

• MAP’s anyTimeInterrogation (ATI) service can query the subscriber’s HLR for

her Cell-Id and IMEI (phone serial number, can be used to look up phone type)

Real-life tracking

SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

19

Observations of a German network operator

• The Operator started filtering all network-internal messages at the network’s
borders

• This (combined with SMS home routing, which the operator has in place)
essentially eliminated the simple form of tracking as seen before

• Attack traffic dropped more than 80%:
‣ Some of that traffic was due to misconfiguration at other networks
‣ Commercial use cases:
- a shipping company was tracking its vehicles
- an SMS service provider for banks who use text messages as a second

form of authentication (mTAN) was using the MAP sendIMSI request to find
out if the SIM was recently swapped
SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

20

Observations of a German network operator

• Some of the network operators where the attacks originated either did not
respond or played dumb when the issue was addressed by the German
operator

• The operator believes that those attacks are being performed by state actors or
the other network’s operators themselves

• Some attacks are still happening, which requires other information sources or
brute-forcing to get VLR/MSC and IMSI

SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

21

Location Services (LCS)

• In the US, E911 mandates: “Wireless network operators must provide the
latitude and longitude of callers within 300 meters, within six minutes of a
request by a Public Safety Answering Point”

• LCS can use triangulation to further narrow down a subscriber’s position or
even request a GPS position from the phone (via RRLP)

• Emergency services request a subscriber’s location from the Gateway Mobile
Location Center (GMLC)

• GMLC requires authentication

CAMEL
???

• “Customised Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic”
• Specified in 3GPP TS 23.078
• Like an overlay over usual MAP logic
• Defines a set of events, for which the VLR should contact the CAMEL entity in
the subscriber’s home network (gsmSCF = “GSM Service Control Function)

• The gsmSCF then decides if the desired action can continue unmodified or
modified or will be aborted

• Call forwardings can be set/deleted

rate calls to the subscriber

• Switch active SIM in case of Multi-SIM

Hybrid Attacks: TMSI De-anonymization

• An attacker can find out the phone numbers of subscribers around him:
‣ Paging of subscribers (e.g. to notify them of an incoming call) has to happen
unencrypted

‣ TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identifier) is normally used for paging so
that the real identity of the subscriber (IMSI) does not have to be sent over
the air unencrypted

LTE

• LTE uses the Diameter protocol in the core network
• SS7 is becoming a legacy protocol, but:
‣ A lot of the SS7 design has been ported to Diameter, including its flaws
‣ E.g. there is still no end-to-end authentication for subscribers
‣ GSM/UMTS (and with them SS7) will be around for a long time to come
(probably around 20 years)

• To be able to have connections from GSM/UMTS to LTE, there are interfaces
mapping most of the SS7 functionality (including its flaws) onto Diameter

SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

50

Summary

• An attacker needs SS7 access and (most of the time) SCCP roaming with his
victim’s network

• Then, with only his victim’s phone number, he can
‣ Track his victim’s movements (in some networks with GPS precision)
‣ Intercept his victim’s calls, text messages (and probably data connections, not
verified)

‣ Disable calls, SMS, data
‣ Re-route calls, at the victim’s expense
• With only a TMSI, captured over the air interface, he can
‣ decrypt calls captured off the air (GSM, UMTS)
‣ find out the IMSI and phone number belonging to the TMSI
SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

51

Countermeasures (for operators)

• Network operators should remove all necessities to hand out a subscriber’s
IMSI and current VLR/MSC to other networks

‣ With SMS Home Routing, all text messages traverse an SMS router in the
subscriber’s home network

‣ When the HLR receives sendRoutingInfoForSM request, it only needs to
hand out the address of the SMS router instead of the MSC address

‣ Instead of the subscriber’s IMSI, only a correlation id will be returned (that
can be resolved by the SMS router)

• All MAP and CAP messages only needed internally in the network should be
filtered at the network’s borders

‣ If Optimal Routing is not used, sendRoutingInfo (the one for voice calls,
another source of MSC and IMSI), can also be filtered
SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.

52

Countermeasures (for subscribers)

• Tell your operator to take action
• Throw away phone

• (Sorry, there really isn’t that much you can do)
