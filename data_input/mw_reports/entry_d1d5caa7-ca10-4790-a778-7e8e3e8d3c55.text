NSO Group’s spyware has been used to facilitate human rights violations around the world
on a massive scale, according to a major investigation into the leak of 50,000 phone
numbers of potential surveillance targets. These include heads of state, activists and
journalists, including Jamal Khashoggi’s family.
The Pegasus Project lays bare how NSO’s spyware is a weapon of choice for
repressive governments seeking to silence journalists, attack activists and crush
dissent, placing countless lives in peril.
Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
The Pegasus Project is a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17
media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media
non-profit, with the technical support of Amnesty International, who conducted cutting- edge
forensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of the spyware.
“The Pegasus Project lays bare how NSO’s spyware is a weapon of choice for repressive
governments seeking to silence journalists, attack activists and crush dissent, placing
countless lives in peril,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“These revelations blow apart any claims by NSO that such attacks are rare and down to
rogue use of their technology. While the company claims its spyware is only used for
legitimate criminal and terror investigations, it’s clear its technology facilitates systemic
abuse. They paint a picture of legitimacy, while profiting from widespread human rights
violations.”
“Clearly, their actions pose larger questions about the wholesale lack of regulation that has
created a wild west of rampant abusive targeting of activists and journalists. Until this
company and the industry as a whole can show it is capable of respecting human rights,
there must be an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer and use of surveillance
technology.”
In a written response to Forbidden Stories and its media partners, NSO Group said it “firmly
denies… false claims” in the report. It wrote that the consortium’s reporting was based on
“wrong assumptions” and “uncorroborated theories” and reiterated that the company was on
1/4

a “life-saving mission”. A fuller summary of NSO Group’s response is available here.

The Investigation
At the centre of this investigation is NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware which, when
surreptitiously installed on victims’ phones, allows an attacker complete access to the
device’s messages, emails, media, microphone, camera, calls and contacts.
Over the next week, media partners of The Pegasus Project – including The Guardian, Le
Monde, Süddeutsche Zeitung and The Washington Post – will run a series of stories
exposing details of how world leaders, politicians, human rights activists, and journalists
have been selected as potential targets of this spyware.
From the leaked data and their investigations, Forbidden Stories and its media partners
identified potential NSO clients in 11 countries: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India,
Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).
NSO Group has not taken adequate action to stop the use of its tools for unlawful targeted
surveillance of activists and journalists, despite the fact that it either knew, or arguably ought
to have known, that this was taking place.
The Pegasus Project revelations must act as a catalyst for change. The surveillance
industry must no longer be afforded a laissez-faire approach from governments with a
vested interest in using this technology to commit human rights violations.

“As a first step, NSO Group must immediately shut down clients’ systems where there is
credible evidence of misuse. The Pegasus Project provides this in abundance,” said Agnès
Callamard.

Khashoggi family targeted
During the investigation, evidence has also emerged that family members of Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi were targeted with Pegasus software before and after his murder in
Istanbul on 2 October 2018 by Saudi operatives, despite repeated denials from NSO Group.
Amnesty International’s Security Lab established that Pegasus spyware was successfully
installed on the phone of Khashoggi’s fiancée Hatice Cengiz just four days after his murder.
His wife, Hanan Elatr was also repeatedly targeted with the spyware between September
2017 and April 2018 as well as his son, Abdullah, who was also selected as a target along
with other family members in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

In a statement, the NSO Group responded to the Pegasus Project allegations saying that its
“technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi”.
The company said that it “previously investigated this claim, immediately after the heinous
murder, which again, is being made without validation”.
Journalists under attack
The investigation has so far identified at least 180 journalists in 20 countries who were
selected for potential targeting with NSO spyware between 2016 to June 2021, including in
Azerbaijan, Hungary, India and Morocco, countries where crackdowns against independent
media have intensified.
The revelations show the real-world harm caused by unlawful surveillance:
In Mexico, journalist Cecilio Pineda’s phone was selected for targeting just weeks
before his killing in 2017. The Pegasus Project identified at least 25 Mexican journalists
were selected for targeting over a two-year period. NSO has denied that even if
Pineda’s phone had been targeted, data collected from his phone contributed to his
death.
Pegasus has been used in Azerbaijan, a country where only a few independent media
outlets remain. More than 40 Azerbaijani journalists were selected as potential targets
according to the investigation. Amnesty International’s Security Lab found the phone of
Sevinc Vaqifqizi, a freelance journalist for independent media outlet Meydan TV, was
infected over a two-year period until May 2021.
In India, at least 40 journalists from nearly every major media outlet in the country were
selected as potential targets between 2017-2021. Forensic tests revealed the phones
of Siddharth Varadarajan and MK Venu, co-founders of independent online outlet The
Wire, were infected with Pegasus spyware as recently as June 2021.
The investigation also identified journalists working for major international media
including the Associated Press, CNN, The New York Times and Reuters as potential
targets. One of the highest profile journalists was Roula Khalaf, the editor of the
Financial Times.
“The number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how Pegasus is used as a
tool to intimidate critical media. It is about controlling public narrative, resisting scrutiny, and
suppressing any dissenting voice,” said Agnès Callamard.
“These revelations must act as a catalyst for change. The surveillance industry must no
longer be afforded a laissez-faire approach from governments with a vested interest in using
this technology to commit human rights violations.”
Exposing Pegasus infrastructure
Amnesty International is today releasing the full technical details of its Security Lab’s indepth forensic investigations as part of the Pegasus Project.

The Lab’s methodology report documents the evolution of Pegasus spyware attacks since
2018, with details on the spyware’s infrastructure, including more than 700 Pegasus-related
domains.
“NSO claims its spyware is undetectable and only used for legitimate criminal investigations.
We have now provided irrefutable evidence of this ludicrous falsehood,” said Etienne
Maynier, a technologist at Amnesty International’s Security Lab.
There is nothing to suggest that NSO’s customers did not also use Pegasus in terrorism and
crime investigations, and the Forbidden Stories consortium also found numbers in the data
belonging to suspected criminals.
“The widespread violations Pegasus facilitates must stop. Our hope is the damning evidence
published over the next week will lead governments to overhaul a surveillance industry that
is out of control,” said Etienne Maynier.
In response to a request for comment by media organizations involved in the Pegasus
Project, NSO Group said it “firmly denies” the claims and stated that “many of them are
uncorroborated theories which raise serious doubts about the reliability of your sources, as
well as the basis of your story.” NSO Group did not confirm or deny which governments are
NSO Group’s customers, although it said that the Pegasus Project had made “incorrect
assumptions” in this regard. Notwithstanding its general denial of the claims, NSO Group
said it “will continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action
based on the results of these investigations”.
