Introduction
• This talk focuses on the methodology of sample pivoting
• Examples are based on a real case investigation published on
April 09, 2021 in the Trend Micro blog
Iron Tiger APT Updates Toolkit With Evolved SysUpdate
Malware
• Goal:
• Find more samples/IOCs of a particular malware
family/threat actor

Introduction
• Investigation started in December 2020, after Talent-Jump
technologies brought an unknown sample to us
• Sample was found in the same gambling company that was
targeted during Operation DRBControl
• At the time, we found links to 3 different threat actors

classification

Malware analysis and classification
• 4 files:
•
•
•
•

dlpumgr32.exe: legitimate signed file, part of the DESlock+ product
DLPPREM32.DLL: malicious side-loaded DLL file loading DLPPREM32.bin
DLPPREM32.bin: shellcode decompressing and loading a “launcher”
data.res: encrypted file containing the final payload, decoded by the
“launcher”

After analysis, a fifth file is involved, config.res. It contains the C&C

Malware analysis and classification
• The unpacked code can be dumped from memory
• We look for patterns to identify the malware family
• Uncommon strings/constants
• Noteworthy encryption/obfuscation algorithm

 There is a hardcoded user-agent which is listed in a Dell
Secureworks blogpost

Malware analysis and classification
• The blogpost mentions multiple tools from the BRONZE
UNION (Iron Tiger) threat actor
• SysUpdate is mentioned, and as far as we know, exclusive to
the Iron Tiger threat actor

• We found a detailed description of SysUpdate in a NCC
group blogpost that matches the behavior of the “launcher”

Pivoting

Pivoting – filenames
• Two loading scenarios found in previous blogs

10

Pivoting – filenames
• Search engines
• Few sandbox results, but the hashes were already known

• Malware repositories (Virus Total and internal)
• 8 results, of which 7 were not listed in the two mentioned reports

• Searching those new samples lead to two additional reports:
• One published by AE.CERT on June 13th, 2019
• One published by Iranian private company on March 2020
 History of previous targets (Iran, UAE)

11

Pivoting – filenames
• New loading scenarios/filenames in those reports

12

Pivoting – filenames
• Pivoting on DLL filenames is trickier
• Filenames are used by legitimate files
• The same legitimate executables can be abused by multiple threat
actors

• Filtering on metadata such as file size reduces the number of
results
• “name:PYTHON33.DLL”: 129 results
• “name:PYTHON33.dll size:100Kb-”: 6 results (3 FP)

13

Pivoting – filenames
• New filenames lead to additional reports from multiple
companies or even researchers

14

Pivoting – imphash
• “Import hashing”, or imphash, is a method disclosed by
Mandiant/FireEye in 2014
• It relies on the Import Address Table (IAT), which is built by
the linker at compilation time
• The IAT will be different depending on
• The order in which the functions are called in the source code
• The order in which the source files are parsed by the linker

• The output of the imphash algorithm is an MD5 hash
15

Pivoting – imphash
• Virus Total and Malware Bazaar provide a search keyword:
• imphash: <imphash value>

• Yara has a function to calculate it in the “pe” module:
• pe.imphash() == <imphash value>

• There is a stand-alone Python implementation

16

Pivoting – imphash
• PYTHON33.DLL file from Iranian report has imphash
509a3352028077367321fbf20f39f6d9
• Virus Total returns 3 files with such imphash
• 2 files are named “GameuxInstallHelper.dll”

• There may be false positives, especially for small files

17

Pivoting – RICH header
• Metadata inserted in PE files by Microsoft compilers, first
documented in 2010
• Contains information on the building environment (Product
ID, version, count)

• XORed with a key which is a checksum of some headers

18

Pivoting – RICH header
• Two files with a similar RICH header may be generated in the
same build environment
• By searching for similar RICH headers, we might find
additional samples from the same threat actor

• Simplest approach for pivoting is to calculate a MD5 hash of
the unxored RICH header
19

Pivoting – RICH header
• Virus Total has a search modifier for this
• rich_pe_header_hash:<RICH header’s MD5>

• For other platforms, a Yara rule can be used for this
• hash.md5(pe.rich_signature.clear_data) == <RICH header’s MD5>

• Or you can use a stand-alone Python implementation

20

Pivoting – RICH header
• inicore_v2.3.30.dll from Palo Alto’s blogpost has RICH
header’s hash 5503d2d1e505a487cbc37b6ed423081f
• Virus Total returns 3 results for this hash
• 2 files are named “GameuxInstallHelper.dll”

21

Pivoting – RICH header
• The RICH header is not needed for proper code execution
• It can be removed, modified, copied, forged…

• Famous example of false flag involving RICH header in 2018
• The RICH header from a sample attributed to Lazarus group was
copied to a sample from the Olympic Destroyer campaign

22

Pivoting – Stolen certificates
• PE files can be signed via the Authenticode technology
• It identifies the publisher of the file, and guarantee that the
code has not been tampered
• It relies on certificates, managed by certification authorities

23

Pivoting – Stolen certificates
• Private keys are sometimes stolen, allowing threat actors to
sign malicious code
• Certification authorities revoke the certificate once notified
• Searching for all executables signed by a stolen certificate is a
good pivot
• Keep in mind that all results are not malicious
24

Pivoting – Stolen certificates
• Virus Total has a search keyword:
• signature: <any metadata in the certificate, thumbprint, serial, CN
field…>

• Malware Bazaar has a two search keywords:
• serial_number: <certificate’ serial number>
• issuer_cn: <certificate’s issuer>

25

Pivoting – Stolen certificates
• Yara can parse certificates in the “pe” module:
for any i in (0 .. pe.number_of_signatures): (
pe.signatures[i].serial == <certificate’s serial number in low case>
or pe.signatures[i].thumbprint == <certificate’s thumbprint in low case>

)

26

Pivoting – Stolen certificates
• inicore_v2.3.30.dll from Palo Alto’s blogpost is signed by a
“Kepware Technologies” certificate
• Virus Total returns 9 results with this serial number
• All are related to Iron Tiger

27

Pivoting – TLSH
• TLSH is a “fuzzy hashing” algorithm
• Split the input in blocks of variable length and makes a hash out of it

• Output is a 72-character long hash
• Mixed results, although better than with other fuzzy hashing
algorithms

28

© 2021 Trend Micro Inc.

Pivoting – TLSH
• Virus Total and Malware Bazaar provide a search keyword:
• tlsh: <TLSH value>

• Yara does not have a way to calculate this hash
• The code is open source and can be applied to a local
malware repository

29

Pivoting – TLSH
• Wsocks32.dll from Dell SecureWorks blogpost has TLSH
T112F21A0172A28477E1AE2A3424B592725D7F7C416AF040CB3F9916FA9FB16D0DA3C367

• More than 200 results, some of them are related, most are not

• PYTHON33.dll from Palo Alto blogpost has TLSH
T17A634B327C97D8B7E1D97AB858A2DA12152F250059F588C9BF7043E70F2A6509E37F0E

• 3 related results in Virus Total, one named “GameuxInstallHelper.dll”

Conclusion – Results
• Started from one sample found in 2020…
• …ended with 38 unpacked SysUpdate samples

• The oldest one has a compilation timestamp of March 2015,
some of them were uploaded in 2016

Conclusion – Takeaways
• Many techniques enable malware sample correlation
• These techniques have flaws (collisions, based on forgeable
fields), but are still useful
• Threat actors make mistakes, they improve, and so does the
threat intelligence field

33

Conclusion – Takeaways
• Confrontation with other sources (infrastructure, TTPs,
political agenda) is mandatory to avoid false flags
• Everyone does mistakes. Acknowledge and fix them and you will be
fine

• Sharing is caring, public research reports are useful if they
contain enough actionable information
