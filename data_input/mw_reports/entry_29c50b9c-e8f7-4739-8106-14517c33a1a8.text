Today, ESET researchers reveal a family of Linux malware that stayed under the radar for
more than 5 years. We have named this family Linux/Mumblehard. A white paper about this
threat is available for download on WeLiveSecuriy.
There are two components in the Mumblehard malware family: a backdoor and a
spamming daemon. They are both written in Perl and feature the same custom packer
written in assembly language. The use of assembly language to produce ELF binaries so as
to obfuscate the Perl source code shows a level of sophistication higher than average.

Monitoring of the botnet suggests that the main purpose of Mumblehard seems to be to
send spam messages by sheltering behind the reputation of the legitimate IP addresses of
the infected machines.
The relationship between the components and their command and control servers are
illustrated in the following diagram:

Prevalence
ESET Researchers were able to monitor the Mumblehard backdoor component by
registering a domain name used as one of the C&C servers. More than 8,500 unique IP
addresses hit the sinkhole with Mumblehard behavior while we were observing the
requests coming in. The following chart shows the number of unique IP addresses seen
each day over that period.

We can see from the chart that during the first week of April, more than 3,000 machines
were affected by Mumblehard. The number of infected hosts is slowly decreasing, but the
overall view shows that infection happens at specific times and that the botnet size has
doubled over a 6-month period.
A quick look at the list of victims suggests that Mumblehard mostly targets web servers.

Links with Yellsoft
Our analysis and research also shows a strong link between Mumblehard and Yellsoft.
Yellsoft sells software, written in Perl, designed to send bulk e-mails. This program is called
DirectMailer. The first link between them is that the IP addresses used as C&C servers for
both the backdoor and spamming components are located in the same range as the web
server hosting yellsoft.net. The second link is that we have found pirated copies of
DirectMailer online that actually silently install the Mumblehard backdoor when run. The
pirated copies were also obfuscated by the same packer used by Mumblehard’s malicious
components.

Prevention
Victims should look for unsolicited cronjob entries for all the users on their servers. This
is the mechanism used by the Mumblehard backdoor to activate the backdoor every 15
minutes. The backdoor is usually installed in /tmp or /var/tmp. Mounting the tmp directory
with the noexec option prevents the backdoor from starting in the first place.
