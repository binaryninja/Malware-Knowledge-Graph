distributing other malware variants like Gootkit, Ursniff and more.

the UK.
A new malware downloader dubbed sLoad has been discovered active in the wild. The
malware downloader comes packed with sophisticated reconnaissance capabilities and has
been distributing the notorious Ramnit banking trojan.
The malware duo is being leveraged by a threat group called TA554, who has been targeting
financial institutions across Italy, Canada and the UK. TA554 has been active since 2017.
However, its latest campaign began in May 2018.

sLoad capabilities
sLoad is capable of conducting reconnaissance operations such as gathering system
information like a list of running processes, the presence of Outlook, and the presence of
Citrix-related files. sLoad is also capable of checking the DNS cache for a particular domain,
such as that of a targeted bank. What is more, the malware downloader can also take
screenshots and load external binaries.

“After the initial beacon, sLoad enters a loop in which it pushes extensive information about
the victim’s system to the C&C, expects and executes commands from the server, and sends
screenshots to the server. In this loop, it first performs a request to “captcha.php” and sends
information about the infected system via the URL parameters,” security researchers at
Proofpoint, who discovered the new campaign, wrote in a blog.

Modus operandi
TA554’s campaign involves sending victims cleverly crafted emails, which contain language
that is native to the targeted country. The phishing emails also often mention the target’s
name and address in various parts of the email, such as the email subject and body. The
threat group generally uses package delivery or order notification as lures.
The phishing emails contain malicious URLs that link to zipped LNK files, which, in turn,
download the final payloads, which could either be a PowerShell script or another malware
downloader.
“Geofencing -- restricting access to content based on the user’s location, determined via the
source IP address -- is performed at all steps of the infection chain,” Proofpoint researchers
said.
Apart from Ramnit, sLoad has so far also been used to distribute other malware variants
such as Gootkit, Ursnif, DarkVNC, PsiXBot, and more. The researchers said that since May,
they have observed multiple new versions of sLoad, all of which contained some minor
modifications.
“sLoad, like other downloaders we have profiled recently, fingerprints infected systems,
allowing threat actors to better choose targets of interest for the payloads of their choice. In
this case, that final payload is generally a banking Trojan via which the actors can not only
steal additional data but perform man-in-the-browser attacks on infected individuals,”
Proofpoint researchers added. “Downloaders, though, like sLoad, Marap, and others, provide
high degrees of flexibility to threat actors, whether avoiding vendor sandboxes, delivering
ransomware to a system that appears mission critical, or delivering a banking Trojan to
systems with the most likely return.”
