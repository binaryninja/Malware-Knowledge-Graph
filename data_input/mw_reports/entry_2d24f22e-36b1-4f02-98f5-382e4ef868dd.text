According to new research by Kaspersky's GReAT team, the online criminal activities of the
Roaming Mantis Group have continued to evolve since they were first discovered in April
2018. As part of their activities, this group hacks into exploitable routers and changes their

DNS configuration. This allows the attackers to redirect the router user's traffic to malicious
Android apps disguised as Facebook and Chrome or to Apple phishing pages that were
used to steal Apple ID credentials.
Recently, Kaspersky has discovered that this group is testing a new monetization scheme
by redirecting iOS users to pages that contain the Coinhive in-browser mining script rather
than the normal Apple phishing page. When users are redirected to these pages, they will
be shown a blank page in the browser, but their CPU utilization will jump to 90% or higher.

Coinhive
This is caused by the page utilizing the Coinhive mining script shown below.

The day after the GReAT discovered this new page, the attackers reverted back to
redirecting to the Apple phishing page, so this appears to be a test that is not ready for full
release.

Limited hacking of Japanese devices
After Japanese researchers started releasing reports regarding Roaming Mantis, the group
is making an effort to avoid hacking Japanese devices.
On landing pages that users were redirected to, Kaspersky noticed that there was
JavaScript that checked if the device's language was set to "ja" or Japanese. If the ja
language was detected, the page would not offer any malicious applications or redirects to
the visitor.

Spreading via scam adverts on Prezi.com
This group appears to also be taking a page out of the Adware handbook by promoting
scam sites for adult videos, games, music, and downloads.
These scam sites are being promoted through Prezi.com, a presentation sharing site,
where the group would create page that contain links to URLS at https://tinyurl.com. When
a visitor goes to these urls, though, they will be redirected to various scam sites as shown
below.

Protecting your devices
To protect yourself from attacks like this, make sure that your routers are upgraded to the
latest firmware so that any vulnerabilities are patched. Kaspersky also suggests that
Android users turn off the ability to install app from third-party sites.
"We strongly recommend that Android users turn off the option that allows installation of
applications from third-party repositories, to keep their device safe," stated Kaspersky's
research. "They should also be suspicious if their phones become unusually hot, which may
be a side-effect of the hidden crypto-mining application in action."
