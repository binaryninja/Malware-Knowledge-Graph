Introduction
The criminal culture of theft that has been injected into virtually every line of China’s 13th
Five-Year Plan is unprecedented. From state sponsored smash and grab hacking and
techno-pilfering, to corporate espionage and targeted theft of IP, the threat is real, the
economic implications are devastating and Western Nations are the primary target of
China’s desperate effort to steal in order to globally compete. Never before in recorded
history has IP transfer occurred at such a rapid velocity.
The all-encompassing, multifaceted onslaught of cyber-physical Chinese espionage targets
industry genres from satcom to defense and from academic research to regional factories
manufacturing proprietary blends of industrial materials. China seeks to not only steal but
to economically interrupt and cripple. Economic warfare is just as much a part of the
strategy as catching up to Western innovation and becoming less dependent on foreign
technology. Chinese student and scholar associations, trade organizations, legions of
strategically placed insider threats and yes, even criminal organizations such as the Triad,
all play their key role in the purloining of intellectual property in contribution to the
Chinese agenda. This report covers the primary structure of Chinese espionage initiatives.
China’s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan
China’s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) focuses on cutting edge technology and
socio-economic reform. The plan calls for innovative technology to improve national
infrastructure and more environmentally friendly technology to alleviate China’s ecological
footprint. By 2025, China wants to improve its national technological core, reduce the
global perception that its products are of inferior quality (likely by improving their quality
by modernizing the underlying manufacturing infrastructure), and diversify its domestic
industrial markets. While China will develop some of the technology necessary to aspire
towards these goals as the result of the intellectual endeavors of its people, the majority
will likely be obtained as stolen intellectual property from the United States and other
nations. As ICIT Fellow John Sabin (GRA Quantum) observed “When you understand
China’s desire to be a global leader across markets, you can rationalize their preference to
simply steal intellectual property. Say, for example, they want to become the world leader
in pharmaceuticals. Instead of investing billions of dollars supporting science education
and the development of a robust and innovative biomedical industry, China can simply
leverage what it already has a competitive advantage in – hacking – and steal an American
company’s drug formula in a fraction of the time.” The remainder of the plan focuses on
balancing welfare gaps and bridging socio-economic differences. Since it is unlikely that the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will reform its structure to support a more inclusive
approach to governance, attempts at improving the standard of living of the Chinese people
will likely be gleaned from organizational, structural, and operational models created from
dossiers and data exfiltrated from systems belonging to Western organizations. In short,
like its predecessors, a majority of China’s Thirteenth Plan depends on sustained espionage
against countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Economic Impact of Intellectual Property Theft
The United States is built upon an intangible economy. Gone are the days when American
currency was backed by gold or silver; now, it is backed by ideas. The entire United States
economy relies on some form of intellectual property because every industry either
produces or uses it. In their March 2012 Intellectual Property and the U.S. Economy:
Industries in Focus report, the Economics and Statistics Administration of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office identified 75 out of 313 industries as IP -intensive. These accounted
for 27.1 million jobs, or 18.8% of all employment in 2010. 12.9 million more supply chain
jobs were indirectly supported by intellectual property. IP-intensive industries accounted
for $5.06 trillion in value added or roughly 34.8 % of the U.S. GDP in 2010. Some
researchers estimate that as much as an immediate $300-500 billion and 1.2 million jobs
are lost every year due to the theft of intellectual property. These costs may be much
greater in consideration of the losses over the potential lifetime of the property.
In September 2015, President Obama and President Xi Jinping revealed in a joint media
conference that the United States and China had reached a deal that neither government
would conduct cyberattacks to steal intellectual property for economic gain from the other.
The agreement recognized that neither Obama nor Xi could guarantee the actions of all
their citizens. Many security researchers and legislators doubted that the agreement would
alter the behavior of China in cyberspace. In late June 2016, FireEye’s Ryan Brichant
commented, “Since mid-2014, we have seen a notable decline in China-based groups'
overall intrusion activity against entities in the U.S. and 25 other countries. We suspect that
this shift in operations reflects the influence of ongoing military reforms, widespread
exposure of Chinese cyber operations and actions taken by the U.S. Government. In 2013,
FireEye observed 70 active network compromises by China-based groups each month. In
2015, we observed less than 10 active network compromises. In 2014, the U.S.
Government began to take unprecedented measures in response to claims of Beijing's
cyber-enabled economic espionage. Although many in the U.S. initially doubted that these
actions would have any effect, they may have prompted Beijing to reconsider the execution
of its network operations. We have not seen evidence of a coordinated shift in the behavior
of recently active China-based groups; tactical changes appear to be specific to each group’s
mission and resources, and in response to public exposure of its cyber operations.” While it
is possible that China has reduced its targeted attacks against American organizations, it
seems more likely that it restructured its cyber operations to assert greater control over its
operatives.
Prior to the agreement, the Chinese cyber army operated on several tiers. The first tier
consists of the members of the Third Department, state-sponsored APT groups, and other
cyber professionals, hired by the military to conduct offensive and defensive cyber
operations. The second tier consists of specialists in civilian organizations, such as the
Ministry of State Security or Ministry of Public Security, who are authorized by the military
to conduct cyber operations. The third tier consists of external groups that can be hired or
mobilized to conduct cyber operations. This would include cyber criminals, mercenary

6

groups, and script kiddies who occasionally work with the higher tiers. Finally, beneath all
the tiers are an estimated 500,000 paid propaganda proponents and other internet users
who promote the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders, while criticizing its enemies
online. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) does not fully cover the operating expenses
and modernization funds of the departments. Prior to the agreement, the departments
supplemented budgets with other activities, such as conducting cyberattacks. When Xi
Jinping announced at the beginning of September 2015, that he was cutting 300,000 troops,
his intent was multi-purposed. On one hand, he may have planned to purge the military of
less loyal members and on the other hand, he focused the departments and ordered them
to cease extra ventures, such as sloppy cyberattacks, that could result in economic
sanctions against China. This also could have resulted in less work for the lower tiers as
Chinese state cyberattacks would be more professional, more difficult to detect, and more
focused on high priority targets. It is possible that the financially motivated attacks were
simply redirected. Kaspersky Lab alleges that in response to the agreement, Chinese APT
attacks against Russian targets increased 300 percent between December 2015 and
February 2016. In further support of the possibility that the agreement either spurred
fiscal operations out of the government or incited outsourcing, evidence suggests that the
early 2016 increase in ransomware attacks may have been conducted by Chinese
operatives. Four separate security firms concluded that tools and tactics previously
associated with Chinese government-supported cyber-intrusions were used in some
attacks.
It is important to recognize that the September agreement only pertains to attacks
conducted for economic gain. Neither nation is barred from launching cyberattacks
intended to steal intellectual property or data for any other purpose, such as the
development of infrastructure, military, or technology capabilities. Traditional espionage
attacks against government organizations, such as OPM, Anthem, or federal databases, are
not addressed by the agreement. Even if the agreement did holistically address
cyberattacks, it would be difficult to prevent the first tier from outsourcing attacks to the
lower tiers.
The Structure of Chinese Espionage
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the political body
consisting of the most powerful members of the Communist Party of China. The Committee
is the highest authority when the National Congress is not in session. The Central
Committee is comprised of 205 full members and 171 alternate members. The Central
Committee conducts intelligence operations through a covert and an overt spy structure.
Covert Spy Structure
The CCP controls the People’s Liberation Army through a Central Military Commission
(CMC). The Commission is the parallel national defense agency of the Communist Party of
China and the People’s Republic of China. The CMC is an 11-man commission and its

7

chairman is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Xi Jinping at the time of this
writing. The CMC sets military policies and issues directives relating to the PLA.
Joint Staff Department
The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Joint Staff Department (JSD) replaced the General
Staff Department on January 11, 2016 as part of Xi Jinping’s military reforms. It manages
the majority of military and covert operations. The JSD, as a division of the PLA, is
dedicated to warfare. The duties of the PLA JSD include PLA Operations Command,
Recruitment, Mobilization, Formation, Training, and Administration. The JSD contains three
departments, which cooperate to conduct intelligence operations. The fact that human
intelligence, signal intelligence, and electronic intelligence are all housed under the same,
military department demonstrates that the Chinese view the modern threat landscape as a
cyber-physical battlefield.
Second Department
The Second Department handles conventional human intelligence (HUMINT), such as highlevel spies and intelligence assets. A common misconception is that agents of Chinese
government are “sloppy”; however, agents of the second department who serve as highlevel spies or handlers are rarely caught. Rather, low-level assets, often belonging to the
overt structure are more often detected by foreign intelligence agencies. It is believed that
the Second Department consists of 30,000- 50,000 human spies who are operating as
insider threats within various foreign organizations.
Under the current Five Year Plan, much of the Second Department’s efforts are focused on
the aggregation of intellectual property and intelligence. In some cases, agents of the
second department operate in concert with hackers and APT groups in the Third
Department, by acting as insider threats or otherwise facilitating the compromise of target
systems.
Third Department
The Third Department is responsible for signals intelligence (SIGNIT). The Third
Department is the largest intelligence agency in the Chinese government, consisting of an
estimated 250,000- 300,000 linguists, technical staff, and cyber soldiers. There are at least
four known Research Institutes (56, 57, 58, and 61) under the Third Department. Within
the 61 Research Institute are approximately 20 bureaus that launch cyberattacks. The
Third Department intercepts phone calls, launches cyberattacks, and monitors
communications. Much of its efforts involve hacking devices and exfiltrating targeted data.
The Third Department may launch obvious cyberattacks, such as DDoS or ransomware
attacks, against target systems to mask the activity of Second Department operatives.
Fourth Department
The Fourth Department conducts electronic intelligence (ELINT) operations and is focused
on intercepting satellite and radar data. Fourth Department operations might involve

8

altering, jamming, or spoofing signals. It is believed that the Fourth Department researches
direct methods of disabling enemy communication networks.
State-Sponsored APTs
Chinese state sponsored advanced persistent threats can be identified based on their
choice of targets, their proclivity for cyberespionage, and the language settings on the
keyboards used to develop the malware, and their connections to other campaigns. Some
groups, such as APT 1 (Unit 61398), APT 2 (Unit 61486) and APT 30 (Unit 78020) can be
linked to specific units within the Third Department. Other APTs remain less defined.
Below are some brief profiles of Chinese APTs. Despite the catalog below and those
included in ICIT’s Know Your Enemies reports, even more Chinese state-sponsored APTs
remain undiscovered at the time of this writing.
PLA Unit 61398/ APT 1/ Comment Panda/ Comment Crew/ TG-8223
In 2013, Mandiant published their 60-page report, APT 1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber
Espionage Units, detailing the activities and location of a Chinese state-sponsored advanced
persistent threat and associated organizations that were conducting cyberattacks against
American organizations and government agencies from a 12-story building on the outskirts
of Shanghai. APT 1, or Unit 61398, is the Second Operational Bureau of the Third
Department of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department (GSD). It
operates from four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong district of
Shanghai. Additionally, the Chinese government provides a direct fiber optic connection to
the facility in the name of national defense. On May 19, 2014 a Federal grand jury indicted
five officers of Unit 61398 (Huang Zhenyu, Wen Xinyu, Sun Kailiang, Gu Chunhui, and Wang
Dong) on charges of compromising American systems and stealing intellectual property.
Federal prosecutors listed some suspected targets as Alcoa Inc., Allegheny Technologies
Inc., United States Steel Corp, the Toshiba Corp unit of Westinghouse Electric Co, the U.S.
subsidiaries of SolarWorld AG, and a steel workers' union. The indictment alleges that
Chinese state-owned companies hired Unit 61398 to provide information technology
services, including assembling a database of corporate intelligence, concerning the targets.
The use of a military signal intelligence division to aid state owned businesses
demonstrates a clear difference between strategic cyber operations in the United States
versus China. The United States relies on its cyber operations for defense and some military
intelligence; meanwhile, China utilizes its cyber capabilities for business, socio-economic,
and military purposes.
Unit 61398 targets sectors that are of interest to China’s current Five Year Plan. Primary
targets include intellectual property, trade secrets, financial data, organizational data or
systems in the Information Technology, Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Manufacturing, Public
Administration, or other governmental or technical sectors. It is large enough and wellresourced enough that it can simultaneously compromise dozens of organizations. Attacks
from the group may date back as early as 2002. At the very least, the group has attacked
over a thousand corporations and government entities across the globe since 2006. At least

9

several hundred of those attacks have resulted in severe breaches. The majority of the
targets have been American; however, Dell Secure Works and other firms allege that the
group has also targeted systems belonging to the United Nations, Canada, South Korea,
Taiwan, and Vietnam.
APT 1 received some of its names, such as Comment Crew, Comment Panda, and similar
titles, due to its tendency to infiltrate organizations by compromising the “comment”
features of legitimate web applications in order to laterally navigate to internal
applications or systems. More recent attacks have used personalized spear phishing emails
that contain a malicious file or link. Attachments are usually ZIP files.
Once the victim system is compromised, the attacker establishes a persistent presence by
installing a backdoor from the dropper delivered from the email. The backdoor bypasses
internal security by contacting C2 infrastructure from inside the network. The actor
typically relies upon WEBC2 or BISCUIT backdoors. WEBC2 is a minimally featured
beachhead backdoor that can only communicate with a C2C server through comments.
BISCUIT backdoors are used if more functionality is needed. BISCUIT uses the HTTP
protocol for communication and it features modules to capture screenshots, log keystrokes,
record system information, modify processes, modify the registry, execute code, log off or
shut down the session, and other features. Unit 61398 remains persistent on the
compromised system for months or years. During this time, the group gathers login
credentials from publicly available tools built into the initial malware and escalates account
privileges, conducts network reconnaissance and laterally explores the network to infect
new systems. Unit 61398 compresses stolen data into multiple files with a RAR archiving
utility and exfiltrates the data through their backdoor or through File Transfer Protocol
(FTP).
PLA Unit 61486/ APT2/ Putter Panda/ TG-6952
The advanced persistent threat known as Putter Panda, or PLA Military Unit Cover
Designator (MUCD) 61486, is internally known as the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA)
Third Joint Staff Department (JSD) Twelfth Bureau. The group has been active since at least
2007 and it is based out of the Zhabai district of Shanghai. Unit 61486 shares some
infrastructure with Unit 61398. Analysts of Project 2049 Institute allege that Unit 61486
supports China’s space surveillance network and maintains close ties with the statesponsored Beijing Remote Sensing Research Institute, whose mission is to explore “leading
technologies in earth observation and the mechanisms for acquiring and distributing
remote sensing information.” The cyber targets of Unit 61486 tend to be affiliated with
satellite, aerospace, or defense technologies.
Much like Unit 61398, Putter Panda targets intellectual property, trade secrets, and other
data related to government entities, the Aerospace sector, the Defense sector, the
Communication sector, the Technologies sector, and research facilities. According to
CrowdStrike, the United States Defense industry, communication industries, and European
satellite and aerospace industries are particularly targeted.

10

Like most APTs, Putter Panda relies on spear phishing emails containing malicious PDFs
and Microsoft Word Documents to infect target systems. Its exploit kit includes two
droppers, two RATs, and two tools. One dropper delivers a payload, such as the 4H RAT, to
the victim system and installs it. The other dropper exclusively delivers the PNGDOWNER
tool. Putter Panda uses the 4H RAT and the 3PARA RAT. The 4H RAT can initiate a remote
shell, enumerate running processes, terminate processes, list files and directories, modify
timestamps, upload files, download files, and delete files. The RAT communicates over
HTTP and the communication is obfuscated by an operation, 1-byte XOR with the key 0xBE.
The 3PARA RAT is a second stage, failsafe tool that allows the attacker to regain control of
the system if their initial access vector is removed. The 3PARA RAT creates a file map at
startup to verify that there is not another instance of the RAT running. The RAT is capable
of remaining dormant for prearranged or commanded periods of time. The RAT only has
limited commands, which include retrieving file or disk metadata, changing the working
directory of the current C2 session, executing a command, and listing the current working
directory. The first tool, PNGDOWNER is a simple download and execute tool. The second
tool, HTTPCLIENT is a backup tool. The 3PARA RAT communicates over HTTP and
authenticates with a 256-byte hash and a hard-coded string.
Deep Panda/ APT 19/ Shell Crew/ Black Vine/ Kung Fu Kitten
According to Symantec, Crowd Strike, and other security firms Deep Panda is a Chinese
state-sponsored threat actor that began attacking the Healthcare, Aerospace, and Energy
sectors around 2012.
Deep Panda attacks tend to have massive impacts and they accrue proportional media
attention. In order to conduct multiple sizable campaigns against United States Federal
government agencies and major western health care providers for extended time periods,
Deep Panda must have considerable resources at their disposal. In illustration, it is possible
that Deep Panda was concurrently engaged in cyber-attacks against the United States Office
of Personnel Management, the Anthem healthcare network, United Airlines, and other
entities. A vast majority, ~80%, of Deep Panda targets are American.
Prior to 2012, there are indications that China did not target PII; however, Deep Panda and
affiliated groups, such as Axiom, now regularly exfiltrate PII and healthcare data. The
information is rarely, if ever, exploited for financial gain. Instead, the shift in targeted
information could indicate the likelihood that the information is valuable for the creation of
dossiers, monitoring systems, or to leverage against individuals who concern the Chinese
government.
In the United States Healthcare sector, Deep Panda has attacked VAE, Anthem, Empire Blue
Cross Blue Shield, and Carefirst. In the recent 2014-2015 Anthem breach, the group
exfiltrated ~80 million patient records. Information exfiltrated from Anthem includes
social security numbers and other personal identifiable information or personal health
information. It is believed that the Axiom group also attacked Anthem at the same time as
Deep Panda, but with a different malware and along different vectors. The attack appears

11

to be affiliated. Further, enough similarities exist between the meticulous planning and
malware employed by the two groups that many security firms hypothesize that they are
both part of the same group. There is a strong possibility that the groups are parts of a
coordinated effort under the Chinese government.
Deep Panda is believed to be responsible for the two 2015 OPM breaches. Further, Deep
Panda breached United Airlines in 2015 and stole departure and destination records. The
health, OPM, and travel records stolen by Deep Panda can be aggregated to catastrophically
impact the United States government over time. The adversary or their parent nation-state,
can use the stolen information to build a database of US employees for espionage purposes.
The information can also be used to identify United States agents in the country or to
identify Chinese assets who assist United States intelligence efforts. Moreover, the
information obtained in the OPM breach could be combined with the information stolen in
Deep Panda’s healthcare breaches or with information publically released in incidents,
such as the Ashley Madison breach, to manipulate or leverage pressure against specific
United States citizens to serve the Chinese agenda.
PLA Unit 78020/ APT 30/ Naikon
The Naikon group is allegedly a state sponsored hacking unit of the PLA, that has been
charged since 2010 with collecting intelligence from political and military targets to
advance China’s interest in the South China Sea. The threat actor is known for spearphishing campaigns against civilian, military, and government organizations in the
Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Nepal, Thailand,
and Laos. Many of these countries have strong ties to the ASEAN Union or the United States.
China desires control of the South China Sea because it relies heavily on shipping routes
through the region. The Unit 78020 campaign indicates a marriage of cyber intelligence
with physical strategic action. The connection of Naikon to the PLA is the result of security
researchers identifying one of its members as a military researcher named Ge Xing.
Spear phishing campaigns begin with a lure email relevant to the victim that carries a
malicious Microsoft Word document, which, according to Kaspersky Lab, actually contains
“a CVE-2012-0158 exploit, an executable with a double extension, or an executable with an
RTLO filename”. The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the ActiveX controls of the
MSCOMCTL.OCX Windows library. The exploit is used to install a RAT which in turn plants
a backdoor on the system.
One of Naikon’s most prolific spear phishing campaigns was the March 2014 attacks
against organizations from countries affected by the MH370 tragedy. Upon opening/
execution, the malicious payload, an 8kb encrypted file and configuration data, was injected
into the browser memory where it decrypted the ports and paths to the C2C server, a user
agent string, filenames and paths to relevant components, and hash sums of the user API
functions. The malicious code downloaded the main malware from the C2C server over an
SSL connection and then it loaded it independently of the operating system functions

12

without saving it to the hard drive by assuming control of the XS02 function and then
handling the installation in memory.
The main component of the Naikon platform is a remote administration component.
According to Trend Micro, the RARSTONE backdoor (BKDR_RARSTONE.A) can obfuscate
itself by “decrypting and loading a backdoor ‘executable file’ directly into memory without
the need to drop the actual ‘executable file.’” The backdoor installs like a Plug X backdoor,
injecting code into hidden instances of internet explorer. The module establishes a
connection to the C2C server to receive and execute any of an estimated 48 commands
from the adversary on the host. These commands include profiling the system, uploading
and downloading data, executing arbitrary code, installing other modules, or executing
commands via the command line. The backdoor routine also has the ability to get installer
properties from Uninstall Registry key entries, which allow it to silently uninstall
applications that interfere with the malware. The espionage malware collects email
messages, monitors victims keystrokes and screens in real time, and monitors network
traffic.
Axiom/ Winnti Group
The Axiom group is a Chinese, state-sponsored, threat actor that has targeted information
systems that store information relevant to China’s Thirteenth Five Year Plan since 2009.
Until 2013, the APT primarily targeted intellectual property such as source code and
internal systems design belonging to gaming companies, as well as the digital certificates
used by those companies. Targeting gaming companies, especially in the massive
multiplayer role-playing game (MMORPG) space, enables the threat actors to target
millions of users worldwide. Additionally, the theft of authentic digital certificates enables
the threat actor to sign and distribute malicious code as if it were legitimate. Afterward, it
began to attack the pharmaceutical sector and now, Axiom targets law enforcement,
governmental records and communication agencies, environmental policy agencies,
personnel management divisions, space and aerospace exploration and research entities,
and government auditing and internal affairs divisions. In the science and technology
sectors, Axiom targets networks belonging to electronics and integrated circuitry
manufacturers, networking equipment manufacturers, internet based service companies,
software vendors, cloud computing companies, energy firms, meteorological service
companies, telecommunications firms, and pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, Axiom
has targeted journalism and media outlets, Human Rights NGOs, international law firms,
international consulting and analysis firms, and high-ranking United States academic
institutions. Most of the target’s organizations have been located in the United States, South
Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the European Union, with a majority of the breaches along the
Eastern seaboard of the United States and Western Europe.
Axiom campaigns share infrastructure, malware, or attack techniques with Operation
Aurora (2009), the Elderwood Project (2009-2014), the VOHO campaign (2012), the
Shell_Crew attacks on ColdFusion servers (2013), Operation Ephemeral Hydra (2013),

13

Operation Snowman (2014), and 2014 attacks on American Middle Eastern Policy think
tanks. Axiom could be connected to some of these other groups; however, it is more likely
that Axiom advantageously adopts zero-day exploits or malware that are effective in other
campaigns.
Axiom is likely Chinese state sponsored, but there is no indication whether it is operated by
a military unit or by mercenary attackers. Axiom is more sophisticated in its operations
than the aforementioned Third Department groups. It utilizes different resources, and it
may have a different mission than Third Department groups. Novetta hypothesizes that
based on Axiom’s domestic monitoring trends it might be charged with domestic
operations and targeting Chinese dissidents in other countries. Universities and research
institutions in Hong Kong and mainland China have been targeted with Hikit malware for
persistent operations. This could indicate state-sponsored concern over liberal academics
and students.
Axiom targeting coincides with interests reflected in China’s Five-Year Plans, which push
for advanced technology and advanced R&D efforts. As China shifts away from foreign
technology, more organizations may be targeted by Axiom. The actor may target
semiconductor and networking technology firms with offices in China because China wants
to reduce its dependency on foreign technology. Western and Asian organizations may be
targeted in intelligence and counterintelligence operations. Axiom targets NGOs concerned
with international politics, environmental policy, pro-democracy movements, or human
rights movements. In some instances, Axiom will target a satellite office and move laterally
through the compromised network to the main office. Novetta theorizes that Axiom targets
NGOs as a means of the Chinese ruling party keeping track of watchdog organizations and
other groups who may publish claims that challenge the authority or “soft power” of the
party. Targeting NGOs may also enable the party to suppress dissidents or intimidate
whistleblowers.
Novetta believes that Axiom has a six stage victim lifecycle that uses a different team for
each stage of the attack. This indicates large scale organization and coordination. Initially,
the target is identified and the actor conducts reconnaissance. Then the system is
compromised, confirmed to be a valuable target, and surveyed. The actor laterally moves
through the network and creates additional footholds. Compromised C2 infrastructure is
connected to the victim network. Finally, valuable data is identified and exfiltrated.
Axiom initially compromises systems through web based attacks, targeted attacks against
public facing infrastructure, zero-day exploits, watering hole attacks, and phishing emails.
Once a system is compromised, Axiom spends a few days determining whether it is
valuable. If it is determined to contain useful information, then the group installs persistent
malware platforms. Otherwise, the group tries to move laterally through the network to
locate more valuable systems. Axiom has proven capable of compromising large pools of
machines and sifting through them in hours or days to find the valuable ones. This indicates
dedicated resources, possibly a dedicated targeting team and a deterministic set of criteria.

14

After the initial compromise, Axiom begins reconnaissance to identify where they are in the
target network and to identify any changes that have been made to the network. Axiom
then escalates privileges using previously compromised administrative accounts, local
exploits, or remote exploits as demonstrated in ZoxRPC malware. Then, over the course of
minutes or months, they try to dump the latest user credentials and exfiltrate the data.
Once inside the network, Axiom can also exploit Remote Desktop Protocol or exploit
vulnerabilities in the custom tools designed by the organization itself. This allows Axiom to
obfuscate its presence from antivirus or IDS systems.
As the campaign continues, Axiom may install additional families of malware as a
mechanism of remaining in the system even if one malware is discovered by the target.
Compromised systems have featured up to four layers of malware ranging from extremely
common (Poison Ivy, Gh0st, ZXshell) to focused tools used by threat groups (Derusbi,
Fexel) to custom Axiom malware (ZoxPNG/ZoxRPC, Hikit). Axiom routes its activity
through compromised proxy infrastructure in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, and Japan to try to disguise its traffic as legitimate to casual observation.
Novetta observes that the Hikit malware is unique to Axiom and is only used on high value
targets at the height of the victim’s operational lifecycle. Of the 43,000 compromised
systems discovered in Operation SMN, only 180 systems were infected with the Hikit
malware. Hikit is a late stage persistence and data exfiltration tool that is capable of
uploading and downloading files, generating a remote shell, tunneling into the network,
and connecting to other infected machines to generate a secondary network.
Hurricane Panda
The Hurricane Panda group targets internet services, engineering, and aerospace
companies in an attempt to steal confidential data and intellectual property.
Hurricane Panda leverages zero-day vulnerabilities, a DNS resolution exploitation
technique, and a unique toolkit to access victim networks. The group also leverages SQL
injection vulnerabilities, at least three privilege escalation exploits and a remote code
execution exploit. Once inside a network, it moves laterally onto a desired system and
establishes an RDP session. On some victim systems, the attacker installed the remote
access trojan (RAT) kit or the Chopper webshell, which provides the functionality of a RAT
on webservers. The RATs employed by Hurricane Panda have been exclusively tied to other
Chinese threat actors. Notably, the Sakula malware is closely connected to the Deep Panda
group, the Gh0st RAT has been tied to both Axiom and Hidden Lynx, the PlugX malware is
connected to the PlugX group, and the Hikit malware is used by Axiom. Additionally,
indicators of compromise linked to Aurora have been found on some networks infected by
Hurricane Panda, suggesting some level of connections between the groups.
Hurricane Panda extensively used the PlugX tool against the California based Hurricane
Electric’s free DNS service to resolve their traffic to popular domains. This led incident
responders to see the traffic as originating from sites like Pintrest, Github, Adobe, and other

15

legitimate sites. After the threat actor established a persistent presence on a victim host,
they steal legitimate credentials using tools like Windows Credential Viewer, Windows
Credential Editor, or Mimikatz. Afterward, the adversary reduces their footprint by using
the credentials to directly connect to the network and masquerade as VPN users instead of
relying on the RAT. If credentials cannot be obtained, then the group establishes an RDP
connection using a reverse RDP tunneling capability. Hurricane Panda follows the same
exfiltration methodology as most Chinese actors. Targeted files are compressed and
password protected using RAR. Then the files are moved to a convenient staging location
on the network. Finally, the files are exfiltrated via FTP.
Gothic Panda/ APT 3/ UPS/ Pirpi/ Clandestine Fox/ TG-0110
In early 2014, Gothic Panda began targeting victims in the financial sector, technology
industries, NGO/ International arena, aerospace and defense organizations,
telecommunication companies, transportation organizations, and the energy sector.
The threat actor typically relies on spear phishing emails to direct targets to a landing page
that leverages a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer. In addition to targeted
campaigns, the adversary sent out phishing emails to specialized mailing lists. Topics were
related to high-performance computing, weather metadata software, and pre-medical
programs at universities. Victims were then infected with the Pirpi malware. The adversary
has also recently used zero-day Adobe flash exploits that it obtained in the 2015 Hacking
Team breach. The Pirpi backdoor, which features strong detection evasion techniques, is
similar to the Dreammon or Dreamclick malware. The two Pirpi variants (one for 2014 and
another for 2015) connect to an C2 server and parse returned HTML for commands. The
available commands include listing TCP connection status, listing all servers on the domain,
gathering network adapter information, downloading files to memory, deleting files, listing
directories, uploading files to the C2, executing processes, and other functionalities.
NetTraveler/ Travnet/ Netfile
The NetTraveler APT was discovered in 2013 and is believed to have been active since
2004. The group primarily targets organizations in Mongolia, India, and Russia, though a
total of 350-500 infections were detected in 40 countries. Targets are involved in space
exploration, Academia, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers,
medicine, and communications. Government organizations (19%), private companies
(11%), diplomatic organizations and embassies (32%), and military organizations (9%)
were also heavily targeted. In recent years, the group has specifically targeted Tibetan and
Uyghur activists. The group focuses on cyberespionage and data theft. When Kaspersky Lab
investigated the APT, they discovered over 22 gigabytes of stolen data on NetTraveler’s C2
servers. The group is believed to consist of around 50 native Chinese members who
possess a working knowledge of the English language.
The NetTraveler APT relies on social engineering, watering hole attacks, and zero-day
exploits to compromise victim hosts. The infection vectors leveraged Java and Microsoft

16

Office exploits. After installation, the malware is designed for basic surveillance. It logs
keystrokes, cans steal sensitive documents, and it retrieves files system listings.
Mirage/APT 15/ Vixen Panda/ Ke3Chang/ GREF/ Playful Dragon
Since April 2012, the Mirage APT has targeted military and energy organizations in the
Philippines, Taiwan, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Egypt, and Nigeria. The most distinct
commonality between victims is their involvement in the contest for rights to survey
natural gas and oil in the South China Sea. It is believed that the intent of the campaign was
to exfiltrate confidential information, steal intellectual property, or to construct a botnet for
further infections.
Mirage began attacks with whale-phishing emails, targeting mid-level to senior-level
executives with nefarious emails that contain malicious droppers, disguised as PDF
attachments, that install the Mirage malware. The dropper executed and copied itself into
either C:\ Documents or C:\ Windows directory. The dropper then executed the copy of the
malware and terminated the original process. The malware establishes persistence in the
event of reboot by creating registry keys and it obfuscates its presence through the
creation of one or more files named svchost.exe, ernel32.dll, thumb.db, csrss.exe,
Reader_SL.exe, and MSN.exe. The malware profiles the system (MAC address, CPU speed,
memory size, system name, and user name) and sends the information back to the
command and control infrastructure via an HTTP request over ports 80, 443, and 8080. In
some instances, SSL was used for added security. The first variant of Mirage communicated
via an HTTP POST request and transferred information that was lightly encrypted by
adding each character’s ASCII value to its offset from the start of the payload. The second
variant of the malware communicated through HTTP GET requests and encrypted data the
same way as the former version except that the payload of the initial request is
encapsulated in a Base64-encoded string. The Mirage toolkit consisted of a backdoor and a
remote access trojan (RAT). At the time of its discovery in 2012, the command and control
structure consisted of over 100 domains. By the end of 2012, the Mirage campaign went
dormant. However, some of its infrastructure reappeared in the 2015 Hellsing campaign.
Hellsing/ Goblin Panda
The Hellsing group targets government and diplomatic organizations in the APAC
region, and nations near the South China Sea. Most targets are from Malaysia, the
Philippines, Indonesia, and India. Hellsing was discovered when Kaspersky Lab was
investigating the Naikon group and found that Hellsing had responded to a 2014 spear
phishing email from Naikon with a custom backdoor. If both Naikon and Hellsing work for
the Chinese government, this incident suggests that Hellsing is a mercenary or second tier
hacking group; though the same could be said of Naikon. It is not clear whether Naikon
intentionally targeted Hellsing or if the incident escalated. Hellsing responded to the spear
phishing request for information with a series of questions that pressed upon Naikon’s
assumed identity (as an employee of the secretariat division of the government of the
assumed target nation) and fake credentials. The dialogue and nuance of the exchange

17

indicates that the Hellsing members are more proficient in English than the Naikon group.
Finally, Hellsing emailed back a “confidential” locked RAR and the accompanying password.
The archive contained two PDFs and a malicious SCR file. The latter file was a backdoor
specifically customized to target the Naikon group. Security researchers do not know
whether Hellsing infected Naikon.
Hellsing malware samples were primarily compiled in either UTC+6 or UTC+8.
Typically, Hellsing infects targets through spear phishing emails containing password
protected RAR, ZIP, and 7ZIP archives. Locking the archives bypasses some security
features such as Gmail scans. Passwords are included in the emails to the target.
Commands to the malware allow the user to upload files, download files, update the
malware, and uninstall the malware. After Hellsing establishes a variant of its backdoor, it
deploys information-gathering tools. One tool, test.exe, gathers system information and
tests available proxies. Another tool, xkat.exe, operates from the Dbgv.sys driver to delete
files and kill processes. In addition to operations against victims, the tools may be used to
cleanse victim systems of the malware from other APT groups. Each instance of the
malware corresponds to a specific C2 server, a version number, and a campaign or victim
identifier. Some of the Hellsing infrastructure overlaps with the Mirage APT.
Stone Panda
Crowdstrike identifies Stone Panda as a Chinese APT that has targeted healthcare,
aerospace, defense, and government organizations since May 2010. Stone Panda specializes
in cyberespionage, network reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and lateral network
exploration.
Stone Panda uses spear-phishing to install the PoisonIvy RAT and IEChecker/ EvilGrab tool
kit on victim machines. Poison Ivy is a remote administrative tool that is created and
controlled by a management kit featuring a graphical user interface. The exploit kit is
widely available for purchase or download on the dark net; consequently, its use in highlevel campaigns could indicate a lack of technical sophistication of the adversary, who
otherwise could have created a custom backdoor utility. Conversely, use of a publically
available tool could be an opportunistic or strategic choice as the decision reduces costs to
the campaign and complicates profiling attempts due to the ubiquity of the tool. The tool is
also used by Axiom and Nightshade Panda.
The PoisonIvy backdoor is copied into the Windows/system32 folder and the filename and
installation location are defined by the attacker. Some variants of the malware are capable
of copying themselves into an Alternate Data Stream. A registry entry is created to ensure
that the malware runs at startup. The malware connects to a server through encrypted and
compressed communication and the malware can be configured to inject itself into a
browser process before establishing an outgoing connection in order to bypass some
firewalls. PoisonIvy gives the attacker complete control over the victim system. The most
common operations include: renaming, deleting, uploading, downloading or executing files;
viewing or editing registry keys; viewing, suspending, or killing running processes; viewing

18

or terminating network connections; viewing and controlling services; viewing or disabling
installed devices; enumerating, deleting, or uninstalling programs. PoisonIvy can steal
information by taking screenshots, recording audio or webcam footage, and by capturing
saved passwords and hashes. Some variants feature a keylogger and addition functionality
provided by third-party plugins.
The EvilGrab exploit kit is spyware that is capable of capturing audio, video, screenshots,
and log keystrokes from infected Windows machines. It has three primary components:
one .EXE and two .DLL files. The executable acts as the installer. One of the digital libraries
is the loader for the other, which is the main backdoor component. Some variants delete
the executable after installation. Some variants, such as the IEChecker used by Stone Panda,
are capable of stealing credentials stored in Internet Explorer and Outlook. Additionally,
some versions are designed to steal information from Tencent QQ, a Chinese instant
messaging application or to inject itself into certain security products, such as those
distributed by ESET, Kaspersky, and McAfee.
Nightshade Panda
Since February 2008, Nightshade Panda has targeted systems belonging to media
corporations, NGOs and international relation organizations, and universities. It shares
many similarities to its sister campaign, Stone Panda. Nightshade Panda also specializes in
network reconnaissance, lateral network exploration, data exfiltration, and
cyberespionage.
Nightshade likely delivers malware through targeted spear-phishing emails. Nightshade
Panda relies on the PoisonIvy malware, also used by Stone Panda and Axiom, and on the
PlugX malware, used by Naikon. The PlugX malware performs many of the same functions
as the PoisonIvy malware, though its more recent development, beginning in 2012 instead
of 2008 for the former, may make it preferable for attackers. The malware consists of three
components: a legitimate file, a malicious .DLL that is loaded by the legitimate file, and a
binary file that contains the malicious code loaded by the .DLL.
PlugX also has features that distinguish it from PoisonIvy. It can also be loaded with several
backdoor and other unique modules. XPlugDisk allows the malware to copy, move, rename,
execute and delete files. XPlugKeyLogger allows the malware to log keystrokes made on
current active windows. XPlugRegedit allows the malware to enumerate, create, delete and
modify registry entries and values. XPlugProcess allows the attacker to enumerates
processes, collect process information, and terminates processes. XPlugNethood allows the
malware to enumerate network resources and set TCP connection states. XPlugService
allows the malware to delete, enumerate, modify and start services. XPlugShell allows the
malware to perform remote shell on the affected system. The malware also has a debug log
file that allows attackers to monitor its performance and troubleshoot issues and errors.

19

Anchor Panda
Crowdstrike revealed the presence of Anchor Panda at the 2013 RSA conference.
Supposedly the APT had launched 124 attacks in the first half of 2013. Most of the attacks
were aimed at civilian and military maritime operations in the green/brown water regions
in the area of operations of the South Sea Fleet of the PLA Navy. The group also targeted
companies in the United States, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Australia, and other nations
involved in maritime satellite systems, aerospace industries, and the defense sector.
Embassies, diplomatic organizations, foreign intelligence services, and foreign government
space programs may also have been targeted. The target of organizations in the South
China Sea and in the aerospace sector distinctly align with China’s Twelfth Five-Year Plan,
which was in place at the time of the attacks. It is believed that the focus of the group is
cyberespionage and the theft of confidential data and intellectual property.
Anchor Panda uses the Gh0st exploit kit, which is also employed by Axiom and Hidden
Lynx; the PoisonIvy malware, which is used by Axiom, Stone Panda, and Nightshade Panda;
the Torn RAT; or a custom backdoor detected by Symantec as the Anchor Panda Backdoor.
Numbered Panda/ APT 12/ IXESHE/ DYNCALC/ JOY RAT/ Etumbot
Numbered Panda targets are consistent with PRC strategic goals. In the past, it has target
media outlets, high-tech companies, and government organizations. The focus of the
campaign appears to be cyberespionage. It has also strategically targeted organizations
involved in time-sensitive operations, such as the cleanup and containment of the
Fukushima Reactor in 2011.
Numbered Panda delivers its malware through spear-phishing emails that contain binary
executables concealed as screen saver files and PDF attachments. Numbered Panda
bypasses egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized communications by
dynamically calculating the C2 port by resolving a DNS. The malware uses two DNS names
for communication. One name is used for command and control, while the other is used to
algorithmically calculate which port it should use. One variant of the algorithm used to
calculate the C2 port is to multiply the first two octets of the IP address and add the third
octet to that value. This is typically represented as: (A * B) + C. For example, common
values might be 200.2.43.X, which would result in communication on port 443. The group
often uses blog and WordPress sites in its C2 infrastructure to make traffic seem legitimate.
Though its tools, tactics, and techniques evolve, especially after public exposure, Numbered
Panda has been known to use the Etumbot exploit kit. The group has used the Etumbot,
RIPTIDE, HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT backdoors. Backdoors were dropped
from malicious documents that exploited CVE-2012-0158 and relied on the “Tran Duy
Linh” exploit kit. RIPTIDE was used from October 2012 to May 2014. The backdoor
communicates via HTTP to a hardcoded C2 server, and it is proxy-aware. Its first
communication fetches an encryption RC4 key that is used to encrypt further
communications.

20

HIGHTIDE is a similar backdoor that appeared in a malicious Microsoft Word document in
an August 2014 email sent from a compromised account in a Taiwanese government
ministry to another official. The malware changes the user agent and the format and
structure of the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) from the RIPTIDE variant.
The THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT malwares also surfaced in August 2014 in a malicious
Word document attached to a spear-phishing email to a technology company in Taiwan.
The backdoors appear to be variants of HIGHTIDE.
Hidden Lynx / Aurora
Hidden Lynx is a 50-100 member Chinese professional “hackers for hire” group that has
conducted hundreds of attacks against government organizations, the financial sector, and
the education sector since 2009.Within the financial sector, investment banks and asset
management agencies are the primary targets. The group has also targeted stock trading
firms and conducted indirect attacks on organizations that supply hardware, secure
network communications, and specific services to the financial sector. Overall, the targets
share the characteristics of possessing valuable information such as confidential financial
data, specific knowledge of potential mergers or acquisitions, or other information that
could give the client of the attacker a competitive advantage in the sector or specific
knowledge of ongoing negotiations or business deals. Microsoft claims that during
Operation Aurora Hidden Lynx targeted databases containing court order emails. Over half
of Hidden Lynx attacks target United States organizations, while another quarter of the
attacks target organizations in Taiwan or China. The broad range of targets and specificity
of the information targeted suggests the mercenary nature of the attacker. The information
stolen is not used for direct financial gain, so it is possible that Hidden Lynx steals
information on behalf of a third party.
Most attacks begin as a watering hole attack or a spear phishing email; however, Hidden
Lynx has also been known to attack public facing infrastructure or hack the supply chain in
order to distribute their malware. The majority of Hidden Lynx attacks originate from C2
infrastructure located in China. Victim systems are infected with two Trojans, a mass
exploitation Trojan (Trojan Moudoor) and a targeted Trojan (Trojan Naid). Each Trojan
may be managed by a different division of the team. Trojan Moudoor deploys the Moudoor
backdoor, which is a modified version of the “Gh0st RAT” malware. The remote access
Trojan is used to control machines in significant campaigns against multiple large
companies across several sectors. The Moudoor team must be sizable because the attack
vector requires attackers to breach individual targets and to extract valuable and specific
data from compromised networks. Trojan Naid is used in limited attacks against valuable
targets. Given its restricted use and the sophistication of its application, the team behind it
is likely a specialized subgroup operations team within the adversarial organization.
Hidden Lynx has also used the Gresim backdoor, the Fexel backdoor, the Hikit backdoor,
and the Derusbi malware in their exploit kit.

21

Hidden Lynx adversary regularly exploits zero-day vulnerabilities, which are purchased,
discovered, or reworked from other groups’ attacks. Ultimately, the adversary is
methodical and it tailors its exploit kit in each attack to its victim. Hidden Lynx adapts and
it develops custom tools or new techniques as necessary.

Overt Spy Structure
The overt espionage directives of the CCP pass from the party through the Politburo
Standing Committee (PSC) to the State Council. The PSC consists of five to nine (currently
seven) members who lead the CCP. It decides on major issues and policies when the
Politburo is not in session. Effectively, the PSC is the strongest decision making body in
China and its rulings de facto have the force of law. The State Council, consisting of
(currently) 35 members, including, the Premier and heads of each governmental
department, is the chief authority of the PRC. Depending on the situation, the PSC or State
Council pass instructions to either the United Front Work Department, which exerts
influence over Chinese nationals, or the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, which exerts
control over Chinese nationals. The United Front Department or Overseas Chinese Affairs
Office further relays instructions to various communities within their respective domains.
United Front Department
The United Front Department (UFD) manages relations with non-Communist Party elite
inside and outside of China to ensure that they abide by the laws set by the Communist
Party. The UFD expands the sphere of influence of the Communist Party by creating strong
ties with tongs and hometown associations in foreign nations, along with community
leaders and, in some cases, triads and street gangs. Bonds are often formed through the
exchange of position, informal trade agreements, or other incentives for influence.
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office
The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council is the division of the PRC tasked
with liaising with external Chinese communities and returning nationals. Essentially, the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office manages the circles of influence formed by the United Front
Department.
Consulates and Embassies
Communications between the United Front Department or Overseas Chinese Affairs Office
and external communities is facilitated by Chinese Consulates and Embassies.
Tongs and Hometown Associations
A surprising number of influential Chinese community members as well as the leaders of
Tongs and homeowner associations act as local representatives of the CCP. These members
pass directions, recruit members, and collect information within their area, of relevance to
the CCP. Tongs and homeowner associations can be leveraged to exert pressure or pass on

22

threats to members of the local Chinese communities to turn individuals into insider
threats in their workplace or research institution.
Triads and Street Gangs
At the lowest level, triads and street gangs act as informants, muscle, and smugglers for the
CCP and its operatives. The CCP has used triads and street gangs to disrupt protests, agitate
dissidents, or disrupt the moral fabric of target regions by importing synthetic drugs and
weapons.
Chinese Student and Scholars Associations
American universities accept a significant number of international students for a vast
multitude of reasons. Some universities globally attract the most promising students,
regardless of nationality. Other schools seek to diversify their student base in order to offer
a balanced and realistic worldview. Realistically, many American universities target
international audiences in anticipation of higher profits. For instance, in the 2013-2014
academic year, over sixty percent of Chinese students enrolled at American universities (or
organizations sponsoring Chinese students) paid the full tuition cost of enrollment. This
contributed an estimated $22 billion to the U.S. economy in 2014. Some schools even
captured additional profit by charging international students additional fees. The overall
margin of profit can be significant when compared to the often-subsidized tuition rate
offered to domestic students. The excess profits allow universities, especially private
institutions that do not receive government funding, to afford their programs and to offer
additional scholarships to domestic students. In some cases, these short-term profits may
have long-term repercussions. Among other issues discussed later in this section,
International students are less likely to remain in the area around the university to benefit
the community or nation, and they are less likely to donate back to the institution after
graduation. Additionally, Chinese professionals trained in the United States, are returning
to China with their accumulated knowledge and using it to improve China’s infrastructure,
economy, and education system.
According to the Institute of International Education’s Project Atlas, approximately
974,926 international students were enrolled in American Universities in the 2014-2015
academic year. Approximately 31.2% of the international student population (~304,040)
originated from China. This is a fivefold increase over the 62,523 Chinese students enrolled
in American universities in 2004-2005. In fact, 2015 was the sixth year in a row that China
was the leading place of origin for international students in the United States. U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Evan Ryan attributes the trend to a
growing middle class in China, the excellence of the American higher education system, and
China’s desire to be competitive in the 21st Century.
The mutually symbiotic relationship between American Universities and Chinese students
is not without problems. At even a basic level, the demand for overseas education caused a
“cottage industry of businesses” in China that assist in the preparation of students’

23

applications. The poorly regulated industry is a hotbed for academic fraud and corruption.
According to one educational consulting company, almost 90% of applicants submitted
fake recommendations, 70% had others write their English entry essays, 50% forged high
school transcripts, and 10% listed academic awards and achievements that they did not
receive.
Currently, the number of resident Chinese undergraduate and graduate student
populations are roughly equal. This indicates that in recent years, Chinese students have
begun to enroll in American institutions directly after finishing high school, instead of
obtaining an undergraduate degree from a domestic institution first. These students
typically attended an international high school in China to improve their English and to
prepare for American tests, such as the SAT, rather than preparing for domestic
examinations. Due to culture differences and language barriers, Chinese students do not
always integrate well into U.S. campus and social life. College administrators and students
recognized a tendency for Chinese students, more than other international populations, to
socialize primarily within their cultural community rather than engaging with the broader
academic community. Consequently, Chinese Student and Scholar Associations (CSSAs) are
increasingly active at over 150 universities in the United States.
Officially, CSSAs help native Chinese students balance their life, work, studies, and other
issues while they are enrolled in foreign institutions such as overseas universities. CSSAs
were created to bridge the cultural gap between Chinese and foreign cultures at these
institutions. CSSAs may also be a pivotal overt espionage platform for the Chinese
government.
The vast majority of CSSAs receive funding from the Chinese government or have an active
liaison via the consulate back to the CCP. CSSA may be used to persuade students to act as
temporary or prolonged intelligence assets. It is speculated that for one of these reasons,
Columbia University disbanded its CSSA in March 2015 after “ongoing violations of
multiple financial and student organizational policies.” Through CSSAs, students can be
manipulated into passing intellectual property or research back to their home state or
planting malware on a university system. How many students, conditioned from birth not
to question their government, would resist the order to plug a malicious USB into a
research network if their liaison threatened to revoke their funding or permission to study
abroad? University networks are intentionally open and research machines are not
configured with security as a priority. Compromise of a research network can enable
Chinese APTs, such as Unit 61398, to leapfrog onto affiliated military or government
networks.
Of the global international student population surveyed by the Institute of International
Education in 2014, over 65% were pursuing degrees in Business and Management,
Engineering, Natural Sciences, or Mathematics and Computer Sciences. Assuming that the
percentage holds true for the Chinese population, then in 2015, over 195,000 Chinese

24

students may have had access to research materials that directly aligned with China’s FiveYear Plan.
According to a 2011 FBI report, universities are the ideal place to “to find recruits, propose
and nurture ideas, learn and even steal research data, or place trainees,” because young
students’ minds are open to suggestion and young adults are still learning how to handle
responsibility, operate independently, and solve problems. While American intelligence
organizations recruit using money, ideology, coercion or ego (MICE), Chinese intelligence
recruit using promises of fame, feelings of lust or anger, and short term profits (FLAP). In
one instance described in the report, a naïve researcher was invited to submit a paper to an
international conference, after which the host requested a copy, and passed her a thumb
drive. The drive downloaded every file on her laptop. In another instance, a researcher
arranged for researchers in their home country to visit and allowed them to photograph lab
equipment so that it could be reconstructed in their own lab. The utility of students as
intelligence assets, while not flawless, should not be dismissed.
While students may not seem the best intelligence assets, China has the advantage of sheer
numbers. Though the approach may seem sloppy or unprofessional, relying on human
resources to obfuscate malicious activity has the advantage of overwhelming American
intelligence agencies’ attempts to track suspicious activities. The downside of this
intelligence collection by numbers model is that assets are unreliable or untrained so
agents may send multiple students after the same information and may receive the same
document multiple times as a result. This increases operational risk and noise. America is
not alone in this threat. In April 2014, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed the presence of
a Chinese spy network in Australian education institutions and reported that Australian
law enforcement agencies could not properly monitor the number of potential Chinese
spies.
China collects intelligence through an application of the mosaic theory; the idea that
thousands or millions of small pieces of information come together into a larger picture.
The “human machine” that generates the mosaic does not even have to be entirely
organized or controlled by the Chinese government. China has developed its culture and
economy such that there are strong incentives for spying. Operationally, the model treats
students as grains of sand. Key individuals within the multitude complete small, often
seemingly insignificant tasks at the behest of an intelligence official. Why have a single spy
steal 1000 documents when 1000 spies could each steal a single document? In the words of
former FBI official David Major, “If it wanted to steal a beach, Russia would send a forklift.
China would send a thousand people who would pick up a grain of sand at a time.” In many
cases, the student may never realize the harm or their utility to their government.
Holistically, only a fraction of the populace are ever active assets, yet their collective
actions culminate in significant gains in intelligence and intellectual property.
Unlike traditional intelligence organizations, China does not train its potential agents in any
form of tradecraft. Instead, their strategy is to have the pawn lie if they are caught. The

25

theory behind this approach is that each student’s actions are of minimal risk to the
Chinese government. A minority of those chosen to gather intelligence abroad may be
groomed to fulfill their roles prior to leaving the country. This process ranges from
reminders to remain loyal to China to regular reports of useful information to an active
aggressive insider threat. Those groomed and the unwitting assets can be further
compelled to pass more information to their handlers through threats, guilt, or a sense of
national pride. In addition to collecting information, student spies may be used by CSSAs to
welcome visiting leaders at airports or to block protest groups from sight.
Chinese students may also be used to coerce or recruit domestic students. University
students rarely consider national security when they share notes and research materials. In
April 2015, the FBI warned U.S. students travelling abroad to guard themselves against
attempts to influence their behavior or recruit them as spies. Chinese intelligence agents
target students who study abroad because they are prime candidates for positions in
governments and large companies. These “seeding operations” attempt to grow study
abroad students into potent insider threats. In a podcast, Mollie Halpern, at the FBI Office of
Public Affairs, noted: “To foster the relationship, foreign intelligence operatives will flatter
and encourage students, show interest in their future success, and even promise to help
them obtain a government-issued visa or work permit—but it’s all disingenuous and empty
promises. The truth is, the operatives are just using the student as a pawn to achieve their
own ends, without concern for the student’s welfare or future.”
This warning was accompanied by a video featuring the story of Glenn Duffie Shriver.
Shriver was an American student who answered a $120 ad in 2004 to write a paper on U.S.China relations. Through a series of connections, Shriver was financially coerced into
spying on the United States for China. Over the next few years, the Chinese intelligence
agents paid Shriver over $70,000 to attempt to pass examinations to enter the United
States Foreign Service and the CIA. In June 2010, Shriver was arrested and charged with
“making false statements”, for failing to reveal his associations during his application to the
CIA, and for “willingly conspiring to provide national defense information to intelligence
officers of the PRC.” In October 2010, as part of a plea bargain, Shriver pled guilty to one
count of conspiracy to commit unlawful conveyance of national defense information. In
January 2011, he was sentenced to four years in prison, though he was released in late
2013. According to the department of Justice, between March 2008 and October 2010, 45
individuals were convicted in 26 cases involving espionage on behalf of China, though
Shriver was the only student among them.
In May 2016, growing concerns over the threat of espionage in critical research
environments resulted in the State Department proposing a rule that would bar foreign
students from certain research projects and classes involving information seen as vital to
national security. Of particular concern was research related to defense technologies,
energy engineering, and aerospace applications. The Association of American Universities,
representing 62 leading research institutions including Harvard, Duke University, and the
University of Chicago, as well as Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

26

(MIT) and the University of Pennsylvania have criticized the rule, citing “disastrous
consequences.”
Academic Solicitation
As was the case with Glenn Duffie Shriver, some foreign powers attempt to solicit
academics through seemingly innocuous proposals or offers of collaboration. In some
cases, such as with Shriver, these are active attempts to start a dialogue and build a
relationship that will increase the leverage over a target asset until they are malleable. In
other instances, academic solicitation is a covert attempt to obtain classified or proprietary
information through requests to review academic papers or host lectures. The innovation
or insight contained in an un-vetted presentation or publication can be critical to military
and strategic operations. For example, in 1998, Chen Dingchang, a head of a Chinese
military-sponsored research group on anti-satellite technology, viewed a presentation at
the University of Florida about diamond-coating manufacturing. The technology could also
be used in missile seekers and other systems. In 1999, Chen and other authors published a
report in a Chinese journal that credited the Florida presentation in assisting them in
overcoming a technical bottleneck in China’s development of anti-satellite warheads.
According to a 2011 U.S. Defense Department report, “Placing academics at U.S. research
institutions under the guise of legitimate research offers access to developing U.S.
technologies and cutting-edge research” in such areas as information systems, lasers,
aeronautics and underwater robots. The report further stated that these attempts
increased eightfold between 2009 to 2010. In other cases, professors may receive a request
to collaborate, but they may not be fully aware of the allegiances of the requester.
Academia is an open, collaborative field that is built upon the nurturing of ideas amongst
distant and far-flung individuals at universities around the globe. Researchers, especially in
niche fields, may not suspect an interested party of malice; instead, they may revel in the
sudden interest in their work. For example, several years ago, Professor Daniel J. Scheeres,
a frequent host of visiting scholars, received a request from Yu Xiaohong to study with him
at the University of Michigan. Xiaohong cited an affiliation to the civilian Chinese Academy
of Sciences and she expressed “general interest” in Scheeres research into the movement of
celestial bodies. When Yu arrived, her questions made Scheeres uncomfortable. Specifically,
he was disconcerted by her interest in military satellite-orbit applications of the field. He
did not deeply engage with Xiaohong and he later stopped accepting visiting scholars from
China altogether as a result of the experience. He was unaware at the time that Xiaohong
listed her address as the same as the Academy of Equipment Command and Technology,
where Chinese military cadets and officers are trained, or that she had previously coauthored an article on improving the precision of anti-satellite weapons. Yu Xiaohong later
wrote a paper about the implications for space warfare of the NASA Deep Impact mission,
which sent a spacecraft to collide with a comet.

Front Companies
As of 2010, China had over 3200 front companies in the United States whose sole purpose
was to acquire American technology. That number has likely increased significantly within
recent years. In 2011, U.S. and Canadian universities earned $2.5 billion from licensing
technology. Given that universities do not tend to investigate companies before licensing
software and inventions, some of the licenses may have been issued to front companies for
China and other foreign powers. Efforts to detect front companies have improved through
the collaboration of some academic institutions with the FBI and other law enforcement;
however, many universities resist such a connection out of fear that it will hamper research
and intellectual freedoms or establish an undesired precedent.
Insider Threats
Chinese researchers trained at American universities can be leveraged by CSSAs, tongs, or
even triads, to act as insider threats at the employment that they obtain through the
University’s network. For example, Hanjuan Jin joined Motorola Solutions Inc. as a software
engineer shortly after earning a master’s degree from University of Notre Dame in South
Bend, Indiana. While at Motorola, she received a second master’s degree in computer
science from the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Despite the opportunities
offered by a bountiful education, in February 2014, Hanjuan Jin, was found guilty of
stealing trade secrets, although she was acquitted of charges that she did so to benefit
China’s military. Hanjaun Jin allowed the CCP to influence her life years after graduation,
despite living comfortably in the United States.
Some Chinese nationals were groomed to be international insider threats at foreign
organizations. Others are threatened, bribed, or otherwise coerced into passing
information or compromising systems on behalf of the CCP. The insider’s contribution
could be as little as clicking on a spear phishing email, plugging in a USB, or distracting an
employee from their system.
Monitored Communities
The Chinese university network of students or placed government officials are not limited
to the theft of intellectual property and research. They also monitor those critical of the
Chinese regime. Students, professors, and others critical of the Chinese Communist Party
have reported interrogations, and in some cases threats, when visiting China in response to
comments that they made thousands of miles away from Chinese shores. Tongs, triads, and
gangs can also be used in a similar capacity in Chinese communities. One Australian
lecturer was interrogated four times in response to his criticisms. Joshua Philipp of Epoch
Times reported, “Chen Yonglin, a former Chinese diplomat at the Chinese Consulate in
Sydney, told Epoch Times when he defected in 2005 there were more than 1,000 Chinese
secret agents operating in Australia, alone.” Similarly, in an article for Business Insider, Jack
Murphy recounts his awkward experience of naively asking a study group of himself and
three Chinese students at Columbia University about the practice of Falun Gong. He recalls
the palpable silence and fear imposed by what he thought was an innocent question and his

28

experience discovering that he had unwittingly pitted his groupmates in a prisoner’s
dilemma if they answered him. Jack learned that much as CSSAs, Tongs, and Triads can be
leveraged to monitor Chinese nationals, so could communities of Chinese students be used
to monitor each other for signs of subversion of the PRC. Within its borders, the CCP uses
the Great Firewall and signal intelligence to control and monitor the online activities of its
people. Outside of its territory, the CCP relies on overt spy organizations to monitor
potential dissidents and there are actually allegations that the one of the departments
collects covert and overt intelligence for the sole purpose of informing an application that
monitors the opinions and activities of every Chinese citizen, domestic and abroad. This
constant state of observation has induced a chilling effect in Chinese citizens, which
prevents many from consciously subverting the CCP.
One sophisticated monitoring system, referred to as the Social Credit System (SCS) will go
into full effect by 2020. The SCS will make Orwell’s Big Brother seem distant by
comparison. The SCS attributes a rating to each citizen based on constant appraisals of
their physical and virtual activities, their dialogues, their patriotism, their purchase habits,
their friends’ opinions of them, and numerous other characteristics. If ever a citizen acts
outside predetermined parameters, then their score lowers in the system. Those with high
scores receive tangible benefits, such as travel visas, access to business loans, and other
incentives while those with low scores receive punishment from the government as well as
active disincentives. Much like Orwell’s dystopia, the system rewards those who report
“breaches of trust.” One example of a disincentive is that those who score low may become
social pariahs because the SCS actively punishes those with a higher score from associating
with those below them. Currently, methods of developing SCS scores are being tested at
eight companies under state-approved pilot programs. One such pilot focuses on 400
million users of the Alibaba network to develop scores based on financial information and
purchasing habits. While the algorithm is fine-tuned, China is implementing the
infrastructure to make the Social Credit System feasible within the mainland. Moreover,
external communities may not be exempt from monitoring.
In September 2015, Joshua Philipp of Epoch Times reported that Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi,
and other devices manufactured in China had preinstalled spyware that allowed Chinese
companies to track users, listen to calls, and make online purchases. Worse yet, many of the
products manufactured in China already feature language in the terms and conditions
authorizing the Chinese government to monitor the data that passes through the devices
(even those located in the United States) for indicators of subversion against the CCP. By
using the devices, the users unwittingly agree to abide by the laws and authority of the
Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, many companies that operate in China are already
subject to rigid compliance regulations, such as the inclusion of a CCP liaison and in some
cases, backdoors into hardware and software. Currently, every company operating within
Chinese borders with more than 50 employees are required to have at least one liaison to
the Communist Party on site. For example, Joshua Philip of Epoch Times explains, “At
Mitsubishi Electric (Guangzhou) Compressor Co., Ltd., the number of CPC members exceeds

29

100, and nearly half of the managers above the team leader level are CPC members at the
Japanese company." He adds, "Chen Kailong with the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee said foreign companies are increasingly supportive of establishing Party
branches because they help with the enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations and
mediation in labor disputes.” These liaisons can internally influence the organization or act
as insider threats.
China’s new cybersecurity law proposes even greater censorship and control over
companies. Under the guise of added security for its people, the CCP may require any
company that operates in China to allow the Chinese government unrestricted access to
their systems and control over their internet access. In effect, the CCP could install
backdoors and spyware in every device that passes through China. Even if foreign citizens
somehow manage to avoid purchasing devices manufactured in China, their lives may be
monitored through numerous public IoT devices of which China is the sole manufacturer.
This global espionage platform can be combined with the dossiers and databases
constructed from the information exfiltrated in the incessant cyberattacks conducted by
Chinese APTs, to gain unparalleled advantage over the global population.
Conclusion
ICIT research rarely fills pages with artistically designed info graphics, charts or graphs.
Instead we compose our reports with raw, interlinking linguistic tiles with a 12-point font
and single spaces. Our research is meant to shed light and inform rather than impress and
offer silver bullet solutions. For the past year, this particular report has been heavily
requested by federal agencies, members of Congress, journalists and private sector
organizations that have been profoundly affected by Chinese intellectual property theft.
With such a high stakes topic about a state adversary that has had such a devastating
impact on industry, economy and National security, we found it necessary to pay less
attention to softball language and zero in on the facts and realities of this particularly
devious antagonist.
This report was not about China’s grotesque human rights violations, their poor
manufacturing quality, fifty cent trolling army propaganda or continuous feuds between
their military and government. And this report was not about the latest conversations of
byte for byte retaliation by industry against Chinese actors with weaponized data and
cyber-attack. This report is about the layers of espionage and theft and those malicious
actors who carry out these overt and covert attacks on Western industry. Uncovering the
layers and pinpointing the contributors and liberating this document into public discussion
are the first steps in understanding a complicated adversary with the intent on combatting
its initiatives.
Combatting the complicated layers of China’s multipronged attack means erecting
profound layers of cyber and physical security composed of bleeding edge technology and
the latest in counter intelligence expertise. True multinational threat sharing between

30

industry and law enforcement compounded by a judicial system that combats insider
threats and IP theft with harsh penalties will pave the way for the legislative community to
bring forth a new standard in international cooperation to combat the Chinese menace.
