August 18, 2022

On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that
have been gaining traction within the OSINT community and within our datasets. The
Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving
ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants.
This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the DarkyLock, Gwisin, vvyu, Kriptor,
and Cuba ransomware families.
Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users
Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption
Severity level: High

DarkyLock ransomware
1/5

DarkyLock is a Babuk variant that appears to be new for 2022. Should this variant execute
on a victim’s system, files will be encrypted and changed to have a “.darky” file extension.
Figure 1. Files encrypted by DarkyLock ransomware.
Locations where files are encrypted will also have a ransom note deposited in them named
“Restore-My-Files.txt”.
Figure 2. DarkyLock ransom note.
The ransom note demands 0.005BTC (approximately $120.00USD) to decrypt the files on an
affected system. At the time of writing, there have been no transactions observed using the
Bitcoin wallet mentioned in the ransom note.
An interesting string appears in the DarkyLock executable that references LockBit 3.0, also
known as Lockbit Black ransomware.

It’s currently unknown why the reference to LockBit 3.0 is includes “colorful” language.

Gwisin ransomware
Gwisin is ransomware variant that was reportedly used to target companies in South Korea.
It encrypts files on compromised machines and adds a file extension named after the target
company to the affected files.
In order to become infected, an MSI (Windows installer) file is delivered to the target
machine. Contained within that is a Windows DLL file that requires a specific set of criteria to
be met via the installer package to execute, making it difficult to detect in an environment. It
is likely that the circumstances for installation are unique to each victim organization.

vvyu ransomware
vvyu is a variant of the STOP/DJVU ransomware family designed to encrypt files on a
victim’s machine. Should the ransomware be successful in running, a ransom note will be
deposited in every location where files are encrypted.
Figure 5. vvyu ransom note
It demands a price of $980USD to have software provided to decrypt the affected files on the
system, although a discount is promised for payment within the first 72 hours. Support e-mail
addresses and a unique ID are also provided for contact with the operators. Files encrypted
by vvyu will have a “.vvyu” file extension appended to them.

Kriptor ransomware
At first glance, the ransom note and screen from Kriptor appear very similar to those of the
infamous WannaCry ransom attack from 2017. There’s even a reference to it,
“Wannacry@Kozisis,” in a WannaCry-like ransom screen. Unlike Wannacry, however, there
is no mechanism for self-propagation to spread to other machines.
As with Wannacry and other ransomware families, Kriptor will encrypt files of interest on a
victim machine and demand a ransom of $300USD worth of Bitcoin (0.012BTC) to be sent to
a wallet controlled by the malware authors. At the time of this writing, there have been no
transactions observed using the Bitcoin wallet mentioned in the ransom note.
Figure 7. Kriptor ransom note.
Files will be encrypted and appended with a “.Kriptor” file extension. A running clock will
count down from 72 hours, after which point the malware authors threaten to double the
ransom and/or prevent decryption permanently from that point onwards.

Cuba ransomware
The Cuba ransomware family has been observed since 2019. They use the now ubiquitous
“double extortion” method of threatening to release a victim’s data on the Internet if they do
not pay the requested ransom.
Figure 10. Cuba ransomware TOR site.
Once the ransomware has executed, a ransom note will be deposited in any directory where
files have been encrypted. The ransom note will be named “!! READ ME !!.txt” and contain a
unique ID to contact the ransomware controllers to pay. The primary contact channel is Tox
(a peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol) with a backup e-mail address if a victim cannot
make contact. Files encrypted by Cuba will have a “.cuba” file extension appended.

Best practices include not paying a ransom

4/5

Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against
paying a ransom, partly because payment does not guarantee files will be recovered.
Ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,
encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that
could potentially be illegal, according to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC) advisory. The FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page, where victims
can submit samples of ransomware activity via the Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).
