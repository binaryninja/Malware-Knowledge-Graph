The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead
to China
Posted February 27, 2015 by ThreatConnect Intelligence Research
Team (TCIRT)[1] �led under Threat Research[2].
UPDATE: Premera Latest Healthcare Insurance Agency to be
Breached[3]
When news of the Anthem breach was reported on February 4th,
2015, the security industry quite understandably went wild. A
breach of this magnitude was certainly unprecedented. Naturally,
many industry professionals were keenly interested in digging
into this incident to see what could be uncovered, and the
research team at ThreatConnect was no exception. Thanks to our
powerful API[4] and third-party partner[5] integrations, we were
able to use ThreatConnect to quickly uncover a wealth of
intelligence even when initially hindered by a relative lack of
investigative lead information and context, a key requirement of
any Threat Intelligence Platform[6] (TIP). However, before we
delve into what we were able to uncover, let’s brie�y review the
facts as they stood in the wake of the initial discovery
announcement.

What We Know:
On the morning of February 4th, 2015, several major news outlets
broke the story[7] that Anthem, Inc.’s network defenses had been
breached. According to a statement from Anthem’s CEO[8], the
company fell victim to a “very sophisticated external cyber
attack,” and the hackers “obtained” the personally identi�able
information (PII) of approximately 80M customers. This included
social security numbers, birthdays, street addresses, phone
numbers and income data – plenty of information to enable
identity theft. This was a signi�cant event for several reasons:
Anthem, formerly known as Wellpoint, is the largest managed
healthcare company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association,
and by extension, one of the largest healthcare organizations
in the United States. As such, any compromise, no matter how
insigni�cant, would likely impact countless individuals.
Blue Cross Blue Shield provides healthcare coverage for about
half the U.S. federal workforce. This means that their
information was potentially compromised too.
Unlike the Sony hack which was destructive in nature and
meant to send a message for coercive purposes, the Anthem
compromise was purportedly very covert, a fact which may
suggest something about the adversary’s motives.
As of late February 2015, there have not been any indications
that the ex�ltrated PII data was immediately commoditized on
the black market for the purpose of enabling identity theft, as
was the case in the Home Depot Breach.

Filling the Gaps:
Obviously, these high-level observations do not provide
cybersecurity researchers a great deal of information to work with.
However, when presented within the context of a Threat
Intelligence Platform (TIP), an incomplete trail of evidence can
highlight intelligence gaps, a study of which can orient threat
researchers towards their analytic objectives. To this end, let’s
examine what we wanted to discover in the context of the Anthem
breach:
Who was responsible for the attack?
What was the objective of the attack? Was it cyber theft, an
espionage operation, or something different?
Who was targeted in the attack? The answer to this question,
obscured as it may be, would likely shed some light on the
objective of the breach.
What was the timeline of the activity?
The real power of a Threat Intelligence Platform is demonstrated
when you are able to collect and maintain a robust dataset of
threat indicators, both past and present, which can help orient
you in the right direction in the wake of a newly discovered
breach. Even when you do not have a good deal of information to
start with (for example a �le hash, or an IP address), you may �nd
leads by pivoting through archived datasets until you uncover key
pieces of the puzzle. In the case of the Anthem breach, we were
able to do just that.

Anthem Themed Infrastructure & Signed
Malware:
In September 2014, the ThreatConnect Intelligence Research
Team (TCIRT)[9] observed a variant of the Derusbi APT malware
family, MD5: 0A9545F9FC7A6D8596CF07A59F400FD3[10], which
was signed by a valid digital signature from the Korean company
DTOPTOOLZ Co. Derusbi is a family of malware used by multiple
actor groups but associated exclusively with Chinese APT. TCIRT
began tracking the DTOPTOOLZ signature for additional signed
malware samples and memorialized them within our Threat
Intelligence Platform over time.
Analyst Comment: The DTOPTOOLZ signature has also been
observed in association with Korean Adware that is af�liated with the
actual DTOPTOOLZ Co. This adware should not be confused with the
APT malware that is abusing the same digital signature.
Later, in mid-November we discovered another implant that was
digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ signature. This implant,
MD5: 98721c78dfbf8a45d152a888c804427c[11], was from the
“Sakula” (aka. Sakurel) family of malware, a known variant of the
Derusbi backdoor, and was con�gured to communicate with the
malicious command and control (C2) domains
extcitrix.we11point[.]com and www.we11point[.]com. Through our
Farsight Security passive DNS[12] integration, we uncovered that
this malicious infrastructure was likely named in such a way to
impersonate the legitimate Wellpoint IT infrastructure.

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

Passive DNS and historic DomainTools Whois data also provided
insights that helped establish an initial timeline dating back to
April 2014, when the faux domains came into existence and were
later operationalized by the attackers. A Threat Intelligence
Platform should allow for analysts to easily put together and
organize such insights, collaborate around relevant analysis
internally, and share the �nished analysis with external industry
groups and organizations. In the hopes that our community
members could bene�t from or provide further insight into this
suspicious incident, we immediately shared our threat intelligence
including indicators, signatures and analytical context to the
ThreatConnect Medical and Health Community[13] on November
13, 2014. This included sending out a noti�cation to all
stakeholders as well as our followers on Twitter[14].
When the Anthem breach later came to light in early February, we
re-shared the signatures, indicators and context freely to the
entire ThreatConnect user base. As we dug further, we expanded
our understanding of the malicious we11point[.]com
infrastructure, taking particular interest to the subdomains such
as “extcitrix.we11point[.]com and “hrsolutions.we11point[.]com”.
Note the “citrix” and “hr” (human resources) pre�xes that the
adversary used to mirror legitimate remote infrastructure and
employee bene�ts resources in the May 2014 timeframe. This
provided initial insights as to the likely targeting themes and or
vectors in which the adversary may have used when initiating
their targeting campaign.

[15]

[16]

The fact that the malicious infrastructure closely mirrored other
legitimate Wellpoint infrastructure supported our hypothesis that
the Derusbi / Sakula malware was con�gured to operate and
persist within a speci�c target enterprise.

Possible Premera Blue Cross Infrastructure:
Retrospective analysis of other targeted malware samples using
the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature led to the identi�cation of
an “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” implant MD5:
02FAB24461956458D70AEED1A028EB9C[17]
(OpenOf�cePlugin.exe), which was �rst observed on December 11,
2013. Although this malware sample is not Derusbi / Sakula, it too
is strongly believed to be associated with Chinese APT activity and
in fact may have also been involved in a Blue Cross Blue Shield

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

targeting campaign as early as December 2013.

[18]

This particular binary is con�gured to connect to the static IP
address 142.91.76[.]134. Passive DNS of this IP indicates that on
December 11th, 2013, the same date as the malware sample was
observed, the domain prennera[.]com also resolved to
142.91.76[.]134. It is believed that the prennera[.]com domain may
have been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue
Cross[19], where the attackers used the same character
replacement technique by replacing the “m” with two “n”
characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would

7 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

be seen �ve months later with the we11point[.]com command and
control infrastructure.

Section Summary:
The Derusbi / Sakula malware implant types are unique in that
they have traditionally been seen within Chinese APT
espionage campaigns.
The “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” malware implant (while a
different family of malware than Derusbi / Sakula) is also
believed to be of Chinese origin, and was also digitally signed
with the DTOPTOOLZ digitalsignature. This implant
connected to a C2 node that overlapped with prennera[.]com.
We believe that the prennera[.]com domain may be
impersonating Premera Blue Cross (premera.com), using a
similar character replacement technique seen in the
we11point[.]com campaign.

VAE Inc. Themed Infrastructure & Signed
Malware
Another powerful attribute of ThreatConnect is the ability for
analysts to logically group items such as atomic indicators, related
documents or signatures, all of which may include individualized
custom context enrichments and associations. Over time, the
ability to memorialize groupings of related or like activity allows
analysts to quickly uncover non-obvious relationships within their
private datasets. This is exactly what happened as we continued to
8 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

investigate these incidents.
As industry analysts and media speculated Chinese APT
involvement[20] in the Anthem breach, our focus into the Derusbi
/ Sakula malware signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital
signature shifted from the we11point[.]com incident to another
cluster of activity that occurred later in May 2014. We immediately
reviewed Incident 20140526B: vaeit APT[21], an incident that we
initially shared to our Subscriber Community on September 29,
2014 after conducting retrospective analysis.
[22]

[23]

Just as was the case with the we11point[.]com and prennera[.]com

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

incidents, the VAE, Inc. incident is also believed to be associated
with Chinese APT espionage activity. In this case the adversary
also used Derusbi / Sakula malware that was signed with the
DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature and con�gured to communicate
with faux infrastructure appearing to be masquerading as internal
resources for the Department of Defense Contractor VAE, Inc.
Additionally, in response to an inquiry from KrebsOnSecurity,
VAE, Inc. would later con�rm[24] that it had indeed been a target
of a failed spearphishing attempt in May 2014 which used the
malicious faux VAE, Inc. themed domain.
The targeted incident relied upon the Sakula executable MD5:
230D8A7A60A07DF28A291B13DDF3351F[25] which had a XOR
0x9A encoded C2 callbacks to the IP address 192.199.254[.]126
(registered to Wehostwebsites[.]com – “Tom Yu” of Baoan,
Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China) as well as a
hardcoded callback to sharepoint-vaeit[.]com. Passive DNS of the
static C2 IP 192.199.254[.]126 revealed a single suspicious domain
of interest – topsec2014[.]com. This domain had historic
resolution around May 8, 2014 within a month of the �rst
observed Sakula activity using the IP 192.199.254[.]126 as C2.
[26]

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

[27]

Using historic Whois, we discovered that topsec2014[.]com
was initially registered by li2384826402@yahoo[.]com on May 6th,
2014. Although the li2384826402@yahoo[.]com registrant is likely
a reseller given that it has been observed registering several
thousands of other domains, the fact that it was used to register
both the faux VAE, Inc. C2 infrastructure and the overlapping
domain topsec2014[.]com within the same month suggests that
there may be a relationship between the client of the reseller for
the VAE, Inc. infrastructure and the client for topsec2014[.]com.
[28]

11 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

[29]

Just four minutes after the initial registration of topsec2014[.]com,
the Whois records were updated from the initial registrant, Li
Ning – li2384826402@yahoo[.]com to TopSec China –
TopSec_2014@163[.]com. This domain record has been
unchanged since May 7th 2014. The we11point[.]com
infrastructure and by extension the faux VAE Inc. infrastructure is
associated with Cluster 2 of the ScanBox framework[30] by PwC.
The latest PwC update to ScanBox states that there are “links
between the domain allegedly used in the Anthem hack
(we11point.com) to Cluster 2 through shared WHOIS details.”

OPM Themed Infrastructure
One notable pattern was how the domain Whois registration
information for the VAE, Inc. themed infrastructure was quickly
updated and obfuscated with pseudorandom 10 character
gmx.com email addresses and using the names of various comic
book characters from the Iron Man franchise. This comic-themed
naming convention has been previously documented by our
friends at Crowdstrike[31] in what they characterize as being
associated with a Chinese APT group they have dubbed “Deep
Panda”.
Leveraging our DomainTools partnership, we were able to
12 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

correlate the outlier domain opm-learning[.]org. This domain was
also purportedly registered by the Iron Man movie hero “Tony
Stark” on July 28, 2014. This infrastructure naming convention
suggests a possible Of�ce of Personnel Management (OPM)
theme. However, in this case we lacked any speci�c sample of
malware to verify our initial suspicions that this infrastructure
was operational. The possible OPM reference in the domain name
is noteworthy considering it was revealed in July of 2014 that OPM
had been compromised[32] by a likely state-sponsored Chinese
actor in mid-March of that year. The fact this domain was
registered after the breach occurred suggests that OPM could be
an ongoing direct target of Chinese state-sponsored cyber
espionage activity.
Our attention then turned to the FBI Flash Report A-000049MW[33] that was publicly reported by Brian Krebs [34]on February
6th, 2015. This FBI Flash Report was issued on January 27th, 2015,
the same day an Anthem administrator detected suspicious
activity according to an internal memo[35]. This memo goes on to
indicate that the FBI would not be party to the Anthem breach
until they were noti�ed on January 29th, 2015; based on these
facts we assess with high con�dence that it is very unlikely that
the FBI Flash Report was directly related to the Anthem breach.
Rather, we suspect that the FBI �ash report likely references the
USIS breach that was announced[36] on August 6, 2014, or the
previous OPM breach, considering the statement that the breach
involved “compromised and stolen sensitive business information
and Personally Identi�able Information (PII) from US commercial and

13 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

government networks through cyber espionage.”
The malware referenced within the FBI Report is associated with a
Derusbi backdoor subvariant named “InfoAdmin” / “Kakfum”
where the FBI speci�cally references open source reporting of
“Deep Panda” as being related to the malware observed in the
attack. The malicious infrastructure highlighted in the report are
the domains images.googlewebcache[.]com and
smtp.outlookssl[.]com. Both of these top level domains were
included with other related domains, all of which were shared on
September 16th, 2013 to the ThreatConnect Subscriber
Community in Incident 20130823C: Some.Trouble APT
Domains[37], roughly a year and half prior to the FBI Flash report.
It is important to mention that both the domains
images.googlewebcache[.]com and smtp.outlookssl[.]comas were
also previously identi�ed in an October 2014 PwC blog post[38] as
seen within Cluster 1 of the Scanbox framework, while the Sakula
activity with we11point and VAEIT is contained within Cluster 2 of
that report. This implies that the actor referenced within the FBI
Flash report uses shared capabilities (in this case the ScanBox kit)
with the Sakula / we11point actor.

Section Summary:
The Derusbi / Sakula malware seen in both the
we11point[.]com and VAE Inc. campaigns were structurally the
same and digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ signature.
14 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

The emerging theme is that this particular signature and
family of malware is highly indicative of a particular Chinese
APT activity.
Within this web of malicious infrastructure, there is an
interesting overlap with the topsec2014[.]com domain and
attack infrastructure.
TCIRT identi�ed a domain opm-learning[.]org that had a
similar superhero themed WHOIS registrant to the Sakula /
VAE Inc. infrastructure. The possible OPM reference is
noteworthy considering the Of�ce of Personnel Management
(OPM) was compromised in March 2014. Additionally, an FBI
Flash Report 0000-49MW referenced indicators that were
possibly associated with the USIS hack and a Derusbi variant
called “Kakfum” / “InfoAdmin”. Both the FBI Flash
infrastructure and the Sakula / VAE Inc. infrastructure are tied
to the capability usage of the ScanBox framework, residing in
Clusters 1 and 2 respectively.

Unveiling Song Yubo and Southeast University:
The Professor
We conducted open source research in pursuit of further
information on the TopSec_2014@163[.]com email registrant. A
keyword search returned several results for
“topsec2014@163[.]com” in association with a number of
academic institutions in Nanjing, China. Although the email

15 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

address wasn’t an exact match to the topsec2014[.]com domain
registrant (notice the absence of the underscore), such a similarity
warranted further investigation.
[39]

[40]

16 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

We examined the links for any relevant intelligence, and
discovered that nearly all of the search results led to pages that
contained an announcement for an information security
competition sponsored by the Southeast University-Topsec
Information Security and Mobile Internet Technology Joint
Research Center. This entity appears to be a joint research
venture between the University and Chinese networking giant
Beijing Topsec Network Security Technology Co., a.k.a. Beijing
Topsec.
[41]

17 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

[42]

The announcements list a Professor “Song Yubo” as the point of
contact for the event, and directs interested parties to his email
address, topsec2014@163[.]com, for further questions.
[43]

[44]

According to his LinkedIn page, Song is a Teacher at the Southeast
University, speci�cally interested in the �eld of
telecommunications. Additionally, he is an avid researcher, and
has published numerous academic papers on computer network
exploitation on various e-journal publication sites, such as Google
Scholar[45]. Further, he lists skills such as “cryptography,”
“penetration testing” and “computer network security,” etc. on his
Research Gate pro�le[46].

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

[47]

[48]

As we continued to develop a pro�le on Professor Song, we began
to have the sense that his interest in information security research
strongly overlapped with that of someone who might be interested
in or at least capable of conducting sophisticated cyber attacks.
However, interests alone are not enough to warrant reasonable
suspicion, so we had to do more digging.
Additionally, the soft link between TopSec_2014@163[.]com and
topsec2014@163[.]com alone was not suf�cient to make
19 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

associations with any reasonable con�dence, but as it turns out,
Yubo has in fact been previously named as a person of interest in
the context of offensive Chinese cyber activity.

The University
In March 2012, Northrop Grumman presented a commissioned
report to Congress[49] detailing Chinese cyber warfare capabilities.
The report asserts with high con�dence that both Song and the
Information Security Research Center at Southeast University
have received numerous state-sponsored research grants, and by
extension, cooperated with the Government of China in
conducting information security research and development
(R&D). As stated on Southeast University’s own website, the main
purpose of these grants are to develop technical acumen amongst
its students via providing support for “state-owned scienti�c
research institutions, state key enterprises, government agencies
and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) units.”
[50]

20 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

[51]

Southeast University is one of only three Chinese academic
institutes that receives funding from all �ve of the State grant
programs. Song himself has also conducted his fair share of statesponsored research, notably under the National Ministry of State
Security 115 Program – a highly sensitive research grant to fund
ambiguous information warfare R&D, almost certainly in support
of PLA programs.

The Competition
As we can see, the evidence continued to stack up. The real
smoking gun, however, was when we began to notice a strong
temporal overlap with the various stages of the TOPSEC Cup that
Song and Beijing Topsec were organizing, and the registration
dates of malicious infrastructure as well as the malware
compilation dates.
[52]

21 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

[53]

Based upon the translated registration form that we obtained from
Song Yubo’s personal Baidu document sharing account, open
registration for the “TOPSEC Cup” began on May 4th, 2014 and
would close on May 14th, 2014.
The details of the competition that were shared on the
announcement are extremely ambiguous, and probably for good
reason. The introductory paragraph mentions that the primary
goal of the event is to facilitate the training and discovery of new
talent, noting that exceptional participants would receive priority
consideration for internships and jobs with Beijing Topsec.
The event itself was broken down into several distinct rounds of
competition. Firstly, the preliminary round required that all
eligible registrants would attempt to remotely access and navigate
through the network. Should a participating team perform
exceptionally in the preliminary qualifying round, they would be
invited to participate in the �nal round on-site in Nanjing.

22 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

In this �nal round, participants would be required to build their
own “information systems and network environments.” The
announcement notes that the students must rely upon their own
laptop and software tools to accomplish this task. Further, the
announcement notes that participants are prohibited from
attacking the provided server as well as their competitors.

Section Summary:
Song Yubo and his research center at Southeast University
appear to be central players in this narrative, as highlighted by
their �nancial connections to the government of China, in
particular the Ministry of State Security (MSS), China’s premier
human intelligence agency.
If the MSS was involved, we can deduce that the Anthem hack
could have been for the purposes of gathering sensitive
information for follow-on HUMINT targeting via
blackmail, asset recruitment or technical targeting operations
against individuals at home.
Song’s use of the topsec email alias suggests a greater
association w/ TOPSEC.
It seems as if the competition is almost certainly the cause for
the topsec2014[.]com domain. What is very curious, however,
is the initial registration by the reseller
li2384826402@yahoo[.]com, which is a tactic seen within the
con�rmed malicious faux VAE Inc.infrastructure.
The overlap between the competition website and the static
command and control infrastructure seen in the Derusbi /

Sakula implant is was likely an error made by the attackers.

Tianrongxin, a.k.a. Beijing Topsec Technology
Co:
The Company
To enhance our open-source capabilities, we partnered up with Dr.
James Mulvenon[54] and his team of China experts at Defense
Group, Inc. (DGI)[55]. We shared with them everything that we
knew at the time, walking through the technical details which led
us all the way to Song Yubo and the competition announcement.
From there, they were able to uncover a wealth of very
consequential background information on Beijing Topsec
Technology Co (Beijing Topsec), the sponsoring organization for
Song Yubo’s information security competition.
DGI’s research indicated that Beijing Topsec is one of the largest
information security hardware providers in China. In 1996, they
were the �rst Chinese company to break into the market with the
release of China’s �rst indigenously-manufactured �rewall. Since
then, they have expanded their business to include a consulting
practice focused on issues such as vulnerability mining, software
code analysis, threat intelligence, and encryption R&D, amongst
other things.
The company served as a core technical support unit for network

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

security at the 2008 Olympic Games – an event which was tightly
controlled by the state. Additionally, Beijing Topsec is a known
partner of the Chinese military. Since 2009, the company has
possessed information publication credentials for military
network procurement. Since 2013, they have been publicly
recognized as the Chinese equivalent of a cleared defense
contractor.
The links between Beijing Topsec and the Chinese government are
fairly substantial, highlighted by long-standing partnerships
between even the most shadowy elements of the Chinese military.

The Leaked Cable
A very compelling piece of evidence is found in the contents of a
leaked 2009 diplomatic security cable from the Department of
State, published by The Guardian.[56] The cable is a daily digest of
Diplomatic Security alerts – essentially a situational awareness
primer for State Department employees to inform them of new
and existing threats. In one section, the cable highlights that the
Founder of Beijing Topsec, He Weidong, had openly talked about
receiving directives from the PLA in an interview with China News
Network. In the interview, the founder quite curiously states that
Topsec is less a commercial entity, but rather a research institute,
and that the company received about half of its start-up capital
directly from the PLA. The cable further claims that Topsec
actively recruits for the PLA cyber army.

[57]

[58]

It would also appear that not only does Beijing Topsec have deep
ties to state-run cyber activity, but also within the independent
hacker community as well. Of note, the company hired the
notorious hacker Lin Yong, a.k.a. “Lion” (of the Honker Union of
China[59]) in the early 2000s as a security service engineer and to
conduct network training.

Section Summary:
It is not surprising that the Chinese government would be
interested in partnering with a private organization such as
Beijing Topsec for use as a front for state-sponsored activity.
The association between Southeast University and Beijing
Topsec as manifested in the joint information security research
center highlights the possibility of growing links between

26 of 33

03/22/2015 10:14 PM

http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-...

state-sponsored activity and academic institutions,
particularly those that receive funding from the central
government.
All in all, it would seem that China is pursuing a uni�ed
approach to cyber operations, relying on all unique facets of
the workforce: academia, private industry, and independent
hackers, as well as the PLA to achieve their strategic goals.

Conclusion:
The Anthem breach exposes the insidious reality of modern
Chinese cyber espionage as it continues its unrelenting strikes at
the soft underbelly of the American way of life. Moreover, it
demonstrates the imposing yet increasingly common reality of
conducting threat intelligence analysis without substantial threat
intelligence to start with. Fortunately for us, we were able to
deduce informed answers to some of the outstanding questions to
this breach by scrutinizing our archival data troves that are
ef�ciently stored within our Threat Intelligence Platform and
partner integrations. In the �eld of cyber security, industry
professionals must learn to play the long game in order to
generate a proactive sense of situational awareness, allowing for
greater ef�ciency and �exibility in mitigating future threats.
Additionally, this incident underscores the frustrating disparity of
the industry when it comes to naming conventions. With so many
threat actors and indicators �oating around, it is can be
frustrating to keep track of all the disparate pieces of evidence,

especially when countless naming conventions are applied.
Without the use of a Threat Intelligence Platform to keep track of
the �ood of incoming threat data, this task would be
extraordinarily time consuming at best and crippling at worst.
Moving forward, it is important to bear in mind that the adversary,
regardless of country of origin, shall almost certainly leverage our
every weakness against us. Even something as seemingly
innocuous as confusion over names can easily consume analytical
bandwidth, creating a window of opportunity to strike. We – that
is security professionals, private industry and governments alike –
must proactively harden our network defenses and hasten our
incident responses as a united, synchronous entity.
We have shared details on Song Yubo[60] and af�liated indicators
within the ThreatConnect Common Community. This share also
includes the full-text DGI “BLUE HERON” research[61] which
provides greater insight into Song Yubo, Southeast University and
Beijing Topsec.
All things considered, industry must learn to adopt a cooperative
defense mindset in the hopes of rebuf�ng future attacks. The most
resolute defense we have is each other, so be like the TCIRT and
start actively defending your own community from the next big
breach. Register for a free ThreatConnect account today[62] to get
