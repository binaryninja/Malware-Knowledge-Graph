Last year Zscaler[3] wrote an article detailing a new version of Amadey “a2020 Amadey” that
came with two new plugins ‘cred.dll’ and ‘scr.dll’. Recently, Amadey has been updated again to
a new version “a2021 Amadey.” This article aims to go over some interesting additions to their
stealer plugin component.

help parse these files[2] for recovering lost credentials.

Another addition is the parsing of Outlook profiles from registry in order to harvest account data:

Loaders such as Amadey continue to update their toolsets for selling on the underground and
the addition of Outlook account and Mikrotik account harvesting shouldn’t surprise anyone as
both can be valuable data sets for criminal activities.
