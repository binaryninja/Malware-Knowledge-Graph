Web)

November 11, 2022

The ASEC analysis team uploaded a post on October 25th to inform the users of the changes that have
been made to the Magniber ransomware. Magniber, which is still actively being distributed, has
undergone many changes to evade the detection of anti-malware software. Out of these changes, this
blog will cover the script format found from September 8th to September 29th, 2022, which bypassed
Mark of the Web (MOTW), a feature offered by Microsoft that identifies the source of files.

Table 1. Major characteristics of Magniber ransomware by date (https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/40422/)
Table 1 shows the content of the ASEC blog post which covers the evolution of the Magniber
ransomware. Among these changes, the threat operator used scripts as the distribution method during
the period from September 8th to September 29th, 2022. Magniber was downloaded through the
typosquatting method, which exploits typos made by the user when accessing domains (See Figure 1).

Figure 1. Typosquatting distribution method of Magniber
The downloaded file is identified to be from an external source by the Windows Mark of the Web (MOTW)
feature.[2] MOTW operates on New Technology File System (NTFS). The download URL is recorded in a
stream in Windows of NTFS.[3] The stream where the URL is saved is created in the file path in the format
of “File Name:Zone.Identifier:$DATA” and can be easily viewed with Notepad. When the downloaded files
identified by MOTW are executed, a warning message is displayed.

Figure 2. File recorded by MOTW
In order to bypass such execution blocks by MOTW, Magniber used a digital signature at the end of the
script during the period between September 8th and September 29th, 2022. Through signing after the
script is compiled, a digital signature on the script[4] guarantees that the script has not been modified, and
provides a way to identify the author of the script. According to a post published on Bleeping Computer,[1]
the digital signature at the end of the Magniber ransomware script is added to bypass MOTW.

Figure 3. Magniber distribution script (wsf, js, jse)
Currently, Magniber is being distributed with an MSI file extension instead of a script format. However,
user vigilance is still required as it goes through frequent changes in its technique to bypass detection.
Additionally, users must be careful when executing files downloaded from untrusted websites.
Currently, AhnLab is responding to the Magniber ransomware with not only file detection but also with
various detection methods. Thus, it is recommended that users activate the Process Memory Scan and
the Malicious Script Detection (AMSI) options in [V3 Preferences] – [PC Scan Settings].
