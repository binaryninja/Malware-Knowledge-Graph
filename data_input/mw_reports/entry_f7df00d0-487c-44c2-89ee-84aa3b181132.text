Yesterday, ID-Ransomware's Michael Gillespie discovered a new variant of the
Crysis/Dharma ransomware that is appending the .arena extension to encrypted files. It is
not known exactly how this variant is being distributed, but in the past Crysis was typically
spread by hacking into Remote Desktop Services and manually installing the ransomware.
When this ransomware is installed, it will scan the computer for certain file types and encrypt
them. When encrypting a file it will append an extension in the format of .id-[id].
[email].arena. For example, a file called test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed
to test.jpg.id-BCBEF350.[chivas@aolonline.top].arena.
It should be noted that this ransomware will encrypt mapped network drives and unmapped
network shares. So it is important to make sure your network's shares are locked down so
that only those who actually need access have permission.
You can see an example of an encrypted folder below.

Files encrypted with the Crysis Arena Ransomware Variant

While encrypting a computer it will also remove all of the shadow volume copies so that you
cannot use them to restore your files. It deletes them by running the vssadmin delete
shadows /all /quiet command.
The Arena Crysis variant will also create two ransom notes. One is the info.hta file, which is
launched by an autorun.

2/36

Crysis Arena Ransom Note

The other note is called FILES ENCRYPTED.txt.

FILES Encrypted Ransom Note

Both of these ransom notes contain instructions to contact chivas@aolonline.top in order
to get payment instructions.
Finally, the ransomware will configure itself to automatically start when you login to
Windows. This allows it to encrypt new files that are created since it was last executed.

It is not possible to decrypt the Crysis Arena Ransomware Variant
Unfortunately, at this time it is not possible to decrypt .arena files encrypted by the Crysis
Ransomware for free.

3/36

The only way to recover encrypted files is via a backup, or if you are incredibly lucky, through
Shadow Volume Copies. Though Crysis does attempt to remove Shadow Volume Copies, in
rare cases ransomware infections fail to do so for whatever reason. Due to this, if you do not
have a viable backup, I always suggest people try as a last resort to restore encrypted files
from Shadow Volume Copies as well.
For those who wish to discuss the Crysis ransomware or need support, you can use our
dedicated Crysis Ransomware Help & Support Topic.

How to protect yourself from the Crysis Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from Crysis, or from any ransomware, it is important that you use
good computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a
reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such
as a ransomware attack.
You should also have security software that contains behavioral detections such as Emsisoft
Anti-Malware or Malwarebytes.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following good online security habits, which in
many cases are the most important steps of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure
you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs
contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.
Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.
If you are using Remote Desktop Services, do not connect it directly to the Internet.
Instead make it accessibly only via a VPN.

Does anybody still have the original virus? I have been speaking with some experts and
they say If they get a copy they can maybe reverse engineer it?

Thanks. Got it, I'll let everyone know when we have something working. meanwhile, if
you or anyone else have a handful of small encrypted files you can send me for testing?
there are a few keys in use so will be good to have a variety to test on.
thanks!

Gski - 4 years ago

I received the decryptor program which scanned my encrypted files and located 15 keys.
This program then generated a file which was sent to the hacker. The hacker then sent
me a key to paste into the same program and it restored all files which had his email
address in the file name. along with the Hexidecimal code test.jpg.id-CC44FDAC.
[email@Emailaddress].arena
I can upload the program and submitted and received keys if it helps someone. Still
have a bunch of files with another email address in the name that were not decrypted.
Hopefully someone can reverse engineer to help others.

I just had a call that a computer was infected in the last 24 hours with the arena

I´m very interested in getting back my familyfotos and word-docs.
Thank you !

Robert0101 - 4 years ago

Gski, It would be a huge help to everyone if you could please update on your experience
with the decryptor program. I would also like to get a copy of this decryptor and see if it
will help with repairing the files I am in desperate need of repair.
I think for sure there would be some reward money in it for you if you could supply
more information and some of the major AntiVirus developers could produce a tool like
the RakhniDecryptor. Please respond.

my server has been encrypted but was a Test Server.
On the server is still the ENCRYPTOR software!! Someone of you can "need" this to

I received this program from mailme@italymail.com
All my files were encrypted with either mailme@italymail.com or sconor3@aol.com in
the file name descriptor
HELP_DECRYPT.PNG.id-CC44FDAC.[sconor3@aol.com].arena
This program & key only worked on the files with mailme@italymail.com in the file
name:
Decryptor Program:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_q_-yttmBtqelRhWk5FcG90MjQ
Encryption Key to insert after hitting Decrypt button:
Copy from this file and paste into program
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_q_-yttmBtqYnNsYll5SlV0UGc
Not sure it will work on anyone else's files unless you have mailme@italymail.com in
the filename
Good luck

netmedia - 4 years ago

Thanks, I'll try it out right away. however the e-mail address is different.
web-tables.xml.id-B8745C0A.[pepsicola@femconc.com].arena

Robert0101 - 4 years ago

Dear all,
If anyone has any more success with getting a decryption tool , or finds a solution to
this terrible ransomware, it would help all here if they can share the experience.
Gski has done a great thing sharing his decryption tool from the hacker. I am working
very hard on finding a solution for everyone too, plus I have some people working 20
hours per day on this.
1) Is this really a new variant of the CrySIS ransomware?
if so, then surely we should all be putting pressure on Kaspersky, Trend Micro and
ESET to update their tools
https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html
I'm personally in direct communication with Kaspersky Virus Lab. I am persuading
them to update the Rakhni Decryptor. I'm sure Gski's files are hugely helpful
https://noransom.kaspersky.com/
If there are any other received decryption tools , then please let me know in a private
message asap.
Personally I am looking to recover design artwork files, but I'm sure for the greater
good of all those who lost family photos etc, we will ALL appreciate a team effort to beat
the hackers.
If I get any news from Kaspersky I will share on this post.

Hello ,
Same encryption over here , but different mailadress :
.[sm@uwmanage.com].arena
They decyphered a document for proof they got the key.
And they want 1 bitcoin for decryption tool.

dkittitat - 4 years ago

Hi, I got my files encrypted too. I sent them an email and they asked how many infected
computer, removable drive or NAS. The price for decryption tool is depending on
infected computer. I answerd just 1 computer and they replied they wanted 1 bitcoin to
decrypt my files.

21/36

urosbe - 4 years ago

Same here. Our client's computer was encrypted with .id-BE00F590.
[support@decrypt.ws].arena file extension due to open RDP port (non-default).
Fortunatelly they have daily backup for most important data, but there are other files
that I would like to recover. Data Recovery (Recuva was most efficient) did some small
job, but not with large files. Price for decryption is 0.5 bitcoin if they pay within first 24
hours or 1 bitcoin after that. I have send them 3 sample files to decrypt but since then
no answer so far. System is stable and running again, I have saved encrypted files for
later and waiting for decrypting tool.
How long does it usually takes that encryption key is broken and is it possible that there
won't be decryption tool at all for some randomware? I have read that some that it was
not possible to break keys for some of them before attackers published their keys?

Any update on a decryption key? Got hit on Friday after stupidly opening up RDP to a
home media server (I know, I know :( ), several terabytes of media encrypted, which I
can deal with, but some personal photos too. They're on a hard drive somewhere, but
following a house move, so far unsuccessful in locating them!

Gski - 4 years ago

Do not pay a ransom to Sarah Conor at sconor3@aol.com. The hacker did provide
evidence of the ability to decrypt 2 files, but when we paid in bitcoins for the decryptor
program and key, the hacker stopped responding and did not provide either. Doesn't
seem quite right, but there are hackers who are concerned about their reputations, this
hacker obviously does not and will only take your money.

Gski - 4 years ago

SCONOR3@aol.com - UPDATE
So my efforts with my 2nd decryptor program involving [sconor3@aol.com] continues.
Four weeks after payment, I was contacted by sconor3@aol.com that there is a new
person working there who can be trusted. They will send me the decryptor program and
keys if I agree to write an endorsement here if successful. Their justification was the
previous person was fired for being untrustworthy. I will let others know who follow me
if I've had a successful transaction. Do not pay any bitcoins yet until I report back.

24/36

Gski - 4 years ago

I have received a decryptor program from SCONOR3@aol.com as promised, scanned
my files and the program generated a key file to return. I have sent the Key File to
SCONOR3@aol.com and will report back if a SCONOR3@aol.com returns the
decrypting key and all files are unlocked. Please be patient and do not pay your bitcoins
until you hear back from me regarding success.

Gski - 4 years ago

I am sorry to report that 15 hours after sending the program generated key I still have
not received the unlock key. Waiting to see if the new management will keep their
promises. Please do not send any bitcoins to SCONOR3@aol.com until you have
confirmation from me that this person is trustworthy.

Gski - 4 years ago

Sorry friends. I was under the impression that SCONOR3@aol.com was under a new
person that could be trusted. It does not appear that you will have any success with
SCONOR3@aol.com. Negotiations have not gone as planned and you should never pay
this person.

25/36

TheRonaldPerson - 4 years ago

I've seen a new version of this, with the extension [decrypt.guarantee@aol.com].block
The ransom note was identical otherwise, including the bad English.
We received decoded sample files as proof, so they do have the decryptor.
DO NOT PAY! We did, had no choice, but they DID NOT send the decryptor! They just
kept demanding more money.
So, if this email address or file extension hits you, be warned, these guys DO NOT keep
their word, even if you pay.

help-decrypt - 4 years ago

Also:
Do not pay a ransom to "Can Help" with email restorefile@india.com !!!
They give a good discount - from 1 btc they lower the price 2-3 times, but the decryptor
is not sent!
We have paid. As soon as we paid they stopped responding to emails. These hackers do
not care about their reputation ...
But i would advise everyone not to pay ransom.

26/36

help-decrypt - 4 years ago

So, my story with [restorefile@india.com] continues.
After almost two weeks after payment, extortionists contacted me and sent the decoder
and keys! Their justification was - all my letters were in the spam.
I think it happened because I wrote on the web that they do not fulfill their obligations.
It worked with them - they even asked to edit the message.
Obviously [restorefile@india.com] take care of their reputation.

klyxmaster - 4 years ago

Can you post or upload what you have to so others may benifit? My system has a
differnt encryption, but It may work to unlock them - Much of my important stuff is on
back up, but my academic stuff is encrypted.

27/36

Robert0101 - 4 years ago

Update:
The Arena variant of this ransomware uses a "cryptographically secure algorithm".
Kaspersky currently do not have a decryption tool, however imho I think they could and
should update the RakhniDecryptor.
Kaspersky are calling "arena" a Crusis variant :
https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/disinfection/10556#block1
Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Crusis:
.ID<…>.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.xtbl
.ID<…>.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.CrySiS
.id-<…>.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.xtbl
.id-<…>.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.wallet
.id-<…>.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.dhrama
.id-<…>.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.onion
.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.wallet
.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.dhrama
.<mail>@<server>.<domain>.onion
It all looks very familiar right?
I have given up on Kaspersky, I think it's possible they have much bigger fish to fry ,
especially in Russia with "Bad Rabbit" and other political issues.
I have had a long conversation with the hacker and its clear that they can only provide
the decryption tool for the trojan virus they dropped with their email address in the file
name.
E.g. support@decrypt.ws cannot decrypt the file locked by decrypt.guarantee@aol.com
and vice versa.
Therefore the decryption tool that I might have received will not help anyone else ,
except a tiny possibility if you were infected by the same hacker as me. (same email
address in the file name). But that would again be a chance in a million that the unlock
keys actually worked on your cryptographic algorithm.

28/36

I know this is not the news we want to hear, but the only options you have now are:
1) Put all the file on a external disk and hold on for 6 months - 1 year to see if anyone
updates the Crysis / Crusis / Dharma decryption tools.
Keep checking: https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html
2) Read post #1066 [CHAPTER 4]
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/632389/dharma-ransomwarefilenameemailwalletceserarena-support-topic/page-72
Hope you get a result and only give money that you are prepared to lose.
3) Accept the loss and make sure have a better backup strategy because ransomware is
going to increase as the price of bitcoin attracts more people.

klyxmaster - 4 years ago

I will never pay - the key will surface. I am pretty patient. But that's not to say Im not
steamed! I feel totally helpless, been on pc's since the early 80's, NEVER had this

I would be too, its not a secure site when dealing with these issues. Note the "http" vs
"https". If it was something like an art site, or gaming site, no biggy, but we are talking
about security issues, so either your promoting a suspicious site, or the site itself is
subject.

caciavar - 4 years ago

I can tell you that I'm definitely not promoting the site. A family member has been
affected by this ransomware and i'm trying to look for solutions. I agree with your
reasoning for why the site is suspicious.

klyxmaster - 4 years ago

OK, lets use some common sense here:
INFECTION
Whether you like it or not, You, family member or employee made use of torrents,
pirate sites or porn and any other suspect media to get what they wanted (and did not
check it) Simple as that. Netflix, google, utility co. banks, phone co. etc.. major search
engines etc.. are not gonna ransom your system.
With that said, these guys are bad guys (watch TV to better understand what a bad guy
is). they have NO INTENTION OF HELPING YOU! They prey on the idiots that pay
them. They don't care about those that are smart and know better. If you were smart
you would have had a back up anyways of your "important" media (seriously, who
doesn't back up their family pics, legal and business documents AND use that machine
to surf the unprotected web). I had 16TB of data locked up. I just wiped all the drives
and started from clean drives - why? I had all my good stuff backed up(stuff from 1992
yeowch!) - the rest of the stuff is replaceable over time.
So for those that feel the need to fork out money WASTEFULLY: PAY ME!! I need some
work on my truck, and would like to start a down payment on a new houseand dump
the condo scene (AND for those that have money to burn, pay me more - I would like to
start a pc education biz for conducting internet safety and security LOL), . What do you
get for paying me? same thing you get from these thieves: NOTHING. Just the peace of
mind that it went to a good cause.

I agree with you. More diligence needs to be taken with backing up sensitive data and
revisiting backup strategies periodically.
One thing I should mention though is that the cause of this infection in most cases is
not due to careless internet browsing, downloading torrents, porn or suspicious sites.
This occurs when a hacker breaches port 3389 for remote desktop and logs into the
target system to inflict the damage. The solution is better security practices such as
hardening firewalls and using remote desktop over VPN.
In my case, port 3389 was forwarded to a desktop on my parent's network and the
hacker exploited that security hole. It was my fault... I opened the back door to perform
some VPN maintenance remotely, and forgot to close it when I was finished. I feel
awful, but it's something I'll never do again.

I retract the porn,torrent and other subjective media:
I "sorta agree", The only way for that port (or ANY port) to be exploited, is that it has to
be forewarded - unless you are some super wanted politician, movie(**cough**)star or
some other person of interest, and then you would be targeted. However, that does not
seem to be the case here.
I run many game server, and host my own web server. Never really ran into any issue so
to speak.
As you already admitted - you forwarded port 3389* - Many others I have dealt with,
don't have a single port forwarded( or even know how to do it) outside some gaming
ports for online gaming. But for the most part, those are pretty protected anyways. 9
already open and ripe for the picking? Random "port sniffing" might be the cause.
But I agree with you on the 3389, I forgot to turn mine off that night. I was hopping
back and forth for some data, and just too lazy to shut it off. not too surprisingly, BAM!
next morning system was running HORRIBLY slow. Takes awhile to lock up 16tb LOL.
I was able to shut the system off before it killed my windows, but the damage was done.
Restore took FOREVER!
