Each month, the Intel team provides Red Canary customers with an analysis of trending,
emerging, or otherwise important threats that we’ve encountered in confirmed threat
detections, intelligence reporting, and elsewhere over the preceding month. We call this
report our “Intelligence Insights” and share a public version of it with the broader infosec
community.

Highlights
In October 2021, we observed the same threats we’ve grown accustomed to seeing each
month. Though the relative rankings largely remained the same, the volume of activity
associated with Yellow Cockatoo and TA551 respectively decreased. Despite its ranking,
TA551 affected approximately 1.1% of customers in October, compared to 2.5% of
customers in September. Similarly, Yellow Cockatoo affected approximately 1.1% of
customers in October, compared to 2.7% in September. Lest you get complacent and think
these prevalent threats are waning, the end of the month saw a surge from a previously
prolific phisher pushing a familiar foe: Qbot is on the rise again, propelled by TR campaigns
leveraging SquirrelWaffle. More on that and other interesting insights from the month are
below.

As we’ve done for the past few months, we again looked at the 10 most prevalent threats
encountered in the environments that Red Canary monitors. These prevalence rankings are
based on the number of unique customer environments in which we observed each threat.
For more information on any of these threats, check out Intelligence Profiles. Here’s how
the numbers shook out for October 2021:

NodeJS with a side of XMRig
Third-party developer libraries and packages are an inescapable part of modern
development, and the compromise of one package can cascade and affect multiple
subsequent packages that depend on a single one. While fallout from a compromise of a
popular NPM package last month appears relatively limited, the incident was a stark
reminder of how adversaries can exploit organizations’ reliance on trusted development
tools. In fact, as we’re getting ready to publish this, we’re investigating a new potentially
compromised package.
In October 2021, Red Canary identified a compromised package in NPM, a package
distribution and management utility for JavaScript libraries. The compromised version of the
package, ua-parser-js , distributed an XMRig cryptominer to Windows and Linux
systems, as well as an infostealer (likely DanaBot) to Windows systems. Though the
package is downloaded nearly 8 million times each week and the impact could have been
widespread, GitHub quickly issued an advisory warning users that updating that package,
or anything that depended on it, would initiate malicious behavior on affected systems.
In this case, we detected the compromised version of ua-parser-js with detectors
designed to identify the cryptominer and infostealer it distributed. Detection opportunities for
this category of threat inherently depend on which malware a poisoned package contains.

Detection opportunity: Certutil downloading a file
This detection opportunity will identify instances of Certificate Authority Utility
( certutil.exe ) with command-line arguments to download an arbitrary file. This
behavior is commonly observed across multiple threats and is one reliable way adversaries
use to download tools on Windows.
process == certutil.exe
&&
command_line_contains == urlcache

When TR delivers SquirrelWaffle, ransomware precursors may soon
follow…

3/10

In late October 2021, Red Canary observed an uptick in detections involving TR (a delivery
affiliate) and SquirrelWaffle. In some cases where we detected TR delivering SquirrelWaffle,
we observed additional payloads and domain reconnaissance beginning within minutes.
The short dwell time, combined with recent external reporting that suggests new TR
tradecraft can bypass certain email protections, highlights the need to detect and respond
to these behaviors in near real time to avoid late-stage activity such as ransomware.
Recent initial access tradecraft may allow adversaries to bypass certain
protections provided by secure email gateways, increasing the odds that a
malicious email is delivered to users’ inboxes. In early November, security
researchers reported that TR used compromised, on-premises Exchange servers to
send malicious emails to potential victims. As context, successful exploitation of
Microsoft Exchange on-premises products enables system access, control of an
enterprise email server, and access to enterprise email accounts. This access
effectively allows an adversary to send and receive email from a victim’s account with
the legitimacy of a trusted, internal sender.
Decreased dwell time underscores the criticality of detecting and responding to
ransomware precursor activity quickly. In one incident, operators executed Cobalt
Strike and BloodHound—hallmark ransomware precursors—only 75 minutes after a
user first opened the malicious XLS phishing lure that initiated SquirrelWaffle. Short
dwell times necessitate a clear understanding of adversary behavior and a robust
toolbox of detection analytics to identify this behavior.

Detection opportunity: Excel spawning Regsvr32
This detection opportunity will identify instances of regsvr32.exe spawning as a child
process of Microsoft Excel. This behavior is commonly observed in malicious documents
with macros or Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) execution, notably SquirrelWaffle XLS
documents delivered by TR.
parent_process == excel.exe
&&
process == regsvr32.exe

With a twinkle in its eyes, Gamarue makes the ascent
While most of us were reaching for our favorite pumpkin spice latte this past month,
Gamarue’s spot in our rankings suggests that many others opted to reach for their thumb
drives instead. Gamarue is a malware family used as part of a botnet. Some variants of
Gamarue are worms and frequently spread via infected USB drives. Gamarue has also

4/10

been used to spread other malware, steal information, and perform other activities such as
click fraud. This malware was first seen more than 10 years ago and evolved into multiple
variants before the operator was arrested in 2017.
Though Gamarue is no longer actively developed, it remains a pervasive threat. This
highlights the notion that even if a threat is no longer active, it still warrants consideration
from defenders tasked with responding to threats and building new detection logic.

Detection opportunity: Rundll32 Gamarue CLI
While we love to focus on detection opportunities that can identify multiple different threats
by identifying uncommon types of behavior, this detection opportunity focuses on activity
that is specific to multiple different Gamarue variants. Below you will find various examples
that can be used to identify these variants executing.

3. \\\\\\\\\\\~%%@@~%%@@~%%@@~.2,1abcDEfgHIJ2klM4
In conjunction with this detection opportunity, you may be able to identify the name of an
infected thumb drive that was plugged into the endpoint by looking for registry modifications
to UserAssist registry keys containing the ROT13 encoded string .yax at the same time.
These registry values can be decoded to look something like f:\usb drive (8gb).lnk ,
which may be indicative of a USB drive being the culprit.

process == rundll32.exe

Detection opportunity: Rundll32 spawning Explorer
This detection opportunity hinges on the likelihood of rundll32.exe spawning
explorer.exe . Red Canary often observes Gamarue spawning the explorer.exe
process in an unusual way.
parent_process == rundll32.exe
&&
process == explorer.exe

Detection opportunity: Msiexec No CLI + External Netconn
As we mentioned in our 2021 Threat Detection Report, Gamarue can still be detected by
identifying instances of the Windows Installer ( msiexec.exe ) into which it has been
injected. This type of activity can be identified by creating a detection analytic that focuses
on instances of Msiexec that have no associated command-line options or an external
network connection.
process == msiexec.exe
&&
command_line == “”
&&
has_external_netconn?

*Note: Double quotes (“”) within the command line means null.

New opportunities for detecting ransomware precursors
In October, we observed Conti and Lockbit affecting multiple customer environments.
Fortunately, there are several opportunities to detect precursor behavior for these threats.
Conti precursor activity
In October, we observed several new Qbot TTPs in environments ultimately encrypted with
Conti. Notably, we saw Qbot inject into Microsoft Synchronization Center ( mobsync.exe )
and drop Conti DLLs. Additionally, we saw Qbot inject into Windows Error Reporting
( werfault.exe ) with no command-line parameters. Following this, the adversary used the
xcopy utility to copy the malicious DLLs to different locations on the system. There are
multiple opportunities to detect this activity in your environment:

Detection opportunity: Mobsync creating unusual DLL files

6/10

This detection analytic will identify an unusual file modification stemming from the
mobsync.exe process. We determined this file was Conti ransomware in one incident.
process == mobsync.exe
&&
file_modification_create == *.dll

Detection opportunity: Werfault spawning with no command-line
parameters
This detection analytic will identify unusual activity originating from the werfault.exe
process. Werfault typically spawns with command-line parameters when a process crashes,
providing the program with input to create an error report.
process == werfault.exe
&&
command_line == “”

Detection opportunity: Xcopy moving files from Group Policy Object (GPO)
storage folder
Qbot created malicious files within the GPO storage folder during execution. Then, it used
the Extended Copy Utility ( xcopy.exe ) to copy malicious DLLs, including Conti. The
following analytic will identify this activity:
process == xcopy.exe
&&
command_line_contains == \Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\
&&
file_modification_create == *.dll
*Note: 31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9 is the default domain policy GUID
Lockbit precursor activity
During a recent Lockbit infection, the operators used PsExec to launch a batch script, which
initiated several commands designed to prepare the environment for encryption. The batch
script displayed the following actions:
set antivirus exclusion paths for C:\Programdata\ and C:\Windows\ that allowed
malicious binaries to exist in these paths without interference
deleted the Windows Defender service
disabled Windows Defender, User Account Control (UAC), and Windows Recovery
7/10

turned off all firewall rules
cleared multiple System and Security logs
The defense evasion and system recovery commands initiated by the script offer multiple
detection opportunities.

Detection opportunity: Disabling Windows Recovery via bcedit
In combination with the other commands witnessed in the same timeframe, the use of the
Boot Configuration editing tool ( bcdedit.exe ) to set specific recovery options helped us
identify malicious activity.
process == bcdedit.exe
&&
Parent_process == ( “rundll32.exe” || “regsvr32.dll” )
&&
command_line_contains == “recoveryenabled No”

Detection opportunity: Wevtutil clearing System and Security logs
The Windows Event Log Utility Tool ( wevtutil.exe ) process deleted both System and
Security event logs. This behavior is atypical in most environments.
process == wevtutil.exe
&&
command_line_contains == cl
&&
(command_line_contains == Security
||
command_line_contains == System )

Detection opportunity: Netsh turning off all firewall rules
Setting all of the system firewall rules to a state of “off” should be considered suspicious
and investigated further. While this may be a “normal” system administration function in
some cases, it merits close review when observed with other activity associated with
Lockbit.
process == netsh.exe
&&
command_line_contains == advfirewall set allprofiles state off
