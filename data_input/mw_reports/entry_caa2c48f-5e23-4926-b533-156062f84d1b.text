Conti and Hive ransomware operations: What we learned
from these groups' victim chats
blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/conti-and-hive-ransomware-operations.html

As part of Cisco Talos’ continuous efforts to learn more about the current ransomware
landscape, we recently examined a trove of chat logs between the Conti and Hive
ransomware gangs and their victims.
Ransomware-as-a-service groups have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with
these groups continually adding new affiliates and tools. In the past, we’ve learned more
about these groups by speaking directly with operators and examining these groups’
changing tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).

Talos researchers recently spent weeks combing through chat logs and other information we
obtained from Hive and Conti operators' conversations with victims. These conversations
had not previously been made public. The research paper we’re releasing today contains
new insights into how Conti and Hive choose their targets, negotiate with victims, operate
internally, and much more.
