France Ties Russia's Sandworm to a Multiyear Hacking
Spree

The Russian military hackers known as Sandworm, responsible for everything from
blackouts in Ukraine to NotPetya, the most destructive malware in history, don't have a
reputation for discretion. But a French security agency now warns that hackers with tools and
techniques it links to Sandworm have stealthily hacked targets in that country by exploiting
an IT monitoring tool called Centreon‚Äîand appear to have gotten away with it undetected
for as long as three years.
On Monday, the French information security agency ANSSI published an advisory warning
that hackers with links to Sandworm, a group within Russia's GRU military intelligence
agency, had breached several French organizations. The agency describes those victims as
"mostly" IT firms and particularly web hosting companies. Remarkably, ANSSI says the
intrusion campaign dates back to late 2017 and continued until 2020. In those breaches, the
hackers appear to have compromised servers running Centreon, sold by the firm of the same
name based in Paris.

Though ANSSI says it hasn't been able to identify how those servers were hacked, it found
on them two different pieces of malware: one publicly available backdoor called PAS, and
another known as Exaramel, which Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET has spotted
Sandworm using in previous intrusions. While hacking groups do reuse each other's malware
‚Äîsometimes intentionally to mislead investigators‚Äîthe French agency also says it's seen
overlap in command and control servers used in the Centreon hacking campaign and
previous Sandworm hacking incidents.
Though it's far from clear what Sandworm's hackers might have intended in the years-long
French hacking campaign, any Sandworm intrusion raises alarms among those who have
seen the results of the group's past work. "Sandworm is linked with destructive ops," says
Joe Slowik, a researcher for security firm DomainTools who has tracked Sandworm's
activities for years, including an attack on the Ukrainian power grid where an early variant of
Sandworm's Exaramel backdoor appeared. "Even though there's no known endgame linked
to this campaign documented by the French authorities, the fact that it's taking place is
concerning, because the end goal of most Sandworm operations is to cause some
noticeable disruptive effect. We should be paying attention."
ANSSI didn't identify the victims of the hacking campaign. But a page of Centreon's website
lists customers including telecom providers Orange and OptiComm, IT consulting firm CGI,
defense and aerospace firm Thales, steel and mining firm ArcelorMittal, Airbus, Air France
KLM, logistics firm Kuehne + Nagel, nuclear power firm EDF, and the French Department of
Justice.
In an emailed statement Tuesday, however, a Centreon spokesperson wrote that no actual
Centreon customers were affected in the hacking campaign. Instead, the company says that
victims were using an open-source version of Centreon's software that the company hasn't
supported for more than five years, and argues that they were deployed insecurely, including
allowing connections from outside the organization's network. The statement also notes that
ANSSI has counted "only about 15" targets of the intrusions. "Centreon is currently
contacting all of its customers and partners to assist them in verifying their installations are
current and complying with ANSSI‚Äôs guidelines for a Healthy Information System," the
statement adds. "Centreon recommends that all users who still have an obsolete version of
its open source software in production update it to the latest version or contact Centreon and
its network of certified partners."
Some in the cybersecurity industry immediately interpreted the ANSSI report to suggest
another software supply chain attack of the kind carried out against SolarWinds. In a vast
hacking campaign revealed late last year, Russian hackers altered that firm's IT monitoring
application and it used to penetrate a still-unknown number of networks that includes at least
half a dozen US federal agencies.

But ANSSI's report doesn't mention a supply chain compromise, and Centreon writes in its
statement that "this is not a supply chain type attack and no parallel with other attacks of this
type can be made in this case." In fact, DomainTools' Slowik says the intrusions instead
appear to have been carried out simply by exploiting internet-facing servers running
Centreon's software inside the victims' networks. He points out that this would align with
another warning about Sandworm that the NSA published in May of last year: The
intelligence agency warned Sandworm was hacking internet-facing machines running the
Exim email client, which runs on Linux servers. Given that Centreon's software runs on
CentOS, which is also Linux-based, the two advisories point to similar behavior during the
same timeframe. "Both of these campaigns in parallel, during some of the same period of
time, were being used to identify externally facing, vulnerable servers that happened to be
running Linux for initial access or movement within victim networks," Slowik says. (In contrast
with Sandworm, which has been widely identified as part of the GRU, the SolarWinds attacks
have also yet to be definitively linked to any specific intelligence agency, though security
firms and the US intelligence community have attributed the hacking campaign to the
Russian government.)
Although Sandworm has focused many of its most notorious cyberattacks on Ukraine‚Äî
including the NotPetya worm that spread from Ukraine to cause $10 billion in damage
globally‚Äîthe GRU hasn't shied away from aggressively hacking French targets in the past.
In 2016, GRU hackers posing as Islamic extremists destroyed the network of France's TV5
television network, taking its 12 channels off the air. The next year, GRU hackers including
Sandworm carried out an email hack-and-leak operation intended to sabotage the
presidential campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron.
While no such disruptive effects appear to have resulted from the hacking campaign
described in ANSSI's report, the Centreon intrusions should serve as a warning, says John
Hultquist, the vice president of intelligence at security firm FireEye, whose team of
researchers first named Sandworm in 2014. He notes that FireEye has yet to attribute the
intrusions to Sandworm independently of ANSSI‚Äîbut also cautions that it's too early to say
that the campaign is over. "This could be intelligence collection, but Sandworm has a long
history of activity we have to consider," says Hultquist. "Any time we find Sandworm with
clear access over a long period of time, we need to brace for impact."
