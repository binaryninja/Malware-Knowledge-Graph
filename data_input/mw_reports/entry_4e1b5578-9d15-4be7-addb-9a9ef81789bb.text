Furtim is the latest stealthy malware,
found in the wild, and its discovery is
credited to @hFireF0X.
Clearly, Furtim’s developers were more
interested in keeping their malware
hidden from security’s prying eyes than
hitting more targets. With stealth a key
component, we code-named this
downloader Furtim, the Latin translation for “stealthy”.
At time of its nding, Furtim showed a 0% detection rate in VirusTotal, signifying that the
developers were awarded partial success in their attempt to remain hidden.
In our labs, we purposefully infected a computer to monitor Furtim’s activities on the device and
its communication with its Command & Control to understand its goals.

Furtim: The Ultra-Cautious Malware

What are Furtim’s components?
A driver. The driver tests the target’s machine environment – for example, the processes
that it runs and the security programs that are installed.
A downloader. The downloader is the malware component that opens up the backdoor
for the following installation of malicious modules of the malware, aka the “payloads”. You
can consider the downloader as the malware socket, a placeholder that sets everything in
place so that when the threat actor decides that the time is ripe, the payload simply plugs
into it.
Three payloads. We found three malicious modules: a power con guration change utility,
a stealer and a third le that communicates back to a server. Details on these appear
below.

What’s so unique about Furtim?
Furtim goes great lengths to ensure that it remains undercover. These measures show that
Furtim’s developers were very thorough in their activity, anticipating a campaign where they
can use Furtim throughout:
Prior to installation, Furtim checks whether the target machine includes any security
product, virtualized or sandboxed environment and foregoes installation if any is found.
In fact, Furtim tests the existence of these security parties against a monstrous-size list of
more than 400 items, from the obvious well-known products, to those on the verge of the
esoteric. While we have seen cases where downloaders and other malwares do not install
if other products are present, the list that Furtim tests against is beyond any typical
malware.
Furtim avoids DNS ltering services by scanning the network interfaces on the infected
machine. If it nds any of these services, it replaces any known ltering nameserver to
public nameservers o ered by Google and Level3 Communications.
Furtim blocks access to nearly 250 security related sites, such as AV update sites, by
replacing Windows' hosts le. The blocked sites list also includes technical help sites such
as BleepingComputer.com.
Once installed, the target’s device has to be re-booted in order for Furtim to properly latch
into the system. At that stage, Furtim ensures that any re-boot policy on a machine, even
those de ned by an administrator (aka “Group Policy”) is overridden so that downloaded
payloads will run.
On rst run, Furtim does a few con guration changes on its host system to block the user
from accessing the command line and task manager. These measures are taken to
prevent the possibility that these tools might reveal, or used to kill, the malicious
processes. In addition, Furtim disables Windows noti cation and pop-up mechanisms.
Upon initial communication, Furtim collects unique information from the device it is
running on, such as the computer name and installation date and sends that information
to a speci c server. The server stores the received details about the infected machine to
ensure that the payload is sent only once. In fact, even if the infected machine sends the

unique information from a di erent IP, the C&C server will know not to re-send this
payload and will return 404 error on any of these subsequent requests. We believe that
this is done to prevent security researchers and AV companies trying to collect the
samples from the server by repeating previous requests or running the sample multiple
times.

What are the payloads that Furtim
accepts?
We have witnessed the following three payloads though it is possible that Furtim was
developed to accept more than just these three.
1. Power saving con guration tool. The tool disables sleep mode and hibernation to ensure
that the system is always up and running unless manually shut down by a user. This way,
open communications with the C&C server is maintained.
2. A stealer, named Pony Stealer. Pony Stealer is a commercial credential stealer, considered
one of the more powerful stealers in the market today. As its name implies, this malicious
program steals saved credentials from various installed programs and sends them back
to a server where they are conveniently organized in a searchable web platform for easy
access. In practice, stealers are used to aid in lateral movement inside the organization.
3. A third unknown payload. This payload communicates back a list of certain discovered
processes to a Russian server. These processes of interest include virtualization
environments and security products. On the face of it, Furtim would not have installed
were these processes in place, however, this double check is done as a second
precautionary step. This third payload may very well include also the main malicious
functionality and persistence capabilities. Given its complexity, it will take a while to
completely understand that extent of its functionality. We will update its section, once
more details are revealed.

Who’s behind this attack?
Given the defense measures that Furtim takes, we can imagine that Furtim is more than a
downloader used by common fraudsters. The threat actors behind Furtim were dedicated,
knowing that it’s worth to remain stealthy, even on the expense of hitting more targets, than
being revealed.
We do know that the C&C server is hosted at a Russian domain, which resolves to several
Ukrainian IP addresses.
Additionally, communications are con gured to accept Russian.
With this in mind, it is easy to point a nger at Russia. However, we cannot jump to those
conclusions as threat actors typically hide their identity by masquerading as coming from a
certain location.

Furtim: The Ultra-Cautious Malware

Who is Furtim targeting?
This is one more question we don’t have the answer for. Nor do we know how the victim
becomes infected. We do know that this is an active malware as the server is live and kicking,
communicating with its instances.

How can you protect yourself against
Furtim and other such malware?
All evidence points that the threat actors behind Furtim are dedicated and will take the
necessary measures to slowly infect and remain stealthy. The dedicated threat actor has the
will and time to in ltrate. With this in mind, we need to recognize that in ltration is
inevitable, and address threat actors under the assumption that they already inside. This
approach requires cutting out in real-time the malicious communications so that once inside,
they cannot communicate outbound and in return, the consequences of the attack are
prevented.
