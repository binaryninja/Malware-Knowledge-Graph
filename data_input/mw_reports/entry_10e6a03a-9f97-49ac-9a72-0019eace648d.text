In the second half of 2017 Pawn Storm, an extremely active
espionage actor group, didn’t shy away from continuing their
brazen attacks. Usually, the group’s attacks are not isolated
incidents, and we can often relate them to earlier attacks by
carefully looking at both technical indicators and motives.
Pawn Storm has been attacking political organizations in
France, Germany, Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, and the
United States since 2015. We saw attacks against political
organizations again in the second half of 2017. These
attacks don’t show much technical innovation over time, but
they are well prepared, persistent, and often hard to defend against. Pawn Storm has a large
toolset full of social engineering tricks, malware and exploits, and therefore doesn’t need much
innovation apart from occasionally using their own zero-days and quickly abusing software
vulnerabilities shortly after a security patch is released.
In summer and fall of 2017, we observed Pawn Storm targeting several organizations with
credential phishing and spear phishing attacks. Pawn Storm’s modus operandi is quite
consistent over the years, with some of their technical tricks being used repeatedly. For
example, tabnabbing was used against Yahoo! users in August and September 2017 in US
politically themed email. The method, which we first discussed in 2014, involves changing a
browser tab to point to a phishing site after distracting the target.
We can often closely relate current and old Pawn Storm campaigns using data that spans
more than four years, possibly because the actors in the group follow a script when setting up
an attack. This makes sense, as the sheer volume of their attacks requires careful
administration, planning, and organization to succeed. The screenshots below show two
typical credential phishing emails that targeted specific organizations in October and November
2017. One type of email is supposedly a message from the target’s Microsoft Exchange server
about an expired password. The other says there is a new file on the company’s OneDrive
system.

2017. The logo of the target organization has been removed from the screenshot and the color
was changed as not to reveal the source.

While these emails might not seem to be advanced in nature, we’ve seen that credential loss
is often the starting point of further attacks that include stealing sensitive data from email
inboxes. We have worked with one of the targets, an NGO in the Netherlands targeted twice,
in late October and early November 2017. We successfully prevented both attacks from
causing any harm. In one case we were able to warn the target within two hours after a
dedicated credential phishing site was set up. In an earlier attack, we were able to warn the
organization 24 hours before the actual phishing emails were sent.
Olympic Wintersports Federations
We have seen several International Olympic Wintersport Federations, such as the European
Ice Hockey Federation, the International Ski Federation, the International Biathlon Union, the
International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation, among
the group’s targets in the second half of 2017. This is noteworthy due to the timing correlation
between several Russian Olympic players being banned for life in fall, 2017. In 2016, Pawn
Storm had some success in compromising WADA (the World Anti-Doping Agency) and TASCAS (the Court of Arbitration for Sport). At that time, Pawn Storm sought active contact with
mainstream media either directly or via proxies and had influence on what some of them
published.
Political targets
In the week of the 2017 presidential elections in Iran, Pawn Storm set up a phishing site
targeting chmail.ir webmail users. We were able to collect evidence that credential phishing
emails were sent to chmail.ir users on May 18, 2017, just one day before the presidential
elections in Iran. We have previously reported similar targeted activity against political
organizations in France, Germany, Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States.
Beginning in June 2017, phishing sites were set up mimicking the ADFS (Active Directory
Federation Services) of the U.S. Senate. By looking at the digital fingerprints of these phishing
sites and comparing them with a large data set that spans almost five years, we can uniquely
relate them to a couple of Pawn Storm incidents in 2016 and 2017. The real ADFS server of
the U.S. Senate is not reachable on the open internet, however phishing of users’ credentials
on an ADFS server that is behind a firewall still makes sense. In case an actor already has a
foothold in an organization after compromising one user account, credential phishing could
help him get closer to high profile users of interest.
The future of politically motivated campaigns
Rogue political influence campaigns are not likely to go away in the near future. Political
organizations have to be able to communicate openly with their voters, the press and the
general public. This makes them vulnerable to hacking and spear phishing. On top of that, it’s
also relatively easy to influence public opinion via social media. Social media platforms
continue to form a substantial part of users’ online experience, and they let advertisers reach
consumers with their message.

This makes social media algorithms susceptible to abuse by various actors with bad intentions.
Publishing stolen data together with spreading fake news and rumors on social media gives
malicious actors powerful tools. While a successful influence campaign might seem relatively
easy to do, it needs a lot of planning, persistence, and resources to be successful. Some of
the basic tools and services, like ones used to spread fake news on social media, are already
being offered as a service in the underground economy.
As we have mentioned in our overview paper on Pawn Storm, other actors may also start their
own campaigns that aim to influence politics and issues of interest domestically and abroad.
Actors from developing countries will learn and probably adapt similar methods quickly in the
near future. In 2016, we published a report on C Major, an espionage group that primarily
targets the Indian military. By digging deeper into C Major’s activities, we found that this actor
group not only attacks the Indian military, but also has dedicated botnets for compromised
targets in Iranian universities, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Recently, we have witnessed C
Major also showing some interest in compromising military and diplomatic targets in the West.
It is only a matter of time before actors like C Major begin attempting to influence public
opinion in foreign countries, as well.
With the Olympics and several significant global elections taking place in 2018, we can be sure
Pawn Storm’s activities will continue. We at Trend Micro will keep monitoring their targeted
activities, as well as activities of similar actors, as cyberpropaganda and digital extortion
remain in use.
