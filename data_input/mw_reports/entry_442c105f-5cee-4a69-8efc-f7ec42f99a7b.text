Exploring the QBOT Attack Pattern

Docker
We can easily run the extractor with Docker, first we need to build the image:
docker build . -t qbot-config-extractor

Then we run the container with the -v flag to map a host directory to the docker container
directory:
docker run -ti --rm -v \
"$(pwd)/data":/data qbot-config-extractor:latest -d /data/

We can either specify a single sample with -f option or a directory of samples with -d.
$ docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data qbot-config-extractor:latest -f

Running it Locally
As mentioned above, Docker is the recommended approach to running this project,
however you can also run this locally. This project uses Poetry to manage dependencies,
testing, and metadata. If you have Poetry installed already, from this directory, you can

simply run the following commands to run the tool. This will setup a virtual environment,
install the dependencies, activate the virtual environment, and run the console script.
poetry lock
poetry install
poetry shell
qbot-config-extractor -h

Once that works, you can do the same sort of things as mentioned in the Docker
instructions above.
