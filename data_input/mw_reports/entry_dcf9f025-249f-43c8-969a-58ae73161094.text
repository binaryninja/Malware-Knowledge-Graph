We found new campaigns that appear to wear the badge of
MuddyWater. Analysis of these campaigns revealed the use of new
tools and payloads, which indicates that the well-known threat actor
group is continuously developing their schemes. We also unearthed
and detailed our other findings on MuddyWater, such as its
connection to four Android malware families and its use of false flag
techniques, among others, in our report “New MuddyWater
Activities Uncovered: Threat Actors Used Multi-Stage Backdoors,
False Flags, Android Malware, and More.”
One of the campaigns sent spear-phishing emails to a university in Jordan and the Turkish
government. The said legitimate entities’ sender addresses were not spoofed to deceive email
recipients. Instead, the campaign used compromised legitimate accounts to trick victims into installing
malware.

Security Predictions for 2019

Our security predictions for 2019 are based on
our experts’ analysis of the progress of current
and emerging technologies, user behavior, and
market trends, and their impact on the threat
landscape. We have categorized them
according to the main areas that are likely to be
affected, given the sprawling nature of the
technological and sociopolitical changes under
consideration.

Attackers are starting to invest in long-term
operations that target specific processes
enterprises rely on. They scout for vulnerable
practices, susceptible systems and operational
loopholes that they can leverage or abuse. To

Figure 2. Email headers showing the origin of the spear-phishing email
Our analysis revealed that the threat actor group deployed a new multi-stage PowerShell-based
backdoor called POWERSTATS v3. The spear-phishing email that contains a document embedded
with a malicious macro drops a VBE file encoded with Microsoft Script Encoder. The VBE file, which
holds a base64-encoded block of data containing obfuscated PowerShell script, will then execute. This
block of data will be decoded and saved to the %PUBLIC% directory under various names ending with
image file extensions such as .jpeg and .png. The PowerShell code will then use custom string

The final backdoor code is revealed after the deobfuscation of all strings and removal of all
unnecessary code. But first, the backdoor will acquire the operating system (OS) information and save
the result to a log file.

This file will be uploaded to the command and control (C&C) server. Each victim machine will generate
a random GUID number, which will be used for machine identification. Later on, the malware variant will
start the endless loop, querying for the GUID-named file in a certain folder on the C&C server. If such a
file is found, it will be downloaded and executed using the Powershell.exe process.
A second stage attack can be launched by commands sent to a specific victim in an asynchronous
way, e.g., another backdoor payload can be downloaded and installed to targets that they are interested
in.

Figure 5. The code in POWERSTATS v3 which downloads the second attack stage
We were able to analyze a case where the group launched a second stage attack. The group was able
to download another backdoor, which is supported by the following commands:
Take screenshots
Command execution via the cmd.exe binary
If there’s no keyword, the malware variant assumes that the input is PowerShell code and
executes it via the “Invoke-Expression” cmdlet

Figure 6. The code in POWERSTATS v3 (second stage) that handles the screenshot command
The C&C communication is done using PHP scripts with a hardcoded token and a set of backend
functions such as sc (screenshot), res (result of executed command), reg (register new victim), and
uDel (self-delete after an error).

Figure 7. In an endless loop, the malware variant queries a given path on the C&C server, trying to
download a GUID-named file with commands to execute.
Other MuddyWater campaigns in the first half of 2019
The MuddyWater threat actor group has been actively targeting victims with a variety of tricks, and they
seem to keep on adding more as they move forward with new campaigns. The campaign that used
POWERSTATS v3 is not the only one we found with new tricks. We observed other campaigns that
changed their delivery methods and dropped file types. Notably, these campaigns have also changed
payloads and publicly available post-exploitation tools.

Table 1. MuddyWater’s delivery methods and payloads in 2019 1H
In January 2019, we discovered that the campaign started using SHARPSTATS, a .NET-written
backdoor that supports DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD, and RUN functions. In the same month,
DELPHSTATS, a backdoor written in the Delphi programming language, emerged. DELPHSTATS
queries the C&C server for a .dat file before executing it via the Powershell.exe process. Like
SHARPSTATS, DELPHSTATS employs custom PowerShell script with code similarities to the one
embedded into the former.

Figure 8. SHARPSTATS can be used to collect system information by dropping and executing a
PowerShell script.

Figure 9. The code in DELPHSTATS that queries a certain directory on the C&C server. It’s where
operators upload additional payload.
We came across the heavily obfuscated POWERSTATS v2 in March 2019. An earlier version of this
backdoor decodes the initial encoded/compressed blocks of code, while an improved version appeared
later on. The latter heavily uses format strings and redundant backtick characters. The function names
in the earlier version were still somehow readable, but they were completely randomized in later
versions.

Figure 10. Obfuscated POWERSTATS v2
After deobfuscation, the main backdoor loop queries different URLs for a “Hello server” message to
obtain command and upload the result of the run command to the C&C server.

Use of different post-exploitation tools
We also observed MuddyWater’s use of multiple open source post-exploitation tools, which they
deployed after successfully compromising a target.

Table 2. Tools used by MuddyWater campaigns over the years.
The delivery of the EmpireProject stager is notable in one of the campaigns that we monitored. The
scheme involves the use of template injection and the abuse of the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. If
the email recipient clicks on a malicious document, a remote template is downloaded, which will trigger
the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882. This will then lead to the execution the EmpireProject stager.

Figure 12. Clicking on the malicious document leads to the abuse of CVE-2017-11882 and the
execution of the EmpireProject stager.
Another campaign also stands out for its use of the LaZagne credential dumper, which was patched to
drop and run POWERSTATS in the main function.

Figure 13. LaZagne has been patched to drop and run POWERSTATS in the main function. See added
intimoddumpers() function. Note the typo in the function name – its INTI, not INIT.
Conclusion and security recommendations
While MuddyWater appears to have no access to zero-days and advanced malware variants, it still
managed to compromise its targets. This can be attributed to the constant development of their
schemes.
Notably, the group’s use of email as an infection vector seems to yield success for their campaigns. In
this regard, apart from using smart email security solutions, organizations should inform their
employees of ways to stay safe from email threats.
Organizations can also take advantage of Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™, a solution that provides

detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive response to today’s stealthy malware and targeted attacks in
real time. It provides a comprehensive defense tailored to protect organizations against targeted
attacks and advanced threats through specialized engines, custom sandboxing, and seamless
