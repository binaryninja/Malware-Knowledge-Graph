Player 1 Limps Back Into the Ring - Hello again, Locky!
blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/necurs-locky-campaign.html

Back in May, the Necurs spam botnet jettisoned Locky ransomware in favor of the new Jaff
ransomware variant. However, earlier this month Kaspersky discovered a vulnerability within
Jaff which allowed them to create a decryptor. This turn of events seems to have caused the
miscreants behind Necurs to scramble to distribute a different ransomware payload. Falling
back on their old tricks, they have selected to re-distribute Locky ransomware. The malware
is being transmitted via email using an .exe file encapsulated within two compressed .zip
archives.

The Spam Campaign
The spam that is distributing this ransomware campaign is not significantly different from
other ransomware spam campaigns that we have seen from Necurs. Ransomware-oriented
spam campaigns from Necurs typically involve order confirmations, payment receipts,
business documents, and so on -- all with the common goal of social engineering victims into
opening the attachment. The messages Talos observed in this particular campaign are
disguised as fake invoices.

The volume of Locky spam Necurs has sent since the start of this particular campaign is
notable. In the first hour of this campaign, Talos observed that Locky spam accounted for up
to 7.2% of email volume on one of our systems. While the campaign has since decreased in
the number of messages being sent per minute, Necurs is still actively sending messages
containing Locky, though only in small quantities.

Locky's Metamorphosis
Although they are using the same affiliate ID, for this particular round of Locky, the attackers
have altered their ransomware. We were unable to get the ransomware to encrypt data on
any systems running an operating system more recent than Windows XP. Upon further
investigation, we determined that on systems running Windows 7 or later with Data
Execution Prevention (DEP) would cause the unpacker to fail. Our analysis suggests that
Locky has now added anti-debugging protection to their configuration. Instead of unpacking
the configuration, when a debugger is detected their config pointer is directed at
kernel32!AllocConsole, frustrating any attempts at analysis. In response to this new antianalysis technique, Talos has updated LockyDump so that it is able to extract the
configuration information from this latest iteration.

than Windows XP.

Another notable aspect of this latest campaign was the C2 URL structure. Adversaries
behind this latest Locky campaign have reused the /checkupdate path as part of the URL
structure -- the same URL structure found in previous Locky campaigns. This is perhaps

3/6

another indication that adversaries were hasty in their developing and distributing this
campaign.

Conclusion
This updated version of Locky appears to have been hastily deployed, and as a result it has
not affected users running Windows operating systems other than Windows XP. The
attackers behind this ransomware are likely already aware of this, so we can expect a fixed
version of Locky to appear in a future round of Necurs' ransomware spam.
Despite sounding like a broken record, we at Talos feel it's our duty to re-iterate that it's
always risky clicking on links or opening attachments in strange email messages. Users that
fail to heed this advice can easily become ransomware victims, and if the subsequent
ransom is paid, the monies will no doubt fund another round of attacks. As always,
organizations are encouraged to make regular backups of their data, practice restoring said
data, and store your backups offline far out of the reach of potential criminals.
