The Spelevo exploit kit has been spotted by security researchers while infecting victims with
Maze Ransomware payloads via a new malicious campaign that exploits a Flash Player use
after free vulnerability.
Maze Ransomware, a variant of Chacha Ransomware, was initially found by Malwarebytes
security researcher Jérôme Segura in May.
The researcher found that the ransomware was being distributed using the Fallout exploit
kit via a fake site camouflaged as a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange app.
Segura told BleepingComputer that the attackers created a fake Abra cryptocurrency site to
buy ad network traffic which was later used to redirect visitors to the exploit kit landing page
under certain conditions.

New Maze Ransomware campaign
Exploit kit expert nao_sec was the first to spot the new Maze Ransomware campaign
yesterday, with GrujaRS also taking a closer look at it one hour later.

This campaign is redirecting users to the Spelevo exploit kit, as shown in the web requests
captured by nao_sec and as shown in the screenshot below.
When redirected to the exploit, Spelevo will attempt to exploit the critical CVE-2018-15982
use after free vulnerability in the browser, with users of Flash Player versions 31.0.0.153 /
31.0.0.108 and earlier being the ones exposed.
Upon successful exploitation, the exploit kit will automatically download and install the Maze
Ransomware payload via arbitrary code execution.
Spelevo was previously seen by Cisco Talos while dropping the infamous IceD and Dridex
banking trojans via a compromised business-to-business (B2B) website.

Spelevo exploit kit in action

The Maze Ransomware
When the Maze Ransomware payload is installed and executed, it will start scanning for
interesting files (e.g., documents, photos, databases, and more) to encrypt them using RSA
encryption and the ChaCha20 stream cipher, and append several extensions as shown
below.

The ransomware will also create a ransom note named DECRYPT-FILES.txt in each of the
scanned folders, instructing the victims to open a website hosted on the TOR network for
payment instructions to purchase a private key to decrypt the files.
Victims are also provided with an online decryption interface which allows them to decrypt
three of their now locked files as proof that decryption is indeed possible.
According to the ransomware's support site, the ransom value automatically doubles if the
victim does not pay within approximately a week after the ransom note was uploaded.
A second website available over the clear web is also provided, with the mention that it
might be blocked in some countries and thus leaving the TOR site as the only option.

Ransom note(Image: GrujaRS)
On this support website, the victims will be asked to upload their ransom note to get further
instructions on how to recover their data.
Once the attackers' parser recognizes the ransom note, the victims will be redirected to a
page where they can test the attackers' decryption tool (supports only BMP, JPG, GIF, and
PNG image files) and get info on how to buy Bitcoins to pay the ransom.
The Maze Ransomware 'support' site also comes with a live support chat as detailed in the
ransom note and as GrujaRS also found.
He created a video to demo the attack, to show how Maze Ransomware encrypts its
victims' files, how the live chat works, and to take a look at the Maze Ransomware test
decrypt tool.

At this time, there is no way to decrypt for free the files that Maze Ransomware encrypts.If
anything changes, we will publish a new article with additional findings.

How to protect yourself from Maze Ransomware
To protect yourself from Maze Ransomware, or from any other ransomware family, it is
important to use good computing habits and security software. The most important thing is
to always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that you can quickly restore in
case of an emergency, like a ransomware attack.
Since Maze is being dropped via exploit kits, you need to make sure that all the latest
Windows security updates are installed and that all your software is up to date. By doing
this you will prevent exploit kits from abusing previously patched vulnerabilities to infect
your computer.
Given that ransomware is also known to be delivered via hacked Remote Desktop services,
you should make sure that computers running remote desktop services in your network are
not directly connected to the Internet by placing them behind VPNs to only allow access to
trusted users.
Running security software with a built-in behavioral detection engine like Emsisoft AntiMalware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is also important when defending your data
against ransomware infections.

5/7

Last, but not least, you also need to follow good online security habits, since, in many
cases, are the most important measures of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make
sure you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older
programs contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware
distributors. Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.
If you are using Remote Desktop Services, do not connect it directly to the Internet.
Instead make it accessibly only via a VPN.
