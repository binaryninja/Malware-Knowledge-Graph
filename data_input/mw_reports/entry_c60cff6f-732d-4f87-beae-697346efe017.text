New in Ransomware: AlumniLocker, Humble Feature Different Extortion Techniques

March 4, 2021

We recently discovered two new ransomware variants, AlumniLocker and Humble, which exhibit different sophisticated behaviors and
extortion techniques post-encryption.
One of these techniques includes an unusually high ransom payment and a threat to publicize victims’ critical data. These new variants
prove that ransomware’s targeted and extortion-focused era is alive and well in 2021.

Technical analyses
AlumniLocker ransomware
We recently spotted the AlumniLocker ransomware, a variant of the Thanos ransomware family, which asks for a ransom payment of 10
bitcoins (equivalent to US$457,382.60 as of writing). The ransomware actors also threaten to publish their victims’ data on their “wall of
shame” website if they don’t send the payment within 48 hours.
AlumniLocker arrives via a malicious PDF email attachment. Based on our investigation, the PDF is a fake invoice that urges the victim
to download it.

The malicious PDF contains a link (hxxps://femto[.]pw/cyp5) that, once clicked, will download a ZIP archive containing a downloader.

The ZIP archive also contains a fake JPG file, which is actually a PowerShell script that will download and execute the AlumniLocker
payload by abusing a Background Intelligent Service Transfer (BITS) module.

The AlumniLocker ransomware file is a Themida-packed Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) executable file. It appends .alumni to
encrypted files:

Once AlumniLocker encrypts a victim’s files, a text file that details the amount of ransom demanded by the actors, as well as
instructions on how to send over the payment, is shown via Notepad. If the ransom amount is not paid within the specified period, the
ransomware actors threaten to publish the victim’s personal files on their website, which is inaccessible as of writing.

Humble ransomware
We spotted the Humble ransomware in February 2021. This not-so-typical ransomware family is compiled with an executable wrapper
(Bat2Exe). Our investigation points to two Humble ransomware variants, both with extortion techniques that prompt victims to pay
ransom expeditiously. One variant threatens a victim that once they restart their system, the Master Boot Record (MBR) will be
rewritten. Meanwhile, the other variant makes the same threat about the MBR being rewritten if the victim does not pay the ransom
within five days.
The main executable is the batch file itself — something that might be uncommon but not new. What sets this ransomware apart from
others is its utilization of a public webhook service from communication platform Discord to report to its author or publish infection
reports from its victims.
The Humble ransomware denies explorer.exe from viewing or accessing local storage drives.

The first Humble ransomware variant we analyzed drops the %temp%\{temp directory}\extd.exe component, which is usually used for
cryptography and web API binary, to aid with file encryption.
The malware utilizes certutil.exe, a program that manages Windows certificates, to generate a key from a randomized input. This will
then be used by the extd.exe component to encrypt files.

input.
Humble ransomware encrypts 104 file types, including files with the following extensions: .exe, .pdf, .mp3, .jpeg, .cc, .java, and .sys.
After a machine is successfully encrypted, the malware sends a report to the ransomware operator’s Discord webhook panel via a
custom-made AutoIt-compiled Discord webhook binary.

and encryption
The malware will generate a random string that will then be used to append the infected files. The malware also displays a ransom note
that is set as a user’s lock-screen image, warning the victim against restarting the system.

The second Humble ransomware variant that we analyzed downloads the component file (detected by Trend Micro as
Boot.Win32.KILLMBR.AD) using PowerShell, certutil.exe, and extd.exe, instead of being encoded within and being automatically
dropped from the batch file.

This variant informs the victim of the infected machine that if they do not pay the ransom of 0.0002 bitcoins (US$9.79 as of writing)
within five days, all files will be deleted.

Security recommendations and Trend Micro solutions
As ransomware families and variants evolve, they become more deliberate with their approaches and employ the use of complex
techniques and behaviors with the goal of successfully siphoning off millions in ransomware payments. According to the insurance
company Coalition, cyberextortion amounts doubled from 2019 to the first quarter of 2020.
Users and organizations should follow important security recommendations in order to keep their devices and systems protected from
ransomware, including enforcing the principle of least privilege, disabling local admin accounts, and limiting access to shared or network
drives.
The following are other vital recommendations for users and organizations to prevent ransomware attacks:
Unverified emails and links embedded in them should be opened with caution, as ransomware has been known to spread in this
manner.
Important files should be backed up using the 3-2-1 rule: Create three backup copies on two different media with one backup in a
separate location.
Regularly update software, programs, and applications to protect them from the latest vulnerabilities.
Keep personal information safe, as even this could give out clues to security information on used systems.

How can Trend Micro protect organizations from ransomware?
Trend Micro’s comprehensive XDR solution applies the most effective expert analytics to the deep data sets collected from Trend Micro
solutions across the enterprise, making faster connections to identify and stop attacks. Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) and expert
security analytics correlate data from customer environments and Trend Micro’s global threat intelligence to deliver fewer, higher-fidelity
alerts, leading to better, early detection. One console with one source of prioritized, optimized alerts supported with guided investigation
simplifies the steps to achieving a full understanding of the attack path and impact on the organization.
The Trend Micro Apex One™ solution offers threat detection, response, and investigation within a single agent. Automated threat
detection and response provide protection from an ever-growing variety of threats, including fileless and ransomware. An advanced
endpoint detection and response (EDR) toolset, strong security information and event management (SIEM) integration, and an open
API set provide actionable insights, expanded investigative capabilities, and centralized visibility across the network.
Trend Micro Cloud One™– Workload Security has a virtual patching feature that can protect the system from exploits. Since some of
the malware’s techniques can bypass signature-based security agents, technologies like Trend Micro Behavior Monitoring and Machine
Learning can be used to prevent and block those threats.
