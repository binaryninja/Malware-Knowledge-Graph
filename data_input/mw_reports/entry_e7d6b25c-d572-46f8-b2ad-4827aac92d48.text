Trojanized OneNote Document Leads to Formbook
Malware
trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/trojanized-onenote-document-leads-to-formbook-malware/

Cybercriminals have long used Microsoft documents to pass along malware and they are
always experimenting with new ways to deliver malicious packages. As defenders,
Trustwave SpiderLabs’ researchers are always looking out for new or unusual file types,
and through this ongoing research, we uncovered threat actors using a OneNote document
to move Formbook malware, an information stealing trojan sold on an underground hacking
forum since mid-2016 as malware-as-a-service. Formbook malware can steal data from
various web browsers and from other applications. This malware also has keylogging
functionality and can take screenshots.
One file type that caught our eye on December 6, 2022, was the aforementioned OneNote
attachment, with a .one extension attached to a spam email in our telemetry system. It’s not
typical to email .one files, so we took a closer look at the email, which is shown below.

Once the OneNote attachment is opened, an image lure is displayed. When the user clicks
on the ‘View Document’ part of the image, a security warning appears.

Figure 2: The

attached OneNote file pdf172.one
As shown in Figure 1, MailMarshal’s engine recognized and unpacked the contents of
pdf172.one. One of the unpacked components is a Windows Script File (WSF), which is
overlaid on the ‘View Document’ part of the image. When a user clicks on the 'View
Document" part of the image, this causes the WSF file to be executed, and triggers a
standard security alert that a file is being opened from the OneNote application.
Also, it is interesting that the filename of the WSF itself has some deception, likely an
attempt to fool scanners. The filename contains a right-to-left override character (U+202E)
after 'invoice', which causes the text that follows to be displayed in reverse. So, instead of
displaying 'docx.wsf' some applications may display 'fsw.xcoD'.
When a user clicks on the 'View Document" part of the image, this causes the WSF file to
be executed, and triggers a standard security alert that a file is being opened from the
OneNote application.

When the user goes against the warning and clicks ‘OK,’ the malicious behavior of the file
will start to manifest. The WSF embedded in the OneNote file launches ‘PowerShell’
commands to download and execute two files from a0745450[.]xsph[.]ru.

contained on the OneNote attachment
The first file to be retrieved is a decoy OneNote file. This will be downloaded from
a0745450[.]xsph[.]ru/INVESTEMENT[.]one and saved as %temp%\invoice.one. The decoy
file will be launched first to hide the downloading of the second file, which contains the
payload.
The second file is an executable which will be downloaded from
a0745450[.]xsph[.]ru/DT6832.exe and saved as %temp%\system32.exe. This executable is
the Formbook malware, an information stealing trojan sold on an underground hacking
forum since mid-2016 as malware-as-a-service. Formbook malware can steal data from
various web browsers and from other applications. This malware also has keylogging
functionality and can take screenshots.
In sum, a WSF file embedded in a OneNote document is likely to fly under the radar. It also
means that OneNote can now join the list of other Office Documents that need to be
inspected for malicious components. As mentioned earlier, it’s not typical to see .one files

attached to emails. As a mitigation step, organizations should consider blocking or flagging
inbound email attachments with a .one extension.
For Trustwave MailMarshal customers: Upon detecting this threat, the Trustwave
SpiderLabs’ MailMarshal Team released extra heuristics for characteristics of the .one
malicious attachment.
