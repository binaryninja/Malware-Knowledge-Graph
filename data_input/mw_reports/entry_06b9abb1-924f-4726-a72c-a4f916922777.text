Among the 48 subgroups of SectorB, hacking groups that showed most activities in 2021
was SectorB22 group, followed by SectorB01 group, SectorB03 and SectorB35 groups.
The following figure is the map of targeted countries of SectorB groups in 2021. A darker
shade of red represents a higher number of attacks.

[Figure 2 : Map of mainly targeted countries by SectorB groups in 2021]

From the results, it could be deduced that SectorB carried out the greatest number of
hacking activities targeted on Hong Kong, a neighboring country of China, followed by the
United States and Russia.
Hong Kong has been independent of China in terms of political and economic fields, but
recently, democracy movements have emerged in the country against introduction of China’s
socialist political system. With regards to this, some of the hacking groups supported by the
Chinese government launched hacking activities targeted on Hong Kong’s liberalist
personnel for surveillance purposes.
Additionally, China launched hacking attacks on Russian research institutions with the
purpose of stealing advanced science technologies related to latest military technologies
such as aircraft carriers and jet planes.
