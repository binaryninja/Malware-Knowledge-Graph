Nowadays Iran’s Cybersecurity capabilities are under microscope, many news sites, gov.
agencies and security experts warn about a possible cybersecurity infiltration from Iranian
government and alert to increase cybersecurity defensive levels. Today I want to share a
quick and short study based on cross correlation between MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia
about some of the main threat actors attributed to Iran. The Following sections describe the
TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) used by some of the most influential Iranian APT
groups. Each section comes with a main graph which is built by scripting and which comes
without legend, so please keep in mind while reading that: the red circles represent the
analyzed threat actors, the green circles represent threat actor’s used techniques, the blue
circles represent the threat actor’s used Malware and the black circles represent the threat
actor’s used tool sets.

OilRig

1/8

According to Malpedia: “OilRig is an Iranian threat group operating primarily in the Middle
East by targeting organizations in this region that are in a variety of different industries;
however, this group has occasionally targeted organizations outside of the Middle East as
well. It also appears OilRig carries out supply chain attacks, where the threat group
leverages the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets.” The
threat actor uses opensource tools such as Mimikatz and laZagne, common sysadmin
toolset available on Microsoft distribution or sysinternals such as: PsExec, CertUtil, Netstat,
SystemInfo, ipconfig and tasklist. Bonupdater, Helminth, Quadangent and PowRuner are
some of the most sophisticated Malware attributed to OilRig and analyzed over the past few
years. Techniques (green) are mainly focused in the lateral movements and in getting
persistence on the victim infrastructure; few of them involved exploiting or 0days initiatives.

OilRig TTP
Those observations would suggest a powerful group mostly focused on staying hidden rather
than getting access through advanced techniques. Indeed no 0days or usage of advanced
exploits is found over the target infrastructure. If so we are facing a state-sponsored group
with high capabilities in developing persistence and hidden communication channels (for
example over DNS) but without a deep interest in exploiting services. This topic would rise a
question: OilRig does not need advanced exploiting capabilities because it is such a simple
way to get into a victim infrastructure ? For example by using: user credential leaks, social
engineering toolkits, targeted phishing, and so on and so forth or is more on there to be
discovered ?
2/8

MuddyWater
According to MITRE: “MuddyWater is an Iranian threat group that has primarily targeted
Middle Eastern nations, and has also targeted European and North American nations. The
group’s victims are mainly in the telecommunications, government (IT services), and oil
sectors.” Currently we have few artifacts related to MuddyWater (‘Muddy’), indeed only
Powerstats backdoor is actually attributed to it. Their attack are typically “hands driven”,
which means they do not use automation lateral movement but they prefer to use
opensource tools or sysinternal ones to deliberately move between target network rather
than running massively exploits or scanners.

MuddyWater TTP
Once landed inside a victim machine Muddy looks for local credentials and then moves back
and forward by using such a credentials directly on the network/domain controllers.
According to MITRE techniques (green) MuddyWater to take an entire target-network might
take few months but the accesses are quite silent and well obfuscated. Again it looks like we
are facing a group which doesn’t need advanced exploitation activities but rather than
advanced IT knowledge in order to move between network segments and eventual
proxies/nat.

APT33
3/8

According to MITRE: “APT33 is a suspected Iranian threat group that has carried out
operations since at least 2013. The group has targeted organizations across multiple
industries in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, with a particular interest in
the aviation and energy sectors.” Analyzing the observed TTPs we might agree that this
threat actor looks very close to MuddyWater. If you take a closer look to the Muddy Graph (in
the previous dedicated section) and APT33 graph (following) you will see many similarities:
many tools are shared, many techniques are shared and even artifacts Powerstats (Muddy)
and Powertron (APT33) share functions and a small subset of code (even if they have
different code bases and differ in functionalities). We have more information about APT33 if
compared to MuddyWatter, but similarities on TTPs could induce an avid reader to think that
we might consider APT33 as the main threat actor while MuddyWater a specific ‘operation’ of
the APT33 actor.

APT33 TTP
But if you wonder why I decided to keep them separated on such personal and preliminary
analysis you could find the answer in the reason in why they do attack. APT33 showed
destruction intents by using Malware such as shamoon and stoneDrill, while Muddy mostly
wants to “backdooring” the victims.

CopyKittens

4/8

According to MITRE: “CopyKittens is an Iranian cyber espionage group that has been
operating since at least 2013. It has targeted countries including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey,
the U.S., Jordan, and Germany. The group is responsible for the campaign known as
Operation Wilted Tulip.” CopyKittens threat actor actually differ from the previous ones. First
of all we see the usage of CobaltStrike, which is an autonomous exploiting system (well
actually is much more, but let me simplify it). Cobalt and Empire (a post exploitation
framework) taken together would allow the attacker to automate lateral movement. Which is
a damn different behavior respect to previous actors. CopyKittens would make much more
noise inside an attacked network and would be easier to detect if using such automation
tools, but on the other hand they would be much more quick in reaching their targets and run
away.

CopyKittens TTP
One more characteristic is the “code signing”. While in OilRig, MuddyWater and APT33 we
mostly observed “scripting” capabilities, in CopyKittens we are observing most advanced
code capabilities. Indeed code signing is used on Microsoft Windows and IOS to guarantee
that the software comes from known developer and that it has not been tampered with. While
a script (node, python, AutoIt) could be attribute to IT guys as well as developers, developing
more robust and complex software ( such as: java, .net, c++, etc) is a skill typically attributed
to developers. This difference could be significant in suspecting a small set of different
people working on CopyKittens.
5/8

Cleaver
According to MITRE: “Cleaver is a threat group that has been attributed to Iranian actors and
is responsible for activity tracked as Operation Cleaver. [1] Strong circumstantial evidence
suggests Cleaver is linked to Threat Group 2889 (TG-2889). ” We have few information
about this group, and as you might see there are few similarities. The usage of Mimikatz
could be easily adopted for credential dumping, while TinyZBot is a quite interesting tool
since it mostly implements spying capabilities without strong architectural design or code
execution or data exfiltration.

Cleaver TTP
Just like Charming Kitten (which is not included into this report since it is a quite ongoing
mistery even if a great report from Clear Sky is available), Cleaver is a threat group that is
responsible of one of the first most advanced and silent cyber attack attributed to Iran known
until now (OpCleaver, by Cylance). Cleaver attack capabilities are evolved over time very
quickly and, according to Cylance, active since 2012. They look like to have infiltrated some
of the world economic powers (ref: here) such as: Canada, China, England, France,
Germany, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey,
United Arab Emirates, and the United States. In the very first page of the OpCleaver report,
the author writes that Cleaver is one of the most advanced threat actors ever. Even if I might
agree with Cylance, I personally do not have such evidences so far, so I personally cannot
compare Cleaver threat actor to the previus ones.

Threat Actors Comparison
Here comes the fun ! How about taking all these graphs and compare them ? Common
references would highlight similarities, scopes and common TTPs and fortunately we might
appreciate them in the following unique network diagram. You might spend over 20 minutes
to check details on the following graph and I might decide to write an essay over it, but I will
not do it :D, I’d like focus on few but important thoughts.
The iper-connection between the analyzed groups (take a look to the following graph)
could prove that those teams are really linked together. They share Techniques, Procedures,
Tools and Infection Artifacts and everything we might observe looks like belonging with a
unique meta-actor. We might agree that the meta-actor would be linked to the sponsorship
nation and we might decide to consider some of those groups as operations. In other words
we might consider an unique group of people that teams up depending of the ongoing
operation adopting similar capabilities and tool sets.

Threat Actor Comparison
OilRig and APT33 are the most known groups attributed to Iran, they share many tools but
they clearly have two different intent and two different code bases (writing about Malware).
CopyKittens, for example, have been clustered more closed to APT33 while Muddywater
looks like clustered straight at the middle of them. But if we closely analyze the purposes and
7/8

the used Malware we might agree in aggregating Muddy close to APT33, actually the weight
of shared code should be heavier compared to common tools or common techniques, but I
did not represent such a detail into graphs.
However two different ‘code experience’ are observed. The first one mostly focused on
scriptting (node, python, autoIT) which could underline a group of people evolving from IT
department and later-on acquiring cyersecurity skills, while the second observed behavior is
mostly oriented on deep development skills such as for example: Java, .NET and C++. On
MuddyWater and APT33 side, the usage of scripting engines, the usage of powershell, and
the usage of Empire framework tighten together, plus the lack of exploiting capabilities or the
lack in developing sophisticated Malware could bring the analyst to think that those threat
actors hit their target without the need of strong development capabilities. On the other hand
OilRig, Cleaver and CopyKitten looks like to have more software developing skills and looks
to be mostly focused on stealth operations.

Conclusion
In this post I wrote a preliminary and personal analysis of threat actors attributed by the
community to Iran, comparing TTPs coming from MITRE and relations extracted from
Malpedia. The outcome is a proposal to consider the numerous groups (OilRig, APT33,
MuddyWater, Cleaver, etc..) as a primary meta-threat-actor and dividing them by operations
rather real group.
