An In-Depth Look at Black Basta Ransomware
avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-black-basta-ransomware

Executive Summary
In April 2022, a new ransomware group named Black Basta began targeting several highvalue organizations. The ransomware gang has a total of 18 global victims, with the largest
number of victims based in the U.S. Black Basta is known for stealing corporate data and
documents before encrypting devices. They’re also known for their double extortion attacks,
which shame victims into paying the demanded ransom or risk having data leaked on a leak
site.
Last week, Avertium published a Threat Intelligence Report discussing the state of
ransomware in 2022. Ransomware trends are on the rise and one of those trends is victim
shaming – a trend that Black Basta has made used heavily. As we get ready to dive deeper
into the tactics and techniques of Black Basta ransomware, let’s remember that even though
ransomware is here to stay, there are ways to protect your cyber environment and keep your
organization safe from ransomware threat actors like Black Basta.

Black Basta Ransomware
Active since April 2022, Black Basta is both ransomware and a ransomware gang. The gang
has been observed targeting organizations in the U.S with a hyper focus on the construction
and manufacturing industries. They’ve also been observed targeting the real estate,

business services, food and beverage, chemicals, insurance, healthcare, and metals and
mining industries.
Two of the most recent and well known Black Basta attacks include their attack on the
American Dental Association (ADA), as well as their attack on Deustsche Windtechnik.
The ADA is a dentist and oral hygiene advocacy association. The organization had 2.8 GB of
data stolen, with 30% of that data leaked on Black Basta’s leak site. The attack disrupted
some of the organization’s email, phone, and chat systems. The ADA had to take their
systems offline and worked with third party cyber security specialists to determine the
severity of the attack.
The German wind farm operator, Deustsche Windtechnik was attacked in April 2022 and had
to shut off their remote data monitoring connections to their wind turbines for about two days
as they recovered. Despite the company not confirming if they were hit with a ransomware
attack, researchers were able to confirm that they were due to finding the company’s name
on the leak site of Black Basta.
The attack on Deustsche Windtechnik is just one of several cyber attacks on German energy
providers this year. In March 2022, Nordex was forced to shut down their IT systems across
several locations due to a cyber attack. Viasat also suffered from a cyber attack this year,
causing 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany to malfunction. It has not been confirmed if
the ADA or if Deustsche Windtechnik paid a ransom to Black Basta.

techniques and tactics
A deep dive analysis into Black Basta ransomware reveals that the cyber criminals’
ransomware appends the extension “.basta” at the end of encrypted files. According to Cyble
Research Labs, Black Basta is a console-based executable ransomware that can only be
executed with administrator privileges. After the ransomware executes, it deletes shadow
copies by using vssadmin.exe, removing the Windows backup so their victims can’t revert
the system to its previous state after encryption.
After removing the backups, Black Basta drops two image files into the temp folder of the
infected system. Next, the ransomware changes the desktop wallpaper using the API
systemparamaterssinfoW() and uses a file called dlaksjdoiwq.jpg as the desktop
background wallpaper. Once Black Basta creates the registry entry, it hijacks the FAX
service, checking to see if the service name FAX is present in the system. Once it verifies
that it’s present, Black Basta deletes the original, creating a new malicious service named
FAX.
Next, the boot options are checked using GetSystemMetrics() API, while
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\Fax is
added in the registry to start the FAX service in safe mode. After the ransomware reboots the

system using the ShellExecuteA() API, FAX service launches and begins encryption.
According to Cyble Research Labs, the following list of files and folders are excluded from
encryption:
Bin
Windows
Local Settings
Application Data
txt
boot
txt
jpg
DAT
ico
Using FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW) APIs to find files, Black Basta finds the files in
their victim’s machines and encrypts them – using a multithreading approach for faster
encryption.

Researchers believe that Black Basta hasn’t started recruiting affiliates in underground
forums, but their previous advertisements they posted before their attacks suggest they use
stolen credentials (purchased on the dark net) to get into organization’s systems.

connections to conti
The threat actors behind Black Basta were suspected to be a rebrand of the ransomware
gang, Conti. In a previous Threat Intelligence Report we explained that Conti is a Russianspeaking RaaS organization, who uses RaaS to deploy disruptive ransomware attacks that
target critical infrastructure, like hospitals and government organizations. Conti generally
focuses on attacking companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue. They
specialize in double extortion operations of simultaneous data encryption and data
exfiltration for financial gain. If the ransom is not paid, Conti will blackmail their victims by
threatening to publish stolen files.
In May 2021, the FBI notified the public stating that Conti tried to breach over a dozen
healthcare and first responder organizations. By September 2021, the gang successfully
stole the data of several healthcare organizations. In March 2022, we published another
Threat Intelligence Report featuring the gang. This time, we discussed Conti’s leaked internal
chats, published on Twitter by a Ukrainian security researcher in February 2022. The leak
contained several years’ worth of internal chat logs linked to Conti and can be read here.
Because of the leaked chats and Conti’s leaked source code, there was speculation that
Conti’s successful ransomware operation was soon to be dismantled, but researchers found
that not to be the case. In fact, it appears as if Conti has simply started to rebrand and
strategize despite the leaked chats.
When Black Basta hit the scene in April 2022, researchers stated that the ransomware gang
shared similarities with Conti. For example, Black Basta’s data leak site was very similar to
Conti’s data leak site. The gangs also shared the same victim recovery portals. However,
Conti denied that they rebranded as Black Basta and called the group “kids”.

Despite this declaration, researchers still held the belief that Conti rebranded as Black Basta.
When Black Basta was discovered and the similarities between the two groups were pointed
out, there was speculation that Black Basta could have been a faction of Conti that went
rogue, and Conti was not telling the truth. When Conti’s chats were leaked, we not only
learned how the ransomware gang operated, but we also learned how some Conti
employees truly felt about attacking certain critical industries, such as healthcare.
In October of 2020, Conti’s members had plans to attack 400 hospitals in the U.S and in
Britain. The attacks were launched during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when
hospitals needed their computers the most. Additionally, Conti ultimately had access to over
400 healthcare facilities (not specifically hospitals). In May 2021, Conti attacked Ireland’s
Health Service Executive (HSE) that operates the country’s public health system. It ended up
disrupting the public health system and the recovery costs were expected to exceed $600
million.

The attack on HSE led to questions from some Conti members because the members were
under the assumption that the group didn’t attack public resources like hospitals. Some of
Conti’s managers adhered to this policy, and in June 2021, a manager named “Reshaev” told
another user named “Pin” that he wouldn’t attack a target he infiltrated because of this policy.
“Pin” countered “Reshaev” and said that the network belonged to a sports clinic. “Reshaev”
replied that they don’t touch the healthcare sector at all, therefore they would be avoiding the
clinic.
However, the ban wasn’t upheld across the entire Conti organization because in October
2021, “Reshaev” asked someone named “Stern” (the most senior Conti manager) if he
approved of a ransomware attack against a hospital by an affiliate called “Dollar”. However,
there was no reply, so the question was asked again.
Reshaev: “Did you give the green light to the hospital lock to Dollar?”
Stern: “I usually don’t approve locks,” replied Stern. “Dollar” was later sent an encrypted
note.
“Dollar” responded with a series of numbers and sums apparently calculating a 20 percent
share of something. In the case above, you can see how it’s possible for a former Conti
employee to branch off and start their own ransomware gang due to differing opinions.
However, Cyberint Research, dug a little deeper and found that a ransomware sample from
February 2022, generated a ransomware note from a group named “no_name_software”.
The group took responsibility for Black Basta ransomware, and the Onion page disclosed in
the ransom note was the same Onion page Black Basta currently operates.

CONTI REBRANDING INTO SMALLER GROUPS
Conti may not be associated with Black Basta, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t trying to
rebrand at all. According to our partners, AdvIntel, Conti is currently rebranding as multiple
ransomware groups and that the brand, not the organization, is shutting down. On May 19,
2022, Conti’s official website went offline, as well as their negotiations service site. Conti’s
infrastructure (chat rooms, servers, proxy hosts, etc.) went through a massive reset.
The publicity function of Conti’s blog is still active, but the operational function of “Conti
News” (used to upload new data to force victims to pay) is defunct – including infrastructure
related to data uploads, negotiations, and the hosting of stolen data. AdvIntel believes that
Conti can no longer support and obtain extortion and that the shutdown was not
spontaneous but calculated. May 19, 2022 is Conti’s official date of death with their attack on
Costa Rica being their final dance.
The attack on Costa Rica, which forced the country to declare a state of emergency, was
Conti’s way of keeping the illusion that they were still active and diverting everyone’s
attention, while working on their restructuring. During the diversion tactics, Conti’s extension
6/10

groups such as BlackByte and KaraKurt were actively and silently attacking organizations.
Additionally, infiltration specialists who were the backbone of Conti, were forming alliances
with BlackCat, AvosLocker, HIVE, and HelloKitty/FiveHands.
There is no evidence that suggests that Conti’s leaked chats have an impact on their recent
activities, but perhaps the event that provoked the leak (Conti’s support of Russia) in the first
place may have played a part in their demise. By engaging in political discourse, Conti
intervened in Russian state matters, and opened themselves up for scrutiny and attacks from
hacktivists like Anonymous and NB65.
g shorter. This happened with Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855
and CVE-2021-27065).

Stay Vigilant
As we stated in our previous Threat Intelligence Report featuring AvosLocker ransomware,
ransomware trends are on the rise and ambitious threat actors like Black Basta are in it for
the long haul. Black Basta’s recent attacks prove that they are not only consistent but
persistent. Conti even addressed them in their blog when there was speculation surrounding
a connection to the gang. This acknowledgement could be an indicator of Black Basta’s
talent, as well as their gaining popularity. It’s important for organizations to remain vigilant in
implementing cyber security best practices and to keep a watchful eye on threat actors on
the rise.

How Avertium is Protecting Our CUSTOMERS
