Remember when Igor Kuznetsov and Costin Raiu announced that two of the victims in
FireEye's SUNBURST IOC list were ***net.***.com and central.***.gov on Kaspersky's
Securelist blog in December? Reuters later reported that these victims were Cox
Communications and Pima County.
We can now reveal that the internal AD domain of all SUNBURST deployments in FireEye's
IOC list can be extracted from publicly available DNS logs published by twitter user VriesHd,
a.k.a. "Kira 2.0", with help of our SunburstDomainDecoder tool. The data published by
VriesHd is the most complete SUNBURST DNS collection we've seen, with over 35.000
avsvmcloud.com subdomains! Here is FireEye's IOC table completed with our findings:

Victims Targeted with SUNBURST Stage 2 Backdoor

1/7

It was not just the victims listed in FireEye's IOC that were specifically targeted by the
SUNBURST operators. As explained in our Finding Targeted SUNBURST Victims with pDNS
blog post, the "STAGE2" flag in SUNBURST's DNS beacons can be used to reveal additional
organizations that were singled out as interesting targets by the threat actors.
We'd like to stress that the majority of all companies and organizations that have installed a
backdoored SolarWinds Orion update were never targeted by the threat actors. This means
the these SUNBURST backdoors never made it past what we call "Stage 1 operation",
where the backdoor encodes the internal AD domain name and installed security products
into DNS requests. SUNBURST backdoors in Stage 1 operation cannot accept any
commands from the C2 server without first progressing into Stage 2 operation. We estimate
that about 99.5% of the installed SUNBURST backdoors never progressed into Stage 2
operation.
Here is the full list of internal AD domain names from the SUNBURST deployments in
VriesHd's DNS data that actually did enter Stage 2 operation according to our analysis:

central.pima.gov (confirmed)
cisco.com (confirmed)
corp.qualys.com (confirmed)
coxnet.cox.com (confirmed)
ddsn.gov
fc.gov
fox.local
ggsg-us.cisco.com (confirmed)
HQ.FIDELIS (confirmed)
jpso.gov
lagnr.chevrontexaco.net
logitech.local
los.local
mgt.srb.europa* (confirmed)
ng.ds.army.mil
2/7

nsanet.local (not the NSA)
paloaltonetworks* (confirmed)
phpds.org
scc.state.va.us (confirmed)
suk.sas.com
vgn.viasatgsd.com
wctc.msft
WincoreWindows.local
Our SUNBURST STAGE2 Victim Table has now been updated with additional details about
the STAGE2 signaling from these SUNBURST implants, including timestamps,
avsvmcloud.com subdomains and GUID values.
Initial Microsoft Targeting FAIL
The last two entries in the AD domain list above are interesting, since they both hint that the
targeted entity might be Microsoft.
The data that gets exfiltrated in DNS beacons during SUNBURST's initial stage is the
internal domain the SolarWinds Orion PC is connected to and a list of installed security
products on that PC. These domain names, security products and possibly also the victims'
public IP addresses, was the data available to the attackers when they decided which ones
they wanted to proceed to Stage 2 with and thereby activate the HTTPS backdoor built into
SUNBURST.
The threat actors were probably surprised when they realized that "WincoreWindows.local"
was in fact a company in West Virginia that manufactures high quality windows and doors.

3/7

The threat actors later found another backdoored SolarWinds Orion machine connected to a
domain called "wctc.msft", which also sounds like it could be Microsoft. Below is a table
outlining relevant events for these two SUNBURST deployments that can be extracted from
VriesHd's SB2 spreadsheet with SunburstDomainDecoder.

Microsoft have been public about being hit by SUNBURST (or "Solorigate" as they call it), so
we can assume that the threat actors eventually located a backdoored SolarWinds Orion
installation in their networks.
Victim Notification
We spent the previous week reaching out to targeted companies and organizations, either
directly or through CERT organizations. From what we understand many of these
organizations were already aware that they had been targeted victims of SUNBURST, even
though they might not have gone public about the breach.
The Ethical Dilemma
We have no intentions to shame the organizations that have installed a backdoored
SolarWinds Orion update, regardless if they were targeted by the threat actor or not. In fact,
the supply chain security problem is an extremely difficult one to tackle, even for companies
and organizations with very high security standards. This could have happened to anyone!
However, since multiple passive DNS logs and SUNBURST victim lists have been circulating
through publicly available channels for over a month, we felt that it was now acceptable to
publicly write about the analysis we've been doing based on all this data. We'd also like to
thank everyone who has helped collect and share passive DNS data, including John
Bambenek, Joe SÅ‚owik, Rohit Bansal, Dancho Danchev , Paul Vixie and VriesHd. This open
data has been crucial in order to develop and verify our SunburstDomainDecoder tool, which
has been leveraged by numerous incident response teams to perform forensic analysis of
DNS traffic from their SolarWinds Orion deployments.
More Credits
We'd like to thank CERT-SE and all other computer emergency response organizations that
have helped us with the task of notifying organizations that were identified as targeted. We
would also like to applaud companies and organizations like FireEye, Palo Alto Networks,
5/7

Fidelis Cybersecurity, Microsoft, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Federal Courts
for being transparent and publicly announcing that the SUNBURST backdoor had been used
in an attempt to compromise their networks.
