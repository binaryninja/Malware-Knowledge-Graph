The Internet has changed many aspects of modern life, from communication with friends to
how we watch TV or listen to music. It has also changed the way we engage in conflict with
others; this can be seen on a micro level in the emergence of cyber bullying or at the macro
level in the declaration by the U.S. Department of Defense declaring “Cyber” a fifth domain of
warfare.
Cyber conflict can be an equalizer for adversaries who have limited ability to achieve their
goals through other conventional avenues. As an example, take the case of individuals
supportive of the Syrian regime; these supporters have little ability to engage in kinetic
warfare against Western or anti-regime targets in the physical world, but leveraging cyber
attacks is well within their capability.
Over the past three months, the adversary designated by CrowdStrike as DEADEYE
JACKAL (commonly known as the Syrian Electronic Army) carried out a number of attacks
against major media outlets. In mid-August, reports emerged that the adversary successfully
redirected visitors to the major media websites such as the Washington Post to a DEADEYE
JACKAL-controlled website; the actor also claimed to have similarly compromised the
websites of CNN and Time. Several weeks later, DEADEYE JACKAL successfully took down
the New York Times’ website through a DNS redirection.
It is interesting to note that these were not direct attacks against the targeted organizations’
networks; they were carried out by compromising the networks of third-party service
providers. These third parties were leveraged by the targets to support social media
marketing, content publishing, advertising, and domain registration/hosting. Compromising
these vendors is a new tactic for DEADEYE JACKAL, who leveraged it as a force multiplier.
This tactic negated the necessity of compromising three hard targets, allowing the adversary
to increase impact dramatically by finding a common link and exploiting it. The attacks by
DEADEYE JACKAL were clearly motivated by press surrounding the conflict in Syria that
was critical of the Syrian regime. This adversary is supportive of the current Syrian regime,
and it likely desired to control the messaging it felt was driving international anti-regime
sentiment. In general, these attacks were disruptive and did not target sensitive data of the
media outlets or service providers. These attacks represent the emerging threat of regional
conflicts spilling over into the cyber domain and damaging or embarrassing entities far
outside of the conflict zone.
Desire to control messaging about the Syrian regime motivated DEADEYE JACKAL’s
targeting of the media; however, they could easily adjust targeting toward more impactful
targets. As an example, DEADEYE JACKAL may have similarly decided that Western
1/3

financial institutions would be an effective target to dissuade kinetic involvement of external
militaries. Financial entities in the U.S. have already been victimized by attackers calling
themselves the “Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam” who purportedly seek retribution for
an offensive video posted to a popular video sharing site. DEADEYE JACKAL could also turn
its sights on entities within the defense industrial base, as the weapons produced by those
companies might be used in a strike against Syrian government forces. Organizations in the
oil and gas sector could also be targeted if the adversary views interference in the Syrian
conflict as a pretext to secure access to oil resources in the region. Whatever the business
vertical one can come up with, there is a potential reason why an irrational actor motivated
by self defense might seek to leverage cyber attacks against it.
The spillover of regional conflict is also demonstrated by the activity of another adversary
designated by CrowdStrike as CORSAIR JACKAL (also known as the Tunisian Cyber Army).
During 2013, this adversary carried out a smaller number of high-profile attacks aimed at
organizations in the financial, oil and gas, and shipping sectors. Additionally, in March 2013
the adversary also made unconfirmed claims that it compromised a large user database from
a financial institution. Although CORSAIR JACKAL’s operations were not as visible as those
of DEADEYE JACKAL, the adversary represents another instance of malicious cyber activity
emanating from a tumultuous region directed at organizations that may not have a clear
connection to the conflict in that region. In the case of CORSAIR JACKAL, the only
legitimacy needed to target Western businesses was anti-Western sentiment from perceived
interference by Western governments in theatre.
Organizations across all sectors must consider the risk of conflict in the physical world
spilling over into the cyber domain and resulting in malicious actors targeting their systems,
operations, or customers. The use of cyber attacks is not declining; it is rapidly proliferating.
As tools become easier to acquire, use, and modify, new adversaries are stepping on to the
cyber domain from all over the world every day.
It is for these reasons that CrowdStrike advocates an intelligence-driven approach to
security; the CrowdStrike Intelligence team tracks adversaries emanating from geographic
locations across the globe and various motivations. This past quarter we identified multiple
new adversaries with specific Tactics, Techniques, and Practices (TTPs) and associated
actionable indicators for our intelligence subscription customers. These new adversaries
include the two nationalistically motivated actors discussed above, DEADEYE JACKAL and
CORSAIR JACKAL, and a number of others engaged in targeted intrusion operations such
as STONE PANDA, NIGHTSHADE PANDA, GOBLIN PANDA, and MAGIC KITTEN.
