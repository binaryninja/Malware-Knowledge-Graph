Void Balaur | The Sprawling Infrastructure of a Careless
Mercenary

Executive Summary
The cyber mercenary group known as Void Balaur continues to expand their hack-forhire campaigns into 2022 unphased by disruptions to their online advertising personas.
New targets include a wide variety of industries, often with particular business or
political interests tied to Russia. Void Balaur also goes after targets valuable for
prepositioning or facilitating future attacks. Their targets span the United States,
Russia, Ukraine, and various other countries.
Attacks are often very generic in theme, may appear opportunistic in nature, and
account for targets making use of multi-factor authentication. The group seeks access
to well-known email services (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo), social media (Facebook,
Instagram), messaging (Telegram), and corporate accounts.
A unique and short-lived connection links Void Balaur’s infrastructure to the Russian
Federal Protective Service (FSO), a low-confidence indication of a potential customer
relationship or resource sharing between the two.

Overview

1/27

Void Balaur is a highly active hack-for-hire / cyber mercenary group with a wide range of
known target types across the globe. Their services have been observed for sale to the
public online since at least 2016. Services include the collection of private data and access
to specific online email and social media services, such as Gmail, Outlook, Telegram,
Yandex, Facebook, Instagram, and business emails.
Void Balaur was first reported in 2019 (eQualitie), then again in 2020 (Amnesty
International). In November 2021, our colleagues at Trend Micro profiled the larger set of
malicious activity and named the actor “Void Balaur” based on a monster of Eastern
European folklore. Most recently Google’s TAG highlighted some of their activity earlier this
year. Building on top of analysis from each of our above colleagues, the purpose here is to
share our analysis of interesting findings based on newer activity and the large scale set of
attacker infrastructure.
During our inaugural LABScon event today I presented on this very topic – a careless
mercenary group known as Void Balaur. Attendees of the conference were given a more
detailed overview of the content shared here, including specific details on attribution to
individuals in Latvia. In the spirit of LABScon, I look forward to further tracking of this actor
alongside our industry colleagues to better protect society.

The Hack-for-Hire Business
The hack-for-hire service offering linked to Void Balaur has been advertised through various
brand names, as also noted by previous reporting. These are only two early examples of
likely others run by the same entity.
First is Hacknet, or “Hackernet-Service”, which began operating in late 2016. In these early
years of activity, the group advertised their “Professional Hacking to Order” service for good
and to help meet the needs others can not meet. The name can be found advertising across
many darkweb forums.

The section on legality of their service provides insight into the mindset and justification of
the attacker.

Hacknet-Service legality section – Translated
Services first offered for hacking at the time included Yandex, Rambler, Mail.ru, Gmail,
UKR.net, Yahoo, Outlook, corporate email, Instagram, VK.com, OK.ru, Facebook, and
Skype, in addition to “Hacking Training”.
A year later in 2017 the group removed the services of hacking Outlook, Facebook, and
UKR.net while adding ICQ messages. In 2018, the group updated their legality pitch noting
that corporate email and other requests outside of their advertised list would be considered.
Additionally, the group began offering services around content modification/uploading to
email and social media networks.

4/27

Hacknet-Service Offerings Section – Translated
Ultimately, the Hacknet persona and their service ended around early 2020 following bans
across services and brand collapse after failing to follow through with hacking services they
were paid for.
The second example is “RocketHack”, which became active in early 2018, acting as a
second persona operated by the same entity.

5/27

The RocketHack persona and offerings were thoroughly documented in the TrendMicro
report. Interestingly, in our screenshot of their landing page, they used a quote from Nikolay
Kononov’s book Kod Durova, a story on the creation of the Russian VK social network.
Around 2019, Hacknet and RocketHack began offering services through various hacker
forums to provide information on individuals, including banking and government documents.
The personas also begin to offer services for:
Remote access or perform requested actions on target PCs
Remove content from any blogs, forums, YouTube Channels, news sites or databases
“of any institution”.
Cleanup information online, and manipulate search engine results.
Remote access to iPhones, mobile tracking, manulating associated data.
SMS historical records of targets.
Real time location tracking through mobile networks.

Void Balaur Infrastructure

6/27

As of this blog, Void Balaur has operated over 5,000 unique domains used against individual
targets. With a quantity of actor controlled domains in the thousands, each provides us an
opportunity for the attacker to make mistakes and lead us to a new set of useful clues.
Focusing on the most recent activity from Void Balaur, the set of domains follow a repeating
generic set of patterns.
Free Email Services
E.g., mail-my-accounts-gmail[.]com
Email Security / Privacy
E.g., security-my-account[.]ru
Email Authentication / OAuth
accounts-oauth-gmail[.]com
Passports / Local Government (Limited, often Russian focus)
E.g., no-reply-gosuslugi[.]ru
The collection of associated attacker infrastructure, such as domains and non-shared IPs, is
quite large and requires automated methods of tracking to keep up.

Synapse Visual Representation of Domain Scale
Based on our collection of all known Void Balaur domains, we can determine the creation
time of each based on year for an estimate of actor campaign activity. While early years
activity was generally a very small set of infrastructure, we can note the explosion of activity
in 2019. Around this time is when the group was gaining a bad reputation and abandoning
brands (Hacknet). This indicates that the group remained highly active without a well known
brand, potentially fulfilling requests for customers without the need to publicly advertise
anymore.
7/27

It’s worth noting that the 2022 quantity is lower than expected at this time. However, the
group historically has registered domains in bulk rather than evenly throughout the year.
Additionally, we have observed a new set of infrastructure and campaigns we believe may be
Void Balaur; however, technical links are not yet confident enough to publicly share at this
time. Such activity could be an entirely unique group, or a new phase of Void Balaur
attempting to evade further tracking.

Domain Count by Year

Intriguing Relationships
A potential indicator of the careless OPSEC in the Void Balaur infrastructure is a low
confidence connection to the Russian Federal Protective / Guard Service (FSO). The FSO
institution operates with a range of capabilities, including the right to conduct surveillance,
monitor communications, and operate clandestine activities. Was this a customerconfidentiality oversight by Void Balaur? Perhaps a mistake in the workflow of expanding
their infrastructure? The meaning and exact technical reason behind this connection is
unclear; however, based on our attribution to technical operators outside of Russia, it is
potentially a clue that Russian intelligence agencies are somehow involved with Void Balaur
and the FSO is either directly using the services or supporting the use of the services
internally.
Specifically, one domain in the thousands of those created and operated by Void Balaur over
the years was seen immediately resolving to the Russian FSO network after it was
registered. In early 2022 the domain accounts-my-mail-gmail[.]com resolved to
95.173.132[.]1 for four days following its registration, then quickly shifting to the
8/27

traditional Void Balaur cluster of infrastructure. The IP 95.173.132[.]1 is owned and
operated by the Russian FSO, typically reserved for official .ru government websites. To
reiterate, this connection is only observed once in the entirety of Void Balaur infrastructure.

Targeting
Void Balaur continues their known targeting of a wide variety of individuals and organizations
across the globe. The vast majority of known 2022 targets hold a special interest or
involvement in business and political situations relevant to organizations inside Russia.
Examples include individuals heavily involved in geopolitics, legal, business transactions,
technology, human rights and more. Locations of these individuals include:
Russia
United States
United Kingdom
Taiwan
Brazil
Kazakhstan
Ukraine

Georgia
Spain
Central African Republic
Sudan

2022 Target Map
We observed continued targeting in 2022 making use of generic, highly reproducible,
phishing emails to lure targets into providing account credentials. Based on thousands of
phishing domains we collected, Google owned services are the most common targets and
attack themes.
However, in most cases the phishing emails are somewhat more relevant to the target of
choice. For example, this includes emails designed to mimic local government services, or
online websites common to a particular target, such as banking or social media. Void Balaur
has made use of this approach for much of its existence. Examples include a 2016 attempt
at phishing on the Moscow motorcycle road racing Youtuber Alexey Naberezhny, and in
2017 the Russian journalist and social media personality Ilya Varlamov. These individuals
were targeted by Void Balaur with phishing emails spoofing Russian Public Services traffic
fines.

In this case, the payment link goes to srv-gm[.]ru , accountc-gooogle.com , and
others, which returns an illicit Google login page.

12/27

Google Phishing Page
In 2022, we observed cases in which Void Balaur sought to compromise Google accounts
with multi-factor authentication enabled as well. For example, some phishing pages would
ask the target to enter backup codes Google provides during the initial 2-Step verification
setup process.

Conclusion
14/27

Void Balaur remains a highly active and evolving threat to individuals across the globe. From
the targeting of well known email services to the offering of hacking corporate networks, the
group represents a clear example of the hack-for-hire market. We expect this type of actor to
be increasingly common to observe in the wild.
