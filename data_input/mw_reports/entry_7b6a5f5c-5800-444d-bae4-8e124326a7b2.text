RISE FROM THE ASHES! HADES RANSOMWARE OPERATORS CONTINUE TO
PROLIFERATE ATTACKS, DEPLOYING NEW VARIANTS ALONG THE WAY.
Accenture Security – Cyber Investigations, Forensic & Response (CIFR), Accenture Cyber
Threat Intelligence (ACTI)
Executive Summary
In March 2021, Accenture Security identified a previously unknown financially
motivated threat group using the self-proclaimed Hades ransomware variant in
cybercrime operations that impacted multiple victims.
Since the March reporting, additional victims have been targeted in the consumer
goods & services, insurance, and manufacturing & distribution industry verticals.
Accenture security assesses with a moderate-to-high level of confidence that in
addition to the Hades variant, the threat group has added at least one new
ransomware variant to their arsenal, Phoenix Cryptolocker, possibly to deter
attribution claims or campaign links.

1/9

Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) employed by the threat group have
remained relatively consistent over time, including significant overlap in intrusion sets
across known victims.
However, some unique and destructive actions were observed across intrusions, such
as targeted enumeration of cloud environments and destruction of cloud-native
backups or snapshots.
Accenture Security assesses with moderate confidence that the threat group does not
operate under an affiliate-based model or ransomware as a service (RaaS) operation.
While previous industry reporting by Crowdstrike and SecureWorks attribute the
operations to Evil Corp and Gold Winter respectively, Accenture Security is not yet
able to confidently make attribution claims based on observed intrusion clusters.
The information outlined in this blog is based on collection from CIFR incident response
engagements, threat intelligence insights, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), and various
media and industry reports.
This is a developing story; additional technical analysis of the intrusion clusters, attacker
TTPs and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) will be released to the community in a separate
blog post.

Summary & timeline update
Accenture Security assesses with a moderate-to-high level of confidence that a previously
reported unknown threat group is now using multiple ransomware variants in cybercrime
operations that have impacted at least seven (7) victims. Based on collection sources, the
threat group has been in operations since at least December 2020 and has continued to
target victims through May 2021. Accenture Security also analyzed the group's activities in
the context of attribution, victimology, and TTPs employed based on collection from industry

publications, OSINT and incident response data. Accenture Security assesses the group's
operations are well underway, and their activity will likely continue to proliferate into the
foreseeable future, impacting additional carefully selected victims.
Victimology update
Based on our collection sources, we are currently aware of at least seven (7) victims
spanning multiple industry verticals. Consistent with previous reporting, all known victims
are large multi-national organizations with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion USD. The
profiles of the known victims continue to be a consistent indicator of Big Game Hunting, with
target selection and deployment methods aimed toward high-value payouts.

Commonalities across intrusions
Despite the numerous similarities in the potentially linked intrusion sets described herein,
there are very few similarities between the victims themselves beyond geography. This
includes few overlaps in industry vertical, political ideology, or public status.
As previously noted, the most significant commonality between victims is that they all fall
into the category of “big game ransomware targets”12, large companies with the perceived
ability to pay larger ransoms demanded by the threat actors.
In all cases, the threat actors used a relatively standard toolkit with only minor variations,
including but not limited to the following:
Credential access via VPN and SocGholish malware delivered via a malicious Google
Chrome update were found to be the primary infection vectors across victims.
Advanced IP scanner was utilized for reconnaissance.
3/9

PSexec was used for lateral movement and deployment of the ransomware.
The threat actors also made heavy use of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral
movement.
Mimikatz was used for credential access.
Similar batch files used to disable Microsoft Windows Defender and other antivirus
software, stop services and clear even logs.
Threat actors often operated out of the root of C:ProgramData where several
executables tied to the intrusion set were found.
Consistent use of Cobalt Strike.
Commonalities in C2 domains were found across intrusions.
In at least two (2) intrusions, targeted destruction of backups prior to encryption.
7zip utility was used to archive data that was then staged and exfiltrated to an
attacker-controlled server hosted in Mega[.]nz cloud infrastructure, leveraging the
MEGAsync utility.
Hades ransomware operations
Accenture Security assesses that careful target selection and a unique approach to victim
communication, combined with a “lone wolf” approach, also may explain the relatively low
number of known victims since Hades was first identified publicly in December 2020. Lone
wolf ransomware groups typically operate outside of the affiliate-based model and don’t
consistently participate in RaaS operations. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean they
are not a well-resourced group in and of themselves. In addition, consistent with analysis
published by SecureWorks, the ACTI team did not identify related activity on underground
forums and criminal marketplaces, further supporting our assessment.
Based on updated intrusion data from incident response engagements, the operators tailor
their tactics and tooling to carefully selected targets and run a more “hands on keyboard”
operation to inflict maximum damage and higher payouts. This includes multi-million-dollar
(USD) ransom demands, and in at least two (2) instances, successful payment. However,
while portions of each intrusion chain may seem “novel” in nature, their approach suggests
a moderate level of operational and technical sophistication, as the operators leverage a
mostly standard toolkit and often use “noisy” approaches for reconnaissance. In at least one
instance, the targeted organization successfully deterred the attack before impact, so the
intended action on objectives are unknown.
Compromise Activity & Detection Opportunities
Initial Access
The primary methods for initial access into the victim’s network includes internet-facing
systems via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) using
legitimate credentials, as well as SocGholish malware delivered via fake Chrome browser
updates.

4/9

Persistence
The use of legitimate credentials, service creation, and distribution of Command and
Control (C2) beacons across victim environments through the use of Cobalt Strike and
Empire, seem to be the predominant approach used by the threat group to further their
foothold and maintain persistence.
In addition, consistent with previous reporting, the threat actors operated out of the root of
C:ProgramData where several executables tied to the intrusion set were found.
Privilege Escalation
Credential harvesting and subsequent privilege escalation achieved through the use of
tooling to include mimikatz and manual enumeration of credentials found within files.
Defense Evasion
Impeding defenses was achieved through use of domain administrator credentials and
includes the following:
Batch script that leverages wevtutil.exe to clear event logs on impacted hosts
Disabling Anti-Virus (AV) products on endpoints
Modification of GPO to disable windows audit logging
Manually disabling Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools and prevention
policies through the user interface
Discovery
Observed multiple methods for internal network reconnaissance, including various
reconnaissance scripts and tools such as Advanced Port Scanner used to collect network,
host, and domain information.
Lateral Movement
Lateral movement accomplished via compromised accounts obtained during internal
reconnaissance activities. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and PSexec were also
leveraged for host-to-host lateral movement.
In one incident, the threat actor installed a custom build of Chrome.exe and leveraged the
native browser capabilities to manually target the victim’s cloud environments. This activity
included enumeration of high-value accounts and targeted destruction of data and backups
through the cloud management console.
In addition, the attempted use of KeeThief for lateral movement was observed. This tool is
often used by threat actors to abuse credentials stored in KeePass databases. Specifically,
threat actors deployed an instance of KeeThief.ps1—an open-source PowerShell package
written in 2016 designed to compromise credentials stored in memory on a system with an
open KeePass database.

5/9

Command and Control
In most of the recent incidents, the threat actors utilized the ubiquitous Cobalt Strike postexploitation framework for command and control within the impacted environments with at
least two (2) external beacons per environment. Command and control was also
established using remote manipulator system 3(RMS).
Exfiltration & Impact
Prior to deploying ransomware, the unknown threat group has employed the 7zip utility to
archive data that was then staged and exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server hosted in
Mega[.]nz cloud infrastructure, leveraging the MEGAsync utility. In addition to data theft,
actors deploy ransomware with PSexec to encrypt files identified on the victim network. The
operators leverage this approach for "double-extortion" tactics.
Mitigation recommendations
Ensure a robust crisis management and incident response plan are in place in the
event of a data breach or ransomware incident.
Consider developing continuity of operations plans (COOP) that account for
ransomware or wiper attacks that can spread across the business.
Employ a resilient backup strategy and architecture using a “no-silo” approach.
Avoid opening or downloading suspicious links from external sources until confirming
legitimacy.
Maintain best practices against ransomware, such as patching, updating anti-virus
software, implementing strict network egress policies, and using application
whitelisting where feasible.
Install and update anti-virus software to proactively identify and protect against
malware.
Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) across the environment, targeting at
least 90% workload visibility.
Employ a strong corporate password policy.
Use MFA where possible for authenticating corporate accounts to include remote
access mechanisms and security tools. Admin accounts should be cross-platform
MFA enforced.
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections with complex passwords, virtual
private networks (VPNs) and Network Level Authentication (NLA), if RDP connections
must be used.
Patch infrastructure to the highest available level, as threat actors are often better
able to exploit older systems with existing vulnerabilities.
Encrypt data-at-rest where possible and protect related keys and technology.
Do not store credentials in files and scripts on shared locations.
Close password management applications after use.
Where possible, deny caching of credentials in memory (e.g., Credential Guard).
