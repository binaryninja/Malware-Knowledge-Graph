How Can I Tell if I Was
Infected By Aurora?
McAfee Labs identified a zero-day
vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer
that was used as an entry point for
“Operation Aurora” to exploit Google and at
least 30 other companies.

Rasmon.dll:
0F9C5408335833E72FE73E6166B5A01B

How can I tell if my systems were
infected?

If you are a McAfee VirusScan Engine
customer, verify that you are using .DAT
5864 released on January 18, 2010
(McAfee has provided protection to identify
this as of release 5862 and is updating as
we continue to debug the attack) and
perform a full scan on all machines within
your enterprise, starting with most sensitive
servers. If you detect the following
signatures triggered: Exploit-Comele,
Roarur.dr or Roarur.dll, you very likely have
an infected Aurora host and should reach
out toMcAfee Foundstone, our vulnerability
management and protection services division,
for onsite Incident Response Services. You

Stinger product, used to clean up an Operation
Aurora-infected system.

If I’m not a McAfee customer…
If you are not a McAfee Virus Scan Engine
customer and your anti-malware vendor
does not provide comprehensive detection
for Aurora binaries, you can perform
filename and md5 hash searches on your
servers to determine if you have any
matches that way. You should ensure that
the md5 hash matches along with the
filename to avoid false positives, as the
filenames themselves are not unique and
are very common Windows OS and other
legitimate program filenames. The list of
files and hashes is as follows:
