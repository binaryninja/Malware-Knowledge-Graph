What is Phobos Ransomware?

Phobos is a type of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) ransomware that was first seen in
October 2017 but became increasingly active in 2019. Also referred to as Phobos NextGen
or Phobos Not Dharma, Phobos ransomware is extremely similar to the Dharma and Crysis
ransomware family due to the same Dharma codebase. It is an offline file-encoding virus that
targets Windows operating systems. Phobos is offered as a Ransomware-as-a-Service
1/7

(RaaS) package on the top-tier Eastern European forums. Phobos is an increasingly
dangerous and credible ransomware threat that usually targets business and occasionally
customers.

How Does it Work?

There are multiple ways for Phobos ransomware to end up on your device. The payload can
be distributed as an attachment through traditional phishing schemes, through open and
poorly secured Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, and through fake system
updates. There are multiple ways that Phobos gains access to RDP connections: by using
brute-force to get RDP credentials, using stolen or bought RDP credentials, or through an
insecure connection on port 3389. Once deployed, the payload locks the victim’s files and
then places two ransom notes–one .txt and one .hta–on their desktop. In addition to locking
the victim’s files, Phobos deletes any shadow copies or backups of the files, as well as the
system, restore point.

As soon as the victim views the .hta ransom note, which pops up automatically, negotiations
can begin with Phobos operators. While most ransom notes are unique to the type of
ransomware being used, the rhetoric in the ransom notes that Phobos places on the victim’s
desktop are identical to the one that Dharma used. The only difference between the notes is
that in Phobos’ ransom note they have placed their name on the note, effectively branding it
as theirs.

The ransom note offers an email for the victim to contact the operator to negotiate the
ransom. Once the victim has reached out, the initial response from Phobos is, again, a copy
of the initial response that Dharma used. However, Phobos has added a section that aims to
convince the victim to pay another 0.1 Bitcoin (BTC) for the operator to give the victim
security advice, on top of the amount in BTC the victim is being asked to pay to decrypt their
files. Before paying the ransom, the victim is instructed to send 5 files below a certain size to
be decrypted for free.

The average ransom ranges from $5,000-$6,000, but it must be paid in Bitcoin. However,
this amount is because as negotiations continue and the ransom is still not paid, the ransom
is increased from the original amount of usually $3,000. The average negotiation period
between a victim and a Phobos operator lasts about 8 days. This is a longer average
2/7

negation period than other ransomware syndicates usually have, which could be due to
unorganized and unprofessional amateur hackers using Phobos. Phobos is sold as RaaS
packages on the Dark Web, which gives hackers and cybercriminals with little to no skill the
ability to deploy effective and established ransomware. Victims have found that it was difficult
to get their files decrypted and on multiple occasions, the decryption tool was not provided
after the ransom was paid.

Phobos and the Underground

Phobos operates with a RaaS (ransomware-as-a-service) model. On April 11, 2019, with
using their representative on underground forums announced that they were looking for
affiliate partners to use their ransomware, Phobos. This was the beginning of a long forum
thread, with posts as recent as February 2020 that give insight into how Phobos has evolved
over the past year. The initial post by its representative from April of last year was meant to
entice new partners to use Phobos; they detailed how the software works, how to get in
touch with Phobos developers, and some of the guidelines for using the ransomware.

The post begins by describing Phobos as a “popular offline cryptolocker.” Phobos
representative continues by detailing that the software is run completely offline–it does not
require an internet connection to run–and while it is running it does not attract additional
attention. In addition, when the infected device is turned on and off, Phobos will automatically
scan for the presence of connected external and network devices, and if it finds any it will
encrypt their data. The Phobos representative also discussed other aspects of their software,
including its productivity, automatic functions, and file encryption. They also mentioned that
this ransomware could not be used to target Russian or Commonwealth of Independent
State (CIS) entities. Throughout the post, the ransomware administrator emphasized that
Phobos is secure, easy to use and that there is a direct line of communication between
partners and developers, no intermediaries necessary.

Despite their best effort to peddle Phobos ransomware, its representative was met with
skepticism and accusations by many prominent members of the forum. In mid-April 2019, the
ransomware representative responded to a post and defended Phobos ransomware. They
explained that the software had been updated on April 4, 2019, and again emphasized their
open channels of communication between affiliates and developers. This was not the first
instance of criticism and questioning of the ransomware on the thread.

Phobos and Dharma

One prominent underground forum user brought up the similarities between Phobos and
Dharma. Simply put, the user asked if this ransomware was also Dharma. The ransomware
representative quickly responded that it was not. In May 2019, over a month after this
exchange, the Phobos representative posted that a new software update had been released
and that they were continuing to recruit affiliate partners. They were again met with
comments that Phobos and Dharma are the same, this time by the GandCrab themselves.

Image 1: Phobos team denies being the same as Dharma. This denial triggered harsh
responses from the community, illustrating the toxicity and over-competitiveness of the
current ransomware black market.

Following this criticism, the ransomware representative posted a longer explanation of the
differences between Dharma and Phobos in June of 2019. According to the group’s
spokesperson, Phobos is based on Dharma, but it is “written from scratch” and offers better
security. They again emphasize that Phobos is constantly being updated and improved.
Two months later, on June 16, 2019, the ransomware representative again updated the
thread and described the Phobos’ new update. They referred to the update at “version 2.7.”
They described the update as:
Stable offline cryptolocker, written in C++ without STL, MSIL, CRT.
Encrypts with the AES256 algorithm.
Encrypts local, removable drives and network folders.
There is the possibility of full and partial encryption.
Deletes shadow copies and restore points.

4/7

Closes processes blocking access to files.
File size:
54kb (standard configuration with HTML page)
47kb (standard configuration without HTML page)
It has a flexible configuration system, according to your desire you can configure:
Lists of files that are encrypted
Lists of critical files that are encrypted in the first place
Disable partial encryption for critical files
Lists of exceptions
Lists of programs that need to be closed
Bypass UAC, launch offers from the administrator, or work with the privileges with
which it was originally launched
Secure file deletion after encryption
A message in the form of a text file, in the form of HTML, or both
Message text and HTML code
If you have [large] volumes [of access logs and credentials], we can modify the
software to your needs.
Again, the ransomware representative encouraged interested parties to reach out to them via
Jabber.

On February 6th, of this year, Phobos team again posted outlining the newest update to
Phobos, “version 2.9.” This update added a configuration file and the option for users to
specify exclusion files. The thread ends on February 11, 2020, when the representative
again works to defend Phobos from critics and reiterate that the developers are always
available through Jabber.

This is currently the latest version of this ransomware.

include modular configuration as well as manual encryption folders of interest.

Conclusion

As one can see from the forum threads, Phobos is continuously evolving to be more effective
while simultaneously recruiting new users. From previous accounts of negotiations, many
Phobos operators are unskilled or unprofessional, but that does not make the use of this
ransomware any less dangerous. As Phobos continues to evolve, there may be more
updates to come on the ransomware in the coming months and throughout the year.
