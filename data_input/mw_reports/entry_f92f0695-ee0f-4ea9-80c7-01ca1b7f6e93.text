The Cybereason Global Security Operations Center (GSOC) Team issues Cybereason Threat
Analysis Reports to inform on impacting threats. The Threat Analysis Reports investigate these
threats and provide practical recommendations for protecting against them.
In this Threat Analysis report, Cybereason GSOC team analysts have analyzed a case that
involved a Bumblebee Loader infection. Following this introduction, we describe in detail the attack
chain from the initial Bumblebee infection to the compromise of the entire network.

Key Findings
User-Driven Execution: The majority of the infections with Bumblebee we have observed
started by end-users executing LNK files which use a system binary to load the malware.
Distribution of the malware is done by phishing emails with an attachment or a link to the
malicious archive containing Bumblebee.
Intensive Reconnaissance and Data Exfiltration: Bumblebee operators conduct intensive
reconnaissance activities and redirect the output of executed commands to files for
exfiltration.
Active Directory Compromise: The attackers compromised Active Directory and leveraged
confidential data such as users’ logins and passwords for lateral movement. The time it took
between initial access and Active Directory compromise was less than two days.
Under Active Development: Cybereason GSOC has observed threat actors transitioning
from BazarLoader, Trickbot, and IcedID to Bumblebee, which seems to be in active
development and generally the loader of choice for many threat actors.
Critical Severity: Attacks involving Bumblebee must be treated as critical. Based on GSOC
findings, the next step for the threat actors is ransomware deployment, and this loader is
known for ransomware delivery.
Cybereason Managed Detection and Response (MDR): The Cybereason GSOC team has
a zero-tolerance policy towards attacks involving Bumblebee and any other loader, and
categorizes such attacks as critical, high-severity incidents. The Cybereason GSOC MDR
Team issues a comprehensive report to customers when such an incident occurs. The report
provides an in-depth overview of the incident, which helps to understand the scope of the
compromise and the impact on the customer’s environment. These reports also provide
attribution information whenever possible, as well as recommendations for threat mitigation
and isolation.
Detected and Prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform effectively detects and
prevents infections from Bumblebee.

Introduction
In March 2022, a new malware loader was discovered by Google Threat Analysis Group. ​This
loader is named Bumblebee because of its unique user agent, “Bumblebee,” that is used as part of
the communication with the command and control server (C2).
Cybereason GSOC observed the distribution of the loader via spear phishing emails which contain
archives with ISO files as attachments or links to download the archive from external sources. The
initial execution relies on the end-user execution which has to extract the archive, mount an ISO
2/21

image file, and click a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.
After initial execution, the most notable post-exploitation activities performed by Bumblebee are
privilege escalation, reconnaissance, and credential theft, which are detailed in this report.
Bumblebee operators use the Cobalt Strike framework throughout the attack. The threat actors use
the obtained credentials to access Active Directory and make a copy of ntds.dit containing data for
the entire Active Directory. Lastly, a domain administrator account is used to move laterally, create
local user accounts, and exfiltrate data using Rclone software.
Cybereason GSOC has observed threat actors transitioning from BazarLoader, Trickbot, and IcedID
to Bumblebee, which seems to be in active development and generally the loader of choice for
many threat actors.
We have previously analyzed the loader in detail, and the report is available here. In this research,
we chose to focus on post-exploitation actions and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

Initial Access and Execution
Cybereason GSOC team observed the following distribution method to deliver the Bumblebee
malware:
A spear phishing email is received containing an archive or a link to an external source to
download the archive.
User extracts the archive and mounts the resulting ISO image.
The content of the mounted ISO image is a LNK file executing the Bumblebee payload upon
user interaction:

Bumblebee infection flow
Bumblebee operators host malicious websites that implement a drive-by download. To infect the
system, an end-user has to first manually decompress the archive containing the ISO file, mount
the file and then execute the Windows shortcut (LNK).
The LNK file has an embedded command to run Bumblebee Dynamic-link library (DLL) using
odbcconf.exe Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBin) and response (.rsp) file. The file [Bumblebee
specific name].rsp has the reference to the Bumblebee DLL:

Bumblebee DLL is executed using odbcconf.exe -f [Bumblebee specific name].rsp in the LNK file
target property. [Bumblebee specific name].rsp has a reference to [Bumblebee specific name].dll
which is the Bumblebee payload

Foothold
After the initial infection, Bumblebee injects code into multiple processes in order to establish a
strong foothold on infected endpoints. The process odbcconf.exe creates local Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) calls to spawn new processes.
As a result, the following two processes are spawned from wmiprivse.exe (Windows Management
Instrumentation Provider Service) :
wabmig.exe (Microsoft contacts import tool) with injected Meterpreter agent code (Meterpreter
agent is a security product used for penetration testing and provides remote control
capabilities).
wab.exe (Microsoft address book application) with an injected Cobalt Strike beacon:

Privilege Escalation and Cobalt Strike deployment
Bumblebee performs privilege escalation by loading an exploit for CVE-2020-1472 (Zerologon) into
rundll32.exe:

Exploitation of CVE-2020-1472, Zerologon as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Bumblebee uses a User Account Control (UAC) bypass technique to deploy post exploitation tools
with elevated privileges on infected machines. The method uses fodhelper.exe which is a trusted
binary, meaning Windows 10 won't show a UAC window when launched into execution:

Defense Platform

7/21

Fodhelper.exe is used to run "cmd.exe" /c rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\Cisco\[Cobalt
strike].dll”,MainProc where [Cobalt strike].dll is a Cobalt Strike framework beacon and MainProc is
the exported function to run.
Cobalt Strike is an adversary simulation framework with the primary use case of assisting red team
operations. However, Cobalt Strike is also actively used by malicious actors for conducting postintrusion malicious activities. Cobalt Strike is a modular framework with an extensive set of features
that are useful to malicious actors, such as command execution, process injection, and credential
theft.

Credential Theft
After obtaining system privileges on the infected machine, Bumblebee performs credential theft
using two methods detailed below.
First method used is Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory dump.
On Windows systems domain, local usernames and passwords are stored in the memory space of
the LSASS process. Bumblebee dumps the memory of this process using procdump64.exe to
access the sensitive information:

The second method of credential theft that Bumblebee operators use is registry hive extraction
using reg.exe:
HKLM SAM: The Security Account Manager (SAM) database is where Windows stores
information about user accounts.
HKLM Security: Local Security Authority (LSA) stores user logins and their LSA secrets.
HKLM System: Contains keys that could be used to decrypt/encrypt the LSA secret and SAM
database:

Bumblebee operators process retrieved credentials offline, attempting to extract cleartext
passwords. The time between credentials theft and the next activity is approximately 3 hours.

Reconnaissance
After the attackers gain a foothold in the organization network, they gather information in various
ways. We have observed attackers using tools such as nltest, ping, netview, tasklist and Adfind to
collect wide information related to the organization. The attackers collect information such as the
domain names, users, hosts and domain controllers.
AdFind (named “af.exe”) is a publicly available tool for querying Active Directory and has been used
by multiple threat actors:

10/21

Bumblebee executed multiple reconnaissance commands as seen in the Cybereason Defense
Platform
During the reconnaissance phase, Bumblebee operators contacted more than 200 IP addresses
and domain names within the organization. The most notable ones are Microsoft Exchange,
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) servers.

Lateral Movement
Bumblebee uses a Cobalt Strike agent for lateral movement. We can see multiple connections from
the process to internal addresses on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on TCP port 3389:

Platform
Following the lateral movement, the attacker persists on the organization network using the remote
management software “any desk”:

Platform

Active Directory Compromise
After the attacker obtains a highly privileged user and its password, the attacker accesses the
shadow copy. Shadow Copy is a technology included in Microsoft Windows that can create backup
copies or snapshots of computer files or volumes.
Bumblebee accesses the remote Active Directory machines using Windows Management
Instrumentation command-line utility (WMIC) and creates a shadow copy using vssadmin
command. In addition, the attacker steals the ntds.dit file from the domain controller.
The ntds.dit file is a database that stores Active Directory data, including information about user
objects, groups and group membership. The file also stores the password hashes for all users in
the domain:

13/21

Bumblebee creates shadow copies on remote Active Directory server and exfiltrates Ntds.dit as
seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
The following are the commands related to credential theft used to escalate privileges on the Active
Directory:
​wmic /node:"[Active Directory IP address]" /user:"[Compromised user name]" /password:"
[Compromised user password]" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C:
2>&1"
wmic /node:"[Active Directory IP address]" /user:"[Compromised user name]" /password:"
[Compromised user password]" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >>
c:\log.txt"
type \\[Active Directory IP address]\c$\log.txt

14/21

wmic /node:"[Active Directory IP address]" /user:"[Compromised user name]" /password:"
[Compromised user password]" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?
\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy635\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit
c:\ProgramData\nt & copy \\?
\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy635\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM
c:\ProgramData\nt & copy \\?
\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy635\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY
c:\ProgramData\nt"
7za.exe a -mx3 nt.7z \\[Active Directory IP address]\c$\ProgramData\nt
In order to obtain maximum privileges on the Active Directory domain, the threat actor:
Creates a shadow copy of the machine file’s volume
Lists all available shadow copies and stored the result in a file.
Copies the Active Directory database (ntds.dit) as well as registry hives containing credentials
and sensitive data from the shadow copy.
Compress the output directory for exfiltration.

Account Creation and Data Exfiltration
The threat actor uses a domain administrator account obtained previously to move laterally on
multiple systems. After initial connection, they create a local user and exfiltrate data using Rclone
software.
User creation commands are as follows :
net user [Attacker created username] P@ssw0rd!1 /add
net localgroup Administrators [Attacker created username] /add
