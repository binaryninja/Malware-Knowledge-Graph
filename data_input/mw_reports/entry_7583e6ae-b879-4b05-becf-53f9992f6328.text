Welcome back to The Underground Economist: Volume 2, Issue 24, an intelligence focused
blog series illuminating dark web findings in digestible tidbits from our ZeroFox Dark Ops
intelligence team. The Dark Ops team scours the dark web, extending visibility and
engagement into places traditional security teams can’t reach to share meaningful and
insightful intelligence on the trends and tactics threat actors are leveraging across the dark
web and criminal underground. Here’s the latest for the week of December 23, 2022.

Rebranded Ransomware-As-A-Service Project Advertised
Untested threat actor “nebel” advertised what they claim is a new ransomware-as-a-service
(RaaS) project, dubbed “Nevada,” on the Russian language Dark Web forum “RAMP.”
Despite the actor’s claims the project is new, ZeroFox researchers assess this is likely a
rebranded version of an older RaaS project, dubbed “Luna,” because the two have nearly
identical features, including:
Written in Rust

1/5

Uses AES and ECC encryption
Works on systems running Windows, Linux, and ESXI
Controlled via administrator panel
Contains real-time chat to negotiate with victims
Like the old project, the actor refuses to work with English-speaking threat actors. They also
offered to split any successful ransom payments 85 to 15 in favor of affiliates, which is
notable because most ransomware developers typically offer affiliates a smaller cut of the
profits.
ZeroFox researchers assess the actor likely rebranded the initial “Luna” RaaS project
because it failed to attract affiliates, indicating it is highly likely that there is a lull in interest
from threat actors in the current ransomware market.

Actor Sells Access To ATM Management Software For Unnamed
European Bank
In early December 2022, untested threat actor “theskull77” sold access to the ATM
management software for an unnamed European bank on the predominantly Russian
language forum “Exploit.” The alleged deal would allow threat actors to exploit a SQL
injection vulnerability to steal sensitive data from the backend of the bank’s ATM network,
including the balances and locations of various ATM machines. The actor said that operators
can also restart the ATMs, which would likely allow a skilled threat actor to compromise the
machines with malware and steal cash from the devices.

The asking price for the access started at $100,000 USD, indicating the alleged buyer would
likely expect to net a significant return on their investment.
ZeroFox researchers assess the actor is credible because they agreed to use the forum’s
escrow service, which would require them to deposit funds before a deal was brokered.

Threat Actors Abusing Malware Loader Developed As Penetration
Testing Tool
New and untested threat actor “DarkBLUP” advertised a malware loader dubbed “Ares” on
the Russian language Dark Web forum “RAMP.” ZeroFox researchers assess this loader is
likely a legitimate penetration testing tool that is now being abused by threat actors. This is
because of a similar project, dubbed “Project Ares,” was previously uploaded to GitHub as a
proof-of-concept (PoC) by the well-regarded user and red teamer “CerberSec.”
The loader mimics legitimate software to trick victims into the executing malware with
administrator rights on their machines.. Additional features of the loader include:
Written in C/C++
Supports 64-bit payloads
Makes it look like malware spawned by another process
Prevents non-Microsoft signed binaries from being injected into malware
Hides suspicious imported Windows APIs
Leverages anti-analysis techniques to avoid reverse engineering
The actor had ten licenses available for $300 USD per month.

3/5

Bundle Contains Exploits For Unpatched Vulnerabilities In Different
Services
Well-regarded and established threat actor “LORD1” advertised a bundle containing exploits
for unpatched vulnerabilities in different services, including Fortinet, Windows, Linux,
Atlassian Bitbucket, VMware, and Oracle, on the predominantly Russian language Deep
Web forum “Exploit.” The alleged exploits impact various remote code execution (RCE)
vulnerabilities, tracked as:
CVE-2022-40684 (Fortinet)
CVE-2022-36804 (Atlassian Bitbucket)
CVE-2021-39144, CVE-2022-31675, CVE-2022-22960 (VMware)
CVE-2022-21497, CVE-2021-35587 (Oracle)
Additionally, the bundle contains exploits for several undisclosed local privilege escalation
(LPE) vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux.
The actor charged $4,000 USD for the bundle. They also had exploits for unpatched
vulnerabilities in Veeam and Apache. The actor did not specify a price for these exploits.
ZeroFox researchers assess the sale of this bundle would likely lower the barrier to entry for
threat actors because the exploits come with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and
an integrated post-exploitation toolkit.
