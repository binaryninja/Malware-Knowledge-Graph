Summary
Highlights of Q1 2021 include:


The number of attacks increased by 17% compared to Q1 2020, and compared
to Q4 2020, the increase was 1.2%, with 77% being targeted attacks. Incidents
involving individuals accounted for 12% of the total.



Ransomware is still the malware that is most often used by attackers. In Q1, they
demanded astronomical ransoms and refined their arsenal, including adding
new ways to hide from security tools. There is a lot of new ransomware, for
example, Cring, Humble, and Vovalex. And the good old WannaCry is running
rampant again. Ziggy operators set a precedent: they returned the ransoms
paid to the victims and "turned to the light side".



The most popular vulnerabilities for attackers this quarter were breaches in the
Microsoft Exchange Server software (ProxyLogon) and the outdated file sharing
program Accellion FTA. Attackers used a zero-day vulnerability discovered
in SonicWall VPN solutions not just to hack the company, but also to launch
attacks on its customers. SonicWall presumably failed to notify its customers
in time about the identified vulnerability or a need to implement protective
measures. The incident supports the argument that software manufacturers
should inform their customers as soon as possible about existing vulnerabilities
and ways of protecting themselves until a patch is released.



More and more cybercriminals are developing malware to conduct attacks
on virtualization environments, and some are aggressively trying to exploit
vulnerabilities already found in software for deploying virtual infrastructure.
At the beginning of 2021, our security engineers helped to eliminate critical
vulnerabilities in VMware products. We strongly recommend installing the
security updates as soon as possible.



The number of attacks targeting IT companies has remained consistently high
for a second quarter in a row. In 15% of cases during Q1 2021, hackers targeted
IT companies to conduct an attack on their customers or to steal customer
data. At the beginning of 2021, there were still reports in the media about new
victims of the attack on SolarWinds: the company's customers claim that their
networks have been compromised.



Telecom companies were twice as likely to be attacked as in Q4 2020. In 71%
of the attacks, hackers aimed at obtaining data, with a particular interest in
the 5G technology. Nine out of ten incidents saw attackers use malware—most
frequently, RATs, which accounted for 55% of all attacks.

To protect from cyberattacks, follow our general recommendations for ensuring
personal and corporate cybersecurity. Also, given the specifics of the attacks in
the past quarter, we strongly recommend that you install security updates in a
timely manner and pay special attention to protecting virtual infrastructure. You
can strengthen security at the corporate perimeter by using modern security tools,
for example, web application firewalls for protecting web resources. To prevent
malware infection, we recommend using sandboxes to analyze the behavior of files
in a virtual environment and detect malicious activity.

Statistics
The number of incidents in Q1 2021 increased by 17% compared to the same
period in 2020, and compared to Q4 2020, increase was 1.2%, with 88% of the
attacks targeting organizations. Cybercriminals typically attacked government
institutions, industrial companies, research and education institutions. The main
motive for attacks on both organizations and individuals remains acquisition of
data. Attackers' main targets are personal data and credentials, and attacks on
organizations are also aimed at stealing intellectual property.

Elusive malware
Ransomware is predictably the most popular type of malware. Its share, among
other malware used in attacks on organizations, increased by seven percentage
points compared to Q4 2020 and is now 63%. Emailing remains the prevailing
method of delivering malware: attackers used it in six out of ten malware attacks
on organizations. Individuals are still most often attacked by banking trojans,
spyware, and malware that provides remote access to the device.

Figure 8. Methods used for malware distribution

Malware developers continue to look for new ways of bypassing security measures.
To achieve that goal, attackers, for example, use unpopular programming
languages, as in the case of BazarBackdoor (RAT), which was rewritten in Nim;
the ransomware operators of Vovalex and RobbinHood chose such uncommon
languages as D and Golang, respectively, from the get-go.
Some attackers have upgraded their tools with features that erase traces of
malicious activity—as seen in such miners as OSAMiner, Black-T and Pro-Ocean.
The code of the OSAMiner cryptominer, which targets macOS-based devices,
contains a function that allows killing the Activity Monitor process, along with other
monitoring and antimalware tools. Activity Monitor is the Mac equivalent of Task
Manager. The Black-T miner, which targets Unix systems, clears bash history after

8

deploying its payload and erases all traces of its own activity. The added openly
accessible function for hiding the process is called libprocesshider; if detected, it
may lead security experts to assume the presence of a malicious load. This tool is
also used by attackers who distribute the Pro-Ocean miner, which attacks Apache
ActiveMQ, Oracle WebLogic, and Redis servers, and checks the target environment
before installation. At this stage, it determines whether to hide the malware, and
if, for example, the malware finds itself in the Tencent Cloud or Alibaba Cloud
environment, it starts the process of deleting monitoring agents.
Another way to hide the destructive load is to split the malware into archives. An
example is the Masslogger trojan designed to collect credentials. Attackers use email
to deliver the malware, and to bypass the security measures, they split the executable
file into multivolume archives with such extensions as .r00, .r01, and so on.
Having analyzed the latest attacks by the RTM APT group, the PT ESC team found
that the attackers were using packers as a service to bypass security tools. This
approach greatly complicates a search for known signatures, but behavioral
analysis of files in the sandbox allows detecting malicious activity. In addition, the
use of cryptors does not affect interaction between the malware and management
servers, which means that they can be detected by analyzing network traffic.

A cryptor (packer)
Is a program that uses cryptographic methods to package malware in order
to hide it from security tools during signature analysis.

Figure 9. Phishing email from the RTM group that mimics a warning from bailiffs

Since the beginning of 2021, RTM has added the Quoter ransomware to their
arsenal. According to researchers, if the banking trojan has failed to complete its
tasks and collect information from the infected host, the attackers launch Quoter
onto the company's network as Plan B. Following the example of other ransomware
operators, RTM employs the strategy of double extortion in their attacks. The
group still uses social engineering methods as the main method of delivery, sending
phishing emails to victims.
The group's activity in Q1 2021 decreased compared to Q4 2020, but this may
indicate that the attackers are busy developing new attack techniques or refining
existing tools for now.

Ransoms keep going up
Every third attack in Q1 involved ransomware operators. At the end of 2020,
healthcare was the most frequently attacked sector, but in Q1 2021, the first place
was shared by industrial, scientific and educational organizations. They amounted
to 30% of all incidents involving ransomware; 28% of the attacks were directed at
governmental and medical institutions.
In about seven out of ten ransomware attacks on organizations, email was used as
a method of delivering the malware, and in a quarter of cases, attackers exploited
vulnerabilities and searched for unprotected resources accessible from the Internet.

New players appearing on the scene
In early 2021, several new ransomware programs appeared: Cring, Vovalex, Babuk
Locker, Phoenix CryptoLocker, Hog, and Humble.

Hog
Hog is currently targeting individuals. Its operators decrypt the victims'
devices only if they connect to their Discord server. The use of Discord
was previously seen in other hackers' attacks and is becoming a frequent
practice. Hog operators could be testing new techniques.

11

Astronomical ransoms
In Q1 2021, REvil operators broke all records in ransom demands. They demanded
$50 million after attacking the IT company Acer, and, after encrypting the network
of the pan-Asian retail chain Dairy Farm Group, demanded 30 million in exchange
for a decryptor and nondisclosure of the stolen data. Such large amounts are due to
the ask-more-to-get-more tactic. The incident with the retailer FatFace speaks to
the success of the campaign. In early January, Conti (Ryuk) operators penetrated
the company's network by conducting a phishing attack, and after seven days of
reconnaissance, extracted 200 GB of data and started the encryption process.
Initially, the attackers demanded $8 million. However, during the negotiations, the
amount was reduced to 2 million, which satisfied both parties.
Due to the fact that some companies refuse to pay the ransom, ransomware
operators are forced to come up with new tactics. These days, if the company is
refusing to pay, the attackers threaten to report the attack and the data theft to its
customers. The fraudsters expect that the customers will persuade the company
to pay a ransom to prevent the disclosure of their data.

Old players making a comeback
The WannaCry ransomware that thundered around the world four years ago is
back in the game. According to Check Point, the number of affected organizations
in March 2021 increased fortyfold compared to October 2020. The malware is
being distributed using the EternalBlue exploit. The extortionists mostly attack
government institutions and defense contractors, while the industrial sector ranks
second, and financial organizations and medical institutions rank third and fourth,
respectively.

New features
REvil has acquired a new feature: the ability to run the encryption process in
Windows safe mode, which enables the malware to bypass security measures.
Conti (Ryuk) developers have supplemented it with the ability to spread to other
devices within the domain. It is distributed over the network through shared
network resources, where it creates copies of itself, and files are launched by
creating tasks in the Windows task scheduler.

Secure storage of stolen data
DarkSide operators, who attacked the Brazilian electric power company Companhia
Paranaense de Energia (Copel), stealing about 1 TB of sensitive information,
use their own method of data storage. They do not store stolen information on
specially created private websites, as this is not safe. Instead, they have developed
a distributed database: the data is stored on different servers. This helps to limit
the number of individuals who can look at the data and avoid losing access to
stolen information due to possible blockages.

12

Figure 12. DarkSide ransomware tool detected using PT Sandbox

Fear of liability
Ziggy operators, in the wake of the news about the capture of the attackers who
distributed Netwalker and the destruction of the Emotet botnet infrastructure by
law enforcement agencies, announced the end of their hacking career and promised
the victims who paid them a ransom to return the money.

Insecure software
The first quarter of 2021 will be remembered for aggressive exploitation of
vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange Server software (ProxyLogon vulnerabilities)
and Accellion FTA. The ProxyLogon vulnerabilities were exploited by distributors of
the Black Kingdom and DearCry ransomware tools, Lemon_Duck cryptocurrency
miner operators, and other APT groups.
Vulnerabilities in the outdated Accellion FTA data transfer software were exploited
by Clop operators and the cybercriminal group FIN11: about 100 organizations were
affected. About a quarter of these organizations suffered from major data breaches:
the Singapore-based mobile operator Singtel, law firm Jones Day, universities
in Miami and California, U.S. Bureau of Shipping, rail operator CSX, and aircraft
manufacturer Bombardier. Centene, which was also affected by the vulnerabilities,
filed a lawsuit against Accellion. The claim demands reimbursement of expenses
associated with recovering from the attack.
The vulnerability CVE-2015-1427 in Elasticsearch allows attackers to bypass the
sandbox protection mechanism and execute arbitrary commands. This quarter, it
was used by operators of three botnets: z0Miner, Skidmap, and WatchDog. Another
botnet, FreakOut, expanded with the help of vulnerabilities in TerraMaster (CVE-202028188), Zend Framework (CVE-2021-3007), and Liferay Portal (CVE-2020-7961).
Speaking of vulnerabilities, we cannot fail to mention the incident with SonicWall,
the manufacturer of information security systems, which was hacked via a zero-day
vulnerability in the NetExtender and Secure Mobile Access VPN products in late

13

January. It was followed by media reports of attacks on the company's customers
who were using the vulnerable solutions. For example, this opportunity was used
by the UNC2447 group, which distributes the FiveHands ransomware (an updated
version of DeathRansom) through the WarPrism loader or the SombRAT backdoor.
According to researchers, the attackers were exploiting the vulnerability even before
a security update appeared. Presumably, SonicWall did not alert its customers on
time to the identified breach or a need to take protective measures.

Targeting virtual infrastructure
Q4 2020 saw a trend for attackers gearing their malware toward attacks on virtual
infrastructure, and in Q1 2021, this trend consolidated. We can link this primarily to
the global process of moving corporate IT infrastructure into a virtual environment.
Attackers carefully monitor information about new vulnerabilities and try to find a
use for these in their attacks as soon as possible. In early 2021, our experts helped
to eliminate several critical vulnerabilities in VMware products, including CVE2021-21972 in vCenter Server, which allowed remote code execution. At the time
of publication, we estimate that the number of devices vulnerable to CVE-202121972 worldwide exceeded 6,000. After the vendor's security updates appeared in
early February and the bulletin was published, Bad Packets researchers discovered
multiple network scans conducted to find vulnerable hosts.
Darkside, RansomExx, and Babuk Locker operators are aggressively exploiting other
vulnerabilities in VMware products to encrypt data stored on virtual hard drives, such
as the remote code execution vulnerabilities CVE-2019-5544 and CVE-2020-3992.

Figure 13. Offer of access to networks using VMware ESXi

Attackers who distribute the Hildegard trojan purposefully attack Kubernetes
environments. To hide their malware, they use several techniques at once, including
encrypting the payload, masking the malicious process as the bioset process in
Linux and using the Dynamic Linker Hijacking technique.

14

Figure 14. Ad for virtual or cloud infrastructure hacking services

Gaining access to virtual infrastructure and cloud services is a fairly popular topic
on the darkweb. The services of so-called brokers are also used by ransomware
operators for acquiring credentials to log in to the systems. In addition to ready-touse access to certain companies, attackers post offers to hack companies to order
on darkweb message boards.

Targeting software developers
and cloud services
The number of attacks on IT companies has not decreased since the beginning
of Q4 2020. The main motive of hackers attacking this industry is to obtain data
(66%). In 27% of the incidents, hackers sought financial gain, and in 15% of the cases,
companies were hacked to facilitate subsequent attacks on their customers.
The consequences of the attack on SolarWinds were evident still even in early
2021. Thus, in early March, news about the attack on the IT company Robotron
appeared in the media. The incident also affected the company's customers who
installed malicious updates for the Werkzeugkasten backup server. The investigation
revealed that the company's network was compromised as a result of the attack
on SolarWinds. According to Robotron, the first victim to install malicious updates
was a small company in the Netherlands (neither the name nor even the industry
in which the company operates were disclosed). Under the guise of updates, the
BlockKopieren ransomware was distributed.
Supply chain attacks did not spare information security companies. In early February,
the French company Stormshield reported that its systems had been hacked.
Attackers compromised the technical support portal. As a result of the incident, the
source code of the Stormshield Network Security software firewall was stolen. It can
be assumed that the attackers will examine the stolen code to find vulnerabilities
in the software. In early January 2021, Malwarebytes, which produces information
security tools, suffered due to a vulnerability in an application that has privileged
access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure. Note that in half of the attacks on this
industry, attackers exploited software vulnerabilities.
Ransomware operators were involved in 56% of the malware attacks. The most
significant incidents in terms of consequences occurred with the American IT

15

service provider CompuCom and the Canadian IoT solution provider Sierra Wireless.
In the first case, due to the attack using the DarkSide ransomware, the company
suspended the provision of services to some customers. The company estimates
that it will have to spend up to $20 million to eliminate all of the consequences, and
the expected loss of revenue ranges from 5 to 8 million. Sierra Wireless, which was
also affected by the ransomware attack, was forced to stop production, and the
company's website was unavailable for two weeks. In addition, the company had to
withdraw its financial forecast for Q1 2021, as it now needs to be adjusted.

Figure 15. Malware types used in attacks on IT companies

The share of RATs increased by 23 percentage points compared to Q4 2020. In one
of the campaigns, the attackers distributed it under the guise of Xcode, a free IDE
for the Apple ecosystem. SentinelOne researchers discovered this malware in the
legitimate project TabBarInteraction. The campaign is aimed at developers who will
then inadvertently distribute remote control malware to their clients as part of the
project. Another attack aimed at software developers involved hacking the official
PHP Git repository and adding malicious commits. It is noteworthy that the attackers
managed to add well-known developers' signatures to the commits.
Popular cloud services that facilitate interaction and simplify companies' IT
infrastructure also became a favorite target for attackers. The reason for this
phenomenon is that by attacking a cloud service provider, hackers can gain access
to the customers' data, as it happened, for example, during the January incident
with the Bonobos clothing store. The store suffered a data leak due to an attack on
the cloud service provider that the company used to store customer credentials and
personal data. A similar incident occurred with the network equipment manufacturer
Ubiquiti.
According to the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,
hackers managed to find a way to bypass two-factor authentication to compromise
cloud services. This was achieved through a "pass the cookie" attack.

Pass the cookie
In this type of attack, attackers intercept the session of an already
authenticated user or use stolen session cookies to authenticate with a web
resource.

Figure 16. Number of attacks on telecom companies

In 71% of the attacks, the attackers pursued the motive of obtaining data. The 5G
technology turned out to be a really interesting topic for hackers, perhaps due to
the fact that they want to understand the features of its implementation in order to
subsequently conduct attacks on subscribers. As part of a major cyberespionage
campaign, hackers created a fake website that mimics Huawei's official job portal.
Upon visiting this resource, a malicious Flash application was installed on the victim's
computer, which acted as a loader for a subsequent installation of Cobalt Strike
Beacon. At least 23 telecommunications companies fell prey to this campaign.
In early 2021, researchers from ClearSky reported on a campaign they identified,
which collected sensitive data. Conducted by the Volatile Cedar cybercrime group,
the campaign began in Q3 2020 and continues to this day. During the attacks,
hackers exploit the web vulnerabilities CVE 2019-3396 (Atlassian Confluence), CVE
2019-11581 (Atlassian Jira) and CVE 2012-3152 (Oracle Fusion). Among the victims
of this campaign were, for example, the American telecom company Frontier
Communications, the Egyptian mobile operator Vodafone Egypt, the Israeli National
Information Technology Center, as well as the telecom companies Mobily and
Saudinet in Saudi Arabia, and other major companies in the industry.

Malware was used in 91% of the attacks. Most of the incidents (55%) involved RATs,
as in the case of USCellular. This fact may indicate that access to telecom companies
is of high value to hackers: it can be sold on a darkweb forum or used in further
attacks on subscribers.

Governmental institutions are
the most frequently attacked
organizations
Since 2017, governmental institutions have topped our rankings of the most
frequently attacked organizations. For their malicious actions, hackers mainly
used malware (63% of attacks) and social engineering techniques (56%). The
exploitation of web vulnerabilities ranks third: the share of this method (22%)
increased by 13 percentage points compared to Q4 2020. Most often, attackers
exploited vulnerabilities that were popular in Q1 2021, such as the ProxyLogon
vulnerability used, for example, in the incident with the Norwegian parliament
and a vulnerability in Accellion FTA, which affected the audit service of the state
of Washington. The APT groups LuckyMouse, Tick, and Calypso, which target
organizations in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including
governmental agencies, were also seen exploiting the ProxyLogon remote code
execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855). The purpose of these campaigns was
to obtain data.
The share of ransomware operators in attacks on governmental institutions is
increasing: they were found in 70% of malware attacks. In addition to ransomware,
attackers also used banking trojans (18% of malware attacks), RATs (13%), and
spyware (8%).

Figure 19. Ransomware attacks on governmental institutions (percentage of malware-related attacks)

In this context, we should note the February attack on smart city systems in India.
The Economic Times stressed that this is the first attack ever on the infrastructure of
a smart city. The ransomware operators demanded $646,000 for troubleshooting
the problems they created. An equally interesting example is the attack by the
hacker group Hotarus Corp, which managed to hack the network of the Ministry
of Economy and Finance of Ecuador and distribute their ransomware Ronggolawe
(AwesomeWare). The peculiarity of this ransomware is that it is written in PHP and
encrypts the files of the victim company's web applications. During this attack, the

credentials of more than 6,500 users were compromised, and sensitive information,
including emails and personal data of employees, was stolen.
Social engineering techniques were used in 56% of the incidents. For example, the
APT group SideWinder, whose activities were monitored by PT ESC, uses these to
deliver malware. Attacks by this group on governmental institutions in Southeast
Asia were recorded throughout Q1 2021. As the first step of the attacks, the hackers
attached a file with a .lnk extension a phishing email. If the user opened the file,
the mshta.exe utility ran, displaying a stub document to the victim to allay its
suspicions, while the main script deployed the trojan. This technique is used by
many APT groups that we talked about in Q2 2020 and Q3 2020.

About the research
In this quarterly report, Positive Technologies shares information on relevant global
cybersecurity threats. The information draws on our own expertise, the outcomes
of investigations, and data from authoritative sources.
We believe that the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to
reputational risks. The result is that even organizations that investigate incidents
and analyze activity of hacker groups are unable to do a precise count of threats.
This research aims to draw the attention of companies and common citizens who
concern themselves with the state of information security to the key motives
and methods of cyberattacks, and to highlight the main trends in the changing
cyberthreat landscape.
In this report, each mass attack—for example, when attackers send phishing emails
to multiple addresses—is counted as a single incident. Definitions of terms used in
this report are available in the glossary on the Positive Technologies site.
