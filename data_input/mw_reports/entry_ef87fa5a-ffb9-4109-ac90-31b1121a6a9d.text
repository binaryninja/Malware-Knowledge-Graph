Pulse Report:
New APT32 Malware Campaign
Targets Cambodian Government
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has discovered a new malware campaign targeting the Cambodian government using an
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-themed spearphish. Using Recorded Future RAT controller detections and
Network Traffic Analysis, Insikt Group identified new operational infrastructure that we attribute to the Vietnamese statesponsored threat activity group APT32, also known as OceanLotus. This assessment is also supported by the identification
of several Cambodian victim organizations communicating with this infrastructure, and aligns with previous campaigns
targeting these organizations.
History
Vietnam and Cambodia have a long history of conflict, dating back to the Sino-Vietnamese War of the 1970’s, when Vietnam
began retaliatory attacks on China’s “little brother,” Cambodia. In 2017, Vietnam started strengthening its cyber warfare capabilities
with the formation of APT32, which targeted ASEAN’s website during the 2017 annual summit, as well as targeting websites of
ministries or government agencies in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines.
In recent years, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia has deteriorated in part because of China’s Belt and Road
Initiatives (BRI) in the region. As Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has grown closer to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the
two have strengthened the partnerships between the two countries, pushing Vietnam out of critical regional cooperatives.
Chinese investments in Cambodia include critical infrastructure, joint military exercises in the South China Sea, and a new
property development just North of Ream Naval Base, strategically located on the Gulf of Thailand between Vietnam
and Cambodia.
New APT32 Infrastructure
In June 2020, Insikt Group reported on new APT32 operational infrastructure identified through a proprietary method of
tracking malware activity associated with APT32, such as METALJACK and DenisRAT. Using this same methodology, Insikt
Group has continued to identify new, active APT32 IP addresses and associated domains.
Insikt researchers discovered several samples that are a part of this campaign:
Sample 1: The first sample is delivered via a malicious document titled, “បញ្ជរី ាយនាមអនុពន
័ ធ
្ យោធាបរទេសនិងការិយាល័យសហប្រតិបត្តិ
ការយោធាប្រចាំកម្ពជ
ុ ា.docx~[.]exe”, which translates to “List of Foreign Military Attachments and Office of Military Cooperation in

Cambodia.docx~[.]exe”. This sample, likely delivered via spearphishing, is a self-extracting archive (SFX) containing four files:
1.

A legitimate executable signed by Apple (SoftwareUpdate.exe).

2. A related benign dynamic link library (DLL) file (SoftwareUpdateFiles.dll).

3. A malicious DLL (SoftwareUpdateFilesLocalized.dll).
4. A file named “SoftwareUpdateFiles.locale” containing encrypted shellcode.

Upon execution of the SFX, the Apple executable loads the benign DLL before loading the malicious DLL, which is stored
in the SoftwareUpdateFiles.Resources/en.lproj file path. The malicious DLL then extracts the encrypted shellcode from the
SoftwareUpdateFile.locale file and decrypts and executes it, while displaying a decoy document to the user (an Microsoft
Word document displaying an “activation error”), eventually loading the final payload.

This loading process matches APT32 activity previously reported by Insikt Group and Ahnlab in relation to an APT32
sample referencing the 2020 ASEAN Summit. Further analysis of these artifacts for identification of the malware family is
ongoing within Insikt Group and updates will be posted as more samples are analyzed.

Sample 2: A second sample, uploaded to a malware repository on October 22, 2020, uses this same loading process and
communicates with one of the identified C2 domains, cloud.bussinesappinstant[.]com.
In this sample, the SFX file is called “9_Programme_SOMCA-Japan_FINAL.docx~.exe”, likely in reference to the ASEAN Senior
Officials Meeting for Culture and Arts (SOMCA), indicating APT32’s continued interest in the targeting of ASEAN and other
member states.

Decoy document utilized in this campaign shows a blank agenda for the “Seventh Meeting of the ASEAN Plus Japan Senior Officials on Culture and Arts. (Source: Recorded Future)

This archive file drops the same “SoftwareUpdateFilesLocalized.dll” file seen in the previous sample. In addition to the TTP
(tactics, techniques, procedures) and infrastructure overlaps, the malicious DLLs linked to this latest sample share an identical
rich header and import hash seen in historical APT32 samples.
Insikt Group identified further evidence of targeting of Cambodia through several IP addresses assigned to a Cambodian
government organization regularly communicating with the APT32 C2 IP address 43.254.132[.]212.
Recorded Future recommends using the following indicators of compromise from this campaign for detection and defense
against this malware. Additionally, Insikt Group has provided a YARA rule for detection, below.
