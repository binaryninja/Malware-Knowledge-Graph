INTRODUCING

ROKRAT
A sophisticated malware campaign
targeting South Korean government
officials involved in reunification

THIS BLOG WAS AUTHORED BY WARREN MERCER AND PAUL RASCAGNERES
WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MATTHEW MOLYETT.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Talos is tracking an actor that uses
malicious documents using the Korean
language in order to compromise systems.
This actor is quick to cover their tracks
and very quickly cleaned up compromised
hosts used as Command and Control.
We finally identified a new campaign,
leveraging a malicious Hangul Word
Processor (HWP) document. After
analyzing the payload, we determined
the malware was a Remote Administration
Tool which we have named, ROKRAT.
This campaign started with a spear phishing email containing a malicious
attachment, the HWP document. One of the identified emails was sent from
the email server of Yonsei, a private university in Seoul. The address used
in the email was ‘kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr’ which is the contact email of the
Korea Global Forum where the slogan in 2016 was “Peace and Unification of
the Korean Peninsula” which gave more credit and legitimacy to the email.
The HWP document contained an embedded Encapsulated PostScript
(EPS) object. This is zlib compressed and trivial to obtain. The purpose
of the EPS is to exploit a well-known vulnerability (CVE-2013-0808) to
download a binary disguised as a .jpg file. This file is decoded and finally an
executable is launched, ROKRAT. This RAT has the added complexity that
the command and control servers are legitimate websites. The malware
uses Twitter and two cloud platforms, Yandex and Mediafire, apparently for
both C2 communications and exfiltration platforms. Unfortunately, these
platforms are difficult to block globally within organizations as their use can
be viewed as legitimate in most cases. Additionally, these 3 platforms all
make use of HTTPS connectivity making it much more difficult to identify
specific patterns or the usage of specific tokens.

SPEAR PHISHING CAMPAIGN
At right are examples of the emails used against
victims in South Korea.
The first email Talos discovered was the most
interesting. In this first sample, we observed the
attackers praising the user for accepting to join
a panel relating to the “Korean Reunification and
North Korean Conference”. The text in the email
explains that the receiver should complete the
document to provide necessary feedback. However,
this appears to be a fake conference. The closest
match we identified to any Unification conference
was held in January 2017 which was the NYDA
Reunification conference. The sender is ‘kgf2016@
yonsei.ac.kr’ which is the contact email of the
Korea Global Forum.
When we analyzed the email headers we were able
to determine the Sender IP was 165.132.10.103.
With a little magic from ‘nslookup’, we quickly
determined this to be part of the Yonsei University
network, the SMTP server in fact. We believe that
the email address was compromised and abused
by the attackers to send the email used in this
campaign.
The sample filename translates as ‘Unification
North Korea Conference _ Examination Documents’
which reinforces the text in the email about the
reunification conference. For an added bonus, the
attacker even suggests in the email that people
who completed the document would get paid a
‘small fee’. Perhaps the gift of embedded malware
is the payment.
The second email Talos analyzed had less effort
applied. The email was from a free Korean mail
service provided by Daum, Hanmail, showing
there was no attempt at trying to appear to be
from an official body or person compared with the
previous email. The subject was merely ‘Request
Help’ while the attachment filename was ‘I’m a
munchon person in Gangwon-do, North Korea’.

Examples of the emails used
against victims in South Korea.

We suspect the attacker is hoping the victim will
feel empathetic toward the sender as the Kangwon
Province (where Munch'ŏn is located) was
previously part of South Korea. The attachment
contains a story about a person called ‘Ewing Kim’
who is looking for help.
The email’s attachments are two different HWP
documents that were both leveraging same
vulnerability, CVE-2013-0808.

ROKRAT ANALYSIS
The RAT downloaded by the 2 HWP documents belong to the same family. The main difference between
the samples are the Command and Control capabilities. One of the samples analyzed only uses Twitter to
interact with the RAT while the second one uses Twitter as well as the cloud platforms: Yandex and Mediafire.
The Twitter tokens we were able to extract are the same in both variants. There is obvious ongoing effort to
add features to this RAT to allow for more sophisticated levels of attacks.

ANALYSIS FRUSTRATIONS!

FIGURE A

The ROKRAT author implements several
techniques typically seen to frustrate human
analysts and avoid sandbox execution.
First, the malware does not run on Windows XP
systems. It uses the GetVersion() API to get the OS
version. If the MajorVersion is 5 (corresponding
to Windows XP or Windows Server 2003), the
malware executes an infinite loop of sleep, as
shown in FIGURE A .

FIGURE B

Additionally, the malware checks the current running
processes in order to identify tools usually used by
malware analysts or within sandbox environments.
FIGURE B shows the code used to perform this task.
The malware checks the process names in use on
the victim machine. It compares if the executed
process name matches a partial name hardcoded
in the sample. Here is the complete list:
• “mtool” for VMWare
Tools

• “rocex” for Process
Explorer

• “llyd” for OllyDBG

• “vbox” for
VirtualBox

• “ython” for Python
(used by Cuckoo
Sandbox for
example)
• “ilemo” for File
Monitor
• “egmon” for
Registry Monitor
• “peid” for PEiD

© 2017 Cisco. All rights reserved.

• “iddler” for Fiddler
• “ortmo” for Portmon
• “iresha” for
Wireshark
• “rocmo” for Process
Monitor
• “utoru” for Autoruns
• “cpvie” for TCPView

talos-external@cisco.com | talosintelligence.com

page 6 of 11

If any of these processes are discovered running on the system during this phase of execution, the malware
jumps to a fake function which generates dummy HTTP traffic. Furthermore, we discovered that if the
malware is being debugged or if it was not executed from the HWP document (i.e. double clicking the binary),
or if the OpenProcess() function succeed on the parent process the fake function is called as well.
The purpose of this appears to be to generate network traffic to provide some level of feedback/discovery
during any dynamic analysis research. This could generate a seemingly ‘good’ indicator of compromise when
in fact it is merely fake traffic generated. The fake function performs connections to the following URLs:
• https://www[.]amazon[.]com/Men-War-PC/dp/B001QZGVEC/EsoftTeam/watchcom.jpg
• http://www[.]hulu[.]com/watch/559035/episode3.mp4

The Amazon URL displays
a WWII game called ‘Men
of War’ whilst the Hulu
URL attempts to stream a
Japanese anime show called
‘Golden Time’.
These URLs are not malicious;
the malware pretends to
navigate these locations.
The files do not exist during
the investigation and were
downloaded only if a malware
analyst tool is running on
the system. We believe these
URLs are used to attempt to
trick any analysis.

C&C INFRASTRUCTURE
ROKRAT uses a legitimate platform in order to communicate, receive orders and exfiltrate documents. In total, we
identified 12 hardcoded tokens used to communicate to these legitimate platforms all via their public APIs.
C C #1: T W I T T E R :

FIGURE C

The first CC discovered is Twitter. We identified
7 different Twitter API tokens hardcoded in the
sample (Consumer Key + Consumer Secret +
Token + Token Secret). The malware is able to
get orders by checking the last message on the
Twitter timeline. The order can be either execute
commands, move a file, remove a file, kill a
process, download, and execute a file. The RAT is
able to tweet also and the sent data is randomly
prefixed by one following 3 characters hardcoded
word:
SHA-TOM-BRN-JMS-ROC-JAN-PED-JHN-KIMLEETo perform these tasks, the malware uses the
official Twitter API, as seen in FIGURE C .
C C # 2 : YA N D E X :
The second CC is Yandex and more specifically
the Yandex cloud platform and the platform
allows the creation of disks in the Yandex cloud.
Concerning this CC, we identified 4 Yandex tokens
hardcoded in the sample. The API in FIGURE D is
used to download and execute files or to upload
stolen documents. The exfiltrated documents are
uploaded to:

FIGURE D

disk:/12ABCDEF/Document/
Doc20170330120000.tfs
Where “12ABCDEF” is a random hexadecimal ID
to identify the target and Doc20170330120000
contains the date.

CC #3: MEDIAFIRE:

FIGURE E

The last cloud platform used by the Remote
Administration Tool is Mediafire. This website is
used in the same way as Yandex with the purpose
being to use the file storage provided by Mediafire
in order to download and execute files or to upload
stolen information. See FIGURE E .
In this case, the malware author hardcoded
one account in the sample (email / password /
application ID).

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
SCREENSHOTS CAPTURE &
KEYLOGGER
Additionally, one of the samples is able to capture
screenshots of the infected system. To perform
this task, the developer used the GDI API, as
shown in FIGURE F.

FIGURE F

A keylogger is also present in the analyzed
sample. The SetWindowsHookEx() API is
used to retrieve the stroked keys and the
GetKeyNameText() API is used to retrieve a string
that represents the name of a key. In addition
to the key, the title of the foreground window is
stored in order to known where the infected user is
typing (by using the GetForegroundWindow() and
GetWindowText() API). See FIGURE G .

CONCLUSION

COVERAGE

This campaign shows us a motivated malware
actor. The usage of HWP (an application mainly
used in Korea) and the fact that emails and
documents are perfectly written in Korean suggests
that the author is a native Korean speaker.

Additional ways our customers can detect and
block this threat are listed below.

The RAT used during this campaign was
innovative, using novel communication channels.
ROKRAT uses Twitter and two cloud platforms
(Yandex and Mediafire) in order to give orders,
send files, and get files. This communication
channel is extremely hard to contain because
organizations often have legitimate uses of these
platforms. The malware includes exotic features
such as the fact that it performs requests to
legitimate websites (Amazon and Hulu) if the
sample is executed in a sandbox or if a malware
analyst tool is used. We assume the goal is to
generate incorrect reports and IOC.
This investigation shows us once again that South
Korean interests sophisticated threat actors.
In this specific case, the actor compromised a
legitimate email address of a big forum organized
by a university in Seoul in order to forge the spear
phishing email, which increased the chance of
success. We know that it was a success because
during our research we identified infected systems
communicating with the command & control
previously mentioned.
