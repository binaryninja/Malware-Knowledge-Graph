Executive Summary
In the recent past, a Fidelis XPS user reported seeing detections of what appeared to be botnet-related
malware. While that customer was protected, we at General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions
decided to take a closer look. The analysis of the malicious code revealed that it appeared to be
Andromeda but the delivery infrastructure looked interesting. Further telemetry from our sensors showed
that this server in China was also hosting and distributing many other malicious specimens. Analysis of
the data revealed a pattern in the filenames. Our analysts used this pattern to discover other systems
distributed across the globe serving up various botnet malware, so far assumed to be used in distinct
campaigns but clearly related in this case:
-

Andromeda
Beta Bot
Neutrino Bot
NgrBot/DorkBot

Analysis also showed how attackers continue to benefit from the use of globally-distributed hosting
providers to perform their malicious activities. Further, the analysis revealed how attackers are hosting
and distributing identical copies of the malware from servers in different countries including China,
Poland, Russia, and the United States.
For the period of time researched in this activity, we observed the following targeted sectors in the US:
-

Manufacturing / Biotechnology & Drugs
Professional Services / Engineering
Information Technology / Telecommunications
Government / State

Note that our footprint is largely in the Enterprise space and it is possible that we’re seeing spillover from
wider campaigns.
This document uncovers various servers hosting Bots and other related malware, provides a triage
analysis of various pieces of malware hosted by these malicious servers, and provides indicators that
network defenders can use to protect their networks.

Threat Overview
The threat activity observed in the past weeks against various targets in our customer base has shown
patterns that allowed us to discover multiple servers hosting and distributing malicious software (Bots).
As it is known by the network defenders and the security community, it is important to defend against
these attacks since systems infected with these malicious specimens could be used for credential theft,
Distributed Denial of Service Attacks, spreading malware, lateral propagation, etc. This is of great concern
as the first stage attack continues to bypass network security defenses infecting user’s computers that
beacon to malicious servers to download or create the second stage malware into the victim systems.
Some of the main Bot types of malware detected through this research include:
-­‐

Andromeda
Andromeda is a modular bot that downloads modules and updates from its command and control
(C&C) server during execution. The malware has both anti-VM and anti-reversing features. Its
code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for malware reverse engineers to analyze and
antivirus tools to detect.
Andromeda bot features include: self-propagation, injection into trusted processes to hide itself,
network traffic encryption, download and installation of files/malware, form grabber, keylogger,
ring3 rootkit, proxy, etc. Features like form grabber, rootkit, and proxy are delivered to the
malware in the form of modules that are then loaded into the victim system after the malware
makes a connection with its C&C. It appears that in 2012, some of the modules were sold for
$500 (form grabber), $300 (Ring3 rootkit), and $200 (keylogger).

-­‐

DorkBot/NgrBot
DorkBot is a modified IRCBot that is very similar in features to NgrBot. DorkBot has a loader and
a module. The bot includes the following features: process injection, hard drive wiping, etc.
Different from NgrBot, DorkBot uses modified IRC commands. Some of the commands supported
include: !die, !dl, !http.inj, !logins, !rc,!speed, !ssyn, !stop, !up, and !udp.
NgrBot can also be remotely controlled via Internet-Relay-Chat (IRC) protocol. It has capabilities
to join different IRC channels to perform various attacks according to the IRC-based commands
from the C&C server. Its code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for malware reverse
engineers to analyze and antivirus tools to detect.
NgrBot features include: self-propagation (e.g. through USB removable drives, social networking
sites, and messaging clients), process injection, hard drive wiping, blocking access to multiple
antivirus/security vendor websites, denial of service attacks, credentials stealing (usernames and
passwords), download and execute file, etc. Some of the commands supported are: ~pu, ~dw,
~http.inj, ~logins, ~rc, ~speed, ~ssyn, ~stop, and ~udp.

-­‐

Beta Bot
It is said that Beta bot started out as an HTTP bot. The Bot is also known by some security
vendors as ‘Trojan.Neurevt’. Its code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for malware reverse
engineers to analyze and antivirus tools to detect.
Beta bot features include: anti-VM and anti-reversing, self-propagation, rootkit, process injection,
blocking access to multiple antivirus/security vendor websites, AV-disabling, form grabbing,
download and execution of files, termination of competing malware communications by
terminating their processes or blocking their code injections, and denial of service. It appears that

in May 2013, the pre-built bot could be purchase for $320-$500, and $20 for variant rebuilds for
those requiring configuration changes. According to online research, Beta Bot sales are being
handled by “Lord Huron,” although “betamonkey” appears to be the author. The following image
was found during online research:

-­‐

Neutrino
The Neutrino bot was advertised as an HTTP stress-testing tool. It has some of the following
features: anti-VM and anti-reversing/debugging, denial of service (HTTP/TCP/UDP flood),
keylogger, command shell, credential stealing, self-spreading, etc. It appears at some point the
bot was sold for $550 (Builder), $200 (Full set including Bot and Admin Panel), and $20 (Update).
Online research revealed the following contact information for this bot: n3utrino@kaddafi[.]me /
n3utrino@xmpp[.]jp / n3utrino.blog[.]com. The following images were found during online
research:

Risk Assessment
A bot malware has features like anti-reversing, credential stealing/keystroke logging/form grabbing, DNS
changer, process injection, antivirus process killing, blocking of security related websites, backdoor, and
others. They also have features to spread themselves through USB removable drives, social networking
sites, and messaging clients. In addition, they could also infiltrate the network when the victim user visits
a website hosting a browser exploit.
Once the attacker gains control, the infected system could be used to launch Distributed Denial of Service
attacks, spread the bot to other victims, download more advanced malware to perform lateral
propagation, etc. The attackers (Bot Masters/Herders) could also rent their botnets to other
cybercriminals.

Indicators and Mitigation Strategies
