Introduction
During the first week of June 2019, Check Point researchers encountered a new, largescale phishing campaign targeting German companies across all industries. The hacker’s
goal was to install Remcos – a remote control tool – on the victims’ computers.

Attack Flow
The attackers initially sent fake emails that appeared to be from several legitimate
companies across Germany. These emails contained invoices or urgent order attachments
which were actually Remcos archives attempting to connect with the attacker’s command
and control (C&C) server.

The attachment is usually an archive containing an executable disguised as a PDF or other
document file. The disguise is a simple comma PDF extension and folder icon.

After the victim opens the file, Remcos executes silently and gives the attacker full control
over the victim’s machine.

Communication with the C&C
The attacker then covers his tracks by using DDNS (Dynamic DNS), a legitimate service for
mapping Internet domain names to dynamic IP addresses. Learn more about this wellknown evasion technique at: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1311/.
By using free DDNS accounts, the attacker has a large number of IP addresses at their
disposal and can use them to control the victims’ machines.
For example, the attacker uses https://www.noip.com/ service to create the domain
ablegod.hopto[.]org.

Remcos – a Swiss Army Knife RAT

Distributed and sold as a legitimate tool by a company called “Breaking Security” on a
public website, Remcos is an abbreviation for Remote Control and Surveillance and is sold
on a fremium model with a pro version priced from €58 – €389.
By using Remcos, the attacker can remotely gain full control of another machine and
include the following functions:
Bypass AV products and privilege escalation:
Gain admin privileges
Disable UAC (User Account Control)
Maintain persistence on the targeted machine
Run as a legitimate process (e.g. injection to Windows process)
Run in the background, invisible to the victim
Capabilities:
Keylogger and clipboard
ScreenLogger
Audio capture
Extract passwords
