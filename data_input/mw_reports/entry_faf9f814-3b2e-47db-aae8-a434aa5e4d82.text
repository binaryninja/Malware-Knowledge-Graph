Two members of the Carbanak (Cobalt) cybercrime group were sentenced today in a
Kazakhstan court to eight years in prison for stealing from Kazakhstan banks.
The sentencing was announced today by the Almaty city prosecutor’s office.
The two hackers, whose names were not released, were found guilty of hacking into the IT
systems of several Kazakh banks between 2016 and 2017, from where they stole more than
2 billion tenges ($4.6 million).
The stolen money was sent to 250 payment cards, which were then sent to Europe, and the
funds cashed out through ATMs across Russia, Germany, Czech Republic, Estonia, Spain,
Switzerland, Slovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Belgium, and France.
The hackers, which operated part of the Carbanak group, also failed in stealing 8 billion
tenges ($18.6 million), prosecutors said.
“The rest of the members of this criminal organization have been identified and are on the
international wanted list,” Kazakh officials added.

breach more than 100 banks in 40 countries around the world and stole more than $1 billion,
according to a Kaspersky investigation.

A first Carbanak member was arrested in March 2018 in Spain. Subsequent arrests followed
in August 2018 in Germany and Ukraine (two members), and all were extradited to the US to
face charges.
The suspect arrested in Germany, believed to be the gang’s leader, was sentenced to 10
years in April 2021.
The suspects sentenced today in Almaty now become the 5th and 6th Carbanak members to
face the music.
After the 2018 arrests, the Carbanak group splintered into smaller groups, which continued
to target the financial sector, and some also dabbled in ransomware; however, the group
stopped operating as a whole at its previous scale.
