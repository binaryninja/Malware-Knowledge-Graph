DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices for Preventing
Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-131a

Summary
This Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework, Version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat
actor tactics and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a critical infrastructure (CI)
entity—a pipeline company—in the United States. Malicious cyber actors deployed DarkSide
ransomware against the pipeline company’s information technology (IT) network.[1] At this
time, there is no indication that the entity’s operational technology (OT) networks have been
directly affected by the ransomware.
CISA and FBI urge CI asset owners and operators to adopt a heightened state of awareness
and implement the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this Joint
Cybersecurity Advisory, including implementing robust network segmentation between IT and
OT networks; regularly testing manual controls; and ensuring that backups are implemented,
regularly tested, and isolated from network connections. These mitigations will help CI
owners and operators improve their entity's functional resilience by reducing their
vulnerability to ransomware and the risk of severe business degradation if impacted by
ransomware.

(IOCs). Note: These IOCs were shared with critical infrastructure partners and network
defenders on May 10, 2021. The applications listed in the IOCs were leveraged by the
threat actors during the course of a compromise. Some of these applications might
appear within an organization's enterprise to support legitimate purposes; however,
these applications can be used by threat actors to aid in malicious exploitation of an
organization's enterprise. CISA and FBI recommend removing any application not
deemed necessary for day-to-day operations.

(Updated July 08, 2021): Click here for downloadable IOCs associated with a sample
of a DarkSide ransomware variant analyzed by CISA and FBI. Note: CISA and FBI
have no evidence that this sample is related to the pipeline incident detailed in this
CSA. This variant executes a dynamic-link library (DLL) program used to delete
Volume Shadow copies available on the system. The malware collects, encrypts, and
sends system information to the threat actor’s command and control (C2) domains and
generates a ransom note to the victim. For more information about this variant, refer to
Malware Analysis Report MAR-10337802-1.v1: DarkSide Ransomware.

Technical Details
Note: the analysis in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory is ongoing, and the information
provided should not be considered comprehensive. CISA and FBI will update this advisory
as new information is available.
After gaining initial access to the pipeline company’s network, DarkSide actors deployed
DarkSide ransomware against the company’s IT network. In response to the cyberattack, the
company has reported that they proactively disconnected certain OT systems to ensure
the systems’ safety.[2] At this time, there are no indications that the threat actor moved
laterally to OT systems.
DarkSide is ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)—the developers of the ransomware receive a
share of the proceeds from the cybercriminal actors who deploy it, known as
“affiliates.” According to open-source reporting, since August 2020, DarkSide actors have
been targeting multiple large, high-revenue organizations, resulting in the encryption and
theft of sensitive data. The DarkSide group has publicly stated that they prefer to target
organizations that can afford to pay large ransoms instead of hospitals, schools, non-profits,
and governments.[3],[4]
According to open-source reporting, DarkSide actors have previously been observed gaining
initial access through phishing and exploiting remotely accessible accounts and systems and
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) (Phishing [T1566], Exploit Public-Facing Application
[T1190], External Remote Services [T1133]).[5],[6] DarkSide actors have also been observed
using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain Persistence [TA0003].[7]
After gaining access, DarkSide actors deploy DarkSide ransomware to encrypt and steal
sensitive data (Data Encrypted for Impact [T1486]). The actors then threaten to publicly
release the data if the ransom is not paid.[8],[9] The DarkSide ransomware uses Salsa20
and RSA encryption.[10]
DarkSide actors primarily use The Onion Router (TOR) for Command and Control (C2)
[TA0011] (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy [1090.003]).[11],[12] The actors have also been observed
using Cobalt Strike for C2.[13]

Mitigations
CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations to reduce the
risk of compromise by ransomware attacks.
Require multi-factor authentication for remote access to OT and IT networks.
Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.
Filter emails containing executable files from reaching end users.
Implement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to
discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments
and re-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails.
Filter network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known
malicious IP addresses. Prevent users from accessing malicious websites by
implementing URL blocklists and/or allowlists.
Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT
network assets, in a timely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management
system; use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network assets
and zones should participate in the patch management program.
Limit access to resources over networks, especially by restricting RDP. After
assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating
sources and require multi-factor authentication.
Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets
using up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine
how OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.
Implement unauthorized execution prevention by:
Disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email.
Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files transmitted
via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.
Implementing application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute
programs known and permitted by security policy. Implement software restriction
policies (SRPs) or other controls to prevent programs from executing from
common ransomware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular
internet browsers or compression/decompression programs, including the
AppData/LocalAppData folder.
Monitor and/or block inbound connections from Tor exit nodes and other
anonymization services to IP addresses and ports for which external
connections are not expected (i.e., other than VPN gateways, mail ports, web
ports). For more guidance, refer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA20-183A:
Defending Against Malicious Cyber Activity Originating from Tor.
Deploy signatures to detect and/or block inbound connection from Cobalt
Strike servers and other post exploitation tools.

3/7

CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations now to reduce
the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their CI entity fall victim to a
ransomware attack in the future.
Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT
networks to limit the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT
network is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated
communication between the IT and OT networks.
Organize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality,
consequence, and operational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits
between the zones and deploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor
communications between zones. Prohibit industrial control system (ICS) protocols from
traversing the IT network.
Identify OT and IT network inter-dependencies and develop workarounds or
manual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections create risk
to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test contingency plans
such as manual controls so that safety critical functions can be maintained during a
cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at necessary capacity even if
the IT network is compromised.
Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or
OT networks need to be taken offline.

4/7

Implement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks.
Backup procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. The data backup
procedures should also address the following best practices:
Ensure that backups are regularly tested.
Store your backups separately. Backups should be isolated from network
connections that could enable the spread of ransomware. It is important that
backups be maintained offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and
encrypt or delete accessible backups. Maintaining current backups offline is
critical because if your network data is encrypted with ransomware, your
organization can restore systems to its previous state. Best practice is to store
your backups on a separate device that cannot be accessed from a network,
such as on an external hard drive. (See the Software Engineering Institute’s page
on ransomware).
Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event
they need to be rebuilt. This entails maintaining image “templates” that include
a preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that
can be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server.
Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary
system is not preferred. Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system
can present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.
Store source code or executables. It is more efficient to rebuild from system
images, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms
correctly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases.
Ensure user and process accounts are limited through account use policies,
user account control, and privileged account management. Organize access rights
based on the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.
If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, CISA and FBI recommend the
following actions:
Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and
disable the computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking
capabilities. Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired
or wireless.

5/7

Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from
the network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or
devices that shared a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully
encrypted by ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially
infected computers and devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any
computers that have been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers
and computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of
partially encrypted files by specialists. (See Before You Connect a New Computer to
the Internet for tips on how to make a computer more secure before you reconnect it to
a network.)
Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible,
scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.
Refer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: AA20-245A: Technical Approaches to
Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more best practices on incident
response.
Note: CISA and the FBI do not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a
ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other
criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities.
Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. CISA and
FBI urge you to report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office.
CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help CI organizations assess,
identify and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By requesting these
services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack
vectors.
