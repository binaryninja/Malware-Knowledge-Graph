Info Stealer Targeting Browsers and Crypto Wallets
The popularity of Cryptocurrency has increased exponentially over the recent years as dealing with
crypto has become relatively hassle-free and more accessible. The financial returns of crypto
investments have attracted many investors to invest in crypto markets.
As the demand for crypto investment has increased over the years, we can also see a corresponding rise
in the number of crypto wallets. Some popular crypto wallets such as Binance, Atomic, Exodus,
Coinbase, Metamask, and Trust are the most commonly used platforms to manage and transact
Cryptocurrency.
Despite gaining popularity worldwide, Cryptocurrency also has its downsides. It opens the door for
various malicious activities like phishing, scams, hacking, delivering malware, etc.

Cyble Research Labs has constantly been tracking malicious activities targeting Cryptocurrency wallets.
During a routine threat-hunting exercise, we came across a Twitter post where a researcher mentioned a
fake Atomic wallet site distributing Mars Stealer.
The phishing site “hxxp://atomic-wallet[.]net” uses the icon and name of the Atomic wallet. Additionally,
the Threat Actor is trying to copy the UI of a genuine website to trick the user, as shown in the below
image.

Upon investigating the phishing site, we observed that the TA has invested time in developing a welldesigned phishing site to trick victims into downloading the malware.
The phishing site appears to be genuine as the TA provided some attractive content such as Trusted
Reviews, Cashback, FAQ, Partners, Contact Us page, Support, and Update History.

When the user interacts with the “Download” button, the phishing site redirects to the download options
page, where the user can download Atomic wallet for Windows, iOS, and Android, as shown in the below
image.

Figure 3 – Download options for the user
The App Store button is inactive while, the Google Play button redirects the user to the genuine Atomic
Wallet Play Store link.
When the user clicks on the “Download for Windows” button, it connects to shortened URL
“hxxps://bit[.]ly/3PRDyH8” and downloads a Zip file named “Atomic Wallet.zip“.
After a detailed investigation, the downloaded file was identified as a Mars Stealer sample. Mars Stealer
was discovered in June 2021 and was available for sale on a few underground cybercrime forums. Mars
stealer primarily targets browser extensions, crypto extensions and wallets, and 2FA plugins.

Technical Analysis
The downloaded Zip file contains the “AtomicWallet-Setup.bat” file containing malicious code, as shown
in the below image.

Upon execution, the .bat file invokes the Powershell command, enabling the administrative elevation for
its execution.

The .bat file then copies powershell.exe into the current directory, renames it as
AtomicWallet_Setup.bat.exe, and then hides it using the attrib command.

Then, the .bat file executes PowerShell content using AtomicWallet_Setup.bat.exe, which further
decodes the base64-encoded content and decrypts it using an AES algorithm that stores a Gzip
Compressed stream in the memory.
The below figure shows the code used by the malware to perform AES decryption and GZip
Decompression.

Finally, the malware decompresses the GZip content and loads the final PowerShell code that downloads
Mars Stealer from the Discord server to the victim’s %LOCALAPPDATA% location.

Figure 8 – Downloading Mars Stealer from the Discord server
The below figure shows the infection chain of Mars Stealer. After downloading Mars stealer, the .bat file
deletes the “AtomicWallet_Setup.bat.exe” from the victim’s machine.

After successful installation, Mars Stealer steals sensitive information from the victim’s device and
exfiltrates the stolen data to the C&C server.

Conclusion
According to our research, the TAs behind Mars stealer are adopting sophisticated phishing attacks to
distribute Mars Stealer and gather user credentials, system information, and other sensitive data.
The criminals may use compromised credentials to carry out attacks to stay under the radar and avoid
tripping any security monitoring rules, thus alerting any victims to the attempted compromise.

Our Recommendations
Avoid downloading pirated software from unverified sites.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Keep updating your passwords after certain intervals.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.
Block URLs that could be used to spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
