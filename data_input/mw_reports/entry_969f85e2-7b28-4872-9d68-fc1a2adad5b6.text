Today we bring you Princess Locker; the ransomware only royalty could love. First
discovered by SenseCy on darkweb forums and later by Michael Gillespie through his IDRansomware platform, Princess Locker encrypts a victim's data and then demands a hefty
ransom amount of 3 bitcoins, or approximately $1,800 USD, to purchase a decryptor. If
payment is not made in the specified timeframe, then the ransom payment doubles to 6
bitcoins
Not much is known about Princess Locker other than having seen a few encrypted files and
ransom notes uploaded to ID-Ransomware. From what has been gather gathered, when a
person is infected, the ransomware will encrypt the victim's files and then append a random
extension to encrypted files and a unique ID is created for the victim. This ID, extension, and
encryption is then most likely sent up to the ransomware's Command & Control server.

Ransom notes are also created and displayed, which are named
!_HOW_TO_RESTORE_[extension].TXT
and !_HOW_TO_RESTORE_[extension].html.

These ransom notes contain the victim's ID and links to the TOR payment sites where a
victim can login to see payment information.

The Princess Locker Payment Site
The Princess Locker payment site is your standard ransomware site with no special
features. When victim's access the Princess Locker payment site they will be greeted with a
page asking them to select a language that looks almost identical to Cerber's language
selection page.

They will then be presented with a login prompt where they need to enter the victim ID
provided in the ransom note. Once logged in they will see the main payment site, which
contains information such as the ransom amount, the bitcoin address to send payment to,
and the answers to common questions.
The payment site also provides the ability to decrypt 1 file free. Unfortunately, since we do
not have a sample of the ransomware, and I didn't want to waste a victim's free decryption, I
do not know if this feature works or not.

The one item that is missing from the payment site is a support page that victim's can use to
contact the malware developers. If this ransomware goes into wider distribution, I would not
be surprised to see one added.
We are still actively looking for a sample of this ransomware, so if one is encountered, please
upload it here.

Reason, people will take it the wrong way, especially since this malware is irrelevant to
casuals.

It's funny that they use the term "fiat currency" in the payment instructions. Somehow I
imagine that most people don't know what that means.

Interesting..didn't notice. Not sure if I have seen that used before in relation to
ransomware.

Many girl-women regard themselves as princesses. Pop-gun for them. :)
