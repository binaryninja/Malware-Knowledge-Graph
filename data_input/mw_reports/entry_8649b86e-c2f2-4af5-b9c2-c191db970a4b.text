July 27, 2018

First observed in 2017, Luoxk is a malware campaign targeting web servers throughout Asia,
Europe and North America.
Luoxk uses a variety of methods to compromise vulnerable servers but is primarily exploiting
CVE-2018-2893, a remote code execution vulnerability on Oracle web servers. Open
Remote Desktop Protocol ports have also been used to infect devices.
The luoxk group registered the luoxkexp[.]com C2 domain on March 16,2017, and then
immediately started to use it – domain details here
Once access is achieved, the group operating Luoxk will use the compromised servers for a
number of purposes including:
Enrolling them in a Nitol variant botnet to be used for distributed denial-ofservice attacks. Nitol is a smaller botnet trojan that operates primarily in China and
surrounding Asian countries.
Installing the Gh0st remote access trojan, which in turn is used to install an
XMRig mining application and to propagate to other devices on the network.
Hosting malicious Android APK files for other malware to use.
The dns access traffic going to luoxkexp[.]com has been going up for the last few days.
