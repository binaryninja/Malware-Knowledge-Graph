(CNN) -- The SoBig.F computer virus -- which has already overwhelmed hundreds of
thousands of computers worldwide -- has become the fastest spreading virus ever
with experts warning the worst is yet to come.
Already the worm has caused an estimated $50 million of damage in the United States
alone.
Among its casualties: It briefly brought freight and computer traffic in Washington, D.C. to a
halt, grounded Air Canada and slowed down computer systems at many major companies
such as advanced technology firm Lockheed Martin.
The sixth or "F" version of the SoBig infection disguises itself in e-mails which once opened
scan a computer for e-mail addresses before sending scores of messages to the addresses
it collected via its own inbuilt sending program.
The SoBig.F outbreak, first detected Monday, began 10 days after the Blaster worm (which
itself infected an estimated 500,000 users) and has already beaten other infamous viruses
such as LoveBug, Klez and Kournikova in terms of spread.

The first SoBig variant was released in January.
U.S.-based e-mail security group MessageLabs says the virus originated and is most
prevalent in the United States.
"This is the most severe e-mail virus we've ever seen," MessageLabs' Josh White said.
"At its peak 1 out of 17 e-mails that we were processing was a copy of the SoBig.F virus.
Certainly we haven't seen numbers like this before. It is spreading at a very fast rate and the
volumes are high."
Internet service provider AOL (part of the AOL Time Warner group which includes CNN) says
it scanned 40.5 million e-mails and found the virus in more than half. SoBig accounted for 98
percent of all viruses found.
The e-mail-borne worm arrives with various subject headers, such as: Your details, Thank
you!, Re: Thank you!, Re: Details, Re: Re: My details, Re: Approved, Re: Your application,
Re: Wicked screensaver or Re: That movie.
The body of the message is short and usually contains either "See the attached file for
details" or "Please see the attached file for details."
Fooled that the e-mail is legitimate, the user opens the e-mail and triggers the worm, which
then goes hunting for addresses. The flood of messages it then sends are capable of
succumbing other users' inboxes or computer systems by the sheer volume of e-mails.

Worrying sign
The virus also implements a background program that turns an infected computer into a
relay system for further messages from the virus' creator.
This part of the virus has led many computer security experts to believe the virus was written
to try and beat spam filters.
Experts are predicting that though it will soon be brought under control, the infection is likely
to spike early next week as many people in Europe and the U.S. return to work from
(northern hemisphere) summer holidays to awaiting e-mail inboxes.
However, the worm is set to deactivate September 10 and halt further propagation. This itself
is a worrying sign.
"The SoBig virus writer's use of an inbuilt expiry date indicates he is committed to inventing
new and improved versions," MessageLabs' chief technology officer Mark Sunner said.
"Each variant released so far has exceeded the previous one in growth and impact during
the critical initial window of vulnerability."
