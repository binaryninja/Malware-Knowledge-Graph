REvil Master Key for Kaseya Attack Posted to XSS
Flashpoint analysts have identified a post on the Russian language XSS Forum in which a
threat actor operating under the alias of “Ekranoplan” posted a possible master key for REvil
in a screenshot on Github.[1] Thus far, Flashpoint analysts have been able to attribute this
key to restoration of data associated with the recent Kaseya ransomware attack, and are
exploring whether there is broader applicability. exploring whether there is broader

key to restoration of data associated with the recent Kaseya ransomware attack, and are

REvil (aka, “Sodinokibi” or “Sodin”) is a Russian ransomware extortionist threat group that is
responsible for several high-visibility ransomware incidents in recent months, including the
attack against technology provider Kaseya. While REvil was purportedly shut down in July
2021, many of their targets remain impacted by their activities, and other groups have
recently emerged that Flashpoint analysts assess as being related to REvil.
Ekranoplan shared a link to the screenshot on August 6, 2021. The user does not appear to
have any further posting history on the forum. Several users questioned the utility of a
screenshot in decrypting files, to which Ekranoplan answered in Russian, “This was provided
to us by our parent company and is supposed to work for all REvil victims, not just us.” While
the origins of Ekranoplan are unknown, no pun intended, Flashpoint analysts tested the
REvil decryptor. As one user in the thread highlighted, replacing the decryption key with this
key should work.
Flashpoint patched the decryptor binary with the annotated key from the thread, and
successfully decrypted a sandbox infected with the new REvil test sample, upon changing
the file extensions to “universal_tool_xxx_yyy” as seen in the screenshot. The files were
properly decrypted once the file extensions were renamed.

Similar to the Russian aircraft owing to Ekranoplan’s namesake, the user flew out of the
forum thread as quickly as they entered. The mystery still remains on the true reason for
REvil’s sudden disappearance. Whether their infrastructure was the target of a coordinated
law enforcement operation, the decryption key was leaked by a former victim, or a change of
heart from the REvil operators remains a point of conjecture. At this time, the outcome is the
same. Analysts will continue to monitor for changes in the ransomware ecosystem.
