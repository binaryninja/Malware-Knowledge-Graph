ADVERSARY INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT 2020:

A DEFENDER’S VIEW

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Background
Lead time in identifying malicious servers can be a proactive
measure in neutralizing threats. Before a server can be used by a threat
actor, it has to be acquired, either via compromise or legitimate purchase.
Then, the software must be installed, configurations must be tuned, and
files added to the server. The actors must access it via panel login, SSH,
or RDP protocols, and then expose the malware controller on a port to
allow the data to transfer from the victim and to administer commands
to infections. Only then can the server be used for malicious purposes.
However, in exposing, configuring, and accessing the server,
the adversary leaves behind their fingerprints; sometimes in software
deployed on the server, sometimes via the login panel, sometimes via
SSL registration patterns. This creates an opportunity for detection,
which can occur prior to a phishing email being sent or an implant getting
compiled.
Similarly, such a collection can illuminate many things about
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group® conducted a study of malicious command and
control (C2) infrastructure identified using proactive scanning methods throughout
2020. All data was sourced from the Recorded Future® Platform. Data in this report
is as of November 15, 2020.

adversaries. Seeing how many command and control (C2) servers are
created can help one quantify the breadth of an actor’s campaigns.
Comparing such data to reports of intrusions related to those families
can identify how many intrusions get caught, and potentially how many
events remain unknown in the public domain. Finally, it can provide novel

of time (in days) between when a C2 server is created, and
when it is reported or detected in other sources. This identified
924 servers where lead time was generated, by comparing first

There is less predictability in the most common ASNs used across OSTs,
as they are readily available for red team exercises and unauthorized intrusions.

Nearly all of the OSTs detected by Recorded Future have been linked to
APT or high-end financial actors. The ease of access and use of these tools,

mixed with the murkiness of potential attribution makes them appealing for
unauthorized intrusions and red teams alike. This, in addition to the adoption of
these frameworks by ransomware actors, makes their detection a priority.

Host(er)s With the Most (C2s)
Recorded Future C2 data allowed us to identify the most popular hosting
providers for C2 servers. We observed the creation of C2 infrastructure on 576
hosting providers, representing only a small percentage of the total AS operators,
which exceeds 60,000 providers.
The most-used ASNs are undoubtedly linked to the size of the provider, not
necessarily implying that they are bulletproof hosting providers or complicit in
adversary actions. The most used tooling can be considered dual use, increasing
the volume of these servers on more reputable AS ranges.
Amazon.com, Inc., operating out of the United States, hosted the most C2s of
an ASN observed by Recorded Future. They accounted for 471 individual command
and control servers (roughly 3.8 percent). The most commonly observed family on
Amazon.com, Inc. was Cobalt Strike, with 167 servers identified. The next largest

Due to these factors, it is important to implement security controls and

approaches are recommended to detect intrusion activity on the victim host, at
the perimeter, and on the wire.
