An overview of a bulletproof hosting provider named ELITETEAM.

Introduction: What is “Bulletproof Hosting” (BPH)?

1/23

Bulletproof hosting (BPH) is a type of service offered by hosting providers that allows
operators unrestricted and unregulated use of their paid infrastructure. Usually, these
providers ignore abuse complaints, giving threat actors an ideal platform to conduct various
malicious activities.

BPH providers prefer to operate in jurisdictions that have lenient laws against such conduct.
Due to the different laws in different countries, this creates a significant gray area that allows
BPH providers to claim immunity to what their customers (threat actors) host.

In addition to malicious activities, some of the other services enabled / hosted by BPH
providers include online gambling, the sharing of copyrighted materials, misinformation, etc.

A number of online monikers are associated with individuals involved in the provision of BPH
services, and include; Yalishanda, BraZZZerS, MoreneHost, and Vicetemple.

Executive Summary
ELITETEAM, a bulletproof hosting provider registered in the Republic of Seychelles, is
associated with multiple malicious campaigns.
Multiple distinct clusters of threat activity were noted, operating from IP addresses
within a netblock associated with ELITETEAM.
Each threat cluster had seemingly different “goals”, from directly stealing banking
information to deploying ransomware and crypto miners. With a diverse range of
targets, and notable differences in attacker TTPs.
Evidence was identified, based on AS announcements, linking ELITETEAM to another
known Russian bulletproof hosting provider.

ELITETEAM Netblock Summary

ELITETEAM owns four different ASNs as “1337TEAM LIMITED”: AS39770, AS60424,
AS56873, and AS51381, but mainly operates from AS51381, which is associated with
netblock 185.215.113.0/24.

Looking at the WHOIS data related to this netblock, an address in Seychelles is provided:

Figure 1: ELITETEAM WHOIS Data

The address “Global Gateway 8, Rue de la Perle office “1337TEAM LIMITED”, Seychelles”
was previously disclosed in documents commonly referred to as the Panama Papers and
Offshore Leaks, indicating that ELITETEAM may use Seychelles as a front for their
operations, whilst controlling them from another location.

Infrastructure Summary
The identified malicious infrastructure, hosted via ELITETEAM and discussed in this blog
post, is divided into three different clusters, as follows:
Cluster 1: Malvertising and info-stealing
Cluster 2: Phishing
Cluster 3: Skimming

Cluster 1
The first cluster, and currently the most active one, was previously observed (since
December 2020), targeting victims through exploitation of the Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)
vulnerability. However, since around February 2022, we have observed a switch to the use of

3/23

malvertising campaigns, using ‘fake’ software as a lure, leading to the installation of the
Amadey malware on victim machines.

Figure 2: Malvertising Campaign

Following the initial installation of Amadey, depending on the version number of the malware,
(3.08 through to 3.21 was observed in this cluster) one of two payloads are then dropped;
Redline stealer, or Smokeloader. It appears the initial goal of the threat actors is the theft of
victim information / credentials, however further payloads were also observed being dropped,
including Djvu ransomware and crypto miners.

During this investigation, we focused our research on five Amadey C2 servers:

4/23

Figure 3: Amadey C2 Servers

Note: For reasons unknown, this cluster hosts multiple different versions of Amadey,
all of which are currently in use in attacks.

Pivoting on URL strings associated with the Amadey C2 servers (Figure 2), we were able to
identify a list of tasks hosted on 185.215.113.92 (Amadey version 3.21).

Figure 4: Tasks Hosted on 185.215.113.92

The payloads associated with these tasks appeared to be hosted on a Bitbucket account
named ‘USASoftwareDevelopment’.

5/23

Figure 5: USASoftwareDevelopment Bitbucket Account

Analysis of these payloads identify them as Redline stealer executables (botnet: IMHOTEP),
which are likely loaded onto victim systems to facilitate data theft and systems
reconnaissance. Data from victim systems is then exfiltrated to 185.215.113.217.

Note: The number of downloads recorded against each payload provides a further
indication to the scale of this activity.

Figure 6: Data Exfiltration to 185.215.113.217

Similar findings were also observed for 185.215.113.205, which was not initially identified as
an Amadey C2 server.
6/23

Figure 7: Tasks Hosted on 185.215.113.205

In this case, the payloads were hosted on a different Bitbucket account (‘Alex’), but again all
of the samples analyzed were identified as Redline stealer. Of note, data exfiltration for these
payloads was to 65.21.133.231 (assigned to AS24940 - Hetzner Online GmbH).

Figure 8: Data Exfiltration to 65.21.133.231

Examining threat telemetry for 65.21.133.231:47430, it is apparent that this particular
campaign became active on 20 August 2022, and to date has seen at least 500 victims. The
observed victims were dispersed globally, with the highest concentrations in Brazil, India, and
South Africa, based on IP geo-location data.

Finally, a third Bitbucket account (named ‘mrssoprano666’) was identified, again associated
with 185.215.113.92.

7/23

Figure 9: ‘mrssoprano666’ Bitbucket Account

In this case, we pay witness to a potential “career” change. We identified a user called
‘mrssoprano666’ on an underground Russian-language forum, offering ‘physical’ services
associated with fraudulent activity. These services included answering telephone calls,
making calls to victims (posing as a bank or shop), and the rerouting of parcels.

8/23

Figure 10: Forum Post by ‘mrssoprano666’

Based on the timeline of activity on this forum, it appears that the user ‘mrssoprano666’
disappeared in 2020 (having advertised their services since 2018) before subsequently reappearing as a cybercrime affiliate this year.

Cluster 2
The second cluster is mainly used to conduct phishing campaigns, with a particular focus on
the spoofing of investment and cryptocurrency platforms. This cluster is highly active,
particularly considering AS51381 only accounts for 256 IP addresses, ranking 8th place in
Interisle’s Phishing Landscape 2021 behind much larger ASs.

Figure 11: Phishing Landscape 2021 Rankings

Three IPs are used to host phishing sites:
185.215.113.100
Observed most recently in a campaign targeting Polish Credit-Agricole users.
185.215.113.201
Used as a Redline Stealer C2 until April 2022

9/23

Switched to phishing purposes in June 2022
185.215.113.206
As noted previously, there is a financial flavor to this cluster, in one campaign we observed
the targeting of Fidelity customers, in an attempt to steal credentials.

Figure 12: Phishing Page Targeting Fidelity

Interestingly, there was also a second stage to this attack; usually attackers are simply
seeking credentials, but in this case it appears the attackers wanted to double up on the
opportunity. Once a user had entered their credentials, they were directed to download a file
called ‘Fidelity Protect Services’. This is a completely fictitious product offering from Fidelity,
but continues to be a highly convincing part of the scam.

10/23

Figure 13: Fidelity Protect Services

The file (hosted at cv19alert[.]com/fidelityprotect.exe) was not available for download at the
time of our investigation. However, a copy was uploaded to Virustotal on 28 June 2022 by a
user in the United States (MD5: 4532b0d0ca6330bf73e0d6f76f8cf35b).

Analysis of the sample identifies it as a Raccoon Stealer V2 payload, with the timeline
aligning with the malware first being spotted in the wild (and initially referred to as
RecordBreaker based on User Agent strings).

In the first stage, the malware pushes the ‘machineId’ and username to the C2 server, along
with the ‘configId’ (RC4 key).

11/23

Figure 14: Initial POST Request

The RC4 key is used to decrypt the location of the C2 server, in this case 104.193.255.48
(AS14576 - HOSTING SOLUTIONS).

Figure 15: Decrypted C2 Server

Unfortunately the C2 was offline at the time of our investigation, so we were not able to
retrieve the full configuration of the malware.

Cluster 3
The third cluster is connected to credit and debit card skimming activity, with the earliest
observations occurring in November 2021.

A campaign associated with this cluster was previously reported on by the Sucuri research
team, which noted:
Compromise of the victim website, with an attempt to load a malicious JavaScript file.
Website visitors met with an unwarranted prompt for credit card information.
Spoofing of the legitimate domain ‘api.jquery.com’; the attackers used a similar domain
‘apiujquery[.]com’.

12/23

C2 server used to serve the secondary payload, allowing for JavaScript injections into
pages when certain keywords were triggered, e.g., ‘checkout’, ‘my-account’, ‘order’.
C2 server located at 51.178.8.230 (AS16276 - OVH).
At some stage after the publication of this blog, the C2 server was moved to 185.215.113.5.

Figure 16: Current Campaign C2 Details
Based on our threat telemetry for 185.215.113.5, we have observed at least 50 unique
victims connecting to the C2 server over the past three months.

Reviewing the current campaign, it appears very similar to the one reported on nearly a year
ago. The first JavaScript injection payload sends a unique hash to the C2 to register and
identify the victim on the admin side.

However, some updates to the second stage payload have been noted. Firstly, the ‘triggered
words’ list has been updated to include several more keywords.

13/23

Figure 17: Triggered Words List

Secondly, an additional C2 server was identified, hosted on 185.215.113.20. Both the initial
and the ‘new’ C2 server share the same SSH Server Host Key value.

The current IOCs for this campaign are therefore as follows:

Big Picture

Big Picture - Summary of Infrastructure
Zooming out from the clusters already discussed, a significant number of IPs within the
185.215.113.0/24 netblock have been linked to malicious activity in the recent past. With
110~ IPs categorized as malicious within VirusTotal over the past 90 days, and 80~ IPs
associated with entries made to ThreatFox within the past year.

Big Picture - AS Details
ELITETEAM have been highlighted in the past by other researchers, identifying them as
malicious / BPH providers. To quote Spamhaus in their botnet report from 2021
“[ELITETEAM] is a bulletproof hosting company purporting to be located in Seychelles. In
reality, they more than likely operate out of Russia.”
16/23

In late 2020, when the ASs were first allocated to ELITETEAM, they were initially declared as
Russian before being updated to reflect their status as Seychellois, as is the case today.

Figure 20: ASN Description Information for AS51381 and AS60424

Digging deeper into the details surrounding the ASs assigned to ELITETEAM, looking at
information such as netblock announcements and peering, we were able to establish further
ties to Russia.

Figure 21: ELITETEAM Peers

Indeed, all ASs connected to the ELITETEAM infrastructure are owned by Russian entities:
AS3555 | Crex Fex Pex Internet System Solutions LLC | Announcing AS51381 until
January 2021

17/23

AS203804 | AS Infolika | Peer until February 2021
Details of the above activity have been disclosed previously by Valery Reiss-Marchive when
discussing the Egregor ransomware.
AS213254 | OOO RAIT TELECOM | Peer until August 2022
AS49612 | DDOS-GUARD LTD | Current peer as of September 2022
AS3175 | Filanco LLC | Owned by Datahouse.ru, another Russian BPH provider for
which ELITETEAM is an upstream peer
AS213254 (OOO RAIT TELECOM) was seized by US law enforcement (ICE - Homeland
Security Investigations) in early September 2022 and is currently no longer visible on the
routing table.

Figure 22: US Law Enforcement Takedown of AS213254

It is possible that at some stage in the chain the operators were aware of the law
enforcement action, as there was a migration observed in August 2022, where for a period
both AS213254 and AS49612 were observed as peers for AS51381.

18/23

Conclusion

As outlined throughout this blog, ELITETEAM enables malicious activity on a significant
scale, allowing threat actors to operate with impunity against global targets, who in some
cases appear to be individuals with surplus funds with which to invest or experiment with
digital currencies, and in others just your average Joe Public. We have observed varying
campaigns and TTPs, indicating diverse usage of ELITETEAM’s services by threat actors of
varying skill sets. It is not often sound advice to say, ”block all connections to a /24”, but in
respect of the infrastructure assigned to ELITETEAM, overwhelming evidence compels us to
suggest this to be the case.

All the data and information we have researched points to ELITETEAM being Russian /
Russian-speaking, operating behind a shell organization in Seychelles. We have reason to
believe that Datahouse, RU is connected to ELITETEAM and worthy of further investigation.
