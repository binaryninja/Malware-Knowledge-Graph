On April 18, 2022, CERT-UA published alert #4490, which describes a malicious email
campaign targeting Ukraine. The email attempts to deploy a Cobalt Strike beacon on the
victim's system through the use of a MS Office macro. In the alert, CERT-UA provides a list
of indicators of compromise (IoCs), including a list of IP addresses and domains used in the
attack that are known to be Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) servers.
IronNet Threat Research regularly monitors the internet for malicious C2 servers, including
Cobalt Strike. As a result of this monitoring, we have a longitudinal dataset on the C2 servers
hosted on the IP addresses and domains referenced in the alert starting in May 2021. This
report provides an analysis of this data in an attempt to inform the community on the
observed patterns of these IoCs and other indicators that may be related to those referenced
in the alert.

Cobalt Strike: Malleable Profiles
One of the ways Cobalt Strike operators obfuscate communications between a beacon
planted on a victim system and the C2 server is through the use of a malleable profile. A
malleable profile allows the operator to configure the beacon communication to masquerade
as benign network traffic. Some of the settings that can be modified are:
the sleep time between callbacks to the C2 server,
jitter in the callback sleep time,
the user agent used in the communication, and
the URI used in the HTTP request to the C2 server.

While these malleable profiles are useful in obfuscating communications, they can also be
used as an approximate fingerprint when analyzing a Cobalt Strike C2 server. While most
actors use open source malleable profiles or a malleable profile generator, which makes
attribution or clustering challenging, a server's profile can be combined with other attributes
to identify patterns. A full discussion of malleable profiles is beyond the scope of this report,
but there are numerous descriptions available elsewhere (link, link).
Two of the profiles that were seen in the campaign targeting Ukraine were a JQuery profile
and a minimal defender bypass profile. JQuery is a popular choice of emulation amongst
threat actors; however, the minimal defender bypass profile is something that we’ve only
noticed in the past few months and only in this campaign.

Figure 1 - Malleable profile GET URI's observed in the IoCs since May 2021
Of the options available in malleable profiles, the request uniform resource indicator (URI) is
the most varied and the most useful for attempting to fingerprint, or at least categorize, C2
servers using the malleable profile. In total, eight different URIs were observed in use by the
C2 servers mentioned in the CERT-UA alert, indicating that there were at least eight different
malleable profiles used. Of particular interest are the two profiles observed in 2022, which
overlap with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the associated cyber attacks. The URIs
associated with these profiles are shown in Figure 1.

numerous C2 servers described in the Ukrainian CERT alert
The profile with the /jquery-3.3.1.min.js URI is the more common of the two profiles,
both in this particular set of IoCs and in IronNet's full data set of Cobalt Strike C2 servers
(see Figure 2). This particular malleable profile can be found on the internet and is listed as a
reference for designing Cobalt Strike malleable profiles. As such, use of this profile makes
attribution difficult since it is used everywhere.

Figure 3 - A malleable profile found online that is intended to be hidden behind an Nginx
redirector that matches observed C2 servers described in the Ukrainian CERT alert
The second profile, which is referred to as the minimal defender bypass profile and has the
/apiv8/getStatus URI, can also be found on the internet, but its observed use is far more
rare than the previous one (see Figure 3). These servers were the first observations we have
4/8

had of this profile. At first, we thought this was due to the relative novelty of the profile.
However, further inspection indicates the profile is intended to be used behind an Nginx
redirector to hide the C2 server from fingerprinting.
Both of these profiles used in the most recent attacks are pre-made and provide a low effort
configuration cost. We often see malleable profiles that are customized versions of profiles
found on the internet. For example, the domain klycnmik[.]com , which uses the same
jQuery URI, has been observed in use by Cobalt Strike servers associated with Emotet.

Cobalt Strike: Watermarks

Figure 4 - Cobalt Strike watermarks observed in the IoCs since May 2021
Another means of categorizing and analyzing Cobalt Strike C2 servers is through the use of
the server's watermark. Each payload deployed by a server contains a watermark, which is a
unique number associated with the Cobalt Strike license. But since stolen or cracked copies
of Cobalt Strike are frequently used by threat actors, using a watermark as a fingerprint isn't
foolproof. For example, a watermark value of 0 indicates a cracked version. Unsurprisingly,
this is the most commonly found watermark in our data. Despite this, watermarks can still be
used for analysis. The watermarks we observed being used by the IoCs described by CERTUA are shown in Figure 4. The watermark of particular interest here is 1580103824 . It is
shared by all the C2 servers using the /apiv8/getStatus URI, which was specifically
noted in the CERT-UA alert. While C2 servers with different profiles and configurations could
potentially have this same watermark, we rarely observe this watermark, but have seen an

5/8

increase in recent weeks. Note that this watermark is very similar (one digit differs) from one
associated with a hacked version of Cobalt Strike that is frequently found on dark web
forums.
Of the five domains that share the rare URI and watermark, only four are mentioned in the
CERT-UA alert. These are: axikok[.]com , blopik[.]com , dezword[.]com , and
verofes[.]com . The fifth observed domain, furfen[.]com , is not mentioned in the
CERT-UA alert, but has, in addition to our own scans, been observed by other sources to be
a Cobalt Strike C2 server. While a URI and watermark is insufficient to confirm that this
server is related to the others, further analysis detailed below lends more credence to the
argument that they are related.

NGINX
We found the use of the minimal defender bypass profile to be of particular interest, not
because it was used, but because they took the time to lock down the C2 communications,
but left the staging wide open. The profile is intended to be used with a redirector to prevent
the C2 server from being fingerprinted with conventional methods. This is a fairly common
technique that is not unique to Cobalt Strike and has been utilized by threat actors for quite
some time. Redirectors are positioned between the C2 server and the beacon to hide the
true location of the C2 server. They are often configured to only redirect specific traffic from a
beacon to the C2 server and to direct the remaining traffic to a legitimate server, making the
detection of these servers challenging.

Cobalt Strike Infrastructure

6/8

Figure 5 - Observation dates of the IoCs mentioned in the Ukrainian CERT alert since May
2021 (organized by unique domain or IP address)
Apart from server configurations, there are a number of interesting relationships between the
infrastructure of the C2 servers mentioned in the alert. Over the course of the last 15 months,
there were three distinct clusters of activity for the IoCs described in the Ukrainian CERT
alert. The distribution of observations for the cluster observed in 2022 is shown in Figure 5.
In this cluster, 35 different domains were observed, but, as discussed above, they share
many similarities such as profiles and watermarks.
The vast majority of the hosts listen on either port 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), or both, as
would be expected. One server, axikok[.]com primarily listened on 8443 (HTTPS), but did
have port 8080 (HTTP) opened intermittently.
According to our data, the C2 servers in the alert are all hosted in one of four hosting
providers: HostKey, HostKey B.V., Endurance International, and UAB Nacionalinis
Telekomunikaciju, with 33 of the 40 hosted by HostKey as far back as June 2021. As for the
domains themselves, all of the domains used in the most recent campaign were registered to
one of three registrars: Eranet, WEBCC, and NiceNIC, with 26 of the 30 domains registered
at Eranet since January 10, 2022.

Next Steps
It’s clear that the ease of use and flexibility that Cobalt Strike provides is one of the main
reasons that it remains so prevalent amongst threat actors. Reflecting on the analysis of our
dataset matched with the indicators provided in the UA CERT alert, there are a few open
questions remaining. First, we see less sophisticated threat actors still deploy Cobalt Strike
servers with little to no OPSEC, allowing even the most basic detections of C2 frameworks.
Thus, will threat actors continue to forgo OPSEC concerns as long as they continue to
dominate victims with high success rates?
Second, we wonder whether the majority of threat actors will utilize open source malleable
profiles or a malleable profile generator like C2 Concealer that takes static attributes from a
list and combines them to a single profile? Furthermore, do threat actors take into
consideration the environment they are targeting when selecting a malleable profile, or are
they simply choosing a popular service they know will thwart most defenders? Answers to
these questions will be beneficial to detecting Cobalt Strike servers in the future.
