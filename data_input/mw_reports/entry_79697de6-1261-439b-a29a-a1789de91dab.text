BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MICROSOFT’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
TEMPORARILY SEALING DOCUMENTS
Microsoft submits the following memorandum in support of its Motion for a Protective
Order Sealing Documents.

BACKGROUND
Microsoft has filed an Ex Parte Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Preliminary
Injunction Motion”) to prevent the activities of John Doe Defendants 1 and 2 (collectively
“Defendants”) who are engaged in harmful and malicious Internet activities directed at
Microsoft, its customers, and the general public. In the Preliminary Injunction Motion,
Microsoft seeks ex parte relief to disable the recently registered domains set forth in
Appendix A to the Complaint. That will cease the irreparable harm resulting from
Defendants’ conduct. Microsoft seeks relief under seal, with respect to the portion of the
Order disabling the domains in Appendix A to the Complaint, because advance public
disclosure or notice of that requested relief would allow Defendants to evade such relief and
1

further prosecution of this action, thereby perpetuating the irreparable harm at issue. The
reasons for Microsoft’s request are set forth in detail in the Preliminary Injunction Motion
filed concurrently herewith. Therefore, Microsoft requests that the Ex Parte Motion to
Supplement Preliminary Injunction Order and associated pleadings be sealed pending
execution of the ex parte relief sought in Microsoft’s Preliminary Injunction Order, in
particular disabling of the domains set forth in Appendix A to the Complaint. Microsoft’s
requested sealing order is narrowly tailored to impose the least restriction on the public’s
right of access to information as possible. Microsoft requests that all sealed documents be
immediately unsealed upon execution of the portion of the Order disabling the domains set
forth in Appendix A to the Complaint. As soon as that relief is executed, all papers will be
made available on the public docket.
ARGUMENT
The right of access to court records is not absolute. Nixon v. Warner Commc 'ns, Inc., 435
U.S. 589, 597-98 (1978). Although both common law and the First Amendment afford the public
a qualified right of access to judicial proceedings. In re Fort Totten Metrorail Cases, 960 F.
Supp. 2d 2, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the D.C. Circuit has expressed doubts about whether the First
Amendment right of access applies outside of the criminal context. SEC v. Am. Int’l Grp., 712
F.3d 1,5 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Ctr. for Nat’I Sec. Studies v. DOJ, 331 F.3d 918, 935 (D.C. Cir.
2003); In re Reporters Comm, for Freedom of the Press, 773 F.2d 1325, 1337 (D.C. Cir. 1985)
(Scalia, J.) (doubting that the benefits of open criminal trials inure to civil suits between private
parties).
Competing interests may outweigh the public’s common law right of access to judicial
records. United States v. Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293, 317-22 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Indeed, “[a] district

2

court has authority to seal and unseal documents as part of its ‘supervisory power over its own
records and files.

995

United Stales v. Ring, 47 F. Supp. 3d 38, 40 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting Nixon v.

Warner Commons, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978)); In re Nat’l Broad. Co., 653 F.2d 609, 613
(D.C. Cir. 1981) (“Because of the difficulties inherent in formulating a broad yet clear rule to
govern the variety of situations in which the right of access must be reconciled with legitimate
countervailing public or private interests, the decision as to access is one which rests in the sound
discretion of the trial court.”).
Under D.C. Circuit law, the district court should weigh the following when presented with
a motion to seal or unseal: “(1) the need for public access to the documents at issue; (2) the extent
of previous public access to the documents; (3) the fact that someone has objected to disclosure,
and the identity of that person; (4) the strength of any property and privacy interests asserted; (5)
the possibility of prejudice to those opposing disclosure; and (6) the purposes for which the
documents were introduced during the judicial proceedings.” Hubbard, 650 F.2d at 317-22;
Metlife, Inc. v. Fin. Stability Oversight Council, 865 F.3d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Garland,
C.J.) (“[T]he Flubbard test has consistently served as our lodestar because it ensures that we fully
account for the various public and private interests at stake.”).
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also recognize the important public and judicial
interest in protecting confidential business information. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1)(G)
(empowering courts to order “that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or
commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way”). Likewise,
Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit authority recognize the necessity of non-public ex parte
proeeedings. See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Teamsters, 415 U.S. 423, 439, 94 S. Ct. 1113
(1974) (“Ex parte temporary restraining orders are no doubt necessary in certain

3

circumstances...”); Carroll v. President and Com’rs of Princess Anne, 393 U.S. 175, 180 (1968)
(“There is a place in our jurisprudence for ex parte issuance, without notice, of temporary
restraining orders.”); Omar v. Harvey, 2006 WL 286861, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 2006) (holding
that an ex parte restraining order is appropriate where plaintiff demonstrates notice would render
fruitless further prosecution of the action); Council on American-Islamic Relations v. Gaubatz,
667 F. Supp. 2d 67, 75 (D.D.C. Nov. 3, 2009) (noting that ex parte restraining orders may be
appropriate in circumstances where notice is impossible).
In this case, Microsoft’s rights and interests in protecting its ability to obtain ex parte
temporary relief, and the necessity of sealing its pleadings in order to effectively disable the
domains in Appendix A to the Complaint, is paramount over any competing public interest to
immediate access to the information Microsoft requests be sealed. If Microsoft’s papers are not
sealed, the relief sought would very likely be rendered fruitless, and there is a substantial risk
Defendants would destroy evidence. Defendants are highly-sophisticated cybercriminals. They
access Microsoft’s services without authorization; hack into high-value computer networks;
install malware on the networks to gain and maintain long-term, surreptitious access to that
network; and locate and exfiltrate sensitive information off of the networks. See Preliminary
Injunction Motion, filed contemporaneously herewith. If Defendants knew Microsoft sought the
relief set forth in the Preliminary Injunction Motion, they could quickly adapt the command and
control infrastructure used to secretly establish themselves on a victim’s network. Id. at 14.
In fact. Defendants have shown that this is their intention. Defendants continue to misuse
Microsoft’s trademarks and brand names to make their domains seem legitimate. Declaration of
David Anselmi In Support Of Microsoft’s Motion to Supplement Preliminary Injunction Order
(“Anselmi Deck”) ^ 4, set forth at Appendix B to this Brief Given Microsoft’s actions against

4

Defendants in this case, even disclosing that Microsoft has filed a Preliminary Injunction Motion
gives Defendants the opportunity to change their command and control infrastructure, set forth at
Appendix A to the Complaint.
Additionally, evidence shows that when the Phosphorus defendants become aware of
efforts to mitigate or investigate their activities, they take steps to conceal their activities and to
conceal the injury caused to their victims, making it more difficult for their victims to adequately
assess the damage or take steps to mitigate that injury going forward. Id. ^ 32. For example, once
Defendants become aware that domains in Phosphorus’ active infrastructure become known to
the security community, they abandon that infrastructure and move to new infrastructure that is
used to continue their efforts to intrude upon the computers of existing victims and new victims.
Id. In the last five years, Microsoft has brought similar cases against John Doe defendants who
have been conducting illegal activities through identifiable but movable infrastructures on the
Internet very similar to that used by Phosphorus. Declaration of Gabriel M. Ramsey In Support
Of Motion For Protective Order (“Ramsey Deck”) f 5, set forth at Appendix C to this Brief In
four of those cases, the defendants immediately attempted to either destroy evidence or move
their command and control infrastructure upon detecting the legal action being taken against
them. Id. This underscores the risk that the Defendants in this case will take similar steps to
destroy evidence and move their command and control infrastructure in Appendix A if they are
given notice of the Preliminary Injunction Motion. Id. ^ 6.
The harm that would be caused by the public filing of Microsoft’s Preliminary Injunction
Motion would far outweigh the public’s right to access that information. There is no need for the
public to have immediate access to the Preliminary Injunction Motion and supporting documents
while Microsoft is seeking ex parte relief with respect to the domains in Appendix A to the

5

Complaint, which will only be effective if these materials remain under seal. Applying the
balancing test set forth in governing law demonstrates that Microsoft’s interest in obtaining
effective relief outweigh any immediate public right to disclosure.
Microsoft only seeks to seal such information for a limited period of time, until after
effective ex parte temporary relief has been obtained, disabling the domains in Appendix A to
the Complaint. After such point, sealing will no longer be necessary, and Microsoft will
Immediately commence efforts to provide Defendants notice of future hearings and service of
related pleadings—at which point, all documents will be unsealed and the public will be given
full access to these proceedings. Microsoft, upon execution of the ex parte relief disabling the
domains in Appendix A to the Complaint, will file with the Clerk of the Court a Notice that the
temporary restraining order has been executed. The Clerk of the Court may then file all
documents related to this request on the public docket.
Should, however, the Court decide not to grant the ex parte relief Microsoft requests,
Microsoft asks that such materials remain sealed for an indefinite period, as public disclosure or
notice absent the ex parte relief requested would facilitate Defendants’ harmful and malicious
Internet activities.
Given the limited period of sealing as an alternative that balances the public interest in
access with Microsoft’s important interests in maintaining these materials under seal for a brief
period of time, granting the instant request to seal is warranted and consistent with the legal
framework for addressing this issue.

DECLARATION OF DAVID ANSELMI IN SUPPORT OF
MICROSOFT’S APPLICATION FOR AN EMERGENCY EX PARTE TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION
I, David Anselmi, declare as follows:
1.

I am a Senior Investigator in the Digital Crimes Unit of Microsoft Corporation’s

Legal and Corporate Affairs Group. I make this declaration in support of Microsoft’s application
for an Emergency Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order And Order To Show Cause Re
Preliminary Injunction. I make this declaration of my own personal knowledge and, if called as
a witness, I could and would testify competently to the truth of the matters set forth herein.
2.

In my current role at Microsoft, I assess technical security threats to Microsoft

and the impact of such threats on Microsoft’s business and customers. Prior to my current role, I
worked as Senior Technologist, dealing with security of Microsoft’s online services. Among my
responsibilities were protecting Microsoft’s customer-facing online service assets from networkbased attacks. Prior to that, while also employed by Microsoft, I worked as a Senior
Technologist, dealing with protecting Microsoft’s corporate resources from network-based

1

attacks. Before joining Microsoft, I worked for Excell Data Corporation as a Program Manager
performing security firewall deployment, configuration, and administration. I am a graduate of
the United States Military Academy, West Point, and served for 27 years as a United States
Army Communications Electronics Officer (11 years active, 16 years reserve), attaining the rank
of Lieutenant Colonel. I have been employed by Microsoft since February 1997.
I.

OVERVIEW OF INVESTIGATION INTO PHOSPHORUS AND CONCLUSIONS
3.

My declaration concerns an organization that is engaged in systematic criminal

activity on the Internet. Because the identities of the individuals behind the activity addressed in
this declaration are unknown, I therefore refer to them collectively by the codename that
Microsoft has assigned to this group: “Phosphorus.” Others in the security community who
have researched this group of actors refer to the group by other names, including “APT 35,”
“Charming Kitten,” and “Ajax Security Team.” The defendants have been linked to an Iranian
hacking group or groups. I have investigated the infrastructure described in this declaration and
have determined that the defendants have registered Internet domains using fictitious names and
fictitious physical addresses that are purportedly located in multiple cities and countries.
Defendants have registered domains using functioning email addresses by whieh they
communicated with domain registrars in order to complete the registration process.
4.

Microsoft investigators have been monitoring and gathering information on the

Phosphorus defendants. In the course of such investigation, I have been working with and
directing a team that (1) engaged in the analysis and creation of “signatures” (which can be
thought of as digital fingerprints) for the infrastructure used by the Phosphorus defendants, (2)
discovered login activity into Microsoft services from Phosphorus-controlled infrastructure on
the Internet, (3) matched reported Phosphorus phishing email campaigns to registered domains,
(4) monitored domain registrations associated with the Phosphorus-controlled email addresses
and other pertinent WHOIS record information, (5) monitored infrastructure frequently utilized
by the Phosphorus defendants in order to identify new domains being registered by the
Phosphorus defendants, (6) have confirmed resolution settings to particular Internet service
2

providers (ISPs) which have frequently been used by the Phosphorus defendants in the past, and
(7) reviewed peer findings and public reporting on the Phosphorus defendants.
5.

As alluded in paragraph 4(1), the investigative team has developed methods to

help us identify new domains registered by the Phosphorus actors. Particular features of the
Phosphorus infrastructure have been identified and patterns of content, non-content, and
technical features have been determined to be exclusively and specifically associated with the
Phosphorus defendants. These features, when identified in the aggregate, provide a high level of
confidence that a given domain is a Phosphorus domain. Each such domain is manually
reviewed in detail by one or more subject matter experts as necessary to ascertain whether it is,
in fact, a Phosphorus domain. Based on this analysis, we have identified characteristics of the
registration and maintenance of certain domains which, when coupled with the nature of the
activities observed being carried out through the domains, are a reliable method to correlate such
domains to actions undertaken by the defendants.
6.

Based on our investigation and analysis, Microsoft has determined that the

Phosphorus defendants specialize in targeting and stealing credentials of prominent users of the
Internet. The Phosphorus defendants target Microsoft and non-Microsoft customers in both the
private and public sectors, including businesses in a variety of different industries. Based on our
research, the Phosphorus defendants have targeted Microsoft customers, political dissidents,
activist leaders, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), journalists, and employees from multiple
government agencies, including individuals protesting oppressive regimes in the Middle East.
For example, attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of a research report by security
research firm FireEye regarding the Phosphorus group (which that firm has called “Ajax Security
Team”).
7.

The Phosphorus defendants’ objectives appear to be obtaining account credentials

to later retrieve sensitive communications within the accounts. We believe that the Phosphorus
defendants have been active since 2013 and continue to pose a threat today and into the future.
II.

PHOSPHORUS’ METHOD OF COMPROMISING AND STEALING
3

INFORMATION FROM VICTIMS
8.

The Phosphorus defendants typically attempt to compromise the personal (not

work) accounts of the targeted individuals through a technique known as “spear phishing.”
Spear phishing attacks are conducted in the following fashion: After researching a victim
organization, the spear phisher will identify individuals associated with that organization through
gathering publicly available information and by social engineering. The spear phisher will then
initiate communications with the victim by using names, companies, and/or contents that are
familiar to the victim. The ensuing communications exchanges are used to social engineer
information, identify additional targets, entice a target into opening up a malicious attachment,
and more. Microsoft has observed fake social networking profiles being created by Phosphorus
defendants which would obviously present significant leverage in carrying out such an attack.
Attached as Exhibit 2 are true and correct copies of such fake social networking profiles, created
by the Phosphorus defendants on the Linkedin social media service.
9.

Another technique utilized by the Phosphorus defendants is to send a targeted

individual an email speeifically crafted to appear as if there is an issue with the targeted
individual’s account. Phishing emails often use generic domain names that appear to be tied to
account activity and that require input of credentials for authentication. For example, domains
such as service-accountrecoverv.com. The Phosphorus defendants send the targeted individual
an email specifically crafted to appear as if there is an issue with the targeted individual’s
account. Through research and investigation, Microsoft has determined that the Phosphorus
defendants have used the domains listed in Exhibit 3 (which is also reflected as Appendix A to
the Complaint) in its command and control infrastructure. As can be seen in Exhibit 3, the
Phosphorus defendants sometimes also disguise their command and control domains by
incorporating the names and trademarks of some well-known companies and organizations,
including Microsoft’s “Microsoft” and Windows “Live” brands, as well as the “Linkedin” brand.
For example, the Phosphorus defendants use the domains com-microsoftonline.club. verificationlive.com. and verifv-linkedin.net.

4

10.

The Phosphorus defendants’ use of Microsoft trademarks is meant to confuse

victims into clicking on links controlled by the Phosphorus defendants. When the user clicks on
the links, they are taken to deceptive web pages that induce the victim to type in their Microsoft
credentials, at which point the Phosphorus defendants obtain access to those credentials. This
will result in the threat actors being able to log into the victim’s account and access their email.
The Phosphorus defendants can also download a copy of the victim’s address book to be used for
future targeting of additional intended victims. Not having safe emails impacts Microsoft’s
brands and services. Customers expect Microsoft to provide safe and trustworthy products and
services. There is a great risk that Microsoft’s customers, both individuals and the enterprises
for which they work, may incorrectly attribute these problems to Microsoft’s products and
services, thereby diluting and tarnishing the value of these trademarks and brands.
11.

The Phosphorus defendants send these emails from a variety of online email

services. As discussed above, there are multiple Phosphorus created domains mimicking
Microsoft brands, and those domains are clearly designed to be included in spear phishing emails
as links to websites that the Phosphorus defendants have set up in advance and which they
control. When a victim clicks on the link in the email, his or her computer is connected with the
Phosphorus-controlled website. The victim is then presented a copy of a webpage that appears to
be a login page for a webmail provider of which the victim is a subscriber. In fact, this is a fake
login page that is designed to induce the user to type in their webmail credentials. If the victim
enters the correct credentials, at that point the Phosphorus actors obtain the user’s credentials and
can thereafter access the user’s webmail account to steal email content and other information.
12.

Figures 1 and 2 below show copies of such webpages created by the Phosphorus

defendants, designed to look like legitimate Microsoft Outlook login pages;

Phosphorus targets other brands beyond Microsoft and purport to be password

reset or account login pages of other companies. For example, the Phosphorus defendants use
fake emails instructing users to click links and type in credentials, fake “Verify” buttons
prompting users to type their credentials into fraudulent login pages and fake “Sign in” pages
instructing users to enter their user name and password. All of these methods are designed to
induce users to type in credentials. As seen above with respect to the fake Microsoft login pages
inviting users to type in their Microsoft Outlook “User name” and “Password,” this scheme is
typical of the Phosphorus defendants’ activities. Figures 3 through 6 are further examples of
this tactic:

14.

Upon successful compromise of a victim account, the Phosphorus defendants will

not only be able to log into the account and review the victim’s emails, but may also delete the
spear phishing email that they previously sent to the user in an attempt to obfuscate their
activities.
15.

The Phosphorus defendants have targeted victims who are using Microsoft email

services, and Microsoft investigators have confirmed that Phosphorus defendants have intruded
into those accounts to steal information of Microsoft’s users. Figures 1 and 2 above
demonstrate the Phosphorus defendants targeting users of Microsoft’s Outlook email services.
16.

Microsoft investigators were also able to locate the control panel used by the

Phosphorus defendants to create links sent to intended victims as well as to track successfully
compromised victims who clicked on those links, typed in their credentials and had those
credentials stolen by the defendants. Microsoft analysts identified the Phosphorus domain
confirm-session-identification.info which led to discovery of the control panel URL. This
control panel was accessed by a URL that was open and required no authentication. The control
panel that the Phosphorus defendants used to monitor and control their access to victim accounts
9

was present on the domain: confirm-session-identification.info. The domain confirm-sessionidentification.info was registered on 10/17/2018 as seen in the WHOIS record from a commonly
used domain research tool called Domaintools.com. This WHOIS record is reflected in Figure

The Phosphorus defendants also intrude upon and cause injury to Microsoft and

Microsoft’s customers by damaging the customers’ computers and the software installed on their
computers. In particular, the Phosphorus defendants have sent deceptive email messages to
victims, such as those discussed above, which include links to websites from which the
defendants install malicious software onto the victims’ computers. The defendants refer to the
malicious software as “Stealer.” Stealer, once installed, can record what the victim types on their
keyboard, take screenshots of what is on the victim’s computer screen, steal login credentials for
instant messaging account (including information about victims’ Microsoft-owned “Skype”
messaging accounts), email accounts, and other credentials. The Stealer software is installed
from, and stolen information may be transferred to, defendants using command and control
domains such as those reflected in Exhibit 3.
21.

The installation of this malicious software damages the victim’s computer and the

Windows operating system on the victim’s computer. During the infection of a victim’s
computer, the malicious Stealer software makes changes at the deepest and most sensitive levels
of the computer’s Windows operating system. The consequences of these changes are that the
user’s version of Windows is essentially adulterated, and unknown to the user, has been
converted into a tool to steal credentials and sensitive information from the user. This inherently
involves abuse of Microsoft’s trademarks and brands, and deceives users by presenting an
unauthorized, modified version of Windows to those users. For example, the defendants create
registry key paths bearing the Microsoft “Windows” trademark, within the Microsoft operating
system, including, among others:
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe" "C:\ Documents and
Settings\{USER}\ApplicationData\lntelRapidStart\AppTransferWiz.dll",#110

22.

Further, as seen in Figure 11 below, the Phosphorus defendants include metadata

within the Stealer malicious software that expressly misrepresents that the software is created by
“Microsoft” and that the software is a “Process for Windows.”

PHOSPHORUS HAS ATTACKED MANY MICROSOFT CUSTOMERS IN THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND AROUND THE WORLD
23.

Through its investigation, Microsoft has determined that the Phosphorus

defendants have targeted Microsoft customers in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States. In only the last few months alone, four new individual victims of the Phosphorus

14

defendants’ email intrusion activities have been identified in the District of Columbia.
IV.

HARM TO MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT CUSTOMERS
24.

Phosphorus irreparably harms Microsoft by damaging its reputation, brands, and

customer goodwill. Microsoft is the provider of the Windows operating system and Outlook,
Hotmail, OneDrive and Office 365 email and cloud services, as well as a variety of other
software and services. Microsoft is the owner of the “Microsoft,” ’’Windows,” “Outlook,”
“Windows Live,” “Hotmail,” “OneDrive” and “Office 365” trademarks. Trademark registrations
for marks infringed by the Phosphorus defendants are attached to Microsoft’s complaint as
Appendix B. Microsoft has invested substantial resources in developing high-quality products
and services. Microsoft has also invested, through its subsidiaries, in high value brands and
services such as the “Linkedin” brand and service. Due to the high quality and effectiveness of
Microsoft’s products and services and the expenditure of significant resources by Microsoft to
market those products and services, Microsoft has generated substantial goodwill with its
customers, has established a strong brand, and has developed the Microsoft name and the names
of its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are well-recognized
within its channels of trade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing the quality of its
products and service and its brand, including the trademarks listed above.
25.

Microsoft’s customers whose email accounts are compromised through the

defendants’ credential theft are damaged by these activities. Similarly, Microsoft’s customers
whose computers are infected with the malicious Stealer software are damaged by changes to
Windows, which alter the normal and approved settings and functions of the user’s operating
system, destabilize it, and enable unauthorized monitoring of the user and theft of user data.
26.

In effect, once infected, altered and controlled by the Stealer software, the

Windows operating system ceases to operate normally and is now a tool of deception and theft
aimed at the owner of the infected computer. Yet they still bear the Microsoft Windows
trademark. This is obviously meant to mislead Microsoft’s customers, and it causes extreme
damage to Microsoft’s brands and trademarks.
15

27.

Customers are usually unaware of the fact that their email accounts are

compromised, that their computers are infected, that they are being monitored by the defendants
or that sensitive information is being stolen from them. Even if aware of an account intrusion or
an infection of their computer, users often lack the technical resources or skills to resolve the
problem, allowing their accounts and computers to be misused indefinitely, as manual steps to
change account credentials or remove the malicious software may be difficult for ordinary users.
They may be futile to a degree too where the Phosphorus defendants have software installed to
observe the victim’s activities and attempts to remediate the intrusion. Even with professional
assistance, cleaning an infected end-user computer can be exceedingly difficult, time-consuming,
and frustrating. This demonstrates the extreme problems that the activities of the Phosphorus
defendants cause for Microsoft’s customers and the irreparable injury to both Microsoft and its
customers. Microsoft and other members of the public must invest considerable time and
resources investigating and remediating the defendants’ intrusion into accounts and computers.
28.

The activities of the Phosphorus defendants injure Microsoft and its reputation,

brand, and goodwill. Users subject to the negative effects of the Phosphorus defendants’ spear
phishing emails sometimes incorrectly believe that Microsoft is the source of the problem, and
thus there is a significant risk that Microsoft customers will be confused in this way in the future.
There is a great risk that Microsoft customers may incorrectly attribute these problems to
Microsoft and associate these problems with Microsoft’s products and services, thereby diluting
and tarnishing the value of these trademarks and brands.
V.

DISRUPTING PHOSPHORUS’ ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
29.

The Phosphorus defendants’ illegal activities will not be easy to disrupt.

Evidence indicates that the Phosphorus defendants are highly sophisticated, well-resourced,
organized, and patient. The Phosphorus defendants specialize in targeting individuals in
organizations holding sensitive data, by gathering extensive information about their employees
through publicly available information and social media, using that information to fashion
phishing attacks intended to trick those employees into compromising their credentials, and
16

disguising its activities using the names and trademarks of Microsoft and other legitimate
companies.
30.

The most vulnerable point in the Phosphorus defendants’ operations are a number

of Internet domains through which the Phosphorus defendants obtain victim credentials, log into
compromised accounts, and review sensitive information from victim accounts. A core subset of
these is listed in Appendix A to the Complaint. These domains sometimes incorporate
trademarks that are owned by Microsoft or by other companies that have been informed of and
have no objection to Microsoft’s proposal to take possession of these domains. Granting
Microsoft possession of these domains will enable Microsoft to channel all communications to
those domains to secure servers, and thereby cut off the means by which the Phosphorus
defendants collect victim credentials. In other words, any time a user clicks on a link in a spear
phishing email and provides their username and password, that information will be prevented
from going to the defendants at the Phosphorus domains, because those domains will be hosted
on a Microsoft-controlled, secure server, beyond the control of defendants. While it is not
possible to rule out the possibility that the Phosphorus defendants could use fall back
mechanisms to evade the requested relief, redirecting this core subset of Phosphorus domains
will directly disrupt current Phosphorus infrastructure, mitigating risk and injury to Microsoft
and its customers. The requested relief will also serve the public interest, in protecting
customers of other web services companies who have consented to the relief sought in this
action.
31.

I believe that the most effective way to suspend the injury caused to Microsoft, its

consumers, and the public, is to take the steps described in the [Proposed] Ex Parte Temporary
Restraining Order and Order to show Cause Re Preliminary Injunction (“Proposed TRO”). This
relief will significantly hinder the Phosphorus defendants’ ability to compromise additional
accounts and identify new potential victims to target. In the absence of such action, the
Phosphorus defendants will be able to continue using this infrastructure to target new accounts,
exposing potential new victims to the Phosphorus defendants’ malieious activities.
17

32.

The Phosphorus defendants’ teehniques are designed to resist technieal mitigation

efforts, eliminating easy technical means to curb the injury being caused. For example, once
domains in the Phosphorus defendants’ active infrastructure become known to the security
community, the defendants abandon that infrastructure and move to new infrastructure that is
used to continue the Phosphorus defendants’ efforts to compromise accounts of new victims.
For this reason, providing notice to the Phosphorus defendants in advance of redirection of the
domains at issue would render attempts to disable the infrastructure futile. Further, when the
Phosphorus defendants become aware of efforts to mitigate or investigate their activities, they
take steps to conceal their activities and to conceal the injury that has been caused to victims,
making it more difficult for victims to adequately assess the damage or take steps to mitigate that
injury going forward. For this reason as well, providing notice to the Phosphorus defendants in
advance of redirection of the domains at issue would render attempts to mitigate the harm futile,
or at least much more difficult for Microsoft. Piecemeal requests to disable these domains,
informal dispute resolution or notice to the defendants prior to redirecting the domains would be
insufficient to curb the injury. Based on my experience observing the operation of numerous
intrusions such as those carried out by the Phosphorus defendants, and prior investigations and
legal actions involving such intrusions and actors, 1 believe that the Phosphorus defendants
would take swift preemptive action to conceal the extent of the victimization of Microsoft and its
customers and to defend their infrastructure, if they were to learn of Microsoft’s impending
action and request for relief
33.

I am informed and believe there have been prior instances where security

researchers or the government attempted to curb injury caused by actors carrying out intrusions
such as those in this case, but allowed those actors to receive notice. In these cases, the actors
quickly concealed the scope and nature of their intrusion, and moved the infrastructure to new,
unidentified locations on the Internet and took other countermeasures causing the actors to
continue their operations and destroying or concealing evidence of their operations. Indeed,
CERTFA published a report on this actor group on December 13, 2018 (Exhibit 4). Subsequent
18

to that report, the control panel cited in Figures 8 through 10 was updated to require
authentication. For all of these reasons, I believe that the only way to mitigate injury and disrupt
the most recent, active Phosphorus infrastructure, is to redirect the domains at issue prior to
providing notice to the defendants,
34.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America

that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Executed this

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

We believe we're seeing an evolution and development in Iranian-based cyber activity, n
years past, Iranian actors primarily committed politically-motivated website defacement
and DDoS attacks.^ More recently, however, suspected Iranian actors have destroyed data
on thousands of computers with the Shamoon virus,^ and they have penetrated the Navy
Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), which is used by the U.S. Navy worldwide. 3

In this report, we document the activities of the
Ajax Security Team, a hacking group believed to be
operating from Iran. Members of this group have
accounts on popular Iranian hacker forums such as
ashiyanej.jorg and shabgardf.jorg, and they have
engaged in website defacements under the group
name “AjaxTM" since 2010. By 2014, the Ajax
Security Team had transitioned from performing
defacements (their last defacement was in
December 2013) to malware-based espionage,
using a methodology consistent with other
advanced persistent threat actors in this region.
it is unclear if the Ajax Security Team operates in
isolation or if they are a part of a larger
coordinated effort. The Ajax Security Team itself
uses malware tools that do not appear to be
publicly available. We have seen this group
leverage varied social engineering tactics as a
means to lure their targets into infecting
themselves with malware. Although we have not
observed the use of exploits as a means to infect
victims, members of the Ajax Security Team have
previously used publicly available exploit code in
web site defacement operations.
In sum, FireEye has recently observed the Ajax
Security Team conducting multiple cyber
espionage operations against companies in the
defense industrial base (DIB) within the Unites
States, as well as targeting local Iranian users of
anti-censorship technologies that bypass Iran's
Internet filtering system.

Background
The transition from patriotic hacking to cyber
espionage is not an uncommon phenomenon. It
typically follows an Increasing politicization within
the hacking community, particularly around
geopolitical events. This is followed by increasing
links between the hacking community and the
state, particularly military and/or intelligence
organizations.
in the late 1990's and early 2000’s, a similar
transition occurred within the Chinese hacking
community. During that time period, the Chinese
hacking community engaged in website
defacements and denial of service attacks in
conjunction with incidents such as the accidental
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in
1999, the collision of a U.S. spy plane and a
Chinese military plane in 2001, and the Japanese
Prime Minister's controversial visit to the
Yasukuni shrine in 2005''* Around this time a
significant shift in philosophy began to take place.
Members of the Chinese hacking community that
participated in such attacks soon found that
transitioning to cyber espionage was more
rewarding—both in terms of developing a more
advanced skill set as well as in monetary
remuneration. One group known as NCPH
(Network Crack Program Hacker), whose
founding member "Wicked/Withered Rose” was a
patriotic hacker, made the transition to cyber
espionage by founding a "hacker-for-hire" group

that simultaneously developed an association with
the Chinese miiitaryd The group began developing
zerO“day exploits, rootkits and remote access
tools (RATs)—using them In attacks against a
variety of targets including the U.S. Department of
Defense^ (One of this group's associates, “whg", is
still active and is believed to have developed one
variant of the PlugX/SOGU malware.^) The
rationale behind this transition within the Chinese
hacking community is nicely summed up in a
message by the "Honker Union of China" to its
members in 2010:
What benefit can hacking a Web page bring our
country and the people? It is only a form of
emotional catharsis, please do not launch any
pointless attacks, the real attack is to fatally
damage their network or gain access to their
sensitive information.**
In Iran, the hacking community appears to be
undergoing a similar transformation. While a
variety of Iranian hacker groups had engaged in
politically motivated website defacements, the
emergence of the "Iranian Cyber Army" in 2009
demonstrated “a concentrated effort to promote
the Iranian government's political narrative
oniine'C They targeted, among others, news
organizations, opposition websites and social
media.*** This marked the beginning of a largescale cyber offensive against the perceived
enemies of the Iranian government.

5

Foreign news and opposition websites are
routinely blocked in Iran, as are the tools that
allow users In Iran to bypass these restrictions.'*’
One of the key stakeholders in Iran's Internet
censorship program is the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard Corps (I RGC), under which the Basij
paramilitary organization operates.
The Basij formed the Basij Cyber Council and
actively recruits hackers in order to develop both
defensive and offensive cyber capabilities.*** There
is increasing evidence to suggest that the hacker
community in Iran is engaged in a transition from
politically motivated defacements and denial of
service attacks to cyber espionage activities. This
model is consistent with the Basij's recruitment of
paramilitary volunteer hackers to “engage in less
complex hacking or infiltration operations" leaving
the more technical operations to entities over
which they have increasingly direct control 13
As such, the capabilities of threat actors operating
from Iran have traditionally been considered
limited.*'* However, the "Shamoon" attacks, which
wiped computers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar,
indicate an improvement in capabilities.**’And
unsurprisingly, Iran has reportedly increased its
efforts to improve offensive capabilities after
being targeted by Stuxnet and Flame. 16

Attack Vectors
We have observed the Ajax Security Team use a
variety of vectors to lure targets into installing
malicious software and/or revealing login
credentials. These attack vectors include sending
email, private messages via social media, fake login
pages, and the propagation of anti-censorship
software that has been infected with malware.

During our investigation, we discovered that these
attackers sent targeted emails, as well as private
messages through social media. For example, the
attackers targeted companies in the DIB usinga
fake conference page as a lure to trick targets into
installing malicious software. The attackers

registered the domain ''aeroconf2014[.]org" in
order to impersonate the IEEE Aerospace
conference—the conference's actual domain is
aeroconf.org—and sent out an email with the
following information:
From: invite@aeroconf2014[.]org
Subject: IEEE Aerospace Conference 2014
The email encouraged users to visit a fake
conference website owned by the attackers:
Upon visiting the website, visitors were notified
that they must install "proxy” software in order to
access it, which is actually malware.

The attackers have also used phishing attacks, in
which they set up Web pages to emulate various
services that require security credentials. The
attackers tailored these login pages for specific
targets in the DIB and spoofed a variety of services
such as Outlook Web Access and VPN login pages.
If users attempt to login through these fake Web
pages, the attackers collect their login credentials.

All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Iran are
required to implement filtering technology that
censors access to content which the I ranian
government deems unacceptable.” This content
includes categories such as pornography and

political opposition,’** In response to these
restrictions, Iranians have been increasingly using
software that bypasses such filtering technology.
To counter anti-censorship efforts, I ran has
attempted to block the use of certain software
tools.” in 2012, researchers found that an
anti-censorship tool that is primarily used by
Internet users in Iran was bundled with malware
and redistributed.^**
Our investigation found that malware-laden
versions of legitimate anti-censorship software,
such as Psiphon and Uitrasurf, were distributed to
users Iran and Persian speaking people around the
world.

The “Stealer" Malware
Host-based Indicators and Malware
Functionality
We have observed the Ajax Security Team use a
malware family that they identify simply as 'Stealer',
They deliver this malware as a malicious executable
(dropper). The executable is a CAB extractor that
drops the implant lntelRS,exe, This implant, in turn,
drops various other components into C:\
Documents and Settings\[USER}\Application
Data\lntelRapidStart\. The following files are
written to disk in this location:

The lntelRS,exe is written in ,NET and is aptly
named "Stealer”, as it has various data collection
modules. It drops and launches AppTransferWiz,dll
via the following command:
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32,exe" "C:\
Documents and Settings\{USERl\Appiication
Data\lntelRapidStart\AppTransferWiz,dii”,#110

Data exfiltration is conducted over FTP by
AppTransferWiz.dll, which acts as an FTP client.
This DLL is written in Delphi. There is code to
exfiltrate data over FITTP POST as well, but it is
unused. We also found incomplete code that would
perform SFTP and SMTP exfiltration, which could
be completed in a future version.

Takes various screenshots
Fiarvests instant messaging (IM) account
information: GTalk, Pidgin, Yahoo, Skype
Tracks credentials, bookmarks and history
from major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera

State is maintained between the stealer
component lntelRS.exe and the FTP component
AppTransferWiz.DLL using a file from the FTP
server "sqlite3.dll", as well as a global atom
“SQLiteFinish". lntelRS.exe waits in an indefinite
loop, until AppTransferWiz.DLL defines this state.

Collects email account information
Extracts installed proxy software

lntelRS.exe loads a Delphi component called
DelphiNative.DLL, which implements some
additional data theft functionality for the following:

The Stealer component uses common techniques
to acquire credential data. For instance, it loads
vaultcii.DLL and uses various APIs shown below to
acquire RDP accounts from the Windows vauit.
Harvested data is encrypted and written to disk on
the local host. The filenames for these encrypted
files follow this naming scheme:
(stolen data typejjvictim system name)
YYYYMMDD_HFIMM,Enc
The (stolen data type) parameter indicates where
the data was harvested from (e.g., a Web browser,
an instant messenger application, installed proxy
software).

Analysis of the malware indicates that the data is
encrypted via a Rijndael cipher implementation;
more specifically it uses AES which is a specific set
of configurations of Rijndael. It uses a key size of
256 bytes and block size of 128 bytes, which
conforms to the FIPS-197 specification of
AES-256.^' it utilizes the passphrase 'FiavijeBaba'
and a salt of 'sa!am!’%#’ as an input to PBKDF2
(Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to
derive the key and initialization vector for the
encryption,This key derivation implementation in
.NET is done using the Rfc2898DeriveBytes
dass.^^ The passphrase and salt are Persian
language words. "Havij" means "carrot". “Baba"
means "father", and "Saiam" is a common greeting
that means “Peace",

Analysis of the PDB strings seen in the implants
indicates that there may be more than one
developer working on the source code for the
Stealer builder. The following two PDB paths were
seen in the collection of implants that we
collected:
d :\svn\Stea lerXsou rce\Stealer\Stea ler\obj\

f:\Projects\C#\Steaier\source\Stealer\

These strings indicate that the Stealer source
code was stored in two different paths but not
necessarily on two different computers. The f:\
ProjectsX path may be from an external storage
device such as a thumb drive. It is therefore
possible that only one person has access to the
source code, but keeps a separate repository on
an external storage device. Alternatively, the
different file paths could be the result of two
different actors storing their source code in two
different locations.

The "Stealer" Builder and Tools
During our research, we recovered two different
tools used by the members of the Ajax Security
Team in conjunction with targeted intrusion
activities. The first too!, labeled the 'Stealer Builder'
was compiled on 2014-04-08. This compile date
may indicate that the group is still active.
Upon executing the 'Stealer Builder’ the user is
presented with an option to load the 'Builder' or to
'Decrypt' logs generated from a victim and
exfiitrated to a command-and-control (CnC) server
under the groups' control.

The Builder option enables an attacker to
configure a new Stealer backdoor. The user can
configure the new backdoor to connect to a
specific CnC server with a personalized username
and password. The attacker can bind the backdoor
to a legitimate application of his or her choosing, or
they can cloak it with an icon designed to make the
backdoor appear as though it is a legitimate file.
We also noted that the Builder did not allow the
attacker to select a new passphrase or salt used to
encrypt the stolen data. The passphrase
'HavijeBaba' and a salt of 'salam!'‘%#’ are both
hardcoded into the builder.

During testing, we observed that backdoors

We also recovered a tool designed to encode
plaintext into Base64 encoded text or decode

Base64 encoded text into plaintext. Members of
the Ajax Security Team likely this use tool to
encode the configuration data seen in
RapidStartTech.sti files. As noted above, the
RapidStartTech.sti contains the backdoor’s FTP
credentials, implant name, decoy name, and
screenshot interval, along with boolean settings for
startup, keylogger, and screenshot plugins.
Encoding and decoding Base64 data is a
straightforward task and the standard Linux
operating system offers a number of command line
tools to achieve this task. The presence of a
Windows-based GUI tool that simplifies encoding
and decoding Base64 data indicates that these
tools may have been developed for less adept
users.

Command-and-Control Infrastructure
The CnC infrastructure consists of distinct, but
linked, clusters that have targeted both the users
of anti-censorship tools in Iran as well as defense
contractor companies in the U.S.
The first cluster contains the domain used in the
Aerospace Conference attack as welI as the
domains used in phishing attacks designed to
capture user credentials:

Figure 11: Ajax Security
Team's Phishing
Infrastructure

The website used in the Aerospace Conference
attack was aeroconf2014[.]org, which is registered
to info@usa.gov[.]us. However, historical WHOIS
information shows that the domain was registered
by keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail[.]com-the same domain
used to register ajaxtm[.]org, the website of the
Ajax Security Team. The same email addresses
were used to register variations of domain names
associated with popular services provided by
companies such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo and
Linkedin.

which were registered by james.mateo@aim[.]com.

connecting to these domains.

Victimology
During our investigation, we were able to recover
information on 77 victims from one CnC server
that we discovered while analyzing malware
samples that were disguised as anti-censorship
tools. While analyzing the data from the victims, we

15 www.fireeye.com

found that the majority had either their timezone
set to "Iran Standard Time" or had their language
setting set to Persian:
44 had their timezone sot to "Iran Standard
Time” (37 of those also have their language set
to Persian)
Of the remaining 33,10 have Persian
language settings
12 have either Proxifier or Psiphon installed
or running (all 12 had a Persian language
setting and all but one had their timezone set
to “Iran Standard Time")
The largest concentration of victims is in Iran,
based on the premise that Persian language
settings and “Iran Standard Time" correlate the
victim to be geographically located in Iran. As such,
we believe that attackers disguised malware as
anti-censorship tools in order to target the users of
such tools inside Iran as well as Iranian dissidents
outside the country.

The Ajax Security Team appears to have been
formed by personas named "HUrr!c4nE!" and
“CairSx" in 20104'* Both members were engaged in
website defacements prior to the forming of the
Ajax Security Team, and both were members of
Iranian hacker forums such as ashiyanej.jorg and
shabgardj.jorg. Other members include "Oday",
"Mohammad PK" and “CrimSr". The Ajax Security
Team website at ajaxtmj.jorg had a Web forum
with at least 236 members. The group published

Figure 14: Cair3x's original

several exploits for content management systems
and engaged in defacements.^^ Initially, the
defacements seemed to be motivated by a desire
to demonstrate the group's prowess—they even
defaced an Iranian government website. 26
However, the group appears to have become
increasingly political. For example, in a blog post in
2012, “Cair3x" announced the targeting of Iran's
political opponents.

Hello to everyone, After a while of operating underground
and enhancing our company's projects and getting close to
24 June 2012, and the martyrdom of Ayatollah Dr. Beheshti
and 72 of Imam Khomeini's (First and Former supreme
leader of Iran) followers, we have planned a project/
initiative to attack anti-revolution and political
websites against the Islamic Republic. And in late hours
of Wednesday, June 24, 2012, we attacked these websites
and defaced them by writing the words “We are young but
we can" on their websites. This is so the enemies of this
country know that the blood of our martyr will never be
in vain and they will always be remembered in the heart
of gallant Iranians.

By 'March 2010 HUrrlc4nEl was identifying as a member of Ajax Security Team in exploit releases http:/A'Vww.cxploil-db.com/exploits/17011/ and the

In 2013, the Ajax Security Team, and "HUrr!c4nE I”
in particular, took part in ''#Oplsraer’ and
“#OpUSA’'.27
By early 2014, the Ajax Security Team appears to
have dwindled. There have been no defacements
since December 2013. The website and forum at
ajaxtm[.jorg operated by "HUrr!c4nE!“, aka
"k3yv4n”, is no longer active.

"HUrr!c4nE!" has the most open/documented
Internet persona of the Ajax Security Team. He
registered the ajaxtmltjorg domain name using the
email address keyvan,ajaxtm@gmaii[.]com. This
was also the email address used to register the
domain aerospace2014[.]org, which was used in
spear phishing attacks against companies in the
U.S. and is linked with malware activity directed at
users of anti-censorship tools in Iran.

''HUrr!c4nE!” features prominently in aii the
group's activities and defacements. Although there
has been a decline in public-facing Ajax Security
Team activity, this coincides with an increase in
malware activity linked to the group's
infrastructure.

• 2010“ 2012“Defacements, Release of exploits

• 2012 - 2013—Increasing politicization,
participation on #Oplsrael, #OpUSA
• 2013 - 2014—Transition to cyber-espionage
The increasing politicization of the Ajax Security
Team aligns with the timing of their activities
against the perceived enemies of Iran. In addition
to attacking companies in the U.S., they have
targeted domestic users of anti-censorship
technology.
While the objectives of this group are consistent
with Iran's efforts at controlling political dissent
and expanding offensive cyber capabilities, the
relationship between this group and the Iranian
government remains inconclusive.

For example, the Ajax Security Team could just be
using anti-censorship tools as a lure because they
are popular in Iran, in order to engage in activities
that would be considered traditional cybercrime. In
one case, "HUrrlcAnEI", using the email address
keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail[,]com, has been flagged for
possible fraud by an online retailer. While
“EfUrr!c4nE!" is engaged in operations that align
with Iran's political objectives, he may also be
dabbling in traditional cybercrime.
This indicates that there is a considerable grey area
between the cyber espionage capabilities of Iran's
hacker groups and any direct Iranian government
or military involvement.
On the spectrum of state responsibility, these
attacks align with state-encouraged attacks, which
are defined as attacks in which:
Third parties control and conduct the attack, but
the national government encourages them as a
matter of policy. 28
Recruiting hackers through this model allows Iran
to influence their activities, and provides the
Iranian government plausible deniability, but a lack
of direct control also means that the groups may be
unpredictable and engage in unsanctioned attacks.

Conclusion

About FireEye

The increased politicization of the Ajax Security
Team, and the transition from nuisance
defacements to operations against internal
dissidents and foreign targets, coincides with
moves by Iran aimed at increasing offensive cyber
capabilities. While the relationship between actors
such as the Ajax Security Team and the Iranian
government is unknown, their activities appear to
align with Iranian government poiitica! objectives.

FireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual
machine-based security platform that provides
real-time threat protection to enterprises and
governments worldwide against the next
generation of cyber attacks. These highly
sophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent
traditional signature-based defenses, such as
next-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and
gateways. The FireEye Threat Prevention Platform
provides real-time, dynamic threat protection
without the use of signatures to protect an
organization across the primary threat vectors and
across the different stages of an attack life cycle.

The capabilities of the Ajax Security Team remain
unclear. This group uses at least one malware
family that is not publicly available. We have not
directly observed the Ajax Security Team use
exploits to deliver malware, but it is unclear if they
or other Iranian actors are capable of producing or
acquiring exploit code.
While the Ajax Security Team’s capabilities remain
unclear, we know that their current operations
have been somewhat successful as measured by
the number of victims seen checking into to an Ajax
Security Team controlled CnC server. We believe
that if these actors continue the current pace of
their operations they will improve their capabilities
in the mid-term.

The core of the FireEye platform is a virtual
execution engine, complemented by dynamic
threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber
attacks in real time. FireEye has over 1,500

The Return of The Charming Kitten
A review of the latest wave of organized phishing attacks by Iranian state-backed
hackers

Welcome

The Return of The Charming Kitten

{■’C

Abstract
Phishing attacks are the most common form of infiltration used by Iranian state-backed
hackers to gain access into accounts. Certfa reviews the latest campaign of phishing
attacks that has been carried out and dubbed as “The Return of The Charming Kitten”.
In this campaign, hackers have targeted individuals who are involved in economic and
military sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran as well as politicians, civil and

human rights activists and journalists around the world.
Our review in Certfa demonstrates that the hackers - knowing that their victims use twostep verification - target verification codes and also their email accounts such as Yahoo!
and Gmail. As a result, Certfa believes the safest existing way to confront these attacks
is using Security Keys such as YubiKey.

Introduction
In early October 2018, MDOugh, a Twitter user'', revealed phishing attacks of a group of
Iranian hackers against US financial institution infrastructure. According to this user,
these attacks could possibly be a reaction to new sanctions against Iran.
The account mentioned a domain with the address accounts[-]support[.]services for the
first time. This domain is linked to a group of hackers who are supported by the Iranian
government, and that we believe have close ties with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps (IRGC). ClearSky^ has previously published detailed reports on their activities.
A month after these attacks, the administrators of accounts-support[.]services expanded
their activities and started targeting civil and human rights activists, political figures and
also Iranian and Western journalists.

Methods of Attacks
Cur investigation illustrates that the attackers are utilising different methods to carry out
their attacks. These methods can be put into two categories:

The Return of The Charming Kitten - Certfa Blog

1. Phishing attacks through unknown email or social media and messaging accounts
2. Phishing attacks through email or social media and messaging accounts of public
figures, which have been hacked by the attackers
We have also found that the hackers have collected information on their targets prior to
the phishing attack. The hackers design specific plans for each target based on the level
of targets’ cyber knowledge, their contacts, activities, working time, and their geographic
situation.
We also noticed that, unlike in previous phishing campaigns, in some cases the hackers
did not change the password of their victims’ accounts in these latest attacks. This
allows them to remain undetected and monitor a victim’s communications via their email
in real time.

Fake alerts of unauthorised access
According to the samples of phishing attacks, the main trick used by these hackers to
deceive their targets is that of sending fake alerts through email addresses such as
notifications. maiiservices@gmaii[.]com, norepiy. customermails@gmail[.]com,
customer]email-deiivery[.]info etc. stating that unauthorised individuals have tried to
access their accounts.

By using this method, attackers pretend that the email provider has sent security alerts
to the targets and they should immediately review and restrict suspicious accesses.
More details are available in the “Destination Link” section.

Fake file sharing on Google Drive
Sending links with titles such as share files from Google Drive has been one of the most
common tricks that hackers have used in recent years. A unique point of these attacks
in comparison with the previous ones is that they use Google Site^, which allows the
hackers to show a fake download page of Google Drive, which tricks the users into
thinking it’s a real Google Drive page.

For example, the hacker had used hxxps://sites.google[.]com/view/sharingdrivesystem
to deceive the users and convince them the page is the authentic Google Drive as users
can see google.com in the address bar of their browsers. Certfa has reported this link
and similar links to Google and Google has now terminated them.
By creating websites with the same design and look of Google Drive file sharing page,
hackers pretend to be sharing a file with the user, which they should download and run it
on their devices. They use hacked Twitter, Facebook and Telegram accounts to send
these links and target new users. The truth is there is not any file and the hackers use
this page to direct their targets to the fake Google login page, which the users enter
their credential details including 2 factor authentication.

The Attack Structure
Most of these attacks are currently occurring through phishing emails. As a result, it
would be useful to take a look the original content in recent phishing campaigns.

1. Destination fink
1.1. Trusted Stage: Internet users around the world consider Google’s main domain
(google.com) to be a safe and secure address. The attackers misuse this fact and
create fake pages on sites.google.com (which is a subdomain of Google) to deceive
their targets. Google’s Site service gives its users an ability to show various contents on
it. The attackers use this ability to send fake alerts and redirect their targets to insecure
websites or embedded phishing pages as a iframe on those pages.

Most users can easily detect the phishing website by looking at
the domain names and full URLs.

google.com
Attackers use Google's Site Service, which allows them to
create web pages under site.google.com, to send safe and
secure looking links to their targets.

google.com
After creating websites on Google's Site service, the attackers
send links to their targets. These link can redirect their targets
to malicious websites or steal their data directly.

1.2. Untrusted Stage: Since Google can quickly recognise and eliminate suspicious
and malicious links on sites.google.com, the hackers use their own website. The links of
phishing websites have similar patterns to a previous phishing campaign which was
launched in the past years. For example, attackers use words such as “management”,
customize”, “service”, “identification”, “session”, “confirm” etc. in the domains name and
phishing URLs to deceive users who want to verify their website addresses.

2. Clickable image in emails
The hackers use an image, instead of texts, in the body of their emails, to bypass
Google’s security and anti-phishing system. For this purpose, attackers have also used

third party services such as Firefox Screenshot"^ to host their email images.

3. Hidden tracking image on emails
The attackers use a separate hidden image in the body of the email to notify them when
their targets open the email. This trick helps the hackers to act immediately after the
target opens the email and clicks on the phishing link.

Phishing Pages
Apart from the content structure of the emails and phishing links, we are sure that
attackers use a customized platform to create and store users’ credential details. We
have also noticed that they have designed the phishing pages for both desktop and
mobile versions of Google and Yahoo! mail services and they might use other services
in the future.

An interesting technique they have used in recent attacks was once their target enters
their username and password, attackers check those credentials on-the-fly and if that
information was given correctly, they then ask for 2-step verification code.
In other words, they check victims’ usernames and passwords in realtime on their own
servers, and even if 2 factor authentication such as text message, authenticator app or
one-tap login are enabled they can trick targets and steal that information too.
Figures 6 to 9 demonstrate some examples of the phishing pages, which have been
sent to the targets by the Iranian hackers.

Hacker’s Footprints
Our primary reviews of the phishing websites linked to this campaign show that hackers
have set up a remarkable number of domains. Our latest findings show that for this
phishing campaign in a relatively short period of time, (September to November 2018),
they have used more than 20 domain names. The number of phishing domains has
increased at the time of writing this report. Closer investigation of these servers
revealed how their network of domain names have been used in recent attacks.

Moreover, our technical reviews reveal that the individuals, who are involved in this
cannpaign used Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxies with Dutch and French IP
addresses to hide their original location. In spite of their efforts, we have uncovered
enough evidence to prove that the attackers were using their real IP addresses (i.e
89.198.179[.]103 and 31.2.213[.] 18 from Iran during the preparation phase of their
campaign).
Also, some domain names and servers of this campaign are very similar to the
methods, techniques and targets that been used by Charming Kitten, a group of hackers
who are linked to the Iranian government. Consequently, we believe Charming Kitten
and the Iranian hacker(s) belonging to this group have returned and launched new
cyber attacks against various people around the world and with more focus on Israeli
and American citizens.

Conclusion
Phishing attacks are the most popular method of stealing data and hacking account
amongst Iranian hackers, but the most significant fact about this campaign is its timing.
This campaign launched weeks before 4 November 2018 which is when the U.S.
imposed new sanctions on Iran. This campaign tries to collect information by infiltrating
the accounts of non-Iranian political figures and authorities who work on economic and
military sanctions against Iran.

In other words, hackers who are supported by the Iranian government pick their targets
according to policies and international interests for the Iranian government and also
where Iran wants to have impact indirectly.
A a result, we propose a series of recommendations to tech companies, policymakers,
civil society actors and internet users to effectively lessen the threat of this type of attack
and even thwart them.
Our recommendations to tech companies and policy makers:
* Stop using 2 factor authentication by text plain message/SMS.
« Start using Security Keys (i.e. YubiKey) for 2 factor authentication for high ranking
individuals who have sensitive jobs or activities.
• Do not use one-tap login verification process.
Our recommendations to civil society and the Iranian diaspora media:
• Inform employees and colleagues about any phishing threats and encourage them
to use Security Keys such as Yubikey for 2 factor authentication and activate
Google’s Advanced Protection Program.
• Always use company and institution email accounts instead of personal email for

DECLARATION OF GABRIEL M. RAMSEY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
PROTECTIVE ORDER TEMPQIUIRILY SEALING DOCUMENTS
I, Gabriel M, Ramsey, declare as follow:
1.

I am an attorney admitted to practice in the State of California and the District of

Columbia. 1 am a partner at the law firm of Crowell & Moring LLP (“CrowelF’), counsel of record
for the Plaintiff m this matter, Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”). I make this declaration in
support of Microsoft’s Motion for a Protective Order 'I'cmporarily Sealing Documents. I have
personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration and, if called to testify as a witness,
could and would testify to the following under oath.
2,

This case arises out of the harmful and malicious Internet activities of DefendantS

John Does 1 and 2 (collectively “Defendants”). I am informed and on that basis believe that
Defendants are sophisticated cybercriminals who specialize in stealing sensitive information from
computer networks. I am informed and on that basis believe that Defendants make unauthorized
access to Microsoft’s services and software, hack into a target’s computer network, and in
1

particular Microsoft’s software, install malware on those networks giving them long-term and
surreptitious access to those networks, and then locate and exfiltratc sensitive information from
them.
3.

I am informed and believe that, for reasons explained in detail in the declaration of

David Anselmi In Support Of Microsoft’s Application For Temporary Restraining Order And
Order To Show Cause For Preliminary Injunction (“TRO Application”), filed contemporaneously
herewith, permitting Defendants to learn of these proceedings prior to execution of the temporary
ex parte relief sought in Microsoft’s Motion For Preliminary Injunction Order-—in particular the
portion to disable the domains in Appendix A to that Order

would preclude Microsoft’s ability to

obtain effective relief against Defendants. This is because Defendants are highly sophisticated
cybercriminals capable of quickly adapting the command and control infrastructure used to
perpetrate Defendants unlawful conduct in order to overcome Microsoft's remediation efforts.
4.

1 am informed and believe that, absent a protective order, there is a substantial risk

that Defendants will learn of these proceedings before the temporary ex parte relief to disable the
domains in Appendix A to the Preliminary Injunction Order can be effected and will take steps to
evade the relief sought.
5

Over the past nine years, I, on behalf of Microsoft, have been involved with

prosecuting twelve similar cases. 1 he.se cases all involved similar litigation strategies and claims
and have involved John Doe defendants conducting illegal activities through identifiable but
movable online command and control infrastructures similar to that used by Phosphorus. In several
of those cases, I personally observed that defendants also immediately took action to attempt to
defy and evade the court’s order as soon as they detected legal action being taken against them.
6.

Thus, given Defendants’ defiance of this Court’s injunctive orders and my past

experience with cases with very similar circumstance as those here, it is my belief that even
2

disclosing that Microsoft has requested a Preliminary Injunctive Order to disable the domains at
Appendix A to that order gives Defendants the opportunity to adapt the command and control
infrastructure so that they can continue to peipctrate their unlawful conduct. For this reason,
Microsoft respectfully requests that all documents filed in this case be temporarily sealed.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing iIS
true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Executed on this 14th day of March 2019, in
Washington, D.C

Before the Court is Microsoft’s Motion for a Protective Order Temporarily Sealing
Documents. Upon consideration of the Motion, the pleadings filed herein, and the arguments of
counsel, the Court finding that the arguments of applicable rules and District of Columbia Circuit

maintained UNDER SEAL in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1) and Local Civil Rule 5,
pending execution of the ex parte relief requested in Microsoft’s Motion to Supplement

1. The instant Motion for Protective Order Temporarily Sealing Documents
and accompanying documents, including the Brief in support of this

1

Motion;
2. The declaration of Gabriel M. Ramsey in Support of Motion for Protective
Order Sealing Documents;
3. Microsoft’s Ex Parte Motion For Preliminary Injunction Order and
accompanying documents;
4. The Declaration of David Anselmi in Support of Microsoft’s Ex Parte Motion
For Preliminary Injunction Order and attachments thereto;
5.

[Proposed] Preliminary Injunction Order and accompanying documents.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, immediately upon execution of the ex parte relief
disabling the domains set forth at Appendix A, sought in Microsoft’s Motion to Supplemental
Preliminary Injunction Order, Microsoft shall file with the Clerk of the Court a Notice that the
Supplemental Preliminary Injunction Order has been executed, and the Clerk of the Court upon
receiving such Notice shall file the foregoing documents on the public docket. Microsoft shall be
permitted to disclose any such material as deemed necessary to commence its efforts to provide
Defendants notice of any further hearings and service of pleadings associated with Motion To
Supplement Preliminary Injunction Order.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Case: 1:19-cv-00716 (JURY-DEMAND)
Assigned To ; Amy B. Jackson
Assign. Date : 3/14/2019
Description: TRO/PI

MICROSOFT CORPORATION,
Plaintiff,
V.

Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell
JOHN DOES 1-2,
Defendants.
ORDER
Pending before the Court is plaintiff Microsoft Corp.’s Motion for a Temporary Sealing
Order related to its instant action seeking an ex parte preliminary injunction. See LCvR 40.7(f)
(stating that the Chief Judge shall “hear and determine ... motions in any case not already
assigned” including “motion[s] to seal the complaint”); see also LCvR 5.1(h)(1) (“Absent
statutory authority, no case or document may be sealed without an order from the Court.”). The
motion is granted, subject to any further consideration by the United States District Judge to
whom this case is randomly assigned.
I.

LEGAL STANDARD
The starting point in considering a motion to seal court records is a strong presumption

in favor of public access to judicial proceedings.” Hardaway v. D.C. Hous. Autk, 843 F.3d 973,
980 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting EEOC v. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., Inc., 98 F.3d 1406, 1409 (D.C.
Cir. 1996)). Courts should consider six factors, originally identified in United States v. Hubbard,
650 F.2d 293 (D.C. Cir. 1980), in determining whether that presumption may be overcome.
including;
(1) the need for public access to the documents at issue; (2) the extent of previous
public access to the documents; (3) the fact that someone has objected to disclosure.
1 .

and the identity of that person; (4) the strength of any property and privacy interests
asserted; (5) the possibility of prejudice to those opposing disclosure; and (6) the
purposes for which the documents were introduced during the judicial
proceedings.”
Metlife, Inc. v. Fin. Stability Oversight Council, 865 F.3d 661, 665 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting
Natl Children’s Ctr.,9?>V .3d dX 1409 (citing

650 F.2d at 317-22)). In“motionsto

seal or unseal judicial records, the Hubbard test has consistently served as our lodestar because it
ensures that we fully account for the various public and private interests at stake,” Metlife, Inc.,
865 F.3d at 666.
IL

DISCUSSION
The plaintiff, Microsoft, requests temporary sealing of its pleadings associated with the

instant ex parte Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. PL’s Mot. for Sealing Order (“PL’s Mot.”)
at 1. Microsoft has filed the motion for a preliminary injunction “to prevent the activities of
[defendants John Does 1 and 2] who are engaged in harmful and malicious Internet activities
directed at Microsoft, its customers, and the general public.” Pi’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for
Sealing Order (“PL’s Mem.”) at 1. Specifically, Microsoft seeks to “disable the recent registered
domains set forth in Appendix A to [its] Complaint,” id. and warns that “advance public
disclosure or notice of that requested relief would allow Defendants to evade such relief and
further prosecution of this action, thereby perpetuating the irreparable harm at issue,” id. at 1—2.
Microsoft avers that its “rights and interests in protecting its ability to obtain ex parte temporary
relief, and the necessity of sealing its pleadings in order to effectively disable the domains .. ., is
paramount over any competing public interest to immediate access to the information Microsoft
requests to be sealed.” Id. at 4 (emphasis in original).
Moreover, Microsoft suggests that if its “papers are not sealed, the relief sought would
very likely be rendered fruitless, and there is a substantial risk Defendants [elsewhere referred to
. 2

as ‘highly sophisticated cybercriminals’] would destroy evidence.” Id. Microsoft points to past
experience suggesting that when the “defendants become aware of efforts to mitigate or
investigate their activities, they take steps to conceal their activities and to conceal the injury
caused to their victims, making it more difficult for their victims to adequately assess the damage
or take steps to mitigate that injury.

Id. at 5. This experience “underscores the risk that the

Defendants in this case will take similar steps to destroy evidence and move their eommand and
control infrastructure ... if they are given notice of the” instant aetion. Id.
Microsoft notes that it “only seeks to seal [its pleadings] for a limited period oftime, until
after effective ex parte temporary relief has been obtained, disabling the domains.. .. [after
which] all documents will be unsealed and the public will be given full access to these
proceedings.” See id. at 6. If the United States District Judge to whom this case is assigned
grants Microsoft’s request to disable the defendants’ domains, Microsoft proposes to file a
Notice with the Clerk of the Court when that order is executed, at which point the pleadings in
this matter may be unsealed. Id. at 2, 6; Pl.’s Mot. at 2.
At this early stage of the litigation, the Court is persuaded that the plaintiff has met its
burden of showing that the interests in temporarily sealing this case outweigh the public interest
in disclosure because sealing is necessary in order to protect evidence and to prevent the
defendants from taking steps to conceal their activities or any injuries caused to plaintiff or
others. Therefore, the Court grants the plaintiffs motion to seal this case.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby
ORDERED that the plaintiffs Motion for a Temporary Sealing Order is GRANTED;

and it is further

3

ORDERED that this action, and all papers and pleadings filed in connection therewith,
shall remain sealed until further Order of the Court; and it is further
ORDERED that the plaintiff will be expected to discuss its proposal for the process of
lifting the sealing order at the first scheduled Court conference on this matter.
SO ORDERED,
Date; March 14, 2019
