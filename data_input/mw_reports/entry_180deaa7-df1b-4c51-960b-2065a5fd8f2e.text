The Board,
HSE,
Dr Steevens’ Hospital,
Dublin 8, Ireland

03 December 2021
									
Subject : Post Incident Review into the Ransomware Cyber Attack

Dear Chair,
The Board of the Health Service Executive (“HSE”) in conjunction with the Chief Executive Office (“CEO”) and
the Executive Management Team (“EMT”) have requested an independent review into the recent ransomware
cyber attack (the “Incident”) and the circumstances surrounding this exfiltration of data from the HSE’s
Information Technology (“IT”) systems. The purpose of the review is to:
- Urgently establish the facts in relation to the current preparedness of the HSE in terms of both its
technical preparedness (Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”) systems, cyber and
information protections) and its operational preparedness (including Business Continuity Management
planning) for a strategic risk of this nature.
- Identify the learnings from this Incident to identify improvements to the HSE’s preparedness for
and response to other major risks including immediate risks and incidents that cause major business
disruption.
- Share those learnings within the HSE and externally with State and non-State organisations to inform
their future preparedness.
Save as described in our contract or as expressly agreed by us in writing, we accept no liability (including for
negligence) to anyone else or for any other purpose in connection with this report.
The subject matter and volume of information we reviewed as part of this process has been complex and
significant in nature. Similarly, the timeline against which the review has been conducted has been challenging
and has only been achieved with the cooperation of the many stakeholders involved, for which we are
appreciative.
Yours faithfully,

Executive summary
Background
The Health Service Executive (“HSE”) is a large
geographically spread organisation which provides all
of Ireland’s public health services through hospitals
and communities across the country. The HSE
consists of approximately 4,000 locations, 54 acute
hospitals and over 70,000 devices (PCs, laptops,
etc). Services are provided through both community
delivered care and care provided through the hospital
system as well as the national ambulance service.
Corporate services and other services that support
healthcare delivery are provided through the national
centre.
The HSE is the largest employer in the Irish state, with
over 130,000 staff including direct employees and
those employed by organisations funded by the HSE1.
It therefore comprises an extensive community who
are increasingly dependent on connected and reliable
Information Technology (“IT”) solutions and varying
levels of IT support from the HSE national centre
to deliver clinical services. This includes the HSE’s
national IT infrastructure. The HSE is classified as a
critical infrastructure operator under the EU Network
and Information Security Directive (“NISD”)2, also
known as an Operator of Essential Services (“OES”).

Introduction to the Incident
In the early hours of Friday 14 May 2021, the HSE
was subjected to a serious cyber attack, through the
criminal infiltration of their IT systems (PCs, servers,
etc.) using Conti ransomware. The HSE invoked its
Critical Incident Process, which began a sequence of
events leading to the decision to switch off all HSE
IT systems and disconnect the National Healthcare
Network (“NHN”) from the internet, in order to attempt
to contain and assess the impact of the cyber
attack3. These actions removed the threat actor’s (the
“Attacker”) access to the HSE’s environment.
This immediately resulted in healthcare professionals
losing access to all HSE provided IT systems including patient information systems, clinical
care systems and laboratory systems. Non-clinical
systems such as financial systems, payroll and
procurement systems were also lost. Significant

disruption immediately occurred and many healthcare
professionals had to revert to pen and paper to
continue patient care. Healthcare services across
the country were severely disrupted with real and
immediate consequences for the thousands of people
who require health services every day.
Normal communication channels, both at HSE’s
national centre and within operational services
were also immediately lost. This included email
and networked phone lines. Staff switched to
communicating using mobile and analogue phones;
fax; and face to face meetings.
The aim of the Attacker was to disrupt health services
and IT systems, steal data, and demand a ransom for
the non-publication of stolen data and provision of a
tool to restore access to data they had encrypted.
The HSE initially requested the assistance of the
Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, the International
Criminal Police Organisation (“Interpol”) and the
National Cyber Security Centre (“NCSC”) to support
the response. The ransomware created ransom notes
with instructions on how to contact the Attacker. The
Attacker also posted a message on an internet chat
room on the dark web, with a link to several samples
of data reportedly stolen from the HSE. The HSE and
the Irish Government confirmed on the day of the
attack that they would not pay a ransom4.
The Incident had a far greater and more protracted
impact on the HSE than initially expected, with
recovery efforts continuing for over four months.5

Growing threat of cyber attacks
Cybercrime is increasing in frequency, magnitude
and sophistication, with cybercriminals easily
operating across jurisdictions and country borders.
These incidents can cause major damage to safety
and the economy6. As outlined in Ireland’s National
Cyber Security Strategy, 2019-2024, “recent years
have seen the development and regular use of
very advanced tools for cyber enabled attacks and
espionage, and, likely for the first time, the physical
destruction of Critical National Infrastructure by cyber
enabled means”7. In April 2020, Interpol, warned
that cybercriminals were targeting critical healthcare
institutions with ransomware8.

Ransomware attacks have risen significantly over the
last few years. Whilst precise figures on the number
of ransomware victims are not available, there are
statistics that indicate the rate of growth of these
attacks. For example, the US agency FinCEN’s9
analysis of ransomware-related Suspicious Activity
Reports (SARs) filed during the first half of 2021
indicates that $590 million10 was paid in ransomwarerelated transactions (likely representing payments
originating from the US to ransomware groups),
which exceeds the value reported for the entirety of
2020 ($416 million).

community, focusing on how the HSE’s strategy was
implemented at tactical levels and the effectiveness
of the HSE’s coordination of efforts.

Despite claims by ransomware groups that they
would not seek to harm people, there are several
recent examples of attacks against healthcare
providers. Hospitals including St. Lawrence Health
System (USA), Sonoma Valley Hospital (USA), and
Sky Lakes Medical Center (USA), all reported that
they were impacted by ransomware attacks in 2020.
On 20 May 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(“FBI”) identified at least 16 Conti ransomware
attacks targeting US healthcare11. Healthcare
organisations that have been the target of similar
attacks this year include, Waikato District Health
Board, New Zealand (May 2021), Eskenazi Health,
USA (August 2021), Memorial Health System, USA
(August 2021) and Macquarie Health Corporation,
Australia (October 2021). More recently, much of the
provincial healthcare system in Newfoundland was
impacted by a cyber attack (November 2021). The
ransomware attack against the HSE would appear
to be the first occurrence of an entire national health
service being impacted by such an attack.

Timeline of the Incident

Scope of our review
In June 2021, PwC was commissioned by the Board
of the HSE, in conjunction with the Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) and the Executive Management Team
(“EMT”), to conduct an independent post incident
review (“PIR”) to urgently establish the facts in relation
to the HSE’s technical and operational preparedness
for an incident of this nature; and to identify the
learnings from this Incident both for the HSE and
for State and non-State organisations to inform their
future preparedness. We initially undertook a scoping
phase, to develop our understanding of the Incident
and our approach to the review, followed by the PIR
engagement which was conducted over a 14 week
period.

This is a complex PIR. In recognition of this
complexity, we brought together an experienced
multi-disciplinary team of international cybersecurity
and crisis management specialists. Our team
included forensic investigation and response, IT
/ cybersecurity, crisis management, culture and
behaviour, and regulatory experts with extensive
experience in cybersecurity PIRs.

On 18 March 2021, the source of the cyber-attack12
originated from a malicious software (“Malware”)
infection on a HSE workstation (the “Patient Zero
Workstation”). The Malware infection was the result
of the user of the Patient Zero Workstation clicking
and opening a malicious Microsoft Excel file that was
attached to a phishing email sent to the user on 16
March 2021.
After gaining unauthorised access to the HSE’s
IT environment on 18 March 2021, the Attacker
continued to operate in the environment over
an eight week period until the detonation of the
Conti ransomware on 14 May 2021. This included
compromising and abusing a significant number
of accounts with high levels of privileges (typically
required for performing administrative tasks),
compromising a significant number of servers,
exfiltrating data and moving laterally to statutory and
voluntary hospitals.
The Incident was not identified and contained until
after the detonation of the Conti ransomware on 14
May 2021, which caused widespread IT disruption.
There were several detections of the Attacker’s
activity prior to 14 May 2021, but these did not result
in a cybersecurity incident and investigation initiated
by the HSE and as a result opportunities to prevent
the successful detonation of the ransomware were
missed. The key events from 18 March 2021 to 14
May 2021 are set out in the diagram overleaf.

We took a sample approach to review the
involvement of the hospitals and Community
Healthcare Organisations (“CHO”) within the HSE’s

The HSE was assisted by the Defence Forces and
the NCSC as well as third parties in the early weeks
of the Incident, to provide structure to the response
activities. The response teams could not initially focus
on the highest priority response and recovery tasks
due to the lack of preparedness for a widespread
disruptive IT event e.g. through not having a preprepared list of prioritised clinical systems and
applications to focus their efforts.
On 15 May 2021, the HSE senior management set
up a war room at a third party’s office building on
Molesworth Street. On 20 May 2021, the Defence
Forces attended Molesworth Street for further
discussions around the level of support that was
required by the HSE during the response and
recovery phases of the Incident and on 21 May 2021,
the HSE set up a physical situation centre (“SitCen”)
in CityWest to manage the response and recovery.
The HSE engaged a third party Incident Response
organisation (“HSE’s Incident Response provider’’) to
investigate the cyber attack.
On 20 May 2021, the HSE secured a High Court
injunction13 restraining any sharing, processing,
selling or publishing of data stolen from its computer
systems. On the same day, the Attacker posted a
link to a key that would decrypt files encrypted by
the Conti ransomware. The HSE’s Incident Response
provider validated that the decryption key worked
on 21 May 2021 and provided it to the HSE, allowing
them to gain access to the data that had been
encrypted by the Conti ransomware. Without the
decryption key, it is unknown whether systems could
have been recovered fully or how long it would have
taken to recover systems from backups, but it is
highly likely that the recovery timeframe would have
been considerably longer.
From 22 May 2021 onward, the HSE Information and
Communications Technology (“ICT”) team moved
from the response phase into the recovery phase,
where they focused their efforts on decrypting
systems, cleansing workstations, restoring
systems and the recovery of applications. The HSE
recovered their primary identity systems (
Active Directory (“AD”) domain) within days of the
Incident, but decryption of servers and acute and
community services applications took place largely
over the following three months. By 21 September
2021, the HSE had recovered all servers and 1,075
applications, out of a total of 1,087 applications14.
At the time of issuing this report, the HSE had notified
the Data Protection Commissioner (“DPC”) in relation
to the Incident, however, they have not made any
13
14
15

data subject notifications for personal data exposure
or exfiltration. The HSE’s Legal and Data workstream
continues to work closely with the DPC in relation to
this matter.

Mitigating factors impacting on the
Incident
There were a number of mitigating factors which had
a considerable effect in reducing the severity and
impact of the Incident.
Relative simplicity of the attack and the release of
the decryption key
Based on the forensic examination of the Attacker’s
activity, it would appear that the Attacker used
relatively well-known techniques and software to
execute their attack. A more sophisticated attack
may have involved gathering intelligence in advance,
before it could be successfully and subtly exploited.
The impact of the Incident on the HSE and health
services could have been significantly greater, with far
more severe clinical impact. Some examples of this
include, but are not limited to:
•

if there had been intent by the Attacker to target
specific devices within the HSE environment (e.g.
medical devices);

•

if the ransomware took actions to destroy data at
scale;

•

if the ransomware had auto-propagation and
persistence capabilities, for example by using
an exploit to propagate across domains and
trust-boundaries to medical devices (e.g. the
EternalBlue exploit used by the WannaCry and
NotPetya15 attacks);

•

if cloud systems had also been encrypted such as
the COVID-19 vaccination system.

An additional mitigating factor was the release of the
decryption key by the Attackers on 20 May 2021,
which allowed for an accelerated recovery process.
It is unclear how much data would have been
unrecoverable if a decryption key had not become
available as the HSE’s backup infrastructure was only
periodically backed up to offline tape. Therefore it is
highly likely that segments of data for backup would
have remained encrypted, resulting in significant data
loss. It is also likely to have taken considerably longer
to recover systems without the decryption key.

Significant ‘in-the moment’ efforts in response to
the Incident
A recurring theme observed throughout the PIR was
the dedication and effort observed at all levels during
the response to the Incident. This included individuals
from across the HSE, impacted hospitals, CHOs, and
third parties all going “above and beyond” in their
call of duty. This illustrates that, in times of significant
challenge or emergencies, staff in the health services
are resilient, respond quickly, and have an ability to
implement actions and workarounds to maintain even
a basic continuity of service to their patients.
National support
The impact of the Incident was at a national scale
which encouraged support and presence from other
state agencies and third parties, who provided
structure, governance, technical expertise and
resources to assist the response and recovery.
Lessons learned from COVID-19 and previous IT
disruptions
Whilst the HSE had not previously encountered
an incident of this scale, they have been exposed
to other significant incidents both directly (e.g
COVID-19) and through observations of ransomware
attacks on other healthcare organisations globally
(e.g WannaCry ransomware attack) over the past
five years. Each of these incidents highlighted key
learnings that have led to an improved level of crisis
management maturity within the HSE.

Strategic recommendations and
findings
The Incident demonstrated that the HSE and
organisations connected to the NHN are vulnerable
to common cyber attacks that can cause significant
impact to the provision of health services.
Transformational change is required across the
technology foundation for provision of health services
and its associated cybersecurity, that will need to be
executed over the coming years.
In order to deliver a significant and sustainable
change in the exposure to cybersecurity risk, four
areas of strategic focus are required across the HSE
and other parties connected to the NHN. There are
dependencies across these four areas and they need
to be progressed in parallel. They are summarised
below, with further detail provided in Section 4.1.
More detailed findings and recommendations are
provided in Section 5.

5 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

1.

Implement an enhanced governance structure
over IT and cybersecurity that will provide
appropriate focus, attention and oversight.

1.1 Establish clear responsibilities for IT and
cybersecurity across all parties that connect to
the NHN, share health data or access shared
health services. Establish a ‘code of connection’
that sets minimum cybersecurity requirements
for all parties and develop an assurance
mechanism to ensure adherence.
One of the challenges faced by the HSE is that
cybersecurity risk materialises as a ‘common risk’
to all organisations connected to the NHN given
the interconnected nature of the IT systems. Under
the governance constructs of the health service,
organisations have varying levels of autonomy over
IT and cybersecurity decision making, yet the risk is
shared - with organisations dependent on each other
for cybersecurity. There is no ‘code of connection’
for all parties that connect to the NHN, share health
data or use shared services in order to set a minimum
baseline of security standards.
1.2 Establish an executive level cybersecurity
oversight committee to drive continuous
assessment of cybersecurity risk and a
cybersecurity transformation programme across
the provision of health services.
Within the HSE, there is no dedicated executive
oversight committee that provides direction and
oversight to cybersecurity, both within the HSE and
all organisations connected to the NHN. A known
low level of cybersecurity maturity, including critical
issues with cybersecurity capability, has persisted.
It is important that the cybersecurity oversight
committee includes participation from user groups,
so that culturally cybersecurity moves from being
perceived as an IT challenge, to being perceived
as ‘how we work’. The cybersecurity oversight
committee should be accountable for ensuring
compliance with the evolving requirements of the EU
NISD for essential services across the health service.
1.3 Establish an executive level oversight
committee for IT.
With a fragmented set of decision rights over IT
development and support across the provision of
health services, a necessary enabler for driving
transformational change will be the establishment
of an executive level committee, chaired by the
Chief Technology and Transformation Officer (see
Recommendation 2 below), that can agree the
priorities for IT development and investment, and
align all interested parties behind a clear vision,
strategy and plan. Critical to its success will be the

participation of IT leaders from across the health
service.
1.4 Establish a board committee (or repurpose
an existing one) to oversee the transformation
of IT and cybersecurity to deliver a futurefit, resilient technology base for provision of
digitally-enabled health services, and ensure
that IT and cybersecurity risks remain within
a defined risk appetite. Consider the inclusion
of further specialist non-executive members
of the committee in order to provide additional
expertise and insight to the committee.
Cybersecurity was recorded as a ‘High’ risk in the
Corporate Risk Register in Q1 2019.16 At the time
of the Incident, the risk rating for cybersecurity on
the Corporate Risk Register was 16, based on a
likelihood scoring of 4 (likely, with a 75% probability)
and an impact scoring of ‘Major’.17 The HSE’s risk
assessment tool is described in Appendix H.
Risks on the Register are subject to a quarterly review
process and the quarterly reports are reviewed by
the relevant Board Committee. The Performance
and Delivery Committee of the Board reviewed the
cyber risk with management in September 202018
and this was followed by a revised mitigation
plan. The Committee includes two experienced IT
leaders in large organisations, although they are not
cybersecurity specialists. This revised mitigation plan
had a number of actions due to be completed post
the date of the Incident. The actions completed prior
to the Incident did not materially impact the risk faced
in this area.
The HSE’s IT-related risks had been presented at
Board level on a number of occasions. However,
the gravity of cybersecurity exposure was not fully
articulated to the Board, given the HSE’s level
of vulnerability to a cyber attack, or assessed
against a defined risk appetite. Known issues with
cybersecurity capability have made limited progress
over the course of several years.
Given the scale of change required across the
provision of health services, it is recommended that
a focused committee of the board is established,
with relevant training provided. Consideration
should be given to appointing additional individuals
to that committee with specialist skills to act in a
non-executive capacity and enhance the ability
for the committee to support and oversee the IT
and cybersecurity transformation. A key role for
the committee will be to ensure that HSE requests
for government funding (e.g. to the Department of
16
17
18

Public Expenditure and Reform (“DPER”)) to invest
in addressing IT and cybersecurity issues are clearly
articulated, and the risks associated with lack of
investment are communicated and understood.
2.

Establish a transformational Chief Technology
& Transformation Officer (“CTTO”) and office
to create a vision and architecture for a
resilient and future-fit technology capability;
to lead the delivery of the significant
transformation programme that is required,
and to build the increased function that will
be necessary to execute such a scale of IT
change.

The national health service is operating on a frail IT
estate with an architecture that has evolved rather
than be designed for resilience and security. The NHN
is primarily an unsegmented (or undivided) network,
and can be described as a “flat” network, to make
it easy for staff to access the IT applications they
require. However, this design exposes the HSE to
the risk of cyber attacks from other organisations
connected to the NHN, as well as exposing other
organisations to cyber attacks originating from
the HSE. This network architecture, coupled with
a complex and unmapped set of permissions for
systems administrators to access systems across the
NHN, enabled the Attacker to access a multitude of
systems across many organisations connected to the
NHN and create the large-scale impact that they did.
The parts of the health service that were arguably
best-equipped to maintain clinical services in the face
of prolonged IT outages were those that rely on paper
records for patient services. Whilst this was a positive
feature in managing the Incident, it highlights the
extent to which modernisation is required across the
health service to enable the adoption of digital health
services.
Reducing cybersecurity risk requires both a
transformation in cybersecurity capability (see
recommendation 3) and IT transformation, to
address the issues of a legacy IT estate and build
cybersecurity and resilience into the IT architecture.
2.1 Appoint a permanent CTTO with the
mandate and authority to develop and execute
a multi-year technology transformation, build
an appropriate level of IT resource for an
organisation the scale of the HSE and oversee
the running of technology services.
The HSE has operated since the end of 2018 with
an interim Chief Information Officer with limited

practical mandate, authority and resources to effect
change across all organisations connected to the
NHN. The level of resourcing in critical IT functions
is significantly lower than we would expect for an
organisation of this size.
The CTTO should assume responsibility for all
capabilities that currently sit within the Office of the
Chief Information Officer (“OoCIO”), as well as a
broadened capability to drive rapid transformation.
The CTTO should be a member of the EMT reporting
to the CEO.
2.2 Under the office of the CTTO, develop an IT
strategy to achieve a secure, resilient and futurefit IT architecture, required for the scale of the
HSE organisation.
The HSE has had a plan for the development of IT
that has been used to secure funding for individual
projects. However it has not been tied to a vision,
strategy and architecture that is deliverable over
a period of years and that provides the necessary
level of resilience through investment in enabling IT
architecture and fallback solutions in the event of
core technology failure. Many interviewees expressed
frustration with an apparent approach of investing
in ‘new projects’ or ‘new features’ rather than the
holistic delivery and maintenance of a technology
foundation for health service provision.
In order to deliver the transformation required, a
clear strategy is required that can be used to secure
commitment to execution across all organisations
involved in the provision of health services, and the
significant funding that will be required over many
years.
3.

Appoint a Chief Information Security
Officer (“CISO”) and establish a suitably
resourced and skilled cybersecurity function.
Develop and drive the implementation of a
cybersecurity transformation programme.
The HSE has a very low level of cybersecurity
maturity (Section 5.3 of this report gives an
evaluation of maturity against the industry
standard “NIST CSF” framework). Examples of
the lack of cybersecurity controls in place at the
time of the Incident include:
•

19

The IT environment did not have many of the
cybersecurity controls that are most effective
at detecting and preventing human-operated
ransomware attacks;

•

There was no security monitoring capability
that was able to effectively detect, investigate
and respond to security alerts across HSE’s
IT environment or the wider NHN;

•

There was a lack of effective patching
(updates, bug fixes etc.) across the IT estate
that is connected to the NHN; and

•

Reliance was placed on a single antivirus
product that was not monitored or effectively
maintained with updates across the estate.
For example, the workstation on which the
Attacker gained their initial foothold did not
have antivirus signatures updated for over a
year.

The low level of cybersecurity maturity,
combined with the frailty of the IT estate,
enabled the Attacker in this Incident to achieve
their objectives with relative ease. The Attacker
was able to use well-known and simple attack
techniques to move around the NHN, extract
data and deploy ransomware software over large
parts of the estate, without detection.
3.1 Appoint a CISO and establish a suitably
resourced and skilled cybersecurity function
The HSE does not have a single responsible
owner for cybersecurity at either senior executive
or management level to provide leadership and
direction. This is highly unusual for an organisation
of the HSE’s size and complexity with reliance on
technology for delivering critical operations and
handling large amounts of sensitive data. As a
consequence, there was no senior cybersecurity
specialist able to ensure recognition of the risks
that the organisation faced due to its cybersecurity
posture and the growing threat environment.
The CISO should be at National Director level, a
direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate
access to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure that
cybersecurity risks are understood and considered
in all decision-making. Whilst recruitment of a
permanent CISO may take some time, appointment
of an interim CISO should be considered in the short
term.
The HSE also had only circa 1519 full-time equivalent
(“FTE”) staff in cybersecurity roles, and they did not
possess the expertise and experience to perform the
tasks expected of them.

This comprises eight FTE within the Information Security Framework and Control team (two of which are students), the Security
Operations team of five FTE and the Security, Standard and Policies team of two FTE. Figures are based on interviewee assertion
and/(or) OoCIO Operating Model – 2020 Current State, December 2019.

7 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

A critical requirement for the HSE to begin to develop
the ability to prevent and detect a similar incident in
the future is the appointment of senior cybersecurity
leadership and the development of a suitably skilled
and resourced cybersecurity function. These skilled
resources are currently scarce and the HSE may need
to consider co-sourcing arrangements to support
resource requirements in this area.

The HSE should establish an Operational Resilience
Policy and Steering Committee to drive integration
between resilience-related disciplines across the
organisation, such as incident management, crisis
management, clinical and services continuity and
enterprise risk management plus disciplines that
can impact on resilience such as cybersecurity and
physical security.

3.2 Develop and drive the execution of a multiyear cybersecurity transformation programme
to deliver an acceptable level of cybersecurity
capability for a national health service.

4.2 Enhance crisis management capabilities to
encompass events such as wide-impact cyber
attacks or large-scale loss of IT.

A multi-year programme to transform cybersecurity
capability in a holistic way is required to be led by the
CISO, to ensure that the provision of health services
in Ireland, and the data that those health services
handle, becomes less vulnerable to cyber attacks.
This programme will include the formalisation of
cybersecurity training and awareness.
Implement a clinical and services continuity
transformation programme reporting to the
National Director for Governance and Risk,
and enhance crisis management capabilities to
encompass events such as wide-impact cyber
attacks or large-scale loss of IT.
4.1 Implement a clinical and services continuity
transformation programme reporting to
the National Director for Governance and
Risk. Establish an Operational Resilience
Policy and Resilience Steering Committee to
drive integration between resilience-related
disciplines, and an overarching approach to
resilience.
The HSE has recognised that clinical and services
continuity (business continuity) as a risk discipline
has not developed at the pace needed with
executive oversight and focus. A National Director
for Governance and Risk (equivalent to a Chief
Risk Officer) was appointed on 14 June 2021, and
assigned responsibility for establishing a clinical and
services continuity framework, through which risk
management and continuity plans will be reviewed,
maintained and validated. Responsibility for clinical
and service continuity under the HSE’s accountability
structure will remain with operational and functional
managers. A programme and resource is required
to develop the consistency and breadth of planning
across the health service, including establishing clear
requirements for disaster recovery capability to be
implemented by the IT transformation programme,
and the mapping of clinical processes to IT systems
and data.

8 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

The HSE has extensive experience in managing
crises, for example in the critical role it has fulfilled
for the nation in navigating the COVID-19 crisis. This
has resulted in some effective mechanisms for crisis
management not just being designed, but regularly
used.
However, the nature of the crisis resulting from
the ransomware attack was different, and required
elements of capability that have not previously been
required. For example: communicating with all staff
in the health service without internal emails or other
IT collaboration tools; establishing a wide variety
of communication channels and forums to gather
information and feedback to prioritise recovery of
systems, and issuing clear guidance to all parties
impacted by the Incident that was relevant to their
localised situation.
The nature of a ransomware attack, resulting in
effectively total loss of IT, makes it particularly
challenging to manage with a unique set of issues
to be navigated. Investment is required in crisis
management planning, resourcing and tools and
processes in the HSE and associated organisations in
order to be prepared to manage this kind of crisis in
the future.

Tactical recommendations
Given the high risk of exposure at present, below are
tactical recommendations which require immediate
attention to achieve urgent impact and to contribute
to the development and implementation of the
strategic recommendations. These recommendations
are described in more detail in Section 4.2 of
this report. Further detail of key findings and
recommendations are included in Section 5 of this
report.
1.

Response to the Incident
1.1. Complete the ongoing work being performed
by the Legal and Data workstream and
continue to work closely with the Data
Protection Commissioner (DPC).

improvements, managing third-parties that
provide cybersecurity services and leading
the cybersecurity response to cyber
incidents.

1.5.

2.

3.

Continue to reconcile medical data stored
and managed through interim processes
post the ransomware attack and place
centralised governance over these
activities.

Formalise a programme and governance
to respond to tactical recommendations
arising from the Incident Response
investigation and provide assurance over
their implementation.

Security monitoring
2.1.

Ensure that the HSE’s Incident Response

respond to incidents on endpoints (i.e.
laptops, desktops, servers etc.) to provide
protection to the entirety of the NHN.

2.2.

Establish an initial cybersecurity incident
monitoring and response capability to
drive immediate improvement to the ability
to detect and respond to cybersecurity
events.

Ability to respond to a similar incident in the
near future
3.1.

crisis communications including resources.

3.2. Develop a plan for response and
management of an NHN-wide similar
incident taking recent learnings into account.
3.3.

4.

IT environment
4.1.

20

level agreements (“SLAs”) for third party
incident and crisis management response
support, together with processes and
sufficient internal expertise to direct and
manage the third-parties

Implement an upgrade to National
Integrated Medical Imaging System
(“NIMIS”) to allow Windows 10 upgrade,

thereby addressing known vulnerabilities
and support issues associated with current
wide deployment of Windows 7.
4.2.

Formalise existing roles and responsibilities
for IT across the entities accessing the
NHN and establish SLAs for centrallyprovided services, while also ensuring
information security policies align with
those responsibilities.

Next Steps
The seriousness of the deficiencies identified persist
and necessitate transformational change in the HSE
as well as immediate tactical actions. We recommend
that the HSE improve their cybersecurity, IT and
operational resilience governance, leadership and
capability, to allow them to stand up a remediation
programme to address our recommendations.
In 2021, the HSE had a combined revenue and capital
budget of nearly €22 billion, which included an IT
operating budget of €82 million and IT capital budget
of €120 million (including €25 million for Covid-19
capital spend)20. The HSE is currently estimating its
IT operating budget will increase to €140m and its
IT capital budget will increase to €130m in 2022.
Whilst it is outside the scope of the PIR to quantify
the incremental cost to the HSE of implementing the
recommendations set out in this report, it is clear
that it will require a very significant investment on an
immediate and sustained basis.
The HSE will need to develop an investment case
for this remediation programme, as the successful
implementation of the strategic and tactical
recommendations will be dependent on a well
resourced plan, against which funding will need to be
secured and progress tracked. This will be a complex
programme, with interdependencies between our
recommendations, and the programme will also need
to be highly integrated with existing project delivery
and business as usual operations. The investment
case will be complex to develop due to for example:
i) it can be challenging to segregate core IT spend
and cybersecurity investment (e.g. upgrading to
Windows 10 or Individual Health Identifier); ii) costs
to release and backfill service staff i.e. clinical and
operational subject matter experts who are critical to
complex e-health projects, will be a relevant cost of
the remediation programme and this will need to be
incorporated into the investment commitment; and iii)
a significant number of cybersecurity and clinical and
service continuity resources need to be put in place,
to deliver on the execution of the plan.

HSE National Service Plan 2021

The cost of the remediation programme, in addition
to underlying technology and operational resilience
costs, is likely to be a multiple of the HSE’s current
capital and operating expenditure in these areas
over several years. Our recommendations need to
be developed into a prioritised plan, with tactical
recommendations implemented on an accelerated
basis. On the basis of this plan, cost estimates for
year one can be established with a reasonable level
of accuracy. Subsequently, within the first year, high
level cost estimates for years 2-5 can be estimated
(possibly over a longer duration, depending on
interdependencies with other change programmes).

Learnings for other organisations
A number of the vulnerabilities that the ransomware
attack highlighted are not unique to the HSE, and
issues identified in this report will be found in other
organisations. All organisations therefore need to
consider the extent to which they are protected from
a major cyber incident, and be prepared to respond
and recover should they experience such an event.
We have outlined these recommendations in Section
1 of this report.

Conclusion
While reviews of this nature tend to focus on what
went wrong to identify learnings, it is also important
to recognise that the Incident was caused by an
Attacker and the HSE was the victim of a cybercrime.
There was a considerable effort made by personnel,
including IT and operations personnel in HSE centre,
the hospitals and CHOs, and healthcare professionals
in all areas, to respond to the Incident, to recover
from the Incident and to continue to provide patient
care throughout the Incident. If this significant effort
had not been made by these people, the impact of
the Incident on the Irish public healthcare system
would certainly have been much worse.
The HSE is operating on a frail IT estate that has
lacked the investment over many years required to
maintain a secure, resilient, modern IT infrastructure.
It does not possess the required cybersecurity
capabilities to protect the operation of the health
services and the data they process, from the
cyber attacks that all organisations face today. It
does not have sufficient subject matter expertise,
resources or appropriate security tooling to detect,
prevent or respond to a cyber attack of this scale.
There were several missed opportunities to detect
malicious activity, prior to the detonation phase of the
ransomware.

resiliency to be built into the IT architecture and
systems, to foster the confidence required to enable
future migration to more digital provision of health
services.
Emergency and crisis planning at the HSE previously
focused on scenarios such as adverse weather,
pandemic, serious accidents and terrorist action,
which generate a temporary surge in demand for
acute services. The assumption was that all critical
infrastructure and processes would remain available
to support the response. Similar to many other
organisations, the HSE did not conduct contingency
planning for a cyber attack or any other scenario
involving the complete loss of infrastructure,
people, or facilities. Clinical and services continuity
has not been a corporate priority in the HSE until
recently. In order to maximise the learnings from the
response to the Incident, the HSE must expand upon
initiatives already started, and implement a coherent
operational resilience capability, including clinical and
services continuity and crisis management, across
the organisation.
Reducing cybersecurity risk requires both a
transformation in cybersecurity capability and IT
transformation, to address the issues of a legacy
and complex IT estate and build cybersecurity and
resilience into the IT architecture. Whilst this will need
to be executed over a period of several years, there
is an imperative for the HSE to act with urgency to
ensure that the necessary plans, vision, leadership,
committed investment and resourcing are in place
to drive this significant change to build a secure,
resilient and future-fit technology foundation for
provision of national healthcare services. The required
investment commitment is likely to be a multiple of
the HSE’s current expenditure on technology and
operational resilience, but is essential to protect the
HSE against future attacks which are inevitable and
have the potential to be even more damaging.
The HSE, the State and non-State organisations now
have an opportunity to take the key lessons from this
major Incident to build a more robust and resilient
cyber frontier nationally.
The HSE remains vulnerable to cyber attacks similar
to that experienced in the Incident, or cyber attacks
that may have an even greater impact.

The relative disadvantage in this Incident for
organisations who have greater dependency on
technology services, illustrates the critical need for

Learnings
Whilst the purpose of this report is to highlight
recommendations and findings specific to the HSE
to be taken from the Incident, there are a number
of recommendations and key learnings that can be
applied to all organisations.

11 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

As dependency on technology deepens across
society, the impact of destructive cyber attacks
such as ransomware will undoubtedly grow even
further. Investing in cybersecurity needs to be a
priority even for organisations that previously have
not considered cyber attacks as a threat to their
operations. A number of the vulnerabilities that
the ransomware attack highlighted are not unique
to the HSE, and issues identified in this report
will also be found in many other organisations.
All organisations therefore need to consider the
extent to which they are protected from a major
cyber incident, and be prepared to respond and
recover should they experience such an event.
The points below are presented as recommendations
that all organisations should consider in the light
of the experience of the HSE, in order to learn
lessons from this Incident more broadly. They are not
intended to be exhaustive, but act as an instructive
set of learnings to consider in response to this
Incident.

Governance and
cybersecurity leadership
1. Understanding of technology dependency
and governance of technology risk
Boards and executive leadership of organisations
should ensure that they understand the extent to
which their critical operations are dependent on
technology. Governance must ensure that risks
associated with technology are properly understood
and actively managed, including the resiliency of
the organisation to widespread technology failure
or compromise from an attack (which may occur
indirectly through the supply chain). Governance over
technology should ensure that sufficient investment
is focused on: maintenance of robust foundational
technology infrastructure; realising opportunities
from new technology (such as infrastructure and
applications in the cloud) to manage risks in a
new way, and managing risks that arise from new
application of technology.

will address the root-cause issue.

Effective cybersecurity
capability
3. Ransomware-specific assessment
Organisations should perform a cybersecurity
assessment specific to the threat of ransomware,
given the heightened threat posed by ransomware
attacks. This will highlight the extent to which the
organisation’s cybersecurity controls are appropriate
and effective to defend against this threat, and
identify areas that may require urgent investment.
Key examples of cybersecurity controls that
should be assessed include: sufficiency of security
monitoring to detect and contain ransomware
attacks in the early stages, ability to prevent and
detect the compromise of ‘privileged’ (e.g. systems
administrator) accounts, and the robustness of user
authentication.
Several organisations that provide ransomwareresponse services can provide such assessments,
and publicly available frameworks and guidance
are available from organisations such as the
Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
(“CISA”) in the USA.
4. Effective cybersecurity monitoring
and response
Organisations must possess an effective security
monitoring capability that can detect and respond to
the tools and techniques used by human-operated
ransomware groups. This should include deploying
a capable ‘Endpoint Detection & Response’ tool to
detect and prevent malicious activity on workstations
(fed by current cyber threat intelligence) and ensuring
the development of skilled resources and processes
so that security alerts are rapidly triaged, investigated
and responded to.
5. Testing of cybersecurity capability
through simulated attacks

2. Cybersecurity strategy and leadership
Organisations should ensure they have a
cybersecurity strategy that defines the key
cybersecurity risks to the organisation, how those
risks are being mitigated and the resourcing and
investment to execute the strategy. Organisations
should have a single accountable senior leader
responsible for delivering the strategy. An element of
the strategy should be consideration of the cyber risk
posed by legacy IT, how this risk can be mitigated in
the short-term, and how technology modernisation

12 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

Testing of cybersecurity capability through the use
of ethical hackers simulating end-to-end attack
techniques (i.e. ‘red team’ testing) is essential
to provide a threat- based perspective of an
organisation’s vulnerability to ransomware and other
types of attacks. This can be used to rapidly identify
and prioritise key security improvement areas and
ensure that the organisation can effectively detect
common attacker tools, with the necessary people

and processes are in place to investigate and
respond to alerts.

Preparedness to
respond and recover
6. Cybersecurity-specific incident response
and crisis management plans
Organisations should develop and exercise
cybersecurity-specific incident response and crisis
management plans that define how a response
should be led, managed and coordinated. These
should be challenged to ensure they are effective
in a catastrophic ransomware scenario where
all IT platforms, cybersecurity tools and usual
communication channels are unavailable, and
recovery efforts may have to be sustained for weeks
or months.

8. Retained incident and crisis support
Organisations should establish contractual retainers
with key third parties that may be required to support
a crisis response. Third party support that may likely
be required during an incident include: forensic and
technical incident response; crisis response; external
legal counsel, and public relations.
Retainers should include: service level agreements;
specification of third party roles and responsibilities;
reviews of the technical preparedness of the
organisation for incident response (by forensic and
technical incident response providers), and preagreed legal requirements (such as non-disclosure
agreements). These will ensure that partners can
be engaged to support, and be integrated into, a
response immediately and scale to the size of the
response required.

7. Business continuity planning and IT disaster
recovery planning for a ransomware scenario
Organisations should prioritise business continuity
planning and disaster recovery planning that
would ensure provision for continuity of critical
operations and the ability to recover in the face
of a ransomware attack that results in total loss
of IT and associated data.
Business continuity planning should be based on
rigorous ‘Business Impact Analysis’, and ensure that
workarounds are defined for the scenario of total loss
of IT for up to several weeks.
Organisations’ IT disaster recovery plans should be
based on a prioritised list of applications and systems
to recover, should the technology base of the
organisation have to be rebuilt or recovered, informed
by an up-to-date asset register and mapping of
critical operations to technology. Offline backups (or
backups that are verified as inaccessible to attackers
with full control of production IT) must be available for
all critical systems, data and infrastructure, including
core IT infrastructure such as Active Directory (“AD”),
with a well-defined and tested restore procedure that
includes verification of ability to recover all systems
to a common point-in-time.

Introduction and
background

14 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

2.1 Overview of the ransomware
cyber attack
In the early hours of Friday 14 May 2021, the HSE
became aware of a major cyber attack (the “Incident”)
against their IT systems. The Incident was carried
out by the criminal infiltration of these systems using
Conti ransomware.21 As a result of the Incident, the
HSE shut down all IT systems and disconnected
networks causing significant disruption to healthcare
services across the country.
At the time of the Incident, the HSE was over a year
into a complex crisis response to the unprecedented
emergency of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The
national healthcare service was subject to one of the
most serious cyber attacks ever in Ireland, one which
affected almost every part of the critical infrastructure
of the country’s healthcare system. It was reported by
HSE management that 80% of the HSE’s environment
across corporate IT services, hospitals, CHOs and
electronic health records (“EHR”) was encrypted22,
causing a severe and long lasting disruption to
healthcare services.
In the immediate aftermath of the Incident,
many hospitals were forced to cancel outpatient
appointments completely while others were operating
with significant delays and reverted to using pen
and paper to continue recording patient care. Over
half of the hospitals in the country announced
cancellations of at least some of their outpatient
appointments.23 The impact of the Incident on
services varied depending on several factors
including the type of care being offered, the reliance
on software applications to record and manage
patient data, existing IT infrastructures and local IT
support.24 The Incident had a significant impact on
diagnostic services due to loss of NIMIS and also
laboratory systems. There was a significant impact
on radiotherapy services, with cessation of radiation
treatment across the five HSE centres (a Model 3

Hospital (“Hospital B”), a Model 4 Hospital (“Hospital
A”), a Model 4 Hospital (“Hospital N”)’, a Model 4
Hospital (“Hospital H”) and a Maternity Hospital
(“Hospital E”)).25
In the community, primary care staff were unable to
access patient appointment lists or contact details,
patient history, treatment plans, x-ray facilities or
monitoring of instrument sterilisation tracking.26 In
many cases, in order to maintain a level of service,
patients were issued with a contingency Medical
Record Number (“MRN”). Work is ongoing to
reconcile these records with existing patient records
and to update systems for hardcopy data recorded
during the period.

Background
The HSE is responsible for delivering health and
social care services to the population of Ireland,
estimated to be 5.01 million in August 2021.27
Services are provided through a network of
operational services covering both community
delivered care and care provided through the hospital
system as well as the National Ambulance Service. In
2021, the HSE had a combined operating and capital
budget of nearly €22bn28.
Community healthcare services are delivered across
nine geographically organised CHOs while acute
hospital services are delivered across a network of
six Hospital Groups and Children’s Health Ireland
(“CHI”). Within the Hospital Groups, there are
54 acute hospitals. These are made up of public
hospitals directly under the authority of the HSE and
voluntary hospitals who receive state funds through
the HSE. The latter are independently owned and
provide services on behalf of the HSE under Section
38 of the Health Act, 2004. They have their own IT
teams and infrastructure but also utilise the national
IT infrastructure as referred to below.
The HSE employs approximately 130,000 people,
including those directly employed by the HSE29 as
well as those employed by organisations funded by
the HSE. It is the largest employer in the State.

OoCIO and the office of the Chief Clinical Officer.
The Centre also manages the National Testing and
Contract Tracing service as well as the COVID-19
vaccination programme.
The HSE undertook a Corporate Centre Review in
2020, in order to examine how the HSE’s corporate
services (delivered through the National Centre)
are organised to best support operational services,
building on insights gained from responding to the
COVID-19 crisis. There were no recommendations for
major changes to IT or cybersecurity in this review
(outside the change outlined below). However, the
change did create a more centralised governance
and risk function with the appointment of a National
Director for Governance and Risk (equivalent to a
Chief Risk Officer) with responsibility for establishing
Enterprise Resilience and Business Continuity
Frameworks, through which risk management
and business continuity plans will be reviewed,
maintained and validated. Responsibility for clinical
and service continuity under the HSE’s accountability
structure will remain with operational and functional
managers.

These and other initial organisational changes took
effect approximately 1 month post the Incident, on 14
June 2021, including:
•

Healthcare Strategy (to include Strategy and
Research, Change and Innovation, Governance
and Risk and Capital and Estates);

•

Clinical (to include Quality & Patient Safety,
Integrated Care Design and Innovation);

•

Integrated Operations (to include Service
Planning, Patient and Service User Experience,

Community healthcare services

Acute hospital services are delivered across the
network of six acute Hospital Groups and CHI
and provide scheduled care, unscheduled care
(unplanned or emergency care), diagnostic services,
specialist services, cancer services, trauma services,
maternity and children’s services and the National
Ambulance Service. Hospital services are provided
through a mix of HSE funded and directly managed
hospitals and voluntary public hospitals funded
predominantly through State funds.

Community healthcare services include primary
care, social inclusion, older persons’ and palliative
care services, disability and mental health services
for both children and adults. Community healthcare
services are currently delivered across nine
geographically organised CHOs and are provided
through a mix of HSE directly provided services
and indirectly provided services through voluntary
section 38 and 39 service providers, GPs and private
providers.

Background to the HSE IT Infrastructure
In health services, there is an extensive community
who are increasingly dependent on connected and
reliable technological solutions and varying levels of
IT support from the HSE National Centre to deliver
clinical services. This includes the HSE’s national IT
infrastructure that enables patient care and patient
safety as referred to further below.

National Healthcare Network
The HSE utilises a NHN for the connectivity and
delivery of critical national health services. The
management of the NHN is the responsibility of the
OoCIO within HSE National Centre, but it is accessed
by the many organisations within the health services.
Figure 6: National Healthcare Network

The NHN is primarily a ‘flat’ network to make it easier
for staff to access the IT applications they require.
However, this design exposes the HSE to the risk of
cyber attacks from other organisations connected to
the NHN, as well as exposing other organisations to
cyber attacks originating from the HSE - since once
an attacker has a presence on the network they have
‘freedom to roam’.
The HSE has a complex IT environment including a
significant number of legacy systems. At the time of
the Incident just under two thirds of the server estate
were described as modern33, with the remaining
estate deemed end of life and operating on extended

Windows 7 workstations that were deemed end of life
by the vendor.35 The HSE assessed its cybersecurity
maturity rating as low.36 For example they do

The HSE is classified as a critical infrastructure
operator under the EU NISD37, also known as an OES.
The purpose of this classification system is to ensure
there is a common, high level security of network
and information systems for Operators of Essential
Services (“OES”) in each EU member state. The
NCSC produces guidelines to assist OES in meeting
these requirements.38

Impact of the Incident on healthcare
services
Healthcare services across the country were
severely disrupted by the Incident, with real and
immediate consequences for the thousands of
patients who require healthcare services on a daily
basis. In frontline healthcare delivery, patient care
and patient safety is enabled by IT applications,
such as diagnostic systems (primarily laboratory and
radiology systems), electronic health records and
pharmacy systems.39 Some of the main impacts of
the Incident were in the areas of patient identification,
ordering and performing diagnostics, reporting
results, prescribing medication and delays in
providing treatment.40 Whilst there is no evidence of
the Attacker compromising medical devices directly,
there was a loss of information flows in and out of
those devices whilst IT systems were down.
The impact on clinical care processes was evident
immediately and the HSE issued guidance that
directed providers towards emergency, urgent and
time scheduled care only41. Clinical contingency
arrangements were put in place with providers
curtailing services. On the morning of the Incident,
31 of the 54 acute hospitals announced cancellations
of at least some of their services.42 43 Cancellations
varied by hospital and included some outpatient
clinics, diagnostic imaging, radiotherapy, certain
pathology tests and certain elective surgeries.

Emergency care continued.
The disruption impact varied by service provider,
depending on its reliance on IT in provision of its
services and its reliance on the NHN and national
systems in particular. Community based services
tended to have less reliance on IT other than email
as compared to the acute hospitals. The COVID-19
testing centres were able to repurpose Healthmail
to generate appointments. The vaccination program
continued with the online vaccination system taken
offline for a few hours only, although the COVID-19
reporting system was lost for a period of time.44 The
National Ambulance Service was not impacted.
HSE business continuity plans did not envisage
a severe but plausible total IT loss scenario for a
period of weeks. Workarounds were quickly put in
place in many instances, to ensure continuity of
services for as long as possible. Certain hospitals
had a manual approach pre-prepared for particular
processes, whilst others did not and staff needed to
be innovative in their approach.
Impact example: For laboratory tests, healthcare
professionals reverted to handwritten forms, with
staff taking them to the lab to be manually entered
and analysed with a similar process for returning
results. This resulted in an increased likelihood
of delay and risk of error with these manual
processes.
There was no access to patient information systems
such as Integrated Patient Management System
(“iPMS”). This resulted in challenges in identifying
patients, retrieving patient paper files, accessing
contact details, managing DNAs (Did Not Attends),
transferring patients between services and managing
patient waiting lists.

Impact example: A GP received a phone call from
a consultant surgeon questioning the location of
a patient due for surgery, when that patient had
already been operated on.
Impact example: One example hospital had no
way to access their appointment data. Unless
people showed up with their appointment letter
in their hand, they did not know how to process
them.
Where electronic healthcare records were relied upon,
access to these records was no longer available.
For example the four maternity hospitals using the
Maternal & Newborn Clinical Management System
(“MN-CMS”) no longer had access. These hospitals
switched to paper records and charts. Whilst
business continuity plans envisaged an IT outage
on MN-CMS for a short period, for example due to
a system upgrade, a data centre outage or similar
issue, the length of time without MN-CMS access
increased risks to patient care, particularly due to the
lack of access to patient history.
Diagnostic systems such as the shared service for
handling medical imaging, NIMIS and compuscope
system were unavailable.
Impact example: For some oncology patients
in the middle of treatment, the Incident meant
that hospitals didn’t have access to the patient’s
radiotherapy plans and could not safely continue
treatment without new medical imaging. Some
hospitals used adjacent private facilities where
available, to take new medical images to continue
providing radiotherapy treatment to patients.
At the time of the PIR, there is a lack of empirical
data to clearly identify the impact of the Incident on
patient care during this period. This is partially due to
incomplete data in many areas due to a backlog of
manual records, but also the difficulty in separately
identifying the impact of the Incident from other
issues affecting public healthcare services during this
time, such as COVID-19, shortage of consultants and
other capacity issues.
The Incident disrupted public hospitals’ ability to
provide complete waiting list data to the National
Treatment Purchase Fund (“NTPF”), therefore no data
was published for June 2021.45
This extremely difficult operating environment,
caused by the Incident, put additional stress on a
system of healthcare professionals that were already
exhausted by four waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Frustrations were expressed at not being able to
provide care in the normal way. Administration and
45

other staff experienced difficulties dealing with
varying levels of frustration and aggression from
patients and members of the public.46
Impact example: “Staff is (sic) fatigued as they
continue to deal with the pandemic, along with IT
issues and workarounds”. “It has had an impact
on staff – the two serious issues coming one after
the other, we haven’t experienced anything like it
before”.
Impact example: During the response, the CIO,
Head of Occupational Health and the National
Ambulance Service identified a risk of staff
burnout. It was at this point Occupational Health
were requested to attend the war room to
check responders’ health, and staff rotas were
implemented.
The HSE has commissioned a study47 to review the
mitigations and contingencies which were adopted to
minimise the impact of the Incident on patient safety,
with a focus also on what worked well to inform future
planning for IT outages. It is a longitudinal study so
will take into account the longer term impact from
the Incident. We were provided with a draft report of
this study, but the study is ongoing and therefore the
report is incomplete at the date of this PIR report.
This study when completed will provide further insight
into the impact of the Incident on healthcare services.
There were also many non-clinical impacts from
the Incident on the HSE and organisations that are
funded by it. These are varied and wide ranging.
Some examples include:
Impact example: Whilst payments of wages and
salaries to HSE staff generally continued, travel
and subsistence claims could not initially be paid.
Pandemic Placement Grant (“PPG”) for student
nurses and midwives, which was due to be paid
by the 1st June 2021, was delayed in many areas
and in some instances was only partially paid.

Impact example: Inability to use HSE email
accounts led to a delay in the General Register
Office process leading to delays in child benefit
payments for new births or delays in issuing
passports.

2.2
Background to this post
incident review
Under the HSE’s Incident Management Framework,
the Incident has been categorised as a Category
1: Major or Extreme Incident as per the HSE’s Risk
Impact Table48 which requires a Comprehensive
Review. Given the seriousness of the Incident, the
impact it has had on people dependent on health
services and the associated patient safety risks as
well as the heightened vulnerability for the HSE as
a result of the current disruption, it was agreed by
the Board of the HSE (“the Board”) in conjunction
with the CEO and the EMT that this review would be
carried out as an independent PIR.
In June 2021, PwC was commissioned by the
Board in conjunction with the CEO and the EMT to
undertake an immediate and independent PIR into
the circumstances surrounding the infiltration of the
HSE’s IT systems. The PIR was carried out under the
terms as set out in the HSE’s Incident Management
Framework. Following an initial four week scoping
phase, the PIR was conducted over a period of 14
weeks.
The purpose of the PIR was to:
•

•

•

Urgently establish the facts in relation to the
current preparedness of the HSE in terms of
both its technical preparedness (Information and
Communications Technology (“ICT”) systems,
cyber and information protections) and its
operational preparedness (including Business
Continuity Management planning) for a strategic
risk of this nature;
Identify the learnings from this Incident to identify
improvements to the HSE’s preparedness for and
response to other major risks including immediate
risks and incidents that cause major business
disruption; and
Share those learnings within the HSE and
externally with State and non-State organisations
to inform their future preparedness.

2.3

Scope of our review

The scope of the PIR covers the HSE National Centre
and their provision and interaction with the nine
CHOs, the six Hospital Groups and CHI.
We took a sample approach to review the
involvement of the CHOs and the hospitals within
the Hospital Groups, specifically looking at how the
HSE’s strategy was implemented at tactical levels

and the effectiveness of the HSE’s coordination of
efforts. We selected a sample of two CHOs and
nine hospitals,each of which were impacted by the
Incident. This sample included a mix of voluntary
and HSE managed hospitals, a geographical spread
and differences in disruption levels caused by
the Incident. We did not review the technical and
operational preparedness and response of each
individual hospital or CHO.
The review did not cover other agencies such as
TUSLA or third party healthcare service providers.
Our review did not cover the cyber attack at the
Department of Health (“DoH”), though the timing of
this attack is referenced in our review.
The scope of the review did not cover an evaluation
of the appropriateness of the HSE’s current or
historic spend on cybersecurity/ defence or the
appropriateness of its annual IT expenditure generally.
We did not validate the work performed as part of any
previous information security audits or related work
on which the HSE historically made decisions.
A technical forensic investigation was carried out
by the HSE’s Incident Response provider after
the Incident. Though we relied on outputs from
the HSE’s Incident Response provider to inform
our assessment, we did not re-examine the HSE’s
Incident Response provider’s evidence nor did we
re-perform their forensic analysis as part of the
review. Moreover, we limited analysis of technical
security controls to those implemented to address
the specific attack techniques identified to be used
during the Incident.
More details of the scope of our review can be found
in Appendix A.

2.4

Our review approach

Undertaking a review of this nature is complex
and requires a deep understanding of the context
in which the Incident occured, the environment in
which the HSE operates, the structure of public
healthcare services in Ireland and the structure of
the HSE itself. In order to rapidly understand and
analyse the intricacies of the HSE’s preparation and
response for this Incident, we brought together an
experienced team of IT and cybersecurity experts in
both Ireland and the UK as well as specialists in crisis
management, forensic investigation and response,
data privacy, healthcare and regulatory experts with
extensive experience in cybersecurity PIRs.

In recognition of the complexity and multifaceted
nature of the Incident, we approached our review
through the lens of three connected but distinct areas
of focus.

•

Focus area 1

Focus area 2

To review the technical investigation and response

Focus area 2
To review the organisation-wide preparedness and
strategic response

Focus area 3
To review the preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber
risks

Focus area 1
In this area, we reviewed the technical investigation
and response to the Incident and the subsequent
recovery and investigation activities undertaken
by the HSE. We reviewed the effectiveness of
the response and recovery, the sufficiency of the
investigation to support the conclusions made and
the ability of the HSE to detect and prevent similar
incidents in the future.
We took a phase-based approach to this focus
area, looking at preparedness to defend against and
respond to a ransomware cyber attack, response
to the Incident, recovery from the Incident and
sustainable reduction of risk since the Incident.
We used our proprietary “Ransomware Capability
Framework”49 to assess the cybersecurity controls
in place at the time of the Incident. In addition,
we reviewed the HSE’s network and AD structure,
including the architecture of the NHN and conducted
an analysis of the recovery of specific applications.
In each phase, we deep-dived into specific areas of
interest that were identified during our review. This
was done through:
•

review of relevant documentation including
a sample of daily incident Situation Reports
(“SITREP”s), investigation reports, RAID logs and
recovery plans;

•

interviews with key stakeholders involved in the
response, the investigation and the recovery and

49

interviews with technical teams to understand
the cybersecurity controls in place at the time
of the Incident and assess these against our
“Ransomware Capability Framework”.

In this area, we reviewed the organisation-wide
preparedness and the strategic response to the
Incident and the corresponding response and
recovery activities completed by the HSE, including
the subsequent communication and coordination
activities undertaken.
This review was carried out through a three-phased
approach looking at
•

crisis preparedness;

•

crisis response ; and

•

crisis recovery.

It was structured using the International Organisation
for Standardisation (“ISO”) and technical
specifications guiding the implementation and
maintenance of both business continuity and
crisis management capabilities. ISO 22301:2019
“Security and resilience - Business continuity
management systems (BCMS) - requirements guides
the construction, maintenance and validation of an
effective Business Continuity Management System. In
the context of the HSE, the term clinical and services
continuity is used throughout the report, rather
than business continuity. It refers to all acute and
community services, as well as corporate services,
including, but not limited to HR, procurement,
finance, training, ICT etc. PD CEN /TS 17091:2018
is the internationally recognised specification which
provides guidance to strategic decision makers
to plan, implement, establish, operate, monitor,
review, maintain and continually improve a crisis
management capability. The review was done
through;
•

review of relevant documentation relating to the
structure of the HSE, crisis management and
business continuity procedures in place prior to
the Incident,

•

a sample review of SITREPs, morning briefings
and other communication channel conversations
used during the response;

•

interviews with key stakeholders involved in the
organisational response to the Incident;

management structures and processes in
place at the time of the Incident;

–

impacts on operational and clinical services;

–

Our approach in summary
In summary, our review involved:
•

The analysis of more than of 2,500 artefacts
including documents, records and data.

•

A total of 81 interviews with over 190 people from
the National Centre, hospitals, CHOs, GPs as well
as third parties including:

Focus area 3
In this area, we performed an assessment of
the HSE’s cyber preparedness, resilience and
ability to respond to future incidents. To carry
out this assessment, we developed a “PIR
Cybersecurity Framework” which was based on
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework50 and Control
Association Control Objectives for Information and
Related Technologies (“COBIT”). These are both
internationally recognised standards used frequently
by organisations to assess their information security
capabilities and IT governance processes. Our “PIR
Cybersecurity Framework” incorporates NIST’s five
key domains and 23 supporting sub-domains along
with the governance aspects from COBIT. This was
performed through:
•

•

review of relevant documentation relating to
the HSE’s information security controls and
processes to measure their effectiveness and
maturity in terms of NIST CSF;
review of relevant documentation to assess
the resilience of the HSE’s information security
controls and processes with a focus on people
and business continuity management using
COBIT as a reference;

•

interviews with key stakeholders involved in
information security and IT governance.

On 14 May 2021, the HSE was subjected to a
significant cyber attack, through the criminal
infiltration of its IT systems using Conti ransomware
software. The Incident impacted all nine domains
within the NHN, which included statutory and
voluntary hospitals and CHOs across the country. A
detailed timeline is included in Appendix E and F.
As part of the response, the HSE engaged the HSE’s

Incident Response provider to undertake a forensic
investigation to establish an understanding of what
the Attacker did while present on HSE systems prior
to the Incident. Evidence was identified as to how the
Attacker was able to gain unauthorised access to the
HSE’s IT environment and what the Attacker did once
they were able to gain this access. The key events
identified during this investigation are set out in the

Timeline prior to the Incident
This section provides a timeline of what the Attacker
did while present on HSE systems prior to the
execution of the Conti ransomware, including the
actions taken by the HSE in response to antivirus
detections.
On 18 March 2021, a HSE staff member interacted
with a malicious Microsoft Office Excel file attached
to a phishing email. This resulted in a Malware
infection of the Patient Zero Workstation.
On 23 March 2021, the Attacker created a
persistence mechanism on the Patient Zero
Workstation to ensure the Attacker retained access to
the HSE’s environment if the Patient Zero Workstation
was rebooted or powered off.
On 31 March 2021, the HSE’s antivirus software
detected the execution of two software tools
commonly used by ransomware groups: Cobalt Strike
and Mimikatz, on the Patient Zero Workstation. The
antivirus software was set to monitor mode so it did
not block the malicious commands.
The HSE’s Incident Response provider identified no
significant Attacker activity between 1 April 2021 and
6 May 2021.
On 7 May 2021, the Attacker installed additional
persistent Malware on the Patient Zero Workstation,
conducted AD and domain reconnaissance, and
compromised further systems within the HSE. The
Attacker was identified as using highly privileged
accounts for the first time.
On 8 May 2021, first identified evidence of the
Attacker compromising systems within Hospital K
and Hospital D.
On 9 May 2021, first identified evidence of the
Attacker compromising a system within Hospital J.
29 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

On 10 May 2021, first identified evidence of the
Attacker compromising systems within Hospital
C and Hospital L. Hospital C’s antivirus software
detected Cobalt Strike on two systems but failed to
quarantine the malicious files.
On 11 May 2021, first identified evidence of the
Attacker compromising a system within Hospital A.
After numerous failed logon attempts, the Attacker
likely exploited an unpatched known vulnerability,
, to gain access to the domain. Hospital
A’s antivirus software detected and deleted the
malware on several systems.
On 12 May 2021, first identified evidence of the
Attacker compromising a system within Hospital B.
The Attacker was identified browsing folders, opening
files, creating archives and accessing or attempting
to access file sharing websites on systems within
Hospital A, Hospital B and Hospital D. The HSE’s
cybersecurity solutions provider emailed the HSE’s
Security Operations team to escalate alerts on two
servers and requested a full on demand scan be
completed.51 The HSE responded on the same day to
confirm the scans had been executed.52
On 13 May 2021, first identified evidence of the
Attacker browsing folders, opening files, creating
archives and accessing a file sharing website on
systems within the HSE. The HSE’s cybersecurity
solutions provider emailed the HSE’s Security
Operations team and outlined that there were
unhandled threat events since 7 May 2021 on at
least 16 systems; the HSE Security Operations team
requested that the Server team restart servers.
On 14 May 2021, the Attacker executed ransomware
on systems within the HSE, Hospital C, Hospital K,
Hospital D, Hospital L, Hospital J and Hospital B.

Timeline prior to the Incident and the
response at Hospital A, Hospital C
and the DoH
Two voluntary hospitals, Hospital A and Hospital C,
identified suspicious activity prior to the Incident.
In addition, the DoH, a third party to the HSE’s
environment, successfully acted on a detection of the
Attacker which prevented the execution of the Conti
ransomware across the vast majority of the DoH.53

The following timeline describes the key activities at
Hospital A, Hospital C and the DoH prior to the Incident.
On 10 May 2021, Hospital C asked Hospital C’s
cybersecurity solutions provider whether they should
be concerned about Cobalt Strike alerts. They were
advised by Hospital C’s cybersecurity solutions
provider that since the threat had been remediated
by their antivirus software, their risk was low.54
Hospital C did not initiate a cyber incident response
investigation.
On 12 May 2021, Hospital A engaged Hospital A’s
Incident Response provider to investigate alerts of
malicious activity. They reset passwords for 4,500
accounts55 and made firewall configuration changes56
to contain the activity, and made contact with the
HSE to request information on two IP addresses.57
To further contain the activity, Hospital A utilised their
existing security tooling across their environment.
On 13 May 2021, the HSE identified the IP addresses
reported by Hospital A related to two servers within
domain. The HSE conducted an
the HSE’s
investigation into the activity identified by Hospital A
and incorrectly concluded in an email between the
HSE teams58 that the suspicious activity originated
from Hospital A, rather than the other way round.
On 13 May 2021, DoH’s cybersecurity solutions
provider59 alerted the DoH to a potential attack on
their network. DoH contacted the NCSC and engaged
DoH’s IR Provider60 who installed endpoint detection
and response (“EDR”) security tooling on the majority
of their systems. These actions blocked the execution
of the Conti ransomware across the vast majority of
the DoH’s infrastructure, including critical and data
servers.

Timeline of the Incident and the
response at the HSE on 14 May
The following timeline describes the key activities at
the HSE on the day of the Incident, 14 May 2021.
On 14 May 2021 at approximately 01:00, the Attacker
executed ransomware on systems within the HSE,
Hospital C, Hospital K, Hospital D, Hospital L,
Hospital J and Hospital B.

At 02:50, the HSE’s national service desk received
the first of multiple reports from hospitals of
multiple systems being unavailable as a result of the
Incident.61
At 04:36, the HSE identified malicious encryption on
multiple servers in the HSE’s data centre.62
At 04:41, due to the widespread reports of
encryption, and the presence of ransomware in the
HSE’s data centre, the HSE invoked their Critical
Incident Process.
At 05:10, an initial critical incident call was held
between network and infrastructure subject matter
experts (“SMEs”). Decisions were taken to contain
the threat including removing all internal and external
connectivity for the NHN, and to begin engagement
with voluntary hospitals.
At approximately 06:00, the CEO notified the Board of
the Incident.
At 07:00, RTÉ News released a news bulletin on
the Incident. Shortly afterwards, the CEO notified
the EMT and National Crisis Management Team
(“NCMT”).
At 07:28, HSE Live, the HSE contact centre, issued
a tweet notifying the public of an incident and the
shutdown of services. Shortly afterwards, the HSE’s
Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) rang the office of the
DPC.
At 08:30, the first meeting of the NCMT was held.63
At 09:22, The HSE informed Primary Care
Reimbursement Service (“PCRS”) of the cyber
incident and PCRS decided to shut down their
systems.
At 10:00, it was reported during a Major Incident
(“MI”) call that the HSE had initiated a preventative
lockdown strategy to contain the impact of the attack
by switching off all systems within the HSE. The
Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, Interpol and the
NCSC were brought in to support the response.
At 10:30, with the support of the NCSC, the HSE
engaged the HSE’s Incident Response provider to
provide incident response services for the HSE. The
HSE also engaged others such as Third Party C,
Third Party A, Third Party D, Third Party B and Third

and voluntary and statutory hospitals.
At 16:30, it was reported that the HSE’s Incident
Response provider began deployment of their
endpoint security monitoring software to gain visibility
of the HSE’s environment and enable a full forensic
investigation of systems within the HSE. The MI
meeting established a once daily operating rhythm.

The following timeline describes the key activities
post the Incident from a response and recovery
perspective at the HSE.
Response
On 15 May 2021, the HSE senior management set
up a war room at a third party’s office building on
Molesworth Street.65 Initial workstreams were set up to
enable a coordinated response and recovery from the
Incident. The HSE’s DPO issued a formal notification
to66 the DPC about the Incident and the HSE’s
Incident Response provider was engaged by voluntary
hospitals to provide incident response support and
questionnaires were sent to the voluntary hospitals
to get an understanding of which entities were
compromised. The HSE’s senior leadership team were
mailboxes
provided with clean Microsoft
to allow for communication during the initial stages of
the response, and a mailbox67 was set up to deal with
issues relating to the ransomware attack.
From 17 May 2021, the HSE coordinated daily
incident management meetings between all parties
supporting the response to the Incident to ensure that
there was a forum to collect and share information.
The OoCIO’s Communications team also established
a twice daily meeting rhythm. These forums were
used to share information about the response and
to communicate new processes to the rest of the
business, in an effort to move to a recovery phase,

It was also within this timeframe that the CIO, Head
of Occupational Health and the National Ambulance
Service identified a risk of staff burnout. It was at this
point, Occupational Health were requested to attend
the war room to check responders’ health, and staff
rotas were implemented.69
From 19 May 2021, key response activities included,
but were not limited to:
•

The first clean laptops were distributed to a select
number of HSE staff members and HSE staff
members were given derogation to use personal
emails and devices for crisis communications;

•

The initial list of priority applications was
reprioritised and informed by clinical priorities, as
dictated by the clinical and integrated governance
structure that was initially set up to guide the
operational response and in an effort to enable a
two way flow of information; and

•

The HSE established a Legal and Data
workstream to oversee the appointment and
subsequent work of their legal advisers and to
support the work of the DPO in coordinating the
HSE’s data protection investigation, engagement
with An Garda Síochána and subsequent
reporting to the DPC.70

Five days into the response, the lack of integrated
programme management was recognised as a risk by

the HSE. This led to a request for assistance from the
Defence Forces who established defined Information
Management processes which were scalable and
agile and could cope with the complexity of a
cyber crisis.
On 20 May 2021, the Defence Forces attended
Molesworth Street for further discussions around the
level of support that was required by the HSE during
the response and recovery phases of the Incident.
It was reported that on the same day, the Attacker
posted a link to a software application that would
decrypt files encrypted by the Conti ransomware
during the Incident. The HSE’s Incident Response
provider, on behalf of the HSE, validated that the
decryption software worked, reverse engineered
its capabilities, and produced a new, more stable
decryption software that was also supported
by them.71 The HSE also secured a High Court
injunction72 restraining any sharing, processing,
selling or publishing of data stolen from its computer
systems.
On 21 May 2021, the SCA recognised the enormous
impact the Incident had on doctors, nurses, midwives
and allied healthcare professionals, on the provision
of health and social care services and clinical care
within the HSE.73 As these professionals were obliged
to practice without the usual back up of essential
systems, clinical imaging and other diagnostic-related
results to assist in their assessment and treatment
of patients, the SCA confirmed these professionals
were fully covered by the Clinical Indemnity Scheme
in relation to their ongoing clinical decision-making, in
the absence of such clinical support. Separately, the
physical SitCen was also established in CityWest.74
On the same day, the availability of the decryption
key allowed the HSE to create efficiencies during the
recovery process by deploying a decryptor across the
environment to decrypt files on impacted systems.
This enabled HSE to scale their recovery effort and
make the overall process
more efficient.

cleansing workstations, restoring systems and the
recovery of applications.
On 24 May 2021, the HSE’s Incident Response
provider and the HSE released their ‘go-to-green’
processes to internal stakeholders, to ensure the
secure recovery of systems, reduce the risk of further
ransomware attacks, and to provide guidance in
recovering systems. The HSE’s Incident Response
provider and the HSE developed requirements that
every system within the HSE, voluntary hospitals and
CHOs had to meet before being able to rejoin the
network, and for organisations to be reconnected
back to the NHN.

Key
recommendations
and findings
The Incident demonstrated that the HSE and
other organisations connected to the NHN are
vulnerable to common cyber attacks that can cause
significant impact to the provision of health services.
Transformational change is required across the
technology foundation for provision of health services,
and its associated cybersecurity, that will need to
be executed over the coming years. There is an
imperative for the HSE to act with urgency in ensuring
the necessary plans, vision, leadership, resource and
budget are in place to drive this significant change
to build a secure, resilient and future-fit technology
foundation for provision of national healthcare services.

33 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

Section 4.1 summarises from the detailed findings
four strategic areas where transformational change is
required, likely over a period of several years. Further
details that underpin these can be found in Section 5.
Given the high risk exposure at present, we highlight
in Section 4.2 some tactical recommendations
for which immediate attention is required to
achieve urgent impact and to contribute to the
development and implementation of the strategic
recommendations.
Section 5 describes in detail a number of
recommendations to address learnings that the HSE
should take from the Incident, with a supporting key
recommendation mapping in Appendix G.

4.1 Strategic
recommendations
In order to deliver a significant and sustainable
change in the exposure to cybersecurity risk, four
areas of strategic focus are required across the HSE
and other parties connected to the NHN:
•

Governance of IT and cybersecurity;

•

Leadership and transformation of the IT
foundation on which provision of health services
depends;

•

Leadership and transformation of cybersecurity
capability; and

•

Development of clinical and services continuity
and crisis management capability to encompass
‘service-wide’ events such as prolonged total
outage of IT.

There are dependencies across these four areas
and they need to be progressed in parallel. They are
described in the strategic recommendations below,
with further supporting recommendations provided
in Section 5 of this report.

34 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

1. Implement an enhanced governance
structure over IT and cybersecurity
that will provide appropriate focus,
attention and oversight.
1.1 Establish clear responsibilities for IT and
cybersecurity across all parties that connect to
the NHN, share health data or access shared
health services. Establish a ‘code of connection’
that sets minimum cybersecurity requirements
for all parties and develop an assurance
mechanism to ensure adherence.
One of the challenges faced by the HSE is that
cybersecurity risk materialises as a ‘common risk’
to all organisations connected to the NHN given
the interconnected nature of the IT systems. This
has resulted from the direction of digital healthcare
demanding greater interconnectivity, ability to share
information and access to common services. Under
the governance constructs of the health service,
organisations have varying levels of autonomy over
IT and cybersecurity decision making, yet the risk is
shared - with organisations dependent on each other
for cybersecurity. There is no ‘code of connection’
for all parties that connect to the NHN, share
health data or use shared services in order to set a
minimum baseline of security standards. The HSE’s
IT Security Policy was written in 2013, with the last
update in 2014, and does not reflect the controls and
capabilities required to manage cyber risk in 2021.
In order to manage the ‘common risks’ effectively,
clarity is required over responsibilities and decision
rights of all parties. In addition, the HSE must be able
to set minimum standards for IT and cybersecurity,
and ensure compliance to those standards by all
organisations connected to the NHN. These minimum
standards are required in order to ensure there is
confidence in all organisations connected to the
NHN that they are not themselves exposed due to
inadequate cybersecurity controls in an organisation
that they are connected to.

1.2 Establish an executive level cybersecurity
oversight committee to drive continuous
assessment of cybersecurity risk and a
cybersecurity transformation programme across
the provision of health services.

of autonomy over IT decisions remains. It will also be
crucial in directing the evolution of an IT infrastructure
and service provision that aligns with the objectives
of Sláintecare, and establishment of appropriate
levels of resourcing.

The HSE has initiated a number of tactical
improvements post the Incident to better secure
systems as they have been recovered. However,
this will not lead to the level of cyber risk reduction
required to significantly and sustainably reduce the
risk of further ransomware (or other) attacks.

1.4 Establish a board committee (or repurpose
an existing one) to oversee the transformation
of IT and cybersecurity to deliver a futurefit, resilient technology base for provision of
digitally-enabled health services, and ensure
that IT and cybersecurity risks remain within
a defined risk appetite. Consider the inclusion
of further specialist non-executive members
of the committee in order to provide additional
expertise and insight to the committee.

Within the HSE, there is no dedicated executive
oversight committee that provides direction and
oversight to cybersecurity, both within the HSE and
all organisations connected to the NHN. A known
low level of cyber security maturity, including critical
issues with cybersecurity capability, has persisted
for years with little progress. An Information Security
Project Board ceased operating in 2013.
A challenge faced in ensuring cybersecurity of
health systems is balancing the need for ease-ofuse, especially for clinical staff, with cybersecurity
imperatives. For example, implementation of
increased levels of cybersecurity controls such as
‘Multi Factor Authentication’ will have an impact on
working procedures. It is therefore important that
the cybersecurity oversight committee includes
participation from user groups, so that culturally
cybersecurity moves from being perceived as an IT
challenge, to being perceived as ‘how we work’.
Finally, the cybersecurity oversight committee should
be accountable for ensuring compliance with the
evolving requirements of the EU NISD for essential
services across the health service.
1.3 Establish an executive level oversight
committee for IT.
With a fragmented set of decision rights over IT
development and support across the provision of
health services, a necessary enabler for driving
transformational change will be the establishment
of an executive level committee that can agree the
priorities for IT development and investment, and
align all interested parties behind a clear vision,
strategy and plan.
This committee should be chaired by the Chief
Technology & Transformation Officer (see
Recommendation 2 below) and drive reporting on
all aspects of IT hygiene (such as status of legacy
systems) as well as progress in implementation
of strategy. Critical to its success will be the
participation of IT leaders from across the health
service, in particular hospital groups, where a degree

35 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

Cybersecurity was recorded as a ‘High’ risk in the
Corporate Risk Register in Q1 2019.80 At the time
of the Incident, the risk rating for cybersecurity on
the Corporate Risk Register was 16, based on a
likelihood scoring of 4 (likely, with a 75% probability)
and an impact scoring of ‘Major’.81 The HSE’s risk
assessment tool is described in Appendix H.
Risks on the Register are subject to a quarterly review
process and the quarterly reports are reviewed by
the relevant Board Committee. The Performance
and Delivery Committee of the Board reviewed the
cyber risk with management in September 202082
and this was followed by a revised mitigation
plan. The Committee includes two experienced IT
leaders in large organisations, although they are not
cybersecurity specialists. This revised mitigation plan
had a number of actions due to be completed post
the date of the Incident. The actions completed prior
to the Incident did not materially impact the risk faced
in this area.
The HSE’s IT-related risks had been presented at
Board level on a number of occasions. However,
the gravity of cybersecurity exposure was not fully
articulated to the Board, given the HSE’s level
of vulnerability to a cyber attack, or assessed
against a defined risk appetite. Known issues with
cybersecurity capability have made limited progress
over the course of several years.
Other organisations with a critical cybersecurity
exposure, and a need to drive significant technology
transformation have found a dedicated committee of
the board beneficial in order to raise the priority and
focus to an appropriate level and ensure risks are
appropriately communicated and understood.

Given the scale of change required across the
provision of health services, it is recommended that
a focused committee of the board is established,
with relevant training provided. Consideration
should be given to appointing additional individuals
to that committee with specialist skills to act in a
non-executive capacity and enhance the ability
for the committee to support and oversee the IT
and cybersecurity transformation. A key role for
the committee will be to ensure that HSE requests
for government funding (e.g. to DPER) to invest in
addressing IT and cybersecurity issues are clearly
articulated, and the risks associated with lack of
investment are communicated and understood.

2. Establish a transformational Chief
Technology & Transformation Officer
(CTTO) and office to create a vision
and architecture for a resilient and
future-fit technology capability; to
lead the delivery of the significant
transformation programme that is
required, and to build the increased
function that will be necessary to
execute such a scale of IT change.
The national health service is operating on a
frail IT estate with an architecture that has
evolved rather than be designed for resilience
and security.
The NHN is primarily an unsegmented (or undivided)
network, and can be described as a “flat” network,
to make it easy for staff to access the IT applications
they require. However, this design exposes the HSE
to the risk of cyber attacks from other organisations
connected to the NHN, as well as exposing other
organisations to cyber attacks originating from the
HSE - since once an attacker has a presence on the
network they have ‘freedom to roam’. This network
architecture, coupled with a complex and unmapped
set of permissions for systems administrators to
access systems across the NHN, enabled the
Attacker to access a multitude of systems across
many organisations connected to the NHN and create
the large-scale impact that they did.
Part of the frailty of the IT estate is an over-reliance
on legacy systems.

The HSE also has
over 30,000 outdated Windows 7 legacy systems
running on workstations. One reason cited for the
continued proliferation of Windows 7 systems is that
a key shared service for handling medical imaging,
36 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

NIMIS, is not supported by the manufacturer to
function on more modern Windows desktops
without being upgraded. The upgrade has not been
rolled out, despite Windows 7 being deemed ‘endof-life’ by Microsoft in January 2020, with many
organisations upgrading to Windows 10 several years
prior to that. Some hospitals have implemented an
unofficial workaround to enable NIMIS to operate on
Windows 10 machines, with potential implications
on the support and warranty arrangements for their
use of the application, and work to minimise the
dependency on Windows 7 is continuing.
The parts of the health service that were arguably
best-equipped to maintain clinical services in the face
of prolonged IT outages were those that rely on paper
records for patient services. Whilst this was a positive
feature in managing the Incident, it highlights the
extent to which modernisation is required across the
health service to enable the adoption of digital health
services. The relative disadvantage in this Incident for
organisations who are more dependent on technology
services illustrates the critical need for resiliency to
be built into the IT architecture and systems to foster
the confidence required to enable future migration to
more digital provision of health services.
Reducing cybersecurity risk requires both a
transformation in cybersecurity capability (see
recommendation 3) and IT transformation, to
address the issues of a legacy IT estate and build
cybersecurity and resilience into the IT architecture.
2.1 Appoint a permanent Chief Technology
& Transformation Officer with the mandate
and authority to develop and execute a
multi-year technology transformation, build
an appropriate level of IT resource for an
organisation the scale of the HSE and oversee
the running of technology services.
The HSE has operated since the end of 2018 with
an interim Chief Information Officer with a limited
practical mandate, authority and resource to effect
change across all organisations connected to the
NHN. The level of resourcing in critical IT functions
is significantly lower than we would expect for an
organisation with the size of IT estate that the HSE
has; the IT organisation consists of approximately
350 FTE, serving a population of over 70,000 enduser devices. This observation has been consistently
made in interviews, both within the HSE and from
external parties who interfaced with them during the
Incident, and was a known issue within HSE prior to
the Attack with an additional 300 FTE approved for
recruitment shortly before the Incident.
The lack of investment in IT resources over a
sustained period of time has clearly limited the ability
of the HSE to drive modernisation and maintain

the IT estate to be resilient and secure. In addition,
the scarce resource in critical IT functions resulted
in significant key-person dependencies during the
Incident management and recovery, which was
undoubtedly a contributing factor to the extended
length of the recovery process.
In interviews with hospitals and other providers,
it was observed that this incident has highlighted
the need to build greater IT resource within many
of those organisations, as well as at HSE centre,
including representation on leadership committees.
The CTTO should develop a resourcing plan for the
whole health service that will be sufficient to deliver a
transformational strategy, and maintain a resilient and
secure IT estate.
The CTTO should assume responsibility for all
capabilities that currently sit within the OoCIO,
as well as a broadened capability to drive rapid
transformation. The CTTO should be a member of the
EMT reporting to the CEO.
The ransomware incident has served to highlight the
extent to which the provision of health services is
dependent on an effective and resilient IT capability.
The opportunity needs to be seized to reflect this
increased understanding of the criticality of IT with
a repositioning of leadership, funding and level of
resource.
2.2 Under the office of the CTTO, develop an IT
strategy to achieve a secure, resilient and futurefit IT architecture, required for the scale of the
HSE organisation.
In order to deliver the transformation required to the
technology foundation of the health service in Ireland,
a clear strategy is required that can be used to secure
commitment to execution across all organisations
involved in the provision of health services, and the
significant funding that will be required over many
years.
The HSE has had a plan for the development of IT
that has been used to secure funding for individual
projects. However it has not been tied to a vision,
strategy and architecture that is deliverable over
a period of years and that provides the necessary
level of resilience through investment in enabling IT
architecture and fallback solutions in the event of
core technology failure. Many interviewees expressed
frustration with an apparent approach of investing
in ‘new projects’ or ‘new features’ rather than the
holistic delivery and maintenance of a technology
foundation for health service provision.
The development of the IT strategy and target
architecture also needs to explicitly address the

37 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

architecture for deployment of medical devices.
Whilst not in scope for this review, it is apparent that
reliance is placed on medical device manufacturers
to specify how they should be deployed within
the overall IT architecture, with no HSE-mandated
approach to ensuring they could not be impacted by
a cyber attack.
A key requirement for the IT transformation plan that
will be critical to the ability to recover from a similar
incident in the future will be clear alignment between
critical clinical services and the IT applications and
infrastructure they depend on. The recovery activities
following the ransomware incident would have
benefited greatly from such a view, and speed of
decision-making and recovery increased.

3. Appoint a Chief Information Security
Officer (CISO) and establish a suitably
resourced and skilled cybersecurity
function. Develop and drive the
implementation of a cybersecurity
transformation programme.
The HSE has a very low level of cybersecurity
maturity (Section 5.3 of this report gives an evaluation
of maturity against the industry standard ‘NIST’
cybersecurity framework). Examples of the lack of
cybersecurity controls in place at the time of the
Incident include:
•

The IT environment did not have many of the
cybersecurity controls that are most effective
at detecting and preventing human-operated
ransomware attacks;

•

There was no security monitoring capability
that was able to effectively detect, investigate
and respond to security alerts across HSE’s IT
environment or the wider NHN;

•

There was a lack of comprehensive effective
patching (updates, bug fixes etc.) across the
IT estate of all organisations connected to the
NHN; and

•

Reliance was placed on a single antivirus product
that was not monitored or effectively maintained
with updates across the estate. For example, the
workstation on which the Attacker gained their
initial foothold did not have antivirus signatures
updated for over a year.

The low level of cybersecurity maturity, combined
with the frailty of the IT estate, enabled the Attacker
in this incident to achieve their objectives with relative
ease. The Attacker was able to use well-known and
simple attack techniques to move around the NHN,

© 2021 PwC. All rights reserved.

extract data and deploy ransomware software over
large parts of the estate, without detection.
3.1 Appoint a CISO and establish a suitably
resourced and skilled cybersecurity function.
The HSE has not had a single responsible owner
for cybersecurity at either senior executive or
management level, responsible for cybersecurity
leadership and direction. This is highly unusual for
an organisation of the HSE’s size and complexity
with reliance on technology for delivering critical
operations and handling large amounts of sensitive
data. As a consequence, there was no senior
cybersecurity specialist able to ensure recognition
of the risks that the organisation faced due to
its cybersecurity posture and the growing threat
environment.
The HSE lacked a detailed and holistic cybersecurity
strategy, operating model and transformation plan
that outlined the strategic, tactical and operational
activities required to mitigate known weaknesses and
reduce cyber risk exposure.
The CISO should be at National Director level, a
direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate
access to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure that
cybersecurity risks are understood and considered in
all decision-making. They should be responsible for
cybersecurity operations as well as driving strategic
and tactical actions to transform cybersecurity
capability, and providing updates to the Board. Whilst
recruitment of a permanent CISO may take some
time, appointment of an interim CISO should be
considered in the short term.
The HSE also only had circa 15 FTE in cybersecurity
roles, and they did not possess the expertise and
experience to perform the tasks expected of them.
For example, alerts were generated by antivirus
software on key systems in the days leading up to the
attack, which were passed to the cybersecurity team.
However, there was insufficient expertise, and a lack
of expertly-designed triaging processes to appreciate
the significance of the alerts and take appropriately
urgent action to prevent the attack resulting in
significant disruption to systems. As a result,
opportunities to prevent the crisis were missed.
A critical requirement for the HSE to begin to develop
the ability to prevent and detect a similar incident in
the future is the appointment of senior cybersecurity
leadership and the development of a suitably skilled
and resourced cybersecurity function. These skilled
resources are currently scarce and the HSE may need
to consider co-sourcing arrangements to support
requirements in this area.

38 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

3.2 Develop and drive the execution of a multiyear cybersecurity transformation programme
to deliver an acceptable level of cybersecurity
capability for a national health service.
It is apparent that significant capability and controls
need to be built and implemented across HSE and
other organisations involved in the provision of health
services, in order to achieve even a basic level of
protection against cyber attacks. This will need
to dovetail with the transformation of IT, but also
extend beyond IT into ‘the way people work’ (see
recommendation 1.2 above).
There will therefore need to be a multi-year
programme to transform cybersecurity capability in
a holistic way to ensure that the provision of health
services in Ireland, and the data that those health
services handle, becomes less vulnerable to cyber
attacks. Further detail as to a suggested structure of
the programme is given in Section 5.

4. Implement a clinical and services
continuity transformation programme
reporting to the National Director for
Governance and Risk and enhance
crisis management capabilities to
encompass events such as wide-impact
cyber attacks or large-scale loss of IT.
4.1 Implement a clinical and services continuity
transformation programme reporting to the
National Director for Governance and Risk.
Establish an Operational Resilience Policy
and Resilience Steering Committee to drive
integration between resilience-related disciplines,
and an overarching approach to resilience.
The HSE and associated organisations such as
hospitals, CHOs, and GPs have dealt with a number
of crises over recent years that have required
development of clinical and services continuity plans
and the ‘muscle memory’ that comes from repeatedly
managing incidents. Indeed one voluntary hospital
described the short-term outage of certain local IT
systems as a regular occurrence that their BusinessAs-Usual processes were designed to accommodate.
It is apparent that much of the planning for clinical
and services continuity (a more appropriate name for
the ‘business continuity’ discipline in the HSE) has
occurred at local level, for specific organisations,
and there has not been a programme to ensure
consistency of clinical and services continuity
planning across all health service organisations
and the HSE centre itself, and cross-sharing of
leading thinking.

© 2021 PwC. All rights reserved.

In addition, as is the case with many other
organisations, the scenario of sustained loss of IT
across the entire health service has not been planned
for, with specific considerations and playbooks. As
a result, both within organisations and at the HSE
centre, great efforts were required ‘in the moment’
to manage the impacts of the ransomware attack
on clinical services, implement workarounds and
manage patient risk. The success of these efforts was
significantly due to the personal commitment, energy
and ingenuity of individuals across all organisations,
with no plans or playbooks for such an event that
could be relied upon.
A particular challenge faced during the recovery
process was the identification and prioritisation of
critical systems for recovery. Processes were rapidly
developed during the days and weeks following the
Incident, to identify the most critical health services
for recovery and to map them back to IT systems
and infrastructure. However, the understanding and
map of the dependencies between specific clinical
services and IT systems had not been developed
prior to the Incident. Development of this dependency
map is a critical requirement for clinical and services
continuity planning for future similar events.
During the recovery process in the days following
the ransomware attack it became apparent that
disaster recovery (DR) arrangements for IT systems
were ad hoc and inconsistent. With the Attacker
able to corrupt some primary data stores for disaster
recovery, there was a requirement to identify
secondary stores and attempt to recover from them.
A workstream was initiated to attempt to locate them
and test the viability of recovery. Were systems to
have been recovered using this method, they would
have been recovered to different points in time
that backups were available for, and there was no
confidence in the completeness (or in some cases
tested viability) of recovery solutions. As a result,
when the decryption key became available from
the Attacker, the decision was made to abandon
work to recover from backups, and instead recover
systems from their production environment, using
the decryption capability provided by the Attacker. It
cannot be confidently asserted that all health services
would have been able to recover in a timely manner
(or even at all) without the provision of the decryption
key by the Attacker.
The HSE has recognised that clinical and services
continuity as a risk discipline has not developed
at the pace needed with executive oversight
and focus. A National Director for Governance
and Risk (equivalent to a Chief Risk Officer) has
been appointed, and assigned responsibility for
establishing a clinical and services continuity
framework, through which risk management and
continuity plans will be reviewed, maintained and

39 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

validated. Responsibility for clinical and service
continuity under the HSE’s accountability structure
will remain with operational and functional managers.
A programme and resource is required to develop
the consistency and breadth of planning across
the health service, including establishing clear
requirements for disaster recovery capability to be
implemented by the IT transformation programme,
and the mapping of clinical processes to IT systems
and data.
In addition, the HSE should establish an Operational
Resilience Policy and Steering Committee to
drive integration between resilience-related
disciplines across the organisation, such as incident
management, crisis management, clinical and
services continuity and enterprise risk management
plus disciplines that can impact on resilience such as
cybersecurity and physical security.
4.2 Enhance crisis management capabilities to
encompass events such as wide-impact cyber
attacks or large-scale loss of IT.
It is indisputable that the HSE has extensive
experience in managing crises, for example in the
critical role it has fulfilled for the nation in navigating
the COVID-19 crisis. This has resulted in some
effective mechanisms for crisis management not
just being designed, but regularly used. In addition,
significant effort has been expended in planning for
large-scale external events that the health service
will be required to manage such as a plane crash
or security incident in a city. Mechanisms that have
been developed from previous crises served well
in managing this crisis - of particular note was the
effectiveness of communications out to the general
public and media.
However, the nature of the crisis resulting from
the ransomware attack was different, and required
elements of capability that have not previously been
required. For example: communicating with all staff
in the health service without internal emails or other
IT collaboration tools; establishing a wide variety
of communication channels and forums to gather
information and feedback to prioritise recovery of
systems, and issuing clear guidance to all parties
impacted by the Incident that was relevant to their
localised situation. Even establishing a coherent set
of facts from which to build communications to the
public proved to be challenging, as is typical in
a ransomware recovery situation.
The establishment of a crisis management centre
and working group, initially in a third party
organisation’s offices and subsequently in City West,
were examples of crisis management structures that
had to be developed ‘in-the-moment’ rather than

© 2021 PwC. All rights reserved.

being pre-planned. Support from the Defence Forces
and other parties enabled an effective structure and
set of information flows to be developed rapidly, but
this evolved over several days and critical time was
lost in the recovery process as a result.
The nature of a ransomware attack, resulting in
effectively total loss of IT, makes it particularly
challenging to manage with a unique set of issues
to be navigated. Investment is required in crisis
management planning, resourcing tools and
processes in the HSE and associated organisations
in order to be prepared to manage this kind of
crisis in the future.

4.2 Immediate tactical
actions
As highlighted above, there is a requirement
for a transformational body of work over
several years to make strategic changes to
the governance, leadership and capability
across IT, cybersecurity, clinical and services
continuity and crisis management. Given the
high risk exposure at present, we highlight in
this section some tactical recommendations
for which immediate attention is required to
achieve urgent impact and to contribute to the
development and implementation of the strategic
recommendations. Further information on these,
and other recommendations, is given in Section 5.

1. Response to the Incident
1.1 Complete the ongoing work being performed
by the Legal and Data workstream and continue
to work closely with the Data Protection
Commissioner (DPC).
The HSE established a Legal and Data workstream
to support the work of their Data Protection Officer
(DPO) in coordinating the HSE’s data protection
investigation, engagement with An Garda Síochána,
and subsequent reporting to the DPC.
Through forensic analysis of systems, and review
of data sets, this workstream will need, to the
extent possible, undertake the following actions:

•

Determine the course of action to be taken, such
as, informing data subjects and referring identified
potential data breaches to other organisations.

The DPO should continue to work closely and
maintain regular dialogue with the DPC until the
conclusion of the HSE’s data protection investigation
(see key recommendation FA2.KR20 in section 5.2).
1.2 Continue to reconcile medical data stored
and managed through interim processes post
the ransomware attack and place centralised
governance over these activities.
As the HSE has moved out of the ‘crisis phase’ of
responding to the ransomware attack, it should put
in place sustainable governance to manage and
resolve the risks and issues originating from the
Incident to HSE’s data (see FA2. KR22.2 in section
5.2).
During the Incident, workarounds were implemented
across the HSE, Hospital Groups/hospitals and CHOs
to allow clinical services to continue operating. This
often resulted in teams reverting back to paperbased records. There are multiple ongoing efforts to
reconcile these paper based records with the data in
recovered clinical applications. Until this is complete
there is a risk
that clinical services are impacted by patients
not having up-to-date medical records in the
appropriate systems.
Members of staff used personal email accounts and
devices for information sharing and communication.
The HSE issued a communication in August 2021 to
stand down the use of personal emails and ensure all
data was deleted from local storage areas. However,
some stakeholders from hospitals and CHOs reported
they have not received clear guidance on the steps
required to address this risk.
The HSE should establish centralised governance
over these activities. This should initiate a review of
the scope of work required to resolve these risks and
issues, provide the necessary resources to prioritise
this work and track it through to completion, across
all HGs/hospitals and CHOs.
1.3 Collate and manage artefacts created
in response to the Incident, including initial
production of an asset register.

•

Assess the likelihood that the attacker took
a copy of data from systems on the NHN;

•

Assess the content of data sets at risk for
personal data;

The HSE should collect, organise and document
artefacts created as part of the response and
recovery to the ransomware cyber attack.

•

Assess whether any potential breaches meet
the threshold to be reported to the DPC;

The HSE was able to gather a significant amount
of information during the response to the Incident,

40 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

© 2021 PwC. All rights reserved.

for example key information about the technology
underpinning the clinical applications that were
being used across the HSE, hospitals and CHOs.
In addition, response processes and plans were
developed that would be invaluable in the event
of a similar attack in future.
These documents will provide a foundation for
developing an up-to-date asset and application
register, as well as plans that will assist in
the response to future incidents (see key
recommendation FA1.KR11 in section 5.1
for further detail).
1.4 Appoint an interim senior leader for
cybersecurity (a CISO) to be responsible
for driving forward tactical cybersecurity
improvements, managing third-parties that
provide cybersecurity services and leading the
cybersecurity response to cyber incidents.
The HSE should appoint an interim senior leader
for cybersecurity (a CISO) who has experience in
rapidly reducing the vulnerability of organisations to
threats, and designing cyber security transformation
programmes (see key recommendation FA1.KR1
in section 5.1).

HSE should also bring the governance of ongoing
tactical IT and cybersecurity improvement projects,
that have been initiated following recommendations
from the retained Incident Response provider under
the tactical cybersecurity improvement programme
(see key recommendation FA1.KR7 and KR8 in
section 5.1).

2. Security monitoring
2.1 Ensure that the HSE’s Incident Response
provider’s managed defence service or an
equivalent is maintained to detect and respond
to incidents on endpoints (i.e. laptops, desktops,
servers etc.) to provide protection to the entirety
of the NHN.
The HSE has engaged their Incident Response
provider to continue providing a managed detection
and response service. This capability is the most
crucial defence HSE has against further ransomware
attacks at present, providing a valuable ‘safety net’
given the inherent weaknesses in cyber security
controls across the estate (see key recommendation
FA1.KR6 in section 5.1).

This role should be responsible for placing
governance around cybersecurity improvements
(see immediate tactical action 1.5), identifying a
sustainable medium-term managed detection and
response solution (see immediate tactical action 2.1),
and leading the cybersecurity response to cyber
incidents. The role should also be responsible for
developing processes to manage third-parties that
provide security services, and providing the expertise
to oversee the successful delivery of these.

The HSE should identify a sustainable plan to
ensure the HSE’s Incident Response provider
service or an equivalent service is continued across
all organisations connected to the NHN. Whether
through formalising the continuation of the current
service, or replacing in parts of the NHN with a
new service, the objective should be to ensure that
equivalent levels of service are maintained, including:
using Endpoint Detection and Response tooling
to detect malicious activity on endpoints; 24/7
monitoring; and triage and investigation of
security alerts.

1.5 Formalise a programme and governance to
respond to tactical recommendations arising
from the Incident Response investigation and
provide assurance over their implementation.

2.2 Establish an initial cybersecurity incident
monitoring and response capability to drive
immediate improvement to the ability to detect
and respond to cybersecurity events.

The HSE should mobilise a tactical cybersecurity
improvement programme, with governance that feeds
into the interim CISO (see immediate tactical action
1.4) and can provide updates on the programme’s
progress into the Board committee. Dedicated
resources should be used to deliver this programme.

The HSE should drive immediate improvement to
the ability to detect and respond to cybersecurity
events, by augmenting the existing security
operations function with additional team members
with experience and expertise in cybersecurity
monitoring and response. This augmented team
should document, establish and operate an initial
process to triage, investigate, contain and respond to
cybersecurity events (see key recommendation FA1.
KR11 a in section 5.1).

The programme should be structured around tactical
work packages that can be delivered at pace
using focused governance and reporting to drive
accountability. The programme should also include
a process to triage all third party recommendations,
and fixes to security control gaps identified internally,
into tactical or strategic activities.

41 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

3. Ability to respond to a similar
incident in the near future
3.1 Review the process for managing internal
crisis communications including resources.
The HSE should formalise and document the process
required to manage internal communications during
a crisis response similar to that required in the
Incident, including cascading call trees and audience
segmentation via secure ‘out of band’ notification and
communication platforms (see key recommendation
FA2.KR19 in section 5.2).
The HSE should assess the requirements of their
internal communications process and plan for a crisis
response similar to that required in the Incident and
allocate adequate resources to grow the Internal
Communications team (see key recommendation
FA2.KR6 in section 5.2).
3.2 Develop a plan for response and
management of an NHN-wide similar incident
taking recent learnings into account.
The HSE should develop, document and exercise a
plan for managing and coordinating a cybersecurity
incident involving multiple organisations connected
to the NHN. This plan should be invoked by any
organisations connected to the NHN if they detected
a security incident that may have wider implications.
The HSE IT and security teams should identify
documents required to respond to a ransomware
attack (e.g. network diagrams, asset list) and secure
these in a cloud repository (see key recommendation
FA1.KR11 f in section 5.1).
3.3 Establish retainers with appropriate SLAs
for third party incident and crisis management
response support, together with processes and
sufficient internal expertise to direct and manage
the third-parties.
The HSE should ensure it has a fit-for-purpose set
of capabilities under retained contract with external
providers to enable a more effective response
to an incident similar to the Incident in the near
future. This should include support for operation
of crisis management functions, legal support and
cybersecurity incident response services (see FA2.
KR13 in section 5.2).
The HSE should also ensure that they have
developed the processes to effectively manage these
retained third-parties in the event of an incident,
and that they have sufficient expertise to provide
challenge and understand the implications of what

42 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

the third-parties are reporting to them (see immediate
tactical recommendation 1.4).
The HSE should work with the retained cybersecurity
incident response provider to ensure they have
sufficient understanding of the HSE’s organisation
and technology, and be available within defined
service level agreements to assist the HSE respond
to security alerts (see key recommendation
FA1.KR11 f in section 5.1).

4. IT environment
4.1 Implement an upgrade to NIMIS to allow
Windows 10 upgrade, thereby addressing known
vulnerabilities and support issues associated
with current wide deployment of Windows 7.
The HSE should prioritise the remediation of critical
legacy systems. Immediate efforts should focus on
prioritising the upgrade of the NIMIS system, as this
is currently inhibiting the upgrade of a significant
proportion of 30,000 Windows workstations from
Windows 7 to Windows 10.
In considering the acceleration of the NIMIS upgrade,
HSE should review if the configuration changes
made in one hospital (Hospital A) to enable the
application to run on Windows 10 can be more
widely implemented, and supported by the vendor,
to expedite the central Windows 10 rollout plans (see
key recommendation FA1.KR11 g in section 5.1).
4.2 Formalise existing roles and responsibilities
for IT across the entities accessing the NHN and
establish SLAs for centrally-provided services,
while also ensuring information security policies
align with those responsibilities.
The HSE should establish clear responsibilities for
IT and cybersecurity across all parties that connect
to the NHN, or share health data, or access shared
health services. This formalisation of responsibilities
should include specification of Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) for centrally-provided services,
including availability requirements.
The HSE should define a code of connection that
defines the minimum acceptable level of security
controls necessary to connect into the NHN, to be
agreed by all parties connected to the NHN, including
requirements for central reporting of cybersecurity
alerts and incidents. The HSE should establish
a programme to monitor and enforce ongoing
compliance with this code of conduct. Compliance
with the code of connection should become part
of the onboarding process of any connecting
organisation (see key recommendation FA1.KR11 e
in section 5.1).

Key findings and
recommendations
Conclusion

Summary of the Incident
The HSE’s Incident Response provider’s
investigation83 determined the ransomware attack
originated from a malware infection on a workstation
(“patient zero”) on 18 March 2021. Patient zero was
infected with malware after the workstation’s user
interacted with a malicious Microsoft Office Excel
document that was attached to a phishing email
received on 16 March 2021.
The user of patient zero was targeted with phishing
emails with the same email subject on four other
occasions between 14 December 2020 and 9
February 2021, but the workstation was not
successfully infected with malware. The HSE’s
Incident Response provider attributed the phishing
emails sent to patient zero to an Attacker84 they refer
to as UNC2633.85 The investigation also identified
additional workstations that were infected with
malware (as a result of phishing emails sent by
the Attacker UNC2633), with the earliest identified
infection occurring on 24 November 2020. However,
there is no evidence to indicate these infections
contributed to the ransomware incident.

87

After this Attacker gained unauthorised access to the
HSE’s IT environment on 18 March 2021, a second
Attacker continued to operate in the environment
until the execution of ransomware on 14 May 2021.
The HSE’s Incident Response provider identified
that the Attacker compromised 180 systems and
highly privileged accounts (typically
at least
required for performing administrative tasks (‘highly
privileged accounts’)) across eight organisations and
19 domains. The Incident Response provider also
identified over 2,800 servers and 3,500 workstations
across 15 domains, with evidence of encryption.
This likely represents a lower bound on the number
of systems encrypted, as some systems were
restored from backups or rebuilt prior to endpoint
agent deployment, reducing the Incident Response
provider’s ability to determine if encryption had
occurred.
The HSE’s Incident Response provider attributed
the second Attacker to be one that they refer to as
UNC2727.86 When investigating human-operated87
ransomware attacks it is common to identify evidence
of two Attackers, one that specialises in gaining
access to organisations, and another that specialises
in deploying ransomware and extortion. For the
purpose of clarity, unless otherwise stated when this
report refers to ‘the Attacker’, these references will
be to the activity attributed to the second Attacker

HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021
An individual or a group posing a threat.
This is a threat actor that sends phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links to gain access to organisations’
networks
This is a financially motivated group that the HSE’s Incident Response provider has tracked since April 2021. This group is known
to deploy Conti ransomware and / or exfiltrates victim data in support of their extortion efforts.
Human-operated ransomware attacks are different to traditional ransomware attacks in that they are ‘hands-on-keyboard’ attacks.
This involves human attackers using knowledge of offensive techniques and weaknesses in enterprise IT systems, to methodically
compromise organisations’ networks, compromise systems, overcome defence and cause maximum impact. The ransomware
attack that impacted HSE is an example of a human-operated ransomware attack. For further details see: https://www.pwc.com/

that the HSE’s Incident Response provider refer to as
UNC2727.

Our review noted that the impact of the ransomware
attack could have been more severe, for example:

The cyber attack was identified when the execution
of ransomware on 14 May 2021 caused widespread
IT disruption. Prior to this, none of the unauthorised
access, which began as early as 14 December
2020, was actively identified or contained within the
HSE environment. There were several detections of
malicious activity, but these did not result in a cyber
security incident or investigation being initiated.

•

if there had been intent by the Attacker to target
specific devices within the HSE environment (e.g.
medical devices);

•

if the ransomware took actions to destroy data at
scale;

•

if the ransomware had auto-propagation and
persistence capabilities, for example by using
an exploit to propagate across domains and
trust-boundaries to medical devices (e.g. the
EternalBlue exploit used by WannaCry and
NotPetya91);

•

if cloud systems had also been encrypted such as
the COVID-19 vaccination system.92

It was reported by the HSE’s management that 80%
of the IT environment across corporate IT services,
hospitals, CHOs and EHRs was encrypted,88 severely
disrupting healthcare services. The HSE’s Incident
Response provider identified encrypted files on 15
AD domains across the HSE, Hospital C, Hospital K,
Hospital D, Hospital L, Hospital J and Hospital B.89
The HSE’s Incident Response provider’s investigation
identified information exposure events relating to
email, AD data and file data across the HSE, Hospital
A, Hospital B, Hospital C and Hospital D.90

Our review also noted that the timeframe for
recovery could have been significantly longer had the
decryption key not been sourced, as the HSE would
have had to rely on recovering applications and
systems from backups at scale.

Focus area 1 - key findings
Preparedness to defend against and
respond to a ransomware cyber attack
There was a lack of preparedness within the HSE to
defend against or respond to a ransomware cyber
attack. Key findings that contributed to this position
include:
1. FA1.KF1 The HSE did not have a single
responsible owner for cybersecurity, at senior
executive or management level at the time
of the Incident. Limited scenario planning was
performed to prepare for a ransomware incident
(see focus area 2, area 12: scenario planning
below for further detail). Nor were there clear
articulations of the HSE’s risk to a large-scale
ransomware cyber attack that considered known
cybersecurity weaknesses. These, alongside
the lack of a detailed cybersecurity strategy,
operating model or transformation plan can likely
be attributed to this cybersecurity leadership
absence.
2. FA1.KF2 There was no dedicated committee
that provided direction and oversight of
cybersecurity and the activities required
to reduce the HSE’s cyber risk exposure.
A cybersecurity forum93 had previously been
established within the OoCIO but subsequently
disbanded before August 201994 without
replacement. There was a process where risks
were raised to OoCIO management, but there
was no centralised decision making committee to
provide direction and decide on a suitable course
of action to mitigate these risks, considering the
cybersecurity capabilities and controls required.
3. FA1.KF3 There were known weaknesses and
gaps in key cybersecurity controls. The Board
presentation on cybersecurity95 presented on
27 November 2020 highlighted there were many
areas of known cybersecurity weaknesses,
including known issues with excessive privileges
on accounts.

4. FA1.KF4 The lack of a cybersecurity forum
in the HSE hindered the ability for granular
cyber risks to be discussed and documented,
and for mitigating controls to be identified
and rapidly delivered. When gaps or issues
with cybersecurity controls and capabilities were
identified, there was no cybersecurity forum for
these to be raised at by OoCIO staff96 (see FA1.
KF2). As a result, once cyber risks were identified,
action was not always taken with sufficient
priority. One interviewee reported that petitioning
for security tool or process changes was a “war
of attrition”.
5. FA1.KF5 The HSE did not have a centralised
cybersecurity function that managed
cybersecurity risk and controls. There was
no centralised team to set the vision and
tone for security and perform critical security
functions, most notably security monitoring and
cybersecurity control assurance activities. Further,
it should be noted that at the time of the Incident
the senior cybersecurity SME, the Information
Security Manager, was not performing their
business as usual role that included the NISTbased cybersecurity review of OES systems,
but was working on evaluating the security
controls for the COVID-19 vaccination system.
This illustrates the lack of resources available for
important cybersecurity activities.
6. FA1.KF6 It was a known issue that the teams
that included elements of cybersecurity in their
remit were under-resourced.97 Further, within
the three cybersecurity teams (which had a total
FTE of 1598), team members predominantly had
IT backgrounds, not expertise and experience
in cybersecurity. These cybersecurity team
sizes do not correlate with the 4,000 locations
(1,200 networked), 130,000 staff,99 over 70,000
devices and 54 hospitals100 that make up the
health service. The HSE was therefore overly
reliant on its already stretched IT resources to
perform cybersecurity activities in good faith,
as evidenced by interview comments such as
“security is not in my job description but I do it
part time’’.

7. FA1.KF7 The HSE’s technology has grown
organically and is consequently overly
complex, increasing the vulnerability of the
HSE to cyber attacks. The HSE has a complex
technological environment that includes a
significant number of legacy systems, multiple onpremise email systems and multiple AD domains.

This included between
30,000 and 40,000 Windows 7 workstations101
that were deemed end of life by the vendor and
operating on extended support. Projects to
modernise, standardise and reduce complexity of
the IT estate were incomplete at the time of the
Incident. This can likely be attributed to: delays
reported in interviews as caused by the response
to COVID-19; the under-resourcing of technology
teams; the lack of a single governed programme
that maintained oversight, and the complexities of
the IT environment.
8. FA1.KF8 The HSE had a large and unclear
security boundary that encompassed many
of the organisations connected to the NHN.
The ‘flat’ design of the NHN with a lack of
network segmentation, paired with bi-direction
trust relationships between many AD domains,
resulted in many of the organisations connecting
to the NHN effectively being within the HSE’s
security boundary. This exposed the HSE to the
risk of cyber attacks from other organisations
connected to the NHN, as well as these other
organisations connected to the NHN to cyber
attacks originating from the HSE.

9. FA1.KF9 The HSE’s effective security boundary
did not align with its ability to mandate
cybersecurity controls. The HSE created a
network infrastructure where they did not have
the ability to mandate cyber controls to prevent
and detect ransomware attacks within all
organisations that fell within its security boundary
(see key finding FA1.KF8).
10. FA1.KF10 There was no effective security
monitoring capability that was able to detect,
investigate and respond to security alerts
across the HSE’s IT environment. The HSE did
not have the modern security tooling needed to
detect and prevent ransomware, nor did it have
trained security analysts internally or within a
Security Operations Center (“SOC”) that were
able to monitor the available antivirus alerts to
investigate, triangulate and respond to potential
threats.
Endpoint
11. FA1.KF11 The antivirus tool (
Security) was over-relied upon to detect and
prevent threats on endpoints. Solely relying on
antivirus is not sufficient to protect against the
tools and attack techniques used by ransomware
groups (and many other modern attackers).
Further it should be noted that this antivirus tool:
•

was not monitored 24/7;

•

was not deployed across the full endpoint
environment;

•

was evidenced as not being correctly
configured on all workstations;

•

was not configured to block malicious activity
within the server estate, only to monitor it.

12. FA1.KF12 The IT environment had highrisk gaps relating to 25 out of 28 of the
cybersecurity controls102 that are most
effective at detecting and preventing humanoperated ransomware attacks.103 A highlevel assessment of the HSE’s cybersecurity
capabilities, using PwC’s proprietary ransomware
readiness framework,104 at the time of the
Incident is shown in Figure 11. Further, of the
cybersecurity controls implemented, limited
assurance activities were performed to test their
operational efficiency. This assessment has been
performed to provide an illustration of the level
of cybersecurity controls in place at the time of
the incident specifically in relation to ransomware
attacks.
A Board presentation105 on cybersecurity
presented on 27 November 2020 highlighted how
several of these controls were areas of known
cybersecurity weakness, although the link to a
risk of widespread impact from a ransomware
attack was not made. Implementing many of
these controls would have been highly likely to
have prevented or detected techniques used by
the Attacker and therefore significantly increased
the Attacker’s difficulty in compromising the HSE
and achieving their objectives.
13. FA1.KF13 The HSE did not have a documented
cyber incident response plan and had not
performed typical preparatory activities
such as exercising the technical response.
The HSE did not have an exercised plan for
managing and coordinating a cybersecurity
incident that impacted the HSE as well as multiple
organisations across the NHN. There were no
documented cyber incident response runbooks
or IT recovery plans (apart from documented AD
recovery plans) for recovering from a wide-scale
ransomware event.

102 Based on PwC’s proprietary ransomware capability framework (see section Preparation: cybersecurity controls before the
ransomware attack for further detail), HSE is scored high or very high risk against 25 of the 28 capabilities
103 Human-operated ransomware attacks are different to traditional ransomware attacks in that they are ‘hands-on-keyboard’ attacks.
This involves human attackers using knowledge of offensive techniques and weaknesses in enterprise IT systems, to methodically
compromise organisations’ networks, compromise systems, overcome defence and cause maximum impact. The ransomware
attack that impacted HSE is an example of a human-operated ransomware attack. For further details see: https://www.pwc.com/
jg/en/publications/responding-to-growing-human-operated-ransomware-attacks-threat.pdf
104 PwC’s proprietary ransomware readiness framework lists the most important cybersecurity controls we have identified to prevent,
detect and respond to human-operated ransomware attacks. Focus area 1 used this framework as it allowed the review to evaluate
HSE’s cyber security controls at the time of the Incident against the specific threat of human-operated ransomware attacks. Focus
area 3 have performed a wider review of HSE’s cybersecurity preparedness and maturity levels using the NIST cybersecurity and
COBIT framework

Response to the ransomware cyber
attack
There were opportunities to detect malicious activity
prior to the detonation phase of the ransomware.
Following the execution of ransomware, the HSE
mobilised a response to overcome the significant
challenges posed by both the attack and its lack of
preparedness.
Key findings relating to the response to Attacker
activity in the days leading up to the Incident include:
1. FA1.KF14 The cyber attack was not
actively identified or contained prior to the
ransomware execution, despite the Attacker
performing noisy and ‘unstealthy’ actions. The
investigation determined that the ransomware
attack originated from a malware infection on
patient zero on 18 March 2021, when the user
opened a malicious Microsoft Office Excel
document that was attached to a phishing email.
Following this, the Attacker continued to operate
in the environment, including compromising and
abusing a significant number of highly privileged
(e.g., system administrator) accounts and moving
laterally to both statutory and voluntary hospitals.
Many of the tools and techniques employed
by the Attacker during this time period (which
included the use of basic and non-obfuscated
malicious PowerShell commands), were wellknown to be used by ransomware groups. As
such, they would have almost certainly been
identified by modern security monitoring tooling
and a security monitoring capability. It should
be noted that the HSE’s antivirus tool (
Endpoint Security) did record detections of these
tools106 but these were not actively identified or
thoroughly investigated by the HSE’s teams (see
next finding).

2. FA1.KF15 The HSE’s antivirus identified a
tool commonly used by ransomware groups
(Cobalt Strike) on six servers on 7 May 2021
(and several more servers in the following
days) but these alerts were not appropriately
actioned. The HSE did not identify these alerts
until after their cybersecurity solutions provider
flagged them on 12 May 2021107 and 13 May
2021.108 At that point, the retained third party
‘critical incident response service’, was not
invoked,109 despite the alerts being for a tool
commonly used by ransomware groups (Cobalt
Strike) and being across multiple servers. The
response to these detections was not sufficient as
the HSE did not; invoke a cybersecurity incident;
escalate the cybersecurity incident; identify the
severity of the threat; or thoroughly investigate
and contain the threat. This was a result of
insufficient cybersecurity expertise to understand
the significance of these detections and an
absence of cyber response governance and
processes to guide the response to cybersecurity
incidents.
3. FA1.KF16 Two voluntary hospitals identified
suspicious activity prior to the execution of
ransomware, but a HSE centralised response
was not initiated. On 10 May 2021, Hospital C
identified activity on a domain controller (“DC”)
that they suspected as malicious and so sought
advice from Hospital C’s cybersecurity solutions
provider on whether the alerts warranted
concern.110 The third-party stated that since
the threat has been handled by their antivirus
tool that “the risk is low here”. As a result of the
third party’s email response, Hospital C did not
initiate a cyber incident response investigation,
and therefore did not identify a cybersecurity
incident. On the evening of 12 May 2021, Hospital
A notified the OoCIO that its network had been
compromised111 and suspected malicious activity
was originating from the HSE.112,113 The HSE
performed an IT-centric investigation on 13 May
2021 that incorrectly concluded that the HSE was
“under threat from Hospital A, not the other way
around”.114 Following this, the HSE did not seek
the help of an external cyber incident response
firm nor the NCSC to investigate and provide
guidance on how to respond to the detections.

The HSE did not link these events to the antivirus
tool detections that their cybersecurity solutions
provider had notified.
4. FA1.KF17 Two organisations successfully
acted on detections of the Attacker preventing
the deployment of ransomware within their
estates. The DoH and Hospital A successfully
acted on alerts and detections of suspicious
activity, and engaged third-party incident
response services. The DoH quickly deployed
EDR security tooling115 that was then able to
prevent the ransomware from executing on the
majority of its infrastructure, including critical and
data servers. Hospital A engaged the Hospital
A’s Incident Response provider, who worked
with them to use their already deployed security
tool. Had the HSE responded in a similar fashion
(particularly following the escalations made by
Hospital A and the HSE’s cybersecurity solutions
provider) then it is likely that the widespread
encryption of the HSE environment would have
been prevented.
Key findings relating to the response to the
detonation phase of the ransomware attack include:
1. FA1.KF18 The HSE with the help of thirdparties mobilised a response to the
ransomware attack and overcame many of
the significant challenges the ransomware
attack presented, drawing on their experience
responding to crises, including COVID-19. The
HSE recognised the need for additional resources
and specialist skills and engaged third parties
for incident response116,117 legal and forensics
support early on. The impact of the Incident
on a national scale encouraged goodwill from
third party support and vendors, including the
provision of pro bono work. This allowed a good
cadence to be established within 24-48 hours
that included multiple daily standups, Major
Incident (MI) meetings and other programme
governance. The HSE developed effective
response structures and processes that evolved
over the course of the response. The decision to
set up a physical hub for operations in Citywest
(on 21 May 2021118) was widely reported as being
invaluable to working collaboratively between
different response and recovery teams, whilst also
boosting morale.

115
116
117
118
119
120

2. FA1.KF19 The HSE was reliant on third-parties
in the early weeks of the Incident to provide
structure to the response activities. The first
physical hub for senior management was set
up 15 May 2021119 in a third party organisation,
before moving to accommodation at Citywest
on 21 May 2021.120 The Defence Forces were
brought in 18 May 2021 and were widely reported
in interviews to have provided key response
structures.
3. FA1.KF20 Time was lost during the response
due to a lack of pre-planning for high impact
technology events. The HSE was not prepared
to respond to a cyber incident of this scale
(“everything going offline”) due to the lack of
defined and exercised response processes and
plans. Key examples of this include:
•

No cybersecurity response plans and
playbooks;

•

No security tooling capable of investigating
and remediating security alerts;

•

No centralised list of contact details for all
HSE staff or asset register;

•

No offline copies of key IT and security
documentation were kept, for example
network diagrams;

•

No pre-established prioritised list of
applications and systems for recovery, based
on clinical services, that was cognisant of
cross-technology dependencies;

•

No pre-agreed, setup and tested out-of-band
communication system that would enable
users to communicate in the event of a
cybersecurity incident. Multiple collaboration
and communication platforms were used
after the Incident resulting in confusion and
team members not being able to easily
communicate; increasing the day-to-day
difficulty of responders.

4. FA1.KF21 The HSE spent a significant
amount of time during the response
gathering information about applications,
as this information was not recorded and
up-to-date in a central or offline application
register. The lack of centralised information
about applications caused inefficiencies in the
response as the HSE did not have up-to-date
information on applications. This meant that as
part of their response, they had to develop a
list of applications that were in use within the
corporate, acute and community spaces. As well
as identify and define missing details such as
the application’s owner, its priority for recovery,
details of the systems they were hosted on and in
some cases the application’s purpose. For some
applications, the HSE was reliant on vendors to
pull this information together, and provide the
information critical to the application’s recovery.
5. FA1.KF22 There was a heavy reliance on
specific individuals during the response. This
likely contributed to a recovery timeline that
was longer than could have been achieved.
There was a heavy reliance on key members
of staff in IT teams that effectively caused
bottlenecks. This was due to the large scope
of their BAU IT roles and responsibilities, the
lack of IT resourcing and a lack of documented
and standardised information and procedures.
This concentration of knowledge prevented
opportunities for further delegation (such as
acquiring more burst capacity from third parties)
and meant that the HSE had limited response
resilience if these individuals had become
unavailable during the critical weeks of the
response.
6. FA1.KF23 The response initially prioritised
the recovery of foundational systems,
and applications on the OES list121, before
advancing to an approach that focused on
clinical risks and the recovery of end-to-end
clinical services. Before the incident there
was not a complete and documented list that
prioritised all HSE applications and systems. As
a result IT teams initially focused on restoring
the seven priority clinical applications that were
identified in the OES list.122 The recovery strategy
advanced from the restoration of these seven
applications, to be centered around recovery
of end-to-end clinical service (including the
dependencies of applications to restore end-to-

end clinical services) following the co-location of
all responders to Citywest on 21 May 2021.123
7. FA1.KF24 There was a lack of clearly defined
and delineated decision making authority
between the HSE, hospitals and CHOs in the
case of a health service-wide crisis. After the
ransomware attack was identified, the OoCIO
gave a central mandate to power down systems
and wait for instructions (whilst they assessed
the impact and established next steps) as there
was not a delineated decision making structure
to allow for local nuances. At least one hospital
(Hospital B) used a third party to review their
environment and confirm that it was unaffected by
the ransomware. Invoking local decision making
during this initial interim period allowed the
hospital to regain IT systems and provide critical
radiotherapy services within the first week of the
Incident.
8. FA1.KF25 The OoCIO was not able to provide
or source (through third party burst capacity)
the scale of the IT support required by
hospitals and CHOs during the extended
response to restore applications, systems
and services at pace. The centralised IT team
structure of the HSE meant that little IT subject
matter expertise was available locally within the
HSE’s hospitals and CHOs. It was widely reported
by hospitals and CHOs124 that they were heavily
reliant on the central OoCIO IT resources for
response activities and on personal relationships
with OoCIO IT teams to progress and unblock
tasks. The OoCIO IT resources were however,
already stretched performing national ransomware
attack response activities and therefore struggled
to effectively prioritise this help.
9. FA1.KF26 The HSE had limited to no ability to
investigate the attack using its own tooling.
The HSE was not centrally collecting and retaining
logging from systems, network and security
tooling. The central collation point for their
antivirus alerts (the antivirus management server)
was encrypted and deemed unrecoverable as a
result of the ransomware attack. The encryption
of the antivirus server meant that the HSE was
unable to determine the circumstances and audit
trail surrounding what detections were reported
back to the central console in the lead up to the
ransomware execution. Therefore, without the
deployment of their Incident Response provider’s

endpoint agent the HSE would have had no ability
to perform forensic analysis over their systems
and therefore fully investigate the attack.
10. FA1.KF27 The HSE’s Incident Response
provider identified evidence of how the
Attacker was able to gain unauthorised access
to the HSE’s IT environment and the Attacker’s
subsequent activities. The HSE worked closely
with their Incident Response provider to ensure
they had the available information required to
enable an effective investigation and response.
This resulted in an investigation that identified
evidence of how the Attacker was able to gain
unauthorised access to the HSE’s IT environment
and what the Attacker did once they were able to
gain this access.
Key findings from the investigation125 included that
the Attacker:
•

gained unauthorised access to the HSE network
through a phishing email on 18 March 2021 (this
activity was attributed to the Attacker the HSE’s
Incident Response provider refer to as UNC2633);

•

used a number of tools commonly utilised by
human-operated ransomware groups to perform
reconnaissance and move laterally through the
HSE’s environment (compromising 180 systems);

•

used the network connectivity provided by the
NHN as well as the bidirectional trust between
several AD domains to easily move laterally
across to six voluntary hospitals and one statutory
hospital;

•

used an exploit that was widely publicised as a
critical patch126 to gain access to the networks of
two hospitals;

•

compromised at least
highly privileged
accounts127 across HSE, Hospital A, Hospital K,
Hospital L, Hospital J and Hospital B;128

•

browsed local or remote folders on systems
across HSE and four organisations;

•

opened files and attempted to view them using
RDP;129

•

made copies of files;

•

created archives (.zip and .rar) of files;

•

accessed the file sharing website Domain A; and,

•

deployed ransomware throughout several
organisations connected to the NHN.

Additionally, the
malware (which
includes an Outlook module to harvest contact
information and email content from infected hosts)
was identified on several hosts within the HSE’s
environment. An output from the execution of this
module was identified on one system within the
domain.
HSE’s
The investigation was unable to identify conclusive
evidence that data exposed to the Attacker was
then successfully exfiltrated by the Attacker out of
the HSE’s environment (for example to a file sharing
website). However, it is known that the Attacker
provided samples of the HSE’s and Hospital D’s
(a Section 38 hospital and therefore independent
data controller130) data in a chat room (accessed via
a link in the ransom note) and that some data was
published on the dark web.131 It is also known that
the Financial Times published redacted extracts of
the published data (which was verified as originating
from the attack on 14 May 2021)132 and then worked
to provide a copy of this data to the HSE’s Incident
Response provider on 25 May 2021.133
Hospital D conducted its own review of the data
provided by the Financial Times and made a decision
to notify identified data subjects as per Article 34
GDPR.134 The HSE reviewed the data provided by
the Financial Times and confirmed that the HSE
data related to a Statutory Hospital (“Hospital M”),
for which the HSE is the data controller. The HSE
assessed the personal data risk to the rights and
freedoms of individuals within this data set to be
low135 and therefore it was deemed not necessary to
inform the relevant data subjects.

The HSE retained a third party to conduct additional
in-depth forensic analysis on the systems identified
by their Incident Response provider (where data
was exposed to the threat actor), to determine the
probability of data exfiltration from these systems
and to identify any other potential data exposure and
exfiltration sources. The HSE has also retained two
third party services to perform ongoing dark web and
web monitoring activities.
At the time of this report, the work aligned to the
HSE’s Legal and Data workstream established on
19 May 2021136 is ongoing. As of yet, therefore the
HSE has not made any data subject notifications but
continues to work closely with the DPC.

The impact of and recovery from the
ransomware cyber attack
Due to the scale and impact of the ransomware,
paired with the complex and legacy IT environment,
the technical recovery of IT systems has been
challenging. Key findings on the technical impact of
the Incident include:
1. FA1.KF28 The impact of the ransomware on
the IT environment was reported by the HSE’s
management to lead to 80%137 encryption. The
HSE’s Incident Response provider’s investigation
identified encrypted files on systems within the
HSE and the following voluntary and statutory
hospitals: Hospital C; Hospital K; Hospital D;
Hospital L; Hospital J and Hospital B.138 The
HSE was the most impacted by the ransomware
attack, with all nine of its domains displaying
evidence of encryption.139 In total, the HSE’s
Incident Response provider identified over
2,800 servers and 3,500 workstations across 15
domains, with evidence of encryption.140 This
likely represents a lower bound on the number
of systems encrypted, as some systems were
restored from backups or rebuilt prior to endpoint
agent deployment, reducing the HSE’s Incident
Response provider’s ability to determine if
encryption had occurred.

136
137
138
139
140

2. FA1.KF29 The impact of the ransomware
attack on communications was severe, as the
HSE almost exclusively used on-premise email
) that
systems (Exchange and
were encrypted, and therefore unavailable,
during the attack. The HSE had begun to
migrate users to Exchange Online
but this was limited to pilot projects at the time
of the Incident and had been identified by the
HSE as a complex project to deliver. Had the
HSE invested in reducing email complexity and
completed migrating staff to Exchange Online, the
impact of the ransomware on email would have
likely been minimal, reducing the impact to team
collaboration. See key finding FA1.KF38 for the
detail regarding email recovery.
Key findings on the recovery include:
3. FA1.KF30 The HSE took action to contain
the ransomware attack by powering down
systems and disconnecting the NHN from the
internet. These containment steps restricted the
ability of the Attacker to further their activities and
in the face of spreading ransomware within an
architecturally open environment were the most
pragmatic. The HSE did not have the realistic
option of carrying out a more compartmentalised
approach that accounted for the impact on
organisations, due to the open design of the
NHN, the immaturity of cybersecurity controls and
governance, and as this had not been planned for
or rehearsed.
4. FA1.KF31 It is unclear how much data would
have been lost if a decryption key had not
become available. It was reported that online
backups were encrypted in places and that
secondary backups to tape were only made
periodically. Therefore it is highly likely that
segments of data would have been unrecoverable
from backups, and a full recovery of data was
only possible due to the provision of a decryption
key by the Attacker.
5. FA1.KF32 Without the decryption key, it is
unknown how long it would have taken to
recover systems from backups but it would
have likely taken considerably longer. Prior
to receiving the decryption key, the HSE was
recovering systems from backups. This would
have required a significant amount of IT resources
and equipment to be undertaken at the scale
required to recover all servers and applications.

6. FA1.KF33 The HSE missed opportunities for
efficiencies in the recovery of systems and
applications due to a lack of preparedness.
The lack of preparedness for a widespread
disruptive IT event often created bottlenecks and
prevented teams from being able to get to work
on the highest priority tasks. In particular, the
lack of a comprehensive, current asset register
mapped to critical services delayed recovery
efforts due to the wait between teams as this
information was gathered and through unknown
dependencies creating inefficiencies.
7. FA1.KF34 The processes and response
structures for recovering systems and
applications were designed and developed in
response to the Incident. Many of the processes
used to recover systems and applications were
developed during the crisis. This resulted in a
lack of immediate awareness, understanding and
implementation of agreed processes from staff
members potentially increasing the HSE’s cyber
risk at the time of the response. For example,
there was at least one instance of a potentially
compromised system being reconnected to the
network (before it was confirmed as clean and
pre-authorised by the HSE’s Incident Response
provider and the Tech Team141), inadvertently
exposing the HSE to a heightened level of risk.
8. FA1.KF35 The HSE’s Incident Response
provider and the HSE, developed go-togreen processes142,143,144 to ensure the secure
recovery of systems and reduce the risk of
further ransomware attacks. The HSE’s Incident
Response provider and the HSE developed
requirements that every system within the HSE,
voluntaries and CHOs must meet before being
able to rejoin the network, and for organisations
to be reconnected back to the NHN and the
internet.

9. FA1.KF36 The complexities of recovering
applications and systems were not well
understood. Due to the unknown dependencies
between systems and a lack of recovery process
pre-planning, recovery efforts were complicated.
For example, recovery teams reported that it was
difficult to facilitate vendor support. As a result,
workarounds (such as using screen shares to
provide vendors with temporary access) had
to be employed. These workarounds were also
in some cases further complicated through the
inconsistency in access to collaboration tools
(see response to the detonation phase of the
ransomware attack key findings FA1.KF18 - FA1.
KF27).
10. FA1.KF37 Despite the challenges presented
by the ransomware attack and the lack of
preparedness, the HSE was able to recover
1,075 applications and over 87,000 systems.145
Our review consistently noted the willingness
of HSE staff members across the organisation
to come together and contribute wherever
needed to deliver services to patients. The
HSE recovered their primary identity systems (
AD domain) within a matter of days
after the ransomware attack. The HSE was able
to prioritise and restore applications and systems
during the response including:
•

After one month, the HSE was able to decrypt
47% of servers and fully restore 48% of Acute
applications, 40% of Community Services
applications and 64% of business services
applications.146

•

After two months, the HSE was able to
decrypt 94% of servers and fully restore 85%
of Acute applications, 94% of Community
Services applications and 79% of business
services applications.147

•

After three months, the HSE reported that
100% of servers were decrypted and they
were able to fully restore 95% of Acute
applications, 98% of Community Services
applications and 91% of business services
applications.148

11. FA1.KF38 HSE had significant issues with
restoring email back to normal operations
for users, resulting in ongoing disruption to
employees. Due to the complexity of the email
infrastructure, even when the service was itself
restored, user level disruptions such as empty
mail boxes continued to affect staff’s ability to
perform recovery and BAU activities. Ongoing
disruption with email services impacted the staff’s
ability to recover applications and systems. Since
the ransomware attack, there has been over
38,000 tickets raised with the national service
desk relating to ongoing issues with email.149 Over
20,000 of those tickets were raised between 20
July 2021150 and 21 September 2021.151
12. FA1.KF39 The strategy to prioritise national
systems recovery over local systems meant
that statutory hospitals and CHOs that were
not yet using ‘standard’ infrastructure (some
with limited local IT resources) experienced
recovery delays. Organisations not yet
using ‘standard’ infrastructure (for example,
organisations not using national applications)
were effectively deprioritised by the strategy to
prioritise national systems. This was then further
compounded for hospitals and CHOs with little
to no IT resource and who were therefore wholly
reliant on the OoCIO for their recovery.

Sustainable reduction of risk since the
ransomware attack
The focus of the HSE’s activities since the attack has
been on implementing recommendations provided
by third parties and to continue to recover systems.
Limited evidence has been provided to show that
activity has yet to take place to ensure that the HSE’s
cyber risk exposure is reduced sustainably.

1. FA1.KF40 The HSE engaged their Incident
Response provider to continue providing a
managed detection and response service to
March 2022. This capability is the most crucial
defence the HSE has against further ransomware
attacks at present, and provides a valuable ‘safety
net’ given the inherent weaknesses in cyber
security controls across the estate. The HSE has
not yet identified a long-term replacement for the
managed detection and response service, with
the current solution ending in March 2022.152
2. FA1.KF41 The HSE increased the scope of
services provided by the current third parties
to provide 24x7 monitoring capability of its
antivirus tool153 and cloud environment.154
The HSE’s cybersecurity solutions provider
and Third Party B provide a 24x7 security
monitoring service limited to the antivirus tool (
Endpoint Security) and Microsoft Cloud
platforms155 (which includes the HSE
tenancy156) respectively.
3. FA1.KF42 Improvements to the HSE’s in-house
Security Operations capability (for example
defining processes and documenting response
roles) have not yet been implemented. These
improvements along with other immediate
improvements identified are critically important
to ensure that alerts of malicious activity will be
investigated and escalated with due care. As of
yet there is little evidence to show that any ‘quick
fixes’ to the HSE’s security monitoring capability
have been implemented beyond the retaining of
third party monitoring services.

Key findings on the improvements made by the HSE
post cyber incident, and on HSE’s current approach
and current ability to sustainably reduce cyber risk,
include:

4. FA1.KF43 The HSE was not empowered to
mandate that voluntary hospitals continue
with the improved levels of security monitoring
(or other security controls); this could expose
the health service to the risk of further cyber
attacks. The HSE does not have the authority to
mandate voluntary hospitals continue to use the
HSE’s Incident Response provider’s Managed
Defence monitoring agent or replace this with
a like-for-like replacement (which will require
ongoing cybersecurity expenditure). If voluntary
hospitals do not maintain the current capability
or procure a similar, market leading solution, then
this will expose the HSE and wider health service
to risk of further cyber attacks. This illustrates
how the HSE’s security boundary continues
to be misaligned with their ability to mandate
cybersecurity controls.
5. FA1.KF44 A finalised security improvement
plan157,158,159,160 does not exist and the
draft security improvement plan and
programme161,162,163,164 is unlikely to significantly
reduce the risk of future ransomware attacks.
The current draft plan and programme is a
consolidation of IT projects and identified gaps. It
also highlights the need to create a final security
improvement plan with defined governance and
accountability across the organisation. Therefore
at present no improvement plan exists that is
structured or architected using a cyber threat
view that centres on improvements around key
cybersecurity capability areas that are most
effective at detecting and preventing humanoperated ransomware attacks. It does identify
some gaps in these capability areas as items
to be addressed in long-term planning165 but it
should be noted that improvement in these gaps
are crucial to reducing the risk of ransomware
attacks in the short term.

6. FA1.KF45 A holistic view of cybersecurity
improvement activities does not yet exist
which increases the risk that foundational
improvement activities will be missed. There
is a risk that the HSE’s current approach to focus
action around the remediation activities outlined
by their Incident Response provider, will likely
lead to a piecemeal approach that does not
take account of the fundamental root causes of
such issues. For example, at present it is well
known that there are issues with the coordination
and tracking of the response to security alerts
between technology teams, but the resolution of
this is not yet included within any finalised plans.
7. FA1.KF46 There is no centralised governance
programme that maintains oversight of
identified cybersecurity improvements,
resulting in a lack of clarity about what has
been delivered and what remains to be
done. Improvement actions are currently being
discussed at technological operational meetings
and a programme management governance
structure to oversee these activities and produce
centralised progress figures against agreed
milestones is yet to be developed. This has
resulted in a lack of clarity around what security
improvements have been delivered, and what
security improvements still need to be delivered in
response to the Incident.
8. FA1.KF47 A cybersecurity transformation
programme, that will sustainably reduce
cybersecurity risk in the long term, has not
been planned, approved or resourced. Some
initial security improvement documents166,167,168,169,
as outlined in key finding FA1.KF44, exist
but these do not articulate the scale of
necessary change or detail the plan for such
a transformation. Both a cyber transformation
plan and a framework to help achieve that plan
are required that will redesign how the HSE
manages and maintains its cyber risk within its
extensive technological estate (see medium-term
recommendation FA1.KR13 for further detail).

9. FA1.KF48 The HSE still has a significant
amount of legacy IT that needs to be
modernised.

10. FA1.KF49 Key artefacts created within the
response are not yet being centrally and
systematically collated. The HSE was able to
gather a significant amount of information in the
middle of a crisis about the applications that were
being used across the HSE, hospitals and CHOs.
In addition, design response processes were
created such as communication structures and
recovery tracking dashboards (for example the
decryption tracking trello board). These artefacts
will be invaluable in the event of a similar attack
in future. It is therefore critical that information is
now collated and appropriately managed going
forward.

should also be responsible for planning and
mobilising teams to deliver a cybersecurity
transformation required to sustainably reduce
the HSE’s risk to ransomware attacks. The
CISO should be at National Director level, a
direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate
access to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure
that cybersecurity risks are understood and
considered in all decision-making. This interim
senior leader should be given the ability to source
the necessary expertise from the market to build
a team that can give effect to the immediate
recommendations listed in this section, and to
begin planning for the implementation of mediumterm recommendations. The prioritisation for the
approval of a CISO and a cyber security team
has been recorded within the Q2 Divisional Risk
Register as an ‘action control’ to Risk ID 130 with
a due date of 30 June 2022.170

Focus area 1 - Key
recommendations

2. FA1.KR2 Establish an executive-level
cybersecurity oversight committee, to drive
continuous assessment of cybersecurity risk
across the provision of health services (see
strategic recommendation 1.2 in Section 4.1).
A dedicated executive oversight committee is
needed to provide direction and oversight to
cybersecurity, both within the HSE and across
other parties connected to the NHN.

Key recommendations are outlined below. These
have been split between those that are for immediate
consideration and those that should follow in the
medium-term (as they require further planning and
preparation). The HSE should begin planning for
the delivery of medium term recommendations
immediately, in parallel to implementing the
immediate recommendations, and start the
implementation phase of these medium-term
recommendations within six months:

3. FA1.KR3 Create a Board committee, to
oversee the transformation of IT and
cybersecurity to deliver a future-fit, resilient
technology base for provision of digitallyenabled health services (see strategic
recommendation 1.4 in Section 4.1). The HSE
should consider the inclusion of further specialist
non-executive members of the committee in order
to provide additional expertise and insight to the
committee.

Immediate recommendation 1

4. FA1.KR4 Plan a multi-year cybersecurity
transformation programme, and identify
and mobilise the resources to deliver (see
strategic recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1).
In parallel to delivering the tactical cybersecurity
improvement programme, the HSE’s appointed
interim CISO should plan a cybersecurity
transformation that will build lasting cybersecurity
capabilities and sustainably reduce cyber risk
exposure. This cybersecurity transformation
programme should be validated at the Board
level. The HSE should also identify suitable
resources and expertise to plan and deliver this
transformation.

1. FA1.KR1 Appoint an interim senior leader for
cybersecurity (a CISO) who has experience
rapidly reducing organisations’ vulnerability
to threats and designing cyber security
transformation programmes (see tactical
recommendation 1.4 in Section 4.2). The
HSE should appoint an interim senior leader
for cybersecurity to be responsible for placing
governance around cybersecurity improvements,
identifying a sustainable medium-term managed
detection and response solution (see immediate
recommendation FA1.KR6), identifying future
strategy for detection and response and
leading the implementation of the immediate
recommendations from this review. This role
170 DRR Q2 2021, 19 November 2020

59 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

© 2021 PwC. All rights reserved.

5. FA1.KR5 Appoint a programme lead and
define the governance framework for the
cybersecurity transformation programme
(see strategic recommendation 3.1 in Section
4.1). A programme lead with experience in
cybersecurity transformation should be appointed
by the HSE’s interim CISO to drive the execution
of this transformation. It is critical that this
programme lead can work hand in glove with the
HSE’s technologies teams, to help orchestrate
secure technological transformation.
6. FA1.KR6 Continue to use a managed detection
and response service provided by a third
party and identify a sustainable medium-term
solution (see tactical recommendation 2.1 in
Section 4.2). The current service provided by the
HSE’s Incident Response provider is the most
crucial defence the HSE currently has against
further ransomware attacks. If the HSE decides to
onboard a new managed detection and response
service, it should ensure there is an overlap
between this and the HSE’s Incident Response
provider’s current service, so that there are no
periods when the IT environment is not monitored.

third parties, the HSE should also include
recommendations by performing:

•

7. FA1.KR7 Mobilise a tactical cybersecurity
improvement programme171 (while the
cybersecurity transformation programme is
being planned), with governance that feeds
into the interim CISO and can provide updates
on the programme’s progress into the Board
committee (see tactical recommendation 1.5
in Section 4.2). Dedicated cybersecurity and
technology resources should be used to deliver a
tactical cybersecurity improvement programme,
consisting of tactical work packages that can
be delivered at pace using focused governance
and reporting to drive accountability. To create
these work packages, the HSE should action the
following activities:
•

•

Triage - All third party recommendations and fixes
to the security control gaps identified internally
should be triaged into tactical or strategic
activities. Tactical activities should be those that
will rapidly reduce the risk of ransomware attacks
and are achievable in 60 days or less. Note that
where improvements are identified as strategic,
the HSE should consider what additional tactical
improvements can be implemented in the shortterm to reduce risk and act as mitigating controls.
Test and Assess - As well as the
recommendations it has received from

–

AD security assessments;

–

Vulnerability scanning of all internet-facing IP
addresses;

–

Vulnerability scanning of all internal IP address
ranges;

–

A comprehensive assessment of current
capabilities and planned improvements
against a framework that identifies key
capabilities to defend against humanoperated ransomware attacks (such as the
proprietary ransomware readiness framework
used in this report or that recently published
by CISA172).

Architect - Following the triaging activity, the
HSE should use cybersecurity experts to architect
and manage a series of tactical work packages
to deliver the tactical improvements identified by
the triage process. These should be designed
to deliver directly and rapidly reduce the risk of
ransomware attacks, and be achievable in 60
days or less. Examples of tactical work packages
include:
–

Uplift detection and response capability;

–

Remediate priority infrastructure
vulnerabilities;

–

Lock down remote access methods;

–

Protect privileged accounts;

–

Improve service account hygiene;

–

Remediate AD hygiene issues;

–

Secure local administrator accounts;

–

Enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for
all remote access methods;

–

Restrict internet access to servers.

This governance should directly feed progress
updates into the Board committee. These progress
updates should clearly articulate:
•

the HSE’s vulnerability to ransomware attacks;

•

the risk reduction achieved by improvement
activities that have been delivered;,

•

the extent of the improvements required to reduce
the risk of ransomware attacks to an acceptable
level.

8. FA1.KR8 Bring the governance of ongoing
IT and cybersecurity improvement projects
under the tactical cybersecurity improvement
programme (see tactical recommendation 1.5
in Section 4.2). Governance of current on-going
IT projects, that directly or indirectly result in
cyber risk reduction, should be brought under the
tactical cybersecurity improvement programme’s
governance (and therefore the CISO see key
recommendation FA1.KR7), so the cyber risk
reduction they deliver can be tracked, and any
risk and issues can be resolved. For example,
modernisation projects such as the upgrading of
Windows 7 OS and platform modernisation.
9. FA1.KR9 Use security testing ‘find and fix’ to
identify additional security weaknesses and
vulnerabilities by simulating cyber attack
techniques, before identifying and triaging
pragmatic fixes (see tactical recommendation
1.5 in Section 4.2). Security testing should be
used to focus tactical improvement activities.
By simulating the threat of human-operated
ransomware attacks, improvements that make
it more difficult for an Attacker to successfully
compromise the organisation can be identified.
The HSE should bring together red team
experts173 and cybersecurity engineers to
identify pragmatic fixes to the vulnerabilities and
weaknesses identified. These fixes should then
be triaged with IT and Security teams to assess
their feasibility and identify how best to deliver
them (see key recommendation FA1.KR7 Triage).
Security testing should then be used to validate
improvements have been correctly implemented.
10. FA1.KR10 Schedule a ‘red team’ ethical
hacking exercise for early 2022 to demonstrate
the effectiveness of tactical improvements
made and identify areas for further
improvement (see tactical recommendation 1.5
in Section 4.2). The HSE’s interim CISO should
schedule a red team for Q1 2022 to simulate a
human-operated ransomware attack from end-toend, to identify whether improvements have been
effective, and to identify additional priority and
focus areas for cybersecurity improvements. This
should be scheduled in addition to the recorded
plans within the Q2 DRR, which recorded an
‘action control’ to enhance penetration testing
and red team exercises with a due date of 31
December 2021.174

11. FA1.KR11 Implement the following tactical
recommendations identified through
this review, within the mobilised tactical
cybersecurity improvement programme (see
key recommendation F1.KR7) (see tactical
recommendation 1.5 in Section 4.2):
a. Improve security monitoring capability
i.

Document a process for how to respond
to cybersecurity alerts, that clearly outlines
how alerts should be triaged, investigated,
contained and responded to. This process
should also include coordinating the
response to security alerts and incidents
raised by any organisations connected to
the NHN.

ii. Augment the Security Operations team
with cybersecurity expertise.
b. Secure privileged access
i.

Develop and implement a robust
privileged access strategy that aligns
with Microsoft good practice and reduces
the risk of privileged accounts being
compromised.

c. Build a vulnerability management capability
i.

Stand up a vulnerability management
capability that continuously scans for
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by
attackers.

d. Harden the security boundary
i.

Define and communicate a ‘security
boundary’ for the HSE to provide a clear
boundary of cybersecurity responsibilities.

ii. Perform hardening activities on the
defined perimeter of the HSE.
iii. Identify secure methods for clinical staff in
voluntary hospitals to access applications
hosted by the HSE.
iv. Use security testing to validate that
the HSE can not be compromised by
malicious activity from outside its security
boundary.

e. Improve governance over the NHN
i.

Risk assess the ‘flat’ network design and
implement segmentation controls that
align to the defined level of risk appetite.

ii. Establish clear responsibilities for IT
and cybersecurity across all parties that
connect to the NHN, or share health data,
or access shared health services.
iii. Increase the resourcing of first and second
line network teams in line with defined
security responsibilities.
iv. Define a security code of connection for
connecting to the NHN.
v. Define a minimum security standard for
the networking of medical devices.
f.

Improve preparedness for a ransomware
attack
i.

Collect, organise and document artefacts
created as part of the response and
recovery to the ransomware cyber attack.

ii. Identify documents required to respond
to a ransomware attack (e.g., network
diagrams, asset list) and secure these in
a cloud repository. This should be aligned
with work to develop an IT continuity and
recoverability process which was recorded
in the Q2 DRR as an ‘action control’ with a
due date of 30 September 2021.175
iii. Setup and test out-of-band
communication medium that would
enable IT and security teams, as well as
employees, to communicate in the event
of a cybersecurity incident.
iv. Ensure that the HSE has a fit-forpurpose incident response service with
complementing and embedded internal
processes for its invocation.
v. Review backups and plan for a widespread failure recovery mode.
vi. Document a prioritised list of applications
for recovery.

g. Accelerate foundational IT projects
i.

Accelerate the move to cloud based email
by prioritising the resources
available for IT and cybersecurity
improvements programmes.

ii. Prioritise the remediation of critical
legacy systems. Particular attention
should be paid to the NIMIS application
to understand whether the configuration
changes made in one hospital (Hospital
A) to enable the application to run
on Windows 10 can be more widely
implemented to expedite the central
Windows 10 rollout plans. It should be
noted that a legacy risk was recorded
in the Q2 DRR, with an aligned ‘action
controls’ to risk assess the existing estate
and increase investment for replacing
outdated structures both with due dates of
31 December 2021.176
iii. Define a minimum standard for legacy
operating systems. For systems that
must run on outdated operating systems,
sufficient mitigation measures must be
defined.
iv. Define minimum standard requirements for
OS of medical devices.
v. Perform asset discovery activities to
continually update asset lists.

Medium-term recommendations
1. FA1.KR12 Appoint suitable long-term senior
leadership for cybersecurity (a CISO) and
establish a suitably resourced and skilled
central cybersecurity function (see strategic
recommendation 3.1 in Section 4.1). The
CISO should be at National Director level, a
direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate
access to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure
that cybersecurity risks are understood and
considered in all decision-making. They should
be empowered to execute on a defined security
vision, strategy and transformation to achieve
sustainable cybersecurity risk reduction across
the HSE. In line with this appointment the
cybersecurity governance and operating model
should be defined and subsequently resourced
(ideally with burst capacity resources used during
any interim periods that occur while recruitment
takes place). This model should align to the
three line of defence model. Responsibilities,

accountabilities, reporting lines and resourcing
across the extended organisation of the HSE
must all be defined. This includes within the
HSE’s cybersecurity and IT teams and between
these central teams and those within its extended
organisation.

longer term strategic activities. Within the
tactical track each activity should be defined
as being achievable within either ‘two-week
agile sprints’ or ‘60-days work packages’,
to deliver rapid risk reduction by addressing
exposure to specific attack techniques.
Once the cybersecurity transformation
programme is operational this track should
absorb the tactical cybersecurity improvement
programme.

2. FA1.KR13 Deliver a multi-year cybersecurity
transformation programme to build defence in
depth over time and address root-cause issues
(see strategic recommendation 3.2 in Section
4.1). Investment is needed in a single programme
of work delivered over the next two - four years
to develop core cybersecurity capabilities in a
sustainable manner over the short, mid and long
term. We would propose this transformation
is structured according to a two-track delivery
model with dedicated resources and defined
target states:
a. Tactical track - the HSE should bring
together red team experts and cybersecurity
engineers to identify pragmatic fixes to the
vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified.
These should then be triaged between this
tactical track and the strategic track for any

b. Strategic track - To build the sustainable and
enabling foundations that deliver long-term
reduction and mitigation of cyber risk, the
HSE should define strategic work packages
for activities that will take longer than 60 days
to implement. This will include the medium
recommendations made in this report.
For improvements that are identified to be
delivered strategically, suitable mitigations
should be put in place in the short-term to
reduce risk.
It would be typical for tactical and strategic track
work packages to be defined across topics/work
streams such as those shown in Figure 12:

Figure 12: Overview of key pillars in a cybersecurity transformation. This identifies elements that should be
considered when scoping a cybersecurity transformation programme

For example, within the ‘IT Foundations’ work
stream tactical work packages might include the
remediation of stale data or extending the scope of
the identity directory. Strategic work packages within
this work stream could include decommissioning
end of life systems or implementing an operational
CMDB to maintain an updated list of all systems and
applications in the environment.
3. FA1.KR14 Plan the HSE’s future IT
transformation that reduces cybersecurity risk
(see strategic recommendation 2.2 in Section
4.1). The HSE’s IT transformation lead should
begin documenting and planning the future IT
transformation. Executing an IT transformation will
allow the HSE to sustainably reduce cybersecurity
risk in the long-term, as issues within the legacy
IT estate can be addressed,and cybersecurity and
resilience can be built into the IT architecture.
4. FA1.KR15 Design and implement a single and
centralised security monitoring capability
for the defined security boundary of the HSE
that reports into the CISO (see strategic
recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1). This
should be for all monitoring aspects including
network, server and workstation environments,
as well as services such as email. Any reduction
in the visibility of assets for monitoring should be
risk-assessed to ensure that the HSE’s ability to
monitor its full environment is within risk appetite.
This implementation should involve establishing
the following across the three fundamental pillars
of people, process and technology:
•

People - Employing security monitoring and
detection SMEs (either internally or through third
parties) that are trained to identify and respond
to threats detected within and across the HSE
security boundary.

•

Process - Ensuring that detection and response
processes are documented. This includes incident
playbooks that outline the step-by-step response
actions to be taken, as well as documented
responsibilities and accountabilities for reporting
security events between organisations (such as
voluntary hospitals and reporting bodies like the
NCSC).

•

Tooling - Deployment of modern endpoint
detection and response tooling/endpoint
protection platform tooling across the HSE
environment and security boundary. This should
be in addition to the implementation of a Security
Incident and Event Manager (“SIEM”) and
Security Operations Centre (“SOC”) to centrally
analyse logs from systems and security tools.

64 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

Focus area 1 conclusion
The HSE was not sufficiently prepared to defend
against or respond to a ransomware cyber attack.
The HSE did not have sufficient subject matter
expertise, resources or appropriate security tooling
to detect, prevent or respond to a cyber attack of this
scale and complexity. As a result, the attacker was
able to enter the HSE environment and move around
with relative ease and there were several missed
opportunities to detect malicious activity, prior to the
detonation phase of the ransomware.
Following the execution of ransomware, the HSE
mobilised a response to overcome the significant
challenges posed by both the attack and its lack of
preparedness. Due to the scale and impact of the
ransomware, paired with the complex and legacy IT
environment, the technical recovery of IT systems
was challenging. The timeframe for recovery could
have been significantly longer had the decryption
key not been sourced, as the HSE would have had
to rely on recovering applications and systems from
backups. The HSE would likely have encountered
significant difficulties with this approach as the
backup infrastructure was primarily designed to
recover single systems only and not to recover
multiple systems at scale and pace.
The focus of the HSE’s activities since the attack has
been on implementing recommendations provided
by third parties and to continue to recover systems.
A finalised cybersecurity improvement plan does not
exist and limited evidence has been provided to show
planning that will significantly and sustainably reduce
the HSE’s exposure to future ransomware attacks.

In reviewing the organisation-wide preparedness and
strategic response, we have incorporated guidelines
and principles from ISO 22301:2019 ‘Security and
resilience - Business continuity management systems
(BCMS) - requirements’, BS 11200:2014 ‘Crisis
Management. Guidance and good practice’ and PD
CEN/TS 17091:2018 ‘Crisis management - Guidance
for developing a strategic capability.

ISO 22301 defines business continuity as ‘the
capability of an organisation to continue the delivery
of products and services within acceptable time
frames at predefined capacity during a disruption’.177
In the context of the HSE, the term clinical and
services continuity is used throughout this section
of the report. It refers to all acute and community
services, as well as corporate services, including, but
not limited to HR, procurement, finance, training, ICT
etc.

The European Technical specification for Crisis
Management, PD CEN/TS 17091:2018 specifies
that organisations should be prepared for an
‘unprecedented or extraordinary event or situation
that threatens an organization and requires a
strategic, adaptive, and timely response in order
to preserve its viability and integrity, with clear,
universally understood structures, roles and
responsibilities’.178 It defines crisis management
as ‘the developed capability of an organization
to prepare for, anticipate, respond to and recover
from crises’179 and states that an organisation’s
crisis management capability is not normally part
of routine organisational management, and should
be consciously and deliberately built and sustained
through capital, resource and time investment.
The findings and recommendations in this section
are mapped against the key thematic areas derived
from these standards (see section 2.4 - Our review
approach). The findings and recommendations follow
a numbering convention of FA2.KFX (Focus Area
2: Key Finding X) and FA2.KRX (Focus Area 2: Key
Recommendation X).

Crisis Preparedness

Area 1: Governance
over crisis and clinical
and services continuity
management in the HSE
and across HGs and CHOs
Introduction and Context
The HSE has shown itself to be well versed and
proficient in major emergency management, a
capability that has been demonstrated through its
response to several recent events, most notably the
2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the 2019 nurses’
strike. The integration of the Major Emergency
Management Framework with the wider national
emergency management capability enables a
comprehensive approach to plan for, to respond and
to coordinate recovery from major emergencies which
threaten persons or infrastructure at a national as well
as local level.
178
179
180
181
182

The organisation’s approach to incident and
emergency management is detailed in the following
preparation documents:
•

A Framework for Major Emergency Management;

•

Area Emergency Management Plans;

•

Hospital Major Emergency Plans;

•

Emergency Management Operational Delivery
Plan; and

•

Incident Management Framework.

FA2.KF1 Crisis management and clinical and
services continuity were not integrated within an
overarching Operational Resilience Programme,
leading to siloed work streams and capabilities
There was little active integration between clinical and
services continuity, crisis management and the other
closely aligned disciplines to ensure they directly
informed planning and that preparedness evolved to
prevailing conditions. The HSE is a large and diverse
organisation with complex operational structures.
Initiatives to achieve greater integration of resilience
disciplines were proposed in September 2019, when
an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) programme
was discussed at the Board meeting.180 Following this
Review the HSE’s new CEO and Board and Audit and
Risk Committee led a programme of work to further
develop the corporate governance of risk. This
included greater oversight at Board and ARC level for
corporate risks, significant reviews of the Corporate
Risk Register led by the EMT, work undertaken
between the Board and the EMT to improve the
risk management process, the establishment of
a Corporate Risk Support Team and increased
investment provided in the 2021 National Service
Plan to strengthen the corporate level risk team.
A subsequent review of the HSE’s corporate services
commenced in December 2019,181 ultimately led
to the proposal that a new role at National Director
level would be established with responsibility for
Governance and Risk (“ND G&R”). Responsibilities
include the development of risk and business
continuity management frameworks through which
risk management and clinical and service continuity
plans will be reviewed, maintained and validated.
Responsibility for clinical and service continuity under
the HSE’s accountability structure will remain with
operational and functional managers.182 Resilience

was also highlighted as a priority at the Performance
and Delivery Committee meeting in June of 2021.183

The HSE should:
•

Nominate an executive with responsibility for
operational resilience which will include the
coordination of component parts of crisis
management (including major emergency
management), incident management, clinical
and services continuity and enterprise risk
management;

•

Establish a HSE Resilience SteerCo to oversee
the design and delivery of an Operational
Resilience Programme, reporting into the
Board. This SteerCo should include senior
representatives from the EMT who own the
respective resilience disciplines and related
functions (e.g. cyber security), and any additional
key clinical and services and operations
representatives.

Board oversight of the wider risk and resilience
capability is currently delivered through a number
of different committees, under the consolidated
oversight of the Audit & Risk Committee, as follows:
•

Clinical and services continuity (currently
described as business continuity) - Audit & Risk
Committee; and previously People & Culture
Committee until June 2020;

•

Incident management - Safety & Quality
Committee;

•

Enterprise risk management - oversight and
management - Audit and Risk Committee; and

•

Cyber security - Performance & Delivery
Committee.

The workstreams related to these risks often operated
in silos. Additionally, when risks were identified,
improvements to the HSE’s response capability were
not always informed by those risks. For example,
the Board received a detailed briefing in November
2020 on the emerging cyber threats faced by the HSE
and the increase of the ransomware risk to business
continuity.184,185 Nevertheless, the Cybersecurity and
Business Continuity risk ratings in the CRR remained
constant (at a ‘High’ rating of 16).186,187,188,189
Following the review of corporate services, the ND
G&R (equivalent to a Chief Risk Officer) reports
through the Chief Strategy Officer to the CEO, Audit &
Risk Committee and Board on risk management. In a
mature Operational Resilience Programme, we would
expect to see the separate, but related disciplines of
risk management, incident management, clinical and
services continuity and crisis management integrated
into a comprehensive resilience framework under the
coordination of a senior executive, usually a Chief
Risk Officer who has appropriate access to the EMT,
the CEO and the Board. The framework allows for
assurance over the operational capability that is being
delivered by relevant owners.
FA2.KR1.1 Establish governance and oversight
of an Operational Resilience Programme (see
strategic recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)

FA2.KR1.2 Establish an Operational Resilience
Policy and Programme scope, strategy and
structure (see strategic recommendation 4.1 in
Section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Define an overarching policy that incorporates
the above resilience disciplines. Clarify ownership
of the programme (for example, under the ND
G&R) and integration with existing policies. At a
minimum, the policy should include a statement
of leadership commitment, objectives and scope,
roles and responsibilities, reference to relevant
industry standards and an oversight regime;

•

Define the Operational Resilience Programme
scope, strategy and structure across the HSE and
funded entities. Define the types of incidents in
scope (e.g. physical, technological, people and
cyber incidents) and how to build and maintain
a capability to respond across the organisation.
Define the operating model or the capability in
terms of dedicated staff, reporting lines, roles
and responsibilities within ‘prepare’ and ‘respond
and recover.’ Specify which areas of the HSE
and funded entities are included and identify
accountable teams/individuals for delivering
specific components of the programme. Agree
the intended end state, the timetable to achieve
the objectives and the resources required;

•

Design consistent tools and templates to be
used by the HSE and to be cascaded down as
resources for funded entities. Assign responsible
leads to complete these tools and templates,
and develop documentation and capability at
operational sites.

FA2.KR1.3 Establish assurance over the
Operational Resilience Programme (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Develop programme reporting, including KPIs,
a method and timetable for review, and risk
management considerations. Ensure that
operational resilience is a standing agenda at
Board (or Board committee) meetings.

FA2.KR1.4 Embed the Operational Resilience
capability via training and exercising (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4)
The HSE should:
•

•

Ensure a commitment to maintain and test the
resultant capability by designing an HSE-wide
training and exercising programme. This includes
a structured programme for delivering knowledge
and skills training, and scenario-based exercises
to all relevant stakeholders across the HSE
and funded entities who have a role to play in
any serious or significant incident or crisis; as
well as additional training resources, validation
programmes and independent Internal Audit
review to the Board;
Ensure ND G&R and at least one Board member
has direct competency/experience in the area of
operational resilience.

clinical and services continuity are now consolidated
under the National Director for Governance and Risk
(see also finding FA2.KF1), a significant body of work
will be required to address this gap.
Due to the historic lack of governance and oversight
over clinical and services continuity across HGs
and the HSE funded entities, a fragmented and
unvalidated capability was also apparent across
individual hospitals and CHOs. There was no
evidence of Clinical and Services Continuity
Policies at any of the sample sites or of formalised
steering committees with documented roles and
responsibilities for the ongoing and continuous
maintenance of the local Clinical and Services
Continuity Management System. Senior members
of the HSE commented that there was insufficient
support and resources provided to HGs and CHOs to
ensure standardised and consistent approaches to
clinical and services continuity management at local
site level. While continuity of services is implied in
service level agreements with hospitals, there is no
specific requirement to demonstrate a clinical and
services continuity capability.191 Internal Audit scrutiny
of all organisations funded by the HSE is permitted
in the Audit and Risk Committees ToRs. However,
there was no evidence of any audit of the clinical and
services continuity capability in the HSE or funded
entities.192
FA2.KR2.1 Establish and document a formal
governance structure to oversee clinical and
services continuity in the HSE (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Update the existing Clinical and Services
Continuity Policy and present it to the Board
for review and approval. This should be nested
under the overarching Operational Resilience
Policy (see also recommendation FA2.KR1) and
clearly articulate the purpose, scope, applicability,
review frequency, authority, Clinical and Services
Continuity Management Framework, governance
and monitoring of the policy and programme;

•

Establish a programme of governance for clinical
and services continuity - incorporated under
the Operational Resilience Programme (see
recommendation FA2.KR1.1) - which provides a
central point of accountability for monitoring and
reporting on the implementation, maintenance
and validation of activities in line with policy
objectives. Formally document roles and
responsibilities, a Clinical and Services Continuity
Steering Committee and an organisational chart.

FA2.KF2 There was no effective governance or
consistent ownership of clinical and services
continuity across the HSE
There was no central Clinical and Services Continuity
Management System Framework in place in the HSE
prior to the cyber attack. Roles and responsibilities in
respect of the management and oversight of clinical
and services continuity were not documented, nor
were there any structured governance mechanisms
to implement, monitor and report progress on the
objectives contained in the 2016 Business Continuity
Policy.190 In the absence of this framework, clinical
and services continuity capability was not adequately
resourced or embedded. This was identified in the
review of the HSE’s corporate services, initiated in
2019; and while enterprise risk management and

The scope should reference the HSE and all
funded entities;
•

Formalise robust reviews and challenges by
appropriate personnel, of all stages of the Clinical
and Services Continuity Programme, embedding
Internal Audit into the clinical and services
continuity lifecycle to provide independent
assurance to the Board of the HSE’s contingency
capabilities;

•

Secure formal clinical and services continuity
qualifications for appropriate members of the
steering committee/implementation team;

•

Be prepared to consider the emerging
requirements contained in the EU Critical Entities
Resilience Directive (“CER”).

FA2.KR2.2 Support funded entities (hospital
groups, hospitals and CHOs) to establish
governance over clinical and services continuity
(see strategic recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)
The HSE should support funded entities (hospital
groups, hospitals and CHOs) to:
•

Implement Clinical and Services Continuity
Steering Sub-Committees at HG, hospital
and CHO levels, beneath the HSE Steering
Committee; and establish a framework of
governance. These groups should have a similar
structure, terms of reference and roles and
responsibilities as the overarching HSE group;

•

Draft specific Clinical and Services Continuity
Policies which complement the HSE’s policy,
according to the policy guidance listed above;

•

Appoint relevant clinical and services continuity
sponsors;

•

Integrate clinical and services continuity into
project and change management processes
where appropriate.

Area 2: Incident / crisis
management and clinical
and services continuity
planning at the HSE and
sample site hospitals and
CHOs
FA2.KF3 Clinical and Services Impact Analysis
did not consistently inform clinical and services
continuity workarounds
The Clinical and Services Impact Analysis193 (referred
to in standards as a Business Impact Analysis)
identifies critical processes, and the associated
people, premise, systems and infrastructure, which
must be maintained to ensure a minimum viable
organisation during an incident or crisis. Failure to
conduct a comprehensive Clinical and Services
Impact Analysis process hinders the development of
adequate workarounds to maintain critical operations.
Standardised or formalised Clinical and Services
Impact Analysis processes were not evident at HSE
centre, support services, or sample hospital and CHO
sites. Even those sample sites where the clinical and
services continuity posture was proactive and mature
(e.g. Site Workshop 11), a Clinical and Services Impact
Analysis had not been conducted. Some hospital and
CHO response teams reactively defined their recovery
priorities during the initial phase of the attack because
there was no Clinical and Services Impact Analysis.
This diverted effort from the response towards tasks
which should have been completed in advance of
the cyber attack, eg., defining a schedule of systems
for recovery based on pre-agreed Recovery Time
Objectives (“RTOs”) and Recovery Point Objectives
(“RPOs”). Several interviewees noted that in the
absence of a Clinical and Services Impact Analysis
the early prioritisation scheme was driven by the OES
list, before advancing to an approach that focused on
clinical risks,194 delaying the recovery of patient critical
services (see also finding FA2.KF17). The extent of the
initial disruption and maintenance of essential services
varied significantly across the sample sites. There
was also significant variance in the effectiveness and

ensure consistency of critical patient services.

FA2.KR3.1 Establish and embed a clear
and consistent approach to Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis across the HSE to
inform recovery prioritisation (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)
To ensure a standardised organisation-wide approach
to the Clinical and Services Impact Analysis process,
the Executive Sponsor for clinical and services
continuity at the HSE and each HG/hospital and CHO
should:
•

Establish and embed a formal Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis process, with clear
ownership at each level, including the criteria for
the “RTOs”195 and “RPOs”196;

•

Ensure the results of the Clinical and Services
Impact Analysis are formally reviewed and
approved on a periodic basis, by senior
management, and following any significant
systems/process, operational, regulatory or
personnel change.

FA2.KR3.2 Design clinical and services continuity
workarounds, based on the Clinical and Services
Impact Analysis, to enable the HSE to continue
providing critical services while responding to an
incident or crisis (see strategic recommendation
4.2 in Section 4)
The HSE should:
•

•

Design and agree clinical and services continuity
workarounds, for critical processes, with the
agility and governance to be maintained for a
prolonged period, and based on the Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis;
Assess all workarounds to ensure they do not
pose an unacceptable risk to patient care or to
the HSE through the transfer of data or other
assets between systems;

•

Align workarounds for similar systems or
processes across the HSE to improve their
effectiveness and inform a consistent response;

•

Reflect the workarounds in the relevant Clinical
and Services Continuity Plan.

the HSE
There is no framework or mechanism in place at the
HSE to ensure that the clinical and services continuity
planning is aligned to the policy objectives. No
integrated and comprehensive clinical and services
continuity planning exists at the HSE. Additionally,
while some hospitals had a level of clinical and
services continuity planning in place, there was
no evidence that this process was consistently
formalised or conducted across sampled HGs,
hospitals or CHOs, to deliver a local clinical and
services continuity capability.197 Where workarounds
were in place, there was inconsistency in emphasis,
layout and terminology and no evidence that the
determination, adoption and resourcing of those
workarounds had input or steer from the HSE
centrally.
The absence of pre-prepared Clinical and Services
Continuity Plans severely impacted the initial stages
of the response to the cyber attack, as resources
had to be diverted away from the response effort to
compile essential information, create structures and
prioritise services for recovery which should have
been formalised and articulated during a preparatory
phase.198, 199 Recurring examples given in interviews
of this were construction of call trees, compiling
asset registers, critical service prioritisation and
definition and use of alternative communications
methods. Furthermore, recovery solutions were often
inaccessible as hard copies were not available.
FA2.KR4 Develop and embed consistent Clinical
and Services Continuity Plans at strategic, tactical
and operational levels that align with the Clinical
and Services Impact Analysis (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4).

To ensure that Clinical and Services Continuity
Plans are compatible with the recovery objectives,
the HSE should:
•

Implement Clinical and Services Continuity Plans
at strategic, tactical and operational levels of the
HSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs and that they
formally document workarounds and the steps
involved to resume normal operations;

FA2.KF4 There was no standardised approach to
clinical and services continuity planning across

195 Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the period of time following an incident within which a product and service or an activity is
resumed or resources are recovered (ISO 22300:2021).
196 Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the point at which information used by an activity is restored to enable the activity to operate on
resumption (ISO 22300:2021)

•

Benchmark the Clinical and Services Continuity
Plan construction against ISO 22331, and ensure
they are compatible with future Sláintecare
objectives;200

•

Incorporate the testing of these steps into the
clinical and services continuity management
training and exercising schedule/programme (e.g.
through desktop walkthrough of the resumption
procedures to identify any gaps or unforeseen
dependencies);

•

Ensure soft and hard copies of Clinical and
Services Continuity Plans are available in
appropriate areas.

FA2.KF5 The HSE did not have an adequate
internal Crisis Management Framework or plans
to support the response to the Conti attack, nor
had they planned for severe but plausible total
loss scenarios
The Major Emergency Management and Incident
Management Frameworks (as well as interim
Emergency Management governance arrangements
published in 2020) have been invoked on multiple
occasions and delivered an agile and effective
response to short term surge demands on health
services.201,202
There is an inconsistent and interchangeable use
of the terms ‘major emergency management’ and
‘emergency management’ and ‘crisis management’.
Crisis planning throughout the HSE was focused on
the scenarios which would mobilise major emergency
management teams, such as adverse weather,
pandemic, epidemic, serious accidents and terrorist
action. There was no Crisis Management Plan in
place to guide the HSE’s response to an internal
crisis impacting the HSE itself, rather than an external
crisis such as COVID-19 or Storm Emma; nor has
it developed and exercised scenario-specific plans
for the response to severe disruption scenarios,
(e.g. total loss of premises, systems or people). A
fundamental assumption of these plans is that all
mission critical systems and infrastructure would
remain available to the response teams. The HSE has
not conducted any scenario planning for the total
loss of a facility, system, process or service (see also
finding FA2.KF21). While risks were noted on the
Corporate Risk Register (especially cyber security
and clinical and services continuity), there was limited
evidence to suggest the HSE undertakes subsequent
scenario planning to:
•

Identify potential triggers and escalators for the
worst, best and most likely scenarios per risk;

•

identify likely impacts;

•

undertake mitigating actions despite the fact that
cyber security and clinical and services continuity
were identified as strategic risks.

Such scenario-specific plans would outline the likely
impacts caused by highly plausible organisational
crises, as well as the key considerations, and
corresponding pre-agreed decisions to guide the
strategic response to those events.
FA2.KR5.1 Design an end-to-end Crisis
Management Framework (integrated with the
existing MEM and IM Frameworks) and overseen
by the HSE Resilience Steering Group (see finding
FA2.KR1.1 and strategic recommendation 4.2 in
Section 4)
The HSE should review the existing incident and
emergency management structures, and the
structures established during the attack and other
recent events (e.g. COVID-19), to establish a new
integrated end-to-end organisation-wide Crisis
Management Framework that is fit-for-purpose across
a wide variety of crisis types. This Framework should
incorporate all resilience disciplines responsible for
implementing organisational preparedness activities
(e.g. emergency/incident/crisis response, and
clinical and services continuity management), and
identify accountable teams/individuals for specific
components, as well as define all levels of response
required during an actual event at strategic, tactical
and operational levels. It should also integrate with
the relevant elements of the organisation-wide Major
Emergency Management and Incident Management
Frameworks.
The Framework should include the following
elements:
•

Hierarchy of teams required for response.
Typically this will include three layers operational, tactical and strategic - with
command and control escalating according to the
nature and severity of the incident;

•

Defined roles and responsibilities, and decision
making authority, for all those involved in the
identification, escalation, response to and
management of incidents;

•

Escalation thresholds and formalised
communication channels;

•

Guidance on how and when to invoke response
structure in line with the Incident Classification
and Severity Matrix (see also finding FA2.KF14);

•

Agreed touchpoints and interaction between the
HSE, and HGs and CHOs;

•

Tools and templates to be used by all responders
(across the HSE, HG and CHO levels) during an
incident (e.g., situation report, classification and
severity matrix, impact assessment, decision and
action logs).

FA2.KR5.2 Design a suite of crisis response
plans and procedures to underpin the Crisis
Management Framework (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4)
The HSE should design:
•

A Crisis Management Plan providing detailed
roles and responsibilities for key positions in the
NCMT and supporting tactical teams (e.g. HG/
hospital and CHO leadership), including checklists
of activities and considerations, and details of
third party support available;

•

A Technical/Operational Coordination Guide
providing the details of how the technical (e.g. IT
Ops) and operational teams (e.g. clinical response
teams) would coordinate and work together.
This includes detailed roles and responsibilities,
information flows, processes, checklists of key
activities and considerations and details of third
party support available;

•

•

•

Scenario-specific plans providing detailed stepby-step operational guides for specific scenarios
(e.g. analyst response to malware, fire response
plan). The HSE should, using the risks identified
in the Corporate Risk Register, conduct a threat
profile review and readiness assessment to
determine high likelihood, high impact scenarios
and create scenario-specific plans for response.
This should include severe but plausible total loss
scenarios;
Functional Response Plans providing detailed
function-specific guidance for non-technical
teams, for example a Legal/Regulatory Team and
Communications Team (see recommendation
FA2.KR7);
Site-Specific Response Plans templates and
guidance, providing resources for standardised
clinical and services continuity and crisis
management planning at sites across the
organisation.

Area 3: Crisis
communications
preparedness at the HSE
FA2.KF6 The HSE’s Internal Communications
Team was under resourced
Having only been established in 2019, the HSE’s
Internal Communications Team was not large
enough to coordinate communications to 130,000
staff203 members. Whilst investment in the External
Communications Team has increased to circa 76 full
time employees (FTE), the Internal Communications
Team consisted of circa six FTE.204 Stakeholders
noted that the Internal Communications Team had
struggled to deliver on their growth strategy because
immediate crises and operational requirements had
consistently diverted the attention of the team.205
FA2.KR6 Ensure that the resources assigned
to internal communications are sufficient (see
strategic recommendation 4.2 and tactical
recommendation 3.1 in Section 4).
An effective Internal Communications Team is critical
to disseminate information and guidance to all
130,000 HSE staff206 all operating across different
levels of the response; this requires additional
resources and staff to what is currently available.
As part of their future crisis management planning,
the HSE should assess the requirements of their
crisis response communications strategy and
allocate the resources necessary to grow the internal
communications team, to reflect the HSE’s current
operational architecture, and taking into consideration
the impacted and involved stakeholder base.
FA2.KF7 There was no documented HSE Crisis
Communications Plan in place; and the crisis
communications capability across HG/hospital
and CHOs was fragmented
The HSE’s external communications strategy in
response to the ransomware attack, whilst wellexecuted, was based on previous experience for the
organisation rather than a formally documented Crisis
Communications Plan. The combined experience of
the communications team, across multiple sectors
(including PR, journalism and crisis communications)
allowed them to create a governance structure for
their workstream by 08:00 on the day of the attack

and begin the process of integrating their response
with other response and local communications
teams.207 Whilst the absence of standardised plans
and processes did not impact their communications
response to this incident, these are important
documents to have when onboarding new joiners or
working in collaboration with other teams, to ensure
response activities are completed to a consistently
high standard.
The HSE’s national communications teams, and
the HG and CHO communications teams operate
under separate governance structures. Whilst the
HSE’s national communications teams have a well
established communications network, developed
through weekly meetings during the COVID-19
pandemic, the local communications teams have
varying levels of experience and available resources.
The absence of a consistent communications
strategy across HGs and CHOs resulted in different
messages being conveyed to patients; some were
told to come in unless told otherwise whilst others
were told to stay at home unless explicitly told to
come into the hospital. This disparity in experience
and subsequent strategy has been flagged in the
Corporate Risk Register since February 2020 under
the risk of damage to the HSE’s ‘Organisational
reputation’, with a corresponding action to ‘enhance
communications functions in new Regional Health
Areas’.208
FA2.KR7 Document the Communications Team’s
existing response structures, processes, tools and
templates in a Crisis Communications Plan (see
tactical recommendation 3.1 in section 4)
The HSE should document a formal Crisis
Communications Plan to ensure consistent and
efficient communications management across
the organisation during an incident/crisis, and to
guide the actions of new members of the HSE’s
Communications Team.
•

The Communications Team should document the
response processes, tools and templates, and
structures they have found most effective during
previous incidents, ensuring the resulting plan
dovetails into any existing Major Emergency and
Crisis Management Plans and processes, in line
with the Crisis Management Framework (see also
finding FA2.KF5);

Communications Plans in place at the HGs and
CHOs to ensure the structures and processes
involved integrate effectively;
•

Once finalised, all processes and templates,
especially those requiring collaboration with other
HSE teams, should be socialised and ratified to
ensure they are fit for purpose and based on upto-date information;

•

The Crisis Communications Plan should be
reviewed regularly to confirm the content is still
correct and relevant, and to incorporate any
lessons learnt from new incidents.

Area 4: Awareness,
training and exercising
capability at the HSE, HG/
hospitals and CHOs
FA2.KF8 Awareness, training and exercising
of the crisis management and clinical and
services continuity capabilities were not formally
embedded across HSE
Various emergency management exercises have been
held across the HSE, covering responses to several
scenarios such as extreme weather and exposure to
infectious diseases. There was also evidence of more
advanced training and exercising capabilities in place
at some HGs and CHOs.209, 210 However, there was
no evidence of a HSE-wide training and exercising
programme to ensure the right people, at the right
levels, were trained in their functions, roles and
responsibilities in a crisis.211, 212 For example, there
was isolated but limited evidence that staff involved
in the Conti response had received training on the
HSE’s clinical and services continuity capability,
priorities and plans prior to the crisis.
We found no evidence of strategic level exercises
(delivered to its National Crisis Management Team),
rehearsing the response to a clinical and services
continuity event or crisis impacting the HSE only,
e.g. the loss or denial of critical HSE systems or
infrastructure, or a significant reputational issue.
Additionally, while the HSE has participated in
national multi agency major emergency exercises,
they have not conducted any multi-team crisis
desktop or simulation exercises in conjunction with

key sites to simulate loss/denial scenarios of critical
infrastructure. There was also a lack of evidence to
show how the risks identified in the Corporate Risk
Register informed the design of plausible scenariobased exercises.213, 214, 215
Whilst there were pockets of good practice across
the organisation where local entities deliver frequent
emergency management exercises, there was no
evidence that the clinical and service continuity
exercises delivered followed a standard approach
or aligned to best practice design as outlined in
industry standards. The absence of a comprehensive
approach to integrated crisis management training
and validation across the organisation has resulted
in the following findings, evidenced in a sample of
hospitals:
•

•

Plans did not capture challenges which could
have been identified during a rigorous validation
process; for example, the unavailability of hard
copies of Clinical and Services Continuity plans,
an inability to install WiFi post attack, absence
of call trees and no alternative communications
plan;216
The absence of well-articulated roles,
responsibilities and crisis management structure
(e.g. local level responders were unsure of their
roles and the structures in place);217

•

No clear decision making authority, including
delegated decision making to HGs/hospitals
and CHOs, that is clear to the National Crisis
Management Team and executives, as well as
supporting teams and structures218;

•

No Crisis Communications Plan or recognition for
the need of a HSE-wide internal alert system or
alternative communications channels219 to allow
cascading information between the HSE, CHOs
and HGs;

•

At the time of the cyber attack, there was no
expertise in the HSE on how to stand up an
integrated coordination centre. The HSE therefore
initially relied on significant third party assistance
and then the Defence Forces to establish
a SITCEN and the templates and protocols
necessary to achieve an integrated command
centre (see also finding FA2.KF15).220

220

FA2.KR8.1 Establish a formal training and
exercising programme in support of the
Operational Resilience Programme (see also
Finding FA2.KF1 and strategic recommendation
4.2 in section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Ensure this programme incorporates clinical
and services continuity and crisis management
requirements and that all relevant individuals and
teams involved at every level of the HSE become
familiar with their roles and responsibilities in a
crisis or significant clinical and services continuity
incident;

•

Ensure it is aligned to ISO 22398 Security and
resilience - Guidelines for exercising and testing.
Define and implement standard training and
exercising templates which articulate scope,
objectives, assumptions, results, issues log and
lessons learned.

FA2.KR8.2 Deliver training to staff in key
responsible and supporting roles, and new
managers (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in
section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Provide clinical and services continuity and crisis
management training for staff in key responsible
and supporting roles. Such staff should have
knowledge of best practice in relation to each
core element of an effective integrated command
centre and of an effective Clinical and Services
Continuity Management Programme including:
risk assessment, Clinical and Services Impact
Analysis, clinical and services continuity
management strategy selection, plan testing
techniques and processes for assessing
effectiveness of plans;

•

Include clinical and services continuity awareness
training for new managers.

FA2.KR8.3 Conduct annual exercises to rehearse
the operational resilience capability (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Conduct annual crisis management and clinical
and services continuity desktop or simulation

exercises with the NCMT and ensure scenarios
extend beyond current focus to include other loss
scenarios including loss/denial of mission critical
infrastructure, unavailability of key persons,
systems, processes and facilities;
•

Conduct annual multi-team crisis management
and clinical and services exercises involving key
HSE functions (e.g. support services) and funded
entities; increasing in complexity over time to
continually build organisation-wide maturity and
capability;

•

Support the nominated responsible owner with
responsibility for clinical and services continuity
and crisis management to acquire relevant
external training to maintain the currency of their
expertise.

Area 5: Implementation of
lessons learned
FA2.KF9 While there was a formal overarching
post-incident review process and evidence of
localised ‘lessons learned’ programmes, the
process and outcomes were not consistently
applied
The HSE Incident Management Framework outlines
a process for conducting a post-incident review,
followed by improvement planning and monitoring.221
Whilst the HSE have not previously encountered an
incident of this scale, they have been exposed to
other significant incidents (COVID-19, nurses strike
and WannaCry) over the last five years, each of which
would have highlighted key learnings for improved
crisis management maturity at localised level.
One example of lessons learned being incorporated,
and a recurring theme from interviews222, is that the
NCMT meeting process, which was developed during
the COVID-19 pandemic, was quickly adapted to
respond to the Conti ransomware attack. This was
demonstrated by the speed with which the NCMT
first convened at 08:30 on 14 May and the clear
governance and administrative structures put around
their response activities.223, 224 Another example is
that, with communications platforms unavailable
across the HSE, the Internal Communications
Team were still able to publish information to the
HSE website; this was due to a previous decision

221
222
223
224
225
226
227

to reduce the website’s dependency on the HSE
infrastructure, based on lessons learned from
previous IT disruptions.225
At the hospital and CHO level, several sample
sites had proactively conducted after action
assessments226 of the response to clinical and
services continuity events and applied these in a
lessons learned programme. Notable examples of this
were CUH with comprehensive post event analysis
of Storm Emma and laboratory outages. Moreover,
examples of populated lessons learned spreadsheets
were shared, illustrating that a wider awareness about
the importance of a lessons learned process is in
place.227
However, there is insufficient overarching governance
and process to ensure that lessons from incident and
major emergency response are not just identified, but
assigned ownership, addressed, and disseminated to
inform structural improvements across the HSE and
funded entities. Specifically, where individual reviews
were conducted, there was a lack of evidence
indicating lessons learned were shared more broadly
with other areas of the HSE, and with HGs and
CHOs. Actions for implementing lessons learned do
not appear to have been assigned owners to ensure
they are completed, indicating that while lessons
may be identified, they do not systematically lead to
improvement or change.
FA2.KR9 Review and refine the post-incident
review process to ensure ongoing and continuous
improvement of the response capability (see
strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)
Formal and consistent post-incident reviews should
be conducted following all incidents or near misses
to capture both areas of positive performance and
opportunities for improvement. The Operational
Resilience Steering Group should ensure that all
post incident reviews are reported centrally to enable
learnings to be disseminated across the HSE and
funded entities (see also finding FA2.KF1). Mitigating
actions should be assigned a responsible owner
and tracked centrally until their completion. The
process should be reflected in the end-to-end Crisis
Management Framework (see also recommendation
FA2.KR5.1).

Area 6: Human factors
and cultural contributors
FA2.KF10 Emergency response was ingrained in
the HSE’s core operations; HSE staff had a natural
ability to respond to emergencies, despite a lack
of organisational preparedness
At the time of the cyber attack the HSE was over
a year into a multifaceted and prolonged crisis
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All workshop
participants stated that staff from all levels across
the HSE, impacted hospitals, CHOs and third parties
went above and beyond to support the cyber attack
response effort.228,229,230,231
In times of significant challenge or emergencies staff
across the health service are able to demonstrate
resilience, and exhibit efficient and quick decision
making grounded in organisational values (e.g.
prioritisation of patient service and care). A prevalent
theme in interviews is that the staff are ‘perpetually
responding to emergencies’232, 233, 234, and are
therefore naturally skilled at it.
However, the significant majority of individuals
interviewed also clearly stated that the HSE was not
prepared to manage an event of this magnitude and
scale.235 Clinical and services continuity and crisis
preparedness, as opposed to emergency response,
was not evidenced as a corporate priority in the
HSE. Interviewees commonly commented that a
reactive posture to crisis had largely been normalised
and accepted day-to-day practice.236 The apparent
normalisation of crises had led to a predominantly
reactive posture towards crisis response, a
confidence in the HSE’s crisis management capability,
and a reduced perceived need for significant advance
preparation for wider incidents, organisational crisis
or ‘black swan’ events.
The leadership style and decision-making process
required during a crisis is necessarily different than
that required during business as usual, even within
high tempo, safety critical operations such as health
care. Crises are associated with heightened stress

228
229
230
231
232
233
234
235
236
237
238

that impacts on the decision-making process, which
is made more complex by the constraints of time,
the volume of decisions to be made and the scarcity
of available information. For example, decisions
had to be made in the response to the Conti attack
where supporting data was not available and where
IT and clinical priorities were not understood or
aligned (e.g. the decision to disconnect appliances
from the network, made in the absence of a clinical
and services impact analysis outlining the critical
systems, the impacts to be caused, and service level
agreements for recovery).
The consequence of being in perpetual ‘crisis
response’ mode can also create wellbeing impacts on
staff members, as illustrated in this case by the level
of stress and fatigue experienced by staff members
dealing with both the COVID-19 and concurrent cyber
attack crises.237 Chronic stress without recovery,
depletes energy reserves, leads to burnout and
ultimately compromises the crisis response capability.
This can subsequently compound the inability to act
and lead clearly, and therefore has the potential to
further increase the risk of patient safety incidents
and clinical errors as well as further risk of harm
to staff. Staff who had been deployed during the
COVID-19 pandemic reported returning to their roles
feeling fatigued before the ransomware attack; the
concurrent crises were unlike anything they had ever
encountered and the response was heavily fuelled by
staff members’ ‘can-do attitude’.238
FA2.KR10 Instil a culture of preparedness in the
HSE to reduce the negative impacts of disruption
on its people (see strategic recommendation 4.2
in section 4)
The HSE should aim to create a culture that values
and emphasises crisis preparedness as well as
having confidence in natural ability to respond to
major emergencies. In addition to scenario-specific
plans to prepare for crisis scenarios (beyond the
current scope of floods, adverse weather and aviation
disasters) recommended below (see also findings
FA2.KF8 and FA2.KF21), the HSE should implement
a comprehensive training and exercising programme
to familiarise all crisis responders at operational (e.g.
hospital/CHO, business support services, IT Security,

etc.), tactical (e.g. HSE, regional/area CMTs), and
strategic (e.g. HSE NCMT) levels with their roles
and responsibilities for crisis preparedness and
response, as well as the unique key considerations
and decisions required in various crisis scenarios
(see also finding FA2.KF8). Conducting scenariobased desktop and simulation exercises will expose
individuals to the (simulated) pressures they will
experience, thereby reducing the negative impact
imposed by external stressors and uncertainty in
real life events. Transferring the skills gained in
psychologically realistic exercises will facilitate more
effective teamwork and decision making in actual
crisis situations when they occur.

Crisis Response

Area 7: Notification
and activation of NCMT
and wider response
workstreams
FA2.KF11 Core senior responders were notified
and the NCMT invoked quickly; however, the
notification of staff and wider stakeholders was ad
hoc and did not follow a pre-planned notification
process or channel
Core senior responders were notified quickly using
best endeavours via phone on the morning of the
attack, and the first NCMT meeting was held at
08:30 on the day of the Incident.239 An initial ‘blast’
notification was also issued to HSE mobile devices at
14:00240 via Vodafone and Three network providers241,
in an effort to inform wider HSE staff of the Incident.
However, there was no evidence to show this
process was formally prescribed and embedded
in the Incident Management Framework,242 Major
Emergency Framework243 or a Crisis Communications
Plan, nor was it aligned to an incident severity matrix
to ensure the correct level of response was activated
and involved (see also finding FA2.KF14). It was noted
during interviews with several stakeholders, and in
the Lessons Learned Log that receipt of the initial
notification text was ad hoc and did not reach all HSE
staff members and contractors.244, 245, 246 This was in

239

241
242
243

247

part because the recipient list did not include staff
members or contractors on non-HSE devices.
Interviewees noted that as a result of the ad hoc
notification process, some staff members and
contractors first heard of the attack on the local news,
or by experiencing the effects of the ransomware
attack first hand. Others received multiple notices
from various parties (including impacted hospitals)
and through multiple channels, while some never
received an initial notification.247
FA2.KR11 Design and implement an integrated
notification and escalation process and acquire
a means of mass notification to all HSE staff and
contractors (see tactical recommendation 3.1 in
section 4)
The HSE should implement a uniform and integrated
notification and escalation process within the
updated end-to-end response framework, supported
by an Incident Classification and Severity Matrix
and an ‘Activation Membership’ list detailing the
stakeholders to be informed, across all levels of
response, depending on the severity rating of that
incident. This will allow critical responders to be
notified of an event and convene at pace to instigate
a response at the appropriate level to any incident or
crisis impacting its operations or services.
The HSE should review whether the use of mobile
phone network providers as a method of sending
‘blast notifications’ meets the required functionality
for mass notification and, if not, should consider
investing in a mass emergency notification and
communications tool to improve its wider incident
notification capability. The solution should include
features for notifying all HSE staff members and
contractors or smaller groups of staff about any
serious incident, crisis or clinical and services
continuity event (e.g., a data leak where formal
notification and information needs to be disclosed
with impacted persons, physical or medical events
requiring safety instructions to be issued, or a total
system outage/ransomware attack). Clear authority
should be designated to an individual or individuals
with an appropriate level of authority to send
communications from this platform, to ensure all
messages are consistent and have been signed off by
the appropriate parties (e.g. legal).

Area 8: Response
structures, resourcing and
logistics
FA2.KF12 The HSE did not follow a pre-defined
and consistent crisis management structure in the
initial phase of the response
Although the HSE ultimately established an effective
crisis management structure during their response to
the ransomware attack, it was designed reactively to
apply to this specific incident.
The first NCMT meeting was convened less than
four hours after the IT Critical Incident Process was
invoked,248 in part due to the familiarity of operating
NCMT established during the COVID-19 response.249
While invocation was prompt, several stakeholders
noted that the initial supporting structures feeding
into the NCMT were inconsistent and at times
conflicted.250 Both the Regional CMTs251 and the Area
CMTs252 were initially stood up based on different
documentation, and subsequently stood down when
alternate response governance structures, linking
directly to the HGs and CHOs, were agreed.
Technology-focused response and recovery
workstreams were established in parallel to the CMTs
but were not reflected in any of the initial Emergency
Response or Incident Management documentation.
Additionally, a clinical and integrated governance
structure (which later became the integrated clinical
and operational risk subgroup of the NCMT) was set
up to capture risks, guide the operational response
based on clinical priority, and in an effort to establish
clear communications between clinical operations
and IT. This was a critical group that ultimately
influenced the prioritisation of the recovery of the IT
systems to enable the resumption of clinical services
Stakeholders noted that the legal workstream had
not been considered as a required workstream
for an emergency or incident response prior to
the attack. Finally, it was identified in the Lessons
Learned Programme Log that central reporting
was difficult due to the way individual workstreams
were established in silos and without clear central
guidance (see also finding FA2.KF18).253

253
254
255

The lack of integrated programme management
was recognised as a risk by the HSE five days into
the response.254 This led to a request for assistance
from the Defence Forces who established defined
information management processes which were
‘scalable and agile’255 and could cope with the
complexity of a cyber crisis. Stakeholders interviewed
noted a recurring sentiment that the Defence Forces’
intervention was critical in allowing the HSE to
establish tighter governance, better communication
flows and create mental space for responders to
focus on remediation and recovery activities.256, 257
FA2.KR12 Establish a Crisis Situation Centre to
manage an organisation-wide response to a crisis
(see recommendation FA2.KR5.1 and strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4)
As part of the Crisis Management Framework (see
recommendation FA2.KR5.1), the HSE should
establish a Crisis Situation Centre construct to
be stood up during a crisis response. This should
incorporate the learnings from the Situation
Centre introduced by the Defence Forces during
the Conti response and include the following
elements:Guidance on how and when it should be
invoked in line with the Incident Classification and
Severity Matrix (see also recommendation FA2.KR14);
•

Guidance on how and when it should be invoked
in line with the Incident Classification and Severity
Matrix (see also recommendation FA2.KR14);

•

The hierarchy of teams required;

•

Roles and responsibilities and delineated decision
authority of each response level;

•

Escalation thresholds and formalised
communication channels;

•

Agreed touchpoints and interaction between the
Situation Centre and HGs and CHOs;

•

Tools and templates to be used by all responders
(across the HSE, HG and CHO levels) during an
incident (e.g., situation report, classification and
severity matrix, impact assessment, decision and
action logs).

FA2.KF13 There was lack of oversight and
structure to the coordination and integration of
third party support
The HSE recognised the need for additional resources
and specialist skills and engaged third parties for
incident response,258, 259 legal and forensics support
early on. The impact of the Incident on a national
scale encouraged goodwill from third party support
and vendors, including the provision of pro bono
work. The HSE was aware of the reliance they were
placing on third parties and set objectives for each, to
ensure they did not undertake activities beyond the
required time period. The HSE also took ownership
of tasks when sufficient progress was made and the
internal resources became available.
It was noted in interviews that a significant amount
of time was spent onboarding and integrating
third parties, particularly educating them on the
intricacies of the health sector and for example,
differences between voluntary and statutory
hospitals.260 Stakeholders also noted that data
gathering activities were duplicated because HSE
staff did not have visibility of third party activity or
miscommunication between third parties and internal
teams. This diverted focus from other efforts during
the critical early stages of the response. The visual
representation of each team’s priorities at CityWest
several days into the response addressed some of
these issues, as it allowed responders to deconflict
their activities and re-engineer their approach where
required.
FA2.KR13 Establish formal retainers with key third
parties that may be required to support a crisis
response (see tactical recommendation 3.3 in
Section 4)
The HSE should consider the third party support
that may be required during an incident, including:
crisis response, external legal counsel and public
relations. These retainers should include service
level agreements, clear descriptions of third party
roles and responsibilities, and pre-agreed legal
requirements (such as non-disclosure agreements) to
ensure partners can be engaged to support, and be
integrated into, a response immediately and scale to
the size of the response required.

258
259
260
261
262

Work should be conducted with third parties
providing technical support to familiarise them with
the HSE’s IT network, architecture and systems, to
facilitate quicker engagement during an incident.
The role of retained third parties should be reflected
in response plans or playbooks and they should be
involved in regular cross-organisation conversations
and training exercises with the HSE, the HGs
and CHOs to rehearse efficient coordination and
communication flows.

Area 9: Information and
data management in a
crisis
FA2.KF14 The initial impact assessment was
hindered due to the absence of an HSE-wide
incident severity matrix
There was no integrated HSE-wide Incident
Classification and Severity Matrix to guide the initial
impact assessment following the attack. The ‘HSE
Risk Impact Table’ in the HSE Incident Management
Framework lists five impact levels from Negligible to
Extreme across eight different categories.261 While
those categories reflect a spectrum of operational,
financial, compliance and reputational impacts, there
was no evidence to indicate that the initial impact
assessment conducted during the ransomware attack
was based on this guidance and subsequently used
to inform decisions made and actions taken. There
was also no evidence provided of an Incident Severity
Matrix for IT or cyber incidents, specifically.
The Managing a Major Incident document is designed
to be used in a ‘critical’ incident that attracts ‘more
attention or has a greater impact than “normal” critical
incidents’; 262 however, there were no associated
definitions for those thresholds. It was also unclear
how the impact assessment from an IT incident
would be aligned with that of the ‘HSE Risk Impact
Table’. In the absence of an integrated HSE-wide
Incident Classification and Severity Matrix (see also
finding FA2.KF12), response teams did not have
clear thresholds and criteria to assess the (actual
and potential) business, operational, financial and
reputational impacts of the cyber incident. As a result,
the initial response centred on understanding ‘the
what’, rather than quantifying the impact to inform
and set the strategic response strategy for effective
decision making.

FA2.KR14 Develop an integrated HSE-wide
incident classification and severity matrix for
assessing the organisational impact of an incident
(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)
The HSE should ensure it includes clear criteria to
determine the level of actual and/or potential likely
impacts of the Incident, and align with or supersede
the ‘HSE Risk Impact Table’.263 It should consider
specific impact categories - operational, clinical,
reputational, financial, regulatory/legal - and a method
for estimating impact based on impact and likelihood.
This should be embedded across all organisational
response plans and align with any technical severity
matrices, such as those in a technical cyber response
plan, to support consistency in response. This will
ensure responders are using a consistent approach to
anticipating immediate, ongoing and future impacts
to support a shared situational awareness.
FA2.KF15 The lack of pre-defined information
sharing processes led to inefficiencies in the
creation of a shared understanding of the Incident
As mentioned in finding FA2.KF12, the tools and
processes introduced by the Defence Forces on
18 May, enabled a more efficient meeting tempo
and information management. Information sharing
channels with HGs and CHOs via nominated liaison
officers and coordinators subsequently also took
shape.264
Several stakeholders noted that the sheer number
of coordination and information sharing meetings
required placed a strain on several critical HSE
stakeholders, who struggled to attend all meetings
and/or action response and recovery tasks.265
Interviewees from several HGs and CHOs also
reported that some initial meetings with the HSE
were time consuming, oversubscribed and, at times,
difficult to follow.266 A recurring theme was that
technical jargon generated confusion and delayed
decisions and actions. The lack of in-report standards
and a clear definition of what constituted ‘Red’,
‘Amber’ and ‘Green’ also led to initial confusion.267

cited an example where ICT staff had been deployed
to their site to clean laptops, but the hospital
leadership were unaware that they were present and
were still trying to work with the HSE to organise their
attendance.269 These differing understandings may
also have been compounded by use of unapproved
or informal channels for communicating with
stakeholders; for example many interviewees noted
they resorted to individualised phone calls, WhatsApp
and text messages to relay or obtain information first
hand where relationships existed.270, 271
FA2.KR15 Designate and train incident information
managers (or coordinators) at all levels across
an incident or crisis response to maintain a
consistent overview of the situation as it develops
(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)
Further to recommendation FA2.KR12, the HSE
should ensure that each workstream beneath the
SITCEN, at every command level and workstream,
has an information manager (or coordinator)
appointed as part of the Incident response team.
This role should be implemented in all local hospital
response teams, Regional/Area CMTs, and within
each HSE workstream up to the NCMT. As the
information manager completes their expected role
(digesting all information to gain a view of the endto-end incident), they should escalate their status
and update upwards (as with the SITREPs). This will
allow the SITCEN information manager to articulate
one consolidated account of events, decisions and
actions which will achieve situational awareness
across all teams and parties involved.
To embed this capability the HSE should train those
who have been assigned the role of information
manager/coordinator and complete multi-team
exercises to rehearse information sharing between
teams to maintain situational awareness. Templates
created as a result of the ransomware attack should
be further developed and embedded into scenariospecific response plans, in order to support the
information managers in their role. This structure and
format should be used in all teams and work streams
to maintain consistency.

There were instances when HGs and CHOs sent
requests for clarification and further support, but did
not receive a response and were unclear about how
to proceed.268 Similarly, some hospital stakeholders

FA2.KF16 There was no pre-agreed ‘out-of-band’
technology solution to support coordination,
collaboration and information sharing during a
crisis response
The HSE’s communications and information sharing
platforms were severely impacted by the attack. A
patchwork of technology solutions were brought
together to address this gap. The NCSC introduced
- a secure online chat and file sharing
platform - to support the HSE in coordinating and
collaborating during the initial incident response. The
HSE set up ‘clean’ email accounts for a handful of
key responders on a new HSEmail.ie domain272 and
leadership issued a special derogation and guidelines
for HSE staff to use personal emails for information
sharing.273
The Defence Force SITCEN Information Manager
established a directory and information sharing
structure on a Teams instance to facilitate centralised
coordination, collaboration and information sharing;
however, it was noted that not all workstreams were
storing their documentation in the Teams instance.274
More widely, HSE staff defaulted to the use of
WhatsApp, text message and phone calls to share
information. Stakeholders from HGs and CHOs also
noted in interviews that, in some instances, they
procured their own domains and IT infrastructure in
order to communicate and share information.275
This ad hoc approach ultimately provided a means by
which to share information; however, these solutions
had not been pre-agreed, risk assessed or authorised
for use by the HSE during ‘prepare’ phases prior
to the Incident, nor were incident responders and
staff made aware before the Incident that they
should be used. As a result, the HSE, HGs and
CHOs lacked a centralised and secure information
sharing, collaboration and coordination platform from
the outset of the Incident. This impeded the initial
response efforts, as well as leading to a long data
remediation tail (see also finding FA2.KF23).

FA2.KR16 Identify and acquire a secure and
resilient ‘out-of-band’ technology solution to
ensure an alternative means of information
sharing and communication (see tactical
recommendation 3.1 in section 4)
The HSE should ensure that the platform can
facilitate email, file sharing, call hosting and the
dissemination of communications to all staff and
segmented audiences, and enable all responders to
see situations reports, actions and decisions logs
and other information necessary to support a shared
understanding of the Incident.

Area 10: Response
leadership, strategy
setting and decision
making
FA2.KF17 The overarching response strategy was
underpinned by the core HSE value of patient
care; however, the initial response was driven by
technology priorities
It was widely acknowledged by stakeholders that
the HSE’s prioritisation strategy in the first week of
the Incident was driven by the OES list, informed
by regular communication between the HSE’s
OoCIO and COO functions and input from the
CCO.276,277,278Stakeholders noted that the response
strategy progressed to an approach that focused
on clinical risks and the recovery of end-to-end
clinical services, underpinned by the core HSE
value of patient care, following the co-location of all
responders to City West.279
The introduction of a ‘higher organisational intent’
directed at restoring systems that enable patient
care was formalised on day 11 of the response and
reflected in the daily SITCEN meeting rhythm, which
were aligned to facilitate a service-led response
strategy.280, 281 This service-led approach was then
consistently adopted and ensured patient care was
at the heart of all decisions made. The HSE would
have benefited from taking this approach earlier in
the response to allow for a more efficient recovery

programme, ultimately reducing impact on patient
care.
FA2.KR17 Ensure the ‘higher organisational intent’
is aligned to the organisational values and drives
the response and recovery strategy; review the
strategy regularly throughout the response as the
situation develops (see strategic recommendation
4.2 in section 4)
In this incident, the strategic priority was the
restoration and protection of systems underpinning
patient care services. The HSE should ensure that
all incident response strategies consider both the
technical and business response priorities, and are
informed by the impacts and requirements of the
hospitals, HGs and CHO.
Patient care may not always be restricted to the
maintenance of healthcare systems; the possible
implications of patient data exposure should be
considered in conjunction with discussions on patient
care, and incorporated into the HSE’s strategic intent
during a response. Consideration should be given
to how this strategy is cascaded to all levels of the
organisation, to direct the actions of the tactical and
operational response teams (see finding FA2.KF19)
and to inform the activities of third party support.
The response strategy should be reviewed regularly
during a response based on new information
and circumstances to ensure it is still valid and
appropriate. The development and implementation
of a response strategy should be a key focus
during crisis exercising, as this will facilitate a single
consistent approach to response and recovery
activities.
FA2.KF18 There was a lack of clearly defined and
delineated decision making authority between the
HSE, HGs and CHOs in the case of an HSE-wide
crisis
Several interviewees noted that there was no
strategic Crisis Management Plan or cyber response
guide with a clearly defined and documented decision
making process for senior leadership to follow, in the
event of a total IT outage or cyber crisis.282

282
283
284
285
286
287
288
289
290
291

Senior HSE leadership exhibited agile, yet reactive,
decision making in the absence of guidance that
was driven by organisational values, and grounded in
judgement and experience acquired from managing
previous crises (see also findings FA2.KF7 and FA2.
KF19). There was limited evidence of formal and
documented decision-making authorities between
the HSE, CHOs, HGs/hospitals during an HSE-wide
crisis (see also finding FA2.KF12). Existing service
level agreements between these organisations did not
include provision for these authorities,283, 284, 285 and
while the Incident Management Framework identifies
the need for decision-making authority, no specific
details were provided.286 Interviewees reported that
this led to some confusion at the beginning of the
response.287 The autonomy under which Voluntary
hospitals operate makes centralised decision making
more complex if the restrictions, constraints and
permissions around decision making authority are not
formally agreed and documented in advance.
For example, some hospital stakeholders reported
that the unilateral HSE decision to disconnect
national systems did not take into consideration
the level of system dependencies between the
HSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs, and potential risks
associated with rapid disconnection.288 There was
also no evidence to indicate that the authority for
that decision was documented and agreed.289290
Conversely, some hospital and CHO stakeholders
noted that local decisions were taken contrary to HSE
guidance when deemed in the hospital’s or CHO’s
best interest.291
FA2.KR18 Agree delineated decision making
authority across all teams in the organisation
likely to be involved in an organisation-wide
incident (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in
section 4)
The HSE should establish an organisational crisis
management structure, incorporating hospitals, HGs,
CHOs and contracted third parties, which clearly
defines the decision making authority at each level.
This structure should be socialised and embedded as
part of a regular training and exercising programme
for all responders (see finding FA2.KR8.3) to ensure it
meets the different priorities of all parties and remains
fit for purpose. Additional training should be provided

for the HSE, HG and CHO leadership to support them
in:
•

creating a shared situational awareness across
multiple sites or locations;

•

developing effective communication flows
between senior leadership across multiple sites or
locations;

•

establishing clear decision making and delegated
authority for senior leadership across multiple
sites or locations.

Critical stakeholders or response team members at
every level should therefore receive communication
about, and be trained and exercised in, the
predefined response structures to ensure the hooks
and handovers within every level of the command
model is understood and seamless during an
incident.

Area 11: Stakeholder
management, crisis
communications and
reputation management
FA2.KF19 The lack of internal communications
tools and diffuse nature of the health service
hindered the ability to send nuanced and targeted
messages to staff
The HSE Communications team managed the
external communications and media agenda
effectively, ensuring the focus of reporting was
consistently brought back to patient service and care
implications. Through interviews and workshops it
was evident that EMT members involved in media
messages displayed a consistent and informed
approach, receiving support and coaching from the
experienced senior Communications team members
before any public event.292
In contrast, the internal communications capability
was stretched to meet the demands of the Incident
(see also finding FA2.KF6). The absence of a
comprehensive mass emergency notification and
communications tool meant only staff with HSE
devices received the initial ‘blast’ messages (see
also findings FA2.KF6 and FA2.KF7). There was no
pre-prepared method by which to communicate with

292
293
294
295

staff in a segmented manner, therefore there was
no capability to target different messages to distinct
groups of staff. This was exacerbated by the vast
and diffuse structure of the HSE, including multiple
disparate smaller community organisations. The
Internal Communications team ultimately facilitated
a workaround whereby updates were published on
the publicly available HSE website, and staff were
directed via phone calls and social media to check for
updates.293
Stakeholders noted that improvements to the internal
communications capability were made following
WannaCry in 2017 - replacing the ‘antiquated’
intranet with a new website - and the internal
Communications Team was formally established in
2019; however, the capability is not adequate for
responding to crises of this magnitude.294
FA2.KR19 Familiarise the Internal Communications
Team with the ‘out of band’ technology solution
to enable focused and targeted communications
during a crisis (see also recommendation FA2.KR16
and tactical recommendation 3.1 in section 4)
The HSE should set up user accounts for all staff
members pre-incident on the selected ‘out of band’
communication platform to expedite transition to
the new platform during a system outage. Staff
members should be familiarised with the platform
and its functionality ahead of an incident. Details
for all alternative user accounts should be recorded
centrally and stored offline to ensure contact
information for all staff members is readily available
during any disruption to the HSE’s standard
communications channels. Crisis response and
communications workstream leads should establish
cascading contact trees to notify staff of an incident,
to initiate the use of the out of band platform, and
to enact specific channels for the discussion of
response and recovery activities between core
responders. This will allow workstreams to maintain a
central repository of useful information and act as an
audit trail for post incident review and reporting.
FA2.KF20 Potential data exposure has heightened
risk to patients and created long remediation
requirements
The HSE took several steps to manage the impact of
potential data exposure following the cyber attack,
despite the absence of scenario-specific plans295
and related workstream structures reflected in the
MEM or IM Frameworks (see also findings FA2.KF5

and FA2.KF12). They established the Legal and Data
Workstream on the 19th of May to:
•

Oversee the response and investigation from a
legal and data protection perspective arising from
the cyber attack;

•

Maintain a consistent approach to data protection
and legal actions to ensure all regulatory
requirements are met;

•

Support the Data Protection Officer (DPO) in
coordinating the data protection investigation
and reporting to the Data Protection and
Commission;296

•

•

Complete the work of the Legal and Data
Workstream in response to the Incident. This
includes reconciling all medical data stored and
managed through interim processes post the
attack, including data stored on personal devices/
accounts and in paper form;

•

Embed the Legal and Data Workstream in
the Crisis Management Framework (see also
recommendation FA2.KR5.1 and FA2.KR12);

•

Update the existing Data Protection Breach
Management Policy to support the Legal and
Data Workstream in future responses, including
the data breach notification risk assessment;

•

Rehearse the workstream’s response both
individually and as part of wider HSE exercising
programme (see also recommendation FA2.
KR8.3);

•

Agree retainers with third parties for future web
monitoring services;

•

Ensure materials used to support the notification
of data subjects, such as letters, FAQs and talking
points, are agreed with the Communications
Team;

•

Conduct resource planning for future notification
programmes; for example, call centres to respond
to the significant influx of incoming requests once
data subjects are notified.

Assist and report on the ongoing investigation of
An Garda Síochána297

Related decisions, such as informing the Data
Protection Commission (DPC),298obtaining a court
order to prevent the publication and sharing of stolen
data and setting up web monitoring services,299 were
actioned quickly to mitigate the potential impact of
data loss. A Legal and Data Steering Committee
was subsequently set up to oversee risk-based
decisions relating to the approach to, and threshold
for, breach notification to data subjects whose
data may have been compromised and the wider
public.300 Third parties were also called on to support
this risk assessment. This work is ongoing and
may continue for an extended period of time as the
HSE reviews and seeks to mitigate any risk to data
subjects’ rights and freedoms. While thresholds for
notification have been identified, the HSE is in the
early stages of scenario and resource planning of
the actual notification process, including the liaison
with the HSE Communications team on how these
notifications should be rolled out. As such the HSE
has not yet made any data subject notifications, and
no standard resources or templates for notification
exist, or have yet been tailored/created for this event.
The HSE continues to work closely with funded
entities to understand the extent of the potential
data exposure and share their risk assessment
methodology for notification threshold.

Area 12: Scenario
planning
FA2.KF21 Scenario planning did not inform
response and recovery strategies
Stakeholders stated that, despite having dealt with a
vast array of major emergencies, they felt ill-prepared
for dealing with an IT outage or cyber crisis of this
scale, or a specific ransomware attack (see also
finding FA2.KF8). Specifically, individuals initially
struggled to comprehend the scale and size of the
Incident, and felt unable to foresee the contingent

impacts that may occur over time.301 As with many
organisations impacted by ransomware attacks, there
was initially a belief that the Incident would cause
impact for several days to weeks, before a realisation
dawned that these types of events, and their longer
term impacts, play out over several weeks and
months.
This uncertainty stemmed, in part, from a lack
of any formal scenario planning process within
the existing Major Emergency Management and
Incident Management Frameworks and pre-prepared
scenario-specific playbooks. Scenario-specific
playbooks define the likely decisions and actions
required of a senior team, given the potential risks
and impacts of the scenario (see also finding FA2.
KF5). The existence of a cyber response plan or
ransomware playbook would have supported the
NCMT’s ability to foresee the likely impacts and
consequences of the Conti attack, combatting
what one stakeholder described as ‘a failure of
imagination’.
The HSE also does not have a formal overarching
process or system to guide the use of scenario
planning during crisis response, in order to inform the
response and recovery strategy during an incident,
irrespective of the nature of that event. This would
involve identifying potential triggers and escalators for
the worst, best and most likely scenarios; identifying
consequent likely impacts; and implementing
mitigating measures. While some stakeholders noted
they were able to conduct hasty scenario planning
during the Incident, particularly when determining
patient care workarounds, this was performed in an
ad hoc fashion at the hospital or CHO level.
FA2.KR21 Scenario planning should be informed
by the risk register, the process embedded in
the Crisis Management Plan, and the activity
conducted throughout incident and crisis
response (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in
section 4)
The HSE should ensure that the risk register is
used to drive the creation of severe but plausible
scenarios against which the HSE should validate its
resilience capability is validated. The process should
be extended to engage individuals from the HSE’s
senior leadership team, risk management, clinical and
services continuity and crisis management disciplines
in regular scenario planning against the organisation’s

top risks.302,303 This is best conducted in a workshop
format to identify potential political, economic,
sociological, technical, legal and regulatory,
environmental and organisational impacts related to
each of the HSE’s top risks, and to then explore the
worst, best and most likely scenarios for each.
Mitigating actions resulting from these workshops
should be assigned to an owner with the appropriate
level of authority to facilitate organisational change
where required, and tracked throughout their lifecycle
to confirm they are completed to an acceptable
level. These actions and all other outputs from these
activities should be used to inform preparation
activities across resilience disciplines, to ensure that
plans, processes and structures are fit for purpose;
and where applicable specific response plans to
be developed for the most plausible risks (see also
findings FA2.KR5.2).
Scenario planning should be included in the Crisis
Management Plan to support HSE to prepare for
likely outcomes and mitigate subsequent impacts
during a response.

Area 13: Effectiveness of
workarounds
FA2.KF22 Emergency workarounds implemented
across the HSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs were ad
hoc and not always based on predefined solutions
or processes, and have caused long remediation
tails.
It was widely reported that responders across the
HSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs implemented timely
and agile workarounds that allowed core critical
processes to continue in the absence of IT.304, 305 306
The lack of preparedness for a cyber incident of this
scale, including a lack of Clinical and Services Impact
Analysis and scenario-specific playbooks for cyber
response, meant that whilst many workarounds were
pre-agreed and rehearsed, others were defined in an
ad hoc manner; as there was no systematic approach
to maintaining continuity of patient-critical processes
(see also findings FA2.KF3, FA2.KF4 and FA2.KF23).
In some cases, predefined workarounds were familiar
to responders and well-rehearsed, for example, where
clinicians were able to switch from digital to paper-

based procedures.307 However, several stakeholders
noted that the workarounds were primarily designed
for individual systems or processes and proved to be
time limited, thereby not suitable for continued use
throughout the recovery from a total and lasting IT
outage. Additionally, whilst staff in community service
environments had experience relying on paper patient
charts and were able to adapt quickly, the after action
review (AAR) collated by the HSE identified that some
staff (clinical and non-clinical) had never worked
in a paper-based system and so risked missing
relevant information from the different format used
in paper documentation.308 This introduced a risk of
information loss if it was not ultimately uploaded into
the patient data management system.
Other workarounds, although creative, were devised
during the Incident and, as a result, had not been
reviewed from an overarching security or risk
perspective. Many workarounds were documented
as issues in the Programme RAID Log,309 such as the
use of runners to convey lab samples and test results,
and the use of whiteboards and shared excel sheets
on standalone laptops to populate hospital bed
bureaus, due to the increased risk of human error.
The risks associated with the continuation of clinical
treatment and the use of operational workarounds
were assessed and communicated on a regular basis,
including clinical guidance on how treatments should
be prioritised and managed.310, 311 Many of these
workarounds carried a risk of loss or contamination of
patient data, misplacement of patients and incorrect
disclosure of patient data, all with a secondary risk of
patient care being negatively impacted. One example
quoted during interviews that illustrates the lack of
accurate patient data, was of a surgeon questioning
the whereabouts of a patient due for surgery, when
that patient had already been operated on.
Several of the emergency workarounds established
to support information sharing and allow individuals
and teams to respond at pace, such as the use of
personal emails and devices, WhatsApp and paper
records, have resulted in an ongoing data remediation
risk. Many stakeholders noted that some of the
workarounds implemented were not designed with
consideration of the need to consolidate and retrofit
data when systems were restored.312, 313 Whilst some
interviewees noted they had hired extra resources
to manually enter paper-based clinical information
to restored systems, the absence of IT systems has

resulted in large volumes of paper records, some
of which are likely to include duplicate, incomplete
or incorrect data that will need to be investigated
and remediated. The backload of COVID-19 data
in conjunction with the clinical data from the
ransomware attack will likely take considerable time,
people and resources to rectify.
The HSE issued a communication on 12 August 2021
to stand down the use of personal emails and ensure
all data was deleted from local storage areas.314
However, some stakeholders from hospitals and
CHOs reported they have not received clear guidance
on the steps required to address this risk. The
absence of an assigned owner for the remediation of
clinical data will make it difficult for staff members to
direct enquiries relating to correct data handling and
remediation, resulting in delayed resolution of the
issue.
FA2.KR22.1 Design clinical and services
continuity workarounds, informed by the Clinical
and Services Impact Analysis (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in section 4)
The HSE should design and agree clinical and
services continuity workarounds, for critical
processes, with the agility and governance to be
maintained for a prolonged period, and based on
the Clinical and Services Impact Analysis (see also
recommendations FA2.KR3.1, FA2.KR4 and FA2.
KR23).
FA2.KR22.2 Design workarounds to support rapid
data remediation post-incident or crisis (see
tactical recommendation 1.2 in section 4)
The HSE should:
•

Establish a pre-agreed out of band
communications and information sharing
platform (see also finding FA2.KR16) to ensure
data generated by workarounds outside normal
operations is captured in a format that can easily
be retrofitted with the information held on HSE
systems. As part of the organisation’s stand-down
process, each site and workstream should assign
an individual with responsibility for overseeing the
consolidation of patient and service data; and

•

Reconcile all medical data stored and managed
through interim processes post the attack,

including data stored on personal devices/
accounts and in paper form.
FA2.KR22.3 Rehearse workarounds in multi-team
exercises (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in
section 4)
The HSE, HGs and CHOs should participate in
multi-team exercises to explore how high impact or
likely scenarios could impact their operations. This
is extremely important as it helps identify likely and
potential impacts to the organisation and responders.
These may often need a team and significant
investment to resolve, however even the discussion
and establishment of hypothetical workarounds will
likely reduce the number of ineffective emergency
protocols and allow space for creative thinking to
consider the ideal solution for all parties involved (see
also recommendation FA2.KR8.3).
FA2.KR22.4 Consider a review to establish the
longer term clinical impacts of the Conti attack
(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)
Finally, the HSE should consider conducting a review
to understand the longer term clinical impacts that
resulted from the Conti attack. This review should
build on the findings of the draft research report into
the effectiveness of the patient safety risk mitigation
strategies following the Incident,315 and inform future
steps to improve the HSE resilience against potential
future attacks and minimise the risk to patient care.

Crisis Recovery

Area 14: Services and data
led recovery strategy
FA2.KF23 The lack of a comprehensive, current
and accessible Clinical and Services Impact
Analysis, Configuration Management Database,
and asset register delayed recovery efforts
Whilst the HSE were clear in their intent to prioritise
patient care and maintain its OES list, without an
up to date clinical and services Impact Analysis
or configuration management database (CMDB)
response teams were initially unable to assess
resource requirements and prioritise the recovery of
critical services.

As part of the incident response, the HSE established
a data workstream to build an understanding of all
applications and their dependencies for recovery,
collating data from unaffected systems, existing
documentation and undocumented knowledge from
HSE staff and supporting vendors. The requirement
to build this list and then prioritise applications for
recovery during the Incident, rather than being able
to rely on an (offline and accessible) pre-prepared
Clinical and Services Impact Analysis, Configuration
Management Database and asset register, delayed
recovery efforts. The HSE also noted in their Lessons
Learned Log that the complexity and disparate
ownership of the HSE IT combined with the lack of an
overarching impact assessment (see also finding FA2.
KF14), made it difficult to plan the recovery efforts.316
The recovery priorities set centrally by the HSE
initially focused on the priority restoration of core
national applications, e.g., NIMIS.317 While this
approach was widely agreed, the subsequent
prioritisation of the smaller and more disparate
applications, particularly at the hospital and CHO
level, was less straightforward. Stakeholders noted
that following the restoration of core national
applications, some peripheral applications used by
) to communicate with
CHOs (such as
patients and carers, were not prioritised adequately
given their place underpinning critical CHO services,
due to a lack of perceived importance.
Services were prioritised into three classifications:
category A (national core applications), category B
(major clinical applications) and category C (priority
applications).318 Applications moved between
these categories throughout the response based
on recommendations made during the daily Major
Incident meetings. Responders attempted to prioritise
systems based on the effectiveness of workarounds,
and how long they could be maintained. However,
this approach did not consider the connections
between systems requiring restoration. A recurring
finding was that several applications reported to
be ‘green’ were not yet functional at the time of
reporting, due to a lack of data on the dependencies
between impacted infrastructure, applications and
data. One example of this is when access to IPMS
was initially blocked by delays in the restoration
of Active Directory and Citrix,319 a delay that took
over two weeks to fix, postponing the resumption
of business as usual services. The recovery of
systems requires the restoration of trusted network
connections and information exchanges, all of which

rely on a clear understanding of which systems are
interconnected, and what is required for them to work
together.
There was also limited consideration of how the IT
landscape differed at a central and local level; CHOs
and HGs found that third parties brought in to support
the prioritisation and restoration of applications
did not have a strong understanding of the local
environments and their requirements for recovery,
impeding the ability to set clear and sequenced
recovery priorities.
FA2.KR23 Ensure the Clinical and Services Impact
Analysis is informed by an up-to-date asset
register and Configuration Management Database
(see also findings FA2.KF3 and FA2.KF22.1 and
tactical recommendation 1.3 in Section 4)
As part of this process, the HSE should work with
CHOs and HGs to develop a clear overview of the
interdependencies between all departments and
local sites using HSE infrastructure or services, with
the aim to create a prioritised list for systems at both
a central and local level. This should be informed
by a service model for delivering patient care. The
HSE should reconcile all medical data stored and
managed through interim processes post the attack,
including data stored on personal devices/accounts
and in paper form (see also finding FA2.KR22.2).
Contingency plans should be developed by the
business owners and IT teams to maintain priority
and critical services (as defined in a Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis) during the disruption of
one or more key systems. These plans should be
socialised and embedded across the organisation,
and a version of them stored offline, to ensure they
can be implemented effectively during an incident. In
the event of an incident impacting multiple systems,
as within the Conti attack, recovery prioritisation
should be addressed on a regular basis from the
beginning of the response, to direct resources to the
appropriate systems and services from the offset.
FA2.KF24 Recovery efforts were hindered by
the lack of a predefined recovery process and
targeted supporting resources
Several stakeholders noted that recovery efforts
were hindered by the lack of resources and inability
to allocate them in the most efficient manner. As
mentioned in finding FA2.KF3, without a Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis to clearly articulate priorities
and sequences of recovery, the HSE, HGs and
CHOs were unable to create an informed recovery

strategy in the initial days. This, coupled with the
absence of information available on the HSE’s
assets and services (see also finding FA2.KF23),
meant that technical teams relied on queries and
information submitted to a central mailbox set up for
the response and on data gathered from vendors and
suppliers. The speed with which applications could
therefore be prioritised and communicated to the
technical recovery teams was not therefore optimal.
Specifically, responders noted that the absence of
a predefined priority list and overall process flow
meant the Tech and Data Ops teams were at risk of
under- and over-utilisation due to workflow issues.320
This extended to third party support who relied on
central coordination from the HSE to direct their
recovery efforts. There were missed opportunities
to recover applications in parallel and technical
responders risked being redeployed onto other
recovery areas,321 delaying or preventing their return
to application restoration once a new set of priorities
was established. Indeed where responders were left
without targeted guidance on what to restore they
relied on informal conversations to determine which
teams were struggling, and directed their attention
there.
FA2.KR24 Map and document the people and
technology resources and processes required
to recover all critical systems in a pre-defined
sequence (see tactical recommendation 1.3 in
Section 4)
The HSE should ensure that the Cyber Incident
Response Playbook322 documents a pathway to
recovery that maps the people, processes and
technology requirements of each system, to provide a
pathway to recovery in the event of single or multiple
system failure. During a major outage or disruption,
recovery priorities should be agreed with central and
local response and IT teams and communicated to all
responders to streamline the recovery of integrated
and independent systems. Once recovery priorities
have been agreed, incident response mechanisms
need to be invoked that provide the most effective
communication and coordination between teams.
Central coordination meetings should be held with
the asset and application register acting as a tool to
guide recovery activities. A read-only, and regularly
updated, list of prioritised applications should be
made available to all technical recovery teams to
direct their activities and keep them informed of the
actions being undertaken across the response.

To achieve this an operational rhythm needs to be
established by:
•

Setting up a meeting cadence at and between
each response level e.g., operational or “Bronze”
(HG and CHO) meeting followed by a tactical or
“Silver” (HSE) meeting, then a strategic or “Gold”
(EMT) meeting to share a cascade of updates
increasing in importance, escalating priorities.323
This waterfall flow between the command levels
should also be used in reverse to share decisions
and actions simultaneously to all teams and
impacted sites;

•

Each meeting following a set agenda to ensure
all required areas are covered off, particularly in
terms of situational awareness of the Incident;

•

Use of uniform templates for collecting incident
updates, action tracking and required decisions.

It is recommended that at each level of response
there is a dedicated role to ensure coordination within
and between teams. This can be the role of a Crisis
Coordinator or SITCEN Information Manager (see
also finding FA2.KF15).

Focus area 2 conclusion
Despite a lack of pre-prepared structures and
processes, the HSE exhibited an agile and reactive
response to the Conti ransomware attack in May
2021. Prior learnings, behaviours and processes,
many of which were exercised during the COVID-19
response, were leveraged to ensure critical systems
and processes were recovered, and to deliver safety
critical patient care across the country. The lengths
to which staff and vendors went to keep patients
safe and facilitate a recovery within the operating
constraints is a direct reflection of the leadership that
was employed during this crisis. The behaviours,
structures and processes designed reactively during
the response to the attack should be leveraged and
embedded into new crisis structures, to ensure the
HSE is better able to respond at pace to future risks
when they materialise.
Individuals within the HSE have described it as an
organisation constantly responding to crises. To date,
the HSE’s approach to preparedness for disruptive
events has been driven through the Major Emergency
Management Framework. Events previously in
scope of the Framework can be categorised as short
term, national events caused by adverse weather
or accidents, which created a temporary surge in
demand on the HSE’s clinical and acute services.
The normalisation of crisis events in the HSE has

generated a sense of over confidence throughout
the organisation, whereby the forward planning has
become restricted to contingencies for predictable or
recognisable threats and risks. Specifically, the HSE’s
crisis planning has been based on the assumption
that all critical infrastructure and processes would
be available to support a crisis response. There was
therefore no contingency planning for a cyber attack,
or any other scenario involving the denial or loss of
infrastructure, people, or facilities.
Prior to the cyber attack, outside of the Major
Emergency Management Framework, there was no
integrated organisation-wide Crisis Management
Framework in place to deal with a major internal
crisis event. In the absence of documented plans,
the HSE’s COVID-19 response imparted a degree
of inherent preparedness, which manifested itself in
a flexible and agile response from all of its people
across all levels. However, the structures required
to respond to the crisis caused by the ransomware
attack were only achieved with assistance from the
Defence Forces in the weeks following the attack.
The lack of pre-planned contingencies contributed
to increased levels of stress and fatigue in HSE staff
during the initial stages of the response and recovery.
The HSE requires a Crisis Management Framework,
which sits alongside the MEM Framework, but with a
separate focus on responding to crises which do not
necessitate an interagency response.
Clinical and services continuity has not been a
corporate priority in the HSE until recently, when
enterprise risk management and clinical and services
continuity were consolidated under the National
Director for Governance and Risk. Consequently
the level of clinical and services continuity and
crisis preparedness across the organisation varies
significantly. Due to a historic lack of governance and
oversight, a fragmented and incoherent clinical and
services continuity capability has evolved across the
organisation. This delayed the implementation of an
initial coherent response and recovery effort during
the Incident.
There are many learnings to be taken from any
response to an incident this significant. The HSE
must expand upon initiatives already taken and
implement a coherent operational resilience
capability, including clinical and services continuity
and crisis management, across the organisation. Key
actions for the HSE to take to establish organisationwide preparedness to significant incidents and crises
disrupting its operations include:
•

Define the governance arrangements and
structures to ensure clear and ongoing oversight,

emergency and crisis management

management, and reporting of the operational
resilience disciplines, with a particular focus on
implementation and integration of the crisis and
clinical and services continuity disciplines;
•

Establish the Crisis Management Framework,
detailing levels of response and supporting teams
and processes to manage any significant incident
or disruption impacting HSE operations;

•

Develop supporting crisis documentation,
including strategic, tactical and operational
plans, procedures, tools and templates; scenario
specific playbooks for pre-defined threats and
risks, supported by clearly defined clinical and
services continuity strategies, a resourcing
assessment and cost base analysis of chosen
solutions;

•

Cascade the Framework, tools and templates
throughout the organisation, and to HGs and
CHOs, to ensure a coherent and standardised
response across all parties involved in a crisis
response;

•

Embed crisis management and clinical and
services continuity across the organisation by
establishing a formalised HSE-wide training and
exercising programme and schedule to develop
awareness, familiarity, and competence for all
stakeholders involved in incident response.

HSE maturity assessment ratings
Using the PIR Cybersecurity Framework, PwC conducted interviews with key stakeholders and reviewed key
documents from the HSE and relevant third parties. This provided PwC with sufficient evidence to enable each
of the 23 sub-domains to be assessed against the CMMI model. Assessments were then averaged per their
domain and an overall maturity rating achieved.
A summary of the maturity ratings by key domain is illustrated below. Our assessment demonstrated that the
HSE is at an “initial’’ CMMI maturity stage across the 5 key domains. Cybersecurity and governance processes
are predominantly ad hoc, informal, and not well organised. This represents a very low level of maturity for
cybersecurity and is significantly behind where an organisation of its size and risk profile should be. It is our
experience that organisations with this level of maturity carry an unacceptable level of risk and frequently fall
victim to cyber attack, and often regulatory action. An organisation like the HSE should be aiming for a rating
of at least 3 and higher. The HSE OoCIO has an ambition324 to reach a maturity rating of between 2.6 and 3.5.
Considerable resources and investment will be required to achieve this ambition across all 5 NIST domains. It
should be noted that similar organisations that PwC has reviewed have ratings of between 2.6 to 2.95.

Identify - The rating reflects the immaturity in the understanding of cybersecurity within the HSE. There was a
lack of understanding of the business context, the resources that supported critical functions, and the related
cybersecurity risks.
Protect - The rating is based on the lack of appropriate safeguards that should have ensured delivery of critical
infrastructure services. A mature protect function would support the ability to limit or contain the impact of a
cybersecurity event.
Detect - The rating reflects the absence of appropriate activities that were used to identify the occurrence
of the cybersecurity event. The incident indicates that the HSE lacked the ability for timely discovery of the
cybersecurity event.
Respond - The rating indicates that the appropriate activities to act regarding a detected cybersecurity incident
were lacking in the HSE. The impact of a cybersecurity incident was widespread and was only contained by
shutting down the network.
Recover - The rating reflects the immaturity in maintaining plans for resilience and the restoration of any
capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident in a timely manner, in a way to reduce
the incident’s impact.

Summary of NIST recommendations
Note: Recommendations are categorised as immediate (starting immediately and completed within six months)
and medium-term (with a phased plan for implementation to be developed and completed within 18 months).
Figure 18: Focus area 3 key NIST recommendations

Immediate term

1. Governance (see tactical recommendation 1.5 in Section 4.2) - The HSE should
recruit a senior leader to act as an interim Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
to begin with the implementation of a cybersecurity incident management process
to include detection and response strategies and to assign roles and responsibilities
for cybersecurity incident response throughout the HSE. A tactical cybersecurity
improvement programme with appropriate governance and dedicated resources that
reports into the interim CISO and can provide updates on the programme’s progress
into the Board.
2. Monitoring (see tactical recommendation 2.1 in Section 4.2) - The HSE should
accelerate the deployment of a Security Incident Event Management (“SIEM”)
technology and build a Security Operations Centre (“SOC”) to leverage the SIEM
functionality. The SIEM, in conjunction with anti-virus tools and the threat intelligence
inputs, will provide the HSE with greater threat management and the ability to detect
and respond effectively to any future cybersecurity incident.
3. Vulnerability management (see strategic recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1)
- The HSE should begin a formal process of addressing all known vulnerabilities
highlighted by Internal Audit and ICT across the HSE network. Acquire protective
technology to monitor and block traffic that could remove sensitive data from the
HSE or attempt to compromise systems supporting clinical services. Empower
administrative staff via a phased deployment of Privileged Access Management and
Network Administrator Software to enable the central and standard management of
servers and network infrastructure. Continue with employee cybersecurity awareness
training and run a phishing campaign to reinforce good cybersecurity hygiene in all
employees.

94 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

Medium term

1. Recruit a permanent CISO with a supporting team (see strategic
recommendation 3.1 in Section 4.1) - The CISO should be at National Director
level, a direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate access to the EMT and their
agenda, to ensure that cybersecurity risks are understood and considered in all
decision-making. The CISO should be responsible for cybersecurity operations as
well as driving strategic and tactical actions to transform cybersecurity capability.
The CISO should be provided with the resources to build a supporting cybersecurity
team structure in the HSE. This structure would include all aspects of cybersecurity
capability including operations, risk management, strategy, architecture, engineering,
and investigations.
2. Develop a specific cybersecurity strategy for the HSE (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in Section 4.1) - to provide the HSE with a multi-year
transformation programme to address highlighted issues from this PIR and build
defence in depth over time. Such issues would include a complete IT asset register,
a completed and managed CMDB that is aligned to a Service Catalogue to capture
key Clinical and Corporate services, as well as a roadmap to address open Internal
Audit findings each year.
3. Governance (see strategic recommendation 1.1 in Section 4.1) - Implement a
dedicated cybersecurity Board oversight committee to report on risks on a regular
basis. This committee should report on all relevant technology updates, patching,
audit findings and threat intelligence. This committee should provide the Board with
a contextualised perspective of cybersecurity risk across the HSE.

Key findings

Key recommendations

Asset Management

FA3. KF1 The HSE did not have
a complete and accurate IT
asset register, a Configuration
Management Database (CMDB)
or a defined asset management
methodology.

FA3. KR1 (see tactical recommendation
1.3 in Section 4.2) The HSE should
continue to develop an asset register
that is aligned to clinical and corporate
services, as well as underpinning
a process to ensure the register is
maintained up to date. Doing so will allow
the HSE to determine the potential impact
of any future incident and effectively
respond in a controlled and structured
manner.

Business
Environment

FA3. KF2 The HSE did not
have a defined and agreed
cybersecurity strategy nor
a formalised risk appetite
statement that it could be
aligned to.

FA3. KR2 (see tactical recommendation
1.4 in Section 4.2) The HSE should
create a cybersecurity strategy, covering
at a minimum incident detection, incident
response and business recovery. It will
also need to be aligned to the HSE
strategy objectives and signed off by the
HSE Board.

FA3. KF3.1 An information
cybersecurity governance
framework (policy, process,
standards) to manage cyber risk
did not exist within the HSE.

Identify

FA3. KF3.2 The HSE did not
have a structured and robust
process to ensure suspicious
activity that was detected and/
or reported on applications or
infrastructure (servers or on the
NHN) was properly investigated
and appropriately reported to the
OoCIO SMT and the HSE EMT.

Initial

Governance

FA3. KF3.3 The HSE did not
have adequate assurance
processes in place to ensure
the HSE EMT and Board had
oversight of OoCIO operational
processes. In the absence of
assurance processes the HSE
Board did not have sufficient
visibility over the operation of
these processes or comfort they
were operating in line with HSE
Policy and standards.
FA3. KF3.4 The HSE did not
have a CISO or dedicated senior
executive with responsibility for
cybersecurity governance.

FA3. KR3 (see strategic
recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1)
The HSE should establish an appropriate
cybersecurity risk and governance
framework to ensure there is a consistent
and clear allocation of responsibility,
authority, and accountability. Including the
need to establish reporting processes to
ensure potential cybersecurity incidents
are appropriately reported in all cases.
This should provide a forum for key
stakeholders e.g., Clinical Operations,
Corporate Services, Third Party service
managers, Sections 38s and 39s
have a forum to discuss and align on
cybersecurity priorities. Providing required
assurance to the Board and facilitating
effective management at Board level.
The HSE should appoint a senior leader
for cybersecurity (a CISO) who has
experience rapidly reducing organisations
vulnerability to threat, designing cyber
security transformation programmes,
and providing assurance to Boards
of management. This should provide
the required assurance to the Board
in facilitating effective cybersecurity
management.

FA3. KF3.5 There was no
dedicated committee that
provided direction and oversight
of cybersecurity and the
activities required to reduce the
HSE’s cyber risk exposure.

Regulation

FA3. KF4 The HSE had not
completed its Operator of
Essential Services (OES) return
to comply with the Network and
Information Systems Directive
(NISD) since 2019. In addition,
while continual progress was
made to resolve HSE Internal
Audit issues, a number remained
unresolved.

Risk Management

FA3. KF5 A cybersecurity risk
framework for the HSE did not
exist.

FA3. KR5 (see tactical recommendation
3 in Section 4.2) The HSE should develop
a formal cybersecurity risk framework
aligned to the business’ operational risks
and strategic plans.

Supply Chain Risk
Management

FA3. KF6 Third Party Risk (TPR)
was not effectively managed as
no formal process existed that
would assess suppliers and
manage this risk appropriately.
Processes did not ensure
Business System Managers
were appointed in all cases to be
responsible and accountable for
the delivery of services within the
assigned service area in line with
nationally defined frameworks,
standards and policies.

FA3. KR6 (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4.1)
The HSE should implement a Third
Party Risk Management framework that
defines how third parties to the HSE are
assessed for cybersecurity risks and what
risk treatment plans are appropriate to
address residual cyber risk.

Initial

97 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

FA3. KR4 (see tactical recommendation
2 in Section 4.2) The HSE should
complete its required OES returns on
an annual basis to ensure compliance
with NISD regulations and to understand
potential cybersecurity weaknesses with
critical services.

People Security

FA3. KF7 There was no
comprehensive formal
cybersecurity awareness or
training program in the HSE
that ensured people were
sufficiently trained to perform
their duties in a manner
consistent with policy.

FA3. KR7 (see strategic
recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1) The
HSE should introduce a comprehensive,
formalised cybersecurity training and
awareness programme that is delivered
to all staff at all grades across the
organisation. This should be conducted
on a regular basis.

FA3. KF8 The HSE Access
Control Policy was last
reviewed in 2014 and was not
fit for purpose. In addition,
there was no central access
control process for all HSE
applications.

FA3. KR8 (see tactical recommendation
3.1 in Section 4.2) The HSE should
introduce centralised processes and
procedures to manage and review the
appropriate access and identities that
require access to services and data.
This should be in the form of an Identity
Access Management (IAM) solution that
would consistently manage access across
users, System Admins and third parties.

Data Security

FA3. KF9 ICT HSE should
formalise a backup strategy to
enable the efficient restoration
of services.

FA3. KR9 (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in Section 4.1)
ICT HSE should implement a structured
process for performing data backups and
storing this data off site. Regular testing
of this data should take place to ensure
success recovery.

Protective Technology

FA3. KF10 Protective
technology e.g., AV software
was implemented in an ad-hoc
manner, not consistently or
against a clear set of threatbased requirements.

FA3. KR10 (see strategic
recommendation 3.1 in Section 4.1)
The HSE should develop a strategy for
adopting the appropriate protective
technologies and ensure consistent
deployment across the HSE network.

IT Baseline
Maintenance

FA3. KF11 The HSE did not
maintain security baselines for
all operational hardware and
software, and the patching
processes did not ensure
preventative maintenance and
vulnerability management was
performed in a timely manner.

FA3. KR11 (see strategic
recommendation 3.1 in Section 4.1)
The HSE should develop a process
to maintain security baselines for all
operational hardware and software,
including but not limited to establishing
preventative processes such as patch
and vulnerability management processes.

Key recommendations

IT Events and
Threat Management
(including: Detection
Technology)

FA3. KF12 The HSE did not
have the capability to detect
security events relating to this
incident, across its network
due to a lack of technology
deployed, ad hoc processes
and very limited resources to
monitor events.

FA3. KR12 (see tactical
recommendation 4 in Section 4.2) The
HSE should develop a cybersecurity
threat profile that is informed by relevant
sources to enable an effective monitoring
capability. This should include threat
intelligence feeds to provide an informed
view of the latest cyber threats relevant
to the HSE. These feeds should be used
in conjunction with a SIEM to inform and
provide IOCs for monitoring and detecting
across the HSE ICT estate. Aligned to
this the HSE should implement anti-virus
consistently across the estate, ensure it
as well as logging and EDR outputs are
aggregated and obtain a 24x7 security
operations centre (SOC) to monitor the
entire business and detect anomalous
behaviour and events.

Continuous
Monitoring

FA3. KF13 The HSE did not
have an effective continuous
monitoring capability that
would identify and manage
security events.

FA3. KR13 (see tactical
recommendation 2 in Section 4.2) The
HSE should implement alert monitoring
on all network servers, endpoint devices,
and firewalls for the external and internal
networks. Specific use cases for each
alert should be developed for the chosen
SIEM.

Detection Processes

FA3. KF14 The HSE did
not have a structured and
robust process to detect
and respond to activity on
the network, nor an effective
escalation path to senior
management for reporting and
validation of events

FA3. KR14 (see strategic
recommendation 2 in Section 4.1) The
HSE should implement a holistic network
detection and response functionality with
a dedicated team to continually monitor
for and respond to alerts.

Key findings

Main recommendations

Response Planning

FA3. KF15 The HSE had not
identified the viable clinical
and services continuity
options across people,
process and technology,
nor had the HSE defined
requirements for achieving
clinical and services continuity
in accordance with its risk
appetite. In particular the HSE
did not have an appropriate
response policy, plan, or
run books for cybersecurity
incidents.

FA3. KR15 (see tactical
recommendation 3 in Section 4.2)
The HSE should develop an appropriate
cybersecurity response policy,
supported by plans and/or run books for
cybersecurity incidents that are regularly
reviewed and exercised so that it can
mount an effective and efficient response
in the event of a future incident.

Communications

FA3. KF16 The HSE
did not have an internal
communication plan or a crisis
communication system for
sharing messages in the event
of a cybersecurity incident.

FA3. KR16 (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4.1)
The HSE should develop a formal
internal communications plan where
key internal parties such as senior
leadership, voluntary hospitals, CHOs
are receiving timely and consistent
messages. Specifically, the HSE should
develop specific runbooks and template
responses for specific scenarios to aid
a speedy response and ensure there is
consistent communication.

Analysis

FA3. KF17 The HSE lacked
skilled resources to respond
immediately to the Incident.
The HSE was reliant on third
party assistance.

FA3. KR17 (see strategic
recommendation 2.1 in Section
4.1) The HSE should ensure that an
appropriate response policy, plan, and
process are in place to manage multiple
security incidents, perform response
investigations, and collect evidence to
assess the best potential mitigation plan.

Mitigation

FA3. KF18 The HSE did
not have formal mitigation
strategies and tactics to
isolate, remove, and monitor
threats.

FA3. KR18 (see tactical
recommendation 3 in Section 4.2) The
HSE should develop formal mitigation
strategies and tactics to isolate, remove,
and monitor threats. Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) should be put in place so
that performance can be optimised.

Improvements

FA3. KF19 The HSE Incident
Management process did
not have formal processes to
ensure lessons were learnt
and codified from all incidents.

FA3. KR19 (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4.1) The
HSE should establish a formal process, as
well as resources to ensure lessons were
learnt and codified from all incidents and
are maintained to reflect operational and
organisational change.

Main recommendations

Recovery Planning

FA3. KF20 The HSE did not
have appropriate recovery
plans for cybersecurity
incidents. Clinical and services
continuity requirements are
not aligned to a formally
defined risk appetite
statement. Both contributed
to the initial recovery response
being focused on foundational
technology and not clinical
services.

FA3. KR20 (see strategic
recommendation 4.1 in Section 4.1) The
HSE should implement a cybersecurity
recovery plan that links to an asset
register detailing clinical, corporate, and
other priorities and test this plan on a
regular basis.

Improvements

FA3. KF21 The HSE should
formally document lessons
learnt from all cybersecurity
incidents to develop a
continuous improvement
methodology to manage any
future cybersecurity incident.

FA3. KR21 (see strategic
recommendation 1.1 in Section 4.1) The
HSE should develop a formal process for
capturing improvements/lessons learnt
following an incident.

Communications

FA3. KF22 The HSE’s internal
communications relating to
the cybersecurity incident
were ad-hoc and lacked an
appropriately resourced team
dedicated to manage the
message to the organisation.

FA3. KR22 (see strategic
recommendation 4.2 in Section 4.1)
The HSE should consider developing
a communications strategy for
cybersecurity incidents.

Initial

Focus area 3 conclusion
PwC’s NIST and COBIT based assessment of cybersecurity capability within the HSE clearly indicates that the
organisation is operating at a level of maturity that is reactive, ad-hoc and significantly below the level needed
to afford a basic level of protection against the rapidly increasing level of cyber threats that the organisation
faces. Despite efforts and endeavours at the time of the Incident, the HSE was not well prepared to identify,
understand, and respond to cybersecurity attacks. Significant gaps exist across all 5 NIST domains. The cyber
attack was not detected prior to the ransomware execution, protective controls and technologies were not
robust enough to prevent the spread of the ransomware. Furthermore, the response and recovery was based
on ad hoc structures, including processes to identify and prioritise applications and systems to be recovered.
Considerable resources and sustained investment will be required to remediate the gaps across all 5 NIST
domains. However, the recommendations herein, which are both tactical and strategic, will support the HSE to
safeguard and protect against future cyber attacks and will also significantly improve its cybersecurity maturity
ratings across all 5 domains of NIST.

A. Scope of work
Our work comprised three focus areas as follows:
•

Focus area 1: Review of the technical
investigation and response to the Conti Incident

•

Focus area 2: Review the organisation-wide
preparedness and strategic response

•

Focus area 3: Review the preparedness of the
HSE to manage cyber risks

Focus area 1
In this area, we reviewed the technical response
to the Incident and the subsequent recovery and
investigation activities undertaken by the HSE.
Key considerations included the effectiveness of
the response and recovery, the sufficiency of the
investigation to support the conclusions made, and
the ability of the HSE to detect and prevent similar
incidents in the future. To achieve this we separated
our review into nine phases - in each phase we did a
deep dive into specific areas of interest:
•

•

The first phase focused on Crisis Preparedness with
the following objectives:
•

Assess the governance in place at HSE for risk,
clinical and services continuity, incident and crisis
management;

•

Assess whether robust emergency, incident and
crisis plans were in place prior to the Incident at
strategic, tactical and operational level with clear
roles and responsibilities per team/stakeholder;

•

Assess whether robust BCM plans were in place
prior to the Incident at strategic, tactical and
operational level;

•

Assess whether crisis communications plans were
in place at HSE and CHO/hospital (group) level;

•

Understand the level of security and crisis
awareness, training and exercising pre-Incident;

•

Interviews with key stakeholders that were
involved in the response, investigation and
recovery to understand key information, including
preparedness, the timeline of events, roles and
responsibilities, and decision making;

Assess whether lessons learned from previous
large scale incidents or emergencies (e.g nurses’
strike, COVID-19 response) were applied to the
Conti response.

The second phase focused on Crisis Response with
the following objectives:

Interviews with contacts at the HSE’s Incident
Response provider to review their technical reporting;

•

Interviews with technical teams to understand
the Cyber Security controls that were in place at
the time of Incident and assess these against our
ransomware vulnerability framework;

•

Review of documentation and interviews to
understand HSE’s network and AD structure,
including the architecture of the NHN;

•

In this area, we reviewed the organisation-wide
preparedness and strategic response to the Incident.
The work comprised three phases as follows: Crisis
Preparedness, Crisis Response, and Crisis Recovery.

Review of relevant documentation including daily
incident SITREPs, investigation reports, RAID logs
and recovery plans;

•

•

Focus Area 2

A deep-dive into the recovery of specific
applications and organisations, including
statutory hospitals, voluntary hospitals and CHOs,
including the adequacy of disaster recovery
capabilities to contribute to operational readiness
for a cyber attack;
Review of Cyber Security improvements planned
or implemented during the Incident to assess
whether they would likely prevent a similar
Incident reoccurring.

103 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

•

Assess whether effective and organised response
structures were defined and implemented, when
and by whom;

•

Identify whether an effective operating rhythm,
matching the pace of the crisis, was set and
followed to ensure command, control and
coordination was continuously achieved
throughout the response;

•

Identify whether information and data was shared
effectively across workstreams and up to the HSE
NCMT to inform understanding of clinical and
operational impacts;

•

Assess whether leadership established an agreed
overarching response and recovery strategy,
guided by clear values and response principles;

•

Assess whether decisions were made effectively
based on a situational assessment;

•

Understand the impact of the prevailing HSE
emergency response culture on the crisis response.
© 2021 PwC. All rights reserved.

The third phase focused on Crisis Recovery with the
following objectives:
•

Assess whether leadership established a recovery
strategy/plan;

•

Assess whether recovery plan was aligned with
existing clinical and services continuity, disaster
recovery and risk management processes;

•

Determined if there were organisational, cultural
or behavioural root causes in the IT areas that
could be identified so that we could provide an
informed view on the improvements the HSE
should consider to improve its Cyber Security
posture and prevent similar Incidents occurring
again.

Scope exclusions

•

Assess whether business/corporate/clinical
priorities drove recovery plan;

•

We did not perform validation of the
documentation provided to us.

•

Determine the extent to which workarounds
implemented at local hospital, HGO and CHO
level were appropriate; and how this ability was
impacted based on organisational preparedness
and culture;

•

We did not conduct any testing of the operating
effectiveness of controls.

•

Understand the long term impacts of the event on
clinical activities, operations and staff wellbeing;

During our historic review of the Incident and
HSE’s structure, processes and infrastructure, the
maximum period we looked back is five years.

•

Understand the planned changes in processes
and culture driven by this event and how they
align with HSE’s organisational strategy.

As the remediation work was ongoing during our
review, we analysed the activity that had taken
place up to 31 July 2021.

•

We have performed a cyber preparedness
assessment based on PwC’s NIST CSF and
COBIT Frameworks. We conducted this review
based on the ten key areas we identified,
using the above Frameworks. We note that an
organisation-wide NIST assessment has not been
fully completed to date by the HSE.

•

We have not validated the work performed as
part of any previous information security audits or
related work on which the HSE historically made
decisions.

•

•

Focus area 3
In this area, we conducted a review of the HSE’s
current cyber security capabilities from a strategic
and operational perspective. Our objective
was to determine the level of preparedness in
the HSE’s technical capability and operational
resilience (including clinical and services continuity
management planning) in terms of managing
cybersecurity risk. To do this, we:
•

Examined the appropriateness of any technical
controls implemented and the likelihood
they would prevent this or a similar Incident
reoccurring. Specifically, in the area of Identity
and Access Management, Data Protection and
Content Control;

•

We have only reviewed how the HSE’s strategy
was informed by advice provided by third parties
and how the HSE’s response strategy allowed
for effective coordination of third parties. We
reviewed the effectiveness of third parties’
response and recovery efforts.

•

Assessed IT response in terms of how it
empowered the organisation-wide response and,
the structuring and management of the recovery
of applications supporting key patient care
services in the HSE, hospitals, and CHOs;

•

While we have identified learnings from this
Incident which may apply to other major risks
and incidents that could cause major business
disruption to the HSE, we have not performed a
full evaluation of other risks that HSE may face.

•

Assessed if lessons learnt have been
implemented from this and other incidents, and
have these been shared with State and non-State
organisations to inform future preparedness;

•

While we have reviewed the HSE’s clinical
and services continuity plans, structures and
processes; the scope of our review did not
include preparing a new clinical and services
continuity plan.

D. List of key recommendations
Figure 20: List of key recommendations
Ref #

Recommendation description

FA1.KR1

Appoint an interim senior leader for cybersecurity (a CISO) who has experience rapidly reducing
organisations vulnerability to threats and designing cyber security transformation programmes.
The HSE should appoint an interim senior leader for cybersecurity to be responsible for placing
governance around cybersecurity improvements, identifying a sustainable medium-term managed
detection and response solution (see immediate recommendation FA1.KR6), identifying future
strategy for detection and response and leading the implementation of the tactical recommendations
from this review. This role should also be responsible for planning and mobilising teams to deliver a
cybersecurity transformation required to sustainably reduce the HSE’s risk to ransomware attacks. The
CISO should be at National Director level, a direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate access to
the Executive Management Team and their agenda, to ensure that cybersecurity risks are understood
and considered in all decision-making. This interim senior leader should be given the ability to
source the necessary expertise from the market to build a team that can give effect to the immediate
recommendations listed in this section, and to begin planning for the implementation of medium-term
recommendations. The prioritisation for the approval of a CISO and a cyber security team has been
recorded within the Q2 DRR as an ‘action control’ to Risk ID 130 with a due date of 30 June 2022.

FA1.KR2

Establish an executive-level cybersecurity oversight committee, to drive continuous assessment
of cybersecurity risk across the provision of health services.
A dedicated executive oversight committee is needed to provide direction and oversight to
cybersecurity, both within the HSE and across other parties connected to the NHN.

FA1.KR3

Create a Board committee, to oversee the transformation of IT and cybersecurity to deliver a
future-fit, resilient technology base for provision of digitally-enabled health services.
The HSE should consider inclusion of further specialist non-executive members of the committee in
order to provide additional expertise and insight to the committee.

FA1.KR4

Plan a multi-year cybersecurity transformation programme, and identify and mobilise the
resources to deliver.
In parallel to delivering tactical cybersecurity improvements, the HSE’s appointed interim CISO should
plan a cybersecurity transformation that will build lasting cybersecurity capabilities and sustainably
reduce cyber risk exposure. This cybersecurity transformation programme should be validated at the
Board level. For more details on how this should be structured see recommendation FA1: 4.2.7 in
section 4.0 Recommendations. The HSE should also identify suitable resources and expertise to plan
and deliver this transformation.

FA1.KR5

Appoint a programme lead and define governance framework for the cybersecurity
transformation programme.
A programme lead with experience in cybersecurity transformation should be appointed by the HSE’s
interim CISO to drive the execution of this transformation. It is critical that this programme lead can
work hand in glove with the HSE’s technologies teams, to help orchestrate secure technological
transformation. The programme lead should have a direct reporting line into the CISO and have a
dotted line into the CIO and be able to provide updates on the programme’s progress to the Board
committee that oversees cybersecurity.

FA1.KR6

Continue to use a managed detection and response service provided by a third party and
identify a sustainable medium-term solution.
The current service provided by HSE’s Incident Response provider is the most crucial defence the HSE
has against further ransomware attacks. If the HSE decides to onboard a new managed detection and
response service, it should ensure there is an overlap between this and the HSE’s Incident Response
provider’s current service, so that there are no periods when the IT environment is not monitored.

Recommendation description

FA1.KR7

Mobilise a tactical cybersecurity improvement programme (while the cybersecurity
transformation programme is being planned), with governance that feeds into the interim CISO
and can provide updates on the programme’s progress into the Board committee.
Dedicated cybersecurity and technology resources should be used to deliver a tactical cybersecurity
improvement programme, consisting of tactical work packages that can be delivered at pace using
focused governance and reporting to drive accountability. To create these work packages, the HSE
should action the following activities:
•

Triage - All third party recommendations and fixes to the security control gaps identified internally
should be triaged into tactical or strategic activities. Tactical activities should be those that will
rapidly reduce the risk of ransomware attacks and are achievable in 60 days or less. Note that
where improvements are identified as strategic, the HSE should consider what additional tactical
improvements can be implemented in the short-term to reduce risk and act as mitigating controls.

•	
Test and Assess - As well as the recommendations it has received from third parties, the HSE

should also include recommendations by performing:
o	AD security assessments;
	
o	Vulnerability scanning of all internet-facing IP addresses;
	
o	Vulnerability scanning of all internal IP address ranges; and,
	
o	A comprehensive assessment of current capabilities and planned improvements against a
	
framework that identifies key capabilities to defend against human-operated ransomware
attacks (such as the proprietary ransomware readiness framework used in this report or that
recently published by CISA325).

•

Architect - Following the triaging activity, the HSE should use cybersecurity experts to architect
and manage a series of tactical work packages to deliver the tactical improvements identified
by the triage process. These should be designed to deliver directly and rapidly reduce the risk of
ransomware attacks, and be achievable in 60 days or less. Examples of tactical work packages
include:

o	Uplift detection and response capability;
	
o	Remediate priority infrastructure vulnerabilities;
	
o	Lock down remote access methods;
	
o	Protect privileged accounts;
	
o	Improve service account hygiene;
	
o	Remediate AD hygiene issues;
	
o	Secure local administrator accounts;
	
o	Enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for all remote access methods; and,
	
o	Restrict internet access to servers.
	

This governance should directly feed progress updates into the Board committee. These progress
updates should clearly articulate:
•	the HSE’s vulnerability to ransomware attacks;
•	the risk reduction achieved by improvement activities that have been delivered; and,
•	the extent of the improvements required to reduce the risk of ransomware attacks to

an acceptable level.

Recommendation description

FA1.KR8

Bring the governance of ongoing IT and cybersecurity improvement projects under the tactical
cybersecurity improvement programme.
Governance of current on-going IT projects, that directly or indirectly result in cyber risk reduction,
should be brought under the tactical cybersecurity improvement programme’s governance
(and therefore the CISO see key recommendation FA1.KR7), so the cyber risk reduction they deliver
can be tracked, and any risk and issues can be resolved. For example, modernisation projects such
as the upgrading of Windows 7 OS and platform modernisation.

FA1.KR9

Use security testing ‘find and fix’ to identify additional security weaknesses and vulnerabilities
by simulating cyber attack techniques, before identifying and triaging pragmatic fixes.
Security testing should be used to focus tactical improvement activities. By simulating the threat of
human-operated ransomware attacks, improvements that make it more difficult for a threat actor to
successfully compromise the organisation can be identified. The HSE should bring together red team
experts and cybersecurity engineers to identify pragmatic fixes to the vulnerabilities and weaknesses
identified. These fixes should then be triaged with IT and Security teams to assess feasibility and
identify how best to deliver them (see key recommendation FA1.KR7 Triage). Security testing should
then be used to validate improvements have been correctly implemented.

FA1.KR10

Schedule a ‘red team’ ethical hacking exercise for early 2022 to demonstrate the effectiveness
of tactical improvements made and identify areas for further improvement.
The HSE’s interim CISO should schedule a red team for Q1 2022 to simulate a human-operated
ransomware attack from end-to-end, to identify whether improvements have been effective, and to
identify additional priority and focus areas for cybersecurity improvements. This should be scheduled
in addition to the recorded plans within the Q2 DRR, which recorded an ‘action control’ to enhance
penetration testing and red team exercises with a due date of 31 December 2021.

Ref #

Recommendation description

FA1.KR11

Implement the following tactical recommendations identified through this review, within the
mobilised tactical cybersecurity improvement programme (see key recommendation FA1.KR7).
a.

Improve security monitoring capability

	i.	Document a process for how to respond to cybersecurity alerts, that clearly outlines how
alerts should be triaged, investigated, contained and responded to. This process should also
include coordinating the response to security alerts and incidents raised by any organisations
connected to the NHN.
	ii.	Augment the Security Operations team with cybersecurity expertise.
b.

Secure privileged access

	i.	Develop and implement a robust privileged access strategy that aligns with Microsoft
good practice and reduces the risk of privileged accounts being compromised.
c.

Build a vulnerability management capability

	i.	Stand up a vulnerability management capability that continuously scans for vulnerabilities that
can be exploited by attackers.
d.

Harden the security boundary

	i.	Define and communicate a ‘security boundary’ for the HSE to provide a clear boundary of
cybersecurity responsibilities.
	ii.	Perform hardening activities on the defined perimeter of the HSE.
	iii.	Identify secure methods for clinical staff in voluntary hospitals to access applications hosted
by the HSE.
	iv.	Use security testing to validate that the HSE can not be compromised by malicious activity
from outside its security boundary.
e.

Improve governance over the NHN

	i.	Risk assess the ‘flat’ network design and implement segmentation controls that align to
the defined level of risk appetite.
	ii.	Establish clear responsibilities for IT and cybersecurity across all parties that connect to the
NHN, or share health data, or access shared health services.
	iii.	Increase the resourcing of first and second line network teams in line with defined security
responsibilities.
	iv.	Define a security code of connection for connecting to the NHN.
v.	Define a minimum security standard for the networking of medical devices.
f.

Improve preparedness for a ransomware attack

	i.	Collect, organise and document artefacts created as part of the response and recovery
to the ransomware cyber attack.
	ii.	Identify documents required to respond to a ransomware attack (e.g., network diagrams,
asset list) and secure these in a cloud repository. This should be aligned with work to develop
an IT continuity and recoverability process which was recorded in the Q2 DRR as an ‘action
control’ with a due date of 30 September 2021326.
	iii.	Setup and test out-of-band communication medium that would enable IT and security teams,
as well as employees, to communicate in the event of a cybersecurity incident.
	iv.	Ensure that the HSE has a fit-for-purpose incident response service with complementing and
embedded internal processes for its invocation.
	v.	Review backups and plan for a wide-spread failure recovery mode.
	vi.	Document a prioritised list of applications for recovery.

326

DRR Q2 2021, 19 November 2020

113 | PwC Independent Post Incident Review 2021

g.

Accelerate foundational IT projects

	i.	Accelerate the move to cloud based email
and cybersecurity improvements programmes.

by prioritising the resources available for IT

	ii.	Prioritise the remediation of critical legacy systems. Particular attention should be paid to the
NIMIS application to understand whether the configuration changes made in one hospital
(Hospital A) to enable the application to run on Windows 10 can be more widely implemented
to expedite the central Windows 10 rollout plans. It should be noted that a legacy risk was
recorded in the Q2 DRR, with an aligned ‘action controls’ to risk assess the existing estate
and increase investment
for replacing outdated structures both with due dates of 31 December 2021327.
	iii.	Define a minimum standard for legacy operating systems. For systems who must run on
outdated operating systems, sufficient mitigation measures must be defined.
	iv.	Define minimum standard requirements for OS of medical devices.
v.	Perform asset discovery activities to continually update asset lists.
FA1.KR12

Appoint suitable long-term senior leadership for cybersecurity (a CISO) and establish a suitably
resourced and skilled central cybersecurity function.
The CISO should be at National Director level, a direct report to the CTTO, and have appropriate
access to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure that cybersecurity risks are understood and considered
in all decision-making. They should be empowered to execute on a defined security vision, strategy
and transformation to achieve sustainable cybersecurity risk reduction across the HSE. In line with this
appointment the cybersecurity governance and operating model should be defined and subsequently
resourced (ideally with burst capacity resources used during any interim periods that occur while
recruitment takes place). This model should align to the three line of defence model. Responsibilities,
accountabilities, reporting lines and resourcing across the extended organisation of the HSE must
all be defined. This includes within the HSE’s cybersecurity and IT teams and between these central
teams and those within its extended organisation

Recommendation description

FA1.KR13

Deliver a multi-year cybersecurity transformation programme to build defence in depth over
time and address root-cause issues.
Investment is needed in a single programme of work delivered over the next two - four years to
develop core cybersecurity capabilities in a sustainable manner over the short, mid and long term.
We would propose this transformation is structured according to a two-track delivery model with
dedicated resources and defined target states:
a.	Tactical track - the HSE should bring together red team experts and cybersecurity engineers to
identify pragmatic fixes to the vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified. These should then be
triaged between this tactical track and the strategic track for any longer term strategic activities.
Within the tactical track each activity should be defined as being deliverable within either ‘twoweek agile sprints’ or ‘60-days work packages’, to deliver rapid risk reduction by addressing
exposure to specific attack techniques. Once the cybersecurity transformation programme is
operational this track should absorb the tactical cybersecurity improvement programme.
b.	Strategic track - To build the sustainable and enabling foundations that deliver long-term
reduction and mitigation of cyber risk, the HSE should define strategic work packages for
activities that will take longer than 60 days to implement. This will include the medium to longterm recommendations made in this report. For improvements that are identified to be delivered
strategically, suitable mitigations should be put in place in the short-term to reduce risk.
Figure 21: Overview of key pillars in a cybersecurity transformation. This identifies elements
that should be considered when scoping a cybersecurity transformation programme.
IT Foundations

Security Foundations

Access Management

Improving the hygiene of an
organisation’s IT estate through

For example, within the ‘IT Foundations’ work stream tactical work packages might include the
remediation of stale data or extending the scope of the identity directory. Strategic work packages
within this work stream could include decommissioning end of life systems or implementing an
operational CMDB to maintain an updated list of all systems and applications in the environment.
FA1.KR14

Plan the HSE’s future IT transformation that reduces cybersecurity risk.
The HSE’s IT transformation lead should begin documenting and planning the HSE’s future IT
transformation. Executing an IT transformation will allow the HSE to sustainably reduce cybersecurity
risk in the long-term, as it can address issues within the HSE’s legacy IT estate and therefore can build
cybersecurity and resilience into the IT architecture.

Recommendation description

FA1.KR15

Design and implement a single and centralised security monitoring capability for the defined
security boundary of the HSE that reports into the CISO.
This should be for all monitoring aspects including network, server and workstation environments,
as well as services such as email. Any reduction in the visibility of assets for monitoring should be
risk-assessed to ensure that the HSE’s ability to monitor its full environment is within risk appetite.
This implementation should involve establishing the following across the three fundamental pillars of
people, process and technology:

FA2.KR1.1

•

People - Employing security monitoring and detection SMEs (either internally or through third
parties) that are trained to identify and respond to threats detected within and across the HSE
security boundary.

•

Process - Ensuring that detection and response processes are documented. This includes
incident playbooks that outline the step-by-step response actions to be taken, as well as
documented responsibilities and accountabilities for reporting security events between
organisations (such as voluntary hospitals and reporting bodies like the NCSC).

•

Tooling - Deployment of modern endpoint detection and response tooling/endpoint protection
platform tooling across the HSE environment and security boundary. This should be in addition
to the implementation of a Security Incident and Event Manager (SIEM) and Security Operations
Centre (SOC) to centrally analyse logs from systems and security tools.

Establish governance and oversight of Operational Resilience Programme.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR1.2

•

 ominate an executive with responsibility for operational resilience which will include the
N
coordination of component parts of crisis management (including major emergency management),
incident management, clinical and services continuity and enterprise risk management; and

•

 stablish a HSE Resilience SteerCo to oversee the design and delivery of an Operational
E
Resilience Programme, reporting into the Board. This SteerCo should include senior
representatives from the EMT who own the respective resilience disciplines and related functions
(e.g. cyber security) and any additional key clinical and services and operations representatives.

Establish an Operational Resilience Policy and Programme scope, strategy and structure.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR1.3

•

 efine an overarching policy that incorporates the above resilience disciplines. Clarify ownership
D
of the programme (for example under the ND G&R) and integration with existing policies. At a
minimum, the policy should include a statement of leadership commitment, objectives and scope,
roles and responsibilities, reference to relevant industry standards and an oversight regime;

•

 efine the Operational Resilience Programme scope, strategy and structure across the HSE and
D
funded entities. Define the types of incidents in scope (e.g. physical, technological, people and
cyber incidents) and how to build and maintain a capability to respond across the organisation.
Define the operating model or the capability in terms of dedicated staff, reporting lines, roles and
responsibilities within ‘prepare’ and ‘respond and recover.’ Specify which areas of the HSE and
funded entities are included and identify accountable teams/individuals for delivering specific
components of the programme. Agree the intended end state, the timetable to achieve the
objectives and the resources required; and

•

 esign consistent tools and templates to be used by the HSE and to be cascaded down as
D
resources for funded entities. Assign responsible leads to complete these tools and templates,
and develop documentation and capability at operational sites.

Establish assurance over the Operational Resilience Programme.
The HSE should:
•

 evelop programme reporting, including KPIs, a method and timetable for review, and risk
D
management considerations. Ensure that operational resilience is a standing agenda at Board
(or Board committee) meetings

•

 nsure ND G&R and at least one Board member has direct competency/experience in the area of
E
operational resilience.

Establish and document a formal governance structure to oversee clinical and services
continuity in the HSE.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR2.2

•

 pdate the existing Clinical and Services Continuity Policy and present it to the Board for
U
review and approval. This should be nested under the overarching Operational Resilience Policy
(see recommendation FA2.KR1) and clearly articulate the purpose, scope, applicability, review
frequency, authority, Clinical and Services Continuity Management Framework, governance and
monitoring of the policy and programme;

•

 stablish a programme of governance for clinical and services continuity - incorporated under the
E
Operational Resilience Programme (see recommendation FA2.KR1.1) - which provides a central
point of accountability for the implementation, maintenance, monitoring and validation of activities
in line with policy objectives. Formally document roles and responsibilities, a Clinical and Services
Continuity Steering Committee and an organisational chart. The scope should reference the HSE
and all funded entities;

•

 ormalise robust review and challenge by appropriate personnel, of all stages of the Clinical and
F
Services Continuity Programme, embedding Internal Audit into the clinical and services continuity
lifecycle to provide independent assurance to the Board of the HSE’s contingency capabilities;

•

 ecure formal clinical and services continuity qualifications for appropriate members of the
S
steering committee/implementation team;

•

 e prepared to consider the emerging requirements contained in the EU Critical Entities Resilience
B
Directive (CER).

Support funded entities (hospital groups, hospitals and CHOs) to establish governance over
clinical and services continuity.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR3.1

•

Implement a Clinical and Services Continuity Steering Sub-Committee at HG, hospital and CHO
levels, beneath the HSE Steering Committee; and establish a framework of governance. These
groups should have a similar structure, terms of reference and roles and responsibilities as the
overarching HSE group;

•

 raft a specific Clinical and Services Continuity Policy which complements the HSE’s policy,
D
according to the policy guidance listed above;

•

Appoint a relevant clinical and services continuity sponsor;

•

Integrate clinical and services continuity into project and change management processes where
appropriate.

Establish and embed a clear and consistent approach to clinical and services impact analysis
across the HSE to inform recovery prioritisation.
The HSE should:
•

 stablish and embed a formal clinical and services impact analysis process, with clear ownership
E
at each level, including the criteria for the RTO and RPO; and,

•

 nsure the results of the clinical and services impact analysis are formally reviewed and approved
E
on a periodic basis, by senior management, and following any significant systems/process,
operational, regulatory or personnel change.

Design clinical and services continuity workarounds, based on the clinical and services impact
analysis, to enable the HSE to continue providing critical services while responding to an
incident or crisis.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR4

•

 esign and agree clinical and services continuity workarounds, for critical processes, with the
D
agility and governance to be maintained for a prolonged period, and based on the Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis;

•

 ssess all workarounds to ensure they do not pose an unacceptable risk to patient care or to the
A
HSE through the transfer of data or other assets between systems;

•

 lign workarounds for similar systems or processes across the HSE to improve their effectiveness
A
and inform a consistent response;

•

Reflect the workarounds in the relevant Clinical and Services Continuity Plan.

Develop and embed consistent Clinical and Services Continuity Plans at strategic, tactical
and operational levels that align with the clinical and services business impact analysis.
To ensure that clinical and services continuity plans are compatible with the HSE recovery objectives,
the HSE should:

FA2.KR5.1

•

Implement Clinical and Services Continuity Plans at strategic, tactical and operational levels of
the HSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs and that they formally document workarounds and the steps
involved to resume normal operations;

•

 enchmark the Clinical and Services Continuity Plan construction against ISO 22331, and ensure
B
they are compatible with future Sláintecare objectives;

•

Incorporate the testing of these steps into the clinical and services continuity management
training and exercising schedule/programme (e.g. through desktop walkthrough of the resumption
procedures to identify any gaps or unforeseen dependencies); and

•

 nsure soft and hard copies of Clinical and Services Continuity Plans are available
E
in appropriate areas.

Design an end-to-end Crisis Management Framework (integrated with the existing MEM and IM
Frameworks) and overseen by the HSE Resilience Steering Group (see also finding FA2.KR1.1).
The HSE should review the existing incident and emergency management structures, and the
structures established during the attack and other recent events (e.g. COVID-19), to establish a new
integrated end-to-end organisation-wide Crisis Management Framework that is fit-for-purpose across
a wide variety of crisis types. This Framework should incorporate all resilience disciplines responsible
for implementing organisational preparedness activities (e.g. emergency/incident/crisis response, and
clinical and services continuity management), and identify accountable teams/individuals for specific
components, as well as define all levels of response required during an actual event at strategic,
tactical and operational levels. It should also integrate with the relevant elements of the organisationwide Major Emergency Management and Incident Management Frameworks.
The Framework should include the following elements:
•

 ierarchy of teams required for response. Typically this will include three layers - operational,
H
tactical and strategic - with command and control escalating according to the nature and severity
of the Incident;

•

 efined roles and responsibilities, and decision making authority, for all those involved in the
D
identification, escalation, response to and management of incidents;

•

Escalation thresholds and formalised communication channels;

•

 uidance on how and when to invoke response structure in line with the Incident Classification
G
and Severity Matrix (see also finding FA2.KF14);

•

Agreed touchpoints and interaction between the HSE, and HGs and CHOs;

•

 ools and templates to be used by all responders (across the HSE, HG and CHO levels) during an
T
incident (e.g., situation report, classification and severity matrix, impact assessment, decision and
action logs).

FA2.KR5.2

Design a suite of crisis response plans and procedures to underpin the Crisis Management
Framework.
The HSE should design:

FA2.KR6

•

 Crisis Management Plan providing detailed roles and responsibilities for key positions in the
A
NCMT and supporting tactical teams (e.g. HG/hospital and CHO leadership), including checklists
of activities and considerations, and details of third party support available;

•

 Technical/Operational Coordination Guide providing the details of how the technical (e.g. IT
A
Ops) and operational teams (e.g. clinical response teams) would coordinate and work together.
This includes detailed roles and responsibilities, information flows, processes, checklists of key
activities and considerations and details of third party support available;

•

 cenario-specific plans providing detailed step-by-step operational guides for specific scenarios
S
(e.g. analyst response to malware, fire response plan). The HSE should, using the risks identified
in the Corporate Risk Register, conduct a threat profile review and readiness assessment to
determine high likelihood, high impact scenarios and create scenario-specific plans for response.
This should include severe but plausible total loss scenarios;

•

 unctional Response Plans providing detailed function-specific guidance for non-technical teams,
F
for example a Legal/Regulatory Team and Communications Team (see recommendation FA2.KR7);
and

•

 ite-Specific Response Plans templates and guidance, providing resources for standardised
S
clinical and services continuity and crisis management planning at sites across the organisation.

Ensure that the resources assigned to internal communications are sufficient.
An effective internal communications team is critical to disseminate information and guidance to
all 130,000 HSE staff all operating across different levels of the response; this requires additional
resources and staff to what is currently available. As part of their future crisis management planning,
the HSE should assess the requirements of their crisis response communications strategy and allocate
the resources necessary to grow the internal communications team, to reflect the HSE’s current
operational architecture, and taking into consideration the impacted and involved stakeholder base.

FA2.KR7

Document the Communications Team’s existing response structures, processes, tools and
templates in a Crisis Communications Plan.
The HSE should document a formal Crisis Communications Plan to ensure consistent and efficient
communications management across the organisation during an incident/crisis, and to guide the
actions of new members of the HSE’s communications team.

FA2.KR8.1

•

 he communications team should document the response processes, tools and templates, and
T
structures they have found most effective during previous incidents, ensuring the resulting plan
dovetails into any existing Major Emergency and Crisis Management Plans and processes, in line
with the Crisis Management Framework (see also finding FA2.KF5);

T
Communications Plans in place at the HGs and CHOs to ensure the structures and processes
involved integrate effectively;

 nce finalised, all processes and templates, especially those requiring collaboration with other
O
HSE teams, should be socialised and ratified to ensure they are fit for purpose and based on
up-to-date information; and

•

 he Crisis Communications Plan should be reviewed regularly to confirm the content is still
T
correct and relevant, and to incorporate any lessons learnt from new incidents.

Establish a formal training and exercising programme in support of the Operational Resilience
Programme (see also Finding FA2.KF1).
The HSE should:
•

 nsure this programme incorporates clinical and services continuity and crisis management
E
requirements and that all relevant individuals and teams involved at every level of the HSE
become familiar with their roles and responsibilities in a crisis or significant clinical and services
continuity incident; and

•

 nsure it is aligned to ISO 22398 Security and resilience - Guidelines for exercising and testing.

Deliver training to staff in key responsible and supporting roles, and new managers.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR8.3

•

 rovide Clinical and services continuity and crisis management training for staff in key responsible
P
and supporting roles. Such staff should have knowledge of best practice in relation to each core
element of an effective integrated command centre and of an effective Clinical and Services
Continuity Management Programme including: risk assessment,Clinical and Services Impact
Analysis, clinical and services continuity management strategy selection, plan testing techniques
and processes for assessing effectiveness of plans; and

•

Include clinical and services continuity awareness training for new managers.

Conduct annual exercises to rehearse the operational resilience capability.
The HSE should:

FA2.KR9

•

 onduct annual crisis management and clinical and services continuity desktop or simulation
C
exercises with the NCMT and ensure scenarios extend beyond current focus to include other
loss scenarios including loss/denial of mission critical infrastructure, unavailability of key persons,
systems, processes and facilities;

•

 onduct annual multi-team crisis management and clinical and services exercises involving key
C
HSE functions (e.g. support services) and funded entities; increasing in complexity over time to
continually build organisation-wide maturity and capability; and

•

 upport the nominated responsible owner with responsibility for clinical and services continuity
S
and crisis management to acquire relevant external training to maintain the currency of their
expertise.

Review and refine the post-incident review process to ensure ongoing and continuous
improvement of the response capability.
Formal and consistent post-incident reviews should be conducted following all incidents or near
misses to capture both areas of positive performance and opportunities for improvement. The
Operational Resilience Steering Group should ensure that all post incident reviews are reported
centrally to enable learnings to be disseminated across the HSE and funded entities (see also finding
FA2.KF1). Mitigating actions should be assigned a responsible owner and tracked centrally until their
completion. The process should be reflected in the end-to-end Crisis Management Framework (see
recommendation FA2.KR5.1).

FA2.KR10

Instil a culture of preparedness in the HSE to reduce the negative impacts of disruption on its
people.
The HSE should aim to create a culture that values and emphasises crisis preparedness as well as
having confidence in natural ability to respond to major emergencies. In addition to scenario-specific
plans to prepare for crisis scenarios (beyond the current scope of floods, adverse weather and
aviation disasters) recommended below (see also findings FA2.KF8 and FA2.KF21), the HSE should
implement a comprehensive training and exercising programme to familiarise all crisis responders
at operational (e.g. hospital/CHO, business support services, IT Security, etc.), tactical (e.g. HSE,
regional/area CMTs), and strategic (e.g. HSE NCMT) levels with their roles and responsibilities for
crisis preparedness and response, as well as the unique key considerations and decisions required
in various crisis scenarios (see also finding FA2.KF8). Conducting scenario-based desktop and
simulation exercises will expose individuals to the (simulated) pressures they will experience, thereby
reducing the negative impact imposed by external stressors and uncertainty in real life events.
Transferring the skills gained in psychologically realistic exercises will facilitate more effective
teamwork and decision making in actual crisis situations when they occur.

Design and implement an integrated notification and escalation process and acquire a means of
mass notification to all HSE staff and contractors.

FA2.KR12

•

 he HSE should implement a uniform and integrated notification and escalation process within
T
the updated end-to-end response framework, supported by an Incident Classification and
Severity Matrix and an ‘Activation Membership’ list detailing the stakeholders to be informed,
across all levels of response, depending on the severity rating of that incident. This will allow
critical responders to be notified of an event and convene at pace to instigate a response at the
appropriate level to any incident or crisis impacting its operations or services; and

•

 he HSE should review whether the use of mobile phone network providers as a method of
T
sending ‘blast notifications’ meets the required functionality for mass notification and, if not,
should consider investing in a mass emergency notification and communications tool to improve
its wider incident notification capability. The solution should include features for notifying all
HSE staff members and contractors or smaller groups of staff about any serious incident,
crisis or clinical and services continuity event (e.g., a data leak where formal notification and
information needs to be disclosed with impacted persons, physical or medical events requiring
safety instructions to be issued, or a total system outage/ransomware attack). Clear authority
should be designated to an individual or individuals with an appropriate level of authority to send
communications from this platform, to ensure all messages are consistent and have been signed
off by the appropriate parties (e.g. legal).

Establish a Crisis Situation Centre to manage an organisation-wide response to a crisis (see
also recommendation FA2.KR5).
As part of the Crisis Management Framework (see recommendation FA2.KR5.1), the HSE should
establish a Crisis Situation Centre construct to be stood up during a crisis response. This should
incorporate the learnings from the Situation Centre introduced by the Defence Forces during the Conti
response and include the following elements: Guidance on how and when it should be invoked in line
with the Incident Classification and Severity Matrix (see also recommendation FA2.KR14);

FA2.KR13

•

The hierarchy of teams required;

•

 ools and templates to be used by all responders (across the HSE, HG and CHO levels) during an
T
incident (e.g., situation report, classification and severity matrix, impact assessment, decision and
action logs).

Establish formal retainers with key third parties that may be required to support a crisis
response.
The HSE should consider the third party support that may be required during an incident include:
crisis response, external legal counsel and public relations. These retainers should include service
level agreements, clear descriptions of third party roles and responsibilities, and pre-agreed legal
requirements (such as non-disclosure agreements) to ensure partners can be engaged to support, and
be integrated into, a response immediately and scale to the size of the response required.
Work should be conducted with third parties providing technical support to familiarise them with the
HSE’s IT network, architecture and systems, to facilitate quicker engagement during an incident. The
role of retained third parties should be reflected in response plans or playbooks and they should be
involved in regular cross-organisation conversations and training exercises with the HSE, the HGs and
CHOs to rehearse efficient coordination and communication flows.

Recommendation description

FA2.KR15

Designate and train incident information managers (or coordinators) at all levels across an
incident or crisis response to maintain a consistent overview of the situation as it develops.
Further to recommendation FA2.KR12, the HSE should ensure that each workstream beneath the
SITCEN, at every command level and workstream, has aniInformation manager (or coordinator)
appointed as part of the Incident response team. This role should be implemented in all local hospital
response teams, Regional/Area CMTs, and within each HSE workstream up to the NCMT. As the
information manager completes their expected role (digesting all information to gain a view of the endto-end incident), they should escalate their status and update upwards (as with the SITREPs). This will
allow the SITCEN information manager to articulate one consolidated account of events, decisions
and actions which will achieve situational awareness across all teams and parties involved.
To embed this capability the HSE should train those who have been assigned the role of information
manager and complete multi-team exercises to rehearse information sharing between teams to
maintain situational awareness. Templates created as a result of the ransomware attack should be
further developed and embedded into scenario-specific response plans, in order to support the
information managers in their role. This structure and format should be used in all teams and work
streams to maintain consistency.

FA2.KR16

Identify and acquire a secure and resilient ‘out-of-band’ technology solution to ensure an
alternative means of information sharing and communication.
The HSE should ensure that the platform can facilitate email, file sharing, call hosting and the
dissemination of communications to all staff and segmented audiences, and enable all responders to
see situations reports, actions and decisions logs and other information necessary to support a shared
understanding of the Incident.

FA2.KR17

Ensure the ‘higher organisational intent’ is aligned to the organisational values and drives the
response and recovery strategy; review the strategy regularly throughout the response as the
situation develops.
In this incident, the strategic priority was the restoration and protection of systems underpinning
patient care services. The HSE should ensure that all incident response strategies consider both the
technical and business response priorities, and be informed by the impacts and requirements of the
hospitals, HGs and CHO, to ensure they are fit for purpose.
Patient care may not always be restricted to the maintenance of healthcare systems; the possible
implications of patient data exposure should be considered in conjunction with discussions on patient
care, and incorporated into the HSE’s strategic intent during a response. Consideration should be
given to how this strategy is cascaded to all levels of the organisation, to direct the actions of the
tactical and operational response teams (see finding FA2.KF19) and to inform the activities of third
party support.
The response strategy should be reviewed regularly during a response based on new information
and circumstances to ensure it is still valid and appropriate. the development and implementation
of a response strategy should be a key focus during crisis exercising, as this will facilitate a single
consistent approach to response and recovery activities.

FA2.KR18

Agree delineated decision making authority across all teams in the organisation likely to be
involved in an organisation-wide incident.
The HSE should establish an organisational crisis management structure, incorporating hospitals,
HGs, CHOs and contracted third parties, which clearly defines the decision making authority at each
level. This structure should be socialised and embedded as part of a regular training and exercising
programme for all responders (see finding FA2.KR8.3) to ensure it meets the different priorities of all
parties and remains fit for purpose. Additional training should be provided for the HSE, HG and CHO
leadership to support them in:
•

creating a shared situational awareness across multiple sites or locations;

•

 eveloping effective communication flows between senior leadership across multiple sites or
d
locations; and

•

 stablishing clear decision making and delegated authority for senior leadership across multiple
e
sites or locations.

Critical stakeholders or response team members at every level should therefore receive
communication about, and be trained and exercised in, the predefined response structures to ensure
the hooks and handovers within every level of the command model is understood and seamless during
an incident.

Recommendation description

FA2.KR19

Familiarise the Internal Communications Team with the ‘out of band’ technology solution to
enable focused and targeted communications during a crisis (see also recommendation FA2.
KR16).
The HSE should set up user accounts for all staff members pre-incident on the selected ‘out of band’
communication platform to expedite transition to the new platform during a system outage. Staff
members should be familiarised with the platform and its functionality ahead of an incident. Details
for all alternative user accounts should be recorded centrally and stored offline to ensure contact
information for all staff members is readily available during any disruption to the HSE’s standard
communications channels. Crisis response and communications workstream leads should establish
cascading contact trees to notify staff of an incident, to initiate the use of the out of band platform,
and to enact specific channels for the discussion of response and recovery activities between core
responders. This will allow workstreams to maintain a central repository of useful information and act
as an audit trail for post incident review and reporting.

FA2.KR20

Review processes, plans and resourcing for response to future potential data breaches.
The HSE should ensure the appropriate resources, tools and templates are created with sufficient
advance notice and time prior to notifying data subjects of a breach. Having initial notification letters,
FAQ’s, responses, and sufficiently trained resources to manage an influx of requests for information
will be critical to ensuring a successful roll out of notification if and when required. The HSE should
also review and document the processes established during the response to support their future
preparedness. They should:

FA2.KR21

•

Complete the work of the Legal and Data Workstream in response to the Incident;

•

 mbed the Legal and Data Workstream in the Crisis Management Framework
E
(see also recommendation FA2.KR5.1 and FA2.KR12);

•

 pdate the existing Data Protection Breach Management Policy to support the Legal and Data
U
Workstream in future responses, including the data breach notification risk assessment;

•

 ehearse the workstream’s response both individually and as part of wider HSE exercising
R
programme (see also recommendation FA2.KR8.3);

•

Agree retainers with third parties for future web monitoring services;

•

 nsure materials used to support the notification of data subjects, such as letters,
E
FAQs and talking points, are agreed with the Communications Team; and

•

 onduct resource planning for future notification programmes; for example, call centres
C
to respond to the significant influx of incoming requests once data subjects are notified.

Scenario planning should be informed by the risk register, the process embedded in the Crisis
Management Plan, and the activity conducted throughout incident and crisis response.
The HSE should ensure that the risk register is used to drive the creation of severe but plausible
scenarios against which the HSE should validate its resilience capability is validated. The process
should be extended to engage individuals from the HSE’s senior leadership team, risk management,
clinical and services continuity and crisis management disciplines in regular scenario planning against
the organisation’s top risks. This is best conducted in a workshop format to identify potential political,
economic, sociological, technical, legal and regulatory, environmental and organisational impacts
related to each of the HSE’s top risks, and to then explore the worst, best and most likely scenarios
for each.
Mitigating actions resulting from these workshops should be assigned to an owner with the
appropriate level of authority to facilitate organisational change where required, and tracked
throughout their lifecycle to confirm they are completed to an acceptable level. These actions and all
other outputs from these activities should be used to inform preparation activities across resilience
disciplines, to ensure that plans, processes and structures are fit for purpose; and where applicable
specific response plans to be developed for the most plausible risks (see also findings FA2.KR5.2).
Scenario planning should be included in the Crisis Management Plan to support HSE to prepare for
likely outcomes and mitigate subsequent impacts during a response.

FA2.KR22.1

Design clinical and services continuity workarounds, informed by the Clinical and Services
Impact Analysis.
The HSE should design and agree clinical and services continuity workarounds, for critical processes,
with the agility and governance to be maintained for a prolonged period, and based on the Clinical and
Services Impact Analysis (see also recommendations FA2.KR3.1, FA2.KR4 and FA2.KR23).

individual with responsibility for overseeing the consolidation of patient and service data; and

•

 econcile all medical data stored and managed through interim processes post the attack,
R
including data stored on personal devices/accounts and in paper form.

Rehearse workarounds in multi-team exercises.
The HSE, HGs and CHOs should participate in multi-team exercises to explore how high impact or
likely scenarios could impact their operations. This is extremely important as it helps identify likely and
potential impacts to the organisation and responders. These may often need a team and significant
investment to resolve, however even the discussion and establishment of hypothetical workarounds
will likely reduce the number of ineffective emergency protocols and allow space for creative thinking
to consider the ideal solution for all parties involved (see also recommendation FA2.KR8.3).

FA2.KR22.4

Consider a review to establish the longer term clinical impacts of the Conti attack.
Finally, the HSE should consider conducting a review to understand the longer term clinical impacts
that resulted from the Conti attack. This review should build on the findings of the draft research report
into the effectiveness of the patient safety risk mitigation strategies following the Incident, and inform
future steps to improve the HSE resilience against potential future attacks and minimise the risk to
patient care.

FA2.KR23

Ensure the Clinical and Services Impact Analysis is informed by an up-to-date asset register and
configuration management database (see also findings FA2.KF3 and FA2.KF22.1).
As part of this process, the HSE should work with CHOs and HGs to develop a clear overview of the
interdependencies between all departments and local sites using HSE infrastructure or services, with
the aim to create a prioritised list for systems at both a central and local level. This should be informed
by a service model for delivering patient care. The HSE should reconcile all medical data stored and
managed through interim processes post the attack, including data stored on personal devices/
accounts and in paper form (see also finding FA2.KF20).
Contingency plans should be developed by the business owners and IT teams to maintain priority and
critical services (as defined in a Clinical and Services Impact Analysis) during the disruption of one
or more key systems. These plans should be socialised and embedded across the organisation, and
a version of them stored offline, to ensure they can be implemented effectively during an incident. In
the event of an incident impacting multiple systems, as within the Conti attack, recovery prioritisation
should be addressed on a regular basis from the beginning of the response, to direct resources to the
appropriate systems and services from the offset.

Recommendation description

FA2.KR24

Map and document the people and technology resources and processes required to recover all
critical systems in a pre-defined sequence.
The HSE should ensure that the Cyber Incident Response Playbook documents a pathway to recovery
that maps the people, processes and technology requirements of each system, to provide a pathway
to recovery in the event of single or multiple system failure. During a major outage or disruption,
recovery priorities should be agreed with central and local response and IT teams and communicated
to all responders to streamline the recovery of integrated and independent systems. Once recovery
priorities have been agreed, incident response mechanisms need to be invoked that provide the most
effective communication and coordination between teams.
Central coordination meetings should be held with the asset and application register acting as a tool to
guide recovery activities. A read-only, and regularly updated, list of prioritised applications should be
made available to all technical recovery teams to direct their activities and keep them informed of the
actions being undertaken across the response.
To achieve this an operational rhythm needs to be established by:
•

 etting up a meeting cadence at and between each response level e.g., operational or “Bronze”
S
(HG and CHO) meeting followed by a tactical or “Silver” (HSE) meeting, then a strategic or “Gold”
(EMT) meeting to share a cascade of updates increasing in importance, escalating priorities. This
waterfall flow between the command levels should also be used in reverse to share decisions and
actions simultaneously to all teams and impacted sites;

•

 ach meeting following a set agenda to ensure all required areas are covered off, particularly in
E
terms of situational awareness of the Incident; and

•

Use of uniform templates for collecting incident updates, action tracking and required decisions.

It is recommended that at each level of response there is a dedicated role to ensure coordination
within and between teams. This can be the role of a Crisis Coordinator or SITCEN Information
Manager (see also finding FA2.KF15).
FA3. KR1

The HSE should continue to develop an asset register that is aligned to clinical and corporate services,
as well as underpinning a process to ensure the register is maintained up to date. Doing so will allow
the HSE to determine the potential impact of any future incident and effectively respond in a planned,
controlled and structured manner.

FA3. KR2

The HSE should create a cybersecurity strategy, covering at a minimum incident detection, incident
response and business recovery. It will also need to be aligned to the HSE strategy objectives and
signed off by the HSE Board.

FA3. KR3

The HSE should establish an appropriate cybersecurity risk and governance framework to ensure
there is a consistent and clear allocation of responsibility, authority, and accountability. Including the
need to establish reporting processes to ensure potential cybersecurity incidents are appropriately
reported in all cases. This should provide a forum for key stakeholders e.g. Clinical Operations,
Corporate Services, Third Party service managers, Sections 38s and 39s to discuss and align on
cybersecurity priorities. The HSE should appoint a senior leader for cybersecurity (a CISO) who
has experience rapidly reducing organisations vulnerability to threat, designing cyber security
transformation programmes and providing assurance to Boards of management. This should provide
the required assurance to the Board in facilitating effective cybersecurity management.

FA3. KR4

The HSE should complete its required OES returns on an annual basis to ensure compliance with
NISD regulations and to understand potential cybersecurity weaknesses with critical services.

FA3. KR5

The HSE should develop a formal cybersecurity risk framework aligned to the business’ operational
risks and strategic plans.

FA3. KR6

The HSE should implement a Third Party Risk Management framework that defines how third parties
to the HSE are assessed for cybersecurity risks and what risk treatment plans are appropriate to
address residual cyber risk.

FA3. KR7

The HSE should introduce a comprehensive, formalised cybersecurity training and awareness
programme that is delivered to all staff at all grades across the organisation. This should be conducted
on a regular basis.

FA3. KR8

The HSE should introduce centralised processes and procedures to manage and review the
appropriate access and identities that require access to services and data. This should be in the form
of an Identity Access Management (IAM) solution that would consistently manage access across
users, System Admins and third parties.

Recommendation description

FA3. KR9

ICT HSE should implement a structured process for performing data backups and storing this data off
site. Regular testing of this data should take place to ensure success recovery.

FA3. KR10

The HSE should develop a strategy for adopting the appropriate protective technologies and ensure
consistent deployment across the HSE network.

FA3. KR11

The HSE should develop a process to maintain security baselines for all operational hardware
and software, including but not limited to establishing preventative processes such as patch and
vulnerability management processes.

FA3. KR12

The HSE should develop a cybersecurity threat profile that is informed by relevant sources to enable
an effective monitoring capability. This should include threat intelligence feeds to provide an informed
view of the latest cyber threats relevant to the HSE. These feeds should be used in conjunction with a
SIEM to inform and provide IOCs for monitoring and detecting across the HSE ICT estate. Aligned to
this the HSE should implement anti-virus consistently across the estate, ensure it as well as logging
and EDR outputs are aggregated and obtain a 24x7 security operations centre (SOC) to monitor the
entire business and detect anomalous behaviour and events.

FA3. KR13

The HSE should implement alert monitoring on all network servers, endpoint devices, and firewalls
for the external and internal networks. Specific use cases for each alert should be developed for the
chosen SIEM.

FA3. KR14

The HSE should implement a holistic network detection and response functionality with a dedicated
team to continually monitor for and respond to alerts.

FA3. KR15

The HSE should develop an appropriate cybersecurity response policy, supported by plans and/or run
books for cybersecurity incidents that are regularly reviewed and exercised so that it can mount an
effective and efficient response in the event of a future incident.

FA3. KR16

The HSE should develop a formal internal communications plan where key internal parties such
as senior leadership, voluntary hospitals, CHOs are receiving timely and consistent messages.
Specifically the HSE should develop specific runbooks and template responses for specific scenarios
to aid a speedy response and ensure there is consistent communication

FA3. KR17

The HSE should ensure that an appropriate response policy, plan, and process are in place to manage
multiple security incidents, perform response investigations, and collect evidence to assess the best
potential mitigation plan.

FA3. KR18

The HSE should develop formal mitigation strategies and tactics to isolate, remove, and monitor
threats. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be put in place so that performance can be
optimised.

FA3. KR19

The HSE should establish a formal process, as well as resources to ensure lessons were learnt and
codified from all incidents and are maintained to reflect operational and organisational change.

FA3. KR20

The HSE should implement a cybersecurity recovery plan that links to an asset register detailing
Clinical, Corporate and other priorities and test this plan on a regular basis.

FA3. KR21

The HSE should develop a formal process for capturing improvements/lessons learnt following
an incident.

FA3. KR22

The HSE should consider developing a communications strategy for cybersecurity incidents.
