An Iranian hacking group has continued its phishing operations undeterred by indictments
from the US Department of Justice.
The group's name is Cobalt Dickens or Silent Librarian. In March 2018, the US DOJ
charged nine hackers it believed were behind the group's activity.
DOJ officials said the suspects were "hackers-for-hire or affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an
Iran-based company that, since at least 2013, conducted a coordinated campaign of cyber
intrusions," at the behest of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), one of the
country's intelligence agencies.
The nine were charged with carrying out cyber-attacks against 144 US universities and 176
universities in 21 foreign countries, but also attacks against 47 US and foreign companies
active in various private sectors.
According to court documents, the group primarily targeted universities. A PhishLabs report
described the group's modus operandi. Their favorite tactic, albeit not the only one, was to
use phishing pages for a university's online library portal.

Hackers used the collected logins to steal intellectual property from the university's library,
which they later resold online on various portals, such as Megapaper.ir (Megapaper) and
Gigapaper.ir (Gigapaper), two websites operated by a company controlled by one of the
nine suspects.

New Cobalt Dickens campaign discovered
But according to a report shared with Bleeping Computer in advance, US cyber-security
firm Secureworks says it detected new phishing attacks carried out by the same Cobalt
Dickens group.
Secureworks researchers say they initially discovered one URL spoofing a login page for a
university but after further investigations, they uncovered a broader campaign aimed at
multiple targets.
"Sixteen domains contained over 300 spoofed websites and login pages for 76 universities
located in 14 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, Switzerland,
Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States," revealed Secureworks experts.
They also say the domains were registered between May and August 2018, a clear
indicator that the indictment hasn't phased the group's members or forced them
underground, as most hackers tend to do after being publicly ousted.
After getting run off of @Namecheap, #SilentLibrarian actors are now using straightup Iranian-hosted websites for their phishing sites. The group recently switched over
to the domain UNTC[.]IR. Today's targets: @LancasterUni @ucl @Stockholm_Uni
Really covert guys!

Why shouldn't these hackers keep up their phishing activity? It's not like they are
going to get extradited to the U.S. to face criminal charges.
