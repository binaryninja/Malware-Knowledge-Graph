EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NORTH KOREA’S PATH TO BECOMING A GLOBAL CYBER SUPERPOWER

Military-Focused Targeting
Early 2000s – 2014 characterized
primarily by military-focused
targeting.

Currency Generation Operations

Dual-Focused Operations

Late 2015 – early 2018 geared more so
towards currency generation attacks
(fraud, ransomware, SWIFT banking
system attacks, etc.)

Early 2018 onwards marks a shift
towards dual-focused ops
engaging both economic
expansion targets & gov targets

PHASE 1: MILITARY FOCUSED TARGETING

The Personas
In the beginning, North Korea
sought to avoid attribution by
leveraging aliases in the course of
their attacks

Military Targeting of the USA/ROK

Power Projection

Multiple DDoS and data theft operations
performed against US and ROK military
targets in order to promote national
security objectives

Projecting capabilities
internationally to demonstrate
force to include commercial
targets with a symbolic nexus
to adversarial entities

system, which is the international
banking messaging system, to
engage in global fraud

Leveraging malware capabilities such
as FastCash to engage banking
entities throughout Asia and Africa

Leveraging ransomware in
order to target corporate
entities and fulfill financial
objectives

Swift Targeting
§ 19 Total attacks observed in 18 countries
§ Attempts to steal over 2 Billion USD across all
financial targeting
§ Deep knowledge of target systems well before
the hack was performed
§ Specialized one off malware
§ Modify output of FoxIT PDF reader to hide
transactions
§ Wipers deployed behind the attack
§ Highly modular malware framework with
wipers to delete evidence

ATM Jackpotting (Operation FASTCash)
§Begins with TwoPence Framework to
establish a beachhead
§Specialized AIX Operating system specific
malware

in May 2017 other variants date back to
February 2017
§ Earlier victims had destructive malware on
their network

§Infection vector with ties to the KorDLL
framework
§Utilized EternalBlue so anyone with open
SMB ports was a target
§200,000 Systems infected worldwide
demanding $300+ in bitcoin but only

but did not disrupt energy production
§ 2018 ceased targeting of US but continued
EU and APAC

§2019 Indian Powerplant targeting
§ Targeting made to look destructive but
really espionage focused
§ Dtrack Malware tied back to Indian ATMs
and even RoK banks because you need to
keep the lights on

Expanded Criminal Operations (Crypto)
§Crypto Currency targeting via fake

to gain legitimacy

§eCrime collaboration with multiple
different actors
§Lazarus collaboration and delivery via
Trickbot

§MataNet malware which works on

CONCLUSION

WHAT THE FUTURE MAY HOLD FOR THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME

Advanced Ransomware
Operations

Taking a Page out of China’s
Playbook

DPRK may engage in more
advanced ransomware ops
techniques to include data extortion,
ransomware-as-a-service, etc.

Similar to China, DPRK will likely refine
their focus on economic growth targets
in support of their five-year plan
objectives

Cyber Brinkmanship
In order to avoid kinetic
retaliation, DPRK may
transition focus away from
nuclear deterrence more
towards cyber deterrence
