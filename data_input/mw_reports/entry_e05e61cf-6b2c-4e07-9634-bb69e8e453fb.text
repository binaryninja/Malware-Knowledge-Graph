Hafnium Update: Continued Microsoft Exchange Server
Exploitation
blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/03/hafnium-update.html

Update 3/11: The following OSQuery detects active commands being run through webshells
observed used by actors on compromised Exchange servers. While systems may have been
patched to defend against Hafnium and others, threat actors may have leveraged these
vulnerabilities to establish additional persistence in victim networks. A thorough forensic
investigation will be required to determine additional compromises.

It's been a week since Microsoft first disclosed several zero-day vulnerabilities in Exchange
Server — and the scope has only grown since then. In its disclosure, Microsoft stated that a
new threat actor known as Hafnium was exploiting these vulnerabilities to steal emails.
Since Microsoft's initial disclosure, Cisco Talos has seen shifts in the tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) associated with this activity. The majority of the activity continues to
follow the guidance that was previously provided. We are, however, starting to see other
groups' activity in active incidents Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) is responding to.
These actors appear to be separate from the initial "HAFNIUM" actor and include groups that
are leveraging infrastructure previously attributed to cryptocurrency mining campaigns,
groups creating or accessing web shells using notepad.exe or notepad++.exe and large
amounts of scanning activity without successful exploitation.
We have also identified organizations that may be involved in post-exploitation activity. The
victimology shows that financial services have been disproportionately affected by
exploitation, with a few other notable verticals following including health care, education and
local/state governments. This shows that, although the initial activity may have followed
closely with the guidance provided by Microsoft, as time passes, the amount of groups
exploiting these vulnerabilities is only going to increase. This compounds the importance of
patching these vulnerabilities as soon as possible.
Talos also has some new additions to the IOCs to look out for and other forms of coverage in
Cisco Secure products.

As the days have passed the amount of victims and scope of the compromise has grown
significantly. As more actors move into the space, it's likely going to get worse. We
encourage everyone to patch as soon as possible. However, it may be too late for any users
who had a Microsoft Exchange server exposed. In those cases, it's important to hunt for
potential exploitation and any consequences. First, we'll walk through Cisco Secure Orbital
queries and how they can help users who fear they could be targets.

Hunting Hafnium using OSQuery and Orbital
Cisco Secure Endpoint customers have access to Orbital queries. These leverage osquery
to allow customers to query their endpoints directly. There are several ways a customer can
leverage this to identify potential Hafnium incidents.
Let's start by looking for the backdoors that may be present on servers. We'll begin by
executing a query looking for them. These payloads can include things like web shells and
potentially other utilities like powercat. After the user has logged into the Orbital portal, they
can select the endpoints they want to run the queries against, which in this case, may be the
applicable Exchange servers. Then, you provide a custom SQL looking for the web shells,
which has been provided below.
SELECT script_path, script_text, DATETIME(time, "unixepoch", "UTC") AS
creation_time FROM orbital_powershell_events WHERE regex_match(script_text,
"New-Object\s+System\.Net\.Sockets\.TCPClient.+.GetStream\s*\(\s*\).*\[\s*byte\s*\
[\s*\]\s*\].*0\.\.65535\|:ASCII\)\.GetBytes.+.Write\s*\(.+.Flush\s*\(\s*\)\s*\}.+.Close\s*\
(\s*\)",0);
One thing of note here is that the orbital_powershell_events table is being used. Those
familiar with osquery may have been expecting powershell_events, but the Orbital team has
built their own version and that is what the query is based on. If you are attempting more
general osquery requests outside of orbital, please use powershell_events instead. This
particular regex will match on the web shells that have been attributed to these campaigns.
Any results should be triaged and responded to accordingly.

3/10

The example above is an example of how to search for the webshells. Now, let's focus on
some of the other payloads like powercat. Here is a second query that is specifically looking
for powercat, one of the other non-webshell based payloads, which is provided below:
SELECT script_path, script_text, DATETIME(time, "unixepoch", "UTC") AS
creation_time FROM orbital_powershell_events WHERE script_path LIKE
"%raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat%" OR script_path LIKE
"%powercat.ps1%"
Again, this query makes use of orbital_powershell_events and should be modified if applying
it to non-orbital-based systems. This query, once executed, should also provide customers
with the systems where this activity is likely to be found.

4/10

Let's move past the initial compromise and start looking for some of the post-exploitation
activity. One of the most common post-exploitation activities was for the adversaries to
export mailboxes. This can also be found using the same Orbital interface with another
query, provided below.
SELECT script_path, script_text, DATETIME(time, "unixepoch", "UTC") AS
creation_time FROM orbital_powershell_events WHERE regex_match(script_text,
"Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Exchange.Management.Powershell.SnapIn;(GetMailboxExportRequest|Get-Mailbox&#x0A)", 0);
This query will identify the mailbox export requests that are part of the TTPs associated with
these campaigns. Again, if executed properly, it should show the customer what systems
have potentially been affected and whether or not a mailbox export has already occurred.
These types of queries can be invaluable to a security organization trying to identify, not only
if they were a victim, but how severe the effects may be. These queries are an excellent
resource for security organizations, but it isn't the only way you can identify the activity in
your environment.

Hunting Hafnium using Cisco Secure IPS
Part of our coverage includes NGIPS signatures that can identify the scanning and
exploitation activity, as well as the post exploitation activity of web shells. As such, it can be
leveraged to see if and how your enterprise may have been affected. Start by logging into
your console and then browsing to intrusion events and editing a search (shown below).

Now you can focus the search for just the applicable signatures associated with Hafnium
(57233-57246, 57251-57253). This will allow only the events associated with Hafnium and
applicable webshells to be shown, this can be achieved by searching by Snort ID (shown
below). Please note that some of these signatures do require TLS decryption to be in place
with Exchange servers similar to how it was required for Blue Keep detection.

6/10

After adjusting the search to cover the applicable time frame, there will be a list of the
signatures that fired in the environment during that period. If you click through, you can get
details about the systems that are affected and review any packet capture data obtained.

Shown below are the details provided for the events that triggered the signature, including
source and destination information and country of origin.

At this point, defenders can use the IOCs derived from these events to potentially focus any
additional investigations or as potential support of investigations already underway.
One of the most important takeaways for defenders is around the web shell signatures. Just
because you found a web shell does not mean you were a Hafnium target Web shells are a
common payload and may be the result of other actors leveraging other vulnerabilities.
Regardless of their origins, they should be thoroughly investigated and remediated.
These are just a few examples of ways that Cisco Secure products can be leveraged to
identify if your enterprise was potentially affected and what payloads may have been
dropped by the adversary. Customers could also search for other relevant IOCs such as
domains and IPs in other Cisco Secure solutions like Umbrella and Cisco Secure Network
Analytics.
If you find yourself a victim to this campaign or others that have dropped webshells and think
you may need incident response help. CTIR has already been dealing with multiple incidents
and stands ready to help remediate any issues that may have been uncovered.

Conclusion
As the days have passed, the effect of Hafnium has only grown. Patching is the first order of
business for any organization, but shortly thereafter, or concurrently, investigation into if and
7/10

how you were compromised is going to be paramount. Talos' intelligence provides many
avenues for defenders to not only prevent compromise from occurring as the amount of
actors leveraging these vulnerabilities increases, but also hunt for any activity that may have
already occurred. As we learn more about the nature of these attacks and the end goals, we
will continue to provide updates on what we are seeing in the field from the perspective of
our threat intelligence researchers and incident responders.
