Analyst, Mandiant Threat Intel

About this talk
FIN11 is a financially motivated threat group that delivers malware through widespread and
highly successful phishing campaigns that have impacted organizations across sectors and
geographies. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has observed FIN11 attempting to monetize their
operations at least once using named point-of-sale (POS) malware and, more frequently,
using ransomware combined with traditional extortion techniques. In addition to their highvolume spam campaigns, FIN11 is also notable due their consistent evolvement of malware
delivery tactics and techniques. Join Genevieve Stark and Andy Moore from Mandiant Threat
Intelligence for a look into the motivations, tactics and operations of this newly “graduated”
threat group, including the group’s previous activity, common TTPs, and anticipated future
focus.
