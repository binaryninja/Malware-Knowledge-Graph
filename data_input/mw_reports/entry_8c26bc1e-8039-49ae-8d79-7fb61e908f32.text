Treasury Sanctions Russian Government Research Institution Connected to the Triton Malware | U.S. Department of the Treasury

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
Treasury Sanctions Russian Government Research Institution
Connected to the Triton Malware
October 23, 2020

Washington – Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
designated, pursuant to Section 224 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act (CAATSA), a Russian government research institution that is connected to the
destructive Triton malware. The Triton malware — known also as TRISIS and HatMan in open
source reporting — was designed specifically to target and manipulate industrial safety
systems. Such systems provide for the safe emergency shutdown of industrial processes at
critical infrastructure facilities in order to protect human life. The cyber actors behind the Triton
malware have been referred to by the private cybersecurity industry as “the most dangerous
threat activity publicly known.”
“The Russian Government continues to engage in dangerous cyber activities aimed at the
United States and our allies,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “This Administration will
continue to aggressively defend the critical infrastructure of the United States from anyone
attempting to disrupt it.”
In recent years, the Triton malware has been deployed against U.S. partners in the Middle East,
and the hackers behind the malware have been reportedly scanning and probing U.S. facilities.
The development and deployment of the Triton malware against our partners is particularly
troubling given the Russian government’s involvement in malicious and dangerous cyberenabled activities. Previous examples of Russia’s reckless activities in cyberspace include, but
are not limited to: the NotPetya cyber-attack, the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in
history; cyber intrusions against the U.S. energy grid to potentially enable future offensive
operations; the targeting of international organizations such as the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Anti-Doping Agency; and the 2019 disruptive
cyber-attack against the country of Georgia.

In August 2017, a petrochemical facility in the Middle East was the target of a cyber-attack
involving the Triton malware. This cyber-attack was supported by the State Research Center of
the Russian Federation FGUP Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and
Mechanics (TsNIIKhM), a Russian government-controlled research institution that is
responsible for building customized tools that enabled the attack.
The Triton malware was designed to target a specific industrial control system (ICS) controller
used in some critical infrastructure facilities to initiate immediate shutdown procedures in the
event of an emergency. The malware was initially deployed through phishing that targeted the
petrochemical facility. Once the malware gained a foothold, its operators attempted to
manipulate the facility’s ICS controllers. During the attack, the facility automatically shut down
after several of the ICS controllers entered into a failed safe state, preventing the malware’s full
functionality from being deployed, and prompting an investigation that ultimately led to the
discovery of the malware. Researchers who investigated the cyber-attack and the malware
reported that Triton was designed to give the attackers complete control of infected systems
and had the capability to cause significant physical damage and loss of life. In 2019, the
attackers behind the Triton malware were also reported to be scanning and probing at least 20
electric utilities in the United States for vulnerabilities.
TsNIIKhM is being designated pursuant to Section 224 of CAATSA for knowingly engaging in
significant activities undermining cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic
institution, or government on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
As a result of today’s designation, all property and interests in property of TsNIIKhM that are in
or come within the possession of U.S. persons are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally
prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or
more owned by one or more designated persons are also blocked. Moreover, non-U.S. persons
who engage in certain transactions with TsNIIKhM may themselves be exposed to sanctions.
