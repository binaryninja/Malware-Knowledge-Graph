Ransomware are today very effective and they cause serious problems in many companies,
we hear almost everyday entire businesses under ransom and companies who loose
turnover and opportunities since have no available data to deal with. For such a reson I feel
like I have to contribute in somehow to the community by giving what I can on this topic. So,
this is my little contribution to fight CONTI ransomware: an API block cheat sheet. In other
words by reading such a flow you should have the main CONTI functionalities mapped by
API call blocks. It might help you in the following ways:
To learn how the current CONTI ransomware works (if you had no chance to reverse it)
To extract behavioural models for your Manchine Learning engine
To synthetize API call signatures for your dynamic detection engine
Extract behavioural patterns for your SIEM

CONTI Ransomware Cheat Sheet
The Execution flow is represented by the long up-to-down raws and it runs from left to right.
The main API calls are included into rectangles while the conditional jumps are mapped into
diamonds. Next to specific rectangles (API Calls) a little note is giving further details on the
analyzed step. Square brackets wraps API calls into blocks so that you might easily read the
six logic CONTI steps, that are: Preparation, System Information, Find and Delete Shadow
Copies, Looking for External Targets (shared folders), Encryption Preparation (ransom note
included) and Encryption Execution.
