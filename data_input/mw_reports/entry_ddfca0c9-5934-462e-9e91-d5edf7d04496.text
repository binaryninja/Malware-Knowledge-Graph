Despite Leaks, Conti Ransomware Attacks Persist
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/conti-ransomware-attacks-persist-updated-version-despite-leaks

In late January 2022, ThreatLabz identified an updated version of Conti ransomware as part
of the global ransomware tracking efforts. This update was released prior to the massive
leak of Conti source code and chat logs on Februrary 27, 2022. The leaks were published
by a Ukrainian researcher after the invasion of Ukraine. However, since these leaks were
published, the Conti gang has continued to attack organizations and conduct business as
usual. While two versions of Conti source code have been leaked, the most recent
ransomware code has not yet been leaked. This blog will highlight the most recent changes
to the ransomware and how Conti improved file encryption, introduced techniques to better
evade security software, and streamlined the ransom payment process.

Technical Analysis
The most recent Conti update introduced a number of new features and changes to the
ransomware code. Some of these modifications include new command-line arguments that
are highlighted in bold in Table 1.

Command-Line
Argument

Description

-log

Previously used to log ransomware actions; this functionality has
been removed, but the command-line switch remains an artifact from
the previous version

1/9

-path

Start encryption using the specified path as the root directory

-size

Size parameter for large file encryption

-mode

Encryption mode local (disks) or net (network shares); the all and
backups options were removed

-user

Log in to Windows Safe Mode as the specified user

-pass

Log in to Windows Safe Mode as the user with the
corresponding password

-safeboot

Force reboot the system and launch Conti in Windows Safe
Mode

disablesafeboot

Disable Windows Safe Mode and reboot the system (used after
file encryption occurs in Windows Safe Mode)

-nomutex

Previously used to prevent the creation of a mutex; currently unused

Table 1. Conti command-line arguments updated in January 2022
The functionality for the command-line arguments -log and -nomutex was removed. The
new command-line parameters that were added are related to features that enable Conti to
reboot the system in Windows Safe Mode with networking enabled and then start file
encryption. By booting in Safe Mode, Conti can maximize the number of files that are
encrypted, because business applications such as databases are likely not running.
Therefore, those applications will not have open file handles that could prevent file
encryption. In addition, many security software applications (e.g., antivirus programs) will
not be loaded by default when the system is running in Safe Mode. The ability to encrypt
files in Windows Safe Mode is a feature that has been observed in other ransomware
families including REvil and BlackMatter.
If the -safeboot command-line argument is provided together with the -user and -pass
parameters, Conti will use these values to automatically log in with the specified credentials
when the system is rebooted into Safe Mode. This is performed by setting the registry
values under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon to the following:

2/9

AutoAdminLogon = 1
DefaultUserName = <username>
DefaultDomainName = <computer_name or domain_name>
DefaultPassword = <password>

The -user argument is expected to be in the format: <domain_name>\<username>.
If the -safeboot command-line argument is passed by itself (without the -user and -pass
parameters), Conti will search for users that have administrator privileges by searching for
the security identifier (SID) prefix S-1-5-21 with the relative identifier (RID) -500.
If Conti is able to locate an administrator account, Conti will execute the commandcmd.exe
/c net user <admin> /active:yes to make sure the account is enabled. Conti will then
attempt to change the password for this account to an empty string by executing the
command cmd.exe /c net user <admin> "". The corresponding registry values will then be
set to automatically log in as the administrator in Safe Mode when the system is rebooted.
Figure 1 shows example registry values set after an administrator account has been set up
to automatically log in.

In order to execute Conti when the system is booted into Safe Mode, a registry value is
created under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce with
the name *conti and the value <path_to_conti_executable> -disablesafeboot.
Conti then executes the command bcedit.exe /set {current} safeboot network and forces
a system reboot by calling the Windows API function ExitWindowsEx(). This will launch
Windows in Safe Mode with networking enabled as shown in Figure 2. The network mode is
enabled, so that Conti can still be used to encrypt files on network shares.

After Conti has completed file encryption in Safe Mode, it executes the command
bcedit.exe /deletevalue {current} safeboot and reboots the system. Conti's file encryption
algorithms remain the same as previous versions with a per file random 256-bit ChaCha
symmetric key. Each file's ChaCha key is protected by a hardcoded victim-specific 4,096-bit
RSA public key.
The new Conti update also added the ability to change desktop wallpaper by writing an
embedded PNG file to C:\ProgramData\conti.png. An example of the Conti wallpaper image
is shown in Figure 3.

The feature to change the wallpaper after file encryption is very common among
ransomware families to further attract the attention of victims.
In order to hinder malware analysis, Conti dynamically resolves most Windows API
functions by using a hash algorithm. In the previous version of Conti, the hash algorithm
was Murmur2, while the latest version now uses Murmur3. This produces different hash
values for all API functions that are used by Conti, which may evade security software that
searches for the corresponding hash values.
Conti also updated the encrypted file extensions to include uppercase and lowercase
characters and numbers. The following file extension examples have been observed in
recent Conti samples:
.ZG7Ak
.wjzPe
.LvOYK
.C5eFx
.fgM9X
This encrypted file extension modification may be designed to bypass endpoint security
software that could identify the previous Conti ransomware pattern that used five uppercase
letters.
Conti also updated the ransom note and TOR hidden service URL. An example of a recent
Conti ransom note is shown below:

result in serious harm to your company!
Inform your supervisors and stay calm!

The new Conti ransom note is streamlined with a direct link to a victim-specific chat portal.
Prior versions required a victim to access the portal and then upload their ransom note,
which contained a unique identifier.
The latest Conti portal contains a landing page that instructs the user to follow the
instructions in the README.txt file that is written to disk after file encryption. It no longer
supports a victim uploading the ransom note to authenticate as shown in Figure 4.

Conclusion
In January 2022, Conti introduced new features to bring feature parity with other
ransomware families including the ability to encrypt files in Windows Safe Mode and change
the desktop wallpaper. Despite the group's source code and chat logs being leaked online
in February 2022, Conti continues to conduct ransomware attacks against large
organizations. ThreatLabz expects the Conti gang to further update the malware and
potentially rebrand as the source code leaks have damaged their reputation and may lead
to other criminal groups forking the code.
