In 2018, EFF along with researchers from Lookout Security published a report describing the
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) we dubbed "Dark Caracal." Now we have uncovered a
new Dark Caracal campaign operating since March of 2022, with hundreds of infections
across more than a dozen countries. In this report we will present evidence that the cyber
1/15

mercenary group Dark Caracal is still active and continues to be focused on Latin America,
as was reported last year. We have discovered that Dark Caracal, using the Bandook
spyware, is currently infecting over 700 computers in Central and South America, primarily in
The Dominican Republic and Venezuela.
In our original 2018 report, we described a campaign targeting thousands of Lebanese
citizens with several different malware families, including a brand new mobile remote access
trojan we named Pallas and a Windows remote access trojan called Bandook. Through our
research we were able to shut down the malware campaign and notify a number of the
victims. Our Operation Manul report established that the actors behind the campaign were
working with the governments of Lebanon and Kazakhstan. The variety of targets and the
apparent involvement of multiple governments throughout the campaigns lead us to believe
that Dark Caracal is a cyber-mercenary or hack-for-hire group.
Since our original Dark Caracal report, there have been multiple reports on their continued
activities. Checkpoint Research wrote about a campaign in 2020 and we have continued to
follow the activities of Dark Caracal with our most recent report, also in 2020. Most recently,
ESET wrote about Dark Caracal activities in Latin America in their report Bandidos at Large.
Dark Caracal is far from the only malware group currently targeting Latin America. The
Quantum malware group targeted the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Agriculture in 2022.
The Dominican Republic is also a reported customer of NSO group.
Given Dark Caracal’s history of working with national governments — such as Kazakhstan
and Lebanon — on politically motivated campaigns, it is possible that the new campaign
described below is also at the behest of a government actor, but without more insight into
who the infected computers belong to, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the motivation
of these attacks.
Regardless, we call on lawmakers and regulators in South and Central America to be vigilant
against Dark Caracal's spyware since it, and other spyware like it, has been used to commit
gross human rights violations. Time and again, nation-states and cyber-mercenaries have
used spyware to target activists, human rights defenders, and journalists whose actual work
is to uncover governments' wrongdoing, speak truth to power and hold governments
accountable. Such targeting has resulted in a growing list of extrajudicial killings of journalists
and human rights defenders.
Governments should consider calling for a moratorium on the governmental use of these
malware technologies, support computer security research, and human rights for all,
including transparency, accountability and redress for victims.
Governments must recognize that government hostility to device security is dangerous for
their people. If one government can use malware against civilians under a rival government
there is nothing stopping the rival government from doing the same. Governments should be
2/15

focusing on improving computer security and protecting their citizens rights to freedom of
expression.
We hope this report will add to a body of work exposing cyber mercenaries and convince
policymakers that cyber mercenaries and nation-state hacking are truly a global threat to
human rights and civil society.

A new campaign appears
Recently we discovered a new version of the Bandook malware, which has been updated to
have 148 unique commands it can send the infected computer, far more than the 120
available in previous samples. This sample and related samples seem to be part of a
campaign that began in March 2022, utilizing a new command and control server (a remote
computer which issues orders to the infected computers and receives data stolen from the
infected computers) at the domain deapproved[.]ru.
In the “Bandidos at Large” report, ESET researchers detailed a mechanism within Bandook
for downloading Windows DLLs (software libraries for Windows) from a domain secondary to
the main command and control server to gain additional functionality. On analyzing the
samples we obtained, we found that in this case the mechanism for downloading additional
DLLs pointed to the domain unclesow[.]com. However, upon investigating, we realized that
the unclesow.com domain had not yet been registered. We figured that this domain could
provide information on Dark Caracal’s activities, so we registered it and set up a sinkhole (a
server which hosts a domain that previously belonged to a malware campaign to protect
infected computers and collect information.)
Unclesow[.]com is currently hosted by EFF. Since registering this domain, we have been
collecting aggregate information on the victims of this malware campaign. Based on daily
traffic logs, there appear to be between 600 and 800 infected machines at any time, mostly
across Central and South America. Since every Bandook infection connects to the
secondary domain multiple times per day, we are confident that we are seeing all infections
for this current campaign. Because of our concern for the privacy of the victims of this
malware campaign we have configured the server to delete logs after four weeks and collect
the bare minimum of necessary information.
The same day that we set up DNS entries for unclesow[.]com, several other domains that
had been previously registered had their DNS suddenly pointed at the same server that
hosted unclesow. There were 6 domains pointed automatically at our server:
setsizee[.]com
seconsave[.]com
scanlostt[.]com
sanesity[.]biz
Email-securlink[.]com
goadaaddy[.]com
3/15

Based on the timing and apparent phishing-related nature of these domains, we suspect this
was an automatic process, possibly set up by the same people running the Dark Caracal
campaign. A few days later, several of the domains were pointed at a new IP address not
under our control. However, three of the domains (seconsave[.]com scanlostt[.]com and
sensity[.]biz) still point to our sinkhole server. We were able to identify several other related
domains which were hosted on other servers at the same time as these domains (when they
were not pointing to our sinkhole.)
The connection of these domains to the current Dark Caracal campaign is unclear. They may
be for a different campaign or another purpose The tactics and tools and procedures used
don’t match up, with the above domains being hosted on DigitalOcean registered with
NameCheap and not mentioned in the Bandook samples, whereas the domains mentioned
in the Bandook samples are hosted with the bulletproof hosting provider OvO [ovo.sc], and
registered with a company called 1984 [1984.is]. Additionally, we observed no interesting
traffic or traffic indicative of a Bandook infection to any of the domains pointed at our sinkhole
other than unclesow[.]com. The only connection to this campaign for these domains is the
fact that they were pointed at our sinkhole automatically when we set it up. For now it
remains a mystery.
Since we registered the unclesow[.]com domain, the attackers have changed the command
and control domain twice, first to cudenpower.co and then to bomes[.]ru. However, in both
cases and still to this day, they have not changed the secondary infection domain from
unclesow[.]com, thus our sinkhole continues to function even for new samples of malware. It
is unclear whether the malware operators realize that their secondary domain is controlled by
us at this time.

Bandook Continues Evolving
The versions of Bandook this campaign uses appear to be newer than the ones used in the
last campaigns reported on by ESET. The first stage of the malware has switched from using
GOST for encryption of the payload to using DES for encryption of its second stage payload.
The key for decryption is derived from a passphrase by hashing it with the RIPEMD-128
algorithm.
Additionally the malware contains 148 possible commands it can send the infected computer
from the command and control server instead of the previous 132 in the samples analyzed
by ESET. The commands include capabilities such as: turning on the webcam, adding or
removing files from the computer, taking control of the mouse, recording the screen, starting
a remote desktop session, and downloading other libraries for additional functionality (see
appendix for more.)
These changes indicate a deep nexus to the Dark Caracal group as the source code for
Bandook is not public and the malware is not for sale as far as we know.
4/15

At the time of this report, unpacked versions of malware were detected by 41 out of 70
antivirus products in VirusTotal whereas a representative sample of the packed malware was
detected by 35 out of 71 antivirus products.
The command and control servers are more locked-down than we have seen in the past,
with the only open services being SSH and the command and control service listening on
port 2222. There is no web administration interface as has been seen in the past.

Victimology
From connections to our sinkhole we have observed victims in several Central and South
American countries. Approximately 75% of infected computers are located in The Dominican
Republic and 20% in Venezuela.

A map of Bandook infections based on Shodan Data.
Because the infected computers connect to the sinkhole server and make an http GET
request for the path `/flras/get.php?huln=nevi` approximately every three hours we can
reliably estimate the number of infected machines. At its peak we suspect more than 800
computers were infected in this malware campaign. However, this number may be lower if
some machines are changing their IP addresses in the middle of the day due to moving to a
new network or a dynamic IP address changing. Since all connections initiated by Bandook
use a standard user agent (see Appendix) we do not have a way to keep track of individual
machines when they change IP addresses.
Because Bandook malware samples have only ever been observed for Windows, we
assume that the infected machines are all Windows computers. According to Shodan data,
many of the IP addresses belong to commodity routers on consumer ISP networks. It is our
5/15

assumption that those routers have dynamic IP addresses that frequently change, thus
increasing the number of unique IPs connecting to our sinkhole.
Infections drop off on Saturdays and especially Sundays, leading us to believe that most
infected machines are located at places of business. This hypothesis is also supported by
the number of connections from infected machines dropping on major public holidays such
as Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Year’s Day.

Number of infected computers connecting to our sinkhole per day
Though we haven’t been able to contact any of the victims of this current campaign, their
location opens the possibility that it is a continuation of the campaign outlined in the
Bandidos at Large Report. Because of Dark Caracal’s history of working on behalf of
governments, we can’t discount that possibility here either, though the client’s identity
remains a mystery for now.
Thanks to ESET, Martjin Grooten, Jeremy Kennely, Bill Marczak, and VirusTotal, for
assistance with this research.
