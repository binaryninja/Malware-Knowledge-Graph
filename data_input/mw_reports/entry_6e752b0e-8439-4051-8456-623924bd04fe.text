Introduction
Campaigns spreading Hancitor malware were active from October through December 2020, but Hancitor went
quiet after 2020-12-17. On Tuesday 2021-01-12, criminals started sending malicious spam (malspam) pushing
Hancitor again. Some people have already tweeted about this year's first wave of Hancitor. See the links below.
Today's diary reviews recent Hancitor activity from Tuesday 2021-01-12, where we also saw Cobalt Strike after the
initial infection.

Shown above: Flow chart for recent Hancitor infection activity.
The malspam
On Tuesday 2021-01-12, malspam spreading used the same fake DocuSign template we saw several times last
year. These emails have a link to a Google Docs page.

Infection traffic
As you might expect, traffic to the Google Docs page and clicking on the link generates a great deal of related web
activity, mostly HTTPS traffic. Shortly after the Word document is sent, we find indicators of Hancitor and Cobalt
Strike malware. I've always seen Cobalt Strike when I test Hancitor in an Active Directory (AD) environment. if
you're investigating an actual Hancitor infection, be aware that it will likely send Cobalt Strike if the victim host is
signed into an work environment that uses AD.

Shown above: Traffic caused by the Google Docs page before the infection filtered in Wireshark.

Final words

6/7

Hancitor has been active and evolving for years now, and it remains a notable presence in our current threat
landscape. This diary reviewed a recent infection on a vulnerable Windows host from malspam sent on Tuesday
2021-01-12.
Decent spam filters and best security practices should help most people avoid Hancitor infections. Default security
settings in Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 should prevent these these infections from happening.
However, it's a "cat-and-mouse" game, with malware developers developing new ways to circumvent security
measures, while vendors update their software/applications/endpoint protection to address these new
developments. And malware distribution through email is apparently cheap enough to remain profitable for the
criminals who use it.
A pcap of the infection traffic, some emails, and malware associated with today's diary can be found here.
