Preface
This blog post discusses the technical details of a state-sponsored attack manipulating DNS
systems. While this incident is limited to targeting primarily national security organizations
in the Middle East and North Africa, and we do not want to overstate the consequences of
this specific campaign, we are concerned that the success of this operation will lead to
actors more broadly attacking the global DNS system. DNS is a foundational technology
supporting the Internet. Manipulating that system has the potential to undermine the trust
users have on the internet. That trust and the stability of the DNS system as a whole drives
the global economy. Responsible nations should avoid targeting this system, work together
to establish an accepted global norm that this system and the organizations that control it
are off-limits, and cooperate in pursuing those actors who act irresponsibly by targeting this
system.

Executive Summary
1/13

Cisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling "Sea Turtle,"
which is targeting public and private entities, including national security organizations,
located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as
early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation
revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were
compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is
being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent
access to sensitive networks and systems.
The actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for
achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify
DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker
could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization's
domain names.
In the Sea Turtle campaign, Talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims. The first
group, we identify as primary victims, includes national security organizations, ministries of
foreign affairs, and prominent energy organizations. The threat actor targeted third-party
entities that provide services to these primary entities to obtain access. Targets that fall into
the secondary victim category include numerous DNS registrars, telecommunication
companies, and internet service providers. One of the most notable aspects of this
campaign was how they were able to perform DNS hijacking of their primary victims by first
targeting these third-party entities.
We assess with high confidence that these operations are distinctly different and
independent from the operations performed by DNSpionage, which we reported on in
November 2018. The Sea Turtle campaign almost certainly poses a more severe threat than
DNSpionage given the actor's methodology in targeting various DNS registrars and
registries. The level of access we presume necessary to engage in DNS hijacking successfully
indicates an ongoing, high degree of threat to organizations in the targeted regions. Due to
the effectiveness of this approach, we encourage all organizations, globally, to ensure they
have taken steps to minimize the possibility of malicious actors duplicating this attack
methodology.
The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign show clear signs of being highly capable
and brazen in their endeavors. The actors are responsible for the first publicly confirmed
case against an organizations that manages a root server zone, highlighting the attacker's
sophistication. Notably, the threat actors have continued their attacks despite public reports
documenting various aspects of their activity, suggesting they are unusually brazen and
may be difficult to deter going forward. In most cases, threat actors typically stop or slow
down their activities once their campaigns are publicly revealed.

This post provides the technical findings you would typically see in a Talos blog. We will also
offer some commentary on the threat actor's tradecraft, including possible explanations
about the actor's attack methodology and thought process. Finally, we will share the IOCs
that we have observed thus far, although we are confident there are more that we have not
seen.

Background on Domain Name Services and records management
The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign were successful in compromising entities
by manipulating and falsifying DNS records at various levels in the domain name space. This
section provides a brief overview of where DNS records are managed and how they are
accessed to help readers better understand how these events unfolded.
The first and most direct way to access an organization's DNS records is through the
registrar with the registrant's credentials. These credentials are used to login to the DNS
provider from the client-side, which is a registrar. If an attacker was able to compromise an
organization's network administrator credentials, the attacker would be able to change that
particular organization's DNS records at will.
The second way to access DNS records is through a DNS registrar, sometimes called
registrar operators. A registrar sells domain names to the public and manages DNS records
on behalf of the registrant through the domain registry. Records in the domain registry are
accessed through the registry application using the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP).
EPP was detailed in the request for comment (RFC) 5730 as "a means of interaction between
a registrar's applications and registry applications." If the attackers were able to obtain one
of these EPP keys, they would be able to modify any DNS records that were managed by that
particular registrar.
The third approach to gain access to DNS records is through one of the registries. These
registries manage any known TLD, such as entire country code top-level domains (ccTLDs)
and generic top-level domains (gTLDs). For example, Verisign manages all entities associated
with the top-level domain (TLD) ".com." All the different registry information then converges
into one of 12 different organization that manage different parts of the domain registry root.
The domain registry root is stored on 13 "named authorities in the delegation data for the
root zone," according to ICANN.
Finally, actors could target root zone servers to modify the records directly. It is important to
note that there is no evidence during this campaign (or any other we are aware of) that the
root zone servers were attacked or compromised. We highlight this as a potential avenue
that attackers would consider. The root DNS servers issued a joint statement that stated,
"There are no signs of lost integrity or compromise of the content of the root [server] zone…
There are no signs of clients having received unexpected responses from root servers."

Assessed Sea Turtle DNS hijacking methodology
It is important to remember that the DNS hijacking is merely a means for the attackers to
achieve their primary objective. Based on observed behaviors, we believe the actor
ultimately intended to steal credentials to gain access to networks and systems of interest.
To achieve their goals, the actors behind Sea Turtle:
1. Established a means to control the DNS records of the target.
2. Modified DNS records to point legitimate users of the target to actor-controlled
servers.
3. Captured legitimate user credentials when users interacted with these actorcontrolled servers.
The diagram below illustrates how we believe the actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign
used DNS hijacking to achieve their end goals.

Operational tradecraft
Initial access
The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign gained initial access either by exploiting
known vulnerabilities or by sending spear-phishing emails. Talos believes that the threat
actors have exploited multiple known CVEs to either gain initial access or to move laterally
within an affected organization. Based on our research, we know the actor utilizes the
following known exploits:
CVE-2009-1151: PHP code injection vulnerability affecting phpMyAdmin
CVE-2014-6271: RCE affecting GNU bash system, specifically the SMTP (this was part of
the Shellshock CVEs)
CVE-2017-3881: RCE by unauthenticated user with elevated privileges Cisco switches
CVE-2017-6736: Remote Code Exploit (RCE) for Cisco integrated Service Router 2811
CVE-2017-12617: RCE affecting Apache web servers running Tomcat
CVE-2018-0296: Directory traversal allowing unauthorized access to Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliances (ASAs) and firewalls
5/13

CVE-2018-7600: RCE for Website built with Drupal, aka "Drupalgeddon"
As of early 2019, the only evidence of the spear-phishing threat vector came from a
compromised organization's public disclosure. On January 4, Packet Clearing House, which
is not an Internet exchange point but rather is an NGO which provides support to Internet
exchange points and the core of the domain name system, provided confirmation of this
aspect of the actors’ tactics when it publicly revealed its internal DNS had been briefly
hijacked as a consequence of the compromise at its domain registrar.
As with any initial access involving a sophisticated actor, we believe this list of CVEs to be
incomplete. The actor in question can leverage known vulnerabilities as they encounter a
new threat surface. This list only represents the observed behavior of the actor, not their
complete capabilities.

Globalized DNS hijacking activity as an infection vector
During a typical incident, the actor would modify the NS records for the targeted
organization, pointing users to a malicious DNS server that provided actor-controlled
responses to all DNS queries. The amount of time that the targeted DNS record was
hijacked can range from a couple of minutes to a couple of days. This type of activity could
give an attacker the ability to redirect any victim who queried for that particular domain
around the world. Other cybersecurity firms previously reported some aspects of this
activity. Once the actor-controlled name server was queried for the targeted domain, it
would respond with a falsified "A" record that would provide the IP address of the actorcontrolled MitM node instead of the IP address of the legitimate service. In some instances,
the threat actors modified the time-to-live (TTL) value to one second. This was likely done to
minimize the risk of any records remaining in the DNS cache of the victim machine.
During 2019, we observe the following name servers being used in support of the Sea Turtle
campaign:

Credential harvesting: Man-in-the-middle servers
Once the threat actors accessed a domain's DNS records, the next step was to set up a manin-the-middle (MitM) framework on an actor-controlled server.
The next step for the actor was to build MitM servers that impersonated legitimate services
to capture user credentials. Once these credentials were captured, the user would then be
passed to the legitimate service. to evade detection, the actors performed "certificate
impersonation," a technique in which the attacker obtained a certificate authority-signed
X.509 certificate from another provider for the same domain imitating the one already used
by the targeted organization. For example, if a DigiCert certificate protected a website, the
threat actors would obtain a certificate for the same domain but from another provider,
such as Let's Encrypt or Comodo. This tactic would make detecting the MitM attack more
difficult, as a user's web browser would still display the expected "SSL padlock" in the URL
bar.
When the victim entered their password into the attacker's spoofed webpage, the actor
would capture these credentials for future use. The only indication a victim received was a
brief lag between when the user entered their information and when they obtained access
to the service. This would also leave almost no evidence for network defenders to discover,
as legitimate network credentials were used to access the accounts.
In addition to the MitM server IP addresses published in previous reports, Talos identified
16 additional servers leveraged by the actor during the observed attacks. The complete list
of known malicious IP addresses are in the Indicators of Compromise (IOC) section below.

Credential harvesting with compromised SSL certificates
Once the threat actors appeared to have access to the network, they stole the organization's
SSL certificate. The attackers would then use the certificate on actor-controlled servers to
perform additional MitM operations to harvest additional credentials. This allowed the
actors to expand their access into the targeted organization's network. The stolen
certificates were typically only used for less than one day, likely as an operational security
measure. Using stolen certificates for an extended period would increase the likelihood of
detection. In some cases, the victims were redirected to these actor-controlled servers
displaying the stolen certificate.
One notable aspect of the campaign was the actors' ability to impersonate VPN applications,
such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) products, to perform MitM attacks. At this
time, we do not believe that the attackers found a new ASA exploit. Rather, they likely
7/13

abused the trust relationship associated with the ASA's SSL certificate to harvest VPN
credentials to gain remote access to the victim's network. This MitM capability would allow
the threat actors to harvest additional VPN credentials.
As an example, DNS records indicate that a targeted domain resolved to an actor-controlled
MitM server. The following day, Talos identified an SSL certificate with the subject common
name of "ASA Temporary Self Signed Certificate" associated with the aforementioned IP
address. This certificate was observed on both the actor-controlled IP address and on an IP
address correlated with the victim organization.
In another case, the attackers were able to compromise NetNod, a non-profit, independent
internet infrastructure organization based in Sweden. NetNod acknowledged the
compromise in a public statement on February 5, 2019. Using this access, the threat actors
were able to manipulate the DNS records for sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net. This redirection allowed
the attackers to harvest credentials of administrators who manage domains with the TLD of
Saudi Arabia (.sa). It is likely that there are additional Saudi Arabia-based victims from this
attack.
In one of the more recent campaigns on March 27, 2019, the threat actors targeted the
Sweden-based consulting firm Cafax. On Cafax's public webpage, the company states that
one of their consultants actively manages the i[.]root-server[.]net zone. NetNod managed
this particular DNS server zone. We assess with high confidence that this organization was
targeted in an attempt to re-establish access to the NetNod network, which was previously
compromised by this threat actor.

Primary and secondary victims

8/13

We identified 40 different organizations that have been targeted during this campaign. The
victim organizations appear to be broadly grouped into two different categories. The first
group of victims, which we refer to as primary victims, were almost entirely located in the
Middle East and North Africa. Some examples of organizations that were compromised
include:
Ministries of foreign affairs
Military organizations
Intelligence agencies
Prominent energy organizations
The second cluster of victim organizations were likely compromised to help enable access to
these primary targets. These organizations were located around the world; however, they
were mostly concentrated in the Middle East and North Africa. Some examples of
organizations that were compromised include:
Telecommunications organizations
Internet service providers
Information technology firms
Registrars
One registry

Notably, the threat actors were able to gain access to registrars that manage ccTLDs for
Amnic, which is listed as the technical contact on IANA for the ccTLD .am. Obtaining access
to this ccTLD registrars would have allowed attackers to hijack any domain that used those
ccTLDs.

How is this tradecraft different?
The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign have proven to be highly capable, as they
have been able to perform operations for over two years and have been undeterred by
public reports documenting various aspects of their activity. This cyber threat campaign
represents the first known case of a domain name registry organization that was
compromised for cyber espionage operations.
In order to distinguish this activity from the previous reporting on other attackers, such as
those affiliated with DNSpionage, below is a list of traits that are unique to the threat actors
behind the Sea Turtle campaign:
These actors perform DNS hijacking through the use of actor-controlled name servers.
These actors have been more aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a
number of registrars, including those that manage ccTLDs.
These actors use Let's Encrypts, Comodo, Sectigo, and self-signed certificates in their
9/13

MitM servers to gain the initial round of credentials.
Once they have access to the network, they steal the organization's legitimate SSL
certificate and use it on actor-controlled servers.

Why was it so successful?
We believe that the Sea Turtle campaign continues to be highly successful for several
reasons. First, the actors employ a unique approach to gain access to the targeted networks.
Most traditional security products such as IDS and IPS systems are not designed to monitor
and log DNS requests. The threat actors were able to achieve this level of success because
the DNS domain space system added security into the equation as an afterthought. Had
more ccTLDs implemented security features such as registrar locks, attackers would be
unable to redirect the targeted domains.
The threat actors also used an interesting techniques called certificate impersonation. This
technique was successful in part because the SSL certificates were created to provide
confidentiality, not integrity. The attackers stole organizations' SSL certificates associated
with security appliances such as ASA to obtain VPN credentials, allowing the actors to gain
access to the targeted network.
The threat actors were able to maintain long term persistent access to many of these
networks by utilizing compromised credentials.
We will continue to monitor Sea Turtle and work with our partners to understand the threat
as it continues to evolve to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is
informed.

Mitigation strategy
In order to best protect against this type of attack, we compiled a list of potential actions.
Talos suggests using a registry lock service, which will require an out-of-band message
before any changes can occur to an organization's DNS record. If your registrar does not
offer a registry lock service, we recommend implementing multi-factor authentication, such
as DUO, to access your organization's DNS records. If you suspect you were targeted by this
type of activity intrusion, we recommend instituting a network-wide password reset,
preferably from a computer on a trusted network. Lastly, we recommend applying patches,
especially on internet-facing machines. Network administrators can monitor passive DNS
record on their domains, to check for abnormalities.

Indicators of Compromise
The threat actors utilized leased IP addresses from organizations that offer virtual private
server (VPS) services. These VPS providers have since resold many of these IP addresses to
various benign customers. To help network defenders, we have included the IP address, as
well as the month(s) that the IP address was associated with the threat actor.
