Name,
On behalf of Cognizant Technology Solutions, I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that involved personal
information relating to you. We regret that this incident occurred and take the security of personal information seriously.
WHAT HAPPENED. We recently discovered that Cognizant was the victim of a ransomware attack carried out by
international cyber criminals through which personal information relating to you was impacted. On April 20, 2020,
Cognizant learned that the attackers staged and likely exfiltrated a limited amount of data from Cognizant’s systems.
Based on our investigation, we understand that this activity occurred between April 9 and 11.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED. We have determined that the personal information involved in this
incident included your name and one or more of: your Social Security number and/or other tax identification number,
financial account information, driver’s license information, and/or passport information.
WHAT WE ARE DOING. Cognizant is taking this security incident very seriously. We have been cooperating with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with their investigation of the cyber criminals responsible for the attack. In
addition to quickly containing the incident, we are also taking various steps to further improve Cognizant’s overall
security posture.
WHAT YOU CAN DO. While we have no reason to believe your personal information has been misused, to assist you
and consistent with certain laws, we are providing you with the following information about general steps that you can
take to protect against potential misuse of personal information.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
You should always remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account
statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or
suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.
In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or law enforcement, including your Attorney
General, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To
learn more, you can go to the FTC’s website, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (4384338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington,
DC 20580.
You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover
information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency
delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”),
you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting
agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877)
322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:
Equifax
(800) 685-1111

You also have other rights under the FCRA. For further information about your rights under the FCRA, please visit:
http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201410_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf.
In addition, you may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and
security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert
can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to
protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one
of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will
notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you can contact the
nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict access to your credit
report:
(1) Equifax – (800) 685-1111
(2) Experian – (888) 397-3742
(3) TransUnion – (888) 909-8872
You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information. After
receiving your request, each credit reporting agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or
password that you will need in order to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.
