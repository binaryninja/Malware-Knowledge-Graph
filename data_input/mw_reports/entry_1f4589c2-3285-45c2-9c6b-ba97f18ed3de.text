Threat Research / October 25, 2021
Joe Slowik &nbsp
Berserk Bear is one of many names for a threat actor operating since at least 2010.
Alternatively referred to or encompassing operations tracked as Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly,
and Iron Liberty, among others, the group is linked by multiple entities to Russian statedirected operations. Throughout over a decade of activity, Berserk operated in a variety of
sensitive environments, from industrial organizations to government entities – but without
any apparent, direct impact.
While recently published research indicates this group may be responsible for inadvertent
disruption as part of its activities in critical infrastructure environments, even absent such
impacts Berserk’s behaviors are cause for concern. Viewed potentially as preliminary
operations necessary for future cyber impacts, Berserk represents a preparatory agent
enabling future, more worrying events.
The implications of Berserk activity for critical infrastructure owners and operators are
significant. Although not directly linked to any known, intended disruptive or destructive
event, the group’s operations cover all necessary steps to position an adversary for such an
operation in the future. For network defenders, a review of this group’s actions is therefore
not merely helpful but for some necessary to guard against this type of threat. In this post,
we will examine network-focused items related to Berserk Bear operations throughout the
group’s history as detailed in recently published research.

Exploit to Credential Leak
Initial Berserk activity, often referred to as the Dragonfly Campaign, utilized exploits as part of
multiple intrusion vectors to gain initial access to victims from at least 2010 through 2014.
After a brief period of quiet, the group returned to action using superficially similar initial
access mechanisms: strategic website compromise (SWC) and phishing campaigns with
malicious attachments. However, unlike earlier activity, post-Dragonfly operations avoided
the use of exploits and instead focused on leaking credentials from victim machines.

Through either reference to external objects in malicious documents or by injecting a
reference to a remotely hosted object in an otherwise legitimate webpage, Berserk operators
worked to harvest credentials by prompting an external authentication attempt from victim
machines. Similar to penetration testing techniques such as use of the Responder tool for
capturing logon information, the technique prompts a victim machine to initiate an outbound
Server Message Block (SMB) query to retrieve a remotely-hosted file object. As part of this
communication, Windows authentication information (the username and NTLM hash) passes
to the remote machine, which an intruder can capture for future replay.
From a defender’s perspective, the first recommendation to avoid such information leakage
is to deny outbound SMB connections (TCP 445). Where such actions are not possible,
external connectivity should be limited to known-necessary networks. Alternatively, such
traffic can be rigorously logged as SMB communications can be leveraged for a variety of
malicious actions beyond the credential leak activity associated with Berserk Bear.
When SMB routes fail, Windows will fail-over to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
(WebDAV) to retrieve the same resource via HTTP. The fail-over communication can be
identified in network traffic via a WebDAV-containing user agent string. Monitoring HTTP
traffic containing a WebDAV-related user agent can reveal these attempts when outbound
SMB traffic is blocked or filtered. While this alone may be insufficient to identify truly
suspicious traffic as legitimate use cases exist, pairing with analysis of infrastructure or
originating application or resource can reveal instances worth further investigation.

Abusing Remote Access
Post-Dragonfly actions associated with Berserk used harvested credentials for both remote
access to victim environments and lateral movement inside compromised networks. More
recent campaigns linked to this entity continue to emphasize credential harvesting,
leveraging a combination of exploits, tools, and standard collection techniques as means to
access logon information. Overall, just as Berserk transitioned from exploits for initial access,
consistent credential gathering and reuse allows the intruder to blend in with normal user
activity and evade easy detection.
Once inside victim networks, Berserk actors create adversary-controlled administrator
accounts and modify system settings to facilitate follow-on access, as well as continuous
password theft and cracking to gather more existing account information. While other
techniques also appear in Berserk-related campaigns in the late 2010s, Berserk operations
from 2018 to the present focus on having steady, reliable access to valid credentials. Berserk
then leverages collected credentials for remote access, lateral movement, as well as for
tactics such as remote process execution using the PSExec tool.
A variety of host-centric controls exist to monitor or limit these techniques. First and
foremost, network owners must deploy and enforce robust multi-factor authentication (MFA)
schema to significantly minimize the risk of account compromise and credential reuse.

Additionally, defenders can monitor system and access logs for unusual activity associated
with specific user accounts, and audit privileged account use within the network.
In addition to these host-based operations, network-centric options also exist to monitor and
track possible credential abuse. For example, especially where host-centric logs may not be
easily accessible or available, mapping authentication pairs – source and destination system
– and associated accounts can identify overall patterns in network traffic. While potentially
overwhelming and unwieldy for covering all remote authentication activity, focusing on
external-to-internal behaviors to track new authentication sources or emphasizing “high
value” internal targets (domain controllers, security tools, or industrial systems) can yield
potentially valuable results. Identifying a new, not previously seen remote access attempt to
the network from an unfamiliar network address (discussed further below) can be the first
touchpoint revealing potential credential loss and a follow-on intrusion attempt. Similarly,
identifying authentication attempts to critical assets from standard user machines in the
network can reveal opportunistic lateral movement activity.
Expanding beyond authentication tracking, defenders can utilize network visibility to enhance
understanding of file movement and process execution as well. Similarly reliant upon
credential access, looking for activity such as share mapping (and subsequent file
movement) or remote process execution via various frameworks is critical to mapping lateral
movement activity. Identifying unusual relationships in such activity, such as file movement
directly between workstations or remote process activity outside of policy and administration
parameters can reveal adversary operations in progress.
Certainly, none of the above items are easy to implement, but represent necessary steps for
network owners and defenders to evolve with adversaries such as Berserk Bear. Luckily,
advances in technology, modeling, and threat analysis mean defenders can take advantage
of robust, mutli-faceted detection of systemic anomalies to reveal adversaries attempting to
“blend in” with normal system operations.

Infrastructure Capture for Communications
Berserk Bear is interesting not just for its activity, but also the nature of the infrastructure
used to carry out that activity. Starting with the Dragonfly campaign, Berserk utilized
compromised, legitimate sites and services for operations. By the later Palmetto Fusion
campaign and follow-on activities, Berserk shifted almost entirely to using compromised
infrastructure for malicious activity.
When procuring network infrastructure, adversaries have two general choices: they can
create their own (lease IP addresses and servers, register domain names, etc.) or leverage a
third party’s existing service. One of the more direct ways of achieving the latter is to simply
compromise someone’s vulnerable system for use in attacks, whether for botnets or as proxy

3/6

nodes for communication. For an adversary, this approach can evade typical defender
analysis and pivoting methodologies by avoiding creation patterns or relative “newness” of
registered domains.
Yet opportunities still exist to differentiate communication pathways provided defenders can
enrich and contextualize these observations. Looking at previously described Berserk
behaviors, such as credential harvesting and follow-on remote access, even if this activity
involves a compromised, otherwise legitimate server, defenders can still identify suspicious
characteristics in the infrastructure to power security-driven decision-making. For example,
defenders can establish profiles of remote access to the monitored network including not just
geography but also service providers and even Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) for
clients. Using this information to then identify items outside the norm, such as the expanded
anomaly approach described previously, or establishing allow-lists preemptively to block
activity outside of existing patterns can defeat activity such as Berserk.
Expanding on this, for remote access activity such as connection to the corporate VPN or
remote access technologies such as RDP or SSH, activity coming from a remote user would
likely originate from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) catering to home users. Observing
such remote access activity from a virtual public server (VPS) or cloud service provider
would be very strange – but also represents a likely pathway for an entity compromising
third-party infrastructure for use as communication relays. By enriching and understanding
communication nodes – essentially, viewing network observables as composite objects –
defenders can build context around observed IP addresses and other items to make
security-focused decisions.

Conclusion
Berserk Bear, in many respects, represents a historical entity in that no publicly known
operations have been attributed to this group since 2020. While some may assume this
group would therefore offer little to defenders right now in terms of lessons learned, closer
investigation reveals Berserk deploying a variety of tactics and techniques that mirror
behaviors associated with current ransomware and other advanced persistent threat entities.
By researching and analyzing Berserk Bear campaigns, defenders can gain significant
insight into adversary tradecraft aligning with abuse of legitimate services and “living off the
land” techniques. Furthermore, understanding is necessary for defenders to take the next
required step: building and deploying detections and defenses against such behaviors.
Network defenders and system owners can use this iterative process of threat analysis and
defense development far more widely. By first understanding how given adversaries operate,
then identifying various detection and identification opportunities associated with observed
capabilities and actions, defenders can ensure coverage of adversary tradecraft. Analysts

can then expand from specific instantiations of tradecraft to more general understanding of
the fundamental behavior for broad-scope defense meeting wider developments across
multiple adversaries.
