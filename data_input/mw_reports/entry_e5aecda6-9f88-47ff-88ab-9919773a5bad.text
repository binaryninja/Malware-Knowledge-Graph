Using DDoS, DanaBot targets Ukrainian Ministry of Defense
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/danabot-launches-ddos-attack-against-ukrainian-ministry-defense

March 7, 2022 Update
DanaBot affiliate ID 5 has stopped DDoSing the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense’s webmail server
and started DDoSing a hardcoded IP address, 138.68.177[.]158. According to Passive DNS data,
this IP address has recently been associated with invaders-rf[.]com. This site claims to be (Google
translated):
“...an information resource of the Office of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine,
which provides information about prisoners of war of the Russian Armed Forces who have invaded
the territory of Ukraine since February 24, 2022. The portal will be available to Russian citizens,
including soldiers' families or acquaintances, to obtain information on the condition and
whereabouts of prisoners.”
Given the threat actor’s previous targeting, this seems like the likely target. The DDoS attack
payload was written and distributed similarly to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense DDoS payload
on March 2, 2022:

Key Points
A threat actor using DanaBot has launched a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
against the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense’s webmail server.
The DDoS attack was launched by leveraging DanaBot to deliver a second-stage malware
payload using the download and execute command.
It is unclear whether this is an act of individual hacktivism, state-sponsored, or possibly a
false flag operation.

DanaBot, first discovered in 2018, is a malware-as-a-service platform where threat actors, known
as affiliates are identified by affiliate IDs. These affiliates purchase access to the platform from
another threat actor who develops the malware and command and control (C2) panel, sets up and
maintains the shared C2 infrastructure, and provides sales and customer support. Affiliates then
distribute and use the malware as they see fit--mostly to steal credentials and commit banking
fraud.
On Wednesday March 2, 2022, in the midst of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the threat
actor identified by the affiliate ID 5 launched an HTTP-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attack against the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense’s webmail server with the URL
hxxps://post.mil.gov[.]ua as shown in Figure 1:

At the time of publication, the webmail server is still online and reachable as shown in Figure 2.

The DDoS attack was launched using DanaBot's download and execute (command 2048 /
subcommand 9) to deliver a new executable with the SHA-256 hash:
b61cd7dc3af4b5b56412d62f37985e8a4e23c64b1908e39510bc8e264ebad700
Similar to DanaBot, the downloaded DDoS executable is written in the Delphi programming
language. Its sole functionality is to implement a bare-bones HTTP-based DDoS attack on a
hardcoded target. The executable is very similar to the one used in another DanaBot DDoS attack
that was documented in November 2021. In that attack, the DanaBot affiliate ID 4 launched a
DDoS attack against a Russian language electronics forum.

Conclusion
While the timing and targeting certainly suggest this new attack is related to the 2022 Russian
invasion of Ukraine, it is unclear whether this is an act of individual hacktivism, something statesponsored, or possibly a false flag operation. If the threat actor’s motive is to attack Ukraine, it is
quite likely that in addition to the DDoS attack, the actor is using DanaBot’s more typical
functionality such as credential theft and document theft against any relevant victims as well.
