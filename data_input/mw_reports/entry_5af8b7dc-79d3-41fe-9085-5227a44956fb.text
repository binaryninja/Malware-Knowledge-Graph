Transcript
[START OF RECORDING]
JACK: I grew up in the US, close to my grandma. She was old and needed medicine, and
often she’d buy her medicine in Mexico. I have many fond memories of taking an all-day road
trip to Mexico, getting across the border, trying to find la farmacia, hoping we’d get the right
medicine there, figuring out a way to get it back over the border, and then driving home. The
thing is, here in the US, medicine is crazy expensive, so making the trip down to Mexico for
medicine was worth it to us. [MUSIC] My grandma was just someone looking for deals and
trying to save money. But this is a common story I’ve heard from other people in the US, too.
Yeah, it’s often illegal to do this, because the US doesn’t want people importing drugs that
aren’t FDA-approved, but still, people do it. But then, another option landed on the table;
pharmacies began to appear online. Suddenly, you could order your medicines from your
computer and get it delivered right to your front door, and that changed everything.
