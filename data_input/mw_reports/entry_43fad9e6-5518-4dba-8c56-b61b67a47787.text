The internet brings endless possibilities for scammers and cyber criminals to make money
illegitimately. The usual suspects – ransomware, business email compromise, internet
fraud, and phishing are well known to the information security community. However, during
a routine vulnerability assessment, Dragos researchers uncovered a smaller in scale
technique targeting industrial engineers and operators.

The Story of Troy and the Password “Cracking” Trojan Horse
Multiple accounts across a variety of social media websites are advertising Programmable
Logic Controller (PLC), Human-Machine Interface (HMI), and project file password cracking
software. Buyers can retrieve forgotten passwords by running an executable provided by
the seller that targets a specific industrial system.
An advertisement like this raises the question, “Who would buy this?” Any information
security professional would caution against downloading and running software from an
untrusted party. Take the following as an example: an engineer named Troy just got
promoted to senior engineer when his old colleague, Hector, retired after serving 30 years
at an electric utility. Troy needs to update some ladder logic Hector wrote on Automation
Direct’s DirectLogic 06 PLC. After firing up the PLC programming software, DirectSOFT, a
password prompt pops up.
Troy doesn’t know the password, and Hector left a few months ago and is now vacationing
on a boat without service indefinitely. Troy looks for answers online, and seeing an
advertisement for PLC password cracking software, decides to give it a go. Cassandra,

Troy’s security-conscience coworker, warns against introducing this unnecessary risk into
their OT environment. But Troy insists this is a time-sensitive task. He purchases the
software and runs it on his engineering workstation.
Troy successfully recovers the PLC password, but a couple of minutes later he discovers
the engineering workstation system is acting strange.

Password Retrieval and a Sality Malware Infection
Troy called in Dragos to reverse engineer the password “cracking” software and determined
it did not crack the password at all, rather, it exploited a vulnerability in the firmware which
allowed it to retrieve the password on command. Further, the software was a malware
dropper, infecting the machine with the Sality malware and turning the host into a peer in
Sality’s peer-to-peer botnet.
The Exploit

Dragos researchers confirmed the password retrieval exploit embedded in the malware
dropper successfully recovers Automation Direct’s DirectLogic 06 PLC password over a
serial connection. From a user’s perspective, they simply need to have a connection from
the Windows machine to the PLC, then specify the COM port to communicate over and
click the “READPASS” button. A second or two later, the password is shown to the user as
seen in Figure 1.

Previous research targeting DirectLogic PLCs has resulted in successful cracking
techniques. However, Dragos found that this exploit does not crack a scrambled version of
the password as historically seen in popular exploitation frameworks. Instead, a specific
byte sequence is sent by the malware dropper to a COM port.

Capturing the serial traffic sent by the exploit allowed Dragos researchers to recreate it
outside of the malware dropper. The malware contains a serial-only version of the exploit,
requiring the user to have a direct serial connection from an Engineering Workstation
(EWS) to the PLC. Dragos researchers were able to successfully recreate the exploit over
Ethernet, increasing the severity of this vulnerability significantly. This vulnerability was
assigned CVE-2022-2003 and was responsibly disclosed to Automation Direct. They have
released a firmware update to fix this issue [source: ICS-CERT Advisory (ICSA-22-167-03),
ICS-CERT Advisory (ICSA-22-167-02)].

The Sality Malware

Sality is a peer-to-peer botnet for distributed computing tasks such as password cracking
and cryptocurrency mining. A Sality infection could risk remote access to an EWS by an
unknown adversary. Dragos assesses with moderate confidence the adversary, while
having the capability to disrupt industrial processes, has financial motivation and may not
directly impact Operational Technology (OT) processes.
Sality employs process injection and file infection to maintain persistence on the host. It
abuses Window’s autorun functionality to spread copies of itself over Universal Serial Bus
(USB), network shares, and external storage drives. This specific sample of Sality also
drops clipboard hijacking malware that, every half second, checks the clipboard for a
cryptocurrency address format. If seen, the hijacker replaces the address with one owned
by the threat actor. This in-real-time hijacking is an effective way to steal cryptocurrency
from users wanting to transfer funds and increases our confidence that the adversary is
financially motivated.
To remain undetected, Sality drops a kernel driver and starts a service to identify any
potential security products such as antivirus systems or firewalls and terminates them.
According to various reports online, Sality is able to conduct Internet Protocol (IP) filtering

against antivirus-related URLs and will drop any outgoing packets containing specific
keywords known to be connected to antivirus vendor websites. This could have regulatory
implications – since Sality blocks any outgoing connections, antivirus systems will not be
able to receive updates violating reliability standard CIP-007-6. While Sality makes several
attempts to stay hidden, it is quite clear that an infection is taking place. Central Processing
Unit (CPU) levels spikes to 100% and multiple Windows Defender alerts were triggered.
The Password “Cracking” Ecosystem

Automation Direct is far from the only vendor affected. In fact, Dragos is aware that this
specific threat actor advertises “cracking” software for several PLCs, HMIs, and project files
listed in the following table:

Dragos only tested the DirectLogic-targeting malware. However, initial dynamic analysis of
a couple of other samples indicate they also contain malware. In general, it appears there is
an ecosystem for this type of software. Several websites and multiple social media
accounts exist all touting their password “crackers.”

Conclusion
Trojanized software is a common delivery technique for malware and has been proven
effective for gaining initial access to a network. While, in our fictitious example, Troy had a
legitimate reason for downloading the password “cracking” software, doing so from an
unknown actor introduced significant and unnecessary risk into the OT environment. If an
engineer needs to recover a lost password, contact Dragos or the respective vendor for
instructions and guidance. As the adage goes, if it’s too good to be true, then it probably is.
