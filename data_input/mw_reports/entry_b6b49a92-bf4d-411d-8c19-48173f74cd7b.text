Spoofed Invoice Used to Drop IcedID

March 28, 2022

Spearphishing crafted with industry-specific terms derived from intelligence gathering techniques
to trick a recipient into opening a file is especially difficult to identify. This is especially true when
an adversary has knowledge of how a business works and the processes that underpin it. Using
this knowledge, a lure can be crafted that takes advantage of these day-to-day processes – for
example, settling the cost of a fuel transaction.
FortiGuard Labs recently encountered such a scenario, where a fuel company in Kyiv, Ukraine
received a spearphishing e-mail that contained an attached invoice—seemingly from another
fuel provider—that was spoofed. The attachment is a zip file that contains the IcedID Trojan.
IcedID has been observed as far back as 2017. Its primary function is to steal banking
credentials and personal information. It is also capable of deploying additional malware from the
same group or partner organizations.

This instance also uses an interesting deployment method. It uses the ISO format, which is
mounted automatically as a disk in Windows. ISO files can also be used to create bootable CDROMs or install an operating system or virtual machine. It also contains a LNK (shortcut file)
used to launch a DLL (Dynamic-link Library).
This blog details the infection process and subsequent malware deployment by the threat actors
behind IcedID.
Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Users: Windows users
Impact: Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor
Severity Level: Medium

The Phishing E-mail
The e-mail originated from an IP address in Belize, at 179[.]60[.]150[.]96. It spoofs the
originating e-mail address to appear to have been sent from another fuel provider in Ukraine.
The e-mail contains both English and Ukrainian elements and looks realistic given the mention
of extra security measures regarding the attachment.
Figure 1. Phishing e-mail.
Attached to the e-mail is a file named “invoice_15.zip”. Extracting the Zip file will drop
“invoice_15.iso” and begin the first phase of infection.

ISO
Windows is capable of mounting iso files as external disks. Doing so will present the user with a
shortcut called “document.” In most cases, the file extension will be hidden from the user,
making it appear as an actual document.

When the full contents of the iso container are revealed, a DLL file can also be seen.

LNK
Figure 4. Shortcut details.
As seen in Figure 4, the shortcut file was created some time prior to the sending of the phishing
e-mail. Additionally, the highlighted area shows what will occur should the shortcut be clicked on
by a user.
In this case, Regsvr32 is used to register “main.dll” with the Windows registry and launch the
code contained within. This action begins the next phase of infection.

Dropper
“main.dll” acts as a dropper for IcedID. Static analysis of the file reveals an interesting point.
Figure 5. Example of strings embedded in “main.dll”
What at appears at first glance to be an easy win for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) because
it contains a domain and IP address, turns out to be slightly more complicated.
Figure 6. Code represented in IDA Pro showing the information from Figure 5.
In comparing the area of code where the strings in Figure 5 are stored, we find that this area is
not called by any functions within “main.dll”. To illustrate this, the right-hand side of the very first
line in Figure 6 contains “Data XREF:”. This indicates that it is referenced elsewhere in the code.
The strings from Figure 5, however, do not include this information, indicating they are not.
By investigating further, the story becomes even more interesting. This code appears in a
StackOverflow question from approximately 10 years ago concerning an issue about
downloading an image over HTTP (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9389183/downloading-apicture-with-http-get-only-downloads-a-small-part-of-it). It should be noted that there is no
malicious intent with the content of that posting.
That it is now part of “main.dll” indicates it is a decoy for analysts in the hope the actual
indicators won’t be blocked.
Figure 7. Information gathering by IcedID.
As can be seen in Figure 7, once running, the malware uses several Windows command-line
tools to obtain information about the local environment. These include capturing the local IP
address (ipconfig), enumerating domain trusts (nltest), and capturing a list of domain
administrators (net group), among others.
The sample then tries to communicate outbound to a command and control (C2) server. There
are multiple addresses the malware can connect to in the event one of the destinations becomes
unavailable.
Figure 8. Network communication.
Figure 9. HTTP GET request.
If a connection to a C2 server has been made, the malware then moves to ensure persistence. It
installs a copy of itself in the user’s temp directory, “%APPDATA%\local\temp”.

Conclusion

3/5

Threat actors that are knowledgeable of their targets are able to increase their chances of
installing an implant within an organization. Based on our observations, the efforts used in this
IcedID attack highlight the groups methodical effort, as evidenced by their research of Ukraine's
retail fuel industry. Additionally, the use of uncommon deployment methods (zipped ISO file) to
establish a foothold—and ultimately gain persistence within an organization—reveals how crafty
the threat actors are able to be to obtain unauthorized access.

Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing
threats:
The FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations
test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices
when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.
In addition to these protections, we suggest that organizations also have their end users go
through our FREE NSE training: NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness. It includes a module
on Internet threats that is designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect
themselves from various types of phishing attacks.
