Ryuk ransomware infections have been observed since late 2018. Ryuk actors are
constantly evolving the TTPs used in Ryuk attributed campaigns. Some of the most notable
targets of these campaigns have been hospitals, government entities, and large
1/9

corporations. The Ryuk adversary group is widely considered to be one of the most
successful and impactful targeting corporations and governments worldwide.

This report is an excerpt of the tactical report from the flagship Andariel platform produced by
the subject matter expert team.

Background
This report illustrates some of the new and existing Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs) of the Ryuk ransomware variants that Advintel has witnessed throughout their
investigations in 2021.

2/9

Initial Attack Vector: RDP Brute Force / Other Means of Initial Attack Vector
Ryuk operators gain initial access to a network most often through two methods in 2021.
Service-Based RDP Compromise
Botnet-Based Malware Delivery
Advintel has noticed an overall increase of RDP compromise as the initial infection vector
across Ryuk-attributed attacks. Threat actors have been observed in the wild employing
large-scale brute force and password spraying attacks against exposed RDP-hosts to
compromise user credentials.
Targeted phishing emails coupled with the support service center calls such as "BazaCall"
have also been observed as an initial infection vector in many Ryuk-attributed attacks. This
weaponized document will have instructions that tell the user to “enable content” which will
3/9

activate a macro and enable the document to download a malicious payload through a
PowerShell script that is executed through a command prompt.

Reconnaissance I: Victim Value Local Reconnaissance Stage
Once a foothold has been established Ryuk operators will attempt to enumerate domain
trusts such as local domains, network shares, users, and Active Directory Organization
Units. During this stage, the actors attempt to gather information about the organization to
determine what resources within the infected domain are of value to perpetrating the rest of
the attack. Bloodhound and AdFind have become popular tools used by actors trying to
enumerate active directory information within an infected domain.

4/9

Reconnaissance II: ZoomInfo and Open Source Target Revenue Enrichment
Advintel has observed actors conducting OSINT research related to the compromised host
domain to identify the infected victim company and evaluate their revenue. Ransomware
operators use the total annual revenue of the victim’s company to assess what the ransom
amount will be. Specifically, actors have been observed searching across services such as
ZoomInfo to retrieve information about the victim company such as technologies used,
recent mergers and acquisitions, corporate hierarchies, personnel, and various other
elements of data related to the company that may be of value to their operations.

Post-Exploitation: Cobalt Strike as Golden Standard Tool
After infection, Ryuk operators utilize Post-Exploitation toolkits such as Cobalt Strike to
conduct further reconnaissance and operation.

Network Breach Possible Roadblocks: Anti-Virus & Endpoint Detection Response
Bypass

5/9

Ryuk operators will utilize information collected by bot scans and their own scans to gain
information about anti-virus (AV) and Endpoint Detection Response (EDR) tools present on
hosts before formulating their attack. It is worth noting that operators will leverage OSINT
methods and communication with other threat actors to gain information on the AV and EDR
systems present in the networks that they are attacking especially if a network has been
previously compromised the information obtained from the attack can be shared between
threat groups. Once the operators successfully compromise a domain administrator account,
they will work to disable AV and EDR services.

Some of the more sophisticated and novel red teaming techniques used to target and bypass
EDR and protection tools:

Hunting for a local IT administrator with access to EDR software and leveraging a
PowerShell tool "KeeThief.ps1" to extract administrator credentials for EDR software
from popular KeePass password manager
Allows for the extraction of KeePass 2.X key material from memory, as well as the
backdooring and enumeration of the KeePass trigger system.

Deploying portable Notepad++ version to run PowerShell scripts on the host system
to bypass PowerShell executionrestriction. The portable Notepad++ includes
PowerShell version1.

Host Privilege Escalation
Advintel has witnessed two new TTPs relative to Ryuk ransomware campaigns that
organizations should monitor closely as a means of detecting infections within their domain.

CVE-2018-8453
CVE-2018-8453 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows when the win23k.sys
component fails to properly handle objects in memory. The exploitation of this vulnerability
allows an attacker to run an arbitrary kernel with read/write privileges.

CVE-2019-1069
6/9

CVE-2019-1069 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that leverages the way Windows Task
Scheduler handles saved tasks. Task Scheduler stores tasks as files in two locations,
C:\Windows\Tasks and C:\Windows\System32\Tasks. If an RPC client modifies a task using
the service in the C:\Windows\Tasks location when modifications are saved the task will be
migrated to C:\Windows\System32\Tasks. When saving a task file, the Task Scheduler
service will set ownership and full control of the file to the owner of the task. This process
allows an attacker to perpetrate a hard link attack. Therefore, if an attacker manually places
a file within C:\Windows\Tasks the attacker will be able to run this file with the highest level of
privilege since the Task Scheduler service runs at the maximum level of privilege defined by
the local machine.

Lateral Movement
Ryuk operators demonstrate high levels of sophistication in their abilities to gather
information and move laterally within a network. Specific built-in tools of the Cobalt Strike
toolkit have been witnessed being executed by actors including DACheck, and Mimikatz. A
script “Invoke-DACheck” has been witnessed being used to identify domain admin accounts
within the network. Actors will also use Mimikatz and LaZagne to collect passwords.

Advintel has recently witnessed Ryuk actors using CrackMapExec for local admin hunting
and password extraction. CrackMapExec is a publicly available post-exploitation tool with a
variety of enumeration, discovery, and brute force capabilities. It is likely that actors are using
this tool to search for local admin accounts and then executing SMB and NTLM relay attack
functions from this tool for authentication.

Ransomware Deployment
Once actors have successfully compromised a local or domain admin account, they
distribute the Ryuk payload through Group Policy Objects, PsExec sessions from a domain
controller, or by utilizing a startup item in the SYSVOL share.

Risk Mitigation Recommendations
Detections for use of Mimikatz and PsExec execution within the network.
Detections and alerts for the presence of AdFind, Bloodhound, and LaZagne within the
network.

7/9

Ensure all operating systems and software are up to date with the latest updates and
security patches.
Implement multi-factor authentication for RDP access.
Implement network segmentation and controls to scrutinize SMB and NTLM traffic
within the network.
Routinely review account permissions to prevent privilege creep and maintain principle
of least privilege.
Routinely review Group Policy Objects and logon scripts.
Update systems to prevent exploitation of CVE-2018-8453 and CVE-2019-1069.

Conclusion

Ryuk ransomware campaigns continue to evolve their TTPs to avoid detection and navigate
throughout a network in 2021. Advintel continues to observe threat actors discussing new
TTPs amongst themselves and will continue to monitor their communications to provide intel
to prevent these campaigns from being perpetrated successfully.
