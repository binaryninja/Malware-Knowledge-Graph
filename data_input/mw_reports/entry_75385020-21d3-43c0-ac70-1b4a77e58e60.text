What’s going on with Lapsus$
By Adam Parsons, CYFIRMA Cyber Threat Intelligence

Lapsus$ has hit the headlines recently partly due to the mega-corporations that they appear
to have successfully hacked and partly due to the claims that they are or were led by a 16year-old.
Indeed, there have been a number of arrests, most recently a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old
appeared in court in the UK charged with a number of cyber offenses. However, as the
above post on their telegram chat group shows they have no intention no of stopping.
The telegram channel was their only official communication method where they have
published stolen data, and in at least one instance, held a vote on who to attack next.

1/6

The group chat is used to share stolen data (not linked to Lapsus$), tools and requests for
hacking help. However, the channel is not quite a wild west…there are rules:
1. No porn
2. Not too much trolling
3. No spam
But outside of these rules anything goes…

The channel is not just for English speakers, there are a significant number of users
communicating in Portuguese. This is potentially a throwback to the first few public victims of
Lapsus$ being the Ministério da Saúde do Brasil (Ministry of Health of Brazil) and latterly
Portugal’s Impresa media group.

2/6

Given that the rise of Lapsus$ has coincided with the downfall of Raidforums, a popular
entry-level hacking forum, it appears that the Lapsus$ chat has attracted a significant
number of like-minded individuals.
The telegram group still bears the name of its initial victim (https://t.me/saudechat), we can
assume that it was initially set up to share the stolen data from the Ministério da Saúde do
Brasil. That has long since passed, but still, the attacks keep coming even after what many
thought would be arrested that would bring about their downfall. Likewise, the doxing of one
of the supposed main members of the group has also not stopped their progress.
Given the naming of the telegram channel, we can assume that their ongoing activity was not
planned. One would expect that they are making it up as they go along, thinking barely one
step ahead. This may be one reason law enforcement is having such problems shutting them
down. There is no plan, victims are targets of opportunity and profit is not the main
motivation.
It has been reported that members of the group originate from the Sim Swapping world, a
relatively small sub-section of the hacking community that is specifically focused on illegally
obtaining control of phone numbers and subsequently control of their linked social media
accounts. These social media accounts have then been used in several high-profile scams
often involving crypto. Alternatively, sim swaps have been used to gain control of specific
users’ social media accounts due to a unique Twitter or Instagram handle that can then be
sold in online forums. Much like Lapsus$, individuals arrested in sim swapping are largely of
a similar youthful age.
This might explain the brazen attacks against mega-corporations and so far their lack of
interest in regularly using these attacks for financial gain or at least it does not appear to be
their main motive. Hacks of Okta and Microsoft are by far more valuable than even the most
high-profile Twitter handle. The reasons for these attacks are quite bizarre. The hack of
Nvidia was followed by a demand to remove all Lite Hash Rate (LHR) limitations to its
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hash rate that prevents faster crypto mining activities. It
also wanted Nvidia to publish the base codes of its GPU drivers as open-source, making
them publicly accessible and openly modifiable forever. Neither of these demands would
directly benefit Lapsus$ and seem more targeted at pleasing their fans and enhancing their
reputation amongst the community.

How are they doing….what they do!
There have been a number of in-depth reports on how Lapsus$ has evaded the defenses of
their victims. Researching the group, we discovered how incredibly simple some of their
methods were.
The technical skills and social engineering techniques bear resemblance to those used in the
sim swapping world, which is after all where they first got started.

3/6

Lapsus$ group put out a call on their telegram channel to employees at potential victim
companies, as seen below:

Whilst this was widely mocked in cybercriminal communities for the lack of hacking prowess
it takes to recruit insiders to simply give you access, it has been reported that this was in fact
the reason Microsoft fell prey to the attack. Lapsus$’s approach may seem less sophisticated
compared with advanced threats groups, but as we have witnessed, they are a force to be
reckoned with. Given that Lapsus$ appears to have used this technique as early as
November 2021, we can easily assume that it has been more successful than reported.
Aside from this, Lapsus$ techniques are a throwback to their sim swapping days and revolve
around social engineering techniques.

Lapsus$’s methods – they seem so easy

4/6

Sim swapping involves obtaining control of a victim’s phone number by tricking the phone
service provider to transfer the phone number and therefore control to another device as per
the above illustration. This method requires a significant level of knowledge of potential
questions posed by the phone service provider and their requisite and often personal
answers. Lapsus$ likely makes use of openly available data through social media and
previously breached data to answer these questions.
Once the number has been transferred, threat actors can then get access to most if not all
the victim’s linked accounts through password resetting via the transferred phone number
where the phone number is used as a method of recovery. Email accounts often hold
valuable information, including account details, passwords and answers to security
questions. Lapsus$ has also been reported to deploy Redline malware, a password and
session token stealer.
There is another avenue much like sim swapping where it requires the threat actor to make a
call impersonating the victim. The hacker will call the employee’s IT department and attempt
to have their password reset. Depending on the security stance of the organization, this often
requires answering numerous questions which are personal to the victim.
Once the victim’s password has been obtained, there is another line of defense.
Multifactor Authentication (MFA) or 2-factor authentication (2FA) comes in many forms as it
is an additional security measure should a password be leaked or otherwise obtained by an
unauthorized party. MFA requires the approval or authentication on an additional device to
grant access.
Once an employee password is known, the group would need to pass MFA. Should they
have access to the victim phone number and MFA is linked to the compromised number,
access can be obtained. If this is not the case, then there are a number of other methods
that can be used.

5/6

Spamming employees with push requests and automated calls to get MFA approval is one
such method. Lapsus$ even brag about this technique on their channel “Call the employee
100 times at 1 AM while he is trying to sleep, and he will more likely to accept it. Once the
employee accepts the call, you can access the MFA enrolment portal and enroll another
device”
Whilst bombarding an employee with MFA requests creates a lot of noise and could
potentially alert the victim, there are other stealthy methods at play. One such method
involves sending MFA push requests a few times a day, hoping the employee’s guard drops
momentarily.
Opting for more advanced MFA such as FIDO2 provides a higher degree of security. FIDO2
requires the authentication to be performed on the device that is used to log in, making
remote logging in on any other device ineffective.
Of course, awareness by employees of these techniques is key. Suspicion should
immediately be raised if an unrequested MFA notification is received. Likewise, IT staff must
remain vigilant to suspicious password resets requests. Staying updated on what is shared
online on social media and awareness of any personal data that has been leaked will help
avoid becoming a victim.

So what’s next from Lapsus$?
As we have seen, law enforcement coming down on Lapsus$ has not stopped the group’s
activities. We can assume a leadership group is controlling the telegram channel rather than
an individual. One would expect that it is a point of pride that the channel stays up despite
law enforcement action. The group has a plan to use Element.io instant messaging platform
as a backup should their Telegram channel shut down.
In the meantime, the channel continues to grow, as Lapsus$ have triumphantly noted that
their telegram chat group now has over 30,000 members. Should the leadership group be
taken down, it would not be out of the question for one of these members to form their own
Lapsus$ franchise if they have not already done so. The added humiliation of a multinational
corporation being hacked by a group most associated with teenagers doing it for the ‘Lolz’
would make the Lapsus$ name an attractive brand.
APTS have imaginative animals as their mascot, Hacktivists have Guido Fawkes masks, will
malicious teenagers use the Lapsus$ name as their logo?
If we were to illustrate a picture of the Lapsus$ group based on their history and current
trajectory, we should draw a multi-headed hydra, each head laughing as Law Enforcement
arrests teenager after teenager, and the regrown heads hack their way through the
sophisticated defenses of company after company……just for the Lolz.
