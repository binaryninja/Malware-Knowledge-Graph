GoDaddy has responded to this research here, with this statement (lightly redacted, red
highlights were added to note ridiculous statements):

Zach,
[redacted] brought your post to my attention. While this isn’t the right forum to dive
deep into your article, there’s a few things I want to make clear:
We will not be filing another SEC incident about a breach any time soon
You are seeing Black Hat SEO tactics on several hosting accounts, across
different platforms, including several platforms that were completely unrelated to
our recent Managed WordPress incident.
wsimg.com was not meant to and no longer resolves
Customers are responsible for the content of their websites. We’re reaching out
to the customers you mentioned in your post and are alerting them to the
presence of Black Hat SEO on their websites and are recommending steps to
clean up their website and protect themselves from further attacks.
Thank you again for taking the time to raise this and please reach out if you have any
other questions. Since this is unrelated to the SSL incident, I would ask that you
contact me directly.
Thanks,
[redacted]
If you’ve come here to read a clean description of a deeply technical data supply chain
problem, impacting millions of websites across the globe, including dozens if not hundreds of
U.S. Government domains, and hoping to read all the answers about how it’s happening…
then you are going to be disappointed.
These problems are very complicated, and there are a few things in this research that I still
don’t totally understand.
But I’ll say confidently: something is very, very wrong with GoDaddy infrastructure.
Today. Right now. I’ve attempted to report these problems to several entities/orgs for a good
chunk of 2021, nothing has been fixed, and the problems seem to be growing. More and
more government websites are being attacked, and no one seems to have figured out “the
reason”…until now…
Currently, there are malicious content injections, documented in this research below,
impacting organizations like:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
The National Institute of Health (NIH)

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
The U.S. Government Publishing Office
The U.S. Defense Department’s “Defense Technical Information Center” (DOD DTIC)
The Minnesota National Guard
The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information
The House Education & Labor Committee
Senator Jon Tester’s Official Senate Website
The State of Washington
The Maryland State Archives
The New Jersey Court System
The City of Vallejo, California
California’s San Diego Superior Court
The Humble, Texas County School District
The South Carolina State Library Digital Collections
The Crossroads, Texas City Government
The Liberty Hill, Texas City Government
The District of Columbia’s “Department for-hire Vehicles”
The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife
The City of Walpole, Massachusetts
The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
The City of Clifton, Virginia
The McCracken County, Kentucky County Schools
The City of Auburn, New York
And many more
One fact is clear: on November 22, 2021, GoDaddy reported to the SEC that a wide-ranging
security incident had taken place across their Managed WordPress Service [Source Link
from SEC filing], which GoDaddy “discovered” on November 17, 2021. The report claims that
“beginning on September 6, 2021, the unauthorized third party used the vulnerability to gain
access to the following customer information:”
“Up to 1.2 million active and inactive Managed WordPress customers had their email
address and customer number exposed. The exposure of email addresses presents
risk of phishing attacks.”
“The original WordPress Admin password that was set at the time of provisioning was
exposed. If those credentials were still in use, we reset those passwords.”
“For active customers, sFTP and database usernames and passwords were exposed.
We reset both passwords.”
“For a subset of active customers, the SSL private key was exposed. We are in the
process of issuing and installing new certificates for those customers.”

For a little reader context – for nearly two years now, I’ve been researching and attempting to
report niche technical vulnerabilities being exploited by specific types of “Canadian
pharmacy” scammer rings – the groups are focusing attacks on governments, schools,
churches, and nonprofits — domains of trust. Vice did a writeup on some of this research
back in September 2021, and focused on an exploit in the niche CMS “Laserfiche” which was
being exploited by these “Canadian pharmacy” scammer rings.
Since that research was released, I haven’t stopped the research into these foreign pill
pushers exploiting U.S. government websites but narrowed my focus on an x-files worthy
black helicopter – the Loch Ness Monster of malicious redirects. Something out there has
been lurking beneath the surface and creating malicious redirects in uncommonly creative
ways on government websites.
You can watch this dynamic monster redirection in this video I recently captured where the
Auburn, New York government website had a malicious redirect and content injection due to
an attack via this Godaddy-hosted domain “aqits.com” which was dynamically choosing
multiple final “Canadian Pharmacy” scam domains to send the user to:
This spammer monster seems to have potentially been fed a bunch of GoDaddy websites
due to a decision that GoDaddy made in 2017 to inject cross-site JavaScript into all their
client domains pages without permission via the domain “wsimg.com.” The malicious actors
potentially are using some persistent access on wsimg.com to compromise the domains that
GoDaddy reported to the SEC, and attack other U.S. government websites. This group
seems to control something on the “wsimg.com” domain – which GoDaddy currently owns
and has deeply integrated across all of their managed WordPress infrastructure, including
their login pages – and this access is seemingly making it possible for these malicious actors
to orchestrate their redirects and content injections across a scary number of GoDaddyhosted domains, and then using these hosts to attack more domains.
GoDaddy’s decision and numerous negative comments from developers in 2017 can be
found in intimate detail in a fantastic blog post, “GoDaddy hacks WordPress sites, says it’s
‘Monitoring performance’” – I’d strongly urge reading the whole post (including the comments
from people dealing with it in real time).

4/114

GoDaddy’s 2017 decision to inject cross-site JavaScript payloads into client domains without
notice or permission was described by one developer as, “it broke every single AMP page
in my setup” and another person said “I was scanning the sources for checks of
malware as well, and found this injected script. Am actually fine with monitoring
performance… but not with secretive injected coding.” Another potential European user
wrote in the comments of that Holy Cow Marketing article in 2019 ”I was poking around my
new godaddy hosting and found that this is opt in. That’s on uk.godaddy.com which may be
different to godaddy.com.”

5/114

The code injected into all of the GoDaddy WordPress sites includes payloads from the URLs
“secureserver.net” and also “wsimg.com” as seen in this screenshot from the article:

Crucial network request captured in live .gov compromise of the Auburn,
New York Government website shows Godaddy’s “wsimg.com/tcc” initiates
dynamic redirects

When clicking on a “live malicious redirect” in Google Search Results which is actively turned
on for a specific government domain, like the Auburn, New York, Government during recent
tests, malicious content and URL redirections are injected via the Godaddy domain

6/114

wsimg.com – if you can capture it (countless dynamic malicious rules stop this and prevent
capture) – you will see a flow of the network requests like:
1. Google search result click
2. Requests .gov resource page with a location response header that redirects the user
3. User redirected to compromised Godaddy domain like
http://www.aqits.com/auburntaxes.html with initiation requests that indicate this is the
page that fires off the GoDaddy wsimg.com URls with exploits:

4. A “JavaScript file” that has no response body hosted on the GoDaddy infrastructure fires
off like “https://img1.wsimg.com/tcc/tcc_l.combined.1.0.6.min.js”
5. A favicon from the original orchestration domain fires off, this one from
http://www.aqits.com/favicon.ico
6. A final “Canadian pharmacy” landing page will load, this one with
“https://globmedcent.com/search.html?key=viagra&t=p148_mrel&dummy=best” as the URL
7. In the video captured of this live malicious redirect, numerous “final URLs” were found –
which is very common – the dynamic orchestration attacking these domains rotates through
hundreds of final scam domains. https://youtu.be/XgCUZIMHqnw
This wsimg.com domain has 22 subdomains active according to the SecurityTrails report
here. Each of these subdomains, if compromised by malicious actors, create unique risks for
the entire domain – and the same problems exist for any domains like the “iarugby.com”
domain which is mapped via DNS records into this core wsimg.com infrastructure. To read a
refresher on CNAME risks, here’s a great primer from Analytics expert Simo Ahava, “What’s
in a CNAME” (disclaimer: the piece mentions some of my research in this area).

7/114

Many of the subdomains listed above seem to have potential problems (content + SSL +
PHP problems), especially based on the “resulting attacks” flowing from GoDaddy hosted
servers. But none of the subdomains seems as “infected” as the “img2.wsimg.com”
subdomain, which according to Google search results, is *literally* only hosting malicious
PDF content:

8/114

It appears as though 100% of the content uploaded to “img2.wsimg.com” contains malicious
PDFs that promise scam offers, with links in the PDFs that contain malicious redirects to final
scam domains. Here is an example PDF uploaded into this subdomain:

The Godaddy-Hosted Domain Malicious Redirects “Feel Like Magic”
For folks who doesn’t conduct data supply chain research, or hunt for compromised
infrastructure being used by spammers, it may not immediately be clear how odd and
challenging the process can sometimes be to figure out how something is occurring –
spammers can be technical experts who are hunting for specific types of technical
vulnerabilities, and they always *weaponize a weakness* – open redirects don’t last forever,
and most of the spammers operate in a “use it or lose it” manner, where they sometimes “go
a little too hard” and upload hundreds or thousands of compromised documents/pages, with
malicious redirects, or create a similar number of cached URls from a search bug – these
efforts are usually found relatively quickly. I’ve previously reported hundreds of subdomains
that were compromised on massive companies / banks, which were hosting some of these
malicious redirection payloads for a specific spammer group. And many types of malicious
redirects, are merely “open redirects” – a technical vulnerability which is oftentimes

10/114

considered a low threat (generally correct), but it is also still a profitable technical exploit, so
ignoring these efforts sometimes leads to exploits lasting longer “in the wild” without any
clear genesis for the compromises.
As I’ve seen takedowns of malicious redirects on government infrastructure, and personally
identified niche CMS and plugin weaknesses and reported them to various organizations for
remediation, there has remained one “Canadian pharmacy” spammer ring pushing malicious
redirects that felt like magic. Some of the behaviors that you will experience when auditing
the compromised infrastructure includes:
1. When viewing specific Google search results (details below, not sharing malicious
links just yet!), you will see PDF files that appear to be hosted on a U.S. government
domain – the vast majority of these are on the domain suffix “.us” – aka, not on the .gov
domain suffix (a few current injections are on .mil … the domain for the U.S. military…
eek!). When you click on these files, one of two things will happen:
1. The pdf files will open as-expected on the unique .us domain (or whatever
“correct” domain there is for that government agency)
2. The pdf files will redirect through a secondary domain that was hosting a mirrored
copy of the government PDF, and then redirect the user into a series of 1-2-3
malicious redirects before dumping them into a “Canadian pharmacy” scam
website.
2. When viewing specific Google search results, if you view the “Google cached version”
of the pages for a file that is hosting one of the malicious redirects described in step #1,
you will see a URL clash between the destination URL and the file hosted URL.
3. If you experience both #1 and #2, if you check who is hosting the website for the “file
hosted URL” described in step #2, for some “kinda odd reason,” you will find it’s always
hosted by Godaddy in one of their managed hosting providers (WordPress, Drupal,
HTML templates).
Here is where things get even more odd – the research you see above, I’ve been
documenting this happening since July 2021 – and there seemed to be plenty of proof that
this was happening for potentially months (or more) before I first noticed it.
Another way to say that: the injections / malicious redirects that I was documenting that were
impacting government websites, and also inexplicably connected to GoDaddy infrastructure,
seems to have been occurring before the window that GoDaddy reported to the SEC in
November of this year – and it’s unclear to me whether these are two separate problems, but
it seems like there is a GoDaddy dumpster fire and many of their domains are finding ways
to attack government infrastructure in order to create malicious redirects for “Canadian
pharmacy” scammers.
Part of this research involves a domain “wsimg.com” that you’ll find firing JavaScript across
the internet due to a GoDaddy test in 2017, which created unprecedented problems due to
what appears to be some type of compromise on that domain.
11/114

Before we get into the details, I want to make sure it is clear that GoDaddy is quite possibly
one of the largest and most complex businesses on the internet, due to a few of their
subsidiaries and product lines having overlapping ownership and technical resources – along
with the complexity from GoDaddy’s “easy website hosting products” that compliments their
core domain registration products.
To provide additional background for this research, one of those (not awesome priced)
“Domain Reports” was purchased from a service providing a historical WHOIS record,
hosting and connected domain history, for the wsimg.com domain – which has been
owned by GoDaddy since 2008, although as this research will show, potentially
compromised in some way, sometime recently. I also heavily use SecurityTrails.com DNS
records.
GoDaddy first registered the wsimg.com domain in March 2008 – and it’s registered
through their reseller arm of Wild West Domains. It’s unclear why the ownership/registration
is structured this way –it’s odd – but doesn’t necessarily seem nefarious. It is what it is:

12/114

The “Connected Domains” report confirms that wsimg.com shares an IP address with both
iacustombags.com and iarugby.com, which could also be seen in this Security Trails list for
their actual IP address @ https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.178.222.3 – you can also still to
this day attempt to navigate directly to wsimg.com and you will be redirected to a “Custom
Canvas Bag” website owned by an entrepreneur who likely has no idea what could be
happening on their infrastructure that is mapped into this crucial GoDaddy domain.

wsimg.com redirects to iarugby.com – Right Now – Still to this Day

13/114

Here are some of the “known” details about this potential global data supply chain
injection and the GoDaddy products that are involved:
Only a fraction of GoDaddy’s total domains use their “easy website” products –
so this would not be impacting the full 84 million Godaddy domains. GoDaddy
was founded in 1997 and they have updated public marketing materials for many
years, and currently are claiming to have “20+ million customers … with 84+ million
domains.” [Source link from GoDaddy]
GoDaddy formed a wholly-owned subsidiary called “Wild West Domains” in 2002
[Source Link from Wild West Domains] which continues to provide reseller services for
GoDaddy domains – Wild West-itself owns the wsimg.com domain according to Wild
West’s own records (https://rdap.wildwestdomains.com/v1/domain/WSIMG.COM).
Some aspects of this architecture should raise eyebrows for antitrust researchers, but it
should also raise interesting questions for security researchers seeing as the
“wsimg.com” domain, which has long been owned by GoDaddy, was at some-point
migrated to Wild West Domains, where it may have not received the same technical
attention as other core GoDaddy technical products (and thus lead to a compromise on
this domain).
In November 2021, GoDaddy admitted in SEC filings (TechCrunch coverage) that their
WordPress hosting environment had been compromised and 1.2 million customers
were impacted. Based on other public GoDaddy customer/website client details, this
could have impacted up to 5 million WordPress websites (but it appears not total
number of sites, only total customers, has ever been made public).
GoDaddy released details of the attack to the media, and the compromise
exposed original WordPress admin passwords, SFTP credentials, usernames
and passwords for WordPress databases, and some SSL private keys.

14/114

In September 2017, GoDaddy made the very unfortunate decision to inject JavaScript
payloads into their Managed WordPress client domains, with a payload that included
this URL @ https://img1.wsimg.com/tcc/tcc_l.combined.1.0.6.min.js and a commented
note from GoDaddy injected into the websites that said, “// Monitoring performance to
make your website faster. If you want to opt-out, please contact web hosting support.”
A great writeup on the 2017 GoDaddy injection can be found at Holy Cow Online
Marketing @ https://www.holycowonlinemarketing.com/websitedevelopment/godaddy-hacks-wordpress-sites-says-monitoring-performance/ –
the 2017 writeup includes details about how they eventually realized the domain
“wsimg.com” is owned by GoDaddy.

15/114

Today, if you navigate directly to “wsimg.com” – the domain that GoDaddy used to host
JavaScript files they injected into millions of their WordPress client websites in 2017,
you will be redirected to a new domain, “iarugby.com” – which is a clone of the content
on “iacustombags.com” – this domain appears to be owned by a Washington State
entrepreneur, who also owns https://allseasonpartytents.com/ and several other
domains that are built on GoDaddy’s website builder. Attempts to contact the domain
owner were unsuccessful, and there is no indication that the owner is significantly
technical or aware of any problems associated with their domains. But any malicious
actor who compromises the current “iarugby.com” domain would likely have deep
control over the entire wsimg.com domain, which is like using a wet sponge to protect
Fort Knox.
It’s extremely odd that this domain “wsimg.com” – when navigating directly to the raw
domain – will always seemingly redirect to the Rugby website “iarugby.com”
homepage, but minor additions with a directory in the URL, and a WordPress install will
be exposed, like this URL @ http://wsimg.com/directory/break-redirect which won’t
redirect. If you attempt to connect to this same URL with “https” at the front, an SSL
conflict is exposed which indicates the SSL on “wsimg.com” is actually from
“iarugby.com”

16/114

According to Facebook’s Certificate Tracker
(https://developers.facebook.com/tools/ct/search/), this “wsimg.com” domain has
numerous subdomains which continues to have active SSLs issued, which are still
valid as of writing this research and associated with known-GoDaddy Certificate
Authorities:

Notice that the subdomain “blobby.wsimg.com” has an active SSL, which could be
associated with a “blob” / Kubernetes instance from GoDaddy.

17/114

The wsimg.com domain, along with several subdomains on the “iacustombags.com”
domain (mail.*, whm.*, cpanel.*, webdisk.*) are all mapped to the same IP address
“68.178.222.3” with all domains hosted by GoDaddy
(https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.178.222.3).

GoDaddy’s Managed WordPress admins login to their service, which GoDaddy noted
was compromised in Fall 2021, via @ https://sso.secureserver.net/ – on this login page,
still to this day, a total of 11 JavaScript files are embedded into the page and
collect/fire data into the “wsimg.com” domain.

18/114

One of the JavaScript files which collects data on this GoDaddy Managed WordPress
Login page (this JS file @ “https://img1.wsimg.com/auth/v1/static/4128/js/src/trackjs.js”
, includes a comment and code that specifically mentions attempts by GoDaddy
developers to “remove token and username from URL being logged to track JS” –
this section of the code is alarming:
// remove token and username from url being logged to track js
payload.url = payload.url.replace(/token=[^&$]*/, “token=redacted”).replace(/username=
[^&$]*/, “username=redacted”);
Currently, the wsimg.com domain has a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) that prevents
emails from being sent through this domain, which seems to have been updated ~7
months ago to this:

19/114

From 2014 until June 2021, the wsimg.com domain’s SPF records included an allowlist
with hard coded IP addresses. Many of these IP addresses are actively hosting other
domains (Example @ https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/69.64.33.132) which don’t seem
to be owned by GoDaddy. This SPF architecture seems to have allowed emails to be
sent as though they were from “wsimg.com” from countless other GoDaddy domains,
even though this “wsimg.com” domain was an internal logging domain used to inject
JavaScript across millions of GoDaddy client domains in 2017.
This architecture seems ripe for abuse, although specific spam campaigns have
not been found. The compromise of wsimg.com could potentially have occurred
from this SPF architecture, although there would likely need to be other
vulnerabilities or phishing campaigns from it. Two of the IP ranges included in the
SPF records for the domain hosted other websites/content that GoDaddy did not
seem to control:
SPF Records on Wsimg.com until mid 2021 (source @
https://securitytrails.com/domain/wsimg.com/history/txt):
v=spf1 ip4:207.200.21.144/28 ip4:12.151.77.31 ip4:69.64.33.132
ip4:68.233.77.16 ip4:184.168.131.0/24 ip4:173.201.192.0/24 ip4:182.50.132.0/24
ip4:170.146.0.0/16 ip4:174.128.1.0/24 ip4:173.201.193.0/24 include:spf2.domaincontrol.com -all
69.64.33.132 is one of the IP Address ranges permitted to send emails through the
wsimg.com domain, with other public domains hosted on it
(https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/69.64.33.132).

20/114

68.233.77.16 also had public domains @ https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.233.77.16

21/114

For a period of time, until relatively recently a Drupal install changelog was hosted @
http://wsimg.com/CHANGELOG.txt which indicated that it hadn’t been updated since
2018. This was removed recently and unfortunately a copy wasn’t archived during the
initial research, nor did any Google Cache/Internet Archive capture it.

U.S. Government Websites being Attacked with Content Injections
and Malicious Redirects via GoDaddy-Hosted Domains
Details below include proof of specific injections and notes that seemed significant…
NationalMesonet.us, aka the Congressionally-funded “National Mesonet Program”
uses GoDaddy’s Managed WordPress Pro+ – Compromise Highlights Much Larger
Network (https://securitytrails.com/domain/nationalmesonet.us/dns) as per DNS records, the
NationalMesonet.us domain has content on their current website hosted by GoDaddy’s
“secureservercdn.net” domain, which GoDaddy itself notes can be used for their “Zone URL
CDN bundled with Managed WordPress Pro+” product @
https://www.godaddy.com/help/what-is-a-cdn-32168

22/114

The NationalMesonet.us domain comes up in site search results for a spammer keyword like
“viagra” with about a dozen results that look like this:

23/114

24/114

For each of these results on the NationalMesonet.us domain, if you click to view the “current
page” you won’t see any of the spam keywords or content.
But for each of these Google search results, if you click on the three dots next to the results
and look for results that still have a Google Cached page, you will see injected content into
page templates like in this screenshot, which can currently be viewed here on Google and
cached in the Way Back Machine here.

If you review the content injected into these GoDaddy WordPress pages specifically on this
“NationalMesonet.us” cached page, there are some very unique phrases associated with
their pill scams, including these phrases:
“Fildena is a PDE5-inhibitor”
“Vinpocetine not only acts on the areas”
“hokey cure-alls and dubious panaceas”

25/114

If you Google any of these phrases in quotes, you will find lists of compromised domains –
countless domains – and they all have one thing in common … Each and every domain in
these search results are hosted on GoDaddy and seem to all be using the GoDaddy
Managed Hosting products…

Recent Injections Abound from Compromised Godaddy Domains – Active
Malicious Redirections
For many of the domains listed above, if you click on the Google search results you will be
redirected into a Canadian pharmacy site *and* there are content injections cached from
Google, like in this screenshot:

38/114

For some of these domains, if you click to view the search results from the Google search
results page, you will be immediately redirected into a Canadian pharmacy scam website like
in the GIF below:

39/114

For some of the other domains within this same list of previously compromised
domains/pages, if you click on the results, you will be brought to a clean looking page, as
though the infection was cleaned up already (which is potentially the case for some of the
domains). But for some of the domains with “clean results” the websites are extremely out of
date with other very obvious problems, like this one:

40/114

The Google cached page on this “instantcreditbuilder.net” domain that was compromised by
these “Canadian pharmacy” scammers was captured on just December 17, 2021, and you
can see what that looked like here in the Google cache or here in the Way Back Machine.
Here is a screenshot of that injection in this severely outdated domain hosted on GoDaddy:

41/114

So did a domain that still has a Flash banner on the homepage to this day and other
extremely dated content/language, which was compromised on December 17, 2021 (13 days
ago as of this writing) according to the Google cached search results, suddenly fix this
problem and remove the compromised content? Or is something else happening here?)
When researching these GoDaddy WordPress domain compromises, I’ve consistently seen
results and timing like this, where the facts allude to a website that has not cleaned up their
own messes, so either GoDaddy is quietly updating client domains and cleaning up
compromises (which is always one possible reason), or the spam compromises on these
domains are “unpublishing compromises” and breaking redirects in unique ways?
There are many indicators that some type of orchestration like this is taking place, but it’s
quite tough to prove!.. But more details below…
—————————————————————-

42/114

Numerous government domains are hosting injected content for
“Canadian Pharmacy” scammers documented in Google cached
results – attacks active as of December 31, 2021
There are also higher quality government domains which seem to be “attacked” via GoDaddy
WordPress Managed websites (and other GoDaddy managed websites) so that the domains
appear to be hosting “Canadian pharmacy” scam content. And across these higher quality
government websites attacked by this vulnerability, a common theme is that the malicious
content is almost always “injected” into PDF files/URLs – this is very odd!

43/114

Each of the results above are for PDF files, which look totally normal when you view them
directly, like via these links:

https://www.mccracken.kyschools.us/Downloads/4hexagondragons.pdf

https://www.mccracken.kyschools.us/Downloads/Pascals%20Pumpkins.pdf
https://www.mccracken.kyschools.us/Downloads/Pascals%20Penguins2.pdf
But for each of these 4 links, if you click on the “Google cached results” for these same PDF
files, a GoDaddy & Google content injection secret is revealed:

For all of the URls highlighted in red above, if you navigate to them directly, or by clicking on
the URls on the Google cached results pages, you should see “sporadic redirections” where
sometimes the first click will redirect, and then the next few will break, or the other way
around like in this example video:
So what you see here in this video and across this Kentucky public school web domain of
“.mccracken.kyschools.us”, is a very unique content injection that by all accounts is
originating from the domain “Mathwire.com” – which as you guessed it, is another GoDaddy
hosted domain:

45/114

Now, I want to make sure it’s clear these findings that keep randomly pointing to GoDaddy
are not false positives – there is no purposeful effort to only highlight domains this is
happening to which are also connected to GoDaddy – something is just very wrong with
GoDaddy right now, and it seems to have been happening for months if not years.
Across this “mathwire.com” domain, as is the case on all the GoDaddy domains “attacking
U.S. government resources” you will find significant amounts of “Canadian pharmacy”
scammer content injected into pages like in this screenshot:

46/114

47/114

But as shown previously, somehow the results for Mathwire.com are being “mapped” to the
mccracken.kyschools.us domain via Google cached search results, and showing up within
Google search results in ways to illicit clicks, which can lead to unexpected redirects into
malicious content, as shown in the first video on this page.
Specifically, the Mathwire.com domain seems to be attacking at least one other U.S.
government domain @ bce.rcs.k12.tn.us which you can see via these search results – but
there is only one “mapped file” which currently breaks during tests attempting to navigate
directly to it or via the Google search results @
http://www.bce.rcs.k12.tn.us/teachers/stemc/web_page/Games/money.pdf

Google’s cached version of the malicious content injection on bce.rcs.k12.tn.us via
Mathwire.com content is currently available and also here on the Way Back Machine. If you
click on any of the links within the cached page, you will likely be redirected to a “Canadian
pharmacy” scam website, as experienced during tests.
So one GoDaddy compromised domain is attacking 2 separate U.S. public school domains
with injected content? Odd!
———–

Other Important Government Domains Showing Malicious Google Search
Results via Injected Content from Compromised GoDaddy Domains
The FCC website has been attacked by at least 2 separate GoDaddy websites, and parts of
this speak to an operator who “turns off” an exploit to further hide their compromised
networks.
In the Google search results below, the first result shows a cached content attack from a
“NAN World” website against this FCC PDF @ https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/7021030810.pdf
which does *not* have any Google cached versions of the page – only a small remnant of
this “attack” exists in Google search results and it will disappear in a few weeks.
48/114

The second result is a spam submission PDF promoting scam websites (the FCC has a big
separate problem with this), and this is seemingly “not” related to the GoDaddy injections.
The third result links to a PDF @ https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/7021237449.pdf which indicates
it’s from a law firm “Andrew Seybold” in the document itself – yet the Google cached search
results indicate the content injection into this FCC government search result *also* comes
from the domain “AndrewseyBold.com”

49/114

50/114

And as-expected, upon checking, this “AndrewseyBold.com” is hosted on GoDaddy:

51/114

Within this malicious content mapped from a lawyers GoDaddy website into the FCC domain
(potentially via a separate CMS vulnerability in the FCC system), you will find phrases like
“SUD-003 produced systemic exposure that was 40 percent greater” within the malicious
content, which can be found on hundreds of other domains compromised by these same
scammers:

52/114

From Google search @ https://www.google.com/search?q=%22SUD003+produced+systemic+exposure+that+was+40+percent+greater%22
The “Institute of Education Services,” a U.S. government service was compromised via a
similar content injection via Google cached search results – through a domain
“educationaldatamining.org” which as you can guess – is another GoDaddy domain.

NOAA Government Website Attacked by Godaddy domain “Nefmc.org” to inject

page titles, also has the same spam content, which is taken down on their domain right now

Compromises being turned on and off?
As of this research being written, there are dozens of government domains with content
injection attacks from compromised GoDaddy domains.
The attacks seem to “turn on and off” without always being fixed by domain admins – and
high priority domains are being attacked by multiple GoDaddy compromised websites,
alluding to special targeting of higher quality domains.
Some additional domains and brief details about how they are compromised are inclkuded
below. Each of these can be “site searched” on Google to gather additional details.

Clifton, Virginia government domain is *attacking itself* and is likely compromised –

the domain “cliftonva.gov” is literally itself hosted on GoDaddy’s managed website service.
This could be one of the clearest signs that both U.S. Government domains are being
targeted, and Godaddy services are the root cause.

Several U.S. Military Domains Attacked for Months via GoDaddy

The U.S. military isn’t beyond having content injected within their .mil suffix from this same
content injection attack, with the Minnesota National Guard’s core
“minnesotanationalguard.ng.mil” domain having content injected from the GoDaddy hosted
domain of “www.sctimesapps.com” as recently as December 26, 2021.
I should note that I first reported the content injection on this domain in July 2021 to Google
and several other entities, but at that time I had no idea about the Godaddy connections, and
couldn’t figure out how the injection was happening. My submissions on this “problem” this
past Summer were not very accurate due to not fully understanding the source and scale of
the injections…. But the private details I collected many months ago on this domain, prove
it’s an ongoing problem that has never been fixed. When I reported it to them, Google
basically told me to “pound sand” (in nicer words) and that “they had it under control” which
is par for the course on certain submissions to them.

The Big Questions: How is this being done? And who needs to do
what to stop this mess?
It’s important to point out that I first noticed these injections back in July 2021, yet didn’t
connect any significant aspect of it to GoDaddy infrastructure. Since I first started noticing
these unique injections, and seeing the malicious redirects with my own eyes, and then
retesting infrastructure only to find it changed or broken, the whole process has felt like
hunting a ghost in the shell.
Through a bit of luck during efforts to reverse engineer how the malicious redirects were
being created and what exactly the risks were to end users, I was able to capture one of the
malicious redirects which was using a specific Response Header called “X-CF-RAYX”
with a dynamic payload.
This “X-CF-RAYX” Response Header is very unique. You probably won’t be familiar with it
even if you’re a network engineer, but maybe if you’re a malware analyst….That’s not good.
There is a PHP malware payload that has been found on specific servers, reported back in
July 2021 and written about in this fantastically helpful post, “Malicious PHP I found on a
colleague’s website
”

I’d strongly recommend reading the entire blog post about this PHP malware, the author
included an entire payload that I’ll also highlight here – but this author also highlighted
something unique and important – these payloads were found associated with .ru – Russian
domain suffixes, and I see no connection to GoDaddy with these early domains. It appears
that early tests were associated with Russia prior to moving into this other phase of what
could be the same PHP malware (Reminder: WordPress is written in PHP, which would be at
the heart of GoDaddy’s Managed WordPress infrastructure).

The author of the post who originally found this PHP malware also included a secondary
payload that was found on another compromised site – the heavy obfuscation of this actor
becomes even more clear:

Here is the malicious payload which references the Response Header that I saw during my
tests:

106/114

function get_proxy_page($phead=1){
$proto=stripos(@$_SERVER[‘SERVER_PROTOCOL’],’https’) === true ? ‘https://’ :
‘http://’;
$crurl=$proto.@$_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’].@$_SERVER[‘REQUEST_URI’];
list($buf,$curly_page_get_info)=curly_page_get($crurl);
$ct=@$curly_page_get_info[‘content_type’];
$nexturl=@$curly_page_get_info[‘redirect_url’];
$status=@$curly_page_get_info[‘http_code’];
if (status!=””)header(“Status: $status”);
if ($phead)header(“X-CF-RAYX: “.substr(md5(time()),0,10));
Based on my attempts to understand aspects of this infrastructure, this Response Header
seems to be one of the “most visible / consistent” ways to see the malicious redirects – at
least that’s my current opinion based on what I know.

More alarming, if you compare the PHP code from this July 2021 blog post, it aligns to
similar PHP malware from 3 years ago, which someone within the comments section flagged
– and that compromise specifically involved Godaddy hosting, which was written up in this
post, “GoDaddy shared Windows hosting compromised.”

But do you know what is *most alarming* about this blog post from 3 years ago focused on
PHP malicious orchestration injections on GoDaddy hosted servers? There are people in
the comments as recently as last month who found the blog post due to compromised
PHP files being found on their GoDaddy servers. There are numerous victims cleaning
up servers still this year, with no clarity about how it’s happening:

Some users in the comments section of that post from 3 years ago noted that their
“web.config” files were compromised, which seems to be a pretty solid way to conduct
orchestration attacks against page templates. If you aren’t familiar with this concept,
Microsoft Developer Support has a “helpful” article called “Injecting content to every page on
a site” explaining how to inject global scripts into templates within a PHP application.

There is another code sample that someone uploaded to unPHP which has nearly the same
payload highlighted in the blog post from July 2021, but in one large code chunk which
makes it slightly easier to see the sections focused on Googlebot as well as this section that
references the header “X-CF-RAYX” :

110/114

This code here makes it clear that when the malicious PHP file on a compromised server
identifies Googlebot or other crawling services, it pushes unique payloads for this session,
which seems to be how the injections are showing up in Google search results and resulting
in illicit traffic to their scam pharmacy domains:

———There is one potential, successful capture of a malicious payload being pushed through the
GoDaddy domain “wsimg.com” here on Joe’s Sandbox @
https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/228738/0/html – certain elements of this report should
be reviewed by anyone interested in attempting to reverse engineer how Googlebot is
impacted.

The ‘http://tencent.wsimg.com’ subdomain within GoDaddy’s potentially compromised
infrastructure has been identified in Google’s Virustotal malware directory associated with
recent malware campaigns @

The Tria.ge service flagged problems with certain requests that included the wsimg.com
domain here @ https://tria.ge/210511-7j62grpgw2/behavioral2

Who should do what about this problem?
Google’s Google Bot is broken – and it’s been broken for a while, just like I told them it
was. Google needs to stop thinking that there are zero ways for a domain to trick Googlebot
into caching the wrong content for the domain, because it’s clear that GoDaddy domains are
doing just that and attacking U.S. Government domains with this tactic.
GoDaddy’s wsimg.com domain is a shit show and needs a total implosion of all
services and infrastructure touching it – something remains deeply broken on this
domain, it appears to be partially controlled by malicious actors who can use it to launch and
“un-launch” attacks on specific GoDaddy clients, who then can be used to conduct attacks
against the Googlebot to “inject malicious content” into what appears to be U.S. government
domains (along with other schools, nonprofits and organizations *not* included in this
research because there are just too many attacks flowing from GoDaddy servers right now).
CISA & the U.S. government – Please for the love of God stop hosting websites with
GoDaddy’s Managed Hosting Provider, at a bare minimum until these problems are clarified.
Furthermore, a very close audit of all compromised servers in this research needs to be
undertaken, looking specifically for malicious PHP files on any servers, but also looking for
any specific CMS weaknesses that were exploited via these GoDaddy hosted websites.
Some of the domains which have active injections seemed to have relationships with the
domains who were injecting content via Googlebot, and some aspects of this seemed
unique.
Everyone using GoDaddy Managed Hosting Providers (WordPress, Drupal, any of
them) – You should consider your server potentially compromised, and check for unexpected
PHP files with unique names being hosted on your servers. There seems to be a ton of
dynamic orchestration involved, and this appears to also include the naming of the
compromised PHP files. I would also strongly urge changing passwords, which GoDaddy
also recommended in their SEC report *(and seems to have forced all their clients to do).
