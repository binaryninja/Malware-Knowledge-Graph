W32.Flamer is possibly the only Windows based threat we have encountered which uses
Bluetooth. It is yet another indicator that W32.Flamer is not only exceptional, but that it is a
comprehensive information gathering and espionage tool. The CrySyS laboratory has
previously documented the technical details of Bluetooth in W32.Flamer. But, what does
this actually mean for potential victims targeted by Flamer? What can an attacker
accomplish using Bluetooth?
The Bluetooth functionality in Flamer is encoded in a module called "BeetleJuice". This
module is triggered according to configuration values set by the attacker. When triggered it
performs two primary actions:
1. The first is to scan for all Bluetooth devices in range. When a device is found, its
status is queried and the details of the device recorded—including its ID—presumably
to be uploaded to the attacker at some point.

2. The second action is to configure itself as a Bluetooth beacon. This means that a
computer compromised by W32.Flamer will appear when any other Bluetooth device
scans the local area. And there is more. In addition to enabling a Bluetooth beacon,
Flamer encodes details about the infected computer (see Figure 1) and then stores
these details in a special 'description' field. When any other device scans for
Bluetooth-enabled devices, this description field will be displayed:
These are the facts of how Flamer uses Bluetooth. And what can the attacker do with this
functionality? There are several potential avenues available:

Scenario #1 – Identification of victim social networks

1/3

By continuously monitoring the Bluetooth devices within range of a W32.Flamer
compromised computer, the attacker can build a profile of various devices encountered
throughout the day. This will be particularly effective if the compromised computer is a
laptop because the victim is more likely to carry it around. Over time, as the victim meets
associates and friends, the attackers will catalog the various devices encountered, most
likely mobile phones. This way the attackers can build a map of interactions with various
people—and identify the victim's social and professional circles.

Scenario #2 – Identification of victim physical locations
When compromising a victim's computer, the attacker has determined that this particular
victim and their location is a high-priority target. While the building that the victim resides in
can be known, the actual office is not identified. The attacker, however, could identify the
location of compromised devices using Bluetooth.
Bluetooth operates over radio waves. By measuring the strength of a radio wave signal, an
attacker can measure if he is she is getting closer or further away to a particular device.
With the Bluetooth beacon turned on, and with the details of a particular compromised
device available in the description field, it is straightforward for the attacker to identify the
physical location of a W32.Flamer compromised computer or device.
An alternative to this is that rather than identifying the actual compromised computer, the
attacker identifies a mobile phone which belongs to the victim. The Beetlejuice module
already has retrieved a list of all the devices IDs which are near to the infected computer
and so the attacker knows what devices belong to the victim. It is likely that one of the
devices is a mobile phone which the victim carries most times. Now the attacker has the
ability to passively monitor for the victim, without installing or modifying the victim's devices.
Bluetooth monitoring devices could be placed in airports, train stations, or any transport
hub, and listen for the ID values of any known victim device. Some attacks have even
identified Bluetooth devices more than one mile away. The more sinister aspect of this
passive sniffing is that it allows the attacker to pinpoint a victim and, therefore, more easily
track them in the future.

Scenario #3 – Enhanced information gathering

As described in our previous blog, a substantial part of Flamer’s functionality is
implemented in Lua scripts, or 'apps' which are downloaded from the FLAME 'app
repository’. It would be trivial for an attacker to upload a new malicious Bluetooth Lua app

into the FLAME store for download onto a compromised device. With increase functionality
an attacker, having identified various Bluetooth devices in range, could perform numerous
attacks:
Steal contacts from an address book, steals SMS messages, steals images, and
more.
Use a device to eavesdrop. Connect a compromised computer to a nearby device and
enable handsfree communication. When the device is brought into a meeting room, or
used to make a call, the attackers could listen in.
Exfiltrate already-stolen data through any nearby device's data connection. This would
bypass any firewalls or network controls. An attacker within one mile of the target
could use their own Bluetooth-enabled device for this.
It is possible that there is undiscovered code within W32.Flamer which already achieves
some of these goals. For example, although we have not found network code near the
'beacon' code, one compromised computer may connect to another computer using
Bluetooth. If the second computer is using a secured network and was infected through a
USB connection, potentially the only network available would be a Bluetooth connection
back to the first compromised computer. The code to achieve this may already exist in
Flame.
The various theories described here are all practical attacks, easily to implement by a
skilled attacker. The sophistication of W32.Flamer indicates that the attackers are certainly
technically skilled and such attacks are well within their capabilities.
