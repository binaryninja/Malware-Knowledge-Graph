Very few security products and services give enough consideration to the reputation and
quality of the Name Server associated with domains they are looking at. We pick here a
High Value Suspicious Domain and check what else is on the same name server to
examine what is discovered through the process.
Our seeding domain will be service-update[.]link
Looking at the Name Server info from our API
"domain": "service-update[.]link",
"ns_avg_ttl": 4149,
"ns_domain": "dendrite.network",
1/4

"num_domains": 203,
This is a low density Name server where we have only seen 203 domains on it. It has a
very low average TTL across all the domains on there which may suggest a lot of changes
compared to other name servers.
A quick lookup using our explore API gives us a number of suspicious domains with
matching characteristics. These appear to be in two groups.
Group 1.
Commonalities- Tech related theme. Nameserver domain- dendrite.network. Have an A
record-AS holder ColoCrossing- Registrar Namesilo- "address": "Tavernier St., Wall House",
"city": "Loubiere",
"country": "DM",
Domain PTR Record Potential Target Registrar
update-support[.]network *colocrossing.com 3 Mobile UK Namesilo
service-update[.]link *colocrossing.com Live soon Namesilo
hs-securealerts[.]com *colocrossing.com HSBC Namesilo
ref0948a[.]com *colocrossing.com unknown Namesilo
uk-taxupdate[.]com *colocrossing.com HMRC Namesilo
aem-new[.]com *colocrossing.com 3 Mobile UK Namesilo
aempath[.]com *colocrossing.com 3 Mobile UK Namesilo
com-gb[.]mobi *colocrossing.com Mobile UK Namesilo
It appears that Group 1 have either been used maliciously already or are waiting to be used
maliciously. Monitoring the “waiting” group for changes is key as this may lead to being able
to block their activity once the domain moves into an actively malicious mode. There are a
number of ways to do this such as monitoring for new changes in DNS or associated
records. Moving of infrastructure can often mark an activation of a malicious domain. A
good example of this is when the domain avsvmcloud[.]com was activated for the
Solarwinds breach, it switched to its own nameservers for the active part of the campaign.

Group 2.
This group seems to lead to more and more indicators so I’ll post them over time.
2/4

Commonalities- Tech related theme. Nameserver domain- dendrite.network. Domains have
been aged. Have an A record-AS holder Nice IT Services Group Inc.

So just touching on these two groups based on similarities, these of course could be one
group, this Nameserver is very heavily used by malicious actors and definitely one threat
actor group called Team TNT.
How can I use this information?
All the information above was collected by our API and can be leveraged for threat hunting
or detections. The information is pre-collected and cached so new lookups don’t have to be
done each time you have a new indicator to check. We’ve already collected all this
information and run some analysis on it to give things like reputation scores for the
nameserver, the AS number reputation, the subnet reputation etc.
A security team can use Yara rules over this information to try and find “High Value
Malicious Domains “ in their logs or associated IP addresses.
3/4

We also have threat hunting API endpoints that gather behavioral clusters for you so you
can quickly create your own new intelligence, or we can do it for you.
