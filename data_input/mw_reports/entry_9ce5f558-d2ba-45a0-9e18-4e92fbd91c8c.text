A destructive data wiper was discovered recently by the ESET researchers that were used in
attacks against Ukrainian organizations. It is the third strain of wiper malware that was
discovered since the Russian invasion started to affect computers in Ukraine.
ESET researchers named this malware, CaddyWiper, and as soon as a compromised
system is infected by this malware, it erases all the data and partition information.
ESET products detect this malware as Win32/KillDisk[.]NCX and there have been multiple
reports of the wiper being installed on systems in a limited number of organizations.
While apart from this, neither HermeticWiper nor IsaacWiper (Two other strains of wiper
malware targeting computers in Ukraine) shares any close code similarities with
CaddyWiper. The CaddyWiper malware may have been launched after the threat actors
hacked into the target network.

However, till now it has been detected that only one organization has been targeted by the
CaddyWiper, in short, the number of cases in the wild is small.

In the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, ESET’s telemetry discovered HermeticWiper on
the networks of several high-profile organizations in Ukraine.
Furthermore, HermeticWiper was propagated inside local networks with HermeticWizard, as
well as HermeticRansom, which served as decoy ransomware.
Here the malware is primarily designed with the sole intention of attacking the target rather
than extracting any financial data, information, and reward from the victim.
In January of this year, a similar data wiper called WhisperGate struck multiple organizations
in Ukraine. In the last eight years, high-profile targets in the country have been targeted in a
series of malicious campaigns like this.
In this ongoing cyberwarfare, some of the hackers supporting Ukraine have used malware
against pro-Russian cybercriminals, who use malware to degrade and destroy data on
Ukrainian computer systems.
While on the other hand, other hackers have targeted Russian companies and government
agencies to leak their confidential information. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far not
resulted in a large-scale cyberattack, but larger attacks could still occur.
