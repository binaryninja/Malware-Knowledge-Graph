Bitdefender Labs on the Case
When GandCrab started spiking on the threat map in January 2018, Bitdefender released
the first free decryptor to help victims take their digital lives back. More than 2,000 home
users, companies and non-profits used it to retrieve their lost data and avoid paying millions
in ransom.
Ten months later, we released another decryptor to expand support to GandCrab versions 1,
4 and 5 up to 5.0.3. Ever since, we been contacted by and keeping in touch with thousands
of victims seeking help.
While this is the third time we have defeated GandCrab encryption in the past year, our
celebration will be short-lived. We’ll be back to work tomorrow, as GandCrab operators will
no doubt change tactics and techniques.
GandCrab in Numbers
GandCrab has inflicted hundreds of millions of dollars in losses globally since its emergence,
and is now one of the most prevalent families of ransomware on the market. Since our first
decryptor, in aggregate we have already helped nearly 10,000 victims save more than $5

million dollars in decryption fees nearly 20,000 victims save a minimum of $18 million US
dollars by the end of February: .

GandCrab on the Attack
Last year, some GandCrab affiliates began attacking organizations via exposed Remote
Desktop Protocol instances, or by directly logging in with stolen domain credentials. After
authenticating on a compromised PC, attackers manually run the ransomware and instruct it
to spread across the entire network. Once the network is infected, the attackers wipe their
traces clean and contact the victim with a decryption offer.
Recently, GandCrab operators have also started delivering ransomware to companies via
vulnerabilities in remote IT support software used by managed service providers to manage
customer workstations. To learn more about what MSPs need to do in order to stay safe
from ransomware, watch our webinar:

This persistence is why prevention is crucial. If you have a security solution, make sure it is
up-to-date and has layered defenses against ransomware. The better it is at detection, the
lower your chances of infection. Also make sure you are running the latest version of your
OS and third-party software.
If you don’t have a security solution, get one now. It helps a lot, and it’s way less expensive
than a $600 ransom payment.
Last but not least, stop whatever you are doing and make and verify an external backup of
your important data. Should disaster strike, you will have a copy to restore from.
Otherwise, Bitdefender and partner law enforcement agencies advise victims to reject the
demands of ransomware operators. Instead, back up the encrypted information and notify
the police immediately. And follow us here for updates.
