BazarLoader Adds Compromised Installers, ISO to
Arrival and Delivery Vectors

As the installers load, it drops and executes a BazarLoader executable. This is also one of
the notable differences from recent BazarLoader arrival mechanisms wherein the malicious
actors appeared to favor dynamic link libraries (DLL).

BazarLoader executable
Using Trend Micro Vision One, we tracked the installer creating a process, “vlc-3.0.16win3..2.tmp,” after executing ste.exe, which copies the latter executable to the disk and
executes it. It then connects with the command and control (C&C) server and injects a copy
of itself into a new suspended MS Edge process.

Arrival via ISO file
Meanwhile, we also found a delivery mechanism abusing ISO files, wherein DLL and LNK
files contained inside execute the BazarLoader DLL in it. The LNK file uses a folder icon to
deceive the user into double clicking the icon, enabling the file to run the enclosed
BazarLoader DLL file.

It then calls the export function “EnterDLL,” a function that BazarLoader has used recently.
Rundll32.exe loads the malicious DLL and communicates with the C&C server, then
proceeds to spawn a suspended MS Edge process to inject itself into it.

Conclusion
The number of arrival mechanism variations used in BazarLoader campaigns continue to
increase as threat actors diversify their attack patterns to evade detection. However, both
techniques are noteworthy and still work despite their lack of novelty due to singular
detection technologies’ limitations. For instance, while the use of compromised installers has
been observed with other malware, the large file size can still challenge detection solutions
— such as sandboxes — which may implement file size limits. On the other hand, LNK files
serving as shortcuts will also likely be obfuscated for the additional layers created between
the shortcut and the malicious files itself.
In addition, the deployment of BazarLoader malware for initial access is a known technique
for modern ransomware such as Conti and Ryuk as service affiliates. Aside from these
known ransomware families including more tools for entry into their arsenal, other malware
groups and ransomware operators may pick up on the additional means, if they have not
already done so.
Best practices
4/6

BazarLoader is an example of a versatile malware delivery mechanism that will likely find
more ways to adapt to deceive more users. For details on all the other measures that
BazarLoader uses to get into systems, read our technical brief here.
Here are some best practices to defend against this threat:
Enable security solutions that allow for visibility in tracking processes of files, allowing
security teams to detect malicious outgoing and incoming network communication and
traffic.
Download installers and updates only from their respective official websites and
platforms.
Trend Micro solutions
BazarLoader will continue to evolve as an information stealer malware on its own, an initial
access malware-as-a-service (MaaS) for other malware operators, and as an enabler for
secondary payload delivery for even more disruptive attacks like modern ransomware.
Security teams must make monitoring and tracking for known threats more visible based on
known data and use multilayered solutions capable of pattern recognition and behavior
monitoring for unknown threats.
Trend Micro Vision One™ helps detect and block suspicious activity, even those that might
seem insignificant when monitored from only a single layer, through multilayered protection
and behavior detection. It helps spot and block BazarLoader and its other components
wherever it might be on the system. Trend Micro Apex One™ employs behavior analysis to
protect systems against malicious scripts, injection, ransomware, and memory and browser
attacks related to fileless threats from initial access, execution, and C&C communication.
Trend Micro Worry-Free™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from
BazarLoader by detecting malicious files and spammed messages, JavaScript droppers, and
DLL loaders, as well as URLs associated with the threat.
Trend Micro Email Security delivers continuously updated protection to stop spam, malware,
spear phishing, ransomware, and advanced targeted attacks before they reach the network.
It protects Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office 365, Google Apps, and other hosted and onpremises email solutions. Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ provides detection, in-depth
analysis, and proactive response to ransomware attacks through specialized engines,
custom sandboxing, and seamless correlation across the entire attack life cycle such as tool
ingress, exploits, C&C activities, and lateral movements. Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™
Email Inspector and InterScan™ Web Security perform custom sandboxing and advanced
analysis techniques to prevent malware from ever reaching end users, especially potentially
vulnerable users working remotely. These effectively deter potential ransomware attacks that
are delivered through malicious emails.

Cloud-specific security solutions such as Trend Micro™ Hybrid Cloud Security can help
protect cloud-native systems and their various layers. Trend Micro Cloud One™ protects
cloud-native systems by securing continuous-integration and continuous-delivery (CI/CD)
pipelines and applications. It also helps identify and resolve security issues sooner and
improves delivery time for DevOps teams.
