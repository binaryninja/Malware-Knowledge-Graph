Overview.
Attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their phishing techniques, and brand
impersonation attempts are looking more and more genuine. Recently, Perception Point’s
platform intercepted a dangerous phishing campaign that would easily fool many users, as it
looks quite authentic.
In this post, we will present the attack and how Perception Point’s engines prevented it.
In this attack, we see legitimate-looking emails, spoofing the target company using name
only or full address, using a legitimate-looking payload in the form of an HTML attachment
(the term payload, in this context, refers to any attack containing a file or a URL).

1/4

The HTML attachment embodies a well-made login page, spoofing the real brand login page,
and once you type in your password, you’re redirected to the actual phished brand’s URL,
and simultaneously your credentials are sent to the attacker.

The Mail.
In this phishing attack, the attacker tries to impersonate the targeted brand using the
following assets in the email:
Brand logo
Brand signature
Brand email body design
Using the brand’s color pallet and language
To add credibility, the attacker takes advantage of typical messages that are sent by the
brand and mimics those messages.
In the following examples, you can see the attacker’s original emails, where he uses the
brand’s language and typical messages that the receiver would expect, based on past
interaction with known websites such as CMA CGM, Coinbase, and Indeed:

The Payload.
To complete the disguise, the attacker uses an HTML file containing a well-faked brand login
page which upon credential submission actually redirects you to the real brand login page,
making it look like it really belongs to the brand – all the while sending the submitted
credentials to the attacker.
The sign-in page completely spoofs the real brands. Here are our 3 examples from CMA
CGM, Coinbase, and Indeed:

The credentials are sent to a different WordPress domain which was hacked by the same
attacker or bought by him (we saw in another article how attackers use compromised
WordPress sites to host phishing)
How did we prevent this attack?
Perception Point’s email threat protection prevents advanced anti-phishing algorithms. The
system leverages image-recognition algorithms for the purpose of identifying brand
impersonation sites, as well as machine learning and other technologies to detect spoofing of
names, domains, and brands, to prevent any attack – even if highly disguised.
Perception Point takes an active (“dynamic”) approach, rendering the HTML page on several
browsers, to ensure “zero-day” phishing attacks are intercepted well before reaching the
end-user’s email box as opposed to other solutions that only use reputation and static
engines.

Recommendations.
Awareness and education of users could have helped to prevent this attack. It is important to
educate users on the fact that an HTML attachment would never be sent by a legitimate
business, and they should never submit any personal information through such attachment.
Also, rather than clicking a link through an email to submit any requested information, it is
good best practice for users to actively surf to the website, in order to complete any
transaction that they were requested to complete in the email. And the final recommendation
is of course to use an advanced security solution with dynamic analysis, to catch these kinds
of attacks and others that have managed to evade users for any kind of reason.
