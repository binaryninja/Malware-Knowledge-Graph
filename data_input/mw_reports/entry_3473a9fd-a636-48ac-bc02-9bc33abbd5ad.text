iv ABOUT THIS REPORT

About this report
The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) focuses on software
vulnerabilities, software vulnerability exploits, malware, and unwanted software.
Past reports and related resources are available for download at
www.microsoft.com/sir. We hope that readers find the data, insights, and
guidance provided in this report useful in helping them protect their
organizations, software, and users.
Reporting period
This volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report focuses on the first and
second quarters of 2015, with trend data for the last several quarters presented
on a quarterly basis. Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent
from quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of
the year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly
basis.
Throughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced
using the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n
indicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H15 represents the first half of 2015
(January 1 through June 30), and 4Q14 represents the fourth quarter of 2014
(October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting
period or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report.
Conventions
This report uses the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming
standard for families and variants of malware. For information about this
standard, see “Appendix A: Threat naming conventions” on page 123. In this
report, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique base name is
considered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration includes
threats that may not otherwise be considered families according to common
industry practices, such as generic detections. For the purposes of this report, a
threat is defined as a malware or unwanted software family or variant that is
detected by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 v

Foreword
Welcome to Volume 19 of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR). I’ve
contributed to the SIR for almost ten years now. If I had to describe how the
threat landscape has changed during that time using only one word, I’d say it’s
“cumulative.”
Ten years ago we reported on a range of threats that included trojans, worms,
trojan downloaders & droppers, exploits, bots (backdoor trojans), among
others. These types of threats were primarily motivated by a desire to disrupt
networks, as worms did years earlier, or to seek profit.
Fast forward ten years and we still see the same categories of threats and even
some of the same threat families employed. During this time, attackers have had
to evolve their tactics to get malware onto computers that have also been
evolving with continuously elevating security levels. As vulnerabilities in
operating systems have become harder to find and exploit, attackers have relied
increasingly on social engineering to compromise computer systems.
In addition to these types of attacks, we have seen more threat actors with
different motivations emerge over the years, including hacktivists and
practitioners of military and economic espionage. Rogue security software or
fake antivirus software that was used to trick people into installing malware and
disclosing credit card information to attackers has been replaced by
ransomware that seeks to extort victims by encrypting their data. Commercial
exploit kits now dominate the list of top exploits we see trying to compromise
unpatched computers, which means the exploits that computers are exposed to
on the Internet are professionally managed and constantly optimized at an
increasingly quick rate. Targeted attacks have become common as opposed to
the exception.
Attackers continue to try to use the tactics that they did years ago, and have
added to their repertoire of dirty tricks. This is why I use the word “cumulative” to
describe how things have changed. If I could use a second word to describe how
they have changed I would use “accelerated.” The focus and pace that some
attackers have been demonstrating recently have certainly increased over time.

vi FOREWORD

Notice I didn’t use the word “advanced.” Although attackers have accumulated
more tricks and tactics and seem to be using them in a more focused, fastpaced way, they still focus on a relatively small number of ways to compromise
computers, including:


Unpatched vulnerabilities



Misconfigured computers



Weak passwords



Social engineering

The great news if you are a CISO or security professional is that you’ve never
had so much information and so many security capabilities and tools as you do
today to defend your organization’s data.
Please enjoy the report.

FOREWORD

STRONTIUM: A profile of a
persistent and motivated
adversary
A research team at the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC)
proactively monitors the threat landscape for emerging threats. Part of this job
involves keeping tabs on targeted attack groups, which are often the first ones
to introduce new exploits and techniques that are later used widely by other
attackers. One such group, which Microsoft has code-named STRONTIUM, is of
particular interest because of its aggressive, persistent tactics and techniques,
and its repeated use of new zero-day exploits to attack its targets. Microsoft is
sharing some of the information it has gathered on this prominent attack group
in the hope that it will raise awareness of the group’s activities and help
organizations take immediate advantage of available mitigations that can
significantly reduce the risks that they face from this and similar groups.
Adversary profile
STRONTIUM has been active since at least 2007. Whereas most modern
untargeted malware is ultimately profit-oriented, STRONTIUM mainly seeks
sensitive information. Its primary institutional targets have included government
bodies, diplomatic institutions, and military forces and installations in NATO
member states and certain Eastern European countries. Additional targets have
included journalists, political advisors, and organizations associated with political
activism in central Asia. STRONTIUM is Microsoft’s code name for this group,
following its internal practice of assigning chemical element names to activity
groups; other researchers have used code names such as APT28,1 Sednit,2
Sofacy,3 and Fancy Bear as labels for a group or groups that have displayed

activity similar to the activity observed from STRONTIUM. The group’s persistent
use of spear phishing tactics and access to previously undiscovered zero-day
exploits have made it a highly resilient threat.
How STRONTIUM attacks a target
STRONTIUM primarily uses two kinds of attack. It uses spear phishing—phishing
attempts targeted at specific individuals—to perform reconnaissance and steal
login credentials to gather information about potential highvalue targets associated with the institution under attack.
Whereas most Following the reconnaissance phase, it uses a variety of
modern methods to infect the computers of high-value targets with
untargeted malware, often by exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities
in browser add-ons and other software.

STRONTIUM
mainly seeks
sensitive
information.

Reconnaissance and target identification

STRONTIUM typically begins its attack on an institution by
identifying and profiling potential victims with connections to
the institution. Microsoft has seen indications that STRONTIUM
relies on open-source intelligence (OSINT), such as email lists
and information harvested from public forums or social
networking sites, to identify targets for spear phishing. Microsoft
also believes that STRONTIUM relies on past successful phishing
attacks to augment its dataset, by making use of any email
communications it can identify between prior targets and the current target.
STRONTIUM casts a wide net with its reconnaissance activities, seeking login
credentials for email and other systems from a large number of people, which it
then weeds through to assess its value. Microsoft believes STRONTIUM used its
spear phishing attacks to target several thousand individuals during the first half
of 2015. Although STRONTIUM isn’t choosy with its targets, it is persistent. When
STRONTIUM identifies an individual to target, the group will repeatedly conduct
spear phishing attacks against it over a long duration, possibly a year or more,
until one of the attempts succeeds.
STRONTIUM’s spear phishing modus operandi focuses on making the recipient
concerned about unauthorized use of an account. A recent attack campaign
involved sending messages with the subject line “Privacy alert” purporting to
originate from a well-known email service, informing the user that their account

has been accessed from an unrecognized device in a different country. Because
the targeted individuals are often professionals who have access to sensitive
information, this can be an effective way to entice users to click a “change
password” link that actually leads to a webpage under the attacker’s control.
Figure 1. An example of a credential-stealing spear phishing message sent by STRONTIUM

Typically, the link will lead to a domain name that is similar to a legitimate
domain name used by the service in an effort to fool the user into thinking the
message is legitimate. Figure 2 lists some examples.

If the attack is successful, STRONTIUM uses the captured credentials to access
the victim’s email account to identify additional targets and for additional
analysis and attacks. Even if the recipient doesn’t enter their login credentials
MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 5

into the malicious webpage, the act of clicking the link can provide STRONTIUM
with valuable information. In addition to providing STRONTIUM with the
recipient’s IP address, clicking the link transmits a user-agent string to the web
server that typically includes details about the recipient’s browser and operating
system versions, and sometimes includes information about the browser addons the recipient is using. This can provide STRONTIUM with insight into what
software is deployed in the organization, and possibly help it plan future driveby download activities.

Attacking the target
The ultimate goal of the reconnaissance phase is to compile a list of high-value
individuals who have information or access that STRONTIUM wants. With this list
at hand, the group moves to the next phase of operations: installing malware on

the high-value targets’ computers, and thereby gaining access to the
institution’s network.
STRONTIUM primarily uses email to deliver malware to targeted individuals,
although some researchers have reported delivery through social networking
channels as well. Typical messages, such as the one shown in Figure 4, are tied
to current events: an upcoming conference, for example, or a real world news
event in which the recipient might be interested. STRONTIUM’s email senders
are usually associated with well-known email providers, and use plausibleseeming names and titles that are designed to give the messages credibility.
Depending on the specific attack used, the message typically includes a link for
“additional information,” which will launch a drive-by download or social
engineering attack when clicked. Other messages include malicious attachments
instead of links, typically a document file containing an exploit.

Little is known about how and what information STRONTIUM gathers to tailor its
attacks to specific high-value individuals. As discussed earlier, the user-agent
and potential fingerprinting information gathered from phishing victims may
play a part in planning the individual attacks by giving the group insight into
what software may be in widespread use within the institution. In general,

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 7

STRONTIUM can take advantage of a variety of attacks that span general tactics
and cover a wide range of technologies, including zero-day exploits.
Zero-day exploits—exploits that target vulnerabilities for which the affected
software vendor has not yet released a security update—form a significant part
of STRONTIUM’s arsenal. It is not yet clear whether the group researches
vulnerabilities and develops the exploits themselves, or purchases them on the
black market.
Microsoft researchers have observed STRONTIUM moving swiftly to take
advantage of newly disclosed vulnerabilities; notably, the group
Zero-day exploits deployed a number of zero-day exploits disclosed in a July 2015
leak of information from the security company Hacking Team. In

arsenal.

The exploits used by STRONTIUM include a wide range of
products from multiple vendors, including Adobe Flash Player, the Oracle Java
Runtime Environment (JRE), Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer, and some
components of the Windows kernel. Figure 5 lists some of the exploits used by
STRONTIUM in recent campaigns, including a number of zero-day exploits
(shaded). All of the vulnerabilities listed in Figure 5 were quickly addressed by
security updates as part of the vendors’ rapid response processes. (See
“Guidance” on page 16 for information about how organizations can use up-todate software to defend against targeted attacks.)

STRONTIUM: A PROFILE OF A PERSISTENT AND MOTIVATED ADVERSARY

In addition to using zero-day exploits, STRONTIUM also makes use of exploits
that target older vulnerabilities for which security updates have been available
for a long time. Microsoft believes that in some cases, the group learns during
the reconnaissance phase that the targeted institution may be exposed to risks
by running older or out-of-support platforms and software, by not testing and
applying security updates quickly, or by not taking advantage of the latest
mitigations and defense mechanisms shipped with more recent product
versions—and then acts accordingly.
In a development observed in October 2015, the shellcode that executes after a
successful memory corruption exploit displayed a number of characteristics that
researchers had not observed from the malware previously:


API resolution: ROR 0x0D hashing, resolution made just before using the API



Downloader: usage of HttpQueryInfo and WININET to fetch remote
payloads in memory



Compression: usage of ntdll!RtlDecompressBuffer()LZNT1 compression for
remote payloads



Privilege escalation: executed as DLL, but in-memory (diskless)

Figure 6. In-memory decompression and execution of remote payloads performed by STRONTIUM shellcode

In addition to relying on exploits, STRONTIUM also uses social engineering to
trick victims into installing malware. Since March of 2015, for example, Microsoft
has observed STRONTIUM successfully compromising Mozilla Firefox users by
convincing them to install a malicious browser add-on based on a publicly
available module (“Bootstrapped Addon Social Engineering Code Execution”)
developed for the Metasploit security testing framework.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 9

Figure 7. STRONTIUM installs malware via a malicious bootstrapped add-on in Mozilla Firefox

Establishing control
After gaining administrative privileges on the computer through an exploit or
social engineering, STRONTIUM uses a dropper to deploy a backdoor
component, CORESHELL, which eventually downloads other modules.
(Microsoft products sometimes detect the primary components as variants in
the Win32/Foosace family, although the group has used other malware in the
past.) The DLL backdoor is installed via execution of rundll32 with an export
named “init” or “InitW.” The dropper deletes itself after execution, while the DLL
backdoor and any additional components are typically copied under the
following folders:


C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSInfo\



C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Local\Microsoft Help\



C:\ProgramData\

The dropper also writes the command and control (C&C) configuration
information to the registry or an encrypted file. This strategy complicates
forensic discovery of the attacker’s infrastructure if the backdoor DLL is
discovered, because the configuration information must be located separately.

STRONTIUM ensures that its backdoor will run every time the computer starts by
creating autostart extensibility point (ASEP) registry entries and shortcuts, which
differ depending on what the attacker has chosen for the victim and which
backdoor variant is used. (See “Advanced Malware Cleaning Techniques for the
IT Professional” on page 96 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 11
(January–June 2011), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for
guidance on using Sysinternals tools to monitor ASEPs for signs of malware
infection.) The most common ASEPs used by STRONTIUM for its malware
include the following:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\



HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Explorer\Shell Folders\

The STRONTIUM backdoor is composed of several pieces with different
functions. The attacker can deploy a large set of tools to perform tasks including
key logging, email address and file harvesting, information gathering about the
local computer, and remote communication with C&C servers. STRONTIUM also
uses a component that is designed to infect connected USB storage devices, so
that information can be captured from air-gapped computers that are not on

STRONTIUM in general—that they have capabilities that cover a
wide range of technologies—and any incident response against this adversary
should take both Windows and non-Windows computers into consideration.

Taking action
The STRONTIUM backdoor can communicate over different network protocols,
including HTTP, SMTP, and POP3. Typically, the backdoor tests its connectivity
with a series of HTTP POST requests to legitimate websites, and then establishes
communication with its C&C servers. The domains
STRONTIUM uses for its C&C servers are typically designed

attention.
In recent incidents during 2015, Microsoft observed
STRONTIUM using a tunnel component designed to provide
a remote encrypted interactive shell to a pre-configured IP address using proxy
software on the victim’s computer, such as the popular open-source Squid
proxy. The tunneling module, which is customized for different targets, is slightly
larger than 1 MB and is statically linked with an OpenSSL library. Based on debug
information left in some samples, some researchers have reported that the
name of the component may be “XAPS OBJECTIVE” or “XTUNNEL.”4 The C&C
server for this tunnel could be either hardcoded in the binary or passed as a
command-line parameter at startup.

After gaining a foothold on one computer, STRONTIUM attempts to move
laterally through the organization by compromising additional computers to
gain access to more data and high-value targets. STRONTIUM uses publicly
available tools such as WinExe (a remote command-line execution tool) and
Mimikatz (a Windows credential gathering tool) to move between computers via
methods such as Pass the Hash (PtH). In recent incidents Microsoft observed
STRONTIUM using a customized version of Mimikatz that was recompiled with a
privilege escalation exploit (CVE-2015-1701, addressed by Security Bulletin
MS15-051) and stored captured credential information in a dedicated file, pi.log.
Figure 12. A customized version of Mimikatz storing passwords in the file pi.log

STRONTIUM has displayed an advanced understanding of military and classified
government networks, and uses a component that is designed to extract
information from air-gapped computers. This module registers a device callback

via RegisterDeviceNotification5 and receives a notification every time a USB
mass storage device is inserted into a compromised computer. Depending on
the variant deployed, the backdoor may simply harvest the entire contents of
the USB device and save it on the local computer for later extraction, or it may
also use Autorun malware to transfer itself to the device so that it can attempt to
compromise any other computers it is later inserted into, including air-gapped
computers.6

Some STRONTIUM victims have reported the presence of computers running
Kali Linux on their networks. Kali Linux is a Linux distribution that combines a
variety of tools for the purpose of penetration testing and security assessment. It
contains tools for password attacks, sniffing & spoofing, maintaining access,
hardware hacking, reverse engineering, information gathering, vulnerability
analysis, wireless attacks, web application attacks, stress testing, and forensic and

about this function.
6 Changes to the way the AutoRun feature works make it more difficult for this technique to succeed in recent
versions of Windows. See blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2011/06/27/defending-against-autorunattacks.aspx for more information.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 15

exploitation analysis. The tool lists within each category are quite extensive and
the distribution is actively maintained, so that STRONTIUM can always take
advantage of the latest open-source tools. STRONTIUM does not deploy this
Linux distribution on an existing computer that belongs to the targeted
institution; rather, it uses a VPN connection to join one of its own Kali Linux
computers to the victim’s network, possibly using the tunnel component that
was previously deployed. This approach allows STRONTIUM to only ephemerally
expose its toolset to the victim’s network.
Guidance
STRONTIUM is a very challenging adversary for a targeted institution to defend
against: it possesses a broad range of technical exploitation capabilities,
significant access to resources such as previously undiscovered zero-day
exploits, and the determination to keep up an attack for months or years until it
succeeds. Nevertheless, there are steps an organization can take to significantly
reduce its attack surface and decrease the probability of a successful
compromise.

STRONTIUM is a
challenging
adversary for a
targeted institution
to defend against.


Stay up-to-date on vendor security updates and deploy
them quickly after they are released. All of the exploits discussed
in this section have been addressed by security updates from
Microsoft and other vendors. STRONTIUM depends heavily on
the presence of out-of-date software installations inside target
institutions, so keeping software up-to-date denies the group
the use of some of its most effective tools.

Take advantage of the mitigations built into your software. Recent versions
of Windows and other software include critical mitigations that render many
of STRONTIUM’s exploits ineffective when deployed. Figure 5 on page 8 lists
a number of zero-day exploits that STRONTIUM has used in recent
campaigns. Most of these exploits will fail if tried on a computer running the
latest versions of Windows and Office, even without security updates that
address the vulnerabilities:

Windows 8.1 security update in November 2014. Control Flow Guard
mitigates virtual function hijacking attempts such as the one involving
the cancel() method shown in Figure 15.

and newer platforms running on hardware that supports Supervisor
Mode Execution Protection (SMEP) and other kernel mitigations.7 In fact,
the exploit is coded to abort execution if running on an operating
system other than Windows 7.



Enforce segregation of privileges on user accounts and apply all possible
safety measures to protect Admin accounts from being compromised;
STRONTIUM relies on pass-the-hash techniques and elevation of privileges
to successfully move laterally across networks. See “Mitigating Pass-theHash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft, Version 2,” available at the
Microsoft Download Center, for more information.



In enterprise environments in which isolated computer networks (airgapped) and Internet connected networks co-exist, enforce strong policies
to prevent sharing and usage of removable media across the air gap.



Conduct enterprise software security awareness training, and build
awareness about malware infection prevention. STRONTIUM heavily relies
on social engineering to entice individual targets into clicking links to
malware. Security training can raise awareness around this attack vector.



Institute multi-factor authentication. As STRONTIUM extensively uses
credential-stealing spear phishing attacks, multi-factor authentication can
be an effective tool to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are
stolen.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 19



Prepare your network to be forensically ready, so that you can achieve
containment and recovery if a compromise occurs. A forensically ready
network that records authentications, password changes, and other
significant network events can help to quickly identify affected systems.



Keep personnel and personal data private. STRONTIUM uses open-source
intelligence (OSINT) to obtain its initial lists of victims, which might include
things like name and email address, but can expand into employment
information and other items of interest. These are all pieces of information
STRONTIUM can use to devise a realistic attack. The more information
STRONTIUM has available, the better they can target you. Make sure your
email is kept confidential and privacy settings on social media don’t disclose
sensitive information publicly.

Focus on Brazil:

Win32/Banload and Banking
Malware
Online banking is big business in Brazil, where more than half
of all banking transactions have been made using Internetconnected devices in recent years.8 Unfortunately, the
popularity of online banking in Brazil has drawn the attention
of criminals, who have made the country a world capital for
banking malware for the last several years.
Win32/Banload, the most commonly encountered malware family in Brazil in
2Q15, is a generic detection for threats that download malware designed to
steal banking credentials, which themselves are usually identified as other
threats. (Encounter rates for these related threats are generally much lower than
for Banload, in part because Microsoft real-time security products block Banload
variants before they can download additional malware; therefore, examining
Banload encounter rates is a useful proxy for understanding
the banking malware problem in general.) Together, Banload

Although some variants have been found to target banks
elsewhere, Banload remains an almost exclusively Brazilian
threat. More than 93 percent of Banload encounters in 2Q15
occurred in Brazil, and the encounter rate for Banload in
Brazil was 2.1 percent in 2Q15, compared to 0.16 percent in Portugal, the
location with the second highest Banload encounter rate. While Banload was the

Banload has consistently been encountered at much higher rates in Brazil than
in the rest of the world. Over the past six quarters the encounter rate for
Banload in Brazil has fluctuated between 1.0 percent and 2.1 percent, while the
worldwide Banload encounter rate has ranged between 0.06 percent and 0.11
percent. Despite a generally rising trend that accelerated in 2Q15, the
fluctuations shown in Figure 18 are fairly typical for Banload and do not
necessarily presage significantly increased encounter rates in the future.

Propagation and technical details
Threats detected as Banload are created and distributed by many different
parties, who may have little or no connection to each other. Most variants
operate in similar ways. Banload might be installed by other malware, or use
social engineering to trick the user into launching it. After it is installed, it
contacts a remote host and downloads additional files, which then attempt to
steal banking credentials and transmit them back to the attacker. Banload
variants have been observed to connect to many different

sites that have been compromised. As with many other
variants attempt to

on the computer.
Some Banload variants check the configured system
language upon installation and only download additional
files if it is set to Portuguese. Although Banload usually does not attempt to steal
banking credentials itself, many variants transmit other details about the
computer environment to the attacker, such as the computer name, user name,
and Windows version.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 23

Many Banload variants attempt to disable security products installed on the
computer, including G-Buster Browser Defense, a browser add-on that many
large Brazilian banks provide to their customers to protect banking sessions
from malware. Some variants modify the registry so that Banload will
automatically launch each time the computer is started.
Win32/Banker and credential stealers
The malware threats downloaded by Banload variants are often detected as
Win32/Banker and Win32/Bancos. Banker and Bancos are generic detections for
data-stealing trojans that capture online banking credentials, such as account
names and passwords, and relay the captured information to a remote attacker.
As with Banload, these threats are created by many different people who often
have no connection to each other apart from their common purpose of stealing
banking credentials. Banker and Bancos variants typically monitor browser
activity for banking sessions involving large and well-known Brazilian banks,
including:


Banco Bradesco (bradesco.com.br)



Banco do Brasil (bb.com.br)



Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (banrisul.com.br)



Banco Itaú (itau.com.br)



Banco Safra (safra.com.br)



Banco Santander (santander.com.br)



Caixa Econômica Federal (caixa.gov.br)



Citibank (citibank.com.br)



HSBC (hsbc.com.br)

As with Banload, many Banker and Bancos variants attempt to disable security
products installed on the computer, including G-Buster Browser Defense, and
modify the registry so the malware will automatically launch each time the
computer is started.
Win32/BrobanDel and boleto malware
Another type of banking malware that has affected Brazil recently targets
boletos bancários, a popular payment method there. A boleto bancário, usually
simply called a boleto, is a payment order generated by a merchant or other
24 WIN32/BANLOAD AND BANKING MALWARE

payee, similar to an invoice. Boletos are popular in Brazil because they provide a
mechanism for people to pay bills or other debts without having a bank
account; they can be paid in cash at a wide range of locations, including banks,
post offices, and supermarkets. In recent years, online boletos have become
popular: payers receive them over the Internet and can either pay them
electronically from a bank account or can print them out for payment like
conventional paper boletos. It is these online boletos that have been targeted
by a new type of banking malware.
Figure 19. An example of a boleto bancário, a popular method of payment in Brazil

Every boleto has a unique identification number that specifies the bank, payee,
and amount to be paid, among other information. The identification number is
printed at the top of the boleto and encoded as a barcode at the bottom. A
typical boleto malware variant (often detected as Win32/BrobanDel) installs itself
as a browser add-on and monitors webpages for patterns that match a boleto.
When it identifies a boleto, it alters the identification number so that when the
recipient pays it, the money will be paid into an account controlled by the
attacker, rather than the payee’s account. The malware may re-encode the
barcode to match the altered number, or simply corrupt it so that it cannot be
optically scanned, requiring the cashier to enter the identification number by
hand.

New variants of Banload and the other families discussed in this section are
discovered every day, and variants discovered in the future may exhibit different
behaviors than those described here. Visit the Microsoft Malware Protection
Center encyclopedia at https://www.microsoft.com/mmpc for the latest
information about this and other threats.
Guidance
Effectively protecting users from malware requires an active effort on the part of
organizations and individuals. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security
solutions” at the Microsoft Malware Protection Center website at
www.microsoft.com/mmpc.
Specific steps that IT administrators and individual users can take to protect
themselves from malware include the following:


Install security updates for all software as soon as is practical. Promptly
installing security updates remains one of the best ways to defend against
newly discovered threats.



Configure computers to use Microsoft Update rather than Windows Update
to automatically receive updates for a wide range of Microsoft products.
Ensure that security updates from other software vendors are distributed
automatically when possible.

26 WIN32/BANLOAD AND BANKING MALWARE



Install a comprehensive, real-time antimalware product from a reputable
vendor on all of your organization’s computers, and ensure that they receive
frequent, regular definition or signature file updates.



Take advantage of advanced Windows security features such as User
Account Control and AppLocker to prevent unauthorized programs from
running without permission.



Use caution when clicking links to webpages and when opening
attachments to email messages.



Use a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge that offers
advanced protection against phishing and malicious webpages.

Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities, in the context of computer security, are
weaknesses in software that could allow an attacker to
compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the
software. Some of the worst vulnerabilities allow attackers to
exploit the compromised system by causing it to run malicious
code without the user’s knowledge.
Industry-wide vulnerability disclosures
A disclosure, as the term is used in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, is
the revelation of a software vulnerability to the public at large. Disclosures can
come from a variety of sources, including publishers of the affected software,
security software vendors, independent security researchers, and even malware
creators.
The information in this section is compiled from vulnerability disclosure data that
is published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the US government’s
repository of standards-based vulnerability management data at nvd.nist.gov.
The NVD represents all disclosures that have a published CVE (Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier.9
Figure 21 illustrates the number of vulnerability disclosures across the software
industry for each half-year period since 2H12. (See “About this report” on page v
for an explanation of the reporting period nomenclature used in this report.)

9 CVE entries are subject to ongoing revision as software vendors and security researchers publish more

information about vulnerabilities. For this reason, the statistics presented here may differ slightly from
comparable statistics published in previous volumes of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report.

After increasing significantly in 2H14, vulnerability disclosures across the
industry decreased 34.7 percent in 1H15 to just under 3,000, very close to
the level seen a year previously in 1H14.



The large increase in disclosures in 2H14 was predominantly the result of
work performed by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
Coordination Center (CERT/CC) in September and October 2014 to scan
Android applications in the Google Play Store for man-in-the-middle
vulnerabilities using an automated tool.10 CERT/CC determined that
thousands of Android apps fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided
by HTTPS connections, which could allow an attacker on the same network
as an Android device to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the
device.11 This project resulted in the creation of almost 1400 individual CVEs
affecting thousands of different publishers of Android apps and code
libraries. With no comparable research projects having been undertaken in
1H15, the total number of disclosures returned to a more typical level, as
expected.

32 VULNERABILITIES

Vulnerability severity
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized, platformindependent scoring system for rating IT vulnerabilities. The CVSS base metric
assigns a numeric value between 0 and 10 to vulnerabilities according to
severity, with higher scores representing greater severity. (See A Complete
Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2.0 at first.org for
more information.)



Disclosures of medium-severity vulnerabilities—those with CVSS scores
from 4 to 7.9—dropped by nearly half from 2H14, but remained the most
common type of vulnerability in 1H15. A research project in 2H14 uncovered
SSL vulnerabilities in a large number of Android apps in the Google Play
store, explaining the rise and subsequent fall of medium-severity
vulnerabilities. (See page 32 for more information about this project.)



By contrast, the number of disclosures of high-severity and low-severity
vulnerabilities remained mostly stable, with both categories increasing by
less than 2 percent from 1H14 to 2H14. High-severity vulnerabilities
accounted for the second-highest share of vulnerability disclosures in 1H15,
at 32.5 percent, and low-severity vulnerabilities accounted for the smallest
share, at 10.4 percent.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 33



As shown in Figure 23, the highest-severity vulnerabilities—those scoring
9.9 or higher on the CVSS scale—accounted for 7.6 percent of all
vulnerabilities in 1H15.

Vulnerability complexity
Some vulnerabilities are easier to exploit than others, and vulnerability
complexity is an important factor to consider in determining the magnitude of
the threat that a vulnerability poses. A high-severity vulnerability that can only
be exploited under very specific and rare circumstances might require less
immediate attention than a lower-severity vulnerability that can be exploited
more easily.
The CVSS assigns each vulnerability a complexity ranking of Low, Medium, or
High. (See A Complete Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Version 2.0 at first.org for more information about the CVSS complexity ranking
system.) Figure 24 shows complexity trends for vulnerabilities disclosed since
2H12. Note that Low complexity in Figure 24 indicates greater risk, just as High
severity indicates greater risk in Figure 22.

percent from 2H14 to 1H15 to account for 42.4 percent of
all vulnerabilities for the period. A research project in

Operating system, browser, and application vulnerabilities
Comparing vulnerabilities that affect a computer’s operating system to
vulnerabilities that affect other components, such as applications and utilities,
requires a determination of whether the affected component is considered part
of the operating system. This determination is not always simple and
straightforward, given the componentized nature of modern operating systems.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 35

Some programs (media players, for example) ship by default with some
operating system software but can also be downloaded from the software
vendor’s website and installed individually. Linux distributions, in particular, are
often assembled from components developed by different teams, many of
which provide crucial operating functions such as a graphical user interface
(GUI) or Internet browsing.
To facilitate analysis of operating system and browser vulnerabilities, the
Microsoft Security Intelligence Report distinguishes among four different kinds of
vulnerabilities:


Core operating system vulnerabilities are those with at least one operating
system platform enumeration (“/o”) in the NVD that do not also have any
application platform enumerations (“/a”).12



Operating system application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /o
platform enumeration and at least one /a platform enumeration listed in the
NVD, except as described in the next bullet point.



Browser vulnerabilities are those that affect components defined as part of a
web browser, including web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Apple’s
Safari that ship with operating systems, along with third-party browsers such
as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.



Other application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /a platform
enumeration in the NVD that do not have any /o platform enumerations,
except as described in the previous bullet point.

Figure 25 shows industrywide vulnerabilities for operating systems, browsers,
and applications since 2H12.

The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) (www.microsoft.com/sdl) is a free
software development methodology that incorporates security and privacy best
practices throughout all phases of the development process, with the goal of
protecting software users. Using such a methodology can help reduce the

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 39

Exploits
An exploit is a piece of code that uses software vulnerabilities
to access information on a computer or install malware.
Exploits target vulnerabilities in operating systems, web
browsers, applications, or software components that are
installed on a computer.
In some scenarios, targeted components are add-ons that may be pre-installed
by the computer manufacturer before the computer is sold. A user may not
even use the vulnerable add-on or be aware that it is installed. In addition, some
software has no facility for updating itself, so even if the software vendor
publishes an update that fixes the vulnerability, the user may not know that the
update is available or how to obtain it and therefore remains vulnerable to
attack.13

Encounter rate is
the percentage of
computers running
Microsoft real-time
security products
that report a malware encounter.

Software vulnerabilities are enumerated and documented in the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list (cve.mitre.org),
a standardized repository of vulnerability information. Here and
throughout this report, exploits are labeled with the CVE
identifier that pertains to the affected vulnerability, if applicable.
In addition, exploits that affect vulnerabilities in Microsoft
software are labeled with the Microsoft Security Bulletin number
that pertains to the vulnerability, if applicable.14

Microsoft real-time security products can detect and block
attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities whether the computer
is affected by the vulnerabilities or not. For example, the CVE-2010-2568 CplLnk
vulnerability has never affected Windows 8, but if a Windows 8 user receives a
malicious file that attempts to exploit that vulnerability, Windows Defender is
designed to detect and block it anyway. Encounter data provides important
information about which products and vulnerabilities are being targeted by

attackers, and by what means. However, the statistics presented in this report
should not be interpreted as evidence of successful exploit attempts, or of the
relative vulnerability of computers to different exploits.
Figure 27 shows the prevalence of different types of exploits detected by
Microsoft antimalware products from 3Q14 to 2Q15, by encounter rate.
Encounter rate is the percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time
security products that report a malware encounter. For example, the encounter
rate for Java exploit attempts in 2Q15 was 0.35 percent, meaning that 0.35
percent of computers running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q15
encountered Java exploit attempts, and 99.65 percent did not. In other words, a
computer selected at random would have had about a 0.35 percent chance of
encountering a Java exploit attempt in 2Q15. Only computers whose users have
opted in to provide data to Microsoft are considered when calculating
encounter rates.15 See page 58 for more information about the encounter rate
metric.



Computers that report more than one type of exploit are counted for each
type detected.



Encounters with exploit kits decreased by more than a third between 4Q14
and 2Q15, but remained the most commonly encountered type of exploit in
the second half of the year, with an encounter rate more than three times as
high as the next most common type of exploit. See “Exploit kits” on page 44
for more information about these exploits.

Encounters with
exploit kits
decreased by more
than a third, but
remained the most
commonly
encountered type
of exploit in 2H15.


The number of encounters with exploits that target
operating systems remained mostly stable in 1H15, becoming
the second most commonly encountered type of exploits during
the period. See “Operating system exploits” on page 49 for
more information.

Encounters with Java exploits decreased each quarter,
becoming the third most commonly encountered type of exploit
in 1H15. See “Java exploits” on page 47 for more information.


The “Other” category increased from very low levels in
1Q15 and previous periods to become the third most commonly
encountered exploit category in 2Q15, mostly because of
encounters involving Win32/Sdbby. Sdbby is a generic
detection for malware that bypasses the User Account Control (UAC)
prompt to gain administrative privileges on a computer. It was encountered
at very low volumes in 1Q15, then became the fourth most commonly
encountered exploit family in 2Q15.



The number of encounters involving other types of exploits remained mostly
stable during the second half of the year, and each accounted for a small
percentage of total exploits.

Exploit families



Exploit kits accounted for six of the 10 most commonly encountered exploits
during 1H15. See “Exploit kits” on page 44 for more information about
exploit kits.



Exploits targeting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) have gone from
seven of the top 10 individual exploits detected in 2H13 to none in 1H15. A
number of changes that were made to Java and Internet Explorer over the
past two years have made it much more difficult for attackers to take
advantage of Java-based vulnerabilities, which is the most likely explanation
for this significant decrease. (See “Java exploits” on page 47 for more
information.)



CVE-2010-2568, the most commonly targeted individual vulnerability in
1H15, is a vulnerability in Windows Shell. Detections are often identified as
variants in the Win32/CplLnk family, although several other malware families
attempt to exploit the vulnerability as well. An attacker exploits CVE-20102568 by creating a malformed shortcut file—typically distributed through
social engineering or other methods—that forces a vulnerable computer to
load a malicious file when the shortcut icon is displayed in Windows
Explorer. The vulnerability was first discovered being used by the malware
family Win32/Stuxnet in mid-2010, and it has since been exploited by a
number of other families, many of which predated the disclosure of the
vulnerability and were subsequently adapted to attempt to exploit it.
Microsoft published Security Bulletin MS10-046 in August 2010 to address

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 43

the issue, and Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have never been vulnerable to
exploits of CVE-2010-2568.


HTML/IframeRef is a generic detection for specially formed HTML inline
frame (IFrame) tags that redirect to remote websites that contain malicious
content. More properly considered exploit downloaders than true exploits,
these malicious pages use a variety of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in
browsers and plug-ins. The only commonality is that the attacker uses an
inline frame to deliver the exploits to users. The exact exploit delivered and
detected by one of these inline frames might be changed frequently.



CVE-2014-6332 is a vulnerability in Windows Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE) that can be used to launch remote attacks on a computer through
Internet Explorer in some circumstances. Microsoft released Security Bulletin
MS14-064 in November 2014 to address this issue. See “The life and times of
an exploit” on pages 3–10 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume
18 (July–December 2014), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for
more information about this vulnerability and what Microsoft has done to
mitigate it.

Exploit kits
Exploit kits are collections of exploits bundled together and sold as commercial
software or as a service. Prospective attackers buy or rent exploit kits on
malicious hacker forums and through other illegitimate outlets. A typical kit
comprises a collection of webpages that contain exploits for several
vulnerabilities in popular web browsers and browser add-ons. When the
attacker installs the kit on a malicious or compromised web server, visitors who
don’t have the appropriate security updates installed are at risk of having their
computers compromised through drive-by download attacks. (See page 105 for
more information about drive-by downloads.)

Microsoft security products detect and block the characteristic techniques that a
number of common exploit kits use to infect computers, along with several



Overall, encounters with Java exploits continued to decrease significantly in
1H15. This decrease is likely caused by several important changes in the way
web browsers evaluate and execute Java applets:


The IExtensionValidation interface in Internet Explorer 11, released in late

IExtensionValidation
in Internet Explorer
11 provides a
mechanism for security software to
validate that a
webpage is safe
before allowing
instantiation of
ActiveX controls.


2013, provides a mechanism for security software to validate
that a webpage is safe before allowing instantiation of ActiveX
controls, such as the control that hosts embedded Java applets.
If a webpage is determined to be malicious, the ActiveX controls
are blocked from loading, and the actual Java exploit itself is
therefore never encountered. (See “Exploit detection with
Internet Explorer and IExtensionValidation” on page 55 for more
information.) Subsequent Internet Explorer security updates
released in 2014 added an isolated heap mechanism and a
deferred-free method to mitigate use-after-free bugs, which
further hardened Internet Explorer against Java exploitation.


Beginning with Java 7 update 51, released in January

2014, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) requires Java applets
running in web browsers to be digitally signed by default.

In September 2014, Microsoft published updates for versions 8 through
11 of Internet Explorer to begin blocking out-of-date ActiveX controls,
including controls that host older versions of the JRE in the browser. As
explained in this section, the most commonly encountered Java exploits
all target vulnerabilities that were addressed with security updates years
ago, but remain present in out-of-date Java installations. When a
webpage attempts to load one of the vulnerable versions of Java in
Internet Explorer with the update applied, the control is blocked by
default and the user is urged to update Java to a more secure version.

CVE-2012-1723, the most commonly encountered individual Java exploit in
2Q15 and the second most common in 1Q15, is a type-confusion
vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that is exploited by
tricking the JRE into treating one type of variable like another type. Oracle
confirmed the existence of the vulnerability in June 2012, and addressed it

the same month with its June 2012 Critical Patch Update. The vulnerability
was observed being exploited in the wild beginning in early July 2012, and
has been used in a number of exploit kits.
For more information about this exploit, see the entry
“The rise of a new Java vulnerability - CVE-2012-1723”
(August 1, 2012) in the Microsoft Malware Protection
Center (MMPC) blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc.



Obfuscator is a generic detection for programs that have
been modified by malware obfuscation, often in an
attempt to avoid detection by security software. Files
identified as Java/Obfuscator can represent exploits that
target many different Java vulnerabilities.



CVE-2010-0840 is a JRE vulnerability that was first
disclosed in March 2010 and addressed by Oracle with a
security update the same month. The vulnerability was
previously exploited by some versions of the Blackhole exploit kit (detected
as JS/Blacole), which has been inactive in recent years.



CVE-2012-0507 allows an unsigned Java applet to gain elevated permissions
and potentially have unrestricted access to a host system outside its
sandbox environment. The vulnerability is a logic error that allows attackers
to run code with the privileges of the current user, which means that an
attacker can use it to perform reliable exploitation on other platforms that
support the JRE, including Apple Mac OS X, Linux, VMWare, and others.
Oracle released a security update in February 2012 to address the issue.



CVE-2013-0422 first appeared in January 2013 as a zero-day vulnerability.
CVE-2013-0422 is a package access check vulnerability that allows an
untrusted Java applet to access code in a trusted class, which then loads the
attacker’s own class with elevated privileges. Oracle published a security
update to address the vulnerability on January 13, 2013.
For more information about CVE-2013-0422, see the entry “A technical
analysis of a new Java vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422)” (January 20, 2013) in

1H15. An attacker exploits the vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) by creating a
malformed shortcut file that forces a vulnerable computer to load a
malicious file when the shortcut icon is displayed in Windows Explorer.
Microsoft released Security Bulletin MS10-046 in August 2010 to address this
issue.

more information about this vulnerability and what Microsoft has done to
mitigate it.


Three of the five most commonly encountered operating system exploits on
Windows computers in 1H15 actually target the Android mobile operating
system published by Google and the Open Handset Alliance. Microsoft
security products detect these threats when Android devices or storage
cards are connected to computers running Windows, or when Android
users knowingly or unknowingly download infected or malicious programs
to their computers before transferring the software to their devices. Most
detections that affect Android involve exploits that enable an attacker or
other user to obtain root privileges on vulnerable Android devices. Device

Encounters involving exploits targeting CVE-2013-2551, a use-after-free
vulnerability in versions 6 through 10 of Internet Explorer, accounted for the
largest share of browser-related exploit encounters in 2H14, then fell to
negligible levels in 1H15 as exploit kit authors dropped them in favor of
exploits targeting CVE-2013-7331.

Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and IExtensionValidation
IExtensionValidation is an interface introduced in Internet Explorer 11 that realtime security software can implement to block ActiveX controls from loading on
malicious pages. When Internet Explorer loads a webpage that includes ActiveX
controls, if the security software has implemented IExtensionValidation, the
browser calls the security software to scan the HTML and script content on the
page before loading the controls themselves. If the security software determines
that the page is malicious (for example, if it identifies the page as an exploit kit
landing page), it can direct Internet Explorer to prevent individual controls or the
entire page from loading.
Figure 38. Internet Explorer 11 can block pages that contain ActiveX controls if security software determines that the page is malicious

Figure 39 shows the types of ActiveX controls identified on malicious webpages
in Internet Explorer 11 for each quarter in 2014.

Exploits used in targeted attacks
A targeted attack is an attack against the computers or networks of a specific
group of companies or individuals. This type of attack usually attempts to gain
access to the computer or network before trying to steal information or disrupt
the infected computers. Figure 40 lists some of the exploits Microsoft has
observed being used in targeted attacks in 1H15.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 57

Malware and unwanted
software
Most attempts by malware to infect computers are
unsuccessful. More than three-quarters of Internet-connected
personal computers worldwide are protected by real-time
security software that constantly monitors the computers and
network traffic for threats and blocks them before they can
infect the computers, if possible. Therefore, a comprehensive
understanding of the malware landscape requires
consideration of infection attempts that are blocked as well as
infections that are removed.
Microsoft uses two different metrics to measure malware and unwanted
software prevalence:16


Encounter rate is simply the percentage of computers running Microsoft
real-time security products that report a malware encounter.17 For example,
the encounter rate for the malware family JS/Bondat in Mexico in 2Q15 was
4.2 percent. This data means that, of the computers in Mexico that were
running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q15, 4.2 percent reported
encountering the Bondat family, and 95.8 percent did not. Encountering a
threat does not mean the computer has been infected. Only computers
whose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft are considered
when calculating encounter rates.18

16 Microsoft regularly reviews and refines its data collection methodology to improve its scope and accuracy.

For this reason, the statistics presented in this volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report may differ
slightly from comparable statistics in previous volumes.
17 Encounter rate does not include threats that are blocked by a web browser before being detected by
antimalware software. In particular, IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer 11 enables security software to
block pages that contain exploits from loading. (See “Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and
IExtensionValidation” on page 55 for information about IExtensionValidation and the threats it blocks.) For this
reason, encounter rate figures may not fully reflect all of the threats encountered by computer users.
18 For information about the products and services that provide data for this report, see “Appendix B: Data
sources” on page 129.

58 MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE



Computers cleaned per mille, or CCM, is an infection rate metric that is
defined as the number of computers cleaned for every 1,000 unique
computers that run the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free tool
distributed through Microsoft update services that removes more than 200
highly prevalent or serious threats from computers. Because it is not a realtime tool, the MSRT only detects and removes threats that are already
present on the computer; it does not block infection attempts as they
happen.

Figure 41 illustrates the difference between these two metrics.

Figures do not include Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout. See “Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout” on page 60 for more information.

As Figure 41 shows, and as one would expect, malware encounters are much
more common than malware infections. On average, about 17.0 percent of
reporting computers worldwide encountered malware over the past four
quarters. At the same time, the MSRT removed malware from about 7.1 out of
every 1,000 computers, or 0.71 percent. Together, encounter and infection rate
information can help provide a broader picture of the malware landscape by
offering different perspectives on how malware propagates and how computers
get infected.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 59

Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout
Where noted, the figures in this report omit detections of Win32/Brantall,
Win32/Rotbrow, and Win32/Filcout. These three families were involved in an
incident in which a rogue developer with access to commercial source code
modified the source code to serve as a stealth distribution method for malware
without being detected by major security software vendors. When the
modification was discovered, it resulted in a significant installed base of
commercial software being reclassified as malicious, which had an outsized
effect on infection rates. Microsoft believes that the unmodified infection and
encounter figures do not create an accurate picture of the worldwide threat
landscape over the past year and a half. As a result, totals for the Brantall,
Filcout, and Rotbrow families have been removed from the infection and
encounter figures presented here where appropriate, as noted.
See “The Sefnit saga: a timeline” on pages 57–64 of Microsoft Security
Intelligence Report, Volume 17 (January–June 2014), available from the Microsoft
Download Center, for a more in-depth explanation of the incident, along with
detection statistics and a timeline of events.
Malware and unwanted software worldwide
The telemetry data generated by Microsoft security products from computers
whose administrators or users choose to opt in to provide data to Microsoft
includes information about the location of the computer, as determined by IP
geolocation. This data makes it possible to compare infection and encounter
rates, patterns, and trends in different locations around the world.19

19 For more information about this process, see the entry “Determining the Geolocation of Systems Infected

with Malware” (November 15, 2011) in the Microsoft Cyber Trust Blog (blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust).



Locations in Figure 42 are ordered by the number of computers reporting
detections in 1H15.



As Figure 41 on page 59 illustrates, the worldwide encounter rate increased
slightly in 1Q15 before decreasing again in 2Q15, and this pattern is reflected
in several of the locations in Figure 42 as well. India, France, Turkey, the
United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada all had small encounter rate increases
in the first quarter of 2015, followed by decreases to around the same level
as 2Q14. In general, however, encounter rates remained largely stable
through the first half of 2015 in all of these locations, without any unusually
large increases or decreases.



The browser modifiers Win32/KipodToolsCby and Win32/CouponRuc and
the adware family Win32/SaverExtension, the three most commonly
encountered families worldwide in 1H15, were also the three most
commonly encountered families in the United States, France, Turkey, the
United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada, and were all in the top six families
encountered in Russia and India. See “Threat families” beginning on page 74
for more information about these and other malware and unwanted
software families.



Encounters in the United States in 1H15 were dominated by unwanted
software, which accounted for nine of the ten most commonly encountered
families. Of these, six were browser modifiers, including CouponRuc and

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 61

KipodToolsCby, the first and third most commonly detected threat families
in the US, respectively.
The browser modifiers KipodToolsCby, CouponRuc, and Win32/IeEnablerCby
were the most commonly detected families in Brazil in 1H15. Families that ranked
unusually high in Brazil included Win32/Banload (ranked fourth in Brazil, 54th
worldwide), which is usually used to steal login credentials for Brazilian banks,
and the worm family JS/Proslikefan (14th in Brazil, 101st worldwide). (See


Encounters in Russia were led by Win32/Peals, a family
of trojans, and the downloader family Win32/Ogimant, which
has a Russian-language interface and masquerades as a
downloader for peer-to-peer and torrent services. Detections of
Ogimant in Russia decreased from 3.6 percent in 1Q15 to 0.75
percent in 2Q15, but it remained the second most commonly
detected family in Russia in 1H15, overall, behind Peals. Other
families that were unusually common in Russia in 1H15 included
the trojan family Win32/Radonskra (ranked ninth in Russia, 84th
worldwide) and the generic trojan detection Win32/Peaac (10th
in Russia, 48th worldwide).



The mix of threats encountered in India and Turkey were largely similar to
the worldwide mix, but each location also reported significant encounters
with a threat that appeared to be strongly targeted at a specific region. The
worm family MSIL/Mofin (ranked 12th in India, 115th worldwide) was
unusually common in India, where more than 85 percent of all Mofin
encounters occurred in 1H15. And the trojan family Win32/BeeVry (11th in
Turkey, 134th worldwide) was unusually common in Turkey, where more
than 98 percent of all BeeVry encounters occurred in 1H15.



As is typically the case, the threat landscape in China in 1H15 was dominated
by malware families that are much less common worldwide. Of the threats
most commonly encountered in China, only the generic detections
Win32/Obfuscator, INF/Autorun, and Win32/Dynamer and the trojan family
Win32/Ramnit were also commonly encountered worldwide. All of the most
commonly encountered families in China in 1H15 were malware families. The
most commonly detected unwanted software family in China
(KipodToolsCby) ranked 48th there overall. Families that were unusually

prevalent in China included the virus DOS/JackTheRipper (ranked second in
China, 119th worldwide), the downloader HTML/Adodb (fifth in China, 108th
worldwide), and the worm ALisp/Kenilfe (seventh in China, 125th worldwide).


The downloader family W97M/Adnel was unusually prevalent in the United
Kingdom (ranked 12th in the UK, 98th worldwide).



The rogue security software family JS/FakeCall was unusually prevalent in
Canada (ranked 11th in Canada, 96th worldwide).

For a different perspective on threat patterns worldwide, Figure 43 shows the
infection and encounter rates in locations around the world in 2Q15.

As in 2H14, exploit kits were relatively rare in the locations with the
highest encounter rates. JS/Axpergle, the most commonly encountered
exploit kit worldwide in 1H15, ranked no higher than 34th in any of the
locations with the highest encounter rates.



Unwanted software was highly prevalent in these
locations, as it was worldwide in 1H15. The browser
modifiers Win32/KipodToolsCby and

was more than twice as high as in any other country or region.


Families that were unusually prevalent in Indonesia included the exploit
Win32/CplLnk (ranked fifth in Indonesia, 20th worldwide) and the virus
family Win32/Slugin (ranked 13th in Indonesia, 92nd worldwide).



Win32/Macoute, a worm, was unusually prevalent in Algeria (ranked
17th in Algeria, 148th worldwide). Most Macoute encounters worldwide
took place in Algeria and several other locations in Africa, including
Senegal, Ghana, and Tunisia.



The worm family Win32/Vercuser was unusually prevalent in Bangladesh
(ranked 14th in Bangladesh, 102nd worldwide) and a number of nearby
locations, including Nepal, Pakistan, and India.



The locations with the highest infection rates were Iraq, Libya, the Palestinian
territories, Morocco, and Pakistan.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 65



The worm family VBS/Jenxcus was the most common malware family
infecting computers in 1H15 in all of these locations except Morocco,
where it was second. Infection rates for Jenxcus were particularly high
across the Middle East, and low in North America and Europe.



Infections involving the backdoor family MSIL/Bladabindi, which ranked
26th among infecting families worldwide, were particularly common in
Iraq (where it ranked fourth), Libya (third), the Palestinian territories
(11th), and Morocco (seventh). Like Jenxcus, Bladabindi had its greatest
impact in the Middle East.



In Morocco, the most common infecting malware family was the worm
family Win32/Yeltminky, which had its highest infection rate there (a
CCM of 23.8 in Morocco in 2Q15, compared to 3.3 in Algeria, the next
highest location). Yeltminky is a family of worms that spreads by making
copies of itself on all available drives and creating an autorun.inf file to
execute the copies.

Microsoft and partners disrupt the Simda.AT botnet
On April 12, 2015, Interpol and the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit
(DNHTCU) announced the disruption of Backdoor:Win32/Simda.AT, a significant
malware threat affecting more than 770,000 devices in more than 190 countries
and regions.
Win32/Simda is a family of threats that can provide an attacker with backdoor
access to and control of an infected device. They can then steal passwords and
gather information about the device to send to the attacker. The Simda.AT
variant first appeared in 2012, and is often downloaded to a vulnerable device
by a drive-by download. Aside from the information-stealing behavior common
to Simda variants, Simda.AT redirects search traffic from popular websites such
as Bing, Google, and Facebook to its own domain, and can download other
malware from a remote host. Simda was the 55th most commonly encountered
malware family worldwide in 1H15, with the overwhelming majority of
encounters involving the Simda.AT variant.
Figure 48. Average number of Simda-infected devices connecting to the sinkhole each month, April–July, 2015

68 MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE

Interpol coordinated the operation and the DNHTCU, with the support of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), successfully took down Simda.AT’s active
command and control infrastructure across four countries including the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Russia, and the United States. The Microsoft Malware
Protection Center (MMPC) and the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) led the
analysis of the malware threat in partnership with CDI Japan, Kaspersky Lab, and
Trend Micro.
The MMPC activated the Coordinated Malware Eradication (CME) platform to
provide in-depth research, telemetry, samples, and cleaning solutions to law
enforcement and Microsoft partners. This information helped law enforcement
take action against Simda.AT and its infrastructure, while providing remediation
and recovery options for infected devices around the world.
For more information about the takedown and technical information about the
Simda.AT backdoor, see the entry “Microsoft partners with Interpol, industry to
disrupt global malware attack affecting more than 770,000 PCs in past six
months” (April 12, 2015) on the MMPC blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc.
Threat categories
The MMPC classifies individual threats into types based on a number of factors,
including how the threat spreads and what it is designed to do. To simplify the
presentation of this information and make it easier to understand, the Microsoft
Security Intelligence Report groups these types into categories based on
similarities in function and purpose.

The number of encounters for most categories of malware remained stable
or decreased throughout the first half of 2015, with the exception of Trojans,
which increased to 4.5 percent in 2Q15 after dipping slightly in the first
quarter. Encounters with the three most commonly detected trojan families,
Win32/Peals, Win32/Kilim, and Win32/Skeeyah, all increased significantly in
2Q15, contributing to the overall increase, which was partly ameliorated by
the disruption of the Win32/Ramnit family. See “Threat families” beginning
on page 74 for more information about these and other malware and
unwanted software families.

Threat categories by location
Significant differences exist in the types of threats that affect users in different
parts of the world. The spread of malware can be highly dependent on
language and socioeconomic factors as well as on the methods used for
distribution. Some threats are spread using techniques that target people who
speak a particular language or who use online services that are local to a specific

Win32/Obfuscator, the most commonly encountered threat in 1H15, is a
generic detection for programs that have been modified by malware
obfuscation tools. These tools typically use a combination of methods,
including encryption, compression, and anti-debugging or anti-emulation
techniques, to alter malware programs in an effort to hinder analysis or
detection by security products. The output is usually another program that

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 75

keeps the same functionality as the original program but with different code,
data, and geometry.
Encounters involving VBS/Jenxcus declined steadily over the past four
quarters, but it remained the second-most commonly encountered family in
1H15. Jenxcus is a worm coded in VBScript that opens a backdoor on an
infected computer, enabling an attacker to control it remotely. In addition to
spreading via removable drives, Jenxcus was often transmitted
via a fake Adobe Flash Player update from spoofed YouTube
Win32/Gamarue, webpages. Encounters involving Jenxcus decreased significantly
the third most after the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit launched a takedown
commonly en- operation in June of 2014 that successfully disrupted the Jenxcus
botnet. The original owners of the botnet subsequently left the
countered threat in project, but the Jenxcus code is now being used by other



Win32/Gamarue, the third most commonly encountered threat in 1H15, was
especially prevalent in southeast Asia and the Middle East. Gamarue is
commonly distributed via exploit kits and social engineering. Variants have
been observed stealing information from the local computer and
communicating with command-and-control (C&C) servers managed by
attackers. For more information about Gamarue, see the following entries in

encounters were heavily concentrated in Turkey, and were rare elsewhere.
Since then, encounters have increased tenfold from 4Q14 levels, with most
of the increase occurring outside Turkey.


Encounters involving two newly designated generic detections, Win32/Peals
and Win32/Skeeyah, increased rapidly to account for a significant share of
encounters worldwide by 2Q15.



JS/Axpergle, a detection for the Angler exploit kit, is the only exploit-related
family in the top ten in 1H15. See “Exploit families” on page 42 for more
information about Axpergle and other exploit kits.



The encounter rate for Win32/Ramnit decreased from 0.52 percent in 1Q15
to 0.40 percent in 2Q15 following its disruption in February by the European
Cybercrime Center (EC3) with the assistance of the MMPC. For more

Win32/KipodToolsCby and Win32/IeEnablerCby are browser modifiers that
bypass user consent dialogs to install software without the user’s explicit
permission. Microsoft security products started detecting these browser
modifiers in January after Microsoft changed its unwanted software
detection criteria to include attempts to bypass user consent for actions
such as installing new browser add-ons. KipodToolsCby and IeEnablerCby
were both encountered at high levels in 1Q15 as Microsoft security products
detected and removed large numbers of installations from previous periods.
Encounters subsequently decreased significantly in 2Q15, following the
removal of these older installations.

unwanted software.

Win32/CouponRuc is an adware program that installs a

the user from removing it or other add-ons normally, or
changing other browser settings.



Win32/SaverExtension is an adware program that
displays advertisements on webpages without identifying
itself as the source, which is a violation of Microsoft’s
objective criteria for classifying unwanted software.20 It
can also install additional browser extensions that the
user cannot remove normally.



Win32/InstalleRex is a software bundler that installs
unwanted software, including CouponRuc and
SaverExtension. It can be installed by third-party software
bundlers. When it installs itself, it alters its own “Installed On” date in
Programs and Features to be a year older than the actual date of
installation, so that a user who tries to remove it by looking at recently
installed programs might have difficulty identifying it.

Threat families by platform
Malware does not affect all platforms equally. Some threats are spread by
exploits that are ineffective against one or more operating system versions.
Some threats are more common in parts of the world where specific platforms
are more or less popular than elsewhere. In other cases, differences between
platforms might be caused by simple random variation.
As Figure 58 demonstrates, the threats encountered by client and server
platforms tend to be quite different.

20 Microsoft has published the criteria that the company uses to classify programs as unwanted software at

www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx. For programs that have been
classified as unwanted software, Microsoft provides a dispute resolution process to allow for reporting of
potential false positives and to provide software vendors with the opportunity to request investigation of a
rating with which they do not agree.

Unwanted software was encountered significantly more often on client
platforms than on server platforms. Five of the top ten families encountered
by client versions of Windows in 1Q15—Win32/CouponRuc,
Win32/KipodToolsCby, Win32/InstalleRex, Win32/AlterbookSP, and
Win32/SaverExtension—were unwanted software families, compared to just
two (KipodToolsCby and AlterbookSP) of the top ten families
Attackers often use encountered on servers. The discrepancy reflects the very



compromise
vulnerable servers.


PHP/SimpleShell was only the 515th most prevalent
family overall in 2Q15, but ranked 13th on server platforms.
When installed on a compromised web server, it creates a
webpage that an attacker can use to run shell commands on the
server. A number of popular content management systems (CMSes) are
written in the PHP scripting language, including WordPress, Drupal, and
MediaWiki, and attackers often use PHP-based malware to compromise
vulnerable servers for purposes such as sending spam and hosting exploit
kit landing pages.

Figure 59 and Figure 60 demonstrate how detections of the most prevalent
malware and unwanted software families in 2Q15 ranked differently on different
operating system/service pack combinations.



Encounters involving JS/Axpergle, a detection for the Angler exploit kit and
the only exploit-related family in the top ten in 1H15, were almost entirely
confined to computers running Windows 7; although Axpergle ranked first
on that platform, it ranked 82nd on Windows Vista and ranked outside the
top 100 on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. The malicious webpages that
exploit kits use to spread malware often include scripts that detect certain
aspects of the computer’s computing environment and only present their
exploits to computers that meet criteria specified by the attacker. The Angler
exploit kit clearly affects Windows 7 far more than other platforms, which
may partially be caused by the integration of Adobe Flash Player into
Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and 8.1. The Angler exploit kit relies heavily
on exploiting vulnerabilities in old, out-of-date versions of Flash Player,
which must be installed as an add-on and updated separately from Internet
Explorer in versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. Because Flash Player is
integrated into Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, it receives
security updates through Windows Update and Microsoft Update along with
other operating system components, which makes it easier for users to stay
current on security updates for the component.



Apart from Axpergle, the list of the most commonly encountered malware
families was largely consistent from platform to platform. Win32/Peals,

Win32/Skeeyah, and Win32/Obfuscator were all among the five most



Unlike malware, unwanted software delivery mechanisms typically make little
effort to distinguish between different platforms, and as a result the list of
the most commonly encountered unwanted software families is almost
identical on each supported platform.

Home and enterprise threats
The usage patterns of home users and enterprise users tend to be very different.
Enterprise users typically use computers to perform business functions while
connected to a network, and may have limitations placed on their Internet and
email usage. Home users are more likely to connect to the Internet directly or
through a home router and to use their computers for entertainment purposes,
such as playing games, watching videos, shopping, and communicating with
friends. These different usage patterns mean that home users tend to be
exposed to a different mix of computer threats than enterprise users.
The infection telemetry data produced by Microsoft antimalware products and
tools includes information about whether the infected computer belongs to an
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. Such domains are used
almost exclusively in enterprise environments, and computers that do not
belong to a domain are more likely to be used at home or in other nonenterprise contexts. Comparing the threats encountered by domain-joined
computers and non-domain computers can provide insights into the different
ways attackers target enterprise and home users and which threats are more
likely to succeed in each environment.



Enterprise environments typically implement defense-in-depth measures,
such as enterprise firewalls, that prevent a certain amount of malware from
reaching users’ computers. Consequently, enterprise computers tend to

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 83

encounter malware at a lower rate than consumer computers. As Figure 61
shows, the encounter rate for consumer computers was about 2.5 times as
high as the rate for enterprise computers in 1H15.
In addition to encountering less malware in general, computers in enterprise
environments tend to encounter different kinds of threats than
Enterprise consumer computers, as shown in Figure 62. Non-domain
computers encountered disproportionate amounts of unwanted

One password stealer in particular, Win32/Dyzap, was encountered by
domain-based computers more than four times as often as non-domain
computers (an encounter rate of 0.12 percent on domain-based
computers, compared to 0.03 percent on non-domain computers.)
Dyzap steals login credentials for a long list of banking websites using
man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks. It is usually installed on the infected
computer by the downloader family Win32/Upatre, which is typically
delivered via social engineering techniques that target enterprise
audiences (for example, spam messages that mimic business faxes or
overnight package delivery notifications).

Win32/Conficker, the browser modifier
Win32/AlterbookSP, the downloader family
Conficker was disWin32/Upatre, and the trojan family Win32/Peals.



Conficker is a worm that was disrupted several years ago,



AlterbookSP is a browser add-on that formerly displayed
behaviors of unwanted software. Recent versions of the
add-on no longer meet Microsoft detection criteria, and
are no longer considered unwanted software.



Upatre installs malware and unwanted software on the
affected computer without the user’s consent. It is
frequently distributed as an attachment to spam email

Security software use
Recent releases of the MSRT collect and report details about the state of realtime antimalware software on a computer, if the computer’s administrator has
chosen to opt in to provide data to Microsoft. This telemetry data makes it
possible to analyze security software usage patterns around the world and
correlate them with infection rates. Figure 65 shows the percentage of
computers worldwide that the MSRT found to be protected or unprotected by
real-time security software each quarter in 2H14 and 1H15.

A typical computer runs the MSRT three times each quarter, once for each
monthly version of the tool that Microsoft releases. In Figure 65, “Protected”
represents computers that had real-time security software active and up-todate every time the MSRT ran during a quarter; “Intermittently protected”
represents computers that had security software active during one or more
MSRT executions, but not all of them. “Unprotected” represents computers
that did not have security software active during any MSRT executions that
quarter.



Overall, about three-fourths of computers worldwide were found to be
always protected at every monthly MSRT execution in each of the past four
quarters, varying between 71.4 percent and 74.3 percent.



Computers that never reported running security software accounted for
between 18.8 and 19.3 percent of computers worldwide each quarter.
Intermittently protected computers—those that were found to be running
real-time security software during at least one MSRT execution in a quarter,
but not all of them—accounted for between 6.4 and 9.9 percent of
computers each quarter.

Computers that do not run real-time security software are at significantly greater
risk of malware infection than computers that do. Figure 66 compares infection
rates with protection levels worldwide for each of the last four quarters.

Locations with the most computers reporting as fully unprotected include
Libya, at 41.7 percent; Iraq, at 39.5 percent; and Azerbaijan, at 32.5 percent.

Only 10.0 percent of computers running Windows 8.1 reported being
unprotected during every MSRT execution each quarter on average, about
half of the rate reported by computers running any other supported client
version of Windows. At the same time, Windows 8.1 had a higher rate of
intermittent protection than any other platform, primarily because of active
security products expiring during the period. In most cases, this is probably
because of commercial security products pre-installed on new computers
with trial subscriptions that expire within a few months unless the purchaser
pays to extend the subscription.



The reasons computers go unprotected can vary significantly by platform, as
Figure 72 illustrates.



On Windows Vista and Windows 7, unprotected computers predominantly
report having no antimalware software installed at all. On Windows 8 and
Windows 8.1, Windows Defender is enabled by default if no other
antimalware software is present, so the number of computers reporting no
antimalware software is very low.



On Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, expired versions of commercial
antimalware products that are no longer receiving signature updates
account for the largest percentage of unprotected computers.

Advanced Threat Protection takes malware defense to the next level
Computer security is a constant arms race: security professionals and
antimalware vendors continually seek ways to better protect computers and
people from harm, while attackers continually look for ways to defeat those
protections. Conventional antimalware products offer protection against known
threats, but are significantly less effective against unknown and unidentifiable
malware. The advent of targeted attack groups, such as the one described in
“STRONTIUM: A profile of a persistent and motivated adversary” beginning on
page 3, has raised the bar for defenders, as these groups often have the
resources to craft custom malware variants and test them against popular
security products to ensure that they will not be detected. Although security
94 MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE

software vendors try to respond to new threats with detection signature updates
as quickly as possible, new malware variants may still have several crucial hours
or days to compromise computers, free from detection.
Office 365 and Exchange Online seek to close that gap for their customers with
Advanced Threat Protection, which was introduced earlier this year. For years,
Exchange Online has offered customers multiple layers of protection from
malicious files, including scanning incoming email attachments with multiple
antimalware engines from different vendors to take advantage of a broad set of
detection signatures and capabilities. Now, Advanced Threat Protection
provides an additional layer of defense against threats and malicious links that
have never been seen before.

Safe attachments
Using a real-time security software product from a reputable vendor and
keeping the detection signatures up-to-date remains one of the best ways
individuals and organizations can protect themselves against most of the threats
they face. Antimalware software relies predominately on detection signatures
written to target specific malicious binaries, or groups of closely related threats
that can be detected heuristically. This approach can be a very effective defense
against most malware, which attackers typically try to distribute widely in order
to compromise large numbers of computers for their purposes. Unfortunately,
conventional antimalware software is often less effective against targeted attacks
mounted by groups such as STRONTIUM (see page 3). These groups, which
focus on targeting computers at specific institutions, often use specially crafted
threats that they test against popular antimalware solutions ahead of time to
MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 95

ensure that they will not be detected. By the time detection signatures are
available to stop such a threat, it may have already compromised the
organization.
Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection adds a new layer of defense
against email-borne threats that uses behavioral analysis to detect incoming
files that may be harmful, and blocks them before they can reach their intended
recipients. When an incoming message includes a potentially dangerous
attached file, Exchange Online launches it in a detonation chamber—a virtual
sandboxed environment in which potential threats can run without posing harm
to any other resources—and monitors it for malicious behavior such as
suspicious registry changes, attempts to access memory dumps, changes to
executables, and other actions that malware characteristically takes. This
monitoring makes it possible to detect and block threats that have never been
seen before and for which no detection signatures are available. Exchange
Online Advanced Threat Protection includes anti-sandbox detection features
such as vulnerability detection to combat advanced threats that avoid taking
malicious actions when they determine they are being run in a virtual machine.
Figure 74. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection notifies administrators when malware is detected

Administrators can configure how Exchange Online reacts when it determines
that an attachment contains malware. Exchange Online can be configured to
block delivery of the message, notify administrators, and include a copy of the
blocked message so they can analyze it themselves and determine whether
additional action is necessary. The process of analyzing a message typically
takes about four to five minutes; administrators can set a 30 minute time limit for

96 MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE

analysis, after which the message will either be delivered or blocked, as
administrators see fit.

Safe links
In addition to sending malware to recipients directly, attackers often send email
messages that contain links to malware or drive-by download pages, in hopes
that the recipients will click the links and become infected. To provide protection
against malicious links, administrators can configure Exchange Online Advanced
Threat Protection to rewrite any links in incoming messages to proxy through
the Exchange Online service. When a user clicks on a rewritten link, Exchange
Online checks the intended destination URL against its database of malicious
URLs. If the URL is not determined to be malicious, the user is quickly and
seamlessly redirected to their intended destination. If the URL is determined to
be malicious, a blocking page is displayed instead. Exchange Online Advanced
Threat Protection checks each URL at the time the link is clicked, which means it
can protect users from malicious links that were not known to be malicious at
the time the message was originally sent.

Figure 76. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection blocks malicious links in email messages

Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection can be configured to track when
users clicks malicious links to help administrators monitor potential targeted

Customers with privacy or compliance concerns can disable the link tracking
feature.
Advanced Threat Protection is available for subscribers of select Exchange or

98 MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE

Malicious websites
Attackers often use websites to conduct phishing attacks or
distribute malware. Malicious websites typically appear to be
completely legitimate, and provide no outward indicators of
their malicious nature even to experienced computer users. In
many cases, these sites are legitimate websites that have been
compromised by malware, SQL injection, or other techniques
in efforts by attackers to take advantage of the trust users have
invested in such sites. To help protect users from malicious
webpages, Microsoft and other browser vendors have
developed filters that keep track of sites that host malware and
phishing attacks and display prominent warnings when users
try to navigate to them.
The information in this section is compiled from a variety of sources, including
telemetry data produced by SmartScreen Filter (in Internet Explorer versions 8
through 11 and pre-release versions of Microsoft Edge) and the Phishing Filter
(in Internet Explorer 7), from a database of known active phishing and malware
hosting sites reported by users of Internet Explorer and other Microsoft products
and services, and from malware data provided by Microsoft antimalware
technologies. (See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 125 for more
information about the products and services that provided data for this report.)

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 99

Figure 77. SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer blocks reported phishing and malware distribution sites to

Phishing sites
Microsoft gathers information about phishing sites and impressions from
phishing impressions that are generated by users who choose to enable the
Phishing Filter or SmartScreen Filter.21 A phishing impression is a single instance
of a user attempting to visit a known phishing site with SmartScreen Filter
enabled and being warned, as illustrated in Figure 78.



Numbers of active phishing sites and phishing impressions both increased
between February and July, indicative of a general increase in phishing
activity. Because phishers are frequently observed using campaigns to drive
large amounts of traffic to a relatively small number of pages, however, the
two metrics are generally not strongly correlated, and the dual increase
through June and July may be largely coincidental.

Target institutions
Some types of sites tend to consistently draw many more impressions per site
than others. Figure 80 shows the breakdown of phishing impressions by
category as reported by SmartScreen Filter.

Financial institutions have always been popular phishing targets because of
their potential for providing direct illicit access to victims’ bank accounts.
Sites that targeted financial institutions accounted for the largest number of
active phishing attacks during the period, as well as the second largest
number of impressions. (See “Win32/Banload and Banking Malware” on
page 21 for information about regional problems with banking malware in
Brazil.)



Phishing sites that targeted online services received the largest share of
impressions during the period, and accounted for the second largest
number of active phishing URLs.



The other three categories each accounted for a small percentage of both
sites and impressions.

Global distribution of phishing sites and clients
Phishing impression information from SmartScreen Filter includes anonymized
information about the IP addresses of the clients making the reports, as well as
the IP addresses of the phishing sites themselves. Performing geographic
lookups on these addresses makes it possible to analyze patterns among both



SmartScreen Filter detected approximately 5.0 phishing sites per 1,000
Internet hosts worldwide in 1H15.



Locations hosting higher than average concentrations of phishing sites
include Bulgaria (98.5 per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1Q15), Libya (15.6), and
Belize (14.5). Locations with low concentrations of phishing sites include
Taiwan (1.2), the United Arab Emirates (1.4), and Korea (1.6).

Malware hosting sites
SmartScreen Filter helps provide protection against sites that are known to host
malware, in addition to phishing sites. SmartScreen Filter uses file and URL

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 103

reputation data and Microsoft antimalware technologies to determine whether
sites distribute unsafe content. As with phishing sites, Microsoft collects
anonymized data regarding how many people visit each malware hosting site
and uses the information to improve SmartScreen Filter and to better combat
malware distribution.

As with phishing sites and impressions, malware hosting sites and
impressions rarely correlate strongly with one another. The number of
impressions remained largely stable each month from February through
July, while the number of active malware hosting sites tracked by
SmartScreen Filter increased sharply from February to April, then retreated
to lower levels for the remainder of the period.



Locations with large concentrations of malware hosting sites included Brazil
(41.0 per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1H15), Costa Rica (38.8), and Russia (23.9).
Locations with low concentrations of malware hosting sites included Taiwan
(2.8), Saudi Arabia (4.3), and Finland (4.4).

Drive-by download sites
A drive-by download site is a website that hosts one or more exploits that target
vulnerabilities in web browsers and browser add-ons. Users with vulnerable
computers can be infected with malware simply by visiting such a website, even
without attempting to download anything.
Drive-by download pages are usually hosted on legitimate websites to which an
attacker has posted exploit code. Attackers gain access to legitimate sites
through intrusion or by posting malicious code to a poorly secured web form,
like a comment field on a blog. Compromised sites can be hosted anywhere in
the world and concern nearly any subject imaginable, making it difficult for even
an experienced user to identify a compromised site from a list of search results.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 105

Figure 85. One example of a drive-by download attack

Search engines such as Bing have taken a number of measures to help protect
users from drive-by downloads. As Bing indexes webpages, they are assessed
for malicious elements or malicious behavior. Because the owners of
compromised sites are usually victims themselves, the sites are not removed
from the Bing index. Instead, clicking the link in the list of search results displays
a prominent warning, saying that the page may contain malicious software, as
shown in Figure 86.

Guidance: Protecting users from unsafe websites
One of the best ways organizations can protect their users from malicious and
compromised websites is by mandating the use of web browsers with
appropriate protection features built in and by promoting safe browsing
practices. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security solutions” at

Malware at Microsoft:
Dealing with threats in the
Microsoft environment
Microsoft IT
Microsoft IT provides information technology services internally for Microsoft
employees and resources. Microsoft IT manages more than 600,000 devices for
more than 150,000 users across more than 100 countries and regions worldwide.
Safeguarding a computing infrastructure of this size requires implementation of
strong security policies, technology to help keep malware off the network and
away from mission-critical resources, and dealing with malware outbreaks swiftly
and comprehensively when they occur.
This section of the report compares the potential impact of malware to the levels
of antimalware compliance from more than 500,000 workstation computers and
devices managed by Microsoft IT between January and June 2015. This data is
compiled from multiple sources, including System Center Endpoint Protection
(SCEP), Windows Defender, DirectAccess, forensics, and manual submission of
suspicious files. Comparing the nature and volume of the malware detected on
these computers to the level of protection they receive can illustrate significant
trends and provide insights as to the effectiveness of antimalware software and
security best practices.
Antimalware usage
Real-time antimalware software is required on all user devices that connect to
the Microsoft corporate network. System Center Endpoint Protection 2012
(SCEP) and Windows Defender are the antimalware solutions that Microsoft IT
deploys to its users. To be considered compliant with antimalware policies and
standards, user computers must be running the latest version of the SCEP or
Defender client, antimalware signatures must be no more than six days old, and
real-time protection must be enabled.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 111

Figure 88 shows the level of antimalware noncompliance in the Microsoft user
workstation environment for each month in 1H15.

Despite a small drop in compliance at the beginning of the year that was mostly
related to internal testing of current and future versions of Windows, the
average monthly compliance rate at Microsoft exceeded 98 percent during the
first half of the year. In any network of this size, it is almost inevitable that a small
number of computers will be in a noncompliant state at any given time. In most
cases, these are computers that are being rebuilt or are otherwise in a state of
change when online, rather than computers that have had their antimalware
software intentionally disabled.
Microsoft IT believes that a compliance rate in excess of 98 percent among
approximately half a million computers is an acceptable level of compliance. In
most cases, attempting to boost a large organization’s compliance rate the rest
of the way to 100 percent will likely be a costly endeavor, and the end result—
100 percent compliance—will be unsustainable over time.
Malware detections
Figure 89 shows the categories of malware and unwanted software that were
most frequently detected at Microsoft in 1H15.

In this section, malware detections are defined as files and processes flagged by
SCEP, regardless of the success or failure of automated containment or
remediation. Malware detections are a measure of attempted malware activity,
and do not necessarily indicate that a computer has been successfully infected.
(Note that the methodology for assessing encounters used elsewhere in this
report counts unique computers with detections, an approach that differs from
the methodology used in this section, in which individual detections are
counted. For example, if a computer encountered one trojan family in February
and another one in June, it would only be counted once for the purposes of
figures such as Figure 49 on page 70. In the preceding Figure 89, it would be
counted twice, once for each detection.)
Adware was the most prevalent category, with nearly one and a half times as
many detections as all other categories combined. The outsized number of
internal adware detections is caused by a pilot project that MSIT has undertaken
with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) to improve detection of
adware and other unwanted software. As this work is evaluated and found to
produce valid and satisfactory results, any improved detection methods will be
incorporated into Microsoft security products for the benefit of customers and
end users.

Executable program files with the .exe extension were the most commonly
detected type of malicious file at Microsoft by a large margin. Many of these
detections were related to the joint effort between MSIT and the MSRC to
improve detection of unwanted software, as noted earlier. Malicious .dll files
were the next most common type of threats, followed by the .tmp and .temp
extensions, typically used for temporary files.
Transmission vectors
Examining the processes targeted by malware can help illustrate the methods
that attackers use to propagate it. Figure 91 lists the top five transmission vectors
used by the malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H15.

File transfer applications

The transmission vector most commonly used by infection attempts detected on
Microsoft computers in 1H15 involved web browsing, followed by file transfers
made through Windows Explorer and scheduled operating system tasks. Cloud
backup and storage services were fourth, followed by file transfer applications,
including peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.
Malware infections
Because almost all of the computers at Microsoft run real-time security software
at all times, most infection attempts are detected and blocked before they are
able to infect the target computer. When Defender or SCEP do disinfect a
computer, it is usually because the software’s signature database has been
updated to enable it to detect a threat that it did not recognize when the
computer first encountered the threat. This lack of recognition may be because
the threat is a new malware family, a new variant of a known family, a known
variant that has been encrypted or otherwise repackaged to avoid detection, or
because of some other reason. The MMPC constantly analyzes malware
samples submitted to it, develops appropriate detection signatures, and deploys
them to customers who use SCEP, Microsoft Security Essentials, and Windows
Defender.
Figure 92 shows the most commonly detected categories of malware and
unwanted software that SCEP and Defender removed from computers at
Microsoft between January and June of 2015.

As this chart shows, detection and infection statistics were significantly different
in 1H15. Adware, which accounted for more than 1.2 million detections at
Microsoft in 1H15, was not discovered on a single computer internally during the
period. Most of the other categories also show clear differences between Figure
89 and Figure 92, although the ordering in the latter chart is significantly
influenced by the low volumes involved.
Figure 93 shows the top 10 file types used by malware to infect computers at
Microsoft in 1H15.

Figure 93 is important because it provides information about threats that
Defender and SCEP did not detect when they were first encountered—and
therefore provides a clue about the areas in which malware authors have been
focusing their efforts in recent months. More than half of the malicious files
removed from computers at Microsoft by Defender and SCEP in 1H15 had the
extension .exe, used by executable program files, with seven extensions
accounting for the remaining files. The .doc extension used for Microsoft Word
binary files was next, followed by .bin, .scr, and “._”, an extension consisting of a
single underscore. Four other file types each accounted for a single removal.
What IT departments can do to protect their users


Evaluate commercially available management tools, develop a plan, and
implement a third-party update mechanism to disseminate non-Microsoft
updates.



Ensure that all software deployed on computers in the environment is
updated regularly. If the software provider offers an automatic update utility
similar to Microsoft Update, ensure that it is enabled by default. See “Turn
automatic updating on or off” at windows.microsoft.com for instructions on
enabling automatic updates of Microsoft software.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 117



Ensure that SmartScreen Filter is enabled in Internet Explorer. See
“SmartScreen Filter: frequently asked questions” at windows.microsoft.com

Firewall, and SmartScreen Filter. See Knowledge Base article KB328010 at
support.microsoft.com, and “Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
Deployment Guide” and “Manage Privacy: SmartScreen Filter and Resulting
Internet Communication” at technet.microsoft.com for instructions.



Set the default configuration for antimalware to enable real-time protection
across all drives, including removable devices.



Enable Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) advanced membership in
Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials in your organization to
protect your enterprise software security infrastructure in the cloud.

Figure 94. Enabling MAPS advanced membership in Windows Defender



Identify business dependencies on Java and develop a plan to minimize its
use where it is not needed.



Use AppLocker to block the installation and use of unwanted software such
as Java or peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. See “AppLocker: Frequently
Asked Questions” at technet.microsoft.com for more information.

118 MALWARE AT MICROSOFT: DEALING WITH THREATS IN THE MICROSOFT ENVIRONMENT



Implement the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET), if possible,
to minimize exploitation of vulnerabilities in all software in your
environment. See technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751 for more
information.



Implement strong password policies, and require employees to change their
passwords periodically.



Strengthen authentication by using smart cards. See “Smart Cards” at
technet.microsoft.com for more information.

Use Network Access Protection (NAP) and DirectAccess (DA) to enforce
compliance policies for firewall, antimalware, and patch management on remote
systems that connect to a corporate network. See “Network Access Protection”

122 MALWARE AT MICROSOFT: DEALING WITH THREATS IN THE MICROSOFT ENVIRONMENT

Appendix A: Threat naming
conventions
Microsoft names the malware and unwanted software that it detects according
to the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) Malware naming
scheme.
This scheme uses the following format:
Figure 95. The Microsoft malware naming convention

When Microsoft analysts research a particular threat, they will determine what
each of the components of the name will be.
Type
The type describes what the threat does on a computer. Worms, trojans, and
viruses are some of the most common types of threats Microsoft detects.
Platform
The platform refers to the operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS X, and
Android) that the threat is designed to work on. Platforms can also include
programming languages and file formats.
Family
A group of threats with the same name is known as a family. Sometimes
different security software companies use different names.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 123

Variant letters
Variant letters are used sequentially for each different version or member of a
family. For example, the detection for the variant “.AF” would have been created
after the detection for the variant “.AE.”
Additional information
Additional information is sometimes used to describe a specific file or
component that is used by another threat in relation to the identified threat. In
the preceding example, the !lnk indicates that the threat is a shortcut file used by
the Backdoor:Win32/Caphaw.D variant, as shortcut files usually use the
extension .lnk.

124 APPENDIX A: THREAT NAMING CONVENTIONS

Appendix B: Data sources
Data included in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is gathered from a
wide range of Microsoft products and services whose users have opted in to
provide usage data. The scale and scope of this telemetry data allows the report
to deliver the most comprehensive and detailed perspective on the threat
landscape that is available in the software industry:


Bing, the search and decision engine from Microsoft, contains technology
that performs billions of webpage scans per year to seek out malicious
content. After such content is detected, Bing displays warnings to users
about it to help prevent infection.



Exchange Online is Microsoft’s hosted email service for business. Exchange
Online antimalware and antispam services scan billions of messages every
year to identify and block spam and malware.



The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) is a free tool that Microsoft
designed to help identify and remove specific prevalent malware families
from customer computers. The MSRT is primarily released as an important
update through Windows Update, Microsoft Update, and Automatic
Updates. A version of the tool is also available from the Microsoft Download
Center. The MSRT was downloaded and executed more than 600 million
times each month on average in 1H15. The MSRT is not a replacement for an
up-to-date real-time antivirus solution.



The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that
provides on-demand scanning and helps remove malware and other
malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for an
up-to-date antivirus solution, because it does not offer real-time protection
and cannot prevent a computer from becoming infected.



Microsoft Security Essentials is a free, easy-to-download real-time
protection product that provides basic, effective antivirus and antispyware
protection for Windows Vista and Windows 7.



Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection (formerly Forefront Client
Security and Forefront Endpoint Protection) is a unified product that
provides protection from malware and unwanted software for enterprise
desktops, laptops, and server operating systems. It uses the Microsoft

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 125

Malware Protection Engine and the Microsoft antivirus signature database
to provide real-time, scheduled, and on-demand protection.


Office 365 is the Microsoft Office subscription service for business and home
users. Select business plans include access to Exchange Online with
Advanced Threat Protection.



SmartScreen Filter, a feature in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, offers
users protection against phishing sites and sites that host malware. Microsoft
maintains a database of phishing and malware sites reported by users of
Internet Explorer and other Microsoft products and services. When a user
attempts to visit a site in the database with the filter enabled, the browser
displays a warning and blocks navigation to the page.



Windows Defender in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 provides real-time
scanning and removal of malware and unwanted software.



Windows Defender Offline is a downloadable tool that can be used to create
a bootable CD, DVD, or USB flash drive to scan a computer for malware and
other threats. It does not offer real-time protection and is not a substitute
for an up-to-date antimalware solution.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 131

Glossary
For additional information about these and other terms, visit the MMPC glossary
at www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Glossary.aspx.
account credentials
Information presented to a service provider to verify that the holder of the
credentials is authorized to access an account. Account credentials typically take
the form of user names paired with passwords, but other forms of identification
are possible.
ActiveX control
A software component of Microsoft Windows that can be used to create and
distribute small applications through Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls can be
developed and used by software to perform functions that would otherwise not
be available using typical Internet Explorer capabilities. Because ActiveX controls
can be used to perform a wide variety of functions, including downloading and
running programs, vulnerabilities discovered in them may be exploited by
malware. In addition, cybercriminals may also develop their own ActiveX
controls, which can do damage to a computer if a user visits a webpage that
contains the malicious ActiveX control.
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
A security feature in recent versions of Windows that randomizes the memory
locations used by system files and other programs, which makes it harder for an
attacker to exploit the system by targeting specific memory locations.
air gap
The complete separation of a computer or network from others, with no wired
or wireless data connections. Data can only be exchanged across an air gap by
physically transporting removable media from one computer to another.
ASEP
See autostart extensibility point.
ASLR
See Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
autostart extensibility point (ASEP)
A place in the registry or file system that Windows checks for programs and
processes that should be automatically launched after boot. Threats often add
132 GLOSSARY

themselves to one or more ASEPs to ensure that they run automatically
whenever the computer is rebooted.
backdoor trojan
A type of trojan that provides attackers with remote unauthorized access to and
control of infected computers. Bots are a subcategory of backdoor trojans. Also
see botnet.
boleto
Short for boleto bancário. A popular payment method in Brazil, similar to an
invoice. Some threats steal money by altering boletos in web pages or email
messages.
botnet
A set of computers controlled by a “command-and-control” (C&C) computer to
execute commands as directed. The C&C computer can issue commands
directly (often through Internet Relay Chat [IRC]) or by using a decentralized
mechanism, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. Computers in a botnet are
often called bots, nodes, or zombies.
browser modifier
A program that changes browser settings, such as the home page, without
adequate consent. This also includes browser hijackers.
buffer overflow
An error in an application in which the data written into a buffer exceeds the
current capacity of that buffer, thus overwriting adjacent memory. Because
memory is overwritten, unreliable program behavior may result and, in certain
cases, allow arbitrary code to run.
C&C
Short for command and control. See botnet.
CCM
Short for computers cleaned per mille (thousand). The number of computers
cleaned for every 1,000 executions of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal
Tool (MSRT). For example, if the MSRT has 50,000 executions in a particular
location in the first quarter of the year and removes infections from 200
computers, the CCM for that location in the first quarter of the year is 4.0 (200 ÷
50,000 × 1,000). Also see encounter rate.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 133

clean
To remove malware or unwanted software from an infected computer. A single
cleaning can involve multiple disinfections.
command and control
See botnet.
credentials
See account credentials.
definition
See detection signature.
detection signature
A set of characteristics that can identify a malware family or variant. Signatures
are used by antimalware products to determine whether a file is malicious or
not. Also see definition.
detonation chamber
A sandbox environment in which potentially dangerous files can be
automatically launched and monitored for possible malicious activity.
disclosure
Revelation of the existence of a vulnerability to a third party.
disinfect
To remove a malware or potentially unwanted software component from a
computer or to restore functionality to an infected program. Compare with
clean.
double free vulnerability
A vulnerability triggered when code attempts to free the same memory address
twice. This can cause memory corruption, which an attacker may be able to take
advantage of if it is not handled properly.
downloader
See downloader/dropper.
downloader/dropper
A form of trojan that installs other malicious files to a computer that it has
infected, either by downloading them from a remote computer or by obtaining
them directly from a copy contained in its own code.

134 GLOSSARY

encounter
An instance of security software detecting a threat and blocking, quarantining,
or removing it from the computer.
encounter rate
The percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time security software that
report detecting malware or potentially unwanted software, or report detecting
a specific threat or family, during a period. Also see infection rate.
exploit
Malicious code that takes advantage of software vulnerabilities to infect a
computer or perform other harmful actions.

such as a single computer and the network server, or one server to another.
generic
A type of signature that is capable of detecting a variety of malware samples
from a specific family, or of a specific type.
hash
Text that has been encoded using a one-way cryptographic function that
prevents it from being decrypted. Also refers to a checksum produced by a hash
function to identify or authenticate data.
heuristics
A tool or technique that can help identify common patterns. This can be useful
for making generic detections for a malware family.
IFrame
Short for inline frame. An IFrame is an HTML document that is embedded in
another HTML document. Because the IFrame loads another webpage, it can be
used by criminals to place malicious content, such as a script that downloads
and installs spyware, into non-malicious HTML pages that are hosted by trusted
websites.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 135

in the wild

OSINT
See open source intelligence.
P2P
See peer-to-peer (P2P).
pass-the-hash (PtH)
An attack technique wherein the attacker gains access to a resource by
presenting a hashed credential directly for authentication, instead of presenting
the password normally and allowing the authentication system to create the
hash.
password stealer (PWS)
Malware that is specifically used to transmit personal information, such as user
names and passwords. A PWS often works in conjunction with a keylogger. Also
see monitoring tool.
payload

can include, but are not limited to, downloading files, changing system settings,
displaying messages, and logging keystrokes.
peer-to-peer (P2P)
A system of network communication in which individual nodes are able to
communicate with each other without the use of a central server.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 137

phishing
A method of credential theft that tricks Internet users into revealing personal or
financial information online. Phishers use phony websites or deceptive email
messages that mimic trusted businesses and brands to steal personally
identifiable information (PII), such as user names, passwords, credit card
numbers, and identification numbers.
phishing impression
A single instance of a user attempting to visit a known phishing page with
Internet Explorer versions 7 through 11, and being blocked by the Phishing Filter
or SmartScreen Filter. Also see malware impression.
ransomware
A type of malware that prevents use of a computer or access to the data that it
contains until the user pays a certain amount to a remote attacker (the
“ransom”). Computers that have ransomware installed usually display a screen
containing information on how to pay the “ransom.” A user cannot usually
access anything on the computer beyond the screen.
return-oriented programming (ROP)
An exploit technique that involves gaining control of a program's control flow
and calling a chain of instructions that already exist in memory, each of which
ends in a return command.
rogue security software
Software that appears to be beneficial from a security perspective but that
provides limited or no security capabilities, generates a significant number of
erroneous or misleading alerts, or attempts to socially engineer the user into
participating in a fraudulent transaction.
rooting
Obtaining administrative user rights on a mobile device through the use of
exploits. Device owners sometimes use such exploits intentionally to gain access
to additional functionality, but these exploits can also be used by attackers to
infect devices with malware that bypasses many typical security systems. The
term “rooting” is typically used in the context of Android devices; the
comparable process on iOS devices is more commonly referred to as
jailbreaking.
ROP
See return-oriented programming (ROP).

138 GLOSSARY

sandbox
A specially constructed portion of a computing environment in which potentially
dangerous programs or processes may run without causing harm to resources
outside the sandbox.
signature
See detection signature.
sinkhole
A server or set of servers designed to absorb and analyze malware traffic.
social engineering
A technique that defeats security precautions by exploiting human
vulnerabilities. Social engineering scams can be both online (such as receiving
email messages that ask the recipient to click the attachment, which is actually
malware) and offline (such as receiving a phone call from someone posing as a
representative from one’s credit card company). Regardless of the method
selected, the purpose of a social engineering attack remains the same—to get
the targeted user to perform an action of the attacker's choice.
software bundler
A program that installs unwanted software on a computer at the same time as
the software the user is trying to install, without adequate consent.
spam
Bulk unsolicited email. Malware authors may use spam to distribute malware,
either by attaching the malware to email messages or by sending a message
containing a link to the malware. Malware may also harvest email addresses for
spamming from compromised machines or may use compromised machines to
send spam.
spear phishing
Phishing that targets a specific person, organization, or group, containing
additional information associated with that person, organization, or group to
lure the target further into a false sense of security to divulge more sensitive
information.
SQL injection
A technique in which an attacker enters a specially crafted Structured Query
Language (SQL) statement into an ordinary web form. If form input is not
filtered and validated before being submitted to a database, the malicious SQL
statement may be executed, which could cause significant damage or data loss.

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015 139

targeted attack
A malware attack against a specific group of companies or individuals. This type
of attack usually aims to get access to the computer or network, before trying to
steal information or disrupt the infected machines.
tool
In the context of malware, a software program that may have legitimate
purposes but may also be used by malware authors or attackers.
trojan
A generally self-contained program that does not self-replicate but takes
malicious action on the computer.
unwanted software
A program with potentially unwanted functionality that is brought to the user’s
attention for review. This functionality may affect the user’s privacy, security, or
computing experience.
virus
Malware that replicates, typically by infecting other files in the computer, to
allow the execution of the malware code and its propagation when those files
are activated.
vulnerability
A weakness, error, or poor coding technique in a program that may allow an
attacker to exploit it for a malicious purpose.
wild
See in the wild.
worm
Malware that spreads by spontaneously sending copies of itself through email
or by using other communication mechanisms, such as instant messaging (IM)
or peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.
