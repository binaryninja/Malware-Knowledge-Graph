New Sandworm Malware Cyclops Blink Replaces
VPNFilter
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-054a

Summary
The Sandworm actor, which the United Kingdom and the United States have
previously attributed to the Russian GRU, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter
malware with a new more advanced framework.
The United Kingdom's (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the U.S. have identified that the actor known as Sandworm
or Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops Blink. The NCSC,
CISA, and the FBI have previously attributed the Sandworm actor to the Russian General
Staff Main Intelligence Directorate’s Russian (GRU’s) Main Centre for Special Technologies
(GTsST). The malicious cyber activity below has previously been attributed to Sandworm:
Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in
2018, and which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO)
routers and network attached storage (NAS) devices.
This advisory summarizes the VPNFilter malware it replaces, and provides more detail on
Cyclops Blink, as well as the associated tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by
Sandworm. An NCSC malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink is also available.
It also provides mitigation measures to help organizations defend against malware.

Technical Details
VPNFilter
The malware was first exposed in 2018

A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 2018 describes VPNFilter and its modules in
detail. VPNFilter was deployed in stages, with most functionality in the third-stage modules.
These modules enabled traffic manipulation, destruction of the infected host device, and
likely enabled downstream devices to be exploited. They also allowed monitoring of Modbus
SCADA protocols, which appears to be an ongoing requirement for Sandworm, as also seen
in their previous attacks against ICS networks.

1/8

VPNFilter targeting was widespread and appeared indiscriminate, with some exceptions:
Cisco Talos reported an increase of victims in Ukraine in May 2018. Sandworm also
deployed VPNFilter against targets in the Republic of Korea before the 2018 Winter
Olympics.
In May 2018, Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter and the U.S.
Department of Justice linked the activity to Sandworm and announced efforts to disrupt the
botnet.
Activity since its exposure

A Trendmicro blog in January 2021 detailed residual VPNFilter infections and provided data
which showed that although there had been a reduction in requests to a known C2 domain,
there was still more than a third of the original number of first-stage infections.
Sandworm has since shown limited interest in existing VPNFilter footholds, instead preferring
to retool.
Cyclops Blink
Active since 2019

The NCSC, CISA, the FBI, and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a
large-scale modular malware framework (T1129) which is targeting network devices. The
new malware is referred to here as Cyclops Blink and has been deployed since at least
June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with VPNFilter,
Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread.
The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices, but it is likely
that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other architectures and
firmware.
Note: Note that only WatchGuard devices that were reconfigured from the manufacturer
default settings to open remote management interfaces to external access could be infected
Malware overview

The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon
(T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded and
executed. There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is running, which
allows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required.
The NCSC has published a malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink which provides more
detail about the malware.
Post exploitation

2/8

Post exploitation, Cyclops Blink is generally deployed as part of a firmware ‘update’
(T1542.001). This achieves persistence when the device is rebooted and makes remediation
harder.
Victim devices are organized into clusters and each deployment of Cyclops Blink has a list of
command and control (C2) IP addresses and ports that it uses (T1008). All the known C2 IP
addresses to date have been used by compromised WatchGuard firewall devices.
Communications between Cyclops Blink clients and servers are protected under Transport
Layer Security (TLS) (T1071.001), using individually generated keys and certificates.
Sandworm manages Cyclops Blink by connecting to the C2 layer through the Tor network.

Mitigations
Cyclops Blink persists on reboot and throughout the legitimate firmware update process.
Affected organizations should therefore take steps to remove the malware.
WatchGuard has worked closely with the FBI, CISA, NSA and the NCSC, and has provided
tooling and guidance to enable detection and removal of Cyclops Blink on WatchGuard
devices through a non-standard upgrade process. Device owners should follow each step in
these instructions to ensure that devices are patched to the latest version and that any
infection is removed.
3/8

The tooling and guidance from WatchGuard can be found
at: https://detection.watchguard.com/.
In addition:
If your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, you should assume that any
passwords present on the device have been compromised and replace them (see
NCSC password guidance for organizations.
You should ensure that the management interface of network devices is not exposed to
the internet.

Indicators of Compromise
Please refer to the accompanying Cyclops Blink malware analysis report for indicators of
compromise which may help detect this activity.

A Cyclops Blink infection does not mean that an organization is the primary target, but it may
be selected to be, or its machines could be used to conduct attacks.
Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory to defend against
this activity, and to refer to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink
malware analysis report to detect possible activity on networks.
UK organizations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected
compromises to the NCSC at https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/.

Further Guidance
A variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the malware featured in this
advisory:
Do not expose management interfaces of network devices to the internet: the
management interface is a significant attack surface, so not exposing them reduces the
risk. See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/acquiring-managing-anddisposing-network-devices.
Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the latest
supported versions, apply security patches promptly, use anti-virus and scan regularly
to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware.

6/8

Use multi-factor authentication to reduce the impact of password compromises.
See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authenticationonline-services and https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication2fa.
Treat people as your first line of defense. Tell staff how to report suspected phishing
emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports promptly and
thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening attachments. See
NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing.
Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be
needed to analyze network intrusions. See NCSC Guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes.
Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organization’s networks. See NCSC
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement.
