malware.]
More than half of all web servers on the Internet use Apache, so when we discovered a
malicious Apache module in the wild last month, being used to inject malicious content into
web pages displayed by compromised web servers, we were understandably concerned.
Our concern deepened when we discovered that this malware was being used in a scheme
to steal banking credentials.

At first, we wondered if this code might be related to the Linux/Snasko.A rootkit reported to
the Full-Disclosure mailing list and then analyzed by CrowdStrike and Kaspersky but it turns
out this is a completely different beast.
The malicious
Apache module we
have analyzed is
detected by ESET
as Linux/Chapro.A.
the primary
purpose of which is
to inject malicious
content into web
pages served up by
the compromised
server (as
diagrammed on the
right where an
iframe is injected,
but it could be
malicious
JavaScript or
something else).
Although the module can serve any type of content, in this specific case the final payload,
achieved via the iframe injection, was installation of a variant of Win32/Zbot, which is
commonly used to steal banking information from infected systems.
We also found that this module has a couple of interesting capabilities designed to reduce
its chances of being spotted by system administrators. In addition to analyzing the malicious
Apache module, we were able to analyze the malicious content it was serving.
In this analysis, we will present the characteristics of Linux/Chapro.A. We will also give an
overview of the exploit kit used to install malware, and the final Win32/Zbot payload.

Linux/Chapro.A Characteristics
The Linux/Chapro.A malicious Apache module is an x64 Linux binary. This malware makes
use of only one obfuscation technique. It uses an XOR loop with a 12 byte long key to
encode most of the strings.
The program has many capabilities to evade detection by system administrators. Before
serving malicious content to a visitor, multiple checks will be performed.

2/8

First, Linux/Chapro.A checks the web browser’s user agent for known bots as well as web
browsers that are not likely to be vulnerable to the exploits used to infect the target system.
If the web browser visiting the page has a user agent string that contains keywords known
to be used by web crawlers, the malware will not be served the malicious content. The
following figure shows some of the keywords used by the bot.

Linux/Chapro.A will also inspect all active SSH sessions on the Linux system on which it is
running to determine the IP addresses being used by them. If a visitor browses a page
using any of the same IPs involved in a SSH connection, it will not be served the malicious
content. This helps hide the malicious content from system administrators, web developers
and others who might be working on the web server
Before injecting the malicious iframe into the web content sent by the server,
Linux/Chapro.A sets a cookie in the visiting web browser. Malicious content will not be
served if the visiting browser already had that cookie set. This helps ensure that visitors will

not receive malicious content over and over again, making it more difficult to determine how
a system was infected.
Finally, Linux/Chapro.A maintains a list of IP addresses that have been served malicious
content. If a user visits an infected website twice from the same IP address; it will only
receive the malicious content once. This provides a second, additional method to make the
path of infection more difficult to determine.

Injected Content
The main purpose of Linux/Chapro.A is to inject iframes into webpages served by the
Apache webserver to which it is attached. To do so, the malware sends an HTTP POST
request to its command and control server every 10 minutes. The following figure shows
one such HTTP POST request.

At the time of our analysis, the malicious command and control server was being hosted in
Germany. It has recently gone offline.
The request is simple; it only includes the version of the malware and the operating system
it is running on. The command and control server will respond to the query with the iframe
to be injected by the malicious apache module. The iframe is encoded using base64 and
XOR. If a visitor does not fall into any of the blacklists detailed in the previous section, it is
served the iframe downloaded from the command and control server.
The figure below shows the HTML code for an iframe sent by Linux/Chapro.A. The iframe is
positioned outside of the usual browser display area in order to avoid being seen by the
user.

Exploit Kit
Based on our analysis and descriptions from this article, we are confident the iframe
injected by Linux/Chapro.A points to a “Sweet Orange” exploit pack landing page. At the
time of our analysis, the exploit pack was being hosted in Lithuania. The pack tries to
exploit the following vulnerabilities found in modern web browsers and plugins:
CVE-2012-5076: Java JAX-WS Class Handling
CVE-2012-4681: Java getField Method Class Invocation Privilege Escalation
CVE-2006-0003: Internet Explorer MDAC
CVE-2010-0188: Adobe Reader LibTiff Integer Overflow
If the exploit pack is able to exploit one of the vulnerabilities it has exploits for, the final
payload is executed.

Attack Payload
The final purpose of the attack we have investigated is to install a variant of Win32/Zbot,
also known as ZeuS, which has been widely used for years to steal banking-related
information. In this case, the Win32/Zbot variant targets European and Russian banking
institutions. The screenshot below shows a form used by a bank to give customers online
access to account information.

5/8

Apparently this bank is aware that it has been targeted by criminals attempting to obtain
customer PIN code and CVC/CVV code information. Indeed, a specific warning is shown on
its customer login form. However, when the login page is visited from a compromised host,
this warning is removed by the malware, as you can see below.

6/8

Once the user has logged into his account, the malware will inject a pop-up asking for the
CVV code for his card, which is exactly the behavior outlined in the warning on the original
login form. The malware will then try to send the user credentials, along with the CVV, to the
botnet operator.

Conclusions
The Linux/Chapro.A attack has not been publicly documented in the past. Our telemetry
systems did not report other installation of this malicious Apache module in the wild. While
the intent of injecting iframes into served webpages is the same as the rootkit analyzed by
Crowdstrike and Kaspersky, we confirm this is not the same malware family. On the other
hand, this malware has many similarities to something discussed on Russian underground
forums as exposed by Dancho Danchev.
While we have not witnessed any other installations of Linux/Chapro.A in the wild, we have
observed thousands of users accessing the Sweet Orange exploit pack before we blocked
access to this server in our products. ESET blocked the exploit attempts through generic
detection, even before additional protection was added with URL blocking.
The attack described in the present analysis shows the increased complexity of malware
attacks. This complicated case spreads across three different countries, targeting users
from a fourth one, making it very hard for law enforcement agencies to investigate and
mitigate. It is not clear at this point in time if the same group of people are behind the whole
operation, or if multiple gangs collaborated, perhaps with one to drive traffic to the exploit
pack and sell the infected computers to another gang operating a botnet based on
Win32/Zbot.
