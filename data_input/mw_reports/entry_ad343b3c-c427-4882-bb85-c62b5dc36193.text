A Wicked Family of Bots

As we continue to keep track of the latest IoT botnets, the FortiGuard Labs team has seen
an increasing number of Mirai variants, thanks to the source code being made public two
years ago. Since then, threat actors have been adding their own flavours to the original
recipe.
Some made significant modifications, such as adding the capability to turn infected devices
into swarms of malware proxies and cryptominers. Others integrated Mirai code with multiple
exploits targeting both known and unknown vulnerabilities, similar to a new variant recently
discovered by FortiGuard Labs, which we now call WICKED.
This new variant has added at least three exploits to its arsenal to target unpatched IoT
devices. In this article, we will take a look at how it works, the primary purpose of this bot,
and how it relates to other known botnets.

Inside the Bot

1/4

To provide an immediate overview on the differences between Mirai and this new variant, we
need to take a look at its configuration table, which can be decrypted by XOR with the key
0x37.
Some of the more interesting strings we noticed include /bin/busybox WICKED and
WICKED: applet not found, where we got the name for this variant. Moreover, the string
SoraLOADER might be taken as a clue that this bot functions as a downloader and spreader
for the Sora botnet, a Mirai variant. However, as we went through our analysis, this was later
contradicted, which then led us to a more interesting hypothesis.
Fig 1. Decrypted configuration table
Botnets based on Mirai usually contain three main modules: Attack, Killer, and Scanner. In
this analysis, we will just focus on the Scanner module that includes the spreading
mechanism of the botnet. The original Mirai used traditional brute force attempts to gain
access to IOT devices. The WICKED bot, on the other hand, uses known and available
exploits, with many of them already being quite old.
Wicked bot scans port 8080, 8443, 80, and 81 by initiating a raw socket SYN connection.
Fig 2. Socket file descriptor
If a connection is established, it will attempt to exploit the device and download its payload. It
does this by writing the exploit strings to the socket using the write() syscall. Write() syscall is
the same as calling send() syscall with the flags argument set to zero (which means no extra
behaviors.)

Devices Targeted by Wicked
The exploit to be used depends on the specific port the bot was able to connect to. Exploits
and the corresponding target ports are listed below.
Port 8080: Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers (also used by Reaper botnet)

Port 81: CCTV-DVR Remote Code Execution

Port 8443: Netgear R7000 and R6400 Command Injection (CVE-2016-6277)

Port 80: Invoker shell in compromised web servers
The next item on the list does not directly exploit the device, but instead takes advantage of
compromised web servers with malicious web shells already installed.
Fig 7. Invoke shell
After a successful exploit, this bot then downloads its payload from a malicious web site, in
this case, hxxp://185.246.152.173/exploit/owari.{extension}. This makes it obvious that it
aims to download the Owari bot, another Mirai variant, instead of the previously hinted at
Sora bot. However, at the time of analysis, the Owari bot samples could no longer be found
in the website directory. In another turn of events, it turns out that they have been replaced
by the samples shown below, which were later found to be the Omni bot.
Fig 8. Exploit repository of Omni botnet
We double checked the history of the malicious website and confirmed that it had previously
delivered the Owari botnet.
Fuzzing the website’s /bins directory, we found other Omni samples in the directory, which
were reported to be delivered using the GPON vulnerability (CVE-2018-10561). Payloads
are regularly updated, as shown by its timestamp.

Connecting the Dots
Finding the connection between the Wicked, Sora, Owari ,and Omni botnets led us to an
interview last April with a security researcher who we believe to be the author of these botnet
variants. Basically, the author using pseudo name “Wicked” confirmed he is the author of
both Sora and Owari. When asked about the future of Sora and Owari, Wicked’s response
was “SORA is an abandoned project for now and I will continue to work on OWARI. You will
not see a third project from me anytime soon as I continue to expand my current ones.”
Apparently, as seen in the /bins repository, Sora and Owari botnet samples have now both
been abandoned and replaced with Omni.

Conclusion
Based on the author’s statements in the above-mentioned interview as to the different
botnets being hosted in the same host, we can essentially confirm that the author of the
botnets Wicked, Sora, Owari, and Omni are one and the same. This also leads us to the
conclusion that while the WICKED bot was originally meant to deliver the Sora botnet, it was
later repurposed to serve the author’s succeeding projects.

FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor the latest developments in the IoT threat landscape,
specifically following botnets as they add new exploits to their arsenal in order to infect IoT
devices.
