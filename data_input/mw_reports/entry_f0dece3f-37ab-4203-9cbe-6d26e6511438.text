US government officials announced today the disruption of the Cyclops Blink botnet
controlled by the Russian-backed Sandworm hacking group before being used in attacks.
The malware, used by Sandworm to create this botnet since at least June 2019, is targeting
WatchGuard Firebox firewall appliances and multiple ASUS router models.
Cyclops Blink enables the attackers to establish persistence on the device through firmware
updates, providing remote access to compromised networks.
This malware is modular, making it easy to upgrade to target new devices and tap into new
pools of exploitable hardware.

"We are announcing today [..] the disruption of a global botnet controlled by the Russian
military intelligence agency, commonly known as the GRU," US Attorney General Merrick
Garland said.
"The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets.
Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used.
"Thanks to our close work with international partners we were able to detect the infection of
thousands of network hardware devices. We were then able to disable the GRU's control
over those devices before the botnet could be weaponized."

Malware removed from infected Watchguard and Asus devices
Following this US Justice Department operation's initial March 18 court authorization, the
malware was removed from all remaining identified Watchguard devices acting as command
and control servers.
The FBI has also notified owners of compromised devices in the United States and abroad
through foreign law enforcement partners before removing the Cyclops Blink malware. US
victims whose contact info was not found were contacted by their providers following notices
issued by the FBI.
FBI Director Chris Wray said the botnet was disrupted following close cooperation with
Watchguard while analyzing the malware and developing detection tools and remediation
techniques.

"I should caution that as we move forward, any Firebox devices that acted as bots, may still
remain vulnerable in the future until mitigated by their owners. So those owners should still
go ahead and adopt Watchguard's detection and remediation steps as soon as possible,"
FBI Director Chris Wray added.
"Sandworm strung them together to use their computing power in a way that would obfuscate
who was really running the network and let them launch malware or to orchestrate distributed
denial of service attacks, like the GRU has already used to attack Ukraine."
WatchGuard has shared detailed instructions on how to restore compromised
Firebox appliances to a clean state to remediate the infection and update them to the latest
Fireware OS version to prevent future infections.
WatchGuard played an important role in eliminating the threat posed by Cyclops Blink,
with the rapid release of detection and remediation tools to protect its partners and
customers following the government disclosure of the malware, and by cooperating
with the U. S. Department of Justice in its effort to disrupt the botnet. The company’s
close collaboration with its partner and customer communities was instrumental in
mitigating this sophisticated state-sponsored threat, which affected less than 1% of
WatchGuard appliances. — WatchGuard spokesperson

The Sandworm Russian-backed threat group
Sandworm (also tracked as Voodoo Bear, BlackEnergy, and TeleBots), the group behind the
Cyclops Blink botnet, is a Russian-sponsored hacking group active since the mid-2000s.
Its operators are believed to be Russian military hackers part of Unit 74455 of the Russian
GRU's Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST).
Sandworm was linked to the BlackEnergy malware behind blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and
2016 [1, 2, 3], the KillDisk wiper attacks against Ukrainian banks, and highly
destructive NotPetya ransomware used to inflict billions worth of damage to companies
worldwide starting with June 2017.
"Sandworm is the premier Russian cyber attack capability and one of the actors we have
been most concerned about in light of the invasion," John Hultquist, Mandiant VP of
Intelligence Analysis, told BleepingComputer.
"We are concerned that they could be used to hit targets in Ukraine, but we are also
concerned they may hit targets in the West in retribution for the pressure being placed on
Russia."
