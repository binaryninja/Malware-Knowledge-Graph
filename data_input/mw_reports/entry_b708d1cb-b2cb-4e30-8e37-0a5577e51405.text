Distributed in 2019 using SMiShing and enhanced anti-researcher
techniques
Kaspersky has continued to track the Roaming Mantis campaign. The group’s attack
methods have improved and new targets continuously added in order to steal more funds.
The attackers’ focus has also shifted to techniques that avoid tracking and research: allowlist
for distribution, analysis environment detection and so on. We’ve also observed new
malware families: Fakecop (also known as SpyAgent by McAfee) and Wroba.j (also known
as Funkybot by Fortinet).

Distribution of Wroba.g via SMiShing with impersonated brands
In 2018, the group added a distribution method for Wroba.g (aliases: Moqhao and XLoader),
in addition to the original method of DNS hijacking. It was SMiShing using a spoofed delivery
notice from a logistics company. In 2019, we confirmed another new method where a
1/9

downloaded malicious APK file has an icon that impersonates a major courier company
brand. The spoofed brand icon is customized for the country it targets, for example, Sagawa
Express for Japan; Yamato Transport and FedEx for Taiwan; CJ Logistics for South Korea
and Econt Express for Russia.

Examples of SMiShing with Android malware icons impersonating brands

In February 2020, the attacker modified a SMiShing message from a spoofed absence
notification to “delivering free masks for the coronavirus issue” in Japan, according to a
warning by Japan Cybercrime Control Center (JC3). This once again shows that criminals
always make use of hot topics in their activities.

Allowlist feature of Wroba.g landing page for Korea only
The Roaming Mantis actor also employed a new feature in their Wroba.g landing page –
currently only on the Korean page. It’s a allowlist feature to evade security researchers.
When a user visits the landing page, they have to enter their phone number for confirmation.
If the phone number is on the allowlist, the landing page distributes a malicious app.apk:

The fake CJ Logistics landing page includes an allowlist

The actor has a habit of trying out their new methods in Korean first. It means the method
described above may be applied later on landing pages in other languages as well. If that
happens, it would make it almost impossible for researchers to obtain a sample, because it
would require a specific phone number in the actor’s allowlist database.

Multidex obfuscation trick in a loader module of Wroba.g
A single Dalvik Executable (DEX) has a 64K reference limit. As a workaround, a
configuration of Mutidex allows the application to build and read multiple DEX files. In 2019,
the actor used Multidex in an APK file to hide a malicious loader module as an obfuscation
trick. Our analysis shows that it has been modified little by little:

Transition of obfuscation using Multidex

The classes${num}.dex marked with a red square is the actual malicious loader module. All
the other DEX files are simply junk code. However, the encrypted payload of Wroba.g is still
under the assets directory and can be decrypted by the simple python script described in our
previous blogpost.

Wroba.g is targeting carrier billing and online banks in Japan
The actor has a strong financial motivation. They are targeting carrier billing and online bank
accounts. They have implemented redirection to phishing sites to steal credentials in the
decrypted payload of Wroba.g:

Hardcoded pkg name, URL of pinterest.com and pop-up message

4/9

When the malware detects a specific package of a Japanese online bank or specific mobile
carriers on the infected device, it connects in the background to a hardcoded malicious
account of pinterest.com to fetch a phishing site with an alert message. The message claims
that it has blocked unauthorized access from a third party and asks the user to click on a
button to confirm they want to proceed. If the user clicks the button, they will be redirected to
a phishing site:

The targeted packages for online banks and mobile carriers correspond to the relevant
accounts on pinterest.com that lead to phishing sites:

As can be seen in the table above, all the accounts have corresponding phishing sites as of
December 2019 (data provided by @ninoseki on Twitter). These destination URLs are
continuously changed by the attackers. In January 2020, only three of these accounts were
enabled for some reason. However, as it’s easy for the criminals to modify the phishing page
address, apps without corresponding phishing sites are also likely to be attacked again in the
near future.

Wroba.j and Fakecop discovered in 2019
Roaming Mantis has been using Wroba.g and Wroba.f as its main Android malware. In April
2019, we observed two more malware families, Wroba.j and Fakecop. These two malware
families have some similarities with the other families in terms of infrastructure, distribution
channel, etc. We have created some slides, Roaming Mantis: A melting pot of Android bots
in Botconf2019, showing the timeline, impersonated brands, malware features and money
laundering method.
Based on our telemetry data, detection rates of both malicious programs were very low. We
believe that this was a test by the attacker. However, the most alarming thing we discovered
was the following SMS spamming function in Wroba.j:

6/9

Generating feedback for SMS spamming results

The function automatically creates a sophisticated list of phone numbers from the feedback
for SMS spamming results. This malware also has another function that checks the
International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) to identify mobile carriers in Japan and add
the phone number to a relevant spamming list.

Checking the IMSI of mobile carrier Docomo

According to the hardcoded IMSIs and strings shown below, the attacker seems to be
targeting Docomo and Softbank mobile carriers.

Conclusion
The Roaming Mantis actor is strongly motivated by financial gain and is eager to evade
tracking by researchers. It is now employing yet another method – allowlisting – to achieve
this. This new method is currently only being applied for Korean pages, but it’s only a matter
of time before it’s implemented for other languages.
The actor is still very active in using SMiShing for Android malware distribution. This is
particularly alarming, because it means all infected mobile devices could form a botnet for
malware delivery, SMiShing, and so on. ISPs, together with security companies, need to
keep a close eye on the Roaming Mantis campaign to understand how to combat it.
