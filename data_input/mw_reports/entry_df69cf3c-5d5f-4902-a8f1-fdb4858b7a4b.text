FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at a December 20, 2018 press conference at the
Department of Justice announcing charges against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, both
Chinese nationals and members of the APT 10 hacking group, as Deputy Attorney General
Rod J. Rosenstein looks on.
Two Chinese men have been charged in a massive, years-long hacking campaign that stole
personal and proprietary information from companies around the world, the FBI and the
Justice Department announced at a press conference today in Washington, D.C.
The men, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, are part of a group known as Advanced Persistent
Threat 10, or APT 10, a hacking group associated with the Chinese government. A New
York grand jury indicted the pair for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, conspiracy to
commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The indictment was unsealed today.

According to the indictment, from around 2006 to 2018, APT 10 conducted extensive
hacking campaigns, stealing information from more than 45 victim organizations, including
American companies. Hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data were secretly taken from
companies in a diverse range of industries, such as health care, biotechnology, finance,
manufacturing, and oil and gas.

FBI Director Christopher Wray described the list of companies, not named in the indictment,
as a “Who’s Who” of the global economy. Even government agencies like NASA and the
Department of Energy were among the victims. The hack is part of China’s ongoing efforts
to steal intellectual property from other countries.
“Healthy competition is good for the global economy. Criminal conduct is not. Rampant theft
is not. Cheating is not,” Wray said at the press conference.
APT 10 used “spear phishing” techniques to introduce malware onto targeted computers.
The hackers sent emails that appeared to be from legitimate addresses but contained
attachments that installed a program to secretly record all keystrokes on the machine,
including user names and passwords. The group also targeted managed service providers
(MSPs), companies that remotely manage their clients’ servers and networks. MSP hacks
allowed APT 10 members to indirectly gain access to confidential data of numerous
companies who were the clients of the MSPs.

“China’s state-sponsored actors are the most active
perpetrators of state-sponsored espionage against us.”

“When hackers gain access to MSPs, they can steal sensitive business information that
gives competitors an unfair advantage,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein
during today’s announcement.
APT 10 also accessed the personal information of more than 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel.
In remarks announcing the indictments, Wray noted that FBI and Department of Defense
investigators worked together to analyze hundreds of malware samples. Investigators found
links between victims and APT 10. The FBI’s Cyber Action Team, in collaboration with the
Department of Homeland Security, also provided technical assistance and investigated the
incidents.
Although the two indicted hackers are believed to be in China, they can be arrested if they
travel.
This indictment is the latest in a series of charges against international hackers who target
the United States and its allies. In October, seven Russian government operatives were
charged with hacking into international anti-doping agencies. Last month, two Iranians were
charged with using ransomware to infiltrate critical networks in the United States and
Canada.
The cyber espionage threat from China is the most pervasive, Wray stressed.

“China’s goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower, and
they’re using illegal methods to get there. They’re using an expanding set of non-traditional
and illegal methods,” Wray said. “China’s state-sponsored actors are the most active
perpetrators of state-sponsored espionage against us.”
