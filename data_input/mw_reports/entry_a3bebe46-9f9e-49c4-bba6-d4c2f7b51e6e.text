April 25, 2018

McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts have uncovered a global data reconnaissance
campaign assaulting a wide number of industries including critical infrastructure,
entertainment, finance, health care, and telecommunications. This campaign, dubbed
Operation GhostSecret, leverages multiple implants, tools, and malware variants associated
with the state-sponsored cyber group Hidden Cobra. The infrastructure currently remains
active. In this post, we dive deeply into this campaign. For a brief overview of this threat, see
“Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from Critical Infrastructure, Entertainment, Finance,
Health Care, and Other Industries.”
Our investigation into this campaign reveals that the actor used multiple malware implants,
including an unknown implant with capabilities similar to Bankshot. From March 18 to 26 we
observed the malware operating in multiple areas of the world. This new variant resembles
parts of the Destover malware, which was used in the 2014 Sony Pictures attack.
Furthermore, the Advanced Threat Research team has discovered Proxysvc, which appears
to be an undocumented implant. We have also uncovered additional control servers that are
still active and associated with these new implants. Based on our analysis of public and
private information from submissions, along with product telemetry, it appears Proxysvc was
used alongside the 2017 Destover variant and has operated undetected since mid-2017.
The attackers behind Operation GhostSecret used a similar infrastructure to earlier threats,
including SSL certificates used by FakeTLS in implants found in the Destover backdoor
variant known as Escad, which was used in the Sony Pictures attack. Based on our technical
analysis, telemetry, and data from submissions, we can assert with high confidence that this
is the work of the Hidden Cobra group. The Advanced Threat Research team uncovered
activity related to this campaign in March 2018, when the actors targeted Turkish banks.
These initial findings appear to be the first stage of Operation GhostSecret. For more on the
global aspect of this threat, see “Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from Critical
Infrastructure of Entertainment, Finance, Health Care, and Other Industries.”

Analysis
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered a previously unknown datagathering implant that surfaced in mid-February 2018. This implant appears to be a
derivative of implants authored before by Hidden Cobra and contains functionality similar to
that of Bankshot, with code overlaps from other Hidden Cobra implants. However, the variant
1/25

is not based on Bankshot. Our analysis of the portable executable’s rich-header data reveals
that the two implants were compiled in different development environments. (The PE rich
header is an undocumented part of a Windows executable that reveals unique information to
identify the Microsoft compiler and linker used to create the program. It is helpful for
identifying similarities between malware variants to establish common development
environments.) Our analysis of the code and PE rich header indicates that Bankshot,
Proxysvc, and the Destover-like implant are distinct families, but also contain overlapping
code and functionality with current tools of Hidden Cobra.

When we compared the PE rich header data of the new February 2018 implant with a variant
of Backdoor.Escad (Destover) from 2014 shortly before the Sony Pictures attack, we found
the signatures to be identical. The Destover-like variant is 83% similar in code to a 2015
variant and contains the same rich PE header signature as the Backdoor.Escad variant we
analyzed. Thus the new implant is likely a derivative of components of Destover. We
2/25

determined that the implant is not a direct copy of well-known previous samples of Destover;
rather, Hidden Cobra created a new hybrid variant using functionality present in earlier
versions.

2014 Backdoor.Escad (hash: 8a7621dba2e88e32c02fe0889d2796a0c7cb5144).

2015 Destover variant (7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6).
The February implant fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c was obtained from an
unknown submitter in the United States on February 14, two days after it was compiled. This
Korean-language file used the control server IP address 203.131.222.83. The implant is
nearly identical to an unknown 2017 sample
(8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) except that the control server addresses
are different. The 2017 sample used address 14.140.116.172. Both implants specifically use
FakeTLS with PolarSSL, which we saw in previous Hidden Cobra implants. PolarSSL
libraries have appeared in implants since the Sony Pictures incident and were used
exclusively in the implant Backdoor.Destover. This implant incorporated a custom control
server protocol that sends traffic over port 443. The implementation does not format the
packets in standard SSL, but rather in a custom format and transmitted over SSL—hence,
FakeTLS. The control server traffic when compared to Backdoor.Escad is nearly identical.

Further research into IP address 14.140.116.172 leads us to additional hidden components
involved in the overall infrastructure. Proxysvc.dll contains a list of hardcoded IP addresses,
including the preceding address, all located in India. Despite the name, this component is not
an SSL proxy, but rather a unique data-gathering and implant-installation component that
listens on port 443 for inbound control server connections.
Proxysvc was first collected by public and private sources on March 22 from an unknown
entity in the United States. The executable dropper for the component was submitted from
South Korea on March 19. McAfee telemetry analysis from March 16 to 21 reveals that
Proxysvc components were active in the wild. Our research shows this listener component
appeared mostly in higher education organizations. We suspect this component is involved
in core control server infrastructure. These targets were chosen intentionally to run Proxysvc
because the attacker would have needed to know which systems were infected to connect to
4/25

them. This data also indicates this infrastructure had been operating for more than a year
before its discovery. The Advanced Threat Research team found this component running on
systems in 11 countries. Given the limited capabilities of Proxysvc, it appears to be part of a
covert network of SSL listeners that allow the attackers to gather data and install more
complex implants or additional infrastructure. The SSL listener supports multiple control
server connections, rather than a list of hardcoded addresses. By removing the dependency
on hardcoded IP addresses and accepting only inbound connections, the control service can
remain unknown.

Control Servers
Further investigation into the control server infrastructure reveals the SSL certificate
d0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76, which is tied to the control server
203.131.222.83, used by the February 2018 implant. This server resides at Thammasat
University in Bangkok, Thailand. The same entity hosted the control server for the Sony
Pictures implants. This SSL certificate has been used in Hidden Cobra operations since the
Sony Pictures attack. Analyzing this certificate reveals additional control servers using the
same PolarSSL certificate. Further analysis of McAfee telemetry data reveals several IP
addresses that are active, two within the same network block as the 2018 Destover-like
implant.

Implant Origins
McAfee Advanced Threat Research determined that the Destover-like variant originated from
code developed in 2015. The code reappeared in variants surfacing in 2017 and 2018 using
nearly the same functionality and with some modifications to commands, along with an
identical development environment based on the rich PE header information.
Both implants (fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c and
8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) are based on the 2015 code. When
comparing the implant 7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6, compiled on
August 8, 2015, we found it 83% similar to the implant from 2018. The key similarities and
differences follow.

Similarities
Both variants build their API imports dynamically using GetProcAddress, including
wtsapi32.dll for gathering user and domain names for any active remote sessions
Both variants contain a variety of functionalities based on command IDs issued by the
control servers

7/25

Common capabilities of both malware:
Listing files in directory
Creating arbitrary processes
Writing data received from control servers to files on disk
Gathering information for all drives
Gathering process times for all processes
Sending the contents of a specific file to the control server
Wiping and deleting files on disk
Setting the current working directory for the implant
Sending disk space information to the control server
Both variants use a batch file mechanism to delete their binaries from the system
Both variants run commands on the system, log output to a temporary file, and send
the contents of the file to their control servers

Differences
The following capabilities in the 2015 implant are missing from the 2018 variant:
Creating a process as a specific user
Terminating a specific process
Deleting a specific file
Setting file times for a specific file
Getting current system time and sending it to the control server
Reading the contents of a file on disk. If the filepath specified is a directory, then listing
the directory’s contents.
Setting attributes on files
The 2015 implant does not contain a hardcoded value of the IP address it must connect to.
Instead it contains a hardcoded sockaddr_in data structure (positioned at 0x270 bytes before
the end of the binary) used by the connect() API to specify port 443 and control server IP
addresses:
193.248.247.59
196.4.67.45
Both of these control servers used the PolarSSL certificate
d0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76.

Proxysvc
At first glance Proxysvc, the SSL listener, looks like a proxy setup tool (to carry out man-inthe-middle traffic interception). However, a closer analysis of the sample reveals it is yet
another implant using HTTP over SSL to receive commands from the control server.

8/25

Proxysvc appears to be a downloader whose primary capability is to deliver additional
payloads to the endpoint without divulging the control address of the attackers. This implant
contains a limited set of capabilities for reconnaissance and subsequent payload
installations. This implant is a service DLL that can also run as a standalone process.

The ServiceMain() sub function of Proxysvc.
The implant cannot connect to a control server IP address or URL. Instead it accepts
commands from the control server. The implant binds and listens to port 443 for any
incoming connections.

Proxysvc begins accepting incoming requests to process.
Proxysvc makes an interesting check while accepting connections from a potential control
server. It checks against a list of IP addresses to make sure the incoming connection is not
from any of the following addresses. If the incoming request does come from one of these,
the implant offers a zero response (ASCII “0”) and shuts down the connection.

SSL Listener Capabilities
The implant receives HTTP-based commands from a control server and parses the HTTP
Content-Type and Content-Length from the HTTP header. If the HTTP Content-Type
matches the following value, then the implant executes the command specified by the control
10/25

server:
Content-Type: 8U7y3Ju387mVp49A

HTTP Content-Type comparison with a custom implant value.
The implant has the following capabilities:
Writing an executable received from the control server into a temp file and executing it

Proxysvc writing a binary to a temp directory and executing it.

11/25

Gathering system information and sending it to the control server. The system
information gathered from the endpoint includes:
MAC address of the endpoint
Computer Name
Product name from HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
ProductName
This information is concatenated into a single string in the format:
“MAC_Address|ComputerName|ProductName” and is sent to the control server
Recording HTTP requests from the control server to the temporary file prx in the
implant’s install directory with the current system timestamp

Analyzing the Main Implant
The February 2018 implant contains a wide variety of capabilities including data exfiltration
and arbitrary command execution on the victim’s system. Given the extensive command
structure that the implant can receive from the control server, this is an extensive framework
for data reconnaissance and exfiltration, and indicates advanced use. For example, the
implant can wipe and delete files, execute additional implants, read data out of files, etc.
The implant begins execution by dynamically loading APIs to perform malicious activities.
Libraries used to load the APIs include:
Kernel32.dll
Apvapi32.dll
Oleaut32.dll
Iphlpapi.dll
Ws2_32.dll
Wtsapi32.dll
Userenv.dll
Ntdll.dll

12/25

The main implant dynamically loading APIs.
As part of its initialization, the implant gathers basic system information and sends it to its
hardcoded control server 203.131.222.83 using SSL over port 443:
Country name from system’s locale
Operating system version
Processor description from
HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0 ProcessorNameString

13/25

Computer name and network adapters information
Disk space information for disks C: through Z: including total memory in bytes, total
available memory in bytes, etc.
Current memory status including total physical memory in bytes, total available
memory, etc.
Domain name and usernames based on current remote sessions

Domain name and username extraction using Win32 WTS APIs.

Data Reconnaissance
The implant receives commands over SSL as encoded data. This data is decoded, and the
correct command ID is derived. Valid command IDs reside between 0 and 0x1D.

Switch case handling command execution based on command IDs.
Based on the command ID, the implant can perform the following functions:
Gather system information and exfiltrate to the control server (same as the basic datagathering functionality previously described)
Get volume information for all drives on the system (A: through Z:) and exfiltrate to the
control server

Conclusion

23/25

This analysis by the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has found previously
undiscovered components that we attribute to Hidden Cobra, which continues to target
organizations around the world. The evolution in complexity of these data-gathering implants
reveals an advanced capability by an attacker that continues its development of tools. Our
investigation uncovered an unknown infrastructure connected to recent operations with
servers in India using an advanced implant to establish a covert network to gather data and
launch further attacks.
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team will provide further updates as our
investigation develops.
Fighting cybercrime is a global effort best undertaken through effective partnerships between
the public and private sectors. McAfee is working with Thai government authorities to take
down the control server infrastructure of Operation GhostSecret, while preserving the
systems involved for further analysis by law enforcement authorities. By creating and
maintaining partnerships with worldwide law enforcement, McAfee demonstrates that we are
stronger together.
