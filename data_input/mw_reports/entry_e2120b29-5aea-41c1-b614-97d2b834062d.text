EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In the face of growing cybercrime, there are few deterrents more effective than hitting
attackers where it hurts most—in their own wallets. The more organizations invest in
securing their networks and training their staff on how to safely navigate the digital
workplace, the harder and more expensive it becomes for threat actors to disrupt or
breach networks.
But reducing any return on cybercriminals’ own investments or cutting into their profits,
is only effective if they maintain the status quo—and many do not. Far from being
overwhelmed by hardening environments, threat actors are proving their confidence as
chameleons. As threat actors face effective defenses to tried and tested attack vectors,
they adapt and switch to try out new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). And
this adaptation is proving successful. In particular, we are seeing the emergence of
new cybercrime operating models among high-profile threat groups. Relationships are
forming among “secure syndicates” that closely collaborate and use the same tools—
suggesting a major a change in how threat actors work together in the underground
economy, which will make attribution even more difficult.
The Accenture Security iDefense Threat Intelligence Services team has observed a
distinct and dangerous shift in threat actor TTPs during the past 12 months. Threat
actors are pivoting their operations strategically, operationally and tactically—and in
doing so they are testing the resilience of organizations who are doing their best to
keep up. Let’s take a look at these changes in more detail.
From a strategic perspective, Accenture iDefense has observed global disinformation
continues to battle for “hearts and minds” with threat actors becoming more skilled
at exploiting legitimate tools. While disinformation campaigns to influence domestic
or foreign political sentiment and sway national elections are likely to continue, the
wider potential impact of disinformation on global financial markets is a concern. The
financial services industry—and, more specifically, high-frequency trading algorithms,
which rely upon fast, text-driven sources of information—are likely to be targeted by
large-scale disinformation efforts in the future.

4 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

In January 2019, a firm was targeted by an elaborate hoax involving a
spoofed letter purporting to be written by the fund group’s chief executive
officer.1 The letter claimed the firm was divesting in coal companies in its
actively-managed funds and changing voting patterns to take a stronger
stance on climate change. The adversaries also created a website that
looked like the large investment management corporation’s genuine
webpage. Several thousand people received the fake letter and large news
outlets initially picked up the letter as a legitimate communication. It was
eventually revealed that the letter and website were the work of an activist
seeking to raise awareness for social issues, such as the environment. The
incident emphasized the low barrier to entry for an effective disinformation
campaign. These incidents remain dangerous indicators for the future of
cyberthreats to financial institutions and financial market infrastructures.
A well-orchestrated disinformation campaign may have serious
consequences on brand reputation, specific markets, and even market
stability. The tools required to implement a successful campaign are well
within the capability for ideologically, financially, and politically motivated
threat adversaries already targeting the financial sector.
To take full advantage of the world stage, threat actors are paying
even closer attention to important global events and are using them as
distractions or lures to breach target networks. Accenture iDefense has
seen a sharp decline in “true” hacktivism and is instead seeing more
state-sponsored hacktivism with goals to disrupt events and influence a
wide range of activities in the sponsoring nation’s favor. Nation-states are
increasingly outsourcing malicious cyberoperations to cybercriminals
to increase their capabilities and attain strategic goals—blurring lines
between politically and financially motivated cyberthreat activities.

Executive summary

In such a climate, advances in technology such as artificial intelligence and
fifth-generation cellular network technology (5G) communications could
provide new opportunities for threat actors to achieve their objectives.
And as new avenues are being targeted for attacks, cyberdefenders should
look more closely at how they monitor their supply chain and business
partners in tandem with their own security efforts. Many threat actors
are circumnavigating target networks by trying to breach them via the
networks of trusted partners, business associates and other third-party
networks. As ever, cybercriminals are persistent and inventive—if they can’t
get in one way, they will keep trying until they find another.
From an operational perspective, Accenture iDefense has seen how
some attackers are continuing to focus on infecting legitimate software
applications with malicious code to try to accomplish supply chain
compromises. But they are also making subtle changes to how they
work and who is part of their inner circle. After several high-profile law
enforcement takedowns, threat actors have started to close doors on the
open sharing of malware and exploits and, instead, are sharing within only
smaller, trusted syndicates.
The majority of hackers still rely on human error as the main way to breach
networks; however, with increased awareness of domain-squatting and
phishing, the returns for such attack methods has decreased. Even so,
some tried and tested methods are far from being abandoned. Threat
actors continue to use “living off the land” tools and non-malicious
software, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and PowerShell, in
malicious ways to attempt to avoid detection.2
From a tactical perspective, Accenture iDefense notes that ransomware
attacks have risen as one of the key destructive tools used for financial

gain, with attackers seeking extortion alongside sabotage and
destruction. Many threat actors are reusing existing malware in new
ways or using new types of malware to exploit different types of
vulnerabilities. Threat actors are continuing to abuse code-signing
techniques by using stolen digital certificates to sign their malicious
files and malware to avoid detection.
Further technical impact is being experienced as a result of the
proliferation of the use of cloud computing. This open and popular
environment has prompted security researchers and adversaries to look
for risk in the cloud infrastructure, leading to the discovery of multiple
side-channel vulnerabilities in modern computer microprocessors
(CPUs) over the last two years. Such vulnerabilities pose a high risk
to organizations as adversaries help themselves to better access to
sophisticated and sensitive data.
In the 2017 and 2018 Threatscape reports, Accenture iDefense stated
that organizations need to enhance their threat intelligence capabilities
to stay ahead of cyberthreats, rather than just activate their incident
response plans when their networks are breached. In 2019, this
recommendation has not changed—and is unlikely to change in the
foreseeable future.
In the past year, cybercriminals have continued to test the resilience of
organizations and governments by layering attacks, updating techniques
and establishing new, intricate relationships to better disguise their
identities. It is no longer enough to plan for attacks or understand what
to expect. To help reduce business risks, organizations need to make
a security pivot of their own. By pivoting their approach to security
on a regular basis, they can keep up-to-date with the shifting threat
landscape, organizations’ adversaries and those adversaries’ TTPs, and
be better placed to achieve cyberresilience.

Executive summary

WHAT’S INSIDE?
The 2018 Cyber Threatscape report noted the clear need for more effective
use of actionable threat intelligence. With state-sponsored activities a
growing force to be reckoned with, extended supply chain threats, targets
against critical infrastructure and a surge in miner malware and more
financially motivated advanced persistent threats, CISOs have had their
work cut out to budget and act effectively.
Strong investment in cybersecurity has not been lacking. But despite
these investments, the relentless creativity of cybercriminals continues
to put pressure on organizations to be defense ready. Threat intelligence
provides the right information to make better business decisions. But the
scope of that intelligence is growing. Businesses could start evaluating
their cyberpostures from many different perspectives—the cyberposture
of suppliers, partners and acquisition targets are just as important as their
own organizations to avoid opening up new security gaps or inviting in
threat actors who are dormant or active on third-party networks.
The 2019 Cyber Threatscape report has discovered five factors that are
influencing the cyberthreat landscape:
1. Compromising geopolitics: New threats emerge from disinformation
and technology evolution
Global businesses may find themselves in the crosshairs as
geopolitical tensions persist. As cyberthreat actors take advantage of
high-profile global events and seek to influence mass opinion, we can
expect these actors to not only sustain current levels of activity but
also to take advantage of new capabilities as new technologies enable
more-sophisticated threat TTPs. Geopolitical analysis and a strategiclevel understanding of the events that motivate cyberthreats to action

8 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

can help businesses manage known threats and allocate resources in
anticipation of emerging threats.
2. Cybercriminals adapt, hustle, diversify and are looking more
like states
Despite high-profile law enforcement actions against criminal
communities and syndicates in 2018, the ability of threat actors to
remain operational highlights the significant increase in the maturity
and resilience of criminal networks in 2019. Our analysis indicates
conventional cybercrime and financially-motivated, targeted attacks
will continue to pose a significant threat for individual Internet users
and businesses. However, criminal operations will likely continue to
shift their tactics to reduce risks of detection and disruptions. They
could also attempt to maximize the return on effort in several ways
such as: shifting away from partnerships to operating within close-knit
syndicates; taking advantage of familiarity with the local environment;
increasing the precision of targeting by using legitimate documents to
identify likely victims before delivering malware; or selling and buying
direct access to networks for ransomware delivery rather than carrying
out advanced intrusions.
3. Hybrid motives pose new dangers in ransomware defense
and response
The ransomware threat will be exacerbated further by the sale of
access to corporate networks—through which an attacker can
deploy ransomware on a corporate-wide scale—and the potential of
ransomware with self-propagating abilities (such as WannaCry) to
reemerge could pose a significant threat to businesses, particularly
those with time-critical operations.

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 9

Executive summary

While the motives behind such an attack may appear to be financial,
targeted ransomware attacks may at times serve hybrid motives,
whether financial, ideological, or political. Regardless of motive, while
the ransomware threat remains, organizations must ensure they take
adequate measures to prepare, prevent, detect, respond, and contain
a corporation-wide ransomware attack. Considering the possibility
that an apparently financially-motivated ransomware attack may in
fact serve other purposes, a ransom payment may not guarantee the
restoration of company data; therefore, companies should plan for the
recovery of operations, even in the event of a disruptive loss of data.
4. Improved ecosystem hygiene is pushing threats to the supply chain,
turning friends into frenemies
The global interconnectedness of business, the wider adoption of
traditional industry cyberthreat countermeasures and improvements
to basic cybersecurity hygiene appear to be pushing cyberthreat
actors to seek new avenues to compromise organizations, such as
targeting their supply chains—including those for software, hardware
and the cloud. Organizations should routinely seek full awareness
of their threat profiles and points of supply chain vulnerability.
Organizations can try to improve processes that guard against the
cybersecurity risks inherent in the landscape of modern global
business operations by integrating cyberthreat intelligence into M&As
and other strategically important actions, incorporating vendor and
factory testing into their processes, and implementing industryfocused regulations and risk assessment standards.

10 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

5. Life after meltdown: Vulnerabilities in compute cloud infrastructure
demand costly solutions
The discovery of multiple side-channel vulnerabilities in modern
CPUs over the last two years could pose a high risk to organizations
running their compute infrastructure in the public cloud. Adversaries
can use this class of side-channel vulnerabilities to read sensitive
data from other hosts on the same physical server. Mitigations are
available for most platforms, cloud deployments, and software.
However, most of the mitigations come at a cost of reduced
performance, leading to a potential increase of compute costs for
enterprises. Understanding the threats posed by CPU vulnerabilities
is important to design a proper risk mitigation strategy, which can be
vastly different for each organization.
In this report, Accenture iDefense offers leading practices to
consider for mitigating ransomware, suggestions regarding employee
cybersecurity training, evaluations of international events coming up
in the next 12 months and outlines which threat actors might use such
events for nefarious purposes. Accenture iDefense aims to help its
clients, partners and community members by providing this information
so that they can stay ahead of threats pertinent to their businesses,
industries and geographies.

COMPROMISING GEOPOLITICS: NEW
THREATS EMERGE FROM DISINFORMATION
AND TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION

OVERVIEW
Government agencies, research firms and media reports continue to warn
of cyberthreats to upcoming elections.3 Election threats remain high,
even as defense efforts are also increasing. Meanwhile, many threat actors
continue to try taking advantage of and seek to influence many other types
of global political and geopolitical events, such as international summits,
evolving international tensions and sporting events—like the Olympics.
Phishing lures, destructive malware targeting, and influence operations on
a social media battlefield closely follow global, political and international
events. As a result, these events provide contextual insight and help to
assess the motives, timing and targeting of cyberthreat operations.

TOP-LINE ASSESSMENT: KEY JUDGMENTS
• Social media remains a battleground for the hearts and minds of
worldwide audiences, as it can be used for disinformation and
other forms of information operations to try to sway opinion and
influence policy.
• So-called “cyber-enabled information operations” (CyIO) that can
exploit the openness and speed of communications in cyberspace,
sometimes drawing on cyberthreat operations such as hacking,
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and defacements, are
considered a particular threat. Advances in technology, such as
artificial intelligence and 5G communications, could provide new
opportunities for threat actors to take advantage of and influence
global political events.
• We expect upcoming world events to become the setting for
information operations and other cyberthreat activity—ranging from
espionage to DDoS to destructive attacks. These events include
elections, the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, events related to NATO
expansion and activities, and key commemorative dates.
• Cyberthreat actors could engage with these geopolitical events
in various ways: as opportunists, using them as phishing lures or
distractions, and as participants seeking to influence outcomes.
HACKING MINDS AND HEARTS
When Keir Giles, a security researcher in London, received a LinkedIn
invitation from one “Katie Jones,” who described herself as an area
studies specialist at a Washington DC think tank, he detected something
fishy. He called on other researchers to analyze the profile photo of an

attractive redhead. They soon concluded that “Katie Jones” did not exist;
the photo had been created using generative adversarial networks, or
GANs, a form of artificial intelligence. Whoever created it was apparently
attempting to gain the trust of Keir Giles, and likely to spy on him.4
The case of the illusory “Katie Jones” exemplifies the problem of
disinformation being used for political purposes. Malicious actors can
exploit the capabilities of cyberspace—the speed and openness of the
Internet and other information technologies, as well as legitimate tools,
like artificial intelligence, and illegitimate tools, like malware, to pursue
their strategic goals. All of these come together in what the US Defense
Department and scholars like Dr. Herb Lin of Stanford University call
cyber-enabled information operations. Lin notes that, while traditional
cyberwarfare “prosecutes conflict through the hacking of computers”
cyber-enabled information operations does the same “through the hacking
of people’s minds and hearts.”5
One area in which such operations have been used—elections—dominates
the headlines. Urgent discussions in many countries focus on whether
cyberthreat actors can manipulate vote counts and voter registration
information. Entities, suspected of being SNAKEMACKEREL threat group
actors, unsuccessfully attempted such direct manipulation during the 2014
Ukrainian elections6 and succeeded in obtaining access to local United
States’ election boards in 2016.7

Whether or not such direct manipulation of vote counts is successfully
undertaken in the future, broader cyber-enabled information operations may
continue to target elections worldwide. Threat actors use them, for example,
to discredit candidates, sow doubt in the legitimacy of election results
and undermine confidence in political institutions. Simply compromising
a candidate’s e-mail account to selectively leak compromising information
or even just to threaten to leak it could be used to discredit a politician or
blackmail them into making friendly policy decisions, for example. However,
these operations could go much further than just elections.
DISINFORMATION TRADECRAFT
Disinformation is communication designed to influence perceptions.
Tactics can range from outright falsification, to the selection and distortion
of facts to tell a misleading story.
Disinformation is one type of “information operations” (IO). The United
States military defines IO as actions taken “for the use and management
of information to pursue a competitive advantage.”8 One top social media
company defines IO as “actions taken by organized actors (governments
or non-state actors) to distort domestic or foreign political sentiment,
most frequently to achieve a strategic and/or geopolitical outcome.”9 In
addition to deliberate disinformation, information operations also include
propaganda (the spread of information to promote a particular political
cause) and misinformation (the spread of inaccurate information without
an intent to deceive).10

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Those who carry out disinformation and other IO can do so via “white”
methods (broadcasting one’s message openly through state media),
“grey” methods (placing information in other sympathetic media), and
“black” methods (using hackers, trolls, and honeypots).11 They seek to
target various audiences. For a non-state actor such as a criminal group
or gang, the audiences could include one’s own group members or a rival
group, law enforcement, politicians, or the general public. For a state,
audiences could include one’s own population; the adversary country’s
politicians, bureaucrats or soldiers; various groups within the adversary
country’s population; or world opinion as a whole. Aimed at one’s own
group or population, information operations could seek to reassure, shape
opinion, or scare the population into rallying around a particular purpose.
When targeting politicians or decisionmakers, IO could persuade, scare,
or lure them into making decisions favorable to the group undertaking
the operations. When aimed at an adversary group’s military or general
population, IO may erode its desire to resist, win its support, or gain
leverage by crafting alternate narratives or sowing divisions.
The term “Advanced Persistent Manipulators,” coined by analyst Clint
Watts of the Foreign Policy Research Institute and George Washington
University, describes entities—whether activist or extremist groups, national
governments, political campaigns, lobbyists, businesses or celebrities—that
have the resources to conduct “an extended, sophisticated, multi-platform,
multi-media information attack on a specified target,”12 sometimes combining
online influence campaigns with real-world activities such as rallies. They
can employ “trolling-as-a-service” firms to aggregate audience data
and disseminate targeted and, often inauthentic messaging, sometimes
involving altered data.

Disinformation and other IO pursue goals that can be summed up with
variant catchy “D-words”: “dismiss an opponent’s claims or allegations,
distort events to serve political purposes, distract from one’s own
activities, and dismay those who might otherwise oppose one’s goals.” 13
Another list of D-words to describe the goals “divide, discredit, distract,
deny, and demoralize.” 14
Tactics used in information operations can include false news,
disinformation, or what Facebook calls “false amplifiers”—”networks of fake
accounts aimed at manipulating public opinion.”15 Examples of the use of
these tactics include:
• flooding the media with multiple versions of a story16 to confuse the
audience and make them give up on trying to understand the truth,
similar to the “chaff” used in kinetic warfare to misguide enemy radar;
• publicizing scandalous information to discredit a critic or adversary;
• distracting world opinion from negative information, by highlighting or
even creating some other crisis or scandal; and

CYBER-ENABLED INFORMATION OPERATIONS
CyIO19 can be defined broadly to include any information operations
taking place in cyberspace, including in online media and social media.20
Alternatively, CyIO can be defined more narrowly, to refer to information
operations leveraging offensive cyberthreat activity such as breaches and
DDoS. As the Congressional Research Service summarizes military uses of
CyIO, “Cyberspace operations can be used to achieve strategic information
warfare goals; an offensive cyberattack, for example, may be used to create
psychological effects in a target population. A foreign country may use
cyberattacks to influence decision making and change behaviors,” as in the
massive state-attributed attack on a major entertainment company in 2014
in apparent retaliation for a movie criticizing the state’s leader.21 CyIO can
also weaken a country’s military capabilities by disrupting communications
or serving as a deterrent.22

State-sponsored cyber-enabled information operations combine
cyberthreat activities—such as stealing or altering information or
conducting DDoS attacks—with information operations, like the use
of disinformation and software bots, in attempts to weaken people,
organizations and countries that are hostile to that state. A typical
example could include breaching a target’s e-mails, analyzing the
stolen content to find unflattering information, possibly distorting or
embellishing that information; false hacktivism and creating inauthentic
online personas and troll bots to broadcast the negative information and
to influence popular opinion against the target. 23
SOCIAL MEDIA AS THE DISINFORMATION BATTLEFIELD
Social media has become an increasingly fraught battlefield for cyberthreat
actors and more broadly, information operations. The near omnipresent
role of social media in everyday life has positioned online communities as
target-rich environments which exist beyond the conventional purview of
corporations’ security controls. This has propelled social networks to the
frontlines, as high-yield arenas for manipulation.
In recent years, the research center Citizen Lab, has detailed the
tradecraft of state-affiliated groups spreading disinformation via social
media. One group, given the name “Endless Mayfly,” is suspected of
conducting both disinformation and malware campaigns. Endless
Mayfly used typo-squatted domains to impersonate global news outlets,
“replacing letters with look-alike characters to create visually identical
domains.” 24 These sites were promoted on social media platforms as part

of an effort to spread disinformation to journalists. The group leveraged
extensive use of ephemerality by intentionally deleting content once
it has been sufficiently circulated. Covering one’s tracks could provide
a level of plausible deniability, something upon which state actors
often rely. On at least one occasion, it is believed that Endless Mayfly
also hosted malicious mobile applications, impersonating Twitter, on
a subdomain of one of their disinformation websites, which mimicked
the social media platform. When viewed through the lens of state
surveillance, these types of scenarios become increasingly concerning.
Some nation-states are likely to continue teasing out their opposition and
monitoring their citizens through manipulation of information on social
networks, coupled with spyware campaigns.
Case study: Financial market manipulation via social media bots
From an industry perspective, social media coupled with disinformation, can
present unique challenges. Financial services, specifically high-frequency
trading algorithms which rely upon fast, text-driven sources of information,
are likely to be affected by large-scale disinformation. Academic research
has already found that social media bots “could have an impact on returns,
volatility and trading volume of individual stocks.”25 The research highlights
the converse relationship between amplified messaging (negative or
positive) and the market, raising important policy concerns for safeguarding
financial stability. Maliciously influencing trading in this manner is in some
ways an extension of “pump and dump” activity associated with various
criminal operations, including the group behind the post-SEC EDGAR
breach trades and their larger ecosystem of compatriots.26

Overall, the threat landscape has shifted, opening the door for destructive
malware and autonomous tools to be mixed with fake news, equipping
organized cybercriminals and nation-states with an arsenal of tactics,
techniques and procedures at their disposal. “For financial services,
such an attack could upend the stability and trust that sustains the entire
system. The combination of the multifaceted and multi-staged campaigns
of disinformation, paired with cyberattacks, can be expected to continue in
coming years.”27
Case study: Evolving from misinfodemics to disinfodemics in healthcare
The spread of inaccurate information through social media can have
serious ramifications in healthcare. “Misinfodemics,” a phrase coined by
Harvard researchers, melds misinformation and disease epidemics. The
Harvard researchers note that “digital health misinformation is having
increasingly catastrophic impacts on physical health.”28 Ebola, for example,
has been more easily spread following the dissemination of misleading
online information concerning preventative guidance. Where inaccurate
messages “go viral,” health workers on the ground are met with mistrust
and hostility, making it tough to drive down infection rates. “The spread
of the informational viruses interferes with the fight against actual
biological viruses.”29 One could also hypothesize a parallel scenario of
“disinfodemics,” in which a threat actor deliberately uses disinformation to
catalyze epidemics.

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Hypothetically, disinformation intended to degrade public health could
be utilized by states to target adversarial nations. Actors are likely to use
fabricated media content or falsified personas to discredit legitimate
sources of health information and further degrade them through
cyberattacks. In a tangential example, the SNAKEMACKEREL threat group
targeted international anti-doping agencies in 2018. In an attempt to
discredit the anti-doping community, the state-sponsored actors used
false online accounts to release stolen, sometimes intentionally doctored,
information concerning nearly 250 athletes from almost 30 countries.30
Social media has also been used to spread weaponized lures directly.
Amplification of politicized narratives which elevate topics of interest
to targeted users sets the stage for the success of these lures, as in the
WINTERFLOUNDER example described on page 36. This is one of a
number of ways cyberthreat actors can leverage disinformation during
their campaigns.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, 5G AND DISINFORMATION
Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), present new
avenues of expression for potential geopolitical activity, including
disinformation. One menacing use of AI is in the creation of “deepfakes,”
which are high-quality forged images or videos that could be used for
anything from discrediting or blackmailing a political opponent, rival
company or extortion target, to causing worldwide panic with a video of
a head of state purportedly claiming to have launched a nuclear weapon.
The propagation of synthetic media content, such as deepfakes, is likely to
accelerate as fabrication tools become more accessible and widespread. This
could spill over into the cyberdomain, where both politically and financially

22 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

motivated actors could leverage deepfakes during target reconnaissance on
social networks or social engineering campaigns, for example.
In the report “Know Your Threat: AI Is the New Attack Surface,”31 Accenture
Labs explains this phenomenon and other avenues of adversary
opportunity opened up by increasingly complex machine-learning models,
especially image content and classification, natural language processing
and industrial control systems (ICS). As they focus more on interference
with AI modeling, threat actors and groups are likely to deploy adversarial
AI, corrupting the ability of machine learning algorithms to interpret system
inputs and exercising control over their behavior. To do this, attackers may
create adversarial examples to break the model’s performance, using deep
learning models known as Generative Adversarial Networks. Researchers
have demonstrated proof-of-concept (PoC) attacks against malware
detection and optical character recognition. Adversarial AI using deeplearning applications in natural-language processing could enable the
manipulation of algorithms that determine sentiment, gather intelligence,
or filter for spam and phishing.
Accenture encourages organizations to combine multiple approaches to
help ensure robust, secure AI, especially rate limitation, input validation,
robust model structuring and adversarial training. Media sources have
named various tools to help detect inauthentic videos.32, 33
Another watershed technology with the potential to enable massive
surveillance and disruption is fifth-generation cellular network technology,

or 5G. This technology promises the local processing of data by so-called
edge servers and base stations, potentially increasing data speed and
efficiency up to a hundredfold over the current cellular data rate; however,
this local control means those who control the infrastructure could tamper
or spread disinformation to 5G users.34 These issues dovetail into national
security concerns, as core multinational disagreements persist around
the accountability of 5G infrastructure providers and concerns that the
control of equipment and software in 5G infrastructure could enable a
small group of companies to conduct information operations against a
global population of users. We believe sufficiently advanced AI and Edge
systems in control of layer seven application data could dynamically splice
deepfakes into streaming content to select users. This technique would
likely be used to target VIPs and other decision makers while they consume
news media.
HACKTIVISM MASKS
One type of cyber-enabled information operations is hacktivism.
Increasingly, Accenture iDefense has found it used by state rather than nonstate actors. In some cases it is used to discredit the same organizations
that seek to counter disinformation.35 Hacktivism is one of the most visible
and colorful areas of the cyberthreat landscape and draws on a wide range
of ideological and political inspirations found across the world—hacktivists
attempt to advance their political agendas by seeking to damage, degrade
or disrupt organizations through interference with or attacks against
networked systems.

IntelGraph reporting.

24 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

While conventional, independent hacktivism has been gradually declining
in volume and impact since its peak in 2011, intelligence organizations
from several countries appear to have sought to direct and support
friendly hacktivist actors and exploit false hacktivist personas to carry
out information operations. Hacktivists’ activity, especially when directed
against high-profile targets, tends to generate attention disproportionate
to their actual technical impact on the networked systems targeted. Even
in the absence of serious technical damage, negative publicity can inflict
reputational and financial losses and legal costs, potentially including
fines mandated in the European Union by the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR).36
Accenture iDefense has developed a system for assessing the degree of a
hacktivist persona’s likely relationship with a government, including factors
such as whether the persona’s stated ideological goals and activities align
with those of a government and whether their aims and targets evolve
in response to changing priorities of that government. As an example,
some 19 percent of a sample of events covering the 2007 to 2017 period
that Accenture iDefense analyzed can be linked to suspected fully statecontrolled personas.37
Actors can use false hacktivist personas predominantly to publicize
sensitive data obtained from the targeted entity. If the information itself is
sufficiently sensitive, hacktivists may “dump” the raw data on a hacktivist
messaging site or through social media, but perpetrators may also adjust
the data through focused selection or falsification to spin a desired
narrative. The attempted manipulation of data leaked from the 2017
campaign of French President François Macron exemplifies the practice of

adjusting the data to spin a desired narrative.38 Hacktivists often seek to
circulate data through social media or mainstream media sites to reach a
wider audience.
Case study: The integrity initiative
Between November 5, 2018, and May 7, 2019, the Integrity Initiative39—a
UK-based not-for-profit charity describing itself as dedicated to education
in good governance—suffered seven information disclosures of information
regarding its members, finances, operating goals and recruitment initiatives.
An actor using the moniker “Anonymous” posted the leaks to CyberGuerrilla,
a leaks website that Russian-speaking hacktivists use often (see Figure 1).40
“Anonymous” constructed a narrative implying that the United Kingdom
government used the initiative as an information campaign to undermine
Russia by installing pro-Western individuals in prominent positions
throughout Europe. Following the disclosures, Russian state media outlets
like Sputnik News and RT swiftly circulated the leaks to a wider audience.
The SNAKEMACKEREL threat group carried out a similar attack targeting the
German Council on Foreign Relations, the Aspen Institute and the German
Marshall Fund in late 2018, according to Microsoft research.41

CHALLENGES OF FIGHTING DISINFORMATION AND OTHER
INFORMATION OPERATIONS
Detecting and counteracting the spread of deliberate disinformation
can be difficult. In Estonia, a highly digitized country that suffered a
massive cyberattack in 2007 and continual disinformation campaigns,
volunteer “Baltic elves” monitor the Internet for disinformation, a
CyberDefense League of IT specialists shares threat information, and
the government has fined or suspended biased media sources.45
Attempts to fight disinformation in court are long and expensive, and
the perpetrators may never be brought to justice, as in the case of
alleged disinformation experts indicted by the team of Special Counsel
Robert Mueller. 46
Finally, threat actors may make deliberate attempts to discredit the very
investigators who are uncovering disinformation, as in the case of the
Integrity Initiative, described above.

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

CYBERTHREAT USES OF GLOBAL EVENTS:
OPPORTUNISM AND PARTICIPATION
Every significantly impactful or highly visible event offers an occasion for
cyberthreat actors to emerge, seeking to capitalize on the access a target
affords or the scale of a potential cybercrime profit. Cyberthreat adversaries
may use those events opportunistically, participate in them, or both.
As opportunists, threat actors can take advantage of the impact or visibility
of events by using several techniques, such as crafting phishing lures
with distracting e-mail subject lines related to recent events, setting up
counterfeit websites and misleading e-mail sender domains, and turning
poorly defended event websites into watering holes, to name just a few
examples. Whether criminally or financially motivated, threat actors may
seek to take advantage of legal changes, price swings or international
geopolitical maneuvering. They may use dramatic headlines about world
events to lure victims into activating malicious documents. Any current
event can present an opportunity for exploitation.
As participants, threat actors may seek to influence events themselves.
Governments may use cyberthreat activity to pursue strategic goals in various
ways: using espionage to steal technology benefiting national industries and
military programs or to gain visibility into or leverage over political decision
making in a target country; stealing money to fund a regime or movement;
conducting cyber-enabled information operations to influence opinion
or decision making; and engaging in disruptive or destructive activities
designed to weaken or demoralize an adversary and demonstrate a credible
threat to deter adversaries from belligerent behavior.

32 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

A COST-BENEFIT PROPOSITION
Political analysis helps put cyberthreat capabilities into perspective, as
they are one of many tools a state or criminal may rely on to advance
their interests. It is understood that states weigh the perceived benefits
of computer network exploitation or attack against its risks and costs in
comparison to military, diplomatic or economic options while criminal
actors operate within legal and political contexts and may demonstrate
patriotism or provide expertise and services to government officials to
reduce the risk of punishment for their activities. Evaluation of these
generally consistent influences can help assess future behavior.
Evaluating political factors, Accenture iDefense assessed55 in early April
2019 that although Ukraine had withstood geopolitical cyberthreat activity
in the past, a country hostile to Ukraine would likely refrain from blatant
attempts to disrupt or alter the results of its 2019 presidential election, as
an adversary country could pursue its broader goals in other, less-costly
ways. As expected, at the end of April, Ukrainian authorities announced
there had been no major cyberattacks against its elections.56 Similarly,
countries subject to heavy economic sanctions or harsh tariffs from other
countries must weigh the potential benefits of retaliation, including via
cyberthreat means, against the prospect that retaliation may alienate
sympathetic countries.57
Drawing on an analysis of possible motivations for conducting disruptive
cyberattacks, Accenture iDefense estimated correctly that political

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

tensions surrounding the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics would
motivate cyberthreat actors to disrupt the events, whereas threat actors
may have much less incentive to disrupt the World Cup tournament.58 As
the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics approach, international tensions could
incentivize a variety of political actors to try disrupting the games. Those
actors and incentives should become more apparent as the games draw
closer and political events evolve. In addition, the 2020 Olympics and other
major international events like the 2019 Rugby World Cup could provide
opportunities for ticket fraud and other financially motivated cyberthreat
activity that usually accompanies such events.59
Political analysis of any sort is not a foolproof predictive tool; however, an
understanding of the environments in which cyberthreat actors operate,
the pressures and incentives that motivate them, the costs and benefits
they may calculate, and the nature of their targeting, can help assess the
likelihood and confidence of potential cyberthreat action. As events unfold,
the comparison of actual results against predictions can further tune
estimated calculations.
USE OF CURRENT EVENTS AS LURES
In 2019, Accenture iDefense analysts observed numerous cyberthreat
groups leveraging global and regional current events (including
political, military and social) as themes for content in spear phishing lure
documents, which according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework are used as
an Initial Access tactic to gain a foothold into targeted networks.60

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Accenture iDefense analysts estimate that SNAKEMACKEREL actors could
continue to leverage notable political and military events as themes in
future spear phishing lure document content and almost certainly with
regard to upcoming military and defense conferences.
The WINTERFLOUNDER cyberthreat group (also known as Gamaredon
Group66) has also consistently used geopolitical and military themes as lures
against entities that may be government and public sector bodies based
in Ukraine. Accenture iDefense has found two lure documents attached to
spear phishing e-mails that WINTERFLOUNDER actors sent in April 2019;
the group used both along with the Pterodo custom backdoor to target
unknown entities likely based in Ukraine. One lure bears similarity to other
WINTERFLOUNDER phishing activity focused on the Ukraine elections.67

The Ukrainian blackouts of 2015 and 2016 and the devastating Petya.A
(NotPetya) attack of June 2017 showed the power of destructive and
disruptive malware.69 Several countries’ intelligence services reported
that cyberthreat actors from adversary countries have pre-positioned
backdoors throughout large parts of the global financial, physical and
Internet infrastructure, with these backdoors potentially capable of being
triggered in a destructive or disruptive attack. A January 2019 assessment

by the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI),
for example, named countries it deems capable of using cyberattacks to
disrupt United States natural gas pipelines for days or weeks and electrical
distribution networks for hours. The capabilities ODNI described do not
necessarily need to be used in the foreseeable future. The mere awareness
of their existence influences policymakers to carefully consider the use
of offensive or even retaliatory cyberattacks. In fact, turning off lights in
a large country or causing a dam to fail may cross unclear lines of what
actions are acts of war, thus inviting retaliation. But the simple threat that
an adversary could unleash these outcomes could have a deterrent effect.70
SUMMARY
Accenture iDefense expects global businesses to find themselves in the
crosshairs as geopolitical tensions persist. As cyberthreat actors take
advantage of high-profile global events and seek to influence mass opinion,
the world can expect these actors to not only sustain current levels of
activity but also to take advantage of new capabilities as new technologies
enable more-sophisticated threat TTPs. Geopolitical analysis and a
strategic-level understanding of the events that motivate cyberthreats to
action can help businesses manage known threats and allocate resources
in anticipation of emerging threats.

CYBERCRIMINALS ADAPT, HUSTLE,
DIVERSIFY AND ARE LOOKING MORE
LIKE STATES

OVERVIEW
Conventional cybercrime and financially motivated targeted attacks remain
highly active, despite several high-profile law enforcement takedowns
in 2018;71 however, Accenture iDefense has observed several significant
changes in cybercrime that analysts have broken down into four distinct
sections: conventional cybercrime operations, localized cybercrime,
targeted attacks and “hack ‘n’ hustle.”
TOP-LINE ASSESSMENT: KEY JUDGMENTS
• Conventional cybercrime operations continued to be active during
2019, with actors sharing document builders and malware for use in
crimeware campaigns and targeted intrusions.72 But we can observe
a new level of resilience and maturity in organized cybercrime as
crimeware groups shift their operating model from one of open
partnerships on underground forums to one of close-knit syndicates
due to high-profile law enforcement actions.

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 39

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

• Localized underground economies continue to emerge and grow in
non-English-speaking countries such as China and Brazil, which tend
to target their domestic populations due to familiarity with their own
societies, cultures and environments.
• An attack trend known as “big game hunting”, where cybercriminal
threat actors and groups conduct targeted intrusions for financial
gain, is on the increase. It can include the use of a wide range of
bespoke malware and commodity “crimeware” available for download
or purchase from underground forums and marketplaces and
frequently uses legitimate penetration testing tools.
• Network access can be used to carry out a range of malicious
activities, and there has been a marked increase in the sale of remote
access to compromised networks on underground forums and
marketplaces. The number of incidents where financially motivated
threat actors employ commodity malware to conduct intrusions for
financial gain is also on the rise.
SECURE SYNDICATES: A NEW MODEL FOR CYBERCRIME OPERATIONS
Crimeware spam campaigns continued to be active in 2018 and 2019, with
Emotet, AZORult, Loki Bot, Pony, NanoCore and Nocturnal among the most
commonly observed types of crimeware. The most-common type of spam
campaign attachments used to deliver malware remain Microsoft Office
documents weaponized with malicious macros, closely followed by richtext format (RTF) documents with embedded object linking and embedding
(OLE) objects created to exploit vulnerabilities such as the CVE-2017-11882
vulnerability. Exploit kit activity over the last 12 months came primarily from
the Fallout, RIG and GrandSoft exploit kits.73 Attackers have used exploit

kits such as Magnitude, Underminer and GreenFlash Sundown to deliver
ransomware primarily to Asian countries. 74
In addition to the conventional waves of crimeware spam campaigns,
Accenture iDefense analysts have observed the shared use of commodity
document builders, such as ThreadKit, and script-based malware, such
as More_Eggs, among conventional crimeware campaigns and targeted
attack groups, such as Cobalt Group, making attribution more difficult
and further highlighting the intricate relationships between actors in the
underground economy.
Accenture iDefense analysts assess that conventional crimeware
campaigns could continue to be active. However, given the recent
high-profile takedowns of popular underground communities such as
Alphabay,  75 Hansa76 and, more recently, Wall Street,77 the operating model
of crimeware groups may continue to shift from that of loosely connected
affiliates or partnerships toward that of more closely knit syndicates.
REGIONAL CYBERCRIME: EXPLOITATION OF LOCALIZED
TECHNOLOGIES
Accenture iDefense analysts observe that cybercrime scenes differ from
region to region depending on each region’s status of technological
development, Internet culture, and social, political, legal and economic
environment. This difference has been growing stronger since 2018. As
targeting domestically provides the advantage of familiarity with the local

environment, regional cybercriminals often choose to do so and seek to
exploit popular, localized technologies, such as online payment platforms
or communication tools, for financial gains.
In emerging economies such as China,78 current national economic
development strategies highly encourage technology-oriented innovation,
leading to a sharp rise in the development, adoption and exportation
of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial
intelligence (AI), robotics and smart cities, all of which play an important
role in driving economic growth, though the legal regulations of
such technologies often lag behind.79 However, the hasty adoption of
emerging but otherwise immature technology, such as the development
of cryptocurrency, mobile payments and Fintech, has led to more
opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit for financial gain.80
Cybercriminals often develop equivalent “black technology”81 to explore
new technologies to obtain illicit profits. For example, in China, digital
financial fraud that utilizes Fintech is a growing trend in 2018.82 This kind
of financial fraud combines big data and AI technologies to analyze stolen
personally identifiable information (PII) to target victims with tailored fraud
scenarios, which increases attack success rates and the efficiency of fraud
activities and lowers the costs of conducting fraudulent acts.83

BIG GAME HUNTING: MORE TARGETED ATTACKS
Accenture iDefense analysts have observed a significant increase in the
past two years in cybercriminal threat actors and groups conducting
targeted intrusions for financial gain. This attack trend, which is sometimes
referred to as “big game hunting,” can include the use of a wide range
of bespoke malware and commodity “crimeware” malware available for
download or purchase from underground forums and marketplaces,
including banking Trojans, information stealers, keyloggers and loaders.
Cybercriminal threat actors carrying out targeted intrusions also frequently
use legitimate penetration testing tools, such as Metasploit, Cobalt Strike,
PowerShell Empire (PSE), Meterpreter and Mimikatz. Accenture iDefense
analysts have continued to observe activities from targeted attacks threat
groups, with FIN7, Cobalt Group and Contract Crew (also known as Silence)
being the most prominent and active such groups.
FIN7
FIN784 is an advanced cybercriminal group that specializes in targeted
attacks against organizations in the retail, hospitality and financial services
sectors. FIN7 is highly organized and vertically structured, operating
under the front of a legitimate penetration testing company named
Combi Security. FIN7 typically conducts spear-phishing attacks using
malicious document attachments against selected individuals in targeted
organizations. Malware delivered in these attacks has included the
Carbanak implant and bespoke script-based implants such as HALFBAKED,
Bateleur and DNSMessenger. In addition, FIN7 has used a wide range of
penetration testing tools such as Meterpreter, Cobalt Strike and Mimikatz
for initial access and post-exploitation activities. Other bespoke malware
that Accenture iDefense analysts have observed include 7Logger, Vampire
84 iDefense Security Intelligence Services. “FIN7.” January 16, 2019. IntelGraph reporting.

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 43

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Loader and a memory-scraping malware known as Vampire Dumper, all of
which were designed to be used on point-of-sale (PoS) infrastructure. The
group focuses heavily on carrying out targeted attacks to exfiltrate datasets
of value for resale, especially payment card industry (PCI) data.
During the past 12 months, Accenture iDefense analysts have observed
that despite the indictments that the United States Department of Justice
issued in August 2018, FIN7 continues to be active. Although still active,
there have been significant changes in the group’s TTPs, including the use
of a new script-based backdoor called GUDWIN85 (also known as GRIFFON),
which resembles a simplified version of the Bateleur backdoor, as well
the use of legitimate documents with embedded images from remote
sources to identify individuals who are likely to open malicious documents.
The changes indicate that the group is trying to reduce its footprint on
targeted networks by increasing the precision of its targeting. Based on the
telemetry from Accenture iDefense and partners during the past 12 months,
Accenture iDefense assesses with moderate confidence that FIN7’s primary
focus remains on the retail and hospitality sectors.86
Cobalt Group
Cobalt Group87 is an advanced financially motivated threat group that
has been active since as early as mid–2016. Accenture iDefense analysts
have observed several of the group’s distinctive TTPs, including the
preference and ability to create new first-stage malware families and
the reuse of specific mail servers in multiple campaigns. The group also
exhibits a preference for using Cobalt Strike as a main payload to establish
access to compromised machines and entrench on target networks.

44 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

Activity during late 2018 and early 2019 has mostly revolved around the
CobInt (also known as COOLPANTS) malware family. This group primarily
focuses on targeting financial services in the United States, Europe and
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, including Russia.
Cobalt Group displays a strong preference for delivering malware via
spear phishing with the use of malicious Office documents that are similar
those that FIN7 uses. Accenture iDefense analysts have observed the use
of Microsoft Word Intruder and ThreadKit builders to generate malicious
documents. As of late 2018 and into 2019, the group is using the Word
macro-based download kit referred by Accenture iDefense analysts as
Little Pig to download the CobInt backdoor malware, which enables deeper
reconnaissance and lateral movement, as the malware has the ability
to download other malware components. Despite the arrests of three
individuals associated with the group, activity continues into 2019.
Contract Crew
Contract Crew88 is a financially motivated threat group that targets financial
institutions with a focus on automated teller machines (ATMs) in the CIS
region since at least 2016. As of late 2018 and early 2019, Contract Crew
has reportedly expanded its targeting beyond Russia and Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) countries to include European and Middle
Eastern countries. Contract Crew exhibits a strong preference for using
spear-phishing e-mails to deliver malicious files to intended targets,
with those e-mails subsequently dropping first-stage malware on a
targeted system. The types of malicious files delivered include JavaScript
downloaders, VBScript downloaders disguised as OLE-embedded objects
in DOCX documents, documents weaponized with CVE-2015-2545 or CVE2017-0199 exploits, CHM files embedded in DOC files, RAR or ZIP archives

containing additional nested file types, and Windows Shortcut file (.lnk)
downloaders. Exploitation via any of these methods would then trigger
the download and execution of the Silence Downloader, which would
subsequently download the Silence backdoor’s main module. The group
also has custom proxy toolsets that can be deployed to enable access
to harder-to-reach networks, such as those inside financial institutions.
Contract Crew uses multiple stages of execution to include the use of
legitimate system utilities to increase obfuscation and dwell time. Activities
from Contract Crew have been observed to continue well into 2019.
NETWORK ACCESS FOR SALE
Over the course of the last two to three years, Accenture iDefense has
observed a marked increase in the sale of remote access to compromised
networks on underground forums and marketplaces, as well as an increase
in the number of incidents in which financially motivated threat actors
employ commodity malware to conduct intrusions for financial gain.
Actors can use network access to carry out an array of malicious activities,
including malware distribution, theft of PII, exfiltration of payment card
data and more, although how to use a network where an actor has
purchased access is ultimately up to that buyer. Since the beginning of
2019, Accenture iDefense has observed several high-profile threat groups
engaged in the buying and selling of network access in the underground.
Such examples include “Nikolay,” a group specializing in the sale of
access to numerous corporate networks, and “GandCrab,” an enterprise
distributing ransomware through an affiliate program it operates.
Nikolay is a threat group that Accenture iDefense observes and monitors
that maintains a presence on several Russian- and English-language
underground forums, using a number of aliases across these underground
forums. Nikolay specializes in selling access to compromised networks

46 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

across multiple verticals. Accenture iDefense analysts assess with
moderate confidence that Nikolay relies on compromised RDP connections
to obtain and sell corporate network access (see Figure 5). Analysis of
forum postings suggests Nikolay took a hiatus between December 2018
and March 2019, during which the group indicated that its RDP exploits
were “no longer working,” thus rendering the group’s primary tool obsolete.
Since returning, the group has updated its sales focus by disclosing the
number of machines to which they sell access—something they did not
do initially. Accenture iDefense notes that this disclosure was likely made
to capitalize on the ongoing trend in which actors conduct ransomware
attacks through RDP connections.
Figure 5. Advertisement from Nikolay selling RDP access to franchise retail operator
(sensitive details redacted)

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 47

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Since March 2018, the group using the alias GandCrab on a popular
Russian-language underground forum has distributed ransomware of the
same name through an affiliate program model advertised on that forum.
This model involves the group recruiting partners that are paid to distribute
the ransomware through means such as spam, exploit kits and targeted
attacks. Upon successful distribution, affiliates will receive 60 percent
to 80 percent of all ransom payments, while GandCrab will pocket the
remaining 20 percent to 40 percent.89
In January 2019, Accenture iDefense observed GandCrab posted a
discussion thread in which the group offered to monetize remote access
to compromised corporate networks (see Figure 6). The group expressed
interest in gaining entry to corporate networks through RDP or VPN
software such as Cisco ASA, AnyConnect or OpenVPN. In the event that
forum members can provide GandCrab with entry, the group will try to
deploy its ransomware onto the victim network and split all proceeds
50–50 with the access providers. In the discussion thread, the group states
that it will utilize licensed versions of popular penetration testing tools such
as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit Pro to gain network access.

Version 5.0.” September 27, 2018. IntelGraph reporting.

48 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

The increase in sales of access to compromised networks and growth in
targeted intrusions on the part of financially driven threat actors suggests
that this market has proven lucrative, which is evidenced by the fact that
Nikolay has purportedly sold access to individual networks for tens of
thousands of dollars—a belief based on numerous claims from the group
on underground websites. Additionally, Accenture iDefense has observed
countless other threat actors selling network access for similar monetary
amounts. Even if malicious actors with access to valuable corporate assets
do not possess the necessary knowledge to monetize access, there are
countless opportunities to earn income through either selling access or
partnering with others with more advanced skill sets.
SUMMARY
Financially motivated actors remain highly active despite high-profile
law enforcement actions against criminal communities and syndicates in
2018. That these actors’ abilities to remain operational despite the arrests
highlights the significant increase in the maturity and resilience of criminal
networks in 2019. Accenture iDefense analysts assess with high confidence
that conventional cybercrime and financially motivated targeted attacks
will continue to pose a significant threat for individual Internet users
and businesses. However, criminal operations will likely continue to shift
their tactics to reduce risks of detection and disruptions, as well as to
maximize the return on effort, in several ways such as: shifting away from
partnerships to operating within close-knit syndicates; taking advantage of
familiarity with the local environment; increasing the precision of targeting
by using legitimate documents to identify likely victims before delivering
malware; or selling and buying direct access to networks to deliver
ransomware rather than carrying out advanced intrusions.

HYBRID MOTIVES POSE NEW
DANGERS IN RANSOMWARE
DEFENSE AND RESPONSE

OVERVIEW
Ransomware attacks can cause serious disruption to business operations
and can be costly, even if the data has been backed up properly and is
securely stored offline. The attacks involving the Goga ransomware, for
example, have reportedly cost victim organizations at least US$40 million
in the first quarter of 2019.90 It is no surprise for Accenture iDefense
analysts to observe the continuation of ransomware attacks and the
emergence of targeted ransomware attacks. Organizations should ask
themselves not only if they are implementing leading practices for security
to protect against ransomware attacks, but also if they understand the ways
in which their organizations may be targeted.
TOP-LINE ASSESSMENT: KEY JUDGMENTS
• Aside from delivering ransomware via spam campaigns, threat
actors appear to be planting ransomware directly on networks by
purchasing from underground communities Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) access to compromised servers obtained through vulnerability
exploitation and RDP brute forcing.91
• Ransomware attacks can significantly affect organizations financially
by disrupting business operations, and the fact that the cost to repair
or restore systems can be high.

• Accenture iDefense analysts have observed daily spam campaigns
spreading Troldesh, ransomware attacks involving Goga,
Globelmposter and Cryakl; and extortion attacks using commercial
encryption software rather than malware.95

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Accenture iDefense assesses that ransomware attacks may continue to
make substantial amounts of money for threat actors. The median demand
for ransom that Accenture iDefense analysts observed in 2018 was around
US$10,000 per incident, with the highest demand being US$8.5 million.
The healthcare industry, financial institutions and professional services
were targeted the most.103 Accenture iDefense also assesses that there
may be a trend toward using updatable malware, such as a downloader,
remoted administration tool, bot or backdoor, to download a ransomware
component on compromised machines, as depicted in Figure 9.

The “Best Practices for Ransomware Mitigation” section provides
recommendations for mitigating the risks of ransomware.
Motives of ransomware attacks
Accenture iDefense assesses that the following motives for carrying out
ransomware attacks exist:
• Hacktivism
• Financial gain
• Destruction posing as ransomware attack
• Geopolitical messaging
Hacktivism
Ransomware may actualize apparent hacktivist campaigns such as the
JCry ransomware deployed as part of OpJerusalem (see Figure 10) in which
the motive behind the attack is to use the usual ransom note is used to
convey an ideological agenda and/or disrupt the business operations of the
targeted organizations.

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Financial gain
In addition to targeting by specific countries, threat actors may search
for organizations that have the fiscal resources necessary to pay a large
ransom. Threat actors can find opportunistic elements to exploit, such as
RDP systems with weak or already-compromised credentials that can serve
as a access points for a site-wide ransomware campaign.105 As an example,
the Goga ransomware (see Figure 11), which hit numerous companies in the
engineering, chemicals, and metals industries, is a targeted threat that may
have been deployed via opportunistic means.

56 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

In addition to compromising networks themselves, ransomware actors
may purchase access to networks that have already been compromised,
providing faster access to systems for such threat actors’ own attacks. As
an example, a threat actor known as “Nikolay” was advertising the sale of
compromised networks in early 2019, providing a listing of the number of
compromised nodes and stating in the advertisement that these hosts were
suitable for ransomware.107
With the focus on larger and more substantial targets, threat actors can
maintain their motive of realizing a higher ROI,108 which, in turn, attracts
actors with more resources and skills to such campaigns. Accenture
iDefense assesses that more experienced threat actors typically practice
better tradecraft and operational security, which leads to longer-running
campaigns that are less subject to law enforcement disruption. Other
successful campaign activity may include affiliate programs.
Actor “BulletToothTony” has advertised a Snatch ransomware affiliate
program in which the malware is not sold, but affiliates are given a percent
of any successfully obtained income.109 In some cases, as in the case of
the JSWORM affiliate program, these shares may be near 70 percent for
the affiliate and 30 percent for the non-affiliate organizer who provides
the malware, infrastructure and other elements required for a successful
ransomware campaign.110 In this way, threat actors can focus on areas of
specialization, leading to a higher volume of successful campaign activity.

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Destruction posing as ransomware attack
Ransomware can also serve hybrid motives, including a mix of financial
and/or ideological purposes. Some ransomware appears to have been
deployed to destroy information on a target rather than to efficiently
make money. Ransomware’s ability to destroy data, degrade performance
and disrupt services can enable threat actors to cover up evidence of
espionage, fraud or other crimes, as Accenture iDefense has shown.111
It can also be used to manipulate markets by discrediting major market
players, lowering the target company’s share price and raising the price of
the company’s product by cutting off production. The Goga ransomware
that paralyzed a Scandinavian aluminum company in March 2019 involved
a variant that makes it difficult to pay the ransom,112 suggesting that its
real target may have been the victim company’s share price. Although
this would suggest an ultimately financial motive, the intended immediate
effect may be destructive rather than the collection of a ransom payment.
The motives behind a ransomware attack can also be political. The Petya
malware outbreak of June 27, 2017, appears to have been a geopolitical attack
aimed at paralyzing government and business in Ukraine (see Figure 12).113 It
targeted that country by infecting an update of a software application that
is widely used for tax filings and other official functions there, but it also
crippled other companies that do business in Ukraine. In the future, politically
motivated ransomware attacks that target a country could again be spread by
infecting or replacing software that is widely used in a target country, such as
tax or other government software unique to that country.

Figure 12. Petya ransom message 114

Geopolitical messaging
Even a single ransomware campaign can serve a mix of financial and political
purposes. For example, GandCrab, a criminal ransomware group, expressly
refrains from targeting people in certain countries. Many cybercriminals
refrain from targeting their co-nationals to avoid criminal prosecution and
the group’s targeting behavior could be motivated by their being located in
the same country as their targets. In October 2018, GandCrab also vowed
to provide decryption keys to people in war-torn Syria as a humanitarian
gesture; however, it declared it would never release keys to victims in other
countries, as “we need to continue punitive proceedings against certain
countries.”115 Accenture iDefense observed that GandCrab’s targeting in
October included entities in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands—
countries that had actively investigated and denounced chemical attacks
by the Syrian government against civilians.116 Other possible motives for

the timing of the aforementioned Goga attack on a Scandinavian aluminum
manufacturer in March could be political.
LEADING PRACTICES FOR RANSOMWARE MITIGATION
The following mitigations are leading practices:117
• General ransomware mitigation methods: In general, to counter
ransomware issues, Accenture iDefense recommends maintaining
regular backups of system data, preferably via a cloud-based solution.
Additional recommendations include the following:
–– Ensure that anti-virus products and endpoint solutions are
up-to-date.
–– Maintain regular and robust backups of storage devices, servers
and end-users’ computer data.
–– In case of infection or detection of malware, immediately disconnect
affected systems from the network on which they reside.
–– Re-image infected systems whenever possible and restore users’
data from backups.
–– Do not contact an attacker or pay a ransom.
–– Monitor and revoke invalid, abused or compromised certificates from
trust stores and certificate authorities at their organizational sites.
–– Possibly consider using obfuscation and deception
countermeasures against ransomware that target specific file

60 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

extensions by internally using unique extensions types and
associating them with the appropriate application. For instance,
configure company devices to open and save .doc files as .dlldox
files, which ransomware should ignore as unimportant or as system
files. Organizations could use the same technique to also obfuscate
other files types.
• Active Directory mitigation methods:
–– Use Azure ATP, Azure identity protection and Azure AD Conditional
Access.118
–– Implement the following suggestions for detecting DCShadow:119
• Monitor and analyze network traffic associated with data
replication (such as calls to DrsAddEntry, DrsReplicaAdd and
especially GetNCChanges) between domain controllers (DCs), as
well as to and from non-DC hosts.
• Consider monitoring for and alerting on the replication of active
directory (AD) objects.
• Leverage AD directory synchronization (DirSync) to detect
changes to the state of the directory using AD replication cookies.
• Create a baseline and periodically analyze the configuration
partition of the AD schema and set up alerting on the creation of
nTDSDSA objects.

• Investigate the use of Kerberos Service Principal Name (SPNs),
especially those associated with services (beginning with “GC/”)
by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU).
• RDP mitigation methods: Accenture iDefense suggests the following
mitigation methods against RDP attacks:120
–– Disable the RDP service if it is unnecessary. If necessary, do not
leave RDP accessible from the Internet.
–– Remove unnecessary accounts and groups from Remote Desktop
Users groups, and enable firewall rules to block RDP traffic between
network security zones.
–– Audit the Remote Desktop Users group membership regularly and
remove the local administrators’ group from the list of groups
allowed to log in through RDP.
–– Limit remote user permissions if remote access is necessary. Use
remote desktop gateways and multifactor authentication for remote
logins. Make sure a strong password requirement is in place.
–– Change group policy objects (GPOs) to define shorter timeout
sessions and maximum amounts of time any single session can
be active and set a maximum amount of time that a disconnected
session stays active on the RD session host server.
–– Change GPOs to set the maximum amount of time that a
disconnected session stays active on the RD session host server.

62 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

–– Ensure any third-party vendors that require RDP access have
security procedures in place and are following them.
• Suggested vulnerability mitigation methods against Exploit Kits:
–– Patch vulnerabilities associated with software.
–– Apply software updates as they become available.
–– Use a supported and recent Windows operating system.
–– Ensure that anti-virus products and endpoint solutions are
up-to-date.
• Recommended phishing campaign mitigation methods:
–– Ensure that anti-virus products and endpoint solutions are
up-to-date.
–– Regularly train users to not click links or open attachments in e-mails
from unknown or untrusted sources, particularly external sources.
–– Search mail server logs to see if any user within the corporation has
received the same or similar e-mails by looking at e-mail subjects,
e-mail true senders, e-mail X-mailer headers, e-mail sender IP
addresses, file attachment names or hashes.
–– If other users have received malicious e-mails, remove the e-mails
from their inboxes before they have opened them to mitigate the
risk from those e-mails.
–– If users have opened a malicious e-mail, further investigate the
user’s asset using available network and system logs to look for
indications of the e-mail attachment(s) being executed on the host
and network communication associated with any malware family

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 63

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

attributed to the e-mail attachments. If there is evidence that a user
has executed the associated malware, the affected user should have
a corporate malware remediation process applied and immediately
have their passwords reset.
• Server Message Block (SMB) mitigation methods related to
EternalBlue: Accenture iDefense recommends implementing the
following mitigation methods related to EternalBlue and ransomware:
–– Apply the Microsoft patch for the MS17-010 SMB vulnerabilities.
–– Disable SMBv1 wherever possible.
–– Do not allow SMB connections directly from the Internet.
–– Follow best practice guidelines related to ransomware infections
that computer emergency readiness teams (CERTs) have issued.
–– Quarantine attachments.
–– Segment affected hosts.
–– Prevent the shutdown of victim systems until appropriate staff can
triage those systems.
–– Restore hosts to known good states.
–– Ensure that backups are available and work.
–– Use a privilege forest explorer to verify that least-privilege
accessibility is in place.
–– Disable the execution of any files that carry the name “perfc.dat” as
well as the PSExec utility from the Sysinternals Suite.

64 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

SUMMARY
The ransomware threat will continue to be a worldwide threat against
all industry sectors, but the sale of access to corporate networks (see
“Network access for sale” section starting on page 46) through which an
attacker can deploy ransomware on a corporate-wide scale could further
exacerbate the threat. Ransomware with self-propagating abilities (such
as WannaCry) could re-emerge to pose a significant threat to businesses,
particularly those with time-critical operations.
While the motives behind such an attack may appear to be financial,
targeted ransomware attacks may at times serve hybrid motives, whether
financial, ideological, or political. Regardless of motive, the ransomware
threat will remain for the foreseeable future; businesses should try to
ensure they have taken the adequate measures to prepare, prevent,
detect, respond, and contain any corporation-wide ransomware attack.
Considering the possibility that an apparently financially-motivated
ransomware attack may in fact serve other purposes, a ransom payment
may not guarantee the restoration of company data; therefore, companies
should plan for the recovery of operations even in the event of a disruptive
loss of data.

IMPROVED ECOSYSTEM HYGIENE IS
PUSHING THREATS TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN,
TURNING FRIENDS INTO FRENEMIES

OVERVIEW
Supply chain and third-party cyberthreats continue to be prominent risks for
corporations and individuals globally. The traditional boundaries of attack
surfaces are shifting as suppliers, partners and managed service providers
integrate with organizations’ business processes and infrastructure.
This activity has affected cloud hosting121 and accounting software
providers,122 as examples, leading to the disruption of operations for their
global, corporate customer base. Cyberthreat actors, especially those
who are part of politically motivated groups, appear to be exploiting this
interconnectivity during their campaigns. While we observe cybercriminal
chatter on underground forums concerning supply chains has been
infrequent, extortive attacks in 2018 and 2019 demonstrate the appetite
financially motivated groups have for targeting integral third parties most
likely to cause significant disruption and damage if they are breached.123

TOP-LINE ASSESSMENT: KEY JUDGMENTS
• Supply chain and third-party compromises are likely to continue,
especially as part of politically motivated campaigns.
• The rapidly changing geopolitical landscape can influence supply
chain risks.
• The effect of cyberthreats on supply chain management, third-party risk,
and merger and acquisition functions necessitates that organizations
employ proactive, intelligence-driven approaches to cyberdefense.
BACKGROUND
Cyberthreat actors have identified supply chains as an effective means to
infiltrate victim organizations. Even in industries like aerospace and defense
in which most companies have adopted mature security hygiene practices
or in which the regulatory landscape has forced such adoption, supply
chains still present risks. The breadth of the supply chain threat is larger
than information and communications technology and extends beyond
network-delivered cyberattacks on information and information systems.
Technical analyses such as MITRE’s “Deliver Uncompromised: A Strategy
for Supply Chain Security and Resilience in Response to the Changing
Character of War”124 have also drawn attention to the issue of adversarial
targeting of supply chains by stating that most nation-states and advanced
criminal groups have a full complement of technologies and resources
available to achieve their asymmetric strategies and goals as they relate
to cyberespionage and cybercrime. They usually take advantage of the

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 67

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

inherent vulnerabilities in complex supply chain ecosystems, especially
the lack of oversight associated with operational security and siloed threat
intelligence sharing. These vulnerabilities could include everything from
patch management to employee education and awareness. Accenture
iDefense anticipates that this practice will increase as supply chains and
third parties remain rich targets for intellectual property theft, initial
access, fraud, disruption and other malicious activity.
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED SUPPLY CHAIN COMPROMISES CONTINUE
Supply chains have been seen to become the preferred targets of
politically motivated threat groups as they represent the lowest hanging
fruit when threat actors consider compromising mature targets. Of the
many advantages supply chains as targets offer to an adversary, two of the
major benefits include the fact that smaller organizations within a supply
chain often have less-robust or even non-existent cybersecurity defenses
and, second, the fact that these organizations usually offer a networked
connection to their customers via supplier portals, shared networks or
trusted relationships between employees. If an adversary can exploit a
member of the supply chain, the potential exists to advance from the
supplier’s network to that of the intended target.
Software supply chain compromise has remained a popular initial access125
technique that suspected nation-state adversaries have used in 2019.
This is exemplified by Operation ShadowHammer,126 disclosed in March
2019, which involved the compromise of update software produced
by a Taiwan-based company. Accenture iDefense analysis of the TTPs
used in this supply chain compromise incident showed that its modular

Supply Chain Incident.” March 28, 2019. IntelGraph reporting.

68 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

backdoor known as ShadowHammer shared traits with ShadowPad,127
the malware family used in a similarly-styled 2017 attack against various
software products that South Korean-based NetSarang produced. The
Taiwan-based company was one of the targets of another supply chain
compromise incident that security research firm Morphisec disclosed in
2017 and that affected a widely-used computer utility tool.128 Accenture
iDefense attributes each of these incidents with moderate confidence
to what it calls the PIGFISH (also known as APT17 and Barium)129 threat
group, which was also allegedly behind an attack against several East
Asian gaming and interactive media companies disclosed in March 2019.130
During this incident, threat actors likely stole digital certificates from victim
organizations to digitally sign malware used in future intrusion operations,
possibly including Operation ShadowHammer. The consistent use of such
code-signing131 techniques to evade network defense controls by signing
malicious binaries with legitimate, stolen digital certificates is a major
concern, as it erodes the trust and integrity that organizations place in
automated update software that third-party vendors provide.
In both the ShadowPad and ShadowHammer incidents, threat actors
appear to have set up command-and-control (C2) infrastructure for a
period of approximately six months. This may be indicative of the total
dwell time during which the threat actors had access to compromised
systems. Based on historical observations that Accenture iDefense made
as they relate to this threat group, PIGFISH actors appear to be focused

on compromising entire supply chains and their proprietary technologies
rather than targeting individual organizations. This focus may reflect
an operational cadence whereby this adversary uses each sustained
supply chain compromise incident as a jumping point for subsequent
opportunities to conduct politically motivated attacks against specific
targets to fulfill broad collection requirements.
Another suspected state-sponsored threat group that previously conducted
supply chain compromises is BLACK GHOST KNIFEFISH (also known as
Dragonfly),132 which appears to be active again this year. Accenture iDefense
analysts discovered what appears to be a new sample of the custom
Heriplor133 backdoor Trojan in April 2019. This threat group gained substantial
notoriety in July 2017 when details emerged about sustained targeting of
organizations operating in the energy and manufacturing verticals based
in North America and Western Europe.134 US government officials dubbed
this campaign “Palmetto Fusion.”135 As Accenture iDefense previously
detailed in the Accenture Cyber Threatscape Report 2018,136 in 2014 BLACK
GHOST KNIFEFISH actors successfully compromised software that three ICS
equipment providers located in Central and Western Europe produced.
Based on these observations, Accenture iDefense asserts with moderate
confidence that sophisticated cyberactors could continue to use supply
chain compromise as an initial access technique, specifically as it relates to
infecting legitimate software with malicious code.

THE UNDERGROUND MARKET FOR SUPPLY CHAIN COMPROMISE
To date, Accenture iDefense has observed few illicit products and
services affecting supply chain resources on underground forums and
marketplaces, which Accenture iDefense assesses is primarily due to an
overall lack of technical expertise on the part of financially motivated threat
actors. While there is a large supply of purportedly compromised corporate
network access points in the underground representing various industries,
threat actors selling network access frequently indicate that they are doing
so either because they do not know how to monetize access or because the
nature of the content on the networks is not of interest to them. Access is
frequently sold through auctions, with specified purchasing prices. Despite
the large number of auctions, the demand for access to such networks
appears to be quite low.
Since the beginning of 2018, Accenture iDefense has observed a small
supply of goods relating to the production and maintenance of ATMs that
could potentially result in “jackpotting,” which are attacks that force the
machines to dispense cash. These goods may also enable threat actors
to research vulnerabilities and subsequently create exploits for ATMs;
one example appeared in an advertisement posted to an underground
marketplace in August 2018. In this case, an actor advertised disk images,
schematics and documentation for specific ATM brands.137 At the time, the
actor offered to sell the materials for 1 bitcoin (BTC) (approximately US$7,630
as of August 2, 2018). The buyer could potentially use the products to create
staging environments for testing purposes and exploit development.
Aside from a small market for products and services relating to ATM
manufacturing and maintenance, Accenture iDefense has observed few

advertisements of supply chain vulnerabilities on underground forums
and marketplaces. Marketing valuable vulnerabilities would likely result in
detection by law enforcement and security researchers who would then alert
the affected organization(s). As a result, transactions for such vulnerabilities
are likely to occur out of view of underground website users and instead on
closed communication platforms.
Even though valuable vulnerabilities that may result in a supply chain
compromise are not frequently advertised, Accenture iDefense analysts
have tracked a notable actor advertising source code for multiple products
of an international security solutions provider.138 The actor primarily sells
code for a platform that offers to help organizations by securely connecting
a variety of network types, IoT devices, mobile devices, industrial control
networks including sensors, supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA), and human machine interfaces (HMIs) over public and other
untrusted networks and communication channels.139 The actor claims to
have analyzed the source code and determined the technologies that
can be leveraged to exploit the platform, and stated that companies in
numerous sectors, including the government and critical infrastructure
sectors, use the products. As the technologies are supposedly vulnerable
to exploitation, an interested party could easily use the source code
to compromise organizations and any system or network built on the
advertised platform. Accenture iDefense has seen multiple follow-up
responses from the actor on a popular underground website. Initially, the
actor sought 13 BTC (approximately US$95,000 at the time of the posting)
for the code dump.140

The specific cases highlighted above are the rare ones in which financially
driven threat actors have advertised products that could result in supply
chain compromise with proper exploitation. Accenture iDefense has found
that supply chain vulnerabilities advertised on underground forums and
marketplaces primarily affect the financial services industry. The supply of
such vulnerabilities in the underground exceeds the demand, possibly due
to the advanced technical knowledge required to exploit affected systems
and monetize access. Threat actors are frequently hesitant to disclose
details of supply chain vulnerabilities on readily accessible underground
websites to avoid alerting law enforcement or security researchers.
GEOPOLITICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN FRENEMIES
The effect of geopolitical risks on businesses, especially global technology
companies, has been severe in 2018 and 2019.141 These organizations are
facing ever-more-complex threats to their supply chains, a result of having
products and services spread across every corner of the world. Companies,
no matter their sizes, should factor in geopolitical risks in business decision
making, due partly to the global nature of modern supply chains.
Although organizations may avoid business disruptions by familiarizing
themselves with local regulations and complying with local laws in each
country where they operate or have business partners, an understanding
of the political factors underlying official policies in host and partner
countries can also help companies avoid damaging their international
relationships. Meanwhile, as cyberthreats vary by country, threat actors
may seek advantage in evolving geopolitical contexts, such as trade
conflicts and global power shifts, by manipulating an organization’s supply

of products or services to compromise a networked environment. Actively
developing situational awareness and setting up effective warning systems
can help businesses assess their threat landscapes, establish protocols and
craft response plans to specific conditions ahead of time.
The modern interdependent and interconnected global economy has
resulted in a complex supply chain for most businesses but has also
created a supply chain “frenemy network” through which businesses must
maneuver, as business partners and suppliers can be both trusted and
untrusted. For example, a company that is a key provider in the supply
chain of one product may compete in another area with the same company
to which it is a supplier. Threats could arise from this partner-competitor
relationship due to escalating market competition or conflicts resulting
from different cultural understandings of business practices. Organizations
need to understand suppliers’ cybersecurity practices, such as whether
they patch emerging vulnerabilities in a timely manner, as well as new
products and innovations that they are developing. Operating wisely with
“frenemies” to reduce supply chain risks is an important factor in the
success of an international business.
PROACTIVE DEFENSE: LEVERAGING CYBERTHREAT INTELLIGENCE TO
PROTECT SUPPLY CHAINS
When trying to proactively and properly combat threats to supply chains,
organizations should integrate cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) into their
security postures and interweave CTI from external sources with internal data
and analysis. This interweaving can provide a full appreciation of the risks
associated with leveraging a supply chain and enable enhanced situational
awareness for decision makers and operators involved in daily operations
and strategic initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions (M&As).

74 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

Successfully leveraging actionable CTI is one of the most important
countermeasures an organization can employ when attempting to reduce
the likelihood of an adversary leveraging its supply chain as an exploit
vector. Successfully leveraging actionable CTI can help an organization
identify which members of its supply chain represent the highest criticality
or risk of compromise and institute the right types of defenses to help
reduce this threat, even if that organization lacks the ability to institute
critical changes directly on a supplier’s network.
When employing CTI to protect a supply chain, an organization should
seek to understand the historical threats posed by its unique ecosystem
of suppliers. For instance, enumerating the individual threat groups that
previously targeted these suppliers could help an organization to better
understand the TTPs likely still in use by these particular adversaries.
Organizations may also consider surveying the cybersecurity policies
of their supply chain providers to evaluate risk. Armed with this data, an
organization can deploy defenses to help detect and prevent activity
associated with specific tools these threat groups used as they attempted
to jump across networks and exploit trusted relationships. This intelligence
can be directly passed to members of the supply chain to show them how
they may be attacked in the future.
An organization can also gather CTI by monitoring adversaries’ actions
and communications online; doing so may help give those companies
knowledge of upcoming threat actor campaigns that may affect the
organizations themselves or their supply-chain vendors.
INTEGRATING CTI WITH MERGER AND ACQUISITION PURSUITS
M&As present unique challenges related to politically motivated
cyberthreat campaigns and cybercrime because one of the entities in an
M&A could run the risk of inheriting current and future vulnerabilities and

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 75

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

risks associated with the other party. If one of the entities is unknowingly
a victim of a previous compromise, once merged, the adversary could
potentially inherit a new victim as well. There are several critical moments
during the M&A process when CTI should be at the forefront of any
organization. These moments occur before, during and following any
merger or acquisition.
Prior to merger or acquisition
An organization should seek to understand as fully as possible the historical
threats posed to the target of a merger or acquisition. As most M&As are
initially kept private because of legal and other requirements, this step
could prove difficult; however, companies should view it as a priority. The
acquiring organization should collect and analyze as much data as possible
to determine if threat actors have in the past targeted the organization
to be acquired and if the acquiring organization could become a target
in the future because of the acquisition. If CTI indicates that threat
actors have targeted the acquired organization in the past, the acquiring
organization should seek complete situational awareness as to which
threat group(s) carried out the attacks, the TTPs those groups leverage,
and any harvestable and actionable technical indicators from those attacks
to conduct a proper investigation of the acquired organization’s network,
when the time is right to do so. If CTI indicates that the organization to be
acquired has not yet been targeted, the acquiring organization should still
determine if the acquired organization falls within the known collection
requirements of any threat groups. From a tactical perspective, CTI should
identify actual technologies, programs and other forms of intellectual
property that compromise these intelligence requirements. By compiling
a list of the high-value programs and technologies for each M&A target,
the acquiring organization can decide if any of them are known to be of
interest to an adversarial threat group.

76 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

During and after a merger or acquisition
During and after any M&A activity, CTI should play an integral role in aiding
senior-level decision makers as they make current and future business
decisions; help network defenders at all levels proactively mitigate future
campaigns; and detect any current suspicious activity. For example, CTI
should help C-suite executives understand where fresh vulnerabilities exist
because of newly acquired high-value programs, technologies, intellectual
property or PII that may currently lack proper protection against future
cyberthreat targeting.
Technical CTI should provide organizations with high confidence and
actionable indicators that cyberdefense operators can use both to alert
for suspicious traffic post-merger or acquisition, and to leverage when
performing incident response investigations, if the merged networks show
signs of compromise. This technical CTI should provide enough context to
give merging organizations immediate and complete situational awareness
of TTPs and even attribution, if possible.
Cloud security strategy
For many organizations, cloud environments generally provide greater
security than local solutions would. However, cyberthreat actors have
begun to turn their focus toward cloud environments, seeing them as
target-rich. Cloud service provider (CSP) and managed service provider
(MSP) compromises have given cyberthreat actors unauthorized access
to sensitive information across numerous industries.142 Companies rely on
vendor support to secure cloud storage and release critical vulnerability
patches, but still need to implement their own security controls. US
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reporting warned organizations

in spring 2019 of decreased security postures when using popular cloudbased office applications.143 The reporting noted that compromised
organizations did not have designated IT cloud security teams and
recommended that organizations set up company cloud strategies as a
necessary step in reducing corporate vulnerabilities. The recommended
company strategies include multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect
against O365 credential theft, disabling of legacy e-mail protocols and
configuring of network management password synchronizing.144
Vendor device testing
Security testing is a crucial part of the technology development and
acquisition process. This testing can be especially daunting for large
firms as they harmonize a diverse suite of technologies to optimize
business operations. Continuous monitoring of cyberthreats to software,
firmware and hardware can enable organizations to be proactive and
efficient with their allocation of resources to the in-depth vetting of thirdparty technologies.
A factory acceptance test (FAT), also known as a vendor accepted test
(VAT), involves a manufacturer testing devices in simulated environments
prior to client deployment and installation.145 A FAT evaluates a device’s
compatibility with client specifications, validates the quality of a tested
device and ensures seamless integration into a client’s operational
technology (OT) environment. FATs are usually conducted during the first
installation of significant upgrades or when switching to a new vendor
but are often overlooked when repurchasing from a trusted vendor,

which presents an opening for malicious actors. Trusted vendors are
just as susceptible to vulnerabilities, and their devices should be tested
for firmware misconfigurations or malware. To further confirm device
integration into an environment, a site acceptance test (SAT) occurs at the
client site after a FAT. For smaller organizations that cannot afford the use
of an on-site simulated testing environment, a third-party test lab is suitable
for conducting SATs.
Third-party risk assessments and contracts
Case study: How Financial Services are responding to third-party risk
In the financial services industry, authoritative bodies, including the
European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)—the European Banking Authority
(EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)—are continuing
to emphasize third-party cyber risks. The ESAs have proposed a legislative
framework to monitor the resilience of critical service providers, and
in the interim, firms are encouraged to leverage threat-intelligence-led
cyberresilience testing to understand their attack surfaces.146

In 2019, industry-focused guidance from United States regulators has
shed light on the risk third parties pose to critical infrastructure sectors,
including the oil and gas, and financial services sectors. North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection
(CIP) 013‑1, titled “CyberSecurity Supply Chain Risk Management,”
requires vendors to notify electric utility customers of known product
vulnerabilities. 149 Previously, vendors were not obligated to disclose
exploits; as a result, critical devices would remain unpatched. As electric
utilities continue to implement standards to ensure grid resiliency and
security, other critical infrastructure sectors continue their standards
development work. Operational Technology (OT) environments in the
oil and gas, and chemicals industries are considered to be particularly
vulnerable during this standards development phase.
An alternative for industries lacking finalized standards to help mitigate
supply chain and third-party risks is to consider including in their software
and hardware vendor agreements a requirement to disclose known
vulnerabilities. In addition to government regulations, where they exist,
information sharing and strengthened third-party relationships could
help to reduce cyberthreat vulnerabilities throughout the supply chain.
In addition to contracts, companies may wish to conduct third-party risk
assessments. Additionally, the risk of a potential third-party cyberattack
should be calculated into companies’ standard risk management process.

SUMMARY
The global interconnectedness of business, and the broadening
adoption of traditional industry cyberthreat countermeasures and basic
cybersecurity hygiene push cyberthreat actors to seek new avenues to
compromise targets such as supply chains, including those for software,
hardware and cloud. As a component of routine operations, organizations
should seek full awareness of their threat profiles and points of supply
chain vulnerability.
By integrating cyberthreat intelligence into M&As and other strategically
important actions, incorporating vendor and factory testing, and
implementing industry-focused regulations and risk assessment standards,
organizations can grow mature processes to guard against the cybersecurity
risks inherent in the landscape of modern global business operations.

LIFE AFTER MELTDOWN: VULNERABILITIES
IN COMPUTER CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE
DEMAND COSTLY SOLUTIONS

OVERVIEW
It is estimated that 83 percent of enterprise workloads will move to
the cloud by the year 2020.150 This race to the cloud has prompted
security researchers and adversaries to look for vulnerabilities in the
cloud infrastructure, leading to the discovery of multiple side-channel
vulnerabilities in modern CPUs over the last two years. These sophisticated
CPU vulnerabilities, affecting both server and workstation CPUs, pose a
high risk to organizations running their compute infrastructure in the public
cloud. Adversaries can use this class of side-channel vulnerabilities to read
sensitive data from other hosts on the same physical server.
TOP-LINE ASSESSMENT: KEY JUDGMENTS
• Multi-tenant public cloud providers are ideal targets for exploitation of
side-channel CPU vulnerabilities, which can be exploited, for example,
to read data from other hosts on the same physical server.
• Mitigations are available for most platforms, cloud deployments, and
software. However, most of the mitigations come at a cost of reduced
performance, leading to increase of compute costs for most enterprises.
• Understanding the threats posed by CPU vulnerabilities is important to
design a proper risk mitigation strategy, which can be vastly different
for each organization.

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Since January 2018, computer hardware security researchers have
disclosed multiple vulnerabilities in microprocessors. The discovery
and disclosure of these vulnerabilities, broadly classified as Spectre and
Meltdown,151 have broken down the assumptions of hardware security and
the threat models associated with computer processor hardware and have
brought back microprocessor security research into the foreground.
By November 2018, security researchers had found and disclosed
multiple new variants of Meltdown and new attack techniques for Spectre
vulnerabilities. In May of 2019, security researchers disclosed four new sidechannel information disclosure vulnerabilities which affect Intel processors.
These vulnerabilities are popularly referred to as Zombieload, RIDL and
Fallout.152 Due to the amount of interest received, it is likely that additional
variants and vulnerabilities are currently being investigated at this time.
TRANSIENT EXECUTION SIDE CHANNEL ATTACKS
Modern microprocessors attempt to increase the number of instructions
which can be executed in parallel to boost their performance. One method
of increasing the processor’s throughput is to execute instructions which
are likely to be executed soon, prior to the instruction being requested.
To achieve this, processors predict or “speculate” possible “future values.”
Based on speculation, the processor executes ahead of time and keeps the
results of such yet-to-be-executed instructions transiently. If the processor
predicts correctly, when the “speculated group of instructions” arrive, the
processor already has all the computed results ready, resulting in higher
performance. However, if the processor speculated incorrectly, the results
are discarded.

RIDL and Fallout.” May 15, 2019. IntelGraph reporting.

84 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

Security researchers have now found that even though the processor
discards the results of incorrectly speculated instructions, there are
indirect means (side-channels) of gaining information about the transient
results. This information disclosure has resulted in vulnerabilities like
Spectre, Meltdown, Foreshadow and other related variants.
Most of the affected hypervisors, operating systems, and hardware
vendors have released patches, mitigations, and defenses to tackle the
multitude of speculative execution issues that have been brought to light
in the past two years.
RISK OVERVIEW
The side-channel vulnerabilities affect most modern microprocessors,
servers and workstations alike. However, the largest risk occurs in
one major class of services—cloud computing. Typically, public cloud
computing services have multiple tenants sharing compute instances
on the same physical hardware. In this multi-tenant architecture, each
tenant’s data is supposed to be completely isolated and secured from
the other tenants. A multi-tenant architecture which uses processors that
are vulnerable to side-channel attacks can be exploited by a malicious
co‑tenant to extract information from another tenant’s instance.
MITIGATIONS
Cloud deployments
Organizations that want to try and minimize the risks associated with the
exploitation of these vulnerabilities should consider using a single-tenant
dedicated host cloud environments. Single-tenant environments provide
a more isolated hardware environment while enabling the flexibility of a
cloud deployment.

2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT > 85

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Popular cloud providers provide the option to use dedicated physical
hardware resources, minimizing the risk of cross-container or sharedhardware-host attacks (see Figure 14). It is important for customers to read
the fine print of the cloud service, as the implementation may vary between
vendors. For example, Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers a dedicated
instances option such that each instance runs in a virtual private cloud on
hardware that is dedicated to a single customer or account. Although this
ensures total physical isolation, the catch is that the dedicated instances
may share the same underlying physical hardware with non-dedicated
instances deployed from the same account. This is particularly important
to consider in the case of a single account running a multi-tier application
with components running on both dedicated and non-dedicated instances.

Finally, organizations that are extremely risk averse can choose to have an
on-premises cloud. This vastly reduces the risk and enables the organization
to accept some management overhead without sacrificing performance.
Private infrastructure
There are many mitigations available for organizations to remediate the risk
on privately maintained infrastructure.156 The side-channel vulnerabilities
have resulted in vendors offering mitigations at various levels of the
computing stack—processors, hypervisors, operating systems and software.
Software updates
Most operating system vendors have issued security updates to mitigate
these vulnerabilities. However, in most cases, the resulting compute
performance has been lower. In some instances, the performance
degradation has been reported to be a staggering 30 percent.157 For example,
for the Portsmash158 vulnerability, the solution is to disable simultaneous
multithreading (SMT), which can lead to degraded performance. The most
popular software patch is Google’s Retpoline,159 which prevents the processor
from speculating on the target of an indirect jump.

FIVE THREAT FACTORS

Compiler vendors have included new compiler flags which add protection
against some vulnerabilities, like Spectre.160 Newer versions of compilers
default to these flags. To take advantage of these compiler updates,
most software vendors must recompile their applications with updated
compilers. This is not always easy, as some sub-components of large
applications can still be using older libraries which are not compiled with
Spectre mitigations, thereby degrading the overall security posture of the
entire application.
New hardware
The simplest mitigation is to replace the hardware with newer hardware
which has protections built-in to address these vulnerabilities. Although the
cost of replacing hardware prematurely can be expensive, it may be worth
the investment to replace server hardware out of cycle. Updating to new
hardware does not, however, guarantee future security as new classes of
CPU vulnerabilities are found every year.
To counter this, processor vendors provide firmware updates where
possible. They also provide microcode updates to operating system
vendors, which are shipped as security updates. Microcode updates are
applied at boot-time by the operating system, which can help in patching
some of the security vulnerabilities on-the-fly. The ideal way to deal with
this risk to apply mitigations at all possible levels of the compute stack—
hardware and software.

Risk acceptance
The cloud compute architecture has changed the way organizations have
assumed risk. In most cases, an organization runs compute instances in a
multi-tenant cloud and has best practices in place to minimize risk for cost
savings. This approach can work well, especially for smaller organizations,
when the compute data is less sensitive.
However, for organizations that prefer to have complete control over the
compute resources, some amount of risk acceptance can help realize
some of the costs of having an on-premises cloud. With a vastly different
threat model, an organization with an on-premises cloud solution can
choose to not apply the mitigations which may heavily degrade application
performance. A hybrid solution which uses on-premises cloud for sensitive
data and the public cloud for non-sensitive data can also be a solution for
some organizations.
SUMMARY
No two organizations have the same needs. Performing a careful analysis
of business objectives, security and growth strategy is necessary before
architecting and managing a cloud solution.

A SECURITY PIVOT
Cybercrime is not a one-time event. Just as one avenue of income has
been blocked, cybercriminals will swiftly move on to another, often more
sophisticated means of entry. And even tried and tested methods of
attack, such as ransomware, can be subject to change, as threat actors
apply the principles but interpret the execution in new and different ways.
Today, organizations must not only take on the disruptive forces that
are changing their industries with speed, confidence and continuous
innovation, but also remember their most important currency—trust.
Security is front and center of maintaining that trust, but with new threats
constantly emerging, it is being sorely tested.
In summary:
• Communications targeting global stage may not be all they
seem. Advances in technologies, such as artificial intelligence
and 5G communications, along with social media and other fast
communications channels, are providing a new, easy gateway to
influencing and impacting the geopolitical landscape. Organizations
should be vigilant and prepare for the fact that world events are often
a target, with phishing lures or distractions taking advantage of and
being used to influence outcomes.
• Cybercriminals are shifting—and so should you. Conventional
cybercrime operations continue to happen, but they are also evolving.
Close-knit syndicates are favored alongside localized underground
economies, especially in non-English-speaking countries. New TTPs,
such as “big game hunting” and hack ’n’ hustle network access
intrusions are on the increase. Established attack methods, such
as using commodity malware, emphasize how important it is for
organizations to stay one step ahead of the cyberattackers.

90 > 2019 CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT

• The mixed motives behind ransomware are making it more
destructive. The consequences of ransomware can be far more
than financial—significant disruption to business operations, and a
high cost to repair or restore systems, are part of the ransomware
experience, not to mention the impact on business brand, culture and
trust. There is no guarantee that paying a ransom will restore lost data.
• This is no time for splendid isolation—your ecosystem needs you.
Threat actors continue to favor creating third-party compromises,
especially as part of politically motivated campaigns. The effect of
cyberthreats on supply chain management, third-party risk, and
merger and acquisition functions means organizations should employ
proactive, intelligence-driven approaches to cyberdefense.
• Beware of opening more than the back door. The potential for
exploitation of side-channel CPU vulnerabilities so that data can be
read from other hosts on the same physical server appear to make
multi-tenant public cloud services an ideal target. And mitigations
come at a cost—reduced performance that leads to an increase
of compute costs for most enterprises. Designing a risk mitigation
strategy can be vastly different for every organization.
Organizations should tackle cyberresilience with a security pivot mind‑set.
They should learn not to dwell on the vulnerabilities of the past and be
consistent but flexible in their defense. They should look at security with a
wide lens, to include the vulnerabilities of partners and third parties in the
scope of their cyberstrategies. And they should learn to make a security
pivot, adapting their approach to meet the latest demands from a rapidly
changing world.

ABOUT THE REPORT
The Cyber Threatscape Report 2019 presents key findings from Accenture
iDefense threat intelligence research into significant cyberthreat trends.
This report covers cyberthreat trends the Accenture iDefense threat
intelligence team has observed and analyzed from January 2019 until July
2019. It provides an overview of the trends and how Accenture iDefense
threat intelligence believes they might evolve and grow throughout the
year ahead.
This report should serve as a reference and strategic complement to daily
intelligence reporting to provide IT security and business operations with
actionable and relevant decision support based on Accenture iDefense
threat intelligence. It aims to inform IT security teams, business operations
teams, and organizations’ leadership about emerging cyber trends and
threats, to help those groups anticipate key cybersecurity developments
for the remainder of the 2019 calendar year (and in some cases beyond),
and to provide, where appropriate, solutions to help reduce organizations’
risk research using primary and secondary open-source material.
Accenture iDefense threat intelligence has been creating relevant, timely
and actionable threat intelligence for 20 years, by collecting threat data,
indicators of compromise, geopolitical-based, regional-based, and industry
vertical-based intelligence. Our team was built to help provide our clients
with actionable and relevant threat intelligence that they use to support
decisions that help them enhance their security teams, defend their
networks, and bolster their security technology investments, their security
processes and their business strategy.
The following table defines malware, threat groups, exploit kits and
vulnerabilities listed throughout the report.
