DoD CIO
SUBJECT:

Cybersecurity

References: See Enclosure 1

1. PURPOSE. This instruction:
a. Reissues and renames DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.01E (Reference (a)) as a DoD
Instruction (DoDI) pursuant to the authority in DoDD 5144.02 (Reference (b)) to establish a
DoD cybersecurity program to protect and defend DoD information and information technology
(IT).
b. Incorporates and cancels DoDI 8500.02 (Reference (c)), DoDD C-5200.19 (Reference
(d)), DoDI 8552.01 (Reference (e)), Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and
Information Integration (ASD(NII))/DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) Memorandums
(References (f) through (k)), and Directive-type Memorandum (DTM) 08-060 (Reference (l)).
c. Establishes the positions of DoD principal authorizing official (PAO) (formerly known as
principal accrediting authority) and the DoD Senior Information Security Officer (SISO)
(formerly known as the Senior Information Assurance Officer) and continues the DoD
Information Security Risk Management Committee (DoD ISRMC) (formerly known as the
Defense Information Systems Network (DISN)/Global Information Grid (GIG) Flag Panel).
d. Adopts the term “cybersecurity” as it is defined in National Security Presidential
Directive-54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive-23 (Reference (m)) to be used throughout
DoD instead of the term “information assurance (IA).”

2. APPLICABILITY
a. This instruction applies to:
(1) OSD, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff (CJCS) and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General
of the DoD, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities
within the DoD (referred to collectively in this instruction as the “DoD Components”).

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

(2) All DoD IT.
(3) All DoD information in electronic format.
(4) Special access program (SAP) information technology, other than SAP ISs handling
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) material.
b. Nothing in this instruction alters or supersedes the existing authorities and policies of the
Director of National Intelligence (DNI) regarding the protection of SCI as directed by Executive
Order 12333 (Reference (n)) and other laws and regulations.

3. POLICY. It is DoD policy that:
a. Risk Management
(1) DoD will implement a multi-tiered cybersecurity risk management process to protect
U.S. interests, DoD operational capabilities, and DoD individuals, organizations, and assets from
the DoD Information Enterprise level, through the DoD Component level, down to the IS level
as described in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-39 (Reference (o)) and Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy (CNSSP)
22 (Reference (p)).
(2) Risks associated with vulnerabilities inherent in IT, global sourcing and distribution,
and adversary threats to DoD use of cyberspace must be considered in DoD employment of
capabilities to achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations.
(3) All DoD IT will be assigned to, and governed by, a DoD Component cybersecurity
program that manages risk commensurate with the importance of supported missions and the
value of potentially affected information or assets.
(4) Risk management will be addressed as early as possible in the acquisition of IT and
in an integrated manner across the IT life cycle.
(5) Documentation regarding the security posture of DoD IS and PIT systems will be
made available to promote reciprocity as described in DoDI 8510.01 (Reference (q)) and to assist
authorizing officials (AOs) (formerly known as designated approving or accrediting authorities)
from other organizations in making credible, risk-based decisions regarding the acceptance and
use of systems and the information that they process, store, or transmit.
b. Operational Resilience. DoD IT will be planned, developed, tested, implemented,
evaluated, and operated to ensure that:
(1) Information and services are available to authorized users whenever and wherever
required according to mission needs, priorities, and changing roles and responsibilities.

2

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

(2) Security posture, from individual device or software object to aggregated systems of
systems, is sensed, correlated, and made visible to mission owners, network operators, and to the
DoD Information Enterprise consistent with DoDD 8000.01 (Reference (r)).
(3) Whenever possible, technology components (e.g., hardware and software) have the
ability to reconfigure, optimize, self-defend, and recover with little or no human intervention.
Attempts made to reconfigure, self-defend, and recover should produce an incident audit trail.
c. Integration and Interoperability
(1) Cybersecurity must be fully integrated into system life cycles and will be a visible
element of organizational, joint, and DoD Component IT portfolios.
(2) Interoperability will be achieved through adherence to DoD architecture principles,
adopting a standards-based approach, and by all DoD Components sharing the level of risk
necessary to achieve mission success.
(3) All interconnections of DoD IT will be managed to minimize shared risk by ensuring
that the security posture of one system is not undermined by vulnerabilities of interconnected
systems.
d. Cyberspace Defense. Cyberspace defense will be employed to protect, detect,
characterize, counter, and mitigate unauthorized activity and vulnerabilities on DoD information
networks. Cyberspace defense information will be shared with all appropriately cleared and
authorized personnel in support of DoD enterprise-wide situational awareness.
e. Performance
(1) Implementation of cybersecurity will be overseen and governed through the
integrated decision structures and processes described in this instruction.
(2) Performance will be measured, assessed for effectiveness, and managed relative to
contributions to mission outcomes and strategic goals and objectives, in accordance with
Sections 11103 and 11313 of Title 40, United States Code (U.S.C.) (Reference (s)).
(3) Data will be collected to support reporting and cybersecurity management activities
across the system life cycle.
(4) Standardized IT tools, methods, and processes will be used to the greatest extent
possible to eliminate duplicate costs and to focus resources on creating technologically mature
and verified solutions.
f. DoD Information. All DoD information in electronic format will be given an appropriate
level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability that reflects the importance of both information
sharing and protection.

3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

g. Identity Assurance
(1) Identity assurance must be used to ensure strong identification, authentication, and
eliminate anonymity in DoD IS and PIT systems.
(2) DoD will public key-enable DoD ISs and implement a DoD-wide Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) solution that will be managed by the DoD PKI Program Management Office
in accordance with DoDI 8520.02 (Reference (t)).
(3) Biometrics used in support of identity assurance will be managed in accordance with
DoDD 8521.01 (Reference (u)).
h. Information Technology
(1) All IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, or transmits DoD information will be
acquired, configured, operated, maintained, and disposed of consistent with applicable DoD
cybersecurity policies, standards, and architectures.
(2) Risks associated with global sourcing and distribution, weaknesses or flaws inherent
in the IT, and vulnerabilities introduced through faulty design, configuration, or use will be
managed, mitigated, and monitored as appropriate.
(3) Cybersecurity requirements must be identified and included throughout the lifecycle
of systems including acquisition, design, development, developmental testing, operational
testing, integration, implementation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all DoD IT supporting
DoD tasks and missions.
i. Cybersecurity Workforce
(1) Cybersecurity workforce functions must be identified and managed, and personnel
performing cybersecurity functions will be appropriately screened in accordance with this
instruction and DoD 5200.2-R (Reference (v)), and qualified in accordance with DoDD 8570.01
(Reference (w)) and supporting issuances.
(2) Qualified cybersecurity personnel must be identified and integrated into all phases of
the system development life cycle.
j. Mission Partners
(1) Capabilities built to support cybersecurity objectives that are shared with mission
partners will be consistent with guidance contained in Reference (r) and governed through
integrated decision structures and processes described in this instruction.

4

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

the Pentagon Reservation and supported DoD facilities and space in the National Capital Region,
including the Raven Rock Mountain Complex and alternate sites.

2. RISK MANAGEMENT
a. Cybersecurity Risk Management. Managing cybersecurity risks is a complex,
multifaceted undertaking that requires the involvement of the entire organization, from senior
leaders planning and managing DoD operations, to individuals developing, implementing, and
operating the IT supporting those operations. Cybersecurity risk management is a subset of the
overall risk management process for all DoD acquisitions as defined in Reference (av), which
includes cost, performance, and schedule risk associated with the execution of all programs of
record, and all other acquisitions of DoD. The risk assessment process extends to the logistics
support of fielded equipment and the need to maintain the integrity of supply sources.

(1) DoD will use NIST SP 800-37 (Reference (ch)), as implemented by Reference (q), to
address risk management, including authorization to operate (ATO), for all DoD ISs and PIT
systems.
(2) DoD IS and PIT systems will transition to CNSSI 1253 (Reference (ci)), NIST SP
800-53 (Reference (cj)), and Reference (ch) in accordance with transition guidance provided in
Reference (q).
b. Integrated Organization-Wide Risk Management. Risk management can be viewed as a
holistic activity that is fully integrated into every aspect of the organization as described in
Reference (o). Figure 1 illustrates a three-tiered approach to risk management that addresses
risk-related concerns at the organization level, the mission and business process level, and the IS
level.

TACTICAL RISK

(1) Risk management at Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective. As
part of the feedback loop, Tier 1 risk management is informed and influenced by risk decisions
made in Tiers 2 and 3.
(a) A comprehensive IS security governance structure is established that provides
assurance that IS security strategies are aligned with and support mission and business
objectives, are consistent with applicable laws and regulations through adherence to policies and
internal controls, and provide assignment of responsibility.
(b) The DoD ISRMC, comprising the four MA PAOs and other major DoD and IC
stakeholders, provides the Tier 1 risk management governance for DoD.
28

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

(2) Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective and is guided
by the risk decisions at Tier 1, and informed and influenced by risk decisions made in Tier 3.
(a) The activities at Tier 2 begin with the design, development, and implementation
of the mission and business processes defined at Tier 1.
(b) The PAOs for each DoD MA provide the Tier 2 governance for their respective
MAs.
(3) Tier 3 addresses risk from an IS and PIT system perspective and is guided by the risk
decisions at Tiers 1 and 2.
(a) Though the need for specific protections is identified at Tiers 1 and 2, it is at Tier
3 where the information protections are applied to the system and its environment of operation
for the benefit of successfully enabling mission and business success.
(b) Information protection requirements are satisfied by the selection and
implementation of appropriate security controls in Reference (cj). Security controls are
implemented at Tier 3 by common control providers, system managers (SMs), or PMs, and riskbased authorization decisions are granted by AOs.
c. Risk Management in the System Development Life Cycle
(1) Risk management tasks begin early in the system development life cycle and are
important in shaping the security capabilities of the IS. If these tasks are not adequately
performed during the initiation, development, and acquisition phases of the system development
life cycle, the tasks will, by necessity, be undertaken later in the life cycle and will be more
costly and time consuming to implement, and could negatively impact the performance of the IS.
(2) Cybersecurity risk management is planned for and documented in a cybersecurity
strategy (formerly known as IA strategy) in accordance with References (at) and (av), and
included in the PPP for all acquisition programs. Periodic reviews of the PPP and associated
systems engineering documents should evaluate the status of cybersecurity solutions as part of
the larger systems development.
(3) Risk management must continue during operations and sustainment. This may
include the application of new or revised security controls prior to the integration of new IT
services or products into an existing operational IS in order to maintain the security of the
operational IS.
d. DoD ISRMC. The DoD ISRMC, supported by the DSAWG, is the DoD risk executive
function as described in References (o) and (ch).
e. Risk Management Framework (RMF). DoD uses Reference (ch) as implemented by
Reference (q), and is applicable to all DoD ISs and PIT systems. The RMF provides a
disciplined and structured process that combines IS security and risk management activities into
29

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
the system development life cycle and authorizes their use within DoD. The RMF has six steps:
categorize system; select security controls; implement security controls; assess security controls;
authorize system; and monitor security controls.
f. Risk Assessment. Risk assessment is a key step in the organizational risk management
process. Risk assessments will be performed in accordance with the process in Reference (cf)
and as described on the Knowledge Service (KS) (i.e., recommending preferred risk assessment
approaches and analysis approaches). In particular, all of the risk factors described in Reference
(cf) must be used across components and agencies of the DoD to ensure reciprocity and ease of
sharing risk information. The robustness of the risk assessments may be tailored to
accommodate resource constraints and the availability of detailed risk factor information (e.g.,
threat data); however, any tailoring must be clearly explained in risk assessment reports to ensure
that AOs understand to what degree they can rely on the results of the risk assessments.
g. Security Controls. Security controls are expressed in a specified format (e.g., a control
number, a control name, control text, and enhancement text).
(1) All DoD IS and PIT systems will be categorized in accordance with Reference (ci)
and will implement a corresponding set of security controls that are published in Reference (cj)
regardless of whether they are National Security System (NSS) or non-NSS.
(2) All security controls used by DoD are published in the security control catalog in
Reference (cj), with supporting validation procedures in NIST 800-53A (Reference (ck)).
(3) DoD-specific assignment values, implementation guidance, and validation
procedures will be developed by the DoD CIO with direct support from NSA/CSS and DISA and
input from the other DoD Components and will be published in the KS at
https://diacap.iaportal.navy.mil.
(4) The DoD CIO, with direct support from NSA/CSS and DISA, and input from the
other DoD Components, works with NIST to ensure that the security control catalog remains upto-date and continues to represent DoD needs.
(5) Detailed guidance on DoD IS and PIT system categorization and security control
selection is provided in Reference (q).
h. Cybersecurity Reciprocity
(1) Within DoD, reciprocity has been implemented as cybersecurity reciprocity to
differentiate it from the application of reciprocity to other disciplines. Cybersecurity reciprocity
reduces time and resources wasted on redundant test, assessment and documentation efforts.
(2) Cybersecurity reciprocity is best achieved through transparency (i.e., making
sufficient evidence regarding the security posture of an IS or PIT system available, so that an AO
from another organization can use that evidence to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding
the acceptance and use of that system or the information it processes, stores, or transmits). DoD

30

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
Components must share security authorization packages with affected information owners (IOs)
or stewards and interconnected ISOs to support cybersecurity reciprocity. The reciprocal
acceptance of DoD and other federal agency and department security authorizations will be
implemented in accordance with the procedures in Reference (q).

3. OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE. Operational resilience requires three conditions to be met:
information resources are trustworthy; missions are ready for information resources degradation
or loss; and network operations have the means to prevail in the face of adverse events.
Operational resilience must be achieved by:
a. Using TSN requirements and best practices to protect mission-critical functions and
components and manage risks to the integrity of critical information and communications
technology in accordance with Reference (bm) for the sustainment of IT. This includes the use
of criticality analysis, all-source threat informed acquisition, and engineering mitigations, and the
authorities prescribed in section 806 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2011(Reference (cl)). TSN processes and best practices must be applied early and
across the system development life cycle, and be applied to system acquisitions and the purchase
and integration of replacement IT as described in Reference (bm).
b. Performing developmental T&E of cybersecurity in accordance with Reference (av) and
OT&E in accordance with References (bc) and (bd), including the ability to detect and react to
penetrations and exploitations and to protect and restore data and information, in order to inform
acquisition and fielding decisions.
c. Supporting acquisition program protection by:
(1) Ensuring cybersecurity is a key element of program protection planning activities
that manage risks to advance technology and mission-critical system functionality from foreign
collection due to design vulnerability or supply chain exploit insertion, and battlefield loss
throughout the system life cycle.
(2) Having mission criteria for identifying critical components and critical program
information as established in References (bm) and (ay).
d. Planning for mission continuation in the face of degraded or unavailable information
resources in accordance with DoDD 3020.26 (Reference (cm)), and integrating those plans and
priorities into the DoD Information Enterprise.
e. Exercising under realistic cyber conditions and testing procedures and tactics for workarounds and fall-backs in the face of hostility in accordance with Secretary of Defense
Memorandum (Reference (cn)). This includes:
(1) Conducting periodic exercises or evaluations of the ability to operate during loss of
all information resources and connectivity.

31

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
(2) Being able to allocate information resources dynamically as needed to sustain
mission operations while addressing cyber failures, no matter the cause.
(3) Being able to restore information resources rapidly to a trusted state while
maintaining support to ongoing missions.
f. Preserving the trust in the security of DoD information during transmission.
(1) Transmission of DoD information must be protected through the communications
security (COMSEC) measures and procedures established in DoDI 8523.01 (Reference (co)) and
security controls that support transmission security (TRANSEC) in Reference (cj).
(2) COMSEC monitoring and cybersecurity readiness testing will be conducted in
accordance with Reference (bn).
(3) Compromising emanations (i.e., TEMPEST) countermeasures must be applied in
accordance with policy in Reference (ca), guidance in Reference (cb), and other TEMPEST
guidance as issued by the DIRNSA/CHCSS.
g. Using automation whenever possible in support of cybersecurity objectives including, but
not limited to, secure configuration management, continuous monitoring, active cyber defense,
and incident reporting and situational awareness.

4. INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY
a. Net-Centric Operations. A net-centric model provides people, services, and platforms the
ability to discover one another and connect to form new capabilities or teams without being
constrained by geographic, organizational, or technical barriers. The net-centric model allows
people, services, and platforms to work together to achieve shared ends. To be net-centric,
cybersecurity will be designed, organized, and managed such that it can work together in any
combination that events demand and maintain an expected level of readiness so that all required
cybersecurity assets can be brought to bear in a rapid and flexible manner to meet new or
changing mission needs.
b. Integration. Cybersecurity must be fully integrated into system life cycles so that it will
be a visible element of organizational, joint, and DoD Component architectures, capability
identification and development processes, integrated testing, information technology portfolios,
acquisition, operational readiness assessments, supply chain risk management, SSE, and
operations and maintenance activities.
c. Interoperability
(1) Cybersecurity products (e.g., firewalls, file integrity checkers, virus scanners,
intrusion detection systems, anti‐malware software) should operate in a net-centric manner to
enhance the exchange of data and shared security policies.

32

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

(2) Semantic, technical, and policy interoperability will be used to integrate disparate
cybersecurity products into a net-centric enterprise that can work together to create new
intelligence and make and implement decisions at network speed.
(3) Semantic, technical, and policy interoperability support products are designed to
provide security for communications between different IT systems. Interoperable
communications must be consistent with approved cryptographic design and current system
implementation standards. The objective is to ensure the seamless and secure exchange of
classified or sensitive information that is critical to the success of DoD mission goals and
objectives.
d. Standards-Based Approach. The DoD cybersecurity and cyberspace defense data strategy
will enable semantic, technical, and policy interoperability through a standards-based approach
that has been refined by many in industry, academia, and government. It is an information‐
oriented approach (see for example the security content automation protocol (SCAP) discussion
in NIST SP 800-126 (Reference (cp)).
e. DoD Architecture Principles. Interoperability and effective management of security
content will be achieved through adherence to DoD cybersecurity architectures as issued. All
DoD Components must commit to these architectures to facilitate sharing of information
necessary to achieve mission success while managing the risk inherent in interconnecting
systems.
f. Knowledge Repositories. These contain a broad collection of best practices, benchmarks,
standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and the like. Examples
include the National Vulnerability Database (http://nvd.nist.gov/), the Open Vulnerability and
Assessment Language Repository (http://oval.mitre.org/repository), and the DoD’s KS as
defined in Reference (q). In many respects, knowledge repositories serve as the cybersecurity
and cyberspace defense community “memory” and they enable policy or process interoperability
and should be used to share information and answer questions.

5. CYBERSPACE DEFENSE. Cyberspace defense uses architectures, cybersecurity,
intelligence, counterintelligence (CI), other security programs, LE, and other military capabilities
to harden the DoD Information Enterprise to be more resistant to penetration and disruption; to
strengthen the U.S. ability to respond to unauthorized activity and defend DoD information and
networks against sophisticated and agile cyber threats; and to recover quickly from cyber
incidents.
a. Defense of DoD IT. Defense of DoD IT and information networks is under the direction
of the Commander, USSTRATCOM, in accordance with Reference (cd) and is conducted as
described in Commander, USSTRATCOM, orders or other directives such as alerts and
bulletins, Reference (bl), and DoD Manual O-8530.01 (Reference (cq)). Cyberspace defense is
integrated with other elements of network operations as described in DoDI 8410.02 (Reference
(cr)).

33

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

b. Continuous Monitoring Capability. DoD will establish and maintain a continuous
monitoring capability that provides cohesive collection, transmission, storage, aggregation, and
presentation of data that conveys current operational status to affected DoD stakeholders. DoD
Components will achieve cohesion through the use of a common continuous monitoring
framework, lexicon, and workflow as specified in NIST SP 800-137 (Reference (cs)).
c. Penetration and Exploitation Testing. Evaluation of cybersecurity during an acquisition
T&E event must include independent threat representative penetration and exploitation testing
and evaluation of the complete system cyberspace defenses including the controls and protection
provided by computer network defense service providers. Penetration and exploitation testing
must be planned and resourced as part of the DT&E and OT&E via the appropriate program test
documentation.
d. Cyber Defense Personnel. Cyber defense personnel operating on or in DoD IS will be
identified using identity authentication methods in DoDI 8520.03 (Reference (ct)).
e. LE and CI (LE/CI)
(1) The DoD Cyber Crime Center, as described in DoDD 5505.13 (Reference (cu)),
provides digital and multimedia forensics and specialized cyber investigative training and
services. In this role it coordinates and facilitates relationships across LE, intelligence, and
homeland security communities.
(2) DoD component LE/CI agencies deploy capabilities on DoD networks with the intent
to identify and investigate the human element posing a threat to DoD IT and DoD information.
Cybersecurity will be used in support of countering espionage, international terrorism, and the CI
insider threat in accordance with DoDI 5240.26 (Reference (cv)).
(3) DoD network administrators will accommodate all applicable legitimate and lawful
deployment of LE/CI tools and solutions. DoD LE/CI organizations in turn will make all
reasonable attempts to coordinate the implementation of LE/CI solutions with their respective
AO in a manner consistent with service-level change control processes in order to avoid any
disruption to mission critical operational tempo.
f. Insider Threat. Insider threats must be addressed in accordance with policy and
procedures published by the USD(P).

6. PERFORMANCE
a. Organizations will implement processes and procedures to accommodate three conditions
necessary to realize effective cybersecurity that is consistently implemented across DoD:
(1) Organization Direction. This includes organizational mechanisms for establishing
and communicating priorities and objectives, principles, policies, standards, and performance

34

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
measures.
(2) A Culture of Accountability. This includes aligning internal processes, maintaining
accountability, and informing, making, and following through on decisions with implications for
cyberspace protection and defense.
(3) Insight and Oversight. This includes measuring, reviewing, verifying, monitoring,
facilitating, and remediating to ensure coordinated and consistent cybersecurity implementation
and reporting across all organizations without impeding local missions.
b. In addition to the structures that facilitate DoD’s major decision processes (e.g., the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System described in CJCSI
3170.01 (Reference (cw)), DoDD 7045.14 (Reference (cx)), Reference (au)) cybersecurity
performance is facilitated by the DoD CIO Executive Board in accordance with the DoD CIO
Memorandum (Reference (cy)) and its supporting governance bodies (e.g., IA Senior Leadership
forum, DoD ISRMC).
c. Strategic cybersecurity metrics will be defined, collected, and reported by the DoD CIO in
partnership with the DoD Components. DoD CIO will develop and issue guidance regarding
how cybersecurity metrics are determined, established, defined, collected, and reported.

7. DoD INFORMATION
a. The DoD Information Security Program is described in DoDI 5200.01 (Reference (cz)).
All classified information and CUI must be protected in accordance with References (bs), (by),
(bo), and (bp).
b. DoD’s information sharing policies and procedures are defined in DoDD 8320.02
(Reference (da)) and DoD 8320.02-G (Reference (db)). Information sharing actions and
activities will be aligned with the DoD Information Sharing Operational Strategy and Guidance
(see www.dodcio.defense.gov). A security clearance held is an attribute of any identified DoD
person, and that attribute should be discovered and considered when a decision is made to share
classified information. If the information intended to be shared is not classified, then other
attributes associated with the identity of the sharing recipient may need to be discovered before
the sharing is executed.
c. The Defense cybersecurity program provides the mechanisms to measure, monitor, and
enforce information security and sharing policies and procedures as they relate to information in
an electronic form, primarily through the implementation of security controls.
d. Information systems must protect classified information and CUI from unauthorized
access by requiring authentication in accordance with Reference (ct) prior to making an access
decision.

35

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
e. All unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release in
accordance with DoDD 5230.09 (Reference (dc)) and that is in the possession or control of nonDoD entities on non-DoD ISs must be protected in accordance with DoDI 8582.01 (Reference
(dd)).
f. Classified information and export controlled unclassified information released or disclosed
to industry in connection with contracts under the National Industrial Security Program must be
protected in accordance with Reference (bj).
g. Spillage of classified information onto an unclassified IS, of higher-level classified
information onto a lower level classified IS, or of classified information onto an IS not
authorized to the appropriate level must be handled in accordance with Reference (bo).
h. To enable automated sharing and protection, all DoD information must include marking
and metadata as required by References (bp), (bs) and (da), and that information must be in the
format specified in References (bp) and (by).
i. DoD IT that processes or stores PII or protected health information must comply with
Reference (bq), DoDI 5400.16 (Reference (de)), and DoD 8580.02-R (Reference (df)).
j. In accordance with Reference (de), a privacy impact assessment (PIA) is required for DoD
ISs that collect, maintain, use, or disseminate PII about members of the public, federal personnel,
contractors, or foreign nationals (FNs) employed at U.S. military facilities internationally.
k. All non-DoD entities that process unclassified DoD information on non-DoD ISs, to the
extent provided by the applicable contract, grant, or other legal agreement or understanding with
DoD, must comply with applicable Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplements and
will comply with Reference (dd), and, if a cleared contractor, with Reference (bj).
l. Unclassified DoD information in the possession of the DIB will be protected by
conducting DIB cybersecurity as established in Reference (ad), and cleared contractor facilities
will be protected in accordance with Reference (bj).
m. Cryptography required to protect DoD information will be implemented in accordance
with Reference (bi).
n. DoD information proposed or projected for publication on public Internet media (e.g.,
website, blog, social media) must be reviewed and approved for public dissemination in
accordance with Reference (dc), DoD Manual 5205.02 (Reference (dg)), and DoDI 8550.01
(Reference (dh)).

8. IDENTITY ASSURANCE
a. Identity assurance ensures strong identification and authentication, and eliminates
anonymity in DoD ISs so that entities’ access and access behavior are visible, traceable, and

36

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
enable continuous monitoring for LE and cybersecurity. Person and non-person entity identity
policies, standards, information, infrastructure, issuance, and revocation processes and
procedures that bind the physical and digital representations of entities will incorporate measures
to ensure the integrity, authenticity, security, privacy, and availability of authoritative identity
information across the full spectrum of DoD mission environments and operations.
(1) DoD ISs will use only DoD-approved identity credentials to authenticate entities
requesting access to or within the Defense information environment. This requirement extends
to all mission partners using DoD ISs.
(2) The identification of entities accessing DoD ISs must be recorded in order to deny
anonymity and deter abuse of authorized IS access. DoD will implement capabilities to record,
track, and monitor specific entity access to networks, applications, and web servers.
b. DoD IS will employ identity assurance procedures that are aligned with the DoD Identity
Management Strategic Plan and the Identity Assurance Implementation Guidance and Roadmap
to the extent practical.
c. Information and infrastructure that support identity reliant functions, processes, and
procedures used in support of DoD operations, including but not limited to identity credentialing,
will incorporate measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of
identity data or identity credentials.
d. Identity assurance policies and procedures regarding identity authentication for ISs are in
Reference (ct).

9. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
a. IT. Cybersecurity applies to all IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, or transmits
DoD information, as shown in Figure 2.

37

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
Figure 2. DoD Information Technology

(1) Information Systems. Cybersecurity requirements must be identified and included in
the design, development, acquisition, installation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all DoD
ISs in accordance with section 3544 of Reference (aa), References (q) and (r), section 2224 of
Reference (bh), this instruction, and other cybersecurity-related DoD guidance, as issued.
(a) DoD ISs are typically organized in one of two forms:
1. Enclave
a. Enclaves provide standard cybersecurity, such as boundary defense,
incident detection and response, and key management, and also deliver common applications,
such as office automation and electronic mail. Enclaves may be specific to an organization or a
mission, and the computing environments may be organized by physical proximity or by
function independent of location. Examples of enclaves include local area networks and the
applications they host, backbone networks, and data processing centers.
b. Enclaves always assume the highest security category of the ISs that they
host, and derive their security needs from those systems. See Reference (ch) for a discussion of
IS boundaries and the application of security controls.
2. Major Application (Formerly Automated Information System Application)
a. Certain applications, because of the information in them, require special
management oversight due to the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse,
or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application and should be
treated as major applications. A major application may be a single software application (e.g.,
integrated consumable items support); multiple software applications that are related to a single
mission (e.g., payroll or personnel); or a combination of software and hardware performing a
specific support function across a range of missions (e.g., Global Command and Control System,
Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System).

38

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

b. Major applications include any application that is a product or deliverable
of an Acquisition Category I through III program as defined in Enclosure 3 of Reference (av).
When operationally feasible all new major applications will be hosted in a Defense Enterprise
Computing Center.
c. All applications, regardless of whether they rise to the level of major
application or not, require an appropriate level of protection. Adequate security for other than
major applications may be provided by security of the environment in which they operate.
d. When possible, capabilities should be developed as applications hosted in
existing authorized computing environments (i.e., enclaves) rather than designated as major
applications requiring new and separate authorizations.
e. DoD Component CIOs will resolve disputes regarding whether an
application rises to the level of a major application.
(b) DoD IS Registration. All DoD ISs will be registered in the DITPR (at
https://ditpr.dod.mil/) or the SITR (at http://dodcio.osd.smil.mil/itregistry) in accordance with
current DITPR and SITR guidance, or with the DoD Component SAPCO for SAP ISs. New
DoD ISs should be entered into the DITPR or SITR at the beginning of the system development
life cycle.
(c) Stand-Alone Systems. DoD ISs and PIT systems that are stand-alone must be
authorized to operate, but assigned security control sets may be tailored as appropriate with the
approval of the AO (e.g., network-related controls may be eliminated).
(d) Notice and Consent Banners. Standard mandatory notice and consent banners
must be displayed at logon to all ISs and standard mandatory notice and consent provisions will
be included in all DoD IS user agreements in accordance with applicable security controls and
DoD implementation procedures in the KS. Official DoD standard notice and consent language
will be posted on the KS with copies posted to the IASE.
(2) PIT
(a) All PIT has cybersecurity considerations. The Defense cybersecurity program
only addresses the protection of the IT included in the platform. See Reference (q) for PIT
cybersecurity requirements.
(b) Examples of platforms that may include PIT are: weapons systems, training
simulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration equipment, equipment used in
the research and development of weapons systems, medical devices and health information
technologies, vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles (e.g., electric, bio-fuel, Liquid Natural Gas
that contain car-computers), buildings and their associated control systems (building automation
systems or building management systems, energy management system, fire and life safety,
physical security, elevators, etc.), utility distribution systems (such as electric, water, waste

39

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014
water, natural gas and steam), telecommunications systems designed specifically for industrial
control systems including supervisory control and data acquisition, direct digital control,
programmable logic controllers, other control devices and advanced metering or sub-metering,
including associated data transport mechanisms (e.g., data links, dedicated networks).
(c) Cybersecurity requirements must be identified, tailored appropriately, and
included in the acquisition, design, development, developmental and operational testing and
evaluation, integration, implementation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all DoD PIT in
accordance with References (bm) and (ay), this instruction, and other cybersecurity-related DoD
guidance, as issued.
(d) Owners of special purpose systems (i.e., platforms), in consultation with an AO,
may determine that a collection of PIT rises to the level of a PIT system.
1. PIT systems are analogous to enclaves but are dedicated only to the platforms
they support. PIT systems must be designated as such by the responsible OSD or DoD
Component heads or their delegates and authorized by an AO specifically appointed to authorize
PIT systems.
2. All DoD PIT systems will be categorized as defined in Reference (ci) and
authorized in accordance with Reference (q).
3. Although other federal departments and agencies may treat PIT systems as a
type of IS, DoD platforms supporting certain DoD missions have unique operational and security
needs. Due to the specialized purpose of their application, PIT systems require uniquely tailored
security control sets and control validation procedures and require security control assessors and
AOs with specialized qualifications.
4. Interconnections between PIT systems and other PIT systems or DoD ISs must
be protected either by implementation of security controls on the PIT system or the DoD IS.
5. For PIT systems that are stand-alone, assigned security control sets may be
tailored as appropriate with the approval of the AO (e.g., network-related controls may be
eliminated).
6. PIT systems must be registered at the DoD Component level.
(3) IT Service. An IT service is a form of a DoD internet service as described in
Reference (dh). It consists of IT capabilities that are provided according to a formal agreement
between DoD entities or between DoD and an entity external to DoD. Capabilities may include,
for example, information processing, storage, or transmission.
(a) An IT service is provided from outside the authorization boundary of the
organizational IS using the IT service and the using organization typically has no direct control
over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control
effectiveness.

40

ENCLOSURE 3

DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014

(b) IT services are net-centric and may be provided over service oriented or cloud
computing architectures and may be Internet-based.
(c) An internal IT service is implemented within DoD. The DoD entity providing the
service is responsible for the application of appropriate security controls and for ensuring that ISs
supporting service delivery are assessed and authorized in accordance with Reference (q).
Service-level agreements (SLAs) will be executed for internal services.
(d) An external IT service is implemented outside DoD. The DoD entity using the
external service will:
1. Ensure that interagency agreements or government statements of work for
external services incorporate requirements in accordance with this instruction. Requirements for
external services must include the application of appropriate security controls to the IT
supporting the external service delivery in accordance with Reference (q). Requests for
proposals will include sufficient information on which to evaluate each offeror’s proposed
approach to satisfying the security control requirements.
2. Ensure that processes, roles, and responsibilities are established between
program management office and network operations entities for continued assessment.
3. Ensure that all security relevant and operational status changes are reported
through the organization’s network operations chain of command to the Commander,
USSTRATCOM.
4. DoD enterprise-level agreements for services should be used when possible.
(4) IT Product
(a) Unified capability products will receive unified capability certification for
cybersecurity in accordance with Reference (ao).
(b) Products that protect classified information must comply with Reference (bg).
(c) Products must meet security configuration guidance in accordance with Chapter

TPM. The TPM is a microcontroller that stores keys, passwords, and digital certificates. It
typically is affixed to the motherboard of computers. It potentially can be used in any computing
device that requires these functions. The nature of this hardware chip ensures that the
information stored there is made more secure from external software attack and physical theft.
The TPM standard is a product of the Trusted Computing Group consortium. For more
information on the TPM specification and architecture, refer to
www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/groups/tpm.
UCDMO CDS Baseline List. A list managed by the UCDMO that identifies CDSs that are
available for deployment within the DoD and IC.
UCDMO CDS Sunset List. A list managed by the UCDMO that identifies CDSs that are or have
been in operation but are no longer available for additional deployment and need to be replaced
within a specified period of time.
