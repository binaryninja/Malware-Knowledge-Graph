Executive Summary

An unknown financially motivated threat group is using the self-proclaimed Hades
ransomware variant in cybercrime operations that have impacted at least three (3)
victims since December 2020.
Known victims include a large US transportation & logistics organization, a large US
consumer products organization, and a global manufacturing organization.
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) employed to compromise a victim network,
escalate privileges, move laterally, evade defenses, exfiltrate data and deploy Hades
ransomware are relatively consistent with other well-known ransomware operators,
using a combination of commodity tooling and various living-off-the-land techniques.

1/10

Of note, we observed significant effort by the threat group to disable or bypass
endpoint defenses, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tooling, using
both custom tooling and hands on keys approaches.
We assess with moderate confidence that the group's operations have just begun,
and that Hades activity will likely continue to proliferate into the foreseeable future,
impacting additional victims.
The information outlined in this blog is based on collection from CIFR incident response
engagements, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), and various media reports. This is a
developing story; additional details will be released to the community when available.
Summary & timeline

An unknown threat group is using the self-proclaimed Hades ransomware in cybercrime
operations that have impacted at least three (3) victims. Based on collection sources, the
threat group has been in operations since at least December 2020 and has continued to
target victims through March 2021. Accenture Security also analyzed the group's activities
in the context of attribution, victimology, and TTPs employed according to OSINT and
incident response data. Accenture Security assesses the group's operations have just
begun, and their activity will likely continue to proliferate into the foreseeable future,
targeting additional victims.
Victimology

We are currently aware of 3 victims, all of which are large multi-national organizations with
annual revenues exceeding $1 billion USD. The profiles of the three (3) known victims are a
strong indicator of Big Game Hunting, with target selection and deployment methods aimed
toward high-value payouts. This also may explain the relatively low number of known
victims since Hades was first identified publicly in December 2020.
Industries impacted so far based on known victimology include:
1. Transportation & Logistics
2. Consumer Products
3. Manufacturing & Distribution
Furthermore, we identified additional Tor hidden services and clearnet URLs via various
open-source reporting pertaining to the Hades ransomware samples. For all analyzed
samples, the ransom notes identified instruct the victim to install Tor browser and visit the
specified page. The Tor pages differ only in the Victim ID that is provided, indicating each
Tor address may be uniquely generated for each victim. Accenture Security identified a total
of six (6) of these addresses, indicating there could be three (3) additional victims we are
unaware of at this time.

Hades ransomware operations

At this time, it is unclear if the unknown threat group operates under an affiliate model, or if
Hades is distributed by a single group. Under an affiliate model, developers’ partner with
affiliates who are responsible for various tasks or stages of the operation lifecycle, such as
distributing the malware, providing initial access to organizations or even target selection
and reconnaissance. However, based on intrusion data from incident response
engagements, the operators tailor their tactics and tooling to carefully selected targets and
run a more “hands on keyboard” operation to inflict maximum damage and higher payouts.
In addition, we identified similarities in the Hades ransom notes to those that have been
used by REvil ransomware operators, where portions of the ransom notes observed contain
identical wording. The differentiating factors in the ransom notes are the operators’ contact
information and the formatting of the ransom notes. While the ransom notes are similar, we
do not have any evidence to suggest the threat groups or operations have any overlap at
this time.

The below provides a high-level summary based on analysis of Hades ransomware
samples:
Creates a copy of itself at the path %appdata%\[created folder]\[create file with no
extension] with a variable folder and file name.
Relaunches itself using the command line parameter go
Deletes itself and its copy using the following command structure where %s is the
path to file executable: “cmd /c waitfor /t %u pause /d y & attrib -h "%s" & del "%s" &
rd "%s"
Unpacks an executable in memory and executes it (i.e., the unpacked Hades sample)
Deletes shadow copies through “vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet”
Traverses local directories and network shares looking for files to encrypt and skips
files with specified extensions or strings
Adds an extension (different for each sample) to files that it encrypts and drops a
ransom note with file name “HOW-TO-DECRYPT-[extension].txt”
As previously noted, the ransom note includes a URL to a TOR site for ransom
instructions
In addition, based on significant code overlap found in Hades samples with other known
variants, Crowdstrike assesses that the new variant is a successor to WastedLocker
ransomware and possibly linked to Evil Corp operations.
Compromise activity & detection opportunities

Initial access
The primary method for initial access into the victim’s network appears to be internet-facing
systems via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) using
legitimate credentials.

4/10

Persistence
The use of legitimate credentials, service creation, and distribution of Command and
Control (C2) beacons across victim environments through the use of Cobalt Strike and
Empire, so far appear to be the predominant approach used by the unknown threat group to
further their foothold and maintain persistence. In addition, the threat actors operated out of
the root of C:\ProgramData where several executables tied to the intrusion set were found.
Privilege escalation
Credential harvesting and subsequent privilege escalation achieved through the use of
tooling and manual enumeration of credentials.
Defense evasion
Impeding defenses was achieved through use of domain administrator credentials and
includes the following:
Batch script that leverages wevtutil.exe to clear event logs on impacted hosts
Disabling Anti-Virus (AV) products on endpoints, as well as manually disabling
Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools and prevention policies through the user
interface
Modification of Group Policy Object (GPO) to disable windows audit logging
Discovery
Observed multiple methods for internal network reconnaissance, such as various
reconnaissance scripts and tools used to collect network, host, and domain information.
Lateral Movement
Lateral movement accomplished via compromised accounts obtained during internal
reconnaissance activities. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was also leveraged for host-tohost lateral movement.
Exfiltration & impact
Prior to deploying Hades ransomware, the unknown threat group has employed the 7zip
utility to archive data that was then staged and exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server
hosted in Mega[.]nz cloud infrastructure, leveraging the MEGAsync utility. In addition to data
theft, actors deploy Hades ransomware to encrypt files identified on the victim network.
Hades operators leverage this approach for "double-extortion" tactics.
Mitigation recommendations

Ensure robust crisis management, incident response and disaster recovery plans are
in place in the event of a data breach or ransomware incident.
Consider developing continuity of operations plans (COOP) that account for
ransomware or wiper attacks that can impact business operations.

5/10

Maintain best practices against ransomware, such as patching, firewalling infection
vectors, updating anti-virus software, employing a resilient backup strategy (e.g., 3-21, 3-2-2, etc.), implementing strict network egress policies, and using application
whitelisting where feasible.
Install and update anti-virus software to proactively identify and protect against
malware.
Consider deploying Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) across the environment,
targeting at least 90% endpoint and workload visibility.
In addition to a robust password policy, use MFA where possible for authenticating
corporate accounts to include remote access mechanisms (e.g., VPNs)
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections with complex passwords, virtual
private networks (VPNs) and Network Level Authentication (NLA), if RDP connections
must be used.
Patch infrastructure to the highest available level, as threat actors are often better
able to exploit older systems with existing vulnerabilities.
Encrypt data-at-rest where possible and protect decryption keys and technology.
Do not store credentials in files and scripts on shared locations
Where possible, deny caching of credentials in memory (e.g., Credential Guard)
Train users of all systems to positively identify and safely handle e-mails that could be
part of a phishing campaign.
