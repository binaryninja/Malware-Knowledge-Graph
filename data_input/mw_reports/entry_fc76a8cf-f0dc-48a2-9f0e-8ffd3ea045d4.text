Do the activities of cybercriminal gangs serve as a smokescreen to conceal Russian
espionage? For months, Truesec's Threat Intelligence team has been monitoring the
activities of Russian ransomware leagues and Russian intelligence services. There is much
to suggest that the Russian state is behind the cyberattacks.

Part 1 - The Ransomware Attack and Takeover
In October 2020, the Russian-based threat actor known as “Evil Corp” conducted a
ransomware attack against a major corporation. The attack vector to gain initial access was
a drive-by compromise: a legitimate website was compromised and visitors to the website
were prompted to download a fake Chrome update; a ZIP file, containing a JavaScript file.
The actual script was not recovered, but based on the information found, Truesec
established that it is highly likely that it was part of the SocGholish framework. The threat
actor behind SocGholish is known to leverage compromised websites to distribute malware
via fake browser updates. The following figure illustrates an example of this attack.

Double-clicking the JavaScript file triggered the Windows Scripting Host engine to run the
script, which in turn would start a backdoor giving the threat actor remote control of the
infected computer.
The initial backdoor was used five minutes later to deploy the second stage tool: Cobalt
Strike. The Cobalt Strike beacon was embedded into a C# project file and executed with the
Microsoft utility MsBuild.exe. An example of the execution is the following:

The csproj file defined a build task that was executed during the build process. This injected
the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory. The beacon used covert communication channels with
a technique called Domain Fronting. This leveraged the legitimate Content Delivery
Networks at msn.com, lastpass.com, and adobe.com, to proxy the traffic to the threat actor
infrastructure in the backend.

This level of sophistication makes network-based detection challenging, as the visible
communication is directed to legitimate CDN’s. The use of MsBuild.exe and the csproj file is
also a method to evade certain host-based detection techniques. The Cobalt Strike Beacon
also mimics a jquery request.

Cobalt Strike also downloaded an additional payload using the .NET webclient function
downloadstring.

Figure 4: Powershell command executed by threat actor.
The payload was downloaded from the URL http[:]//roofingspecialists[.]info/file. The payload
is a PowerShell script defining a function called getsystemtime, which is also invoked by the
dropper. The getsystemtime function contains a base64 encoded .NET assembly that is
loaded into memory.

The decoded assembly contained shellcode and .NET code to inject it into a process. An
excerpt from the decompiled assembly can be seen in the figure below.

The shellcode loaded by the above assembly does not execute anything directly but rather
loads selected libraries and defines additional attack code to the Cobalt Strike session on the
victim machine.
Seven minutes after the Cobalt Strike malware was deployed on the compromised client
computer (Patient Zero), the threat actor began network discovery activities and escalation
attempts and achieved full infrastructure compromise within four hours from the initial
breach. The threat actor leveraged common vulnerabilities such as passwords exposed on
network shares and exploiting unpatched systems.
It is noteworthy that manual operations probably began just minutes after the initial
compromise. This is remarkable, considering that the attack vector was a drive-by attack,
which essentially means that the threat actor must have been continuously monitoring their
C2 servers for new victims and immediately begun manual operations after they were alerted
to a new victim.

Reconnaissance and Ransomware Deployment
4/11

While the escalation in Active Directory only took a few hours, the internal reconnaissance
and data discovery began around a week after the initial compromise and went on for nearly
three weeks. During the first week the threat actor searched through many profiles and
pushed Cobalt Strike onto additional servers. They also used Internet Explorer on
compromised servers to access additional internal systems.
During the last two weeks, the threat actor focused the reconnaissance on methodically
gathering data from network shares, user profiles, browser history of IT admins, cloud-based
mailboxes, and eventually identified credentials and locations of the cloud-based backups in
use which were then deleted.
Moreover, the cloud solution in use for central management of endpoint protection software
was also accessed and used to uninstall security software from all systems. The level of
determination and methodology to identify information such as backup solutions and security
software platforms represents a high level of sophistication.
Almost a month after the initial compromise, the final stage of the attack began, when the
threat actor deployed the “Wasted Locker” ransomware on all systems, using remote WMI
commands and the Microsoft tool PsExec. During the encryption phase the threat actor
actively searched for encrypted files, likely to ensure encryption had succeeded.

Part 2 - Ties to an Espionage Campaign
A Friendly Warning

5/11

In April 2021, almost six months after the ransomware attack, the victim organization
contacted Truesec because of a mail received from a government cyber defense
organization. The mail was flagged TLP:Amber, so we cannot share it, but the essence of the
mail was that they were warned that their system may be under the control or impacted by a
cyber event. The mail included information about the initial compromise and then referred to
the report by PRODAFT about the SilverFish cyberespionage group for details.
Truesec could quickly confirm that the cyber event referred to in the warning was the initial
compromise that Truesec had found to be the start of the Wasted Locker ransomware attack.
We could also determine that the Cobalt Strike beacon used in the attack was in fact the
same Cobalt Strike beacon found in the PRODAFT report since it was using the same
domains and Domain Fronting technique described in the report. The domain used to
download the PowerShell script getsystemtime also appeared in the report from PRODAFT.
It appears that the threat actor behind the Wasted Locker ransomware attack was identical to
the SilverFish actor, but SilverFish was reported as a cyberespionage group that had used
the SolarWinds breach to gain access. The Truesec Threat Intelligence Unit then decided it
was time to dig a little deeper into the matter.

Timelines
To better understand the chain of events, we started to construct a timeline. Immediately we
noticed that there were several reports that the threat actor behind Wasted Locker were no
longer distributing this ransomware but had instead switched to another ransomware called
Hades. The first instance of the Hades ransomware attack was reported on 17 December
2020. This is important because in their report PRODAFT says they began after the
SolarWinds breach was exposed in December, when Wasted Locker was no longer active.
We could also indirectly confirm the link between the Wasted Locker and Hades ourselves,
as one of the threat actor IP addresses, 185[.]82.127.86, was used in the Wasted Locker
attack in October 2020 and was later reported to be a Hades C2 in January 2021.
Of all the IOCs that Truesec had found in the Wasted Locker ransomware attack in October
2020, the domains had appeared in a big cyberespionage campaign a month later, while at
least one of the IP addresses had been reused in a Hades ransomware attack.
The PRODAFT report lists many interesting facts about the threat actor named SilverFish,
which seems to be a very sophisticated and organized group. They had teams of hackers
working shifts, day and night. This certainly fits with our findings regarding the Wasted
Locker attack in October. Only a group working continuously in shifts would be capable of
reacting this fast to the successful drive-by attack.
Nevertheless, the PRODAFT report only mentions the SolarWinds breach as the attack
vector that SilverFish used. Nowhere do they mention drive-by attacks like the SocGholish
framework Truesec observed being the initial attack vector for the Wasted Locker attack.

It appears as if the same threat actor used their infrastructure for Wasted Locker attacks in
October 2020, only to shift their operation to run an espionage campaign stealing data from
victims of the SolarWinds breach in January 2021. So, what happened in between those two
dates?
Going back to the timeline for the SolarWinds breach, the most important date was the 13th
of December, the day the SolarWinds breach was publicized. This means that just four days
after the SolarWinds breach was made public, the threat actor behind the Wasted Locker
ransomware stopped using their ransomware and instead switched to the new Hades
ransomware.
One purpose of the SilverFish threat actor seems to have been to save as much as possible
of the access obtained by the SolarWinds breach once it was outed in the media. To do so
they used an existing infrastructure. An infrastructure that until then had been used to
conduct ransomware operations with the Wasted Locker ransomware.

Figure 9: Timelines for Wasted Locker and SolarWinds campaigns
In fact, the timelines of Wasted Locker and the SolarWinds breach had one more
congruency. The first known instance when the threat actor behind the SolarWinds breach
pushed the Sunburst malware was in February 2020. At the same time, the threat actor
behind Wasted Locker ceased operations in the end of February 2020, probably to prepare
to release the new Wasted Locker ransomware.

An Elusive Threat Actor
The threat actor behind the Wasted Locker ransomware attacks is generally believed to be
the infamous “Evil Corp” group. Evil Corp has for many years been a pioneer in financial
cybercrime. Their BitPaymer ransomware was one of the first truly successful ransomware
operations that pioneered the “Big Game Hunting” attacks against large corporate networks
earning millions of USD in ransom money.
Truesec has already exposed the special status that organized cybercrime seems to have in
Russia as long as they play by the unwritten rules. Rules that include staying on the good
side of the powerful Russian security service, FSB. In fact, the alleged leader of Evil Corp,

Forces unit and clandestine assassination attacks.

The US Government has blamed the Russian Intelligence Agency SVR for the SolarWinds
breach. The size and the scope of the SolarWinds breach makes it difficult to believe that
anything less than a state sponsored intelligence organization was behind the operation.
While there is no proof that SilverFish is part of the same organization as the threat actor
responsible for the SolarWinds breach, it seems they are a Russian cyberespionage group
that tries to exploit the success of the SolarWinds breach.
Who is this threat actor then? Is it a highly sophisticated cybercrime group that conducts
cyberespionage for profit, presumably selling the stolen data to the Russian government, or
is it even a cyberespionage group that runs a ransomware operation as a smoke screen to
cover their true purpose?

Part 3 - Conclusions
Follow the Money!
The threat actor Truesec observed in the Wasted Locker attack certainly appeared to be very
sophisticated. There is, however, one important area in which this threat actor does not seem
to be very sophisticated – scaring the victims into paying the ransom.
In 2020, virtually all major ransomware groups added data leak sites to their arsenal of
pressure to their victims. In addition to encrypting the victim’s data, they threaten to leak
sensitive corporate data publicly, hurting their business and possibly making them liable to
8/11

GDPR fines in addition to the cost of disrupted services. In 2021, some groups are
expanding their threats to include DDoS attacks and threatening phone calls.
By comparison, the threat actor behind Wasted Locker and Hades does not seem to have
spent much innovation on terrorizing their victims into paying the ransom, beyond the initial
ransomware. By the fall of 2020, Wasted Locker appears to be almost the only major
ransomware group that did not operate a data leak site.
The first report about Wasted Locker’s successor Hades, even mentions that victims of
Hades had trouble contacting the threat actor to pay the ransom. For such a sophisticated
cybercrime group, it seems almost amateurish to mess up the most important part of the
whole operation, the payment!

Maskirovka
If the threat actor behind the Wasted Locker ransomware is in fact identical to SilverFish, we
then have a highly sophisticated threat actor who displays a very high level of skill in almost
every aspect of their cyberattacks, including a highly organized cyberespionage campaign.
The only exception appears to be the step where they ensure they get paid from their
ransomware victims. It is as if the threat actor values stealth more than big money.
There is speculation that Evil Corp is keeping such a low profile because their leaders have
been sanctioned by OFAC in 2019. This is a possible explanation for the threat actor's
behaviour, but this does not explain the connections to SilverFish and the SolarWinds
breach.
There is also a possibility that Wasted Locker and SilverFish were run independently.
Theoretically, Russian Intelligence could have leaned on the threat actor running Wasted
Locker to let them take over part of their infrastructure to cover their tracks once the backlash
of the exposure of the SolarWinds breach became apparent. It would even explain the
apparent chaos when they suddenly shifted to the Hades ransomware.
There are, however, so many similarities in TTPs between the Wasted Locker attack that
Truesec investigated, and the threat actor described in the PRODAFT report. It is possible
that the entire Wasted Locker/Hades ransomware campaigns have been run as just a
“maskirovka”, the Russian word for deception, to hide a cyberespionage campaign. The
reason why they seem to be careless about extracting the ransom could simply be that it is
not important to them. They just need to keep up the appearance.
The threat actor that Truesec observed conducting the Wasted Locker ransomware attack
spent a long time systematically searching the compromised systems but stole very little
data. It is possible they initially searched for valuable data to steal, and only after they
determined the organization had no espionage value, decided to deploy the ransomware. If

so, perhaps some of the victims in the SilverFish campaign were in fact infected by
SocGholish, but never received the Wasted Locker ransomware, because they were deemed
too important as espionage victims.

End Note – The New Russia
While researching this report, we came across an article about Maksim Yakubets, the alleged
leader of Evil Corp, that included the sentence “In April 2018, Yakubets was in the process of
obtaining a license to work with classified Russian information from the Russian spy agency,
the FSB - the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.”
Russia is notorious for blurring lines and purposefully operating on the borders between war
and peace to achieve their ends through “hybrid-warfare.” Russian oligarchs blur the lines
between public and private, as they own private mercenary groups that support Russian
foreign objectives, while providing deniability to the Russian government.
Perhaps the threat actor behind both Wasted Locker and SilverFish is the latest iteration of
Evil Corp after all? Perhaps Evil Corp has now morphed into a mercenary espionage
organization controlled by Russian Intelligence but hiding behind the façade of a cybercrime
ring, blurring the lines between crime and espionage. If so, it would likely mean that this
group uses the ransom money paid by victims to finance their espionage operations.
