Summary
Alien Labs has identified an unreported and ongoing malware campaign, which we
attribute with high confidence to the adversary publicly reported as “StrongPity”. Based
on compilation times, infrastructure, and public distribution of samples - we assess the
campaign operated from the second half of 2018 into today (July 2019).
This post details new malware and new infrastructure which is used to control
compromised machines. We have also identified StrongPity deploying malicious versions
of the WinBox router management software, WinRAR, and other trusted software to
compromise targets.

Background
StrongPity was first publicly reported on in October 2016 with details on attacks against
users in Belgium and Italy in mid-2016. In this campaign, StrongPity used watering holes
to deliver malicious versions of WinRAR and TrueCrypt file encryption software.
Microsoft released an intelligence report in December 2016 which details the
PROMETHIUM adversary group and its links to the Kaspersky StrongPity blog. In the
report, Microsoft details how PROMETHIUM (StrongPity) has been active since at least
2012 and made use of CVE-2016-4117 during 2016 operations.
In December 2017, ESET publicly reported on a campaign in which users attempting to
download a variety of legitimate software were rerouted to downloading StrongPity
malware, which seeks out documents and folders from the victims.
On March 2018, The Citizen Lab publicly reported on activity against users in Turkey and
Syria which redirected a large number of users to download malicious StrongPity versions
of legitimate software. Cylance followed up in October 2018 with a blog post containing
new intelligence on the adversary as they were shifting, likley in response to previous
reporting, and attempting to evade detection and continue operations.

Technical details
In early July 2019 Alien Labs began identifying new samples resembling StrongPity. The
new malware samples have been unreported and generally appear to have been created
and deployed to targets following a toolset rebuild in response to the above public
reporting during the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on compilation times, infrastructure
build and use, and public distribution of samples, we assess the below activity continues
to operate successfully as of this report.

One sample identified is a malicious installer for WinBox. WinBox is a utility that allows
administration of Mikrotik RouterOS using a simple GUI. The malicious version of the
software installs StrongPity malware without any obvious signs to the victim, and then
operates as if it were a standard unaltered version of the trusted software:

Figure 1: GUI of malicious WinBox software shown after install.
The malware generally operates in a similar fashion to previous reports of
StrongPity. With complete spyware capability, the malware seeks out stored documents
and retains the ability for further remote access. The malicious WinBox installer drops
the StrongPity sample into the Windows Temporary directory as %temp%\DDF5CC44CDB42E5\wintcsr.exe. Similar to previous reports of StrongPity, the malware
communicates with the C2 server over SSL.

In this sample, the victim will beacon to https://srv-cdn3system[.]com/p5pss34gvx21pxo0bz25vlqu.php. It is noteworthy to mention the
/p5pss34gvx21pxo0bz25vlqu.php beacon destination continues to be the adversary
choice even though it was previously publicly reported. We have also identified the URI of
/goN9Z2In7mYQmN92dzX11CQL.php in addition to previously reported campaigns
using kU2QLsNB6TzexJv5vGdunVXT.php and p55C3xhxTuD5rkBQbB8wE99Q.php.
Reviewing the compilation timestamps of the identified malware, various clusters of
individual campaign start times can be noticed, stretching back into the previous reports
of early 2018

Figure 3: Timeline of PE complication times and C2 domain registration.
We have observed a variety of other software used as installers for StrongPity as well. For
example, newer versions WinRAR and a tool called Internet Download Manager (IDM)
which maliciously installs StrongPity and communicates with related adversary
infrastructure:

Figure 5: A sample of malicious IDM Installer GUI.
As of this report we are unable to confirm the specifics around delivery of the malicious
installers. However it is likely that methods previously documented by the previous
reports of StrongPity, such as regional download redirecting from ISPs, is still occuring.
Based on the type of software used as the installer (WinRAR, WinBox, IDM, etc.), the type
of targets may continue to be technically-oriented, again similar to past reports.
A potential insight into the adversary can be gained from reviewing the compilation hours
of the large collection of malware samples. Based on this report’s findings, all samples fit
into a standard eight hour workday between 7AM UTC and 3PM UTC.
Overall, the identified TTPs, newer versions of StrongPity, and the legitimate software
used to deliver it operate in ways similar to how the adversary has historically operated.
This is likely due to the high amounts of operational success for the adversary with
minimal modification to evade detection following public reporting over the years.
