CYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY

drastic when compared to the damages
incurred on any one of the major disasters that
occurred over the last 30 years. If something
goes wrong in this industry, lives, local habitats
and even global economies are at risk.

Cybersecurity in the
Oil and Gas Industry
When discussing an unsuccessful
attempt at drilling for oil in the
Mukluk Prospect of the Beaufort Sea
in 1983, the then President of
Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio), Richard
Bray, once remarked "We drilled in
the right place - we were simply 30
million years too late."

It’s no wonder that this industry has pioneered
the implementation of Health, Safety and
Environment (HSE) as an organizational pillar
universal in this sector. The safety and
wellbeing of others takes prominent stage
whether upstream, midstream or downstream,
even before that of the hydrocarbons that each
company struggles so hard to find, refine,
transport and sell.

T

he story of millions of dollars lost in
drilling into a dry bed in Mukluk
underscores the risks associated with
exploration and subsurface operations within
the Oil and Gas industry. It was a pivotal
learning experience that led to a better
understanding in the industry on the value of
proper risk management and risk
implementation within decision-making.
The oil and gas Industry has always carried a
unique set of risks. Unlike most other sectors
where protecting intellectual property (IP) takes
a prominent role within the corporate Risk
Management Framework, the dangers
associated with oil and gas places the security
of people and the environment at the forefront
of their risk policies.
The oil and gas industry always carries the
dangers associated with dealing with a
combustible element in extreme and often
remote conditions. Add to those dangers the
often unpredictable nature of sociopolitical
events with the often inclement weather of
drilling locations, and the very nature of finding,
transporting, and refining oil and natural gas
becomes daunting.
Losing money by drilling into a dry well, while
damaging to the revenue stream, appears less

Few industries triage and escalate prospective
(HSE) near misses with the purpose of
predicting incidents with the same
thoroughness as oil and gas companies. Fewer
private sector companies promote the value of
such seemingly innocuous acts as holding the
handrails when climbing or descending stairs, or
making sure to start each presentation with a
safety slide describing the precautions or
actions attendees must know about in the
event of an emergency.
Intellectual Property Paradox
In the oil and gas industry Intellectual Property
(IP) takes-up various forms. From volume,
velocity and variety readings to geophysical
equations, the data that flows throughout every
part of an upstream, midstream, and
downstream company is as varied as it is sacred
to the present and future health of each
organization.
Compounding the challenge in protecting IP in
oil and gas is the accessibility of data crucial to
the complete operation of the industry. In
enhance exploration and production, for
example, IP is being used not only to find new
sources of oil and gas, but to reduce the nonproductive time (NPT) of assets by predictive
maintenance of critical components such as
ESPs (electric submersible pumps).

IP is even being used to help reduce the Health,
Safety and Environment incidents within drilling
and production, and provide end-to-end views
of hydrocarbon reservoirs and advanced
pattern detection.
In refining and manufacturing, IP is used to
reduce the NPT of assets through the predictive
maintenance of critical components such as
rotary equipment. IP can also include the data
used to improve asset performance
management through real-time metrics across
different subsystems.
IP provides the competitive advantage that sets
each company apart from the other in a highlyintegrated industry. It also helps oil and gas
companies better understand the current
environment to deliver better future results.
The challenge with IP in the oil and gas sector is
determining how to best keep the IP safe, yet
accessible to those that need it.
In attempting to understand the complete
dynamics that go into making safety and
security a top priority in the Oil and Gas Sector,
it’s easy to overlook the importance of
cybersecurity and the integration of information
technology (IT) and operational technology
(OT).
Operational Technology is hardware and
software that a company uses to monitor or
control an environment. OT commonly detects,
measures, and executes a change, or event,
within a given physical area. Most commonly
associated with physical access devices or
within manufacturing, OT has increasing
become integrated within the IT backbone of
many organizations. Understanding this
technological merger is important step in
understanding the threat landscape.
The Universal Trend
Depending upon your sources, the statistics on
cyber-attacks varies. According to a recent
Symantec study there was a 91 percent increase
in targeted attack campaigns in 2013, which

includes a 62 percent increase in the number of
breaches. The same report cited that 1 in 392
emails contain phishing attacks and that webbased attacks are up 23 percent over a similar
time last year.
http://www.symantec.com/security_response/
publications/threatreport.jsp
A different report by IBM stated that in the
United States alone, there was an estimated 1.5
million monitored cyber-attacks in 2013. That
equates to roughly a 12 percent year to year
increase in security events. (http://www935.ibm.com/services/us/en/itservices/security-services/data-breach/)
Regardless of the numbers, two common trends
in cybersecurity are clear:
•
•

The rise in cyber-attacks
The increase in attack sophistication

Over the last 30 years the oil and gas sector has
endured a number of well-known cyber-attacks.
One of the most famous attacks, perpetrated by
an organization called the Cutting Sword of
Justice, was the Saudi Aramco attack of 2012.
This attack aimed at stopping oil and gas
production in Saudi Arabia’s largest exporter
within the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
This attack crippled 30,000 computers and
disrupted Saudi Aramco for months. However,
an important lesson from the attack pertains to
the Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
aftermath. If all your desktop computers
suddenly became useless, could your
organization operate completely on paper if it
had to? Could your organization procure
thousands of new hard drives if it needed to
replace all of its computer systems? How long
would that take? Where would those
computers come from? What procedure would
employees follow and how would they know
what to do?

A

s devastating as the attack was on Saudi
Aramco, in some respects it was
fortunate. The cyber-attack focused on
damaging 32-bit machines, leaving the 64-bit
servers intact. The attack on RasGas Company
Limited, possibly by the same organization just
two weeks later, included an improved variant
of the Aramco virus that infected 32 and 64-bit
machines, making that devastation more
severe. The main takeaway from this second
attack is a lesson on how fast back-to-back
attacks can occur, and how well attackers learn
from their mistakes.
The attack on Saudi Aramco ultimately failed to
disrupt production, but was one of the most
destructive cybersecurity strikes against a single
business.

More importantly, this attack
echoed the need for oil and gas
companies to evaluate the
importance of a cyber-threat
landscape with regard to attacks
and uncovered vulnerabilities.
Understanding the Threat Landscape
The global oil industry is expected to spend
$1.87 billion by 2018 in cyber-security. This
figure is according to a 2013 study by ABI
Research, which states that the oil and gas
sector “is connecting its industrial control
systems (OT) full of unpatched vulnerabilities to
the Internet, where cybercriminals roam in all
impunity.”
The ABI Research study also describes the IT
infrastructure in many oil and gas companies as
“poorly protected against cyber threats…at
best, they are secured with IT solutions which
are ill-adapted to legacy control systems such as
SCADA.” As a measure to update their security
infrastructure, this study predicts that the oil
and gas sector will increase spending in IT and
OT security significantly.

According to a similar report by Frost & Sullivan,
entitled Global Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Security Market Assessment, the total oil and
gas infrastructure security market is expected
to increase from $18 billion dollars a year in
2011 to $31 billion dollars by 2021.

bal-oil-gas-infrastructure-security-mkt-m83dnov-2012
Finally, during a recent Cybersecurity for Oil,
Gas, and Petrochemicals Summit, the organizers
of the summit quoted the Global State of
Information Security® Survey 2014, by Price
Waterhouse Coopers, that demonstrated
spending on cybersecurity solutions in the oil
and gas sector increasing by average of 32% in
2013 from the previous year.

These reports allude to an increase in cyberattacks by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs),
a term coined by the United States Government
describing organized conglomerates of hackers
and cyber-attackers that target specific
companies or governments as part of an
agenda. APTs are regarded as well-funded, wellsupported and well-educated.
The reports also suggest three reasons that the
oil and gas industry needs to move towards a
more stringent application of cybersecurity:

1. Greater Integration within Value Chain
The very nature of the oil sector as a giant
ecosystem comprised of upstream, midstream
and downstream companies and organizations
complicates the security landscape. This
massive infrastructure made-up of Independent
Oil Companies (IOCs), state-owned oil
companies, smaller companies that focus on
only certain streams and armies of service
providers and third-party entities provides a
ripe environment for security gaps and multiple
points of entry.

The additional integration between these
organizations within the oil and gas ecosystem
can lead to ripple effects when a disruption
such as a spill, an attack, or a sociopolitical issue
occurs.

required physical access and was seldom
networked for remote access. However, the
integration between IT and OT is changing this
very nature of OT to produce a potential
opening for cyber-attacks.

2. Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality
(AIC)

The oil and gas sector was built with
accessibility at its core. The entire nature of the
industry, since its inception, is to focus on
making oil and gas as accessible as possible
whether removing it from the ground,
transporting it to refineries or getting it to the
consumer.
The need for accessibility at this level has
created an industry that relies heavily on
operating technology and an AIC model where
the technology in place focuses more on
availability and less on confidentiality:
• Availability: Ensures that all resources
(systems and data) are available when
needed
• Integrity: Prevents the unauthorized
modification of data including
unintentionally inaccurate data. This could
be a software programming, or system
configuration error, absence of data, or
added data.
• Confidentiality: Ensures that only authorized
people can access resources

ndustries less reliant on OT use a more
common CIA model of prioritization with
confidentiality of IP and data as its top
priority. However, the oil and gas industry was
designed with availability of oil and gas, and the
data that provides their availability, as its main
focus. This is indicative on an industry heavily
dependent on volume, numbers, and pressure
readings. In the past the AIC model hadn’t
caused a significant security concern because
the OT that provided much of this accessibility

In the oil and gas sector this integration is
focused on making the OT remotely accessible
to provide a faster understanding of the data
and improve production performance, while
providing remote support and diagnostics.
Network-added capabilities to OT increase the
availability of data and the subsequent
accessibility of oil and gas that this industry
needs to become more agile and minimize
costs. The vulnerabilities associated with this
integration, however, are two-fold.
First, by placing OT on the network it
automatically makes it available to those that
hack or breach the network those nodes are on.
This places the confidentiality and integrity
aspect of the AIC model at risk.
And secondly, by adding networking and
remote controlling capabilities to operational
technology often uses commercial off-the-shelf
technologies (COTs). Desktops or laptops with

standard 32-bit operating systems, USB port
integration, embedded 802.11a,b,c and n
antennas, Bluetooth, Ethernet—all of these
technologies need patching, updating, antivirus
and maintenance. OT, often built to provide
unidirectional communication and legacy
operating systems, can’t rely upon an IT-centric
approach to basic security such as anti-virus and
patching.
The result of this integration can be an out-ofdate operating system that an organization
hasn’t updated with a patch because the patch
requires a change. The system is tested (Factory
Acceptance Test or FAT) in a certain
configuration, which is signed off by the system
vendor and the customer as functioning
correctly. Any change from that configuration,
including a patch, renders the FAT invalid and
therefore the system invalid. Companies (and
the vendors) have not seen the need to patch
and in some cases, the vendor will not provide
approved patches and void the warranty if any
unapproved patches are applied.

3. Newer technologies
Adding to the complexities associated with a
highly-integrated industry dealing with the
combination of IT and OT are the new
technologies on the horizon that could further
blur the lines for a CIO or CISO attempting to
protect the enterprise.
Digital oil fields connected to cloud systems
that run Big Data initiatives, the use of drones in
upstream oil and gas to run magnetic surveys,
gravity anomaly surveys or monitoring for
environmental issues and third-party
companies that are now providing the ability to
host 3D modeling for Well and Field Planning
can complicate security policies. These are just
a few of the cutting-edge technologies currently
permeating the industry that could create
additional vulnerabilities, particularly when
paired with the integration of IT and OT.

The result of these vulnerabilities are the need
to allocate spending on IT networks, industrial
control systems and data security as well as
emergency counter measures and the
development of policies and procedures that
provide the balance required between
accessibility, confidentiality and integrity.

Cybersecurity and Health, Safety and
Environment
The best approach towards mitigating the
cyber-threat associated with IT and OT is to
examine their integration in a collaborative
environment. The discussion shouldn’t be IT
versus OT but rather IT and OT. The integration
of the two technologies is inevitable, but the
policies and procedures need to be bolstered to
incorporate the capabilities, or requirements of
and difference between, each technology. In
many ways the safety of an organization and its
IT is dependent on this successful integration.
According to the United States Occupational
Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), before
its creation 43 years ago, an estimated 14,000
workers were killed on the job every year.
Today, workplaces are much safer, going from
38 fatal injuries a day to 12.

tml
Much of the success that the oil and gas sector
has had in mitigating the risks and dangers
around their day-to-day activities associated
with working with a combustible element in a
dangerous environment has been by
implementing stringent procedures within HSE
that include tracking incidents and near misses,
not just injuries and fatalities.

CYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY

Currently, the oil and gas industry tracks:
• the number of near safety misses
• the number of minor safety incidents
• the number of safety incidents that lead
to a loss of time
• the number of fatalities
The current state of HSE is a study in evolution,
generally created in 3-phases. The first phase of
safety within oil and gas was aimed at trying to
determine the safety-risk of an organization.
When the reduction in accidents flattened out,
the oil and gas industry entered phase two,
which added procedures. In the wake of the
Piper Alpha disaster of 1988, in which 167 oil rig
workers lost their lives, these procedures
focused primarily around work management.
Finally, when that reduction flattened out, the
oil and gas industry evolved to the current state
of behavioral safety, which entails trying to get
people to stop doing unsafe things and not cut
corners or ignore procedures.
The true lesson in these phases of HSE
evolution, which run in-parallel with the
evolution of cybersecurity, is the need to
address challenges through solutions that
encompass people, processes and technology,
in parallel. By adding this level of rigor, oil and
gas companies are able to predict and mitigate
the level of risk that their employees and local
communities are subject to in the present and
near future. This rigor is accompanied by
comprehensive safety training that encourages
the vigilant participation of all staff in lookingfor and calling-out potential safety issues and
incidents.
This process can be as effective with
cybersecurity, and the vulnerabilities of
integrating IT and OT, as it is with health, safety
and the environment. If a tech, for example, is
about to plug a USB device into a computer or
OT device, and by following procedure, first
scans the USB which then detects a virus, this
should be recorded in a central log as a “near
miss.”

If a breach is detected by a cybersecurity
analyst, and results in no data loss, this activity
should be recorded as an “incident.” If a loss of
data or integrity is reported, this should be
recorded as a “loss.”

By standardizing, recording and
tracking all cybersecurity activities in
a manner similar to the way HSE
records incidents, organizations can
better mitigate the integration of IT
and OT, and the risks associated with
their technological ecosystems.
Aligning Solutions
The greatest challenge in mitigating the risks
associated with IT and OT integration, and in
standardizing, recording and tracking
cybersecurity activities lies in finding a platform
that centralizes all the moving parts of this
strategy. All too often, cybersecurity platforms
are too IT focused and don’t incorporate the OT
elements of data integrity and availability.
Lockheed Martin has approached this challenge
by successfully combining the IT and OT
landscapes with the integration of Industrial
Defender. Industrial Defender is a security
product company built on a robust history of OT
security knowledge and experience. Industrial
Defender helps organizations address the
people (e.g. training), the processes (e.g. policy
and procedures) and implement the security
technologies needed to address modern OT
security challenges.

management. All these capabilities are
experienced through a single portal across a
company’s asset base. This solution includes
deploying automation system agents that are
purpose-built to integrate with technologies
from leading automation vendors, and deliver
critical capabilities that support the overall
enterprise.
More importantly, this solution does not
negatively impact operations or systems. It
provides solutions supported by the operational
and compliance requirements at the heart of
each project.
When paired with Lockheed Martin’s
Intelligence Driven Defense (IDD), it creates a
holistic approach that protects IT and IP from
the Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This
threat is comprised of well-funded, well-trained
organizations trying to specifically target a
company in an effort to steal data and impact
their operational environment.
An approach to cybersecurity similar to HSE,
combined with Intelligent Driven Defense and
Industrial Defender solutions addresses the fullspectrum of threats in a manner that maintains
the accessibility needed within oil and gas,
while safeguarding the confidentiality and
integrity integral to IT and OT.
