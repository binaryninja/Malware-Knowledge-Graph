The new zero-day in the Windows OS exploited in targeted attacks
In February 2019, our Automatic Exploit Prevention (AEP) systems detected an attempt to
exploit a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Further analysis of this
event led to us discovering a zero-day vulnerability in win32k.sys. We reported it to Microsoft
on February 22, 2019. The company confirmed the vulnerability and assigned it CVE-20190797. Microsoft have just released a patch, crediting Kaspersky Lab researchers Vasiliy
Berdnikov and Boris Larin with the discovery:

This is the fourth consecutive exploited Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Windows
we have discovered recently using our technologies. Just like with CVE-2018-8589, we
believe this exploit is used by several threat actors including, but possibly not limited to,
FruityArmor and SandCat. While FruityArmor is known to have used zero-days before,
SandCat is a new APT we discovered only recently. In addition to CVE-2019-0797 and
CHAINSHOT, SandCat also uses the FinFisher/FinSpy framework.
Kaspersky Lab products detected this exploit proactively through the following technologies:
1. Behavioral detection engine and Automatic Exploit Prevention for endpoint products;
2. Advanced Sandboxing and Anti Malware engine for Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack
Platform (KATA).
Kaspersky Lab verdicts for the artifacts used in this and related attacks are:
HEUR:Exploit.Win32.Generic
HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic
PDM:Exploit.Win32.Generic

Brief technical details – CVE-2019-0797
CVE-2019-0797 is a race condition that is present in the win32k driver due to a lack of
proper synchronization between undocumented syscalls NtDCompositionDiscardFrame and
NtDCompositionDestroyConnection. The vulnerable code can be observed below on
screenshots made on an up-to-date system during initial analysis:

Snippet of NtDCompositionDiscardFrame syscall (Windows 8.1)

On this screenshot with the simplified logic of the NtDCompositionDiscardFrame syscall you
can see that this code acquires a lock that is related to frame operations in the structure
DirectComposition::CConnection and tries to find a frame that corresponds to a given id and
will eventually call a free on it. The problem with this can be observed on the second
screenshot:

Snippet of NtDCompositionDestroyConnection syscall inner function (Windows 8.1)

On this screenshot with the simplified logic of the function DiscardAllCompositionFrames that
is called from within the NtDCompositionDestroyConnection syscall you can see that it does
not acquire the necessary lock and calls the function DiscardAllCompositionFrames that will
release all allocated frames. The problem lies in the fact that when the syscalls
NtDCompositionDiscardFrame and NtDCompositionDestroyConnection are executed
simultaneously, the function DiscardAllCompositionFrames may be executed at a time when
the NtDCompositionDiscardFrame syscall is already looking for a frame to release or has
already found it. This condition leads to a use-after-free scenario.
Interestingly, this is the third race condition zero-day exploit used by the same group in
addition to CVE-2018-8589 and CVE-2018-8611.

Stop execution if module file name contains substring “chrome.exe”

The exploit that was found in the wild was targeting 64-bit operating systems in the range
from Windows 8 to Windows 10 build 15063. The exploitation process for all those operating
systems does not differ greatly and is performed using heap spraying palettes and
accelerator tables with the use of GdiSharedHandleTable and gSharedInfo to leak their
kernel addresses. In exploitation of Windows 10 build 14393 and higher windows are used
instead of palettes. Besides that, that exploit performs a check on whether it’s running from
Google Chrome and stops execution if it is because vulnerability CVE-2019-0797 can’t be
exploited within a sandbox.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on

It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
