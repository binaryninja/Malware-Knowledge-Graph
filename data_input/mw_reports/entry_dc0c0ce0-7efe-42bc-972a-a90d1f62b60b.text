Interview with a LockBit ransomware operator

INTRODUCTION
In September 2020, Cisco Talos established contact with a self-described
LockBit operator and experienced threat actor. Over the course of several
weeks, we conducted multiple interviews that gave us a rare, first-hand
account of a ransomware operator’s cybercriminal activities. Through
these exchanges, we gleaned several valuable takeaways for executives
and the broader cybersecurity community.
Companies and security strategists are often most
concerned about prolific threats that garner lots of media
attention — those involving APTs, sophisticated TTPs and
large-scale compromises costing organizations millions of
dollars. What is frequently overlooked, though, is a more
common and simpler type of threat, which was represented
by the LockBit operator we spoke with. The actor is
allegedly self-taught and stays up to date on the latest
cybersecurity developments, weaponizing new research
to use in future attacks. He operates alone, without the
support of a large group or state actor. He uses well-known
tactics, relying heavily on common tools like Mimikatz,
PowerShell, and others rather than exploiting zero-day
vulnerabilities or using more sophisticated methods. He
looks for targets with well-known security issues that can
be easily exploited, and, like many criminals, he says he
seeks only modest financial gains to provide for his family.
This actor’s TTPs remind us to remain vigilant about
these seemingly unsophisticated, common cybercriminals
who, despite their straightforward approach to targeting
and operations, continue to be highly successful in
compromising companies and wreaking havoc on
unsuspecting victims. Below are our key takeaways for
executives and network defenders from our interview with
this LockBit operator:

•

•

Threat actors continue to view unpatched systems
as an easy, if not preferred, method of intrusion.
Routine patching can be difficult, especially for large
organizations, and the bad guys know this, too. The
most commonly exploited vulnerabilities are those that
are well-understood with publicly available exploit code.
Many cybercriminals rely almost exclusively on
common open-source tools that are readily available

on the internet and easy to use. They are not looking
to reinvent the wheel, and tool reuse is a quicker, more
effective way for them to carry out their operations
than leveraging more sophisticated means. Companies
should be most concerned about the tools and tactics
that are also likely used by their own red teams.

•

Cybercriminals are avid consumers of security
news and remain up to date on the latest research
and vulnerabilities, weaponizing that information
to use in future attacks. They are often self-taught
and hungry for continual knowledge, a mentality that
all but ensures they will always be updating their TTPs
and looking for new ways to make their attacks more
successful. Organizations should encourage their
security teams to continue their own learning — not just
by obtaining industry-respected security certificates,
but by remaining familiar with the latest open-source
information, conducting their own research, and closely
following trends in the threat landscape.

•

While threat actors may state publicly that their
personal ethics influence their target selection,
many adversaries go after the easiest victims
regardless of any moral obligation, based on our
experience. We assess that schools, health care
providers, and COVID-19 response-affiliated entities
remain high-value targets — despite contrary claims
by threat actors — given their generally under-funded
cybersecurity teams and low downtime tolerance.

This report also has a human-interest component, as it
explores the actor’s professed motivations for transitioning
from legitimate IT work to illicit cyber activity, his insights
on the current threat landscape, and his thoughts on other
major ransomware groups. Below are some of the most

Interview with a LockBit ransomware operator

interesting claims this LockBit operator made, which, if true,
provide valuable insight into the current ransomware scene.

•

The actor appears to have a contradictory code of
ethics, portraying a strong disdain for those who
attack health care entities while displaying conflicting
evidence about whether he targets them himself. This is
probably representative of many adversaries engaged
in illicit cyber activity.

•

Hospitals are considered easy targets, making ransom
payments 80 to 90 percent of the time during a
ransomware attack.

•

Maze formerly kept up to 35 percent of ransom profits
earned by its affiliates, an extremely high amount
compared to other ransomware groups that likely
deterred some actors from working with them.

•

•

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
law plays to adversaries’ favor, with victims in Europe
being more likely to pay ransoms to avoid the legal
consequences of the compromise if it became public
knowledge.
The U.S. also has lucrative targets, but with data
privacy laws requiring victim companies to report all
breaches — regardless of whether an attack is mitigated
via cooperation with the adversary — the incentive for
such entities to pay the ransom is likely somewhat
reduced.

INITIAL CONTACT
AND ACTOR CREDIBILITY
This operator has several usernames and handles on
various social media platforms. As explained below,
he made initial contact with us on Twitter using his @
uhodiransomwar account (transliterated from Russian as
“go away, ransomware”). The first mention of this actor
in open-source reporting was in June 2020, when he
published access to a major VPN provider’s SSH keys.
That same month, security researchers at KELA mentioned
uhodiransomwar as being active since 2009 and associated
with LockBit ransomware.
Our contact with the actor, who we will refer to throughout
this report as the fictitious name “Aleks,” began in early
September, when he used his uhodiransomwar account to
Tweet that he had compromised a Latin American financial
institution. Shortly thereafter, the actor tweeted at the

victim organization, this time tagging several cybersecurity
contacts, likely to compel the victim to respond by drawing
public attention to the attack. One of the tagged accounts
belonged to Bleeping Computer, a technology news website
that has previously communicated with other ransomware
operators, and one of the authors of this paper, who focuses
on cybercrime in Eastern Europe and Asia. We believe Azim
was tagged because he initially followed @uhodiransomwar’s
account for research purposes.
We used this initial indirect contact as an inroad to
establish communication with uhodiransomwar. We
directly messaged Aleks with questions that were specific
to the conditions he set for the victim. During our initial
conversations, we shared what we believed to be Aleks’
identity and location based on our own research, which he
confirmed. The threat actor was familiar with Talos' work
based on the information available on their Twitter account.
Notably, this did not discourage Aleks from engaging with
us. Rather, it sparked a lot of curiosity about the “white hat”
side of the business, as he referred to it. Our initial chats,
which focused mostly on the victim, occurred over Twitter’s
direct messaging platform. It was during this time that Aleks
offered to conduct an interview for what he referred to as
“my interests and research purposes.” Talos accepted the
offer, interviewing the subject over the course of several
days during late September and early October 2020.
Before the interview began, Aleks established some
preconditions and guidelines. First, he requested that
we refer to him specifically as a “LockBit operator.”

Additionally, while he agreed to let us publish our summary and analysis of the
interview, he asked us not to share the evidence he provided as proof of his
access to LockBit operations. One of the pieces of evidence was a screenshot
of a conversation between himself and the victim. Aleks also shared information
about a victim organization being compromised two days before the breach was
made public, highlighting his inside knowledge of LockBit threat activity. Lastly,
Aleks provided some evidence of victims that had paid their ransom on time,
but he did not want their names disclosed since they had “honored” their part
of the transaction. As always, Talos provided any relevant information to our law
enforcement partners at the conclusion of our research.
We found Aleks to be credible during our conversations. As outlined above and
throughout other parts of this report, he provided ample evidence of his standing
within the LockBit community, including advance knowledge of LockBit operations
and changes to the group’s ransomware, which we were able to corroborate. His
seemingly strong moral convictions — including protecting victims’ identities if
they paid the ransom, his emphasis on the importance of establishing trust with a
victim, and the existence of certain ethical guidelines pertaining to targeting — also
positively influenced our assessment of his credibility. Aleks also seemed to be
forthcoming in sharing personal information about himself, including his immediate
family, highlighting his openness and a degree of vulnerability. Lastly, we generally
found him responsive to our requests to maintain an ongoing dialogue and he was
willing to answer our questions with what seemed like full transparency.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
AND ACTOR MOTIVATION
By learning about Aleks’ professional background and personal interests and
beliefs, we came to understand what drove him to engage in cyber criminal
activities, how he selects his targets, his thoughts on the ransomware threat
landscape, and more. However, we should note that Aleks’ views are his
alone and may not necessarily represent those of the broader LockBit group.
Additionally, we cannot corroborate many of the claims he makes about the ease
of targeting certain geographic regions and entities.

Confirmed
theories
This information was
shared with us by Aleks
and confirms our previous
assessments.

•

While no longer active,
Maze was once a
franchise/affiliate
program.

•

A selection process
existed for Maze
and still does for LockBit.

•

LockBit has a profitsharing requirement that
the affiliate has to meet
for the first four or
five ransoms. This also
used to be the case for
Maze, which its actors
shut down in 2020.

•

Keeping your word to
the victim is an important
part of LockBit’s
business model.

Aleks’ life is kept busy by his underground criminal activity, but he also claims
to have legitimate interests and hobbies, including world history, culinary arts,
and music. These conversations were representative of the fact that this threat
actor, and others like him, lead seemingly normal lives that are filled with family
demands, work deadlines, and leisure activities.
We are confident that the threat actor is a male and resides in the Siberian region
of Russia and has probably been an active ransomware operator for at least
several years. We estimate that he is in his early 30s and believe that he has at
least a university-level education. Aleks claims he is self-taught in cyber-related
skills such penetration testing, network security and intelligence collection, both
open-source and in the cybercriminal underground. He has been studying and
training in IT since the 2000s, when the onset of widespread internet availability
sparked his initial interest in what was then a new technology. This included

Interview with a LockBit ransomware operator

network protocols and the entire line of dial-up protocols
(up to v42.bis), which allowed the use of old telephone dialup lines and a Motorola modem.
After gaining a good understanding of networks, Aleks
began to focus on the markup and scripting languages
such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, along with small web
frameworks like CodeIgniter. Subsequently, he began to
write plugins for these frameworks while also learning
how the databases are organized. He spent ample time
understanding particular issues within networks as well
as the technology behind them. Over time, Aleks’ strong
understanding of IT technologies helped him secure a job
at an IT company while finishing his college degree. After
graduation, he continued his work in the IT field.
Despite Aleks’ education and aptitude, he expressed a
general sense of disappointment, at times even resentment,
for not being properly appreciated within the Russian
cyber industry. His frustration was evident during our
conversations, with him disparaging several well-known
Russian cybersecurity companies. He also remarked
that, “In the West, I would probably work in white [hat
security] and earn easily…” suggesting that his perceived
underappreciation and low wages drove him to participate
in unethical and criminal behavior.
Aleks shared several examples of times he felt
underappreciated by his peers in the IT and cybersecurity
field. During his work, he periodically encountered various
security errors while setting up websites. He was naturally
curious about such unsecured sites that showed errors
or were not working properly. In these cases, he would
try to understand the problem and then notify the site’s
administrators to help fix the issue. However, he was often
met with complete disregard for both the problem itself and
his efforts to offer a solution. Aleks continued to experience
similar scenarios with other websites, including a wellknown Russian social networking site.
Based on our conversations, it was clear that Aleks was
frustrated with being unable to warn about vulnerabilities
and often felt like his well-intentioned efforts were ignored.
This became a significant motivator for him to pursue
unethical and/or criminal work. Recounting one such
experience, he told us, “I found a blind SQL injection on
a Russian website. I reported and no one reacted, so I
dropped it. I realized that our Big Brother (the Russian
one) doesn’t care about cybersecurity.” He surmised that
interactions like this encouraged researchers to find other

ways to use their skills for financial gain, suggesting many
are turning to illegal activities.
Aleks also shared his pessimistic view on bug bounty
programs in which vendors pay independent researchers
for finding bugs and vulnerabilities in their products.
According to him, there has been a strong tendency
recently to “deceive” people who report such security
flaws. He said that companies are making efforts to find
loopholes that allow them to forgo paying the researcher
based on technicalities in the completeness of their
report. However, this stands completely at odds with our
professional observations from the security community. It
may be the case that Aleks chooses to view vulnerability
programs through this lens to account for his own decision
to not participate in them or because he has heard
inaccurate stories from other threat actors.

RANSOMWARE OPERATIONS AND TTPS
Once Aleks made the decision to turn to illicit cyber activity,
he dabbled in several different types of attacks, including
attempting to compromise websites and distributed denialof-service (DDoS) attacks. He said he eventually settled on
ransomware because of its profitability and because it gave
him the opportunity to “teach” companies the consequence
of not properly securing their data.
Aleks’ personal background and desire to be compensated for
his skills influences not only his motivation for engaging in illicit
activity, as described above, but also his guiding principles
around how to carry out such operations. He attested to
having a moral code and personal convictions, including a
strong sense of patriotism, that influences his target selection.
Despite his claims, however, we found several instances in
which he made conflicting claims about his ethics and actual
conduct. For example, he told us that “for a cybercriminal,
the best country is Russia,“ while later explaining that he
will not target citizens of the former Soviet Union or “friends
of Russia,” such as entities within the People’s Republic
of China, a close Russian ally. Aleks also suggested that
entities in post-Soviet states are not as lucrative from an
operational perspective and therefore are not worth his time.
We believe that Aleks’ personal security is likely another factor
in his targeting choices, as attacking Russian entities would
probably put him at additional risk to retaliation. He went
on to note that companies within the United States and the
European Union “will pay quicker and more,” suggesting those
regions are where he focuses his targeting.

Figure 2: A redacted and translated portion of our conversation in which Aleks talked about ransomware payments in the U.S. and Europe.
(Editor’s note: We mistakenly referred to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as the “Sarbanes-Auxley Act [sp]” in this correspondence.)

Additionally, Aleks claims that he avoids targeting entities
related to health care, labor unions and education. He
criticized other ransomware operators that do not share
similar ethical views, saying “just because you are a criminal
doesn’t mean you have to stop being a human being.” In a
later conversation, he went further, adding that “if you are
attacking hospitals during COVID-19, you are a [expletive].”
Talos notes that although the Aleks claims to not attack health
care institutions, we have reason to believe this is not the
case. He shared information with us during our conversations
that presumably would only be known by those involved
in such operations, such as that “hospitals pay 80 to 90
percent of the time because they simply have no choice.”
Moreover, his impassioned denial about being involved in such
activity is somewhat suspicious and suggests he might be
overcompensating to hide potential falsehoods.
Regarding entities Aleks does target, he tends to focus on
IT firms that he thinks should be practicing better network
security. In our conversations, he made clear that he wanted
to “teach them” to employ better security measures. He
also has geographic preferences, noting that the Middle
East has many “easy” targets with “weak cybersecurity.” He
added that the EU is the most lucrative area, as Europeans
are very concerned with data privacy. Aleks noted that
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law plays
to his favor, as victim organizations are more likely to

pay ransoms for fear of facing legal consequences if the
compromise becomes public knowledge. The United States
is also lucrative, but, according to Aleks, its laws around
data breaches negatively affect the threat actor’s degree of
influence during a ransomware operation. In such situations,
he explained, the actor has less leverage since U.S. laws
require victim companies to publicly disclose breaches
anyway. (We note, however, that incentive to pay the
ransom might still exist regardless of any legal or regulatory
requirements if the victim believes it would avoid having
data leaked.) Given these differences, he prefers targeting
the EU, noting, “I do not like to work in the U.S. because
getting paid is harder there, the EU pays better and more.”
He added that if a victim organization has cyber insurance,
the ransom payment is “all but guaranteed.” This statement
aligns with current data showing that ransomware attacks
accounted for more than 40 percent of cyber insurance
payments in North America during the first half of 2020.
Aleks also revealed more technical components of his
ransomware operations, including many of his tactics and
tools. He uses common tools and malware that many other
malicious actors incorporate into their attack framework,
such as Masscan, Shodan, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz and
PowerShell, among others. He also uses informationgathering tools such as ZoomInfo to research possible

targets. Aleks suggested that the dark web provides a lot of
information on potential targets and their business details.
He claimed that ransomware operators can assess their
target’s worth by either finding stolen information about
the company on the dark web from a previous compromise
or from insiders at the target organization who sell this
information directly on these underground platforms.
Aleks also mentioned that he gains an operational
advantage from white hat research that reveals
new vulnerabilities and the common delay in users’
implementation of new protections. He takes advantage
of the gap in time between a vulnerability release and
subsequent patching, claiming, “We use white hat
research against them. As soon as a CVE is published,
we take advantage of it because it takes a long time for
people to patch.” Essentially, Aleks claims his operations
are successful because he is more agile than network
administrators by staying current on security news that
he incorporates into future attacks. While he lacks the
resources of a state actor that would allow him to carry out
more sophisticated, stealthy operations, he still maintains
an advantage over defenders due to his ability to act quickly
based on publicly available information.
Aleks emphasized that one of the most important aspects
of his operation is the trust he establishes with his victims.
He revealed that without “keeping your word,” it would be
impossible for him to continue his operations. This comes
into play when the ransomware victim pays. Aleks insisted
that he deletes the victim’s stolen information and never
reposts it. At the same time, however, Aleks said he will
also follow through with leaking the stolen information if the
victim does not meet their conditions.
We also talked extensively with Aleks about how he
believes LockBit and other groups execute and manage
their attacks. During this part of the interview, he shared
his perspective on executing an attack that many
researchers already see in the wild. In order to access the
victim’s network, ransomware operators first try to obtain
information about the victim’s domain space, including
details about the Autonomous System, IP address blocks,
or external access gateways that belong to the victim
organization. After that, attackers leverage virtual private
servers with bulletproof hosting providers and data centers
that are usually in Russia (because these providers do
not commonly respond to abuse notifications) to scan the
externally facing domain space and IP block of the victim’s
network. Aleks mentioned that operators use scanners such

as Masscan, Nmap, and other add-ons, such as RustScan,
that enhance scanning speed.
After identifying and confirming various accessible
services, such as RDP, a common next step of the attack
is using already-compromised accounts to login to the
victim organization. This is typically done by searching
for the victim’s data on the dark web and purchasing it to
attempt to log in as the organization’s user. If successful,
the operator escalates privileges by exploiting a known
vulnerability. According to Aleks, any useful information
about the victim system is collected and leveraged with
open-source tools such as winPEAS and linPEAS. These
are primarily leveraged to disable security features,
including damaging or disabling the antivirus driver and
disabling or bypassing antivirus solutions. These malicious
activities are initiated by a series of C2 commands.
Once persistence is established on the victim network, a
variety of follow-on attacks are executed. For example,
adversaries sometimes attack LLMNR and NBT-NS to
obtain the administrator’s hashed password, which is
then transmitted to the cloud. The operators will use
private cloud services found on the dark web to crack the
password. Sometimes, tools such as Google Colab and
Colabcat are also used during this process. At the same
time, an obfuscated stager (using the Artifact Kit or Shelter
Pro) is dropped into the random-access memory of the
victim machine, allowing the actors to avoid saving any
information in the file system. After that, pentesting tools
like Cobalt Strike are used to connect with the C3 Custom
Command and Control.
To connect the stager with the attacker’s C2 infrastructure,
various obfuscation parameters are employed using
Malleable C2 (in the case of Cobalt Strike), such as the
obfuscation of the user agent field. Next, attackers try to
collect as much information as possible about the network
using automated frameworks such as BloodHound. After
that, the ransomware is executed and the operators wait for
the victims to contact them.
We also discussed the general structure of the LockBit
group, which Aleks described as a business-oriented
process where communication is rapid and the dedication
to the bottom line is the ultimate goal. For example,
Aleks claims that he can directly communicate with the
LockBit development team and that he can publish victim
information directly to the LockBit blog. According to him,
he has privileged information about potential new features

that may be added to future versions of LockBit and has
the capability to provide technical feedback. During one of
our conversations in early September, Aleks claimed that
LockBit would be making updates to its ransomware soon.
The following month, security researchers from Sophos
published new findings indicating that LockBit had started
leveraging new methods to stay undetected, confirming our
subject’s claim and bolstering his credibility.
Aleks also spoke at length about other threat groups,
adding that he considered working with other ransomware
outfits but chose not to participate with them for several
reasons. He specified that the Maze group takes a
very high amount of the ransom that is paid — up to 35
percent — leaving operators with less desirable margins
compared to other ransomware groups. Aleks explained
that while LockBit does not “demand as much as Maze”
from their victims, they also have a better profit-sharing
ratio. Separately, he also mentioned that “REvil can make
your files unstable and Netwalker slows the system down
too much.” REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) is a highly
profitable ransomware group that makes money from
compromising lucrative targets and selling its ransomware
as a service to other cybercriminals. While Aleks generally
works alone, he communicates with other ransomware
groups through underground forums. He said the nature
of these relationships are business-like, with the actors
exchanging information on tactics, malware development,
and financially focused agreements.

CONCLUSION
At the time of this writing in in early December, we are
still in direct contact with Aleks through Jabber and we
continue to collect as much information as we can. In midOctober, Twitter suspended his @uhodiransomwar account
because it violated the Twitter Rules against publishing
stolen personal data of individuals.
Our interviews with Aleks gave us unique insight into
the human side of a threat actor and left us with several
valuable takeaways for executives and cybersecurity

leaders to consider. As a result of these interactions with
Aleks, we were able to confirm many common assumptions
about such threat actors, including their background and
motivations. Our conversations also revealed the ordinary
nature of cyber attacks, which, in this case, still rely heavily
on unpatched systems and simple tools.
One of our most interesting takeaways was Aleks’
decision-making process that led him to participate
in major cyber crimes, or at least the decision-making
process he wants us to believe he followed. It is not
unusual for criminals to view their own actions as justifiable
after the fact even if there was no real moral ambiguity
to the crime. In this case, the lack of jobs that meet his
satisfaction, appear to be the introductory course to
cybercrime. His feelings of underappreciation, resentment,
and economic incentive are common motivators of illicit
cyber activity, and his story, as portrayed to us, illustrates
how one could be driven toward cybercrime.
There appears to be an underlying contradiction in Aleks’
portrayal of his personal story in which he presents himself
as being guided by certain moral codes, while his actions
seem to be more opportunistic, financially motivated
and self-serving. This is not unusual, as criminals often
rationalize their actions to justify their crimes. Aleks’
judgement of other criminals is a good example of this, as
it seems he derides them to differentiate himself from their
bad behavior.
Based on our conversations with Aleks about LockBit,
we believe that the ransomware and its operations will
expand in the near future, as there does not seem to be
significant barriers to enter the market if one has certain
technical skills. Given that there appears to be dedicated
development and confirmed success of LockBit’s
operations, the group will most certainly attempt to
capitalize on Maze’s recent alleged retirement. Additionally,
the spike in remote working and distance learning due
to COVID-19 has increased the number of potentially
vulnerable victims, making the conditions for LockBit
and other ransomware operators even more favorable to
continue to expand their operations.
