New Campaign Abusing StackBlitz Tool to Host Phishing
Pages
zscaler.com/blogs/research/new-campaign-abusing-stackblitz-tool-host-phishing-pages

There are numerous tools available to help individuals create new, exciting webpages. And,
there seem to be just as many hackers looking to exploit these tools for their own gain.
Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabz Team came across various phishing campaigns that
leverage the StackBlitz tool, using the preboot library functionality that helps ease the
transition of the hosted webpage immediately from the server side to the client side.
StackBlitz is an online integrated development environment (IDE) where anyone can create
Angular JavaScript and React TypeScript projects that are immediately posted online.
Attackers have targeted this method to host phishing pages. The purpose of the preboot
library function is to help manage the transition of state from a server-generated web view
to a client-generated web view.
Figure 1 shows the working flow of the StackBlitz tool.

In this blog, we will describe the phishing attacks hosted using the StackBlitz tool and its
delivery vector in detail. We found these phishing URLs through our Threat Intelligence
collection framework as well as online submissions to ThreatLabZ team for review.
Spam method 1

In this case, the spam link will be delivered via Microsoft’s OneDrive shareware
service, pretending to be a document shared by a particular health organization.
Once the user clicks the download link, it redirects the user to the Outlook phishing page.

Figure 4 shows the page after the user clicks on the download button. It takes a little bit of
time to fetch the web page from the StackBlitz development server.

Finally, it lands to the Outlook phishing campaign, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 7 shows the source code of the hosted phishing page with the preboot library
functionality. As mentioned earlier, this library manages the user experience from the time
when a server view is visible until the client view takes over control of the page.

The function will be invoked from the (preview-d52be7f9f266a450f65cb.js) JavaScript.
Figure 8 shows the source code of the preview JavaScript.

Figure: 8: The (preview-d52be7f9f266a450f65cb) script invokes the preboot function.
While analyzing the preboot function, we also identified that the preboot library functionality
uses the CachedFetch() module to check if a cached copy of the page is available or not.

The preboot function returns the hosted webpage as a JSON file as shown in Figure 10.

Spam method 2:
In this case, the spam link will host a web page with a message stating that you received a
shared document with the associated document download link. Once the user clicks the
download link, it redirects them to the OneDrive phishing campaign.

Figure 13: The spam campaign with phishing link.
If the user clicks the download document button, it will redirect the user to the OneDrive
login phishing page (angular-ivy-aabnsh(.)stackblitz(.)io).

Figure 16 shows the source code of the hosted phishing campaign with the preboot library
functionality.

Figure 16: The source code of the hosted phishing page.
If the user unknowingly clicks any of the phishing login methods to view the document, it will
redirect the user to relevant phishing page.
Here, we clicked on the Office365 login method to view the document, which redirected us
to a webpage that looks exactly like a legit Office365 site.

Figure 17: The Office365 login phishing campaign.
As we mentioned earlier, the source code of the webpage will be common to all the
websites hosted using the StackBlitz tool, except for the URL link, which is passed as
parameter for the preboot function.

Here, we have accessed the hosted phishing campaign a second time to showcase the
working functionality of the CachedFetch() and observe the overall web traffic.

Once the login information has been entered by the user, the form will post the user’s
credential details to malicious sites that are operated by the cybercriminals.

Conclusion
Cybercriminals use tools, such as StackBlitz, to come up with smarter ways to start
phishing campaigns and make it harder for security vendors to detect such campaigns. The
Zscaler ThreatLabZ team is actively tracking these kinds of phishing attacks to ensure
coverage for and to keep our customer safe.
