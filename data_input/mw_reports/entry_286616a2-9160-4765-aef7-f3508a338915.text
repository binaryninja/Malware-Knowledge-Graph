Crypto-mining on a DNS server

The rise of crypto-currencies has fuelled cyber-crime in various ways. Bitcoin has facilitated
a range of criminal activities from money laundering to ransomware payments since its
release in 2009, leading to a spike in ransomware attacks which has been growing ever
since.
More directly, cyber-criminals often hack into company servers and exploit their processing
power to mine cryptocurrency, without the organization’s knowledge. This blog will explore a
real-life attack where an Internet-facing server was compromised and started mining Monero
coins.

Mining cryptocurrency on an Internet-facing server
At a small private company in the APAC region, an Internet-facing DNS server began to
receive multiple incoming RDP connections. They all came from rare destinations which had
never been seen on the network. Many were sent from external sources with the RDP
cookie, ‘hello’, indicating a brute-force attack.

Hours later, the device was seen connecting out to a known endpoint associated with cryptomining.
As both RDP and SMB ports on the device were open to the Internet, anomalous SMB
connections were seen as well shortly following the crypto-mining connections.

Open ports, open sesame
Internet-facing servers are subject to many external threats, especially if sensitive ports are
exposed. In this case, the attacker was able to gain a foothold through the DNS server
because both the RDP and SMB ports could receive connections. It is important therefore to
close communication to all external points which do not strictly need to be open.
Crypto-jacking continues to be a viable way for attackers to expend company resources in
order to speed up their mining operations. Especially with the popularity of cryptocurrencies
at the moment, we have observed a significant uptick in these types of threat.
The connections to the mining pool were identified by Darktrace’s AI without relying on any
known IoCs. Instead, Cyber AI recognized the anomalous nature of the external endpoints,
which were statistically rare for the server’s ‘pattern of life’.
If the threat had not been detected, the attacker would have continued to abuse the server
resources, resulting in latency issues for important processes. The server could also have
been subject to further malicious activity such as DDoS or ransomware.

Protecting a company’s gems
Crypto-mining is notoriously difficult to detect and can go on for months unnoticed. And it can
form just one phase of an attacker’s full plan to infiltrate a network — alongside moving
laterally and compromising additional devices. Open ports and siloed defenses pave the way
for an attacker to break into a system with little resistance.
Organizations need a mechanism for detecting unusual and sinister behavior once the threat
is inside. To this end, Darktrace’s evolving understanding of ‘normal’ across users, devices,
and peer groups enables it to detect the subtle signs of latent threats. And with Autonomous
Response, it responds at machine speed, neutralizing the threat before it has had the
chance to spread.
In this case, with Darktrace’s SOC team, the client was immediately made aware of the
activity and promptly took the device offline. A Proactive Threat Notification was sent as soon
as the attacker had commenced mining. Darktrace analysts then worked through the issue
with the customer until the crisis had been resolved.

Darktrace’s AI detects and responds to threats no matter where they come from – RDP
account compromise, misconfigured Internet-facing server, or sophisticated Hafnium-style
zero day. Furthermore, it provides much-needed visibility over the enterprise, identifying and
highlighting Internet-facing devices and any issues they may pose.
Thanks to Darktrace analyst Taylor Breland for his insights on the above threat find.
