MegaCortex Ransomware Spotted Attacking Enterprise
Networks

A new ransomware called MegaCortex (Trend

Micro detects this as RANSOM.WIN32.CORTEX.SM) has been reportedly deployed against
large corporate networks and workstations in the United States, Canada and parts of
Europe. Cybersecurity firm Sophos first reported a sharp spike in MegaCortex activity last
Friday noting that 47 attacks were stopped within 48 hours, which is two-thirds of all known
incidents involving this ransomware. This recent surge isn’t the earliest encounter with the
ransomware — the first known sample was uploaded on January in the public sharing site
VirusTotal.

How MegaCortex works
At least one victim reported that the attack originated from compromised domain controllers
inside the enterprise network, but it isn’t clear how the ransomware distributors gained
access to the networks.
After gaining access to the domain controller, the attackers configured it to distribute a batch
file, a renamed PsExec, and winnit.exe, which is one of the main executables of the
malware, to the rest of the computers on the network. After this step, they run the batch file
remotely. This file will terminate Windows processes as well as stop and disable services that
will interfere with the ransomware's routines.

The batch file then executes winnit.exe, the core malware file, during a specific time frame
and with specific Base64 argument. If executed properly, the malware will search files for
encryption and drop a ransom note. It will also extract a randomly-named DLL and execute it
with rundll32.exe. This DLL is the component that will encrypt the computer’s files. It will first
check if the file is accessible. If not, it will simply log the files. If it is accessible, the file will be
encrypted, the child DLL process will be terminated after a set number of file encryption
attempts, and the cycle will start again.
When encrypting the victim’s files, the ransomware will append the extension .aes128ctr.
According to Sophos, the ransomware will also generate a file with a .tsv extension and drop
it in the hard drive. The MegaCortex actors' ransom note instructs the users to submit this file
to them because it contains encrypted session keys needed for decryption. The ransom note
itself is a .txt file that doesn’t ask for the usual cryptocurrency payment, instead it demands
that victims buy the actor’s software.
In addition to the main payload, the malware also drops secondary components that security
researchers have identified as the Rietspoof malware, a delivery system used to drop
multiple payloads onto a device.

Defending against ransomware
Users and businesses are recommended to adopt best practices to defend against
ransomware: Regularly back up files, keep the system and applications updated, enforce the
principle of least privilege, and implement defense in depth — arraying security at each layer
of a company’s online perimeters, from gateways, networks, endpoints, and servers.
