EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
Throughout 2018,
the amount of activity targeting industrial control
systems (ICS) increased substantially. Dragos identified
three new activity groups adding to the five we discovered
in 2017. This is consistent with previous Dragos
assessments – as our capabilities in threat hunting and
identification of ICS-focused threats expand, we achieve
greater visibility into the threat landscape and can create
a more holistic picture of the threats, behaviors, and
tradecraft affecting ICS environments.
ICS security risk grew in 2018 even absent any destructive
attacks. This year, four major elements contributed
significantly to greater risk:
1) More numerous intrusions into ICS networks enabling
research and reconnaissance of ICS operations and
technology
2) Commodity malware and wormable ransomware
causing ICS infections
3) Infrastructure-targeting activity groups adopting
Living off the Land tactics and behaviors that bypass
traditional security protection mechanisms
4) The compromise of several industrial control
equipment manufacturers enabling potential supplychain threats and vendor-enabled access to ICS
networks
Adversaries using traditional malware and techniques
to make the jump from IT to operations continued
to be a major issue across ICS, including continued
WannaCry infections impacting ICS environments.
Olympic Destroyer,1 though not specifically targeted to
ICS, provided an example of how operational systems
may be impacted through future wormable malware that
avoids the use of exploits.

In 2018, Dragos identified three more activity groups
targeting ICS: ALLANITE, XENOTIME, and RASPITE, the
latter of which is linked to newly-identified behavior
targeting US electric utilities. ALLANITE targeting also
includes electric utilities in the US, in addition to UK
entities. XENOTIME, the activity group associated with
TRISIS, expanded its operations beyond the Middle
East and the Triconex safety instrumented system
including compromising several ICS manufacturers.
Dragos also identified new behaviors and victimology
from adversaries first discovered in 2017.
Dragos identified no new malware with life-threatening
or ICS-specific destructive capabilities. However,
numerous intrusions into ICS networks stole the
type of information that would be valuable to future
ICS-disruptive capabilities such as HMI screenshots
and process historian information. We anticipate
increased risk of operational losses due to incidental
malware infections in ICS environments; the results of
mishaps during initial intrusion and reconnaissance
operations within the OT realm; and new disruptive
attacks based on the results of increasing research
and reconnaissance activity. Malicious activity is
increasing, and it will have large impacts – but there
are people hard at work securing infrastructure to
defend against the growing threat landscape.
This year Dragos championed private sector collectives
like the Cyber Threat Alliance2 and government
cooperation to promote critical infrastructure
cybersecurity.3 Recognizing that smaller entities
provide an environment for adversaries to train and
prepare undetected, as well as localized attacks,
Dragos also began work on Neighborhood Keeper,4
a research and development effort done in concert
with the Department of Energy, Idaho National Labs,
the Electric ISAC, Ameren, First Energy, and Southern
Company, to bring affordable threat detection
technology and shared insight to a broader set of
infrastructure providers.
Further, Dragos provided a variety of public resources
including monthly webinars5 and ICS security training
for practitioners looking to expand their knowledge of
ICS and threats facing these industries.

equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and other
third-party OT players. Of all threats, the
following are the most concerning to Dragos.

Disruptive
IT Malware
IT malware impacting operations is not new or unique,6 and Dragos expects these types of infections will continue
to be prevalent for years to come due to ease of use, effectiveness within enterprise environments, and the widelyavailable nature of commodity malware.
WannaCry and wormable ransomware leveraging vulnerabilities detailed in Microsoft bulletin MS17-010 continues to
be a major threat to ICS. The MS17-010 vulnerabilities were first weaponized in May 2017, and despite patches being
available since spring of that year, many enterprises – especially those within the OT space – have not or cannot
update machines due to poor patch management, refusal to accept downtime, or system end-of-life considerations.
This remains a continuing threat. In August, an operational error during software installation at Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company caused a WannaCry infection and affected over 10,000 machines, leading to a financial impact
of at least $250 million.7
Olympic Destroyer — the malware known for causing a network disruption during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter
Olympic Games — represented another IT-focused malware with the potential to bridge the IT-ICS gap. Although not an
immediate threat to ICS networks, Olympic Destroyer provides an example for exploit-less propagation within a victim
network paired with a disruptive effect that could cause significant disruption in ICS environments.

Mid-point
Network Access
In May, researchers identified VPNFilter router malware targeting small office/home office (SOHO) network devices and
some commercial equipment that harvested information, stole credentials, and could cause a denial of service. While
this malware does not appear to be targeted towards ICS, a Ukrainian chemical plant reportedly identified VPNFilter8
on its network. The malware alone does not have destructive capabilities, however information gathered could further
lead to a damaging attack. SOHO equipment is sometimes connected to ICS environments in an out-of-band manner
without approval from IT departments, thus a VPNFilter infection could cause major issues.

Supply Chain/Third-party
Compromise
Third-party access to OT networks is a common and necessary component of modern operations. However, the OT
network access granted to vendors and others can also expose an asset operator to significant risk as compromises
can move from vendors’ networks to the asset operator’s network. Third-party or supply chain9 compromise leverages
explicit trust between parties and bypasses a large part of the security stack, potentially including perimeter defenses,
such as firewalls or proxy servers, to access a target. Once an adversary accesses the victim network, it is possible
to pivot throughout the network, steal credentials or other sensitive data, and further embed themselves within IT or
operations.
Most concerning to Dragos are several compromises of ICS vendors and manufacturers in 2018 by activity associated
with XENOTIME, providing potential supply chain threat opportunities and vendor-enabled access to asset owner and
operator ICS networks. We suspect that there are other unknown manufacturer/vendor compromises and that this trend
will continue because the value of such access is high. Other significant activity of interest involves the compromise of
legitimate websites enabling exploitation and access of networks when engineers and operators access these sites or
download legitimate-looking software (e.g., ICS watering holes).
In April, a business tool used by a number of energy firms for communication purposes experienced a cyber incident,10
exclusively affecting business communications across oil and gas and electric utility sectors. It forced a number of
energy companies to shut down communication connections and hampered data processing. Further underscoring
potential for third-party infections, the Department of Justice in December indicted11 alleged members of the APT 10
hacking group in part for accessing companies’ Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to gain access into primary victim
networks to steal sensitive information. Additionally, in August Schneider Electric alerted customers that some USB
media shipped with two Conext products may have been infected with unidentified malware during manufacturing by a
supplier.12 No customers publicly reported incidents of infection in this case.

Significant
TTPs
ICS-directed threat behavior continues to transition away from unique malware and vulnerabilities for most operations,
which is concerning because many OT security practices rely on anti-virus and vulnerability-based protection schemes
to reduce risk. Thus, their fundamental behavior becomes a key detection element for defense.
During earlier phases of operation threats increasingly use a methodology known as Living off the Land, leveraging
native system commands, applications, and software to gain access to the system and move throughout the network
undetected. Most ICS-impacting incidents still begin in an enterprise IT network although with the interconnection of
industrial environments to vendors, integrators, and others, it is important to note that the enterprise IT network the
compromise begins in may not belong to the organization that owns and operates the ICS. Living off the Land can allow
an adversary to execute behaviors ranging from conducting research to executing an attack on a target while evading
many signature- and blacklist-based detection methods. Living off the Land techniques encompass abuse of native
functionality and features in the ICS, such as operations of HMIs, and should not simply be considered the same Living
off the Land techniques common in enterprise IT security.
Five out of eight of the activity groups Dragos tracks use some Living off the Land techniques to accomplish earlyphase operations. While detecting commodity malware and Living off the Land techniques seems straightforward, it
often fails by traditional IT security approaches because of the complex nature and mission requirements of operations
environments. As anti-virus products, detection software, and other threat detection methods become more robust and
capable of detecting various malicious activity, adversaries must modify their methods to evade capture by blending in
with the environment and not leaving behind identifiable artifacts.
Dragos has also identified a growing trend of adversaries using open source or commercially-available penetration
testing tools in real-world campaigns. Mimikatz is the most popular and effective tool that lets adversaries capture
Windows credentials from system memory. Multiple activity groups, including ELECTRUM, ALLANITE, and DYMALLOY,
use Mimikatz, and major wormable malware including NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer with built-in Mimikatz-like
functionality for credential capture to propagate through infected networks. This tool can be leveraged for a pivot point
within the network and used for traversing the IT and ICS boundary. Other tools include penetration testing frameworks
Metasploit and PowerShell Empire, both of which contain versions of Mimikatz.
Later operational phases against ICS networks see the usage of ICS-specific knowledge, technology, processes, and
capabilities. Threats continue to require months-to-many years of dedicated ICS research and reconnaissance to
achieve any specific intent – hence our concern of the growing number of ICS intrusions which are the precursor to
any disruptive action. Later operational phases leverage ICS-specific technologies and protocols to interact with and
ultimately disrupt an industrial process. This means that a comprehensive ICS cybersecurity strategy must incorporate
ICS-specific defenses and IT cybersecurity mechanisms.
Other tools include penetration testing frameworks Metasploit and PowerShell Empire, both of which contain versions
of Mimikatz.

XENOTIME
XENOTIME is the group behind TRISIS, the destructive, ICS-tailored malware targeting Triconex safety instrumented
systems (SIS) in the Middle East. In 2018 Dragos identified new XENOTIME activity targeting entities in the US, and
devices beyond Triconex. While TRISIS would be difficult to replicate to other SIS’s, the malware provided a roadmap
for other adversaries to target these types of devices. In addition to customizing the malware specifically for the target
environment, the group uses stolen credentials to move between networks, legitimate but compromised servers for
communication, and some Living off the Land techniques.
Dragos identified TRISIS targeting an oil and gas facility in Saudi Arabia in the fall of 2017. It represented an escalation
of ICS attacks due to its targeting of safety systems that could lead to potential loss of life and physical damage.
XENOTIME has operated since at least 2014 and it is not currently linked to any other known groups. Dragos assesses
this is one of the most adept and notable ICS-targeting activity groups.

12

ALLANITE
In 2018, Dragos identified victims and attack methodology that sufficiently differentiated ALLANITE from other activity
groups. This group targets business and ICS networks in the US and UK electric utility sectors and maintains access to
understand the operational environment and for potential disruptive events.
ALLANITE uses phishing and compromised websites, called watering holes, for credential theft. Dragos assesses
the group’s operations are limited to information gathering and have not yet demonstrated disruptive capabilities.
ALLANITE avoids custom malware, instead utilizing Living off the Land techniques.
ALLANITE activity includes the Palmetto Fusion14 event described by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
In October 2017, a DHS advisory15 documented ALLANITE technical operations combined with activity with a group
Symantec calls Dragonfly 2.0 (the latter has links to the activity group Dragos tracks as DYMALLOY).

13

RASPITE
In August 2018, Dragos identified a new group targeting access operations in the US electric utility sector, with additional
victims in Saudi Arabia, Japan, and potentially Europe. The group appears active since at least mid-2017.
RASPITE compromises websites its targets are likely to visit in an attempt to gain initial access to victim networks.
Similar to ALLANITE and DYMALLOY, RASPITE will embed a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection and
steal Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to RASPITEcontrolled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine. The group shares similarities
with a group known as Leafminer by Symantec.
Despite demonstrating the steps necessary for initial intrusion into an IT network and potentially preparing a path
for an ICS event at a later time, there is no indication the group currently has a destructive capability that could, for
instance, cause energy sector disruptions.

14

DYMALLOY
In fall 2018, Dragos identified multiple new malware infections matching DYMALLOY’s behavior. These observations
may indicate a potential resurgence of DYMALLOY activity, or a different entity leveraging similar toolsets. This
discovery is concerning; the malware Dragos recently identified as part of new activity is only associated with known
intrusions into ICS networks.
The DYMALLOY activity group, associated with “Dragonfly 2.0,” uses methods such as spearphishing and watering
hole attacks for initial access, and commodity backdoors Goodor, DorShel, and Karagany for post-exploitation activity.
The group first emerged in late 2015, and was able to successfully compromise multiple ICS targets in Turkey, Europe,
and North America, including obtaining access to human machine interface (HMI) devices and stealing screenshots.

15

MAGNALLIUM
In 2018, MAGNALLIUM’s victimology expanded to additional targets, including entities in Europe and North America.
MAGNALLIUM used phishing emails purporting to be job advertisements relating to oil and gas companies to gain
access to victims’ machines. The group used publicly-available phishing kits to construct the emails’ contents, and
leveraged variants of the StoneDrill wiper and TURNEDUP malware family in infection events before transitioning to
PowerShell based post-exploitation tools in 2018.
Although the expansion is concerning, MAGNALLIUM’s capabilities appear to still lack an ICS-specific capability, and
remain focused on initial IT compromise and information gathering.
Dragos identified MAGNALLIUM in 2017 and determined that the group targeted IT operations at petrochemical and
aerospace manufacturers since at least 2013. The group initially targeted Saudi Arabian energy firms and an aircraft
holding company, but new intelligence suggests the group is expanding their targeting.

16

ELECTRUM
In summer 2018, Dragos identified multiple samples of a malicious tool previously associated with ELECTRUM’s 2016
CRASHOVERRIDE event in Ukraine. Although some samples of this tool had been previously identified “in the wild,” this
tool is only associated with ELECTRUM activity. Dragos also identified new intelligence providing additional information
into ELECTRUM infiltration techniques and the capabilities of the CRASHOVERRIDE malware.
The group does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities, instead leveraging common exploitation behaviors and tools,
including Mimikatz. Our intelligence indicates that the group remains active and is no longer focusing exclusively on
Ukraine.

17

CHRYSENE
Dragos uncovered multiple samples of CHRYSENE-related malware and other activity this year, indicating the group
remains active and is evolving in more than one area, including revising and updating its malicious software toolkit.
CHRYSENE aims to evade existing anti-virus and other detection mechanisms.
CHRYSENE developed from an espionage campaign which first appeared on the public’s radar after the destructive
SHAMOON cyberattack in 2012 impacting Saudi Aramco. The activity group targets petrochemical, oil, gas, and electric
generation sectors and has shifted targeting outside the Gulf Region.

18

COVELLITE
COVELLITE compromised networks associated with electric energy, primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North America.
The group lacks an ICS-specific capability at this time. Dragos identified COVELLITE activity targeting US electric
utilities in 2017.
While technical activity linked to COVELLITE behaviors exist in the wild, there has been no evidence or indications
this group remains active from an ICS-targeting perspective, nor has Dragos identified new activity against electric
infrastructure specifically.

RECOMMENDATIONS

DEFENDING THE
ENTIRE KILL
CHAIN

Organizations can lower their risk profiles and
proactively
protect
against
common
attack
techniques by performing security best practices.
Implement proper security hygiene and the principle
of least privilege based on a deep knowledge of the
environment. For instance: question whether tools
like PSExec are necessary for every user; use access
control lists and restrict administration rights across
all devices; prohibit OT devices, including engineering
workstations, from connecting to the internet or email
services wherever possible; and ensure employees are
trained to identify and report phishing and malicious
activity. Additionally, increase visibility into host
and ICS processes as a means to identify
suspicious behavior within otherwise
legitimate
processes,
such
as
PowerShell execution resulting
in network connectivity.

DEFENDING THE
ENTIRE KILL CHAIN
Defending against a dynamic threat landscape requires adopting a “Whole of Kill Chain”16 approach, keying in on
adversary behaviors from the initial intrusions through second-stage impacts. Defenders can use a mix of modern
threat detection strategies including indicator- or behavior-based methods, or approaches relying on modeling and
configuration.17 Diversifying threat detection strategies can help asset owners and operators identify threats earlier,
and achieve greater visibility into potential threats.

LEVERAGE THREAT
BEHAVIOR ANALYTICS
As adversaries increasingly adopt Living off the
Land and ICS-specific techniques, leveraging Threat
Behavior Analytics (TBA) – or identifying patterns
in behavior and malicious activity alongside static
operations – can help improve identification of
malicious activity within the environment. Dragos
develops TBAs18 to help define activity groups,
providing analytic identifiers that allow defenders to
detect malicious behavior holistically, regardless of
whether the individual indicators of compromise (IOCs)
relating to the analytic change in different attacks.

UNDERSTAND AND
ANTICIPATE THREATS
ICS threat intelligence can give asset owners and
operators actionable information to anticipate and
defend against threats by providing visibility into
the current landscape, trends, and targeting. Threat
intelligence combines information from various sources
and expert assessments to form conclusions that
decision-makers can use to implement vertical-specific
controls that result in effective security postures.

23

COMBATING FEAR,
UNCERTAINTY, AND DOUBT
Dragos frequently receives feedback that ICS security practitioners take weeks or months to address FUD, or fear,
uncertainty, and doubt, caused by misreported or misunderstood incidents. Addressing FUD keeps them from actually
defending networks, thereby making ICS security worse by a significant margin.
For instance, in July, the media reported19 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publicly disclosed Russian
hacking activity targeting US electric utilities. But the article contained previously-reported information: activity linked
to the DYMALLOY and ALLANITE activity groups. This reporting and the exaggerated statements reported within
continued coverage generated concern because it was not clear that the activity and had been known for some time.
As the scope and number of reported threats or cyberattacks against ICS entities expands, it’s important to ensure a
realistic understanding of what malicious activity organizations in the electric, oil and gas, manufacturing, aerospace,
and a variety of other industries face. Industrial infrastructure is defensible, and destructive attacks are difficult to
execute and scale. Further, while numerous, incidental malicious activity commonly occurs in industrial networks (like
commodity malware or phishing attacks), ICS-specific or ICS-tailored malware remains rare.

19. https://dragos.com/blog/20180806ElectricGridThreats.html

CONCLUSION
This year Dragos expects to identify more activity targeting ICS,
due to greater visibility into OT networks and adversary behavior
driven by ICS threat intelligence. Adversaries will continue to bridge
IT and OT networks leveraging traditional malware and Living off
the Land techniques, while largely avoiding the use of zero-days.
We anticipate growing our list of publicly-tracked adversaries and providing
our customers the most in-depth and intelligence-driven ICS threat analysis.
Dragos will continue our efforts to bring ICS cybersecurity resources to all
levels and encourage collaboration across all sectors to ensure a greater
understanding of the threats these industries face and how to combat them.
