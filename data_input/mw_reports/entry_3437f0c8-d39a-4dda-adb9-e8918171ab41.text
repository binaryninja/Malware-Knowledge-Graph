A number of organizations in Ukraine have been hit by a cyberattack that involved new
data-wiping malware dubbed HermeticWiper and impacted hundreds of computers on their
networks, ESET Research has found. The attack came just hours after a series of
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) onslaughts knocked several important websites in the
country offline.
Breaking. #ESETResearch discovered a new data wiper malware used in Ukraine
today. ESET telemetry shows that it was installed on hundreds of machines in the
country. This follows the DDoS attacks against several Ukrainian websites earlier

Detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NCV, the data wiper was first spotted just
before 5 p.m. local time (3 p.m. UTC) on Wednesday. The wiper’s timestamp, meanwhile,
shows that it was compiled on December 28th, 2021, suggesting that the attack may have
been in the works for some time.
HermeticWiper misused legitimate drivers of popular disk management software. “The
wiper abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software in order to
corrupt data,” according to ESET researchers.
Additionally, the attackers used a genuine code-signing certificate issued to a Cyprus-based
company called Hermetica Digital Ltd., hence the wiper’s name.
It also appears that at least in one case, the threat actors had access to a victim’s network
before unleashing the malware.

Earlier on Wednesday, a number of Ukrainian websites were knocked offline in a fresh
wave of DDoS attacks that have been targeting the country for weeks now.
In the middle of January, another data wiper swept through Ukraine. Called WhisperGate,
the wiper masqueraded as ransomware and brought some echoes of the NotPetya attack
that hit Ukraine in June 2017 before causing havoc around the world.
