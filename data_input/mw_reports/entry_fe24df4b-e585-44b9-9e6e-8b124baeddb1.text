Iran-Based Threat Actor Exploits VPN Vulnerabilities
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-259a

Summary
This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat
actor techniques.
This product was written by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with
contributions from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). CISA and FBI are aware of an
Iran-based malicious cyber actor targeting several U.S. federal agencies and other U.S.based networks. Analysis of the threat actor’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicates a correlation with the group known by the
names, Pioneer Kitten and UNC757. This threat actor has been observed exploiting several
publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) dealing with Pulse Secure
virtual private network (VPN), Citrix NetScaler, and F5 vulnerabilities. This threat actor used
these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to targeted networks and then maintained access
within the successfully exploited networks for several months using multiple means of
persistence.
This Advisory provides the threat actor’s TTPs, IOCs, and exploited CVEs to help
administrators and network defenders identify a potential compromise of their network and
protect their organization from future attacks.

Technical Details
CISA and FBI are aware of a widespread campaign from an Iran-based malicious cyber
actor targeting several industries mainly associated with information technology, government,
healthcare, financial, insurance, and media sectors across the United States. The threat
actor conducts mass-scanning and uses tools, such as Nmap, to identify open ports. Once
the open ports are identified, the threat actor exploits CVEs related to VPN infrastructure to
gain initial access to a targeted network. CISA and the FBI have observed the threat actor
exploiting multiple CVEs, including CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-11539, CVE-2019-19781,
and CVE-2020-5902.
After gaining initial access to a targeted network, the threat actor obtains administrator-level
credentials and installs web shells allowing further entrenchment. After establishing a
foothold, the threat actor’s goals appear to be maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.
This threat actor has been observed selling access to compromised network infrastructure in

1/10

an online hacker forum. Industry reporting indicates that the threat actor operates as a
contractor supporting Iranian government interests, but the malicious activity appears to also
serve the threat actor’s own financial interests. The FBI notes this threat actor has the
capability, and likely the intent, to deploy ransomware on victim networks.
CISA and FBI have observed this Iran-based threat actor relying on exploits of remote
external services on internet-facing assets to gain initial access to victim networks. The
threat actor also relies heavily on open-source and operating system (OS) tooling to conduct
operations, such as ngrok; fast reverse proxy (FRP); Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) directory browser; as well as web shells known as ChunkyTuna, Tiny, and China
Chopper.
Table 1 illustrates some of the common tools this threat actor has used.
Table 1: Common exploit tools
Tool

Detail

ChunkyTuna
web shell

ChunkyTuna allows for chunked transfer encoding hypertext transfer
protocol (HTTP) that tunnels Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) streams
over HTTP. The web shell allows for reverse connections to a server with
the intent to exfiltrate data.

Tiny web
shell

Tiny uses Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) to create a backdoor. It has the
capability to allow a threat actor remote access to the system and can also
tunnel or route traffic.

China
Chopper
web shell

China Chopper is a web shell hosted on a web server and is mainly used
for web application attacks; it is configured in a client/server relationship.
China Chopper contains security scanners and can be used to upload files
and brute-force passwords.

FRPC

FRPC is a modified version of the open-source FRP tool. It allows a system
—inside a router or firewall providing Network Address Translation—to
provide network access to systems/operators located outside of the victim
network. In this case, FRPC was used as reverse proxy, tunneling Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS), giving the
threat actor primary persistence.

Chisel

Chisel is a fast TCP tunnel over HTTP and secured via Secure Shell
(SSH). It is a single executable that includes both client and server. The
tool is useful for passing through firewalls, but it can also be used to
provide a secure form of communication to an endpoint on a victim
network.

ngrok

ngrok is a tool used to expose a local port to the internet. Optionally,
tunnels can be secured with TLS.

2/10

Tool

Detail

Nmap

Nmap is used for vulnerability scanning and network discovery.

Angry IP
Scanner

Angry IP Scanner is a scanner that can ping a range of Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses to check if they are active and can also resolve hostnames,
scan ports, etc.

Drupwn

Drupwn is a Python-based tool used to scan for vulnerabilities and exploit
CVEs in Drupal devices.

Notable means of detecting this threat actor:
CISA and the FBI note that this group makes significant use of ngrok, which may
appear as TCP port 443 connections to external cloud-based infrastructure.
The threat actor uses FRPC over port 7557.
Malware Analysis Report MAR-10297887-1.v1 details some of the tools this threat
actor used against some victims.
The following file paths can be used to detect Tiny web shell, ChunkyTuna web shell, or
Chisel if a network has been compromised by this attacker exploiting CVE-2019-19781.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework
Initial Access
As indicated in table 2, the threat actor primarily gained initial access by using the publicly
available exploit for CVE-2019-19781. From there, the threat actor used the Citrix
environment to establish a presence on an internal network server.

CISA currently has no evidence of data exfiltration from this threat actor but assesses that it
was likely due to the use of 7-Zip and viewing of sensitive documents.

Mitigations
Recommendations
CISA and FBI recommend implementing the following recommendations.
If your organization has not patched for the Citrix CVE-2019-19781 vulnerability, and a
compromise is suspected, follow the recommendations in CISA Alert AA20-031A.
This threat actor has been observed targeting other CVEs mentioned in this report;
follow the recommendations in the CISA resources provided below.
If using Windows Active Directory and compromise is suspected, conduct remediation
of the compromised Windows Active Directory forest.
If compromised, rebuild/reimage compromised NetScaler devices.
Routinely audit configuration and patch management programs.
Monitor network traffic for unexpected and unapproved protocols, especially outbound
to the internet (e.g., SSH, SMB, RDP).
Implement multi-factor authentication, especially for privileged accounts.
Use separate administrative accounts on separate administration workstations.
Implement the principle of least privilege on data access.
Secure RDP and other remote access solutions using multifactor authentication and
“jump boxes” for access.
9/10

Deploy endpoint defense tools on all endpoints; ensure they work and are up to date.
Keep software up to date.
