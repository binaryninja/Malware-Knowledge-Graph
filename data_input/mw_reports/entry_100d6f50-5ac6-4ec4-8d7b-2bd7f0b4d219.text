on the topic.
On October 15th, the United States filed an indictment against six Russian nationals accused
of being hackers with Russian military intelligence (GRU). These six men, per the indictment,
were involved in a number of high-profile cyberattacks, with targets including French
President Emmanuel Macron’s election campaign, the Winter Olympics, Ukrainian energy
infrastructure, the UN’s chemical watchdog (OPCW), and others.

In 2018, the Netherlands and United Kingdom issued a similar cache of information about a
number of GRU hackers involved some of the same cyberattacks. In both this week’s and
the 2018 disclosure of the identities of GRU hackers, the incompetence of the Russian state
and its information security becomes quite clear: many of these secretive hackers have
registered their vehicles to their workplace in Moscow, that is to say to the publicly accessible
address of GRU military units. By running simple queries in widely available leaked
databases showing Moscow Oblast vehicle registration data, we can easily discover the
identities of dozens of additional hackers who registered their vehicles to the same nonexistent Moscow address.
Indicted Hackers at Svobody
When searching the names of three of the six indicted hackers, we found that they have all
registered their vehicles to the same address: Svobody 21В [referring the the Russian “в”,
the third letter of the alphabet, not the English “b”]. It is important to note that none of these
hackers actually live at this address — which would make it a very crowded communal
apartment. Rather they simply used their workplace as a vehicle registration address, as is
done by many Russians serving in the military. In this case, the GRU’s military unit 74455
operates out of the address Svobody 21.
The biographical information in this leaked vehicle registration database matches the
information in the FBI warrants for Pavel Frolov, Pyotr Pliskin and Anatoly Kovalev, except
for the FBI noting Pliskin’s date of birth as August 6, instead of August 26. This indicates
either an error on the FBI’s part, or a typo in the leaked database.
Kovalev was previously indicted in 2018 along with 11 other GRU hackers linked to the same
military unit 74455.
As detailed by The Insider, the vehicle of another of the six indicted hackers, Yuri Andrienko,
is registered to a different known GRU address — Khoroshevskoe 76B.

A Hacker Registry
Conducting a wider search by an address on the same leaked Moscow vehicle registration
database returns dozens of other people — all born between 1978 and 1998 — who
registered their vehicles to the same Svobody 21 address. While there are slight variations in
the data, it is safe to assume that all of these people are somehow connected to the GRU.
In sum, there are :

3/4

38 people registered to Svobody 21 В
Six people registered to Svobody 21 В Ч (V Ch)
Five people registered to Svobody 21 ВЧ (VCh)
The eleven people who registered their address to the non-existent apartments at Svobody
21 ВЧ and В Ч, instead of just В (also non-existent), likely refers to the Russian abbreviation
for “military unit” — в/ч (войсковая часть or voyskovaya chast’).
Of these 49 people registered to this GRU-associated address:
38 are men, 11 are women [some of the people registered at this address could be the
spouse of a GRU officer and just have the vehicle registered in their name, but it is
highly likely that the majority of these 49 people are directly associated with the GRU
themselves]
The average birth year is 1988, making the approximate average age 32 years old
The youngest person listed to the GRU military unit’s address was born in 1998 (22
years old), while the oldest was born in 1978 (42 years old).
Except for the three hackers indicted this week, none of the other 46 individuals with a
Svobody 21 vehicle registration have been publicly named or indicted by any Western
country.
