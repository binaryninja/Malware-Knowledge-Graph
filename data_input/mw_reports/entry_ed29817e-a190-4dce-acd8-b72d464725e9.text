The military doctrine of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea relies heavily on
deliberate deception and denial operations. Their cyber capabilities despite the banning of
any internet services all over the state, apart from their native intranet “Kwangmyong”, has
been said to be rather longitudinal; it has gained notoriety for its past hacking activities, most

remarkably the attacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the Bangladesh
bank heist in 2016, cryptocurrency and bank heists, and ransomware attacks. Of course,
there is no way to cross-reference or verify whether its deliberate dissemination or accurate
information. So, relying on any open-source information can result in an echo chamber effect
of establishing them as evidential facts.
North Korea’s existing political and military strategies can help provide context for
understanding its cyber strategy. Traditionally, they have relied on a system of asymmetrical
and irregular combination of warfare to sidestep the conventional military deadlock in the
peninsula. Cyber capabilities would provide for a risk-minimized means of exploiting USA
and ROK vulnerabilities at a low intensity. During peacetime, this can allow them to upset the
status quo by using cost-effective strategies to target USA and ROK command control,
computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) in support of their “quick
war, quick end” strategy.
Since the 1990s, the DPRK has come a long way in terms of cyber warfare, when the
computer infrastructure was rudimentary at best. Kim Jong-il recognized the value of cyber
capabilities back then, which gave North Korea ample time to recruit and train human
resources and invest in institutions to develop and sustain the country’s assets in
cyberspace.DPRK’s priorities in the realm of information and communications technology
(ICT) are embedded in the leadership’s national strategy, which is essentially composed of
two main parts: national security and economic development. It is no different from any other
state, except that the type of regime, division of the two Koreas, and its external environment
presents several threats and challenges that affect its cyber posture.

Korea, whose government is the only one on earth known to conduct nakedly criminal
hacking for monetary gain, has run schemes in some hundred and fifty nations. Illustration by

When in 2009, the US National Intelligence Estimate dismissed North Korea, noting it would
take years to develop them into a meaningful threat. Yet right around that time, that same
year, North Korea reportedly unified all of its intelligence and internal security services and
brought them under the direct control of the National Defense Commission to cement the
control of current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. It merged intelligence organizations and
its various cyber units such as Bureau 121 into the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).
It later became their primary foreign intelligence service, and headquarters for cyber
operations. In 2013, the RGB reportedly also established Unit 180, tasked with hacking
international financial institutions to extract foreign currency in support of North Korea’s
nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It would also install malicious backdoors in software

development businesses in Japan and China. Over the years, the focus of Unit 180 shifted
toward targeting cryptocurrency exchanges while Bureau 121 has expanded its cyber
operations beyond South Korea by attacking foreign infrastructure elsewhere.

North Korea’s cyber operations reflect at least three distinct characteristics. First, North
Korea’s cyber units and hacker groups have shown considerable diversity in terms of their
capabilities and experience. The line between low-end and high-end North Korean
cyberspace operations has frequently been blurred. North Korea can employ non-state
actors as surrogates, utilise low-cost, off-the-shelf tools that are freely available and exploit
known techniques such as denial of service attacks.
Second, North Korea has gradually demonstrated a resolve for cyber-escalation, targeting
the critical infrastructure of other nation-states as well as private corporations and banks for
varying political motivations. Increasingly, it also aims to achieve illicit financial gain by
bypassing international sanctions and generating foreign currency.
Third, the essential ‘dialectics of North Korea’s cyberspace’ is asymmetric. Its internet
infrastructure is isolated from global networks, with the country’s entire internet traffic
channelled through only two providers — China’s Unicom and Russia’s TransTeleCom. The
country is largely unplugged from the global internet and is ringfenced by China’s ‘Great
Firewall’.

North Korean hacker groups have therefore been widely dispersed places elsewhere, such
as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and even Europe, acting independently or mutually
supporting each other based on their specific cyber missions.
Thus, it is safe to say that the cyber operations carried out by North Korea are not ad hoc,
isolated incidents. They are the accumulation of carefully planned efforts under the direction
of preexisting organizations that directly support the country’s national strategy. Knowing
which organizations do this, is extremely crucial because they do not have a published cyber
doctrine. The Reconnaissance General Bureau and General Staff Department of the Korean
People’s Army generally control most of North Korea’s known cyber capabilities ranging from
peacetime provocations to wartime disruptive operations.

North Korea has spearheaded fraudulent cyber operations to circumvent sanctions, gaining
access to the international financial system and illegally forcing the transfer of funds from
financial institutions, SWIFT banking networks, and cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. At
the same time, North Korea also has been able to protect its critical infrastructure from
potential reprisals, limiting its access, dependencies, and vulnerabilities on the internet and
communication networks by relying instead primarily on China’s internet infrastructure. This
has been augmented only recently with a second internet link to Russian networks, and
dispersion of its hackers to select countries worldwide, including India, Nepal, Kenya,
Mozambique, and Indonesia.
Consequently, North Korea’s 21st-century cyber operations have essentially become
weapons of mass effectiveness working alongside the weapons of mass destruction in its
nuclear arsenal, together composing a unified asymmetric political strategy designed to
pressure the United States and the wider international community to recognize as legitimate
Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un’s interpretation of North Korea’s sovereignty and security.
Lately, Kim Jong Un has quietly built a 7,000-man cyber army that gives North Korea an
edge nuclear weapons does not.
As Kim reportedly declared in 2013, “cyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and
missiles, is an ‘all-purpose sword’ that guarantees our military’s capability to strike
relentlessly.”
