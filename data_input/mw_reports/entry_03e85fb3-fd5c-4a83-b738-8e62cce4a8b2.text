The BlackByte ransomware group is striking users all
over the globe
blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/the-blackbyte-ransomware-group-is.html

News summary
Cisco Talos has been monitoring the BlackByte Ransomware Group for several months,
infecting victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, Netherlands,
China, Mexico and Vietnam.
The FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022 warning about this
group, stating that the group has targeted at least three critical infrastructure sectors in
the U.S.
Talos has monitored ongoing BlackByte attacks dating back to March.
BlackByte updated its leak site with a new design and new victims and is still actively
exploiting victims worldwide.

Executive overview
The BlackByte ransomware group uses its software for its own goals and as a ransomware-asa-service offering to other criminals. The ransomware group and its affiliates have infected
victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, the Netherlands, China, Mexico
and Vietnam. Talos has been monitoring BlackByte for several months and we can confirm
they are still active after the FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022.
Additionally, BlackByte is considered part of the big game ransomware groups, which are
targeting large, high-profile targets, looking to exfiltrate internal data and threatening to
1/7

publicly release it. Like similar groups, they have their own leaks site on the darknet. The
actual TOR address of this site is frequently moved. Below, you can see a screenshot of the
site. We have anonymized the screenshot to protect victims' privacy.

The attack usually starts with a network entry point, either a previously compromised host or
a software vulnerability which is exploitable from the network. The former compromised
host elevates local and domain account privileges and moves laterally by using standard
penetration testing and legit administrator tools (LoLBins). In most incidents, they like to
use the AnyDesk remote management software to control victim machines.

Technical details
The BlackByte gang often uses phishing and/or vulnerable unpatched applications or
services like vulnerable versions of SonicWall VPN or the ProxyShell vulnerability in
Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to the victim's network. These are usually known
public vulnerabilities that the targets haven't patched in a timely manner. Due to a lack of
logs, we could not confirm the initial infection vector in the case below, but we have
indicators that a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server was compromised, which matches
the previously described behavior of the BlackByte actor.
A typical timeline of infection looks similar to the anonymized log below, which we saw in
our telemetry in March.

The logs above show the adversaries are installing the AnyDesk remote management
software, as we've seen in Cisco Talos Incident Response engagements. BlackByte seems to
have a preference for this tool and often uses typical living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins),
besides other publicly available commercial and non-commercial software like 'netscanold' or
'psexec'. These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be
difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual
ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves
persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts.
Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages
of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but
the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game
ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The
chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we've transcribed below provides an
idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with
ransomware actors in a future post.
Victim: "How many files are stolen? and can you share some file names?"
Hive: "Hello"
Victim: "maybe no ones here"
Hive: "To decrypt your files you have to pay $20,000,000 in Bitcoin."
Victim: "that's way too much, can you please discount and please share the hash of the
ransomware file so we can at least black list it. You have already stolen everything anyway"
Hive: "We don't provide any hashes. Every time the software is unique. There is no need of
hashes here. It will not help anyway."
Hive: "If you want a discount I would like to see for how much"

Assuming that RANDOMNAME.EXE -a <SUSPICIOUS NUMBER> is the start of the
ransomware infection process, they have slightly changed their behavior or are just using a
different packer. The FBI document states "complex.exe -single <SHA256>" launches the
infection process. In our case, the parameters are different â€” the first one is a '-a' and the
following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like '42269874' (not the real
number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an
offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be
very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows
Defender. The base64-obfuscated string 'VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA' decodes to

4/7

'WinDefend', which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth's
Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI
document.
Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine
reboots and the ransomware note "BlackByteRestore.txt" is shown to the user via Notepad.

Conclusion
Talos research and other public reports about BlackByte are mainly pointing to vulnerable,
outdated systems as the initial infection vector. This threat shows how important it is to have
a proper update strategy in place. If your organization is running a Microsoft Exchange
Server or any other internet-facing system, make sure it always has the latest patch in place.
The time window between the announcement of a new security vulnerability and its
weaponization and use by criminals is getting smaller every year.
It's more important now than ever to have a multi-layered security architecture to detect
these types of attacks. The adversary is likely to manage to bypass one of the other
cybersecurity measures, but it is much harder for them to bypass all of them. These
campaigns and the refinement of the TTPs used will likely continue for the foreseeable
future.
