Threat actors used a remote access trojan with keylogging capabilities rather than traditional
point-of-sale malware Monday, November 28, 2016 By: Incident Response Team

During an incident response engagement in September 2016,
SecureWorks® incident response analysts observed payment card
data being collected by a generic remote access trojan (RAT) rather
1/3

than typical memory-scraping malware.
In many payment card data breaches, a point-of-sale (POS) system is infected with malware
that searches for specific processes in memory known to store card data in plain text. The
malware copies card data from the running processes, a technique known as memory
scraping, to encoded files on disk. These files are then transmitted to a threat actor, often
over commonly open ports 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS). The threat actor sells the card
data or uses it for fraudulent purchases.
In the September 2016 incident, SecureWorks analysts observed card data being collected
by the NetWire RAT instead of traditional POS malware. NetWire has a built-in keylogger that
can capture inputs from peripheral devices such as USB card readers. The attack
methodology is very similar to traditional POS malware. A threat actor sends a phishing
email with a malicious attachment to an employee working on a POS computer. If the
employee opens the attachment, malware to harvest card data is downloaded or installed.
Without proper security protections in place, these infections can remain undetected for
months or years.
Keyloggers expose more than just card data; credentials for online accounts and applications
such as email, property management systems (PMS), and Internet browsers are at risk.
Other sensitive information typed by the user, including Social Security numbers, phone
numbers, addresses, and birthdates, can also be compromised. Using a RAT with keylogging
capabilities, a threat actor could gather necessary information to commit identify theft and
further compromise an organization’s network. The generic NetWire RAT variant used in this
incident did not contain specific capabilities to target POS systems.

NetWire Details
The NetWire RAT variant observed by SecureWorks analysts has the file description
“TeamViewer 10” (see Table 1); however, this binary is not associated with the legitimate
TeamViewer application.

Table 1. NetWire RAT binary details.
Upon execution, the “Windows Folder.exe” file copies itself to C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming and creates a Windows shortcut (LNK) file in the victim’s
Startup directory as a persistence mechanism. The Microsoft Autoruns for Windows tool

2/3

reveals the autostart mechanism that the NetWire RAT creates and uses (see Figure 1). This
persistence mechanism ensures that NetWire launches automatically when the victim logs
into the system.

The “Windows Folder.exe” executable spawns and injects code into the legitimate
notepad.exe Windows process (see Figure 2). Process injection helps the malware avoid
detection; however, review of active network connections show notepad.exe communicating
to 185 . 35 . 138 . 227 over port 4588. The notepad.exe process should never have an active
network connection.

NetWire logs keystrokes and peripheral inputs into encoded files in the C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\Tobe directory. Encoded files observed by SecureWorks
analysts have a nomenclature of DD-MM-YYYY. SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU)
researchers developed a decoder for these keylogger output files and discovered sensitive
information such as track one and track two card data, as well as plain text credentials. The
files also display the window title of the opened application, which reveals which application
and website the sensitive information was entered. Figure 3 shows an example of a decoded
keylogger output.

Conclusion
Payment card data breaches can cause significant financial and reputational damages for an
organization, and can lead to restrictions imposed by compliance bodies and loss of future
business. Prevention and detection is critical to ensure that threats to customer data are
prevented or detected. Traditional antivirus software and other systems that rely on low-level
indicators do not effectively detect and block common and pervasive malware. Organizations
should apply endpoint detection mechanisms that apply behavioral analysis and human
intelligence to detect threat actor activity.
