Attribution
In this APT, the threat actor was very aware of the risks of exposure and tried to combat
attribution as much as possible. This is often the case in this type of large-scale cyber
espionage operations. At the time of the attack, there weren’t many classic indicators of
compromise (IOCs) that could lead to attribution. However, at the same time, the threat actors
behind Operation Cobalt Kitty left enough “behavioral fingerprints” to suspect the involvement of
the OceanLotus Group (which also goes by the names APT-C-00, SeaLotus and APT32),
which was first documented by Qihoo 360's SkyEye Labs in 2015 and further researched by
other security companies, including FireEye’s report. Reports of the group’s activity in Asia date
back to 2012, attacking Chinese entities. Over the years, the group was observed attacking a
wide spectrum of targets in other Asian countries (Philippines and Vietnam). Cybereason
concludes that the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed throughout operation
Cobalt Kitty are consistent with the group’s previous APT campaigns in Asia.
The Lotus Group appears to have a tendency of using similar and even identical names for their
payloads (seen in their PowerShell payloads, Denis backdoor and fake Flash installers). In
addition, they also used similar anonymization services for their domains repeatedly. That type
of “small” details also played a role in attributing Operation Cobalt Kitty to the OceanLotus
Group.
Lastly, during the investigation, Cybereason noticed that some of the C&C domains and IPs
started to emerge on VirusTotal and other threat intelligence engines, with payloads that were
not observed during Cobalt Kitty. This was a cutting proof that Cobalt Kitty was not an isolated
APT, but part of something bigger. Example of the C&C domains and IPs used by the group
across different APT campaigns and caught in the wild:
*.chatconnecting(.)com
blog.versign(.)com
vieweva(.)com
tulationeva(.)com

teriava(.)com
tonholding(.)com
nsquery(.)net
notificeva(.)com

23.227.196(.)210
104.237.218(.)72
45.114.117(.)137

Some of these domains were also mentioned in FireEye’s APT32 report, further confirming our
suspicions that the group behind the attack is the OceanLotus Group.
The group includes members who are fluent in at least two Asian languages. This claim is
supported by the language used in the spear-phishing emails, which appear to be written by
native speakers. In addition, the language localization settings found in few of the payloads
suggest that the malware authors compiled the payloads on machines with Asian languages

support. The threat actors are not likely native English speakers since multiple typos were found
in their payloads.
For example, the following typo was observed in the file metadata of one of the backdoors.
Notice the “Internal Name” field (“Geogle Update”):

Threat Actor Profile
The attackers behind Operation Cobalt Kitty were extremely persistent. Even when their
campaign was exposed, the attackers did not give up. They took “pauses” that lasted between
48 hours and four weeks and used the downtime to learn from their “mistakes” and develop
workarounds before resuming the APT campaign.
The members of the OceanLotus Group demonstrated a remarkable ability to quickly adapt,
introduce new tools and fine tune existing ones to bypass security solutions and avoid detection.
The high number of payloads and the elaborate C2 infrastructure used in this attack can be
indicative of the resources that the attackers had at their disposal. Simultaneously orchestrating
multiple APT campaigns of such magnitude and sophistication takes time, financial resources
and a large team who can support it.

Threat actor’s main characteristics
Here are the main characteristics that can help profile the threat actor:
●

Motivation - Based on the nature of the attack, the proprietary information that the
attackers were after and the high-profile personnel who were targeted, Cybereason
concluded the main motivation behind the attack was cyber espionage. The attacker
sought after specific documents and type of information. This is consistent with previous
reports about the group’s activity show that the group has a very wide range of targets,
spanning from government agencies, media, business sector, and more.

●

●

Operational working hours - Most of the malicious activity was mostly done around
normal business hours (8AM-8PM). Very little active hacking activity was detected
during weekends. The attackers showed a slight tendency to carry out hacking
operations towards the afternoon and evening time. These observations can suggest the
following:
○ Time zone(s) proximity.
○ An institutionalized threat actor (possibly nation-state)
Outlook backdoor and data exfiltration - One of the most interesting tools introduced
by the attackers was the Outlook backdoor, which used Outlook as a C2 channel. This
backdoor has not been publicly documented and is one of the most unique TTPs with
regards to the threat actor. Outlook backdoors are not a new concept and have been
observed in different APTs in the past. However, this specific type of Outlook backdoor
is can be considered as one of the “signature tools” of the OceanLotus Group.

●

Publicly available tools - The attackers showed a clear preference to use publicly
available hacking tools and frameworks. Beyond being spared the hassle of creating a
new tool, it is much harder to attribute a tool that can be used by anyone rather than a
custom-made tool. However, the attackers should not be considered script-kiddies. Most
of the publicly available tools were either obfuscated, modified and even merged with
other tools to evade antivirus detection. This type of customization requires good coding
skills and understanding of how those tools work.

●

Cobalt Strike usage in APT - Cobalt Strike is a commercial offensive security
framework designed to simulate complex attacks and is mainly used by security
professionals in security audits and penetration testing. The OceanLotus Group was
previously documented using Cobalt Strike as one of its main tools. Other Large scale
APTs using Cobalt Strike have been reported before, such as APT-TOCS (could be
related to OceanLotus), Ordinaff, Carbanak Group, and the Cobalt Group.

●

Custom-built backdoors - The threat actor used very sophisticated and stealthy
backdoors (Denis & Goopy) that were written by highly skilled malware authors. During
the attack, the authors introduced new variants of these backdoors, indicating “on-thefly” development capabilities. Developing such state-of-the-art backdoors requires skillful
malware authors, time and resources. In addition, both the Denis and Goopy backdoors
used DNS Tunneling for C2 communication. The OceanLotus Group is known to have a
backdoor dubbed SOUNDBITE by FireEye that use this stealthy technique. However, no
public analysis reports of SOUNDBITE is available to the time of writing this report.

●

Exploiting DLL hijacking in trusted applications - The attackers exploited three DLLhijacking vulnerabilities in legitimate applications from trusted vendors: Microsoft,
Google and Kaspersky. This further indicates the group’s emphasis on vulnerability
research. DLL-hijacking / Side-loading attacks are not uncommon in APTs, some of
which are also carried out by nation-state actors and advanced cyber-crime groups.

There have been reports in the past of GoogleUpdate exploited by PlugX by Chinese
threat actors as well as the Bookworm RAT exploiting Microsoft and Kaspersky
applications in APTs targeting Asia.
●

Insisting on fileless operation - While fileless delivery infrastructure is not a feature
that can be attributed to one specific group, it is still worth mentioning since the attackers
went out of their way to restore the script-based PowerShell / Visual Basic operation,
especially after PowerShell execution had been disabled in the entire organization.

●

C&C infrastructure
○

○

○

○

Divide and conquer - Each tool communicated with different sets of C&C
servers domains, which usually came in triads. For instance, Cobalt strike
payloads communicated with certain sets of IPs/domains while the backdoors
communicated with different sets of IPs/domains.
Re-use of domains and IPs across campaigns - Quite a few domains and IPs
that were observed in Operation Cobalt Kitty were found in-the-wild, attacking
other targets. It’s rather peculiar why the threat actor re-used the same domains
and IPs. It could be assumed that the malware operators wanted to have
centralized C&C servers per tool or tools, where they could monitor all of their
campaigns from dedicated servers.
Anonymous DNS records - Most of the domains point to companies that
provide DNS data privacy and anonymization, such as PrivacyProtect and
PrivacyGuardian.
C&C server protection - Most of the C&C servers IP addresses are protected
by CloudFlare and SECURED SERVERS LLC.

OceanLotus Group activity in Asia
As part of the analysis of the domains and IPs that were used in this operation, Cybereason
found samples that were caught “in-the-wild” (that were not part of Operation Cobalt Kitty).
Analysis of those samples clearly indicates the involvement of the threat actor in Asia and
Vietnam in particular. Both Qihoo 360 and FireEye demonstrate in their reports that the threat
actor is involved in campaigns in different Asian countries, such as Vietnam, China, and the
Philippines.
Most of the samples caught in-the-wild seem to target Vietnamese speakers. Some of the
samples exhibit clear evidence of targeting Vietnamese entities. This conclusion is derived from
the file names and file contents that are written in Vietnamese, as shown in the examples below:
