3. AVIVORE – Hunting Global Aerospace through the Supply Chain
The Threat Intelligence and Incident Response Team at Context Information Security has
identified a new threat group behind a series of incidents targeted at the aerospace and
defence industries in the UK and Europe.

Until now, most prominent supply chain intrusions have been "vertical"; initial victims are
typically Managed Services Providers or software vendors leveraged by attackers to move
up or down the supply chain. However, since summer 2018, Context Information Security
has been investigating a series of incidents targeting UK and European Aerospace and

Defence that are best described as "horizontal". Advanced attackers have been leveraging
direct connectivity between suppliers and partners who are integrated into each other’s
value chains. We have been tracking this activity under the codename AVIVORE.
Affected victims include large multinational firms (Primes) and smaller engineering or
consultancy firms within their supply chain (Secondaries). Context has worked closely with
victims, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), security organisations, and law
enforcement agencies across Europe to reduce impact and prevent further compromise.

Who is AVIVORE?
Context categorises AVIVORE as a previously unknown and untracked nation-state level
adversary, whose operators’ working hours appear to correlate to a time zone of UTC +8.
The primary objective for their intrusions is believed to be espionage, as well as access
enablement through supply chain partners.
Recent reporting into incidents affecting Aerospace and Defence Primes has speculated
that either APT10 or JSSD (Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security) may be responsible
for this activity. Whilst certain similarities between these adversaries' campaigns and those
investigated by Context exist, the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs),
infrastructure and tooling observed differ significantly. Whilst involvement of these named
adversaries cannot be ruled out, available evidence suggests this campaign is the work of a
separate adversary group.

Capable and Adaptable
AVIVORE showed themselves to be highly capable; adept at both “living-off-the-land”
(masquerading as legitimate users) and in their operational security awareness; including
forensically covering their tracks. They demonstrated detailed knowledge of key individuals
associated with projects of interest, and were able to successfully mirror working times and
patterns of these users to avoid arousing suspicions. They were also able to manipulate
victim environments and security controls to facilitate and obfuscate their activities (e.g.
modifying firewall rules to accept RDP over alternate ports; establishing hosts within the
victim environment as remote access proxies). AVIVORE’s attack methodology for the
linked intrusions followed a relatively set-format:
Access into victim through leverage of compromised user credentials and legitimate
external remote access services;
Escalate privileges within victim environment via abuse of legitimate tools and/or
highly privileged service and enterprise administrator accounts;
Conduct account and host enumeration using 'net' commands;
Schedule execution of scripts and tooling run in the context of the ‘SYSTEM’ user;
Remove forensic artefacts of scripts & tooling, and clearing of event logs following
execution;

Use of RDP for lateral movement around the victim environment.

Infrastructure and Tooling
AVIVORE made extensive use of infrastructure providing interconnectivity between victims;
affected Secondaries are often suppliers to multiple Primes and frequently maintain direct
network connectivity via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or other remote and collaborative
working solutions. AVIVORE exploited this relationship to bypass the (generally welldefended) perimeters of the Primes, evading critical controls and taking advantage of the
challenges many organisations face in cross-boundary coordination.
This technique, referred to as "Island Hopping", allowed AVIVORE to chain activity across
multiple business units (with local IT and security teams operating independently) or
geographical locales within victim environments. Where Context had visibility of victimfacing network infrastructure employed by AVIVORE, it primarily consisted of commercial
VPN infrastructure located in Singapore and Japan, as well as Tor. This all served to
obfuscate the origin of AVIVORE’s connections into victim networks and made investigation
challenging.
AVIVORE demonstrated a preference for in-built system tooling and abuse of legitimate
software. They introduced network scanning and certificate extractions tools, as well as
Windows SysInternals tools such as ProcDump, across multiple victim environments. These
binaries were renamed to imitate Windows DLLs and staged in file system locations
associated with compatibility and performance logging. Such tools were typically executed
on remote systems using scheduled tasks and then removed, together with their output,
following execution.
Multiple instances of the PlugX Remote Access Trojan were discovered on compromised
hosts. Evidence suggested these implants were deployed between October 2015 and
October 2016. File system artefacts indicated that attackers may have interacted with them
between deployment and the 2018 intrusions. Although direct interaction with these
implants was not observed during the investigation period, Context assess with lowmoderate confidence that they may be associated to the AVIVORE intrusions. Evidence
indicated that some of the implants were patched in-memory, with modified configuration
blocks injected post-execution to provide new C2 domains during times AVIVORE operators
were active inside victim environments.

Future Recommendations and Mitigations
Though the majority of activity investigated by Context has taken place since Jan/Feb 2018,
artefacts from some victim environments indicate that AVIVORE likely maintained persistent
access since October 2015, and potentially even earlier. Therefore, it is possible that this is

a small portion of a broader campaign. In addition to Aerospace and Defence engineering
victims, Context has seen AVIVORE target assets related to a number of other verticals
including:
Automotive
Consultancy
Energy/Nuclear
Space and Satellite Technology
Based on the information and assets sought by AVIVORE, Context assesses with moderate
confidence that the objective of the recent campaign was intellectual property theft from
victim organisations. Although defence against advanced nation-state level actors can be
challenging, Context recommend the following mitigations to disrupt future AVIVORE
activity:
Impose access limitations on supplier connections over VPNs, such as preventing
their use outside of the supplier’s business hours or from IP addresses and locations
other than those pre-agreed, and restrict access only to data and assets they require
to perform their actions.
Ensure that security measures, such as multifactor authentication and enhanced
auditing/logging are deployed to hosts and services into which suppliers are required
to connect, in order to prevent or support the investigation of any suspicious user
behaviour.
Ensure that external remote access services implement appropriate log retention.
Logs should contain enough information on the sources of inbound connections to
enable identification of anomalies, such as concurrent log-ins with impossible
geography.
Ensure that credentials for highly privileged accounts and remote services are stored
securely, and their use is appropriately monitored. Hosts such as domain controllers,
sensitive file shares and Public Key Infrastructure servers, should also be subject to
particular additional scrutiny and monitoring.
Where possible, applications, documentation and technical information related to
network infrastructure and configuration of remote access services should be made
available only to engineers, IT support staff and other individuals with legitimate
business need.
