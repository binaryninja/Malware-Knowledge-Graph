Key Findings
The Citizen Lab, in collaboration with Catalan civil society groups, has identified at
least 65 individuals targeted or infected with mercenary spyware.
At least 63 were targeted or infected with Pegasus, and four others with Candiru. At
least two were targeted or infected with both.
Victims included Members of the European Parliament, Catalan Presidents, legislators,
jurists, and members of civil society organisations. Family members were also infected
in some cases.
We identified evidence of HOMAGE, a previously-undisclosed iOS zero-click
vulnerability used by NSO Group that was effective against some versions prior to 13.2.
The Citizen Lab is not conclusively attributing the operations to a specific entity, but
strong circumstantial evidence suggests a nexus with Spanish authorities.
We shared a selection of Pegasus cases with Amnesty International’s Tech Lab, which
independently validated our forensic methodology.

Introduction
In 2019, WhatsApp patched CVE-2019-3568, a vulnerability exploited by NSO Group to hack
Android phones around the world with Pegasus. At the same time, WhatsApp notified 1,400
users who had been targeted with the exploit. Among the targets were multiple members of
civil society and political figures in Catalonia, Spain. The Citizen Lab assisted WhatsApp in
notifying civil society victims and helping them take steps to be more secure.
The cases were first reported by The Guardian in 2020. Following these reports, the Citizen
Lab, in collaboration with civil society organisations, undertook a large-scale investigation
into Pegasus hacking in Spain. The investigation has uncovered at least 65 individuals
targeted or infected with Pegasus or spyware from Candiru, another mercenary hacking
company.
Forensic evidence was obtained from victims who consented to participate in a research
study with the Citizen Lab. Further, victims publicly named in this report consented to be
identified as such, while other targets chose to remain anonymous. Confirmed cases of
Pegasus and Candiru hacking (i.e. when the spyware is successfully installed on a device)
are referred to as “infections” or being “infected” throughout the report, while “targeted” refers
to an act of targeting with Pegasus or Candiru spyware that may or may not correspond to a
forensically-discovered infection (i.e. because a device was unavailable for analysis, or is an
Android which is more difficult to forensically analyse). “Hacking” is used as a global term to
describe the act of targeting and/or infecting devices.
The hacking covers a spectrum of civil society in Catalonia, from academics and activists to
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Catalonia’s government and elected officials were
also extensively targeted, from the highest levels of Catalan government to Members of the
European Parliament, legislators, and their staff and family members. We do not conclusively
attribute the targeting to a specific government, but extensive circumstantial evidence points
to the Spanish government.

Background: Spain, Catalonia, and Surveillance
Following three years of civil war spanning from 1936 to 1939, and thirty-six years of brutal
dictatorship under General Francisco Franco, Spain’s government transitioned into a
democratic, constitutional monarchy in 1975-1978. Under the King as head of state, Spain’s
elected Prime Minister and Council of Ministers form the government. The Spanish
Parliament appoints, and dismisses, the prime minister. Pedro Sánchez, leader of the
Socialist Workers’ Party, currently serves as prime minister, a position he has held since
2018.
Spain maintains a robust security and intelligence apparatus largely as a function of the
country’s experience with terrorism and organised crime. The National Intelligence Center
(CNI) acts as both a domestic and international intelligence agency, while the Guardia Civil is
3/46

the country’s policing and law enforcement body of a “military nature.” Both are accountable
to the head of government through the Ministry of the Defense. As with most countries’
intelligence agencies, the CNI’s activities are shrouded in secrecy, and the agency lacks
public transparency. The CNI has also been at the centre of a series of surveillance and
espionage scandals. Ensuring transparency and public accountability in the operations of
Spain’s intelligence apparatus is an enduring challenge, despite the requirement of some
judicial oversight.

Background on Catalonia’s History and Government
The autonomous community of Catalonia (one of several autonomous communities in Spain)
is located in north-eastern Spain and comprises four provinces: Girona, Barcelona,
Tarragona, and Lleida. Catalonia is considered among the wealthiest regions of Spain and its
economy represents a significant portion of Spain’s Gross Domestic Product. The region’s
official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Catalonia has a long and complex history and its
desire for greater autonomy and independence has roots that date back hundreds of years.
Catalonia’s autonomous status, culture, and society were persecuted throughout Franco’s
dictatorship, until it regained autonomy following the regime’s demise in 1977-1978. Since
Catalonia’s 1979 Statute of Autonomy, efforts in favour of greater autonomy ebbed and
flowed for several decades, but grew larger and more organised leading up to the 2003
elections. The winning coalition led by Pasqual Maragall produced the 2006 Statute of
Autonomy. Maragall said the Statute would grant Catalonia unprecedented, “state-like”
autonomy.

Events Leading Up to and Following the 2017 Referendum
The campaign for a fully independent Catalonia, while divisive, gradually gained traction in
the late 1990s. The momentum then accelerated following the 2008 financial crisis. In 2009,
the municipality of Arenys de Munt held a referendum on the secession question (96% in
favour, 41% turnout). Self-determination referenda have been found to violate Article 2 of the
1978 Spanish Constitution, which entrenches the “indissoluble unity” of the nation.
Notwithstanding, Arenys inspired other Catalan municipalities to hold similar referenda. Over
the next year and a half, 58.3% of Catalan municipalities—constituting 77.5% of Catalonia’s
population—held separate referenda.
In 2010, Spain’s Constitutional Court struck down certain sections of the 2006 Statute of
Autonomy, which governs the relationship between Catalonia and Spain. This decision led to
a massive protest in Barcelona. Further, significant pro-independence protests (accompanied
by the slogan “Catalonia, a new European state”) followed in Barcelona in 2012. On the
heels of the protest, the Catalan government issued a resolution affirming “a new era based
on the right to decide.” This resolution, and others, were systematically rejected by the
Spanish Constitutional Court. In 2014, after an attempt to hold an official referendum was
ruled to be illegal by the Constitutional Court, the Catalan government held a non-binding

4/46

self-determination referendum, also referred to as the Citizen Participation Process on the
Political Future of Catalonia. The referendum led to serious consequences for the then
president of Catalonia, Artur Mas, and some other government officials.
In 2017, Carles Puigdemont—the successor to Mas—announced before the Catalan
Parliament that he would hold a binding referendum on independence. The referendum was
held on October 1, 2017, despite Spain’s Constitutional Court finding the referendum to be
illegal under Spanish law. Of those who voted, 90% supported independence, although the
final turnout was low at only 42% of voters. At the time, the Catalan government’s
spokesperson stated that the count did not include ballots seized in raids by the Spanish
police. There were also reports of police turning away voters from polling places. During the
referendum, Human Rights Watch described the Spanish police as using excessive force
when confronting peaceful demonstrators. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, called for an independent investigation into the violence, and urged
that the dispute be resolved through dialogue.
In late October 2017, the Catalan Parliament approved a resolution in favour of
independence, with 72 of the 135 members signing. The Spanish government responded by
firing Puigdemont, dissolving the Catalan Parliament, and scheduling new elections.
Regardless, pro-independence parties still won a majority in the new Parliament.
Puigdemont, meanwhile, had fled Catalonia, accompanied by several colleagues. Although
some later returned to face trial, Puigdemont remained in Brussels. He was subsequently
elected as a member of the European Parliament, and continues to fight extradition to Spain.
Reportedly, the CNI collaborated with German intelligence agencies to undertake
surveillance on Puigdemont leading to his March 25, 2018 arrest in Germany. In October
2019, the Supreme Court of Spain sentenced a number of Catalans convicted of sedition for
participating in the 2017 referendum to prison terms of nine to 13 years. Several international
human rights organisations strongly criticised the convictions and sentencing as potential
violations of international human rights law. The sentencing sparked new protests, including
calls for non-violent civil disobedience organised by a tech-savvy independence movement
called the Tsunami Democràtic. The Catalans convicted of sedition were eventually
pardoned by the Spanish government in 2021.
Spanish courts have determined that Catalan secession is contrary to Spanish domestic and
constitutional law. But the question may be more nuanced under international law and raises
legal questions related to territorial integrity, self-determination, declarations of
independence, secession, and recognition. Negotiations between Catalonia and the Spanish
government resumed in September 2021, after a hiatus of a year and a half. In February
2022, Pere Aragonès—now president of the government of Catalonia – indicated that he was
open to continuing negotiations with the Spanish government.

Documented Surveillance Abuses in Spain and Catalonia

5/46

While secrecy surrounds Spain’s surveillance practices, a number of cases have come to
light over the last several decades that are relevant to this report and demonstrate a track
record of domestic surveillance and the use of spyware by Spanish authorities. In 2001,
Mariano Rajoy, then Spain’s Minister of Interior, purchased the Sistema integral de
interpretación de las comunicaciones (SITEL), spyware the Guardia Civil and CNI used to
track suspects’ phones. Spain also reportedly ‘colluded’ with the National Security Agency
(NSA) in the United States. One interpretation of the 2013 Snowden disclosures suggested
that the NSA had intercepted 60 million calls in Spain between December 2012 and January
2013. However, a subsequent analysis showed that these assertions were based on a likely
misinterpretation of slides from the Snowden disclosures, and actually related to data
collection by NATO allies, including Spain, in Afghanistan.1
According to el Confidencial, the CNI and National Police paid at least 209,000 euros to the
Milan-based surveillance software company Hacking Team for use of its spyware in 2010.
The purchase was first revealed in 2015 when WikiLeaks published internal Hacking Team
emails. El País then reported that the contract with the CNI was “valid from 2010 to 2016,
worth 3.4 million euros.” The CNI acknowledged it purchased the spyware at the time, saying
it did so “in accordance with the public sector contracting laws.” CNI declined to give any
further information as to what they did with Hacking Team’s spyware. In 2015, the Citizen
Lab mapped the proliferation of Finfisher, a sophisticated computer spyware suite sold
exclusively to governments for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, and identified a
suspected Spanish customer.
The latest targeted espionage scandal in Spain arose publicly in 2020 when several
prominent Catalans announced that WhatsApp and the Citizen Lab had notified them that
they were targeted in the 2019 WhatsApp Pegasus breach. The first to do so was Roger
Torrent, then pro-independence president of the Catalan Parliament. The targeting of Torrent
with NSO Group’s spyware was confirmed by WhatsApp. Ernest Maragall, leader of the proindependence, Barcelona-based Republican Left of Catalonia party, was the second target to
come forward, followed by Anna Gabriel, a former regional member of Parliament for the farleft party, the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), activist Jordi Domingo, and Puigdemont
staffer Sergi Miquel Gutiérrez. Gabriel was targeted while she was living in Switzerland. The
Spanish prime minister’s office claimed that it was “not aware” of this spying. Nonetheless, in
2020, El País confirmed that the Spanish government was an NSO Group customer, and that
the CNI actively used Pegasus spyware. A former NSO employee commented to
Motherboard that they “‘were actually very proud of them as a customer’ … ‘Finally, a
European state.’”

Finding: Catalans Targeted with Pegasus
With the targets’ consent, we obtained forensic artefacts from their devices that we examined
for evidence of Pegasus infections. Our forensic analysis enables us to conclude with high
confidence that, of the 63 people targeted with Pegasus, at least 51 individuals were
6/46

infected.
Click here for a graphical overview of our findings.
Almost all of the incidents occurred between 2017 and 2020, although we found an instance
of targeting in 2015. All targets publicly named in this report consented to be identified as
such.
In addition to the forensic confirmations, we identified additional cases of Catalans targeted
by Pegasus infection attempts, but where we were unable to forensically validate an
infection. This was due to multiple reasons, ranging from changed or discarded devices, to
the limitations of our forensic tooling.

Table 1: Pegasus Infection and Targeting Overview
Spain has a high Android prevalence over iOS (~80% Android in 2021). Anecdotally, this is
somewhat reflected in the individuals we contacted. Because our forensic tools for detecting
Pegasus are much more developed for iOS devices, we believe that this report heavily
undercounts the number of individuals likely targeted and infected with Pegasus because
they had Android devices.

Relational or “Off-Centre” Targeting
Targeting friends, family members, and close associates is a common practice for some
hacking operations. This technique allows an attacker to gather information about a primary
target without necessarily maintaining access to that person’s device. In some cases, the
primary target may also be infected, but in others this may not be feasible for various
reasons.
We observed several cases of relational or “off-centre” targeting: spouses, siblings, parents,
staff, or close associates of primary targets were targeted and infected with Pegasus. In
some cases those individuals may also have been targeted, but forensic information was
unavailable. In others, we found no evidence that a primary target was infected with
Pegasus, but found targeting of their intimates.

7/46

For example, one individual targeted with Candiru had a US SIM card in their device, and
resided in the US. We failed to find evidence that this individual was infected with Pegasus.
This is consistent with reports that most Pegasus customers are not permitted to target US
numbers. However, both of the target’s parents use phones with Spanish numbers, and were
targeted on the day that the primary target flew back to Spain from the US. Neither parent is
politically active or likely to have been targeted because of who they are or what they do.

Target: Members of the European Parliament
Every Catalan Member of the European Parliament (MEP) that supported independence was
targeted either directly with Pegasus, or via suspected relational targeting. Three MEPs were
directly infected, two more had staff, family members, or close associates targeted with
Pegasus.
Diana Riba (MEP, ERC), who assumed office in July 2019 was infected on or around
October 28, 2019. Antoni Comín (MEP, JUNTS), who also assumed office in July 2019, was
infected sometime between August 2019 and January 2020. He had assumed his role as a
MEP in July 2019. Antoni Comín is also Vice President of the Council of the Catalan
Republic.
In some cases, the targeting coincided with political events, underlining that the targeting
may have been for the purposes of political espionage. For example, Jordi Solé (MEP, ERC)
was targeted during party discussions about who would replace MEP Oriol Junqueras. One
instance took the form of a fake SMS from Spain’s social security system. Forensic evidence
confirms that he was infected at least twice on or around June 11 and June 27, 2020, shortly
before being substituted into his role as a MEP in July 2020.
These dates and findings do not preclude the possibility of other infections or targeting. As
with other victim clusters, we were not always able to fully forensically examine all relevant
devices.

example, Marcela Topor, his spouse, was infected at least twice (on or around October 7,
2019 and July 4, 2020).

Target: Catalan Civil Society
Multiple Catalan civil society organisations that support Catalan political independence
targeted with Pegasus, including Òmnium Cultural and Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC).
Catalans working in the open-source and digital voting communities were also targeted. This
section highlights a selection of the cases.
Target: Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC)
At ANC, five board members were targeted, including university professor Jordi Sànchez
(President, 2015 – 2017). Interestingly, Sànchez was first seen targeted with a Pegasus
SMS infection attempt via SMS 2015, shortly after a large demonstration in Barcelona. This
is the earliest Pegasus infection attempt that we have observed as bulk of the targeting
uncovered by this investigation appears to have occurred between 2017 and 2020.

Between 2017 and 2020, Sànchez received at least 25 more Pegasus SMSes, most of which
masqueraded as news updates relating to Catalan and Spanish politics. He also received
messages purporting to come from the Spanish tax and social security authorities.
Messages received by Sànchez often coincided with important political events. For example,
on April 20, 2017, he was targeted the day prior to Catalan government meetings with civil
society groups to discuss the October referendum. Months later, just as polling stations
opened on October 1, 2017, he was targeted with an alarming message saying that a police
“offensive” was beginning. Forensic analysis confirms that Sànchez was infected at least four
times with Pegasus between May and October 2017.
Sanchez is among the prominent Catalans arrested, and later pardoned, for their role in the
Referendum. One of the infections occurred on October 13, 2017, just days before his arrest.
Interestingly, the SMSes targeting his phone in 2020 coincided with days when he was given
weekend release from jail.
Professor Elisenda Paluzie (ANC President, 2018 – 2022) is a prominent Catalan
economist, academic, and activist. Prior to her role with the ANC, she served as dean of the
Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Barcelona.
She was working from home during the COVID lockdown when the first Pegasus infection
attempt arrived. It purported to be a news story about the ANC. On June 10, 2020, as she
was running for a board seat with ANC and as online voting began, a second infection
attempt arrived. It masqueraded as a Twitter update from a Catalan newspaper.
Another ANC board member, Sònia Urpí Garcia, was infected with Pegasus on June 22,
2020, just over a week after being elected to the role on June 13, 2020.
Target: Òmnium Cultural
Multiple individuals around Òmnium were similarly targeted with Pegaus. These included the
journalist Meritxell Bonet, who is the spouse of Òmnium’s former president Jordi Cuixart.
Bonet was targeted while Cuixart was facing charges for his role in the 2017 referendum,
and infected on June 4, 2019, not long before he was to make his final statements at trial. He
was later sentenced in October 2019, and pardoned in 2021.
Journalist and historian Marcel Mauri became vice president of Òmnium after Cuixart was
sentenced on October 14, 2019. Within ten days of assuming the role, on October 24, 2019,
we found evidence of what would be the first of three Pegasus infections of his phone. We
also found evidence of extensive Pegasus SMS targeting straddling that period, beginning in
February 2018 and ending in May 2020.
Elena Jiménez, another executive board member and the international representative of
Òmnium, was also infected with Pegasus. Although we are unable to determine the date of
the infection, the case is interesting: her role included dialogue with NGOs throughout
10/46

Europe including Amnesty International and Frontline Defenders. The compromise of her
communications would have likely provided a unique view into Catalan advocacy efforts.
Jordi Bosch, also an executive board member, was infected with Pegasus on or around July
11, 2020.
Catalan’s Open-Source and Digital Voting Community
Joan Matamala runs a bookstore and foundation promoting the Catalan language and
culture, originally founded by his father in defiance of Franco’s dictatorship. Matamala also
recently founded the Nord Foundation which promotes open-source citizen participation
software. Forensic examination of his phone indicates that he was also infected at least 16
times with Pegasus between August 2019 and July 2020.
Matamala was also infected with Candiru spyware. Other members of the Catalan opensource community who work on voting software and decentralization were similarly targeted
with Candiru. Their cases are described below in greater detail (See Finding: Catalans
Targeted with Candiru).

Lawyers Representing Prominent Catalans
Multiple lawyers representing prominent Catalans were targeted and infected with Pegasus,
some extensively. While not all have consented to be named, the targeting suggests that this
group was a specific focus for monitoring.
For example, well-known lawyer Gonzalo Boye, who represents Puigdemont (among
others), was targeted at least 18 times with infection attempts between January and May
2020. Some of the messages masqueraded as tweets from organisations like Human Rights
Watch, The Guardian, Columbia Journalism Review, and Politico.
Boye was successfully infected with Pegasus on or around October 30, 2020. The timing is
interesting: one of his clients had been arrested just 48 hours before the infection.
Andreu Van den Eynde, lawyer for prominent Catalans Oriol Junqueras, Roger Torrent,
Raül Romeva, and Ernest Maragall, was infected on June 14, 2020. Jaume AlonsoCuevillas, a lawyer who also represented Puigdemont, was infected with Pegasus, although
we were unable to determine the date of the infection. Alonso-Cuevillas is currently a
member of the Parliament of Catalonia, former dean of the Barcelona Bar Association, and
former President of the European Bar Federation.

Target: Catalan Government, Parliament, and Politicians
Catalan politicians were extensively infected with Pegasus. The targeting took place
throughout sensitive negotiations between the Catalan and Spanish governments. This
section lists a selection of the cases.

Figure 4:
Targets Among Catalan Political Parties
Taken together, the targeting indicates an extremely well-informed and widespread effort to
monitor Catalan political processes. Examination of the SMS targeting also points to a
detailed understanding of the targets, their interests, concerns, and activities. The timing of
the targeting often directly coincided with specific non-public and sensitive activities such as
strategy meetings and negotiations. This is highly suggestive of a well resourced intelligence
service.

Exploit Techniques
Victims were infected through at least two vectors: zero-click exploits and malicious SMSes.
While users can be trained to be vigilant about not clicking suspicious links, the use of zeroclick exploits is especially difficult to defend against as there is no action that a regular user
can take that will reliably protect them against this kind of attack.

Zero-Click Exploits
We saw evidence that multiple zero-click iMessage exploits were used to hack Catalan
targets’ iPhones with Pegasus between 2017 and 2020.
Discovering Homage

13/46

We have identified signs of a zero-click exploit that has not been previously described, which
we call HOMAGE. The HOMAGE exploit appears to have been in use during the last months
of 2019, and involved an iMessage zero-click component that launched a WebKit instance in
the com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd process, following a
com.apple.private.alloy.photostream lookup for a Pegasus email address. The WebKit
instance in the com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd process fetched JavaScript scaffolding
that we recovered from an infected phone. The scaffolding was fetched from
/[uniqueid]/stadium/goblin. After performing tests, the scaffolding then fetches the WebKit
exploit from /[uniqueid]/stadium/eutopia if tests succeed.

Figure 5: The scaffolding sets up code to fetch the WebKit exploit.
One test run by the scaffolding checks the exact screen resolution in pixels, and compares it
with hardcoded values for each type of iPhone hardware, with or without display zoom
enabled. If there are multiple possible matches (for example, the iPhone X and Xs share the
same screen resolution if the latter is running in “display zoom” mode), then a timing sidechannel is tested, which involves measuring the time taken to encrypt a buffer of 2^28 bytes
using AES in CBC mode. If the measured time is less than 560ms, then the test concludes
that the iPhone device uses PAC (iPhone Xs and above). If the time taken is greater than
560ms, then the test concludes that the device does not use PAC (iPhone X and earlier).
The exploit was fired at the phone on at least the following dates:
Mon, 16 Dec 2019 16:05:01 GMT
Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:45:03 GMT
Thu, 19 Dec 2019 11:38:45 GMT
Thu, 26 Dec 2019 08:32:51 GMT
Sun, 29 Dec 2019 10:58:04 GMT
Thu, 02 Jan 2020 13:32:49 GMT
Sat, 04 Jan 2020 10:47:05 GMT
Wed, 08 Jan 2020 07:27:46 GMT
Among Catalan targets, we did not see any instances of the HOMAGE exploit used against a
device running a version of iOS greater than 13.1.3. It is possible that the exploit was fixed in
iOS 13.2. We are not aware of any zero-day, zero-click exploits deployed against Catalan
targets following iOS 13.1.3 and before iOS 13.5.1.
The Citizen Lab has reported the exploit to Apple and provided them with relevant forensic
artifacts. At this time, we do not have evidence to suggest that Apple device users on up-todate versions of iOS are at risk.
14/46

Kismet
The zero-clicks used also included the KISMET exploit, which was a zero-day in the summer
of 2020 against iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7. Though the exploit was never captured and
documented, it was apparently fixed by changes introduced into iOS14, including the
BlastDoor framework.
The most recent case we have documented of an iPhone belonging to a Catalan target that
was infected with Pegasus was in December 2020, via the KISMET exploit.
The 2019 WhatsApp Attack
Citizen Lab has previously confirmed that multiple Catalans were among those targeted with
Pegasus through the 2019 WhatsApp attack, which relied on the (now patched) CVE-20193568 vulnerability.

SMS-Based Targeting
Many victims were targeted using SMS based attacks, and we have collected more than 200
such messages. These attacks involved operators sending text messages containing
malicious links designed to trick targets into clicking. In this approach, once a victim clicks on
a link, the device is infected via a Pegasus exploit server.
Sophistication and personalization of the messages varied across attempts, but they reflect
an often detailed understanding of the target’s habits, interests, activities, and concerns. In
many cases, either the timing or the contents of the text were highly customised to the
targets and indicated the likely use of other forms of surveillance.
Jordi Baylina is the technology lead at Polygon, a popular decentralised Ethereum scaling
platform. He is also an advisor on projects related to digital voting and decentralisation, and
has built a widely-used privacy toolkit. He was extensively targeted with Pegasus, receiving
at least 26 infection attempts. Ultimately, he was infected at least eight times between
October 2019 and July 2020.
Baylina received a text message masquerading as a boarding pass link for a Swiss
International Air Lines flight he had purchased. Targeting in this case indicates that the
Pegasus operator may have had access to Baylina’s Passenger Name Record (PNR) or
other information collected from the carrier.
Fake Mobile Boarding Pass

15/46

Another common mode of targeting was to masquerade as official notifications from Spanish
government entities, including the Tax and Social Security authorities.The messages also
used SMS Sender IDs to masquerade as official agency accounts.
Notably, fake official messages were sometimes highly personalized. For example, a
message sent to Jordi Baylina included a portion of his actual official tax identification
number, suggesting that the Pegasus operator had access to this information.
Fake Official Notifications

16/46

We also observed regular use of package tracking or delivery notifications. Some were
personalised, containing the targets’ names.
Fake Package Notification

Many messages masqueraded as Twitter or news updates, typically focused on topics of
interest to the target. News organizations impersonated included international outlets such
as The Guardian, Financial Times, and Die Welt, English language media like the Columbia
Journalism Review, as well as regional media like La Vanguardia, Europa Press, El Temps,
El Confidencial, and so on.

Cross-Border SMS Targeting
Catalans were also targeted outside of Catalonia with Pegasus infection attempts, including
SMS messages sent to numbers with non-Spanish country codes. For example, Marta
Rovira was targeted while in Switzerland on her Swiss telephone number. Both SMS
messages used an SMS Sender ID impersonating Swiss entities: Swisspeace is an NGO,
and the Geneva Center for Security Policy is a foundation established and primarily funded
by the Swiss government.

Jordi Baylina was also targeted with infection attempts masquerading as a tweet from
European NGO European Digital Rights and a tweet purporting to be the Swiss telecom
provider Swisscom.2

19/46

The text messages pointed to a cluster of domains pointing to infrastructure previously
identified through the Citizen Lab’s Internet scanning and fingerprinting as belonging to NSO
Group’s Pegasus infection infrastructure.

Finding: Catalans Targeted with Candiru
In July 2021, we published “Hooking Candiru,” in which we identified and analysed Candiru’s
mercenary spyware, in cooperation with Microsoft. At the time we did not name the “patient
zero” for our analysis. He is Joan Matamala. As noted above, Matamala was extensively
targeted and infected with Pegasus.
While conducting a preliminary investigation into Candiru spyware we identified evidence of
a live Candiru infection on an institutional network backbone used by a consortium of
Catalan universities.
With the help of technicians from the relevant institutions, the infection was localized to a
campus of the University of Girona. Further investigation confirmed that Matamala was the
owner of the infected device, and that an infection was live.
Using a pretext, Matamala’s colleagues asked him to step away from the computer and into
the hallway. Once the situation had been explained, he consented to a forensic analysis of
the device.
We were able to successfully forensically extract the malicious spyware and determine that it
was persistently installed on his device.
With Matamala’s consent, we shared forensic traces of the spyware with Microsoft’s Threat
Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who discovered over 100 victims across ten countries.
Microsoft describes the victims of Candiru (which they refer to as SOURGUM) as including
“politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and political
dissidents.”
Microsoft also discovered two zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31979, CVE-2021-33771)
employed by Candiru to infect Windows systems, and patched them in July 2021.

Identifying Additional Candiru Targets
Forensic evidence pertaining to Candiru was obtained from victims who consented to
participate in a research study with the Citizen Lab. Victims publicly named in the report
consented to being identified as such.

Table 3: Case Overview for Pegasus Infections & Targeting
Our continuing investigation into Candiru in connection with Catalonia revealed at least three
other individuals were targeted with Candiru spyware via email messages: Elies Campo,3
Xavier Vives, and Pau Escrich. Escrich was also targeted with a Pegasus infection attempt
on June 2, 2020. Escrich and Vives are co-founders of Vocdoni, a censorship-resistant
secure digital voting protocol that Òmnium used during its internal elections. Elies Campo,
along with Jordi Baylina, both served as advisors to Vocdoni.

Candiru Email Targeting
We identified a total of seven emails containing the Candiru spyware, via links to the domain
name stat[.]email.
The email messages were well constructed efforts to entice the targets to click on the links.
For example, two of the three targets (Xavier Vives and Pau Escrich) received an email in
Figure 6 in early February 2020, featuring the official emblem of the Government of Spain,
and reporting that the World Health Organization had declared COVID-19 to be a “Public
Health Emergency of International Importance” in January.
The email contained a link to recommendations for what to do in cases of infection with
COVID-19. Clicking on the link would have infected the targets’ computers with Candiru’s
spyware.

21/46

Figure 6: Fake “Coronavirus” email sent to two of the targets in February 2020. Clicking on
the link would have infected the targets’ computer with Candiru spyware.
One of the targets, Pau Escrich, received an email impersonating the Mobile World Congress
(MWC), with a link to tickets. Had he clicked on the link, his computer would have been
infected with Candiru’s spyware. The email content appears to be copied from a legitimate
Mobile World Congress email sent to news105@tutanota[.]com, which may be an email
address used by the spyware operators.
Interestingly, Elies Campo was targeted with a well-crafted message purporting to be from
Barcelona’s Mercantile Registry (Figure 7). The message contained factual information about
a company that he administered and purported to be a warning that a similarly-named
company was registered in Panama. Such a message indicates a high degree of awareness
of Campo’s activities, and would be likely to generate a click. The message was received
while Campo was in the US.

the infection of the device with Candiru spyware.

23/46

Figure 8: Candiru infection attempt masquerading as a “Mobile World Congress” email.
The Mobile World Congress email containing a Candiru link is also noteworthy, as it echoes
bait content in a Pegasus SMS sent to a separate target, Jordi Baylina:

24/46

This content similarity hints at a potential overlap of knowledge and targeting themes
between the Candiru and Pegasus operators.

Candiru’s Capabilities
Our analysis of Candiru’s spyware showed that Candiru was designed for extensive access
to the victim device, such as extracting files and browser content, but also stealing messages
saved in the encrypted Signal Messenger Desktop app. Figure 9 shows an excerpt of
Windows spyware functionality described in a leaked Candiru contract.

25/46

Figure 9: Some of Candiru’s functionality on Windows, as described by a leaked contract.
Microsoft’s analysis established that Candiru’s spyware, which they call Devil’s Tongue, also
had functionality allowing the operator to directly use a victim’s cloud accounts on their
infected device to send or post messages using their accounts. While it can be used as part
of infection targeting, the same functionality could be used to plant evidence that would
frame an individual in a way that would be exceedingly difficult for the victim to refute.

Attribution to NSO’s Pegasus
The Citizen Lab regularly conducts large-scale scanning, fingerprinting, and monitoring for
evidence of Pegasus infections. We observed the following Pegasus domain names used in
SMS infection attempts sent to Catalan targets:
Version of Pegasus Infrastructure

Domains

Version 1

nnews[.]co

Version 3

statsads[.]co
adsmetrics[.]co

Version 4

redirstats[.]com
statsupplier[.]com infoquiz[.]net

Version 4.5

123tramites[.]com

Table 4: CatalanGate Pegasus Infrastructure Domains & Versions
26/46

Of these domains, only nnews[.]co and 123tramites[.]com were complete matches
for our fingerprint, and statsads[.]co was a partial fingerprint match. Some of the
domains appear to have customised behaviour or setup, perhaps in order to make them less
visible to our Internet scanning. For example, our Athena method for determining which
domain names were operated by a single customer (applicable to Version 3 domains) did not
work on statsads[.]co or adsmetrics[.]co . Additionally, our Version 3 fingerprint was
only a partial match for statsads[.]co (the discrepancy was that the server exhibited
300ms of additional latency, perhaps because the operator fronted their NSO Group-supplied
infrastructure with their own custom server). Our Version 3 fingerprint did not match
adsmetrics[.]co at all, perhaps again because of a separate custom server that the
operator used to front their NSO-supplied infrastructure. We also did not detect any of the
Version 4 domains, as they used SSL certificates issued by cPanel; we only scanned for SSL
certificates from specific issuers, of which cPanel was not one.
Despite the apparent customizations, we have developed evidence that all of the domains
are linked to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.

Table 5: CatalanGate Domains, Attribution to Pegasus

Most Domains Appear to be Operated by a Single Customer

27/46

We link each domain (except nnews[.]co) to a single Pegasus customer. We link the domain
names infoquiz[.]net, statsupplier[.]com and redirstats[.]com to a single customer, because
they shared setup characteristics (nameserver hosted on kualo.net and SSL certificate from
cPanel). We further believe that 123tramites[.]com was operated by the same customer,
because an SMS with a link to 123tramites[.]com used identical bait content to an SMS with
a link to statsupplier[.]com.
We further believe that adsmetrics[.]co represents the same customer, as we saw similar bait
content (message from “twitter” posing as tweet from “@ScotNational”) in an SMS with a link
to statsupplier[.]com. We further believe that statsads[.]co represents the same customer, as
we saw similar bait content (message from “twitter” posing as tweet from “@elconfidencial”)
in an SMS with a link to statsupplier[.]com. We are unsure if nnews[.]co represents the same
customer, although we suspect that even if the customer is separate, it is at least a related
customer: we did locate one individual who received Pegasus links from: nnews[.]co,
statsads[.]co and statsupplier[.]com.

Attribution to Candiru
In our July 2021 Hooking Candiru report, we listed 764 domain names that we linked to
Candiru. Our initial ground truth was a self-signed TLS certificate mentioning an email
address on the domain name candirusecurity[.]com, which is registered to Candiru.
Three of the domain names in our list of 764, adtrack[.]link, cortana[.]cloud, and rbtlnk[.]net
were interesting, because they initially matched our Candiru fingerprint CF1, but around April
2018, began to exhibit an unusual behaviour that we believe represents customization
employed by the Candiru customer using these domain names. Starting from around May
2018, any HTTPS traffic on port 443 to these three domain names was routed to a Tor client
running on the server (identifiable by the distinctive TLS certificates it returned), but only if
the SNI was set to adtrack[.]link, cortana[.]cloud, rbtlnk[.]net, or any other domain name
configured on the server. The Tor behaviour simply appeared to be a “decoy” behaviour
designed to confuse or mislead researchers who happened upon these domain names or
their IP address. The spyware did not appear to use Tor for data exfiltration, nor was the IP,
185.181.8[.]155, used as a relay by legitimate Tor users. Because this “Tor behaviour” was
different from the behaviour of other customers’ Candiru servers around this time, we
hypothesised that the Candiru customer in question was attempting to “customise” their
servers, perhaps in order to make them less visible to our Internet scanning. We scanned the
Internet for other IPs exhibiting this same “Tor behaviour,” and found only one,
185.193.38[.]113, which was pointed to by a single domain name at the time, stat[.]email.
We attributed stat[.]email not only to Candiru, but also to the same Candiru customer that
was using the other “Tor behaviour” domain names. Indeed, we located a Catalan target
(Matamala) whose computer was communicating with domain names pointing to

28/46

185.181.8[.]155, and recovered a sample of Candiru’s spyware from his computer.
Additionally, all of the Candiru emails sent to Catalan targets used the domain stat[.]email.

Attribution to a Government
At this time the Citizen Lab is not conclusively attributing these hacking operations to a
particular government, however a range of circumstantial evidence points to a strong nexus
with one or more entities within Spanish government, including:
The targets were of obvious interest to the Spanish government;
The specific timing of the targeting matches events of specific interest to the Spanish
government;
The use of bait content in SMSes suggests access to targets personal information,
such as Spanish governmental ID numbers; and,
Spain’s CNI has reportedly been an NSO Group Customer, and Spain’s Ministry of
Interior reportedly possesses an unnamed but similar capability.
We also judge it unlikely that a non-Spanish Pegasus customer would undertake such
extensive targeting within Spain, using SMSes, and often impersonating Spanish authorities.
Such a multi-year clandestine operation, especially against high profile individuals, has a
high risk of official discovery, and would surely lead to serious diplomatic and legal
repercussions for a non-Spanish government entity.

Independent Validation
A selection of four Pegasus victims provided forensic artefacts from their devices to technical
experts with Amnesty International’s Security Lab, which independently examined them for
evidence of Pegasus infections and targeting.
Elisenda Paluzie and Sònia Urpí Garcia of ANC
Journalist Meritxell Bonet
Politician & professor Jordi Sànchez
In each case, Amnesty’s Security Lab independently confirmed our findings that these
individuals were infected, using their own forensic methodology. This independently validates
the soundness of the forensic methods that the Citizen Lab used in this report to identify
Pegasus infections and targeting.

Conclusion
This report details extensive surveillance directed against Catalan civil society and
government using mercenary spyware. According to NSO Group, Pegasus is sold
exclusively to governments, and finding such an operation inevitably implicates a
government. While we do not currently attribute this operation to specific governmental
29/46

entities, circumstantial evidence suggests a strong nexus with the government of Spain,
including the nature of the victims and targets, the timing, and the fact that Spain is reported
to be a government client of NSO Group.

Call for an Investigation
The seriousness of the case clearly warrants an official inquiry to determine the responsible
party, how the hacking was authorised, what legal framework governed the hacking and what
judicial oversight applied, the true scale of the operation, the uses to which the hacked
material was put, and how hacked data was handled, including to whom it may have been
provided.

Window into a More Extensive Operation?
The list of confirmed victims and targets is striking. Our research has uncovered at least 65
Catalans whose devices were either infected or targeted with spyware. The investigation was
labor-intensive, and there are many individuals who have not had their devices checked.
Furthermore, our methods have limited insight into Android infections, which represent a
large proportion of users in the region. Thus, we suspect that the total number of victims and
targets is much higher.
This extraordinarily high number of confirmed mercenary spyware victims and targets in a
single case is by far the largest in all of the Citizen Lab’s prior research, including our reports
on Al Jazeera (36 victims) and El Salvador (35 victims).
Our investigation gives a window into what is likely a larger effort to place a significant slice
of Catalan civil society under targeted surveillance for several years. This effort has resulted
in the total surveillance of Catalan politicians in certain categories, such as multiple members
of the European Parliament and every Catalan president since 2010.

Unrestrained, Unnecessary, and Disproportionate?
The case is notable because of the unrestrained nature of the hacking activities. The list
includes numerous elected officials of Catalonia’s government, as was every Catalan
member of the European Parliament that supported independence. Staff members and
friends are also among the list. So, too, were numerous members of Catalan civil society, as
well as lawyers representing Catalans (raising questions of attorney-client privilege
violations).
Egregiously, family members of apparent targets were also targeted and infected. For
example, two physicians who use their devices to handle confidential and sensitive patient
information were likely infected because they are the parents of the true target. Indeed, the
prominent physician Dr. Elias Campo (the father of Elies Campo) was infected on his official
hospital-issued device.

30/46

The hacking also extended beyond Spain into other EU countries, including Belgium and
Germany, suggesting possible breaches of appropriate conduct for lawful cross-border
investigations, or violations of local law. Targeting was also observed in Switzerland, which
notably included impersonating Swiss organisations, including a government-supported
foundation, raising further questions about the disregard for Swiss law.
This very wide target list raises questions about whether the principles of necessity and
proportionality have been fulfilled. Many of the victims were not charged with serious
crimes, and most were neither criminals and certainly not terrorists—the typical justifications
mercenary surveillance companies employ for sales of their spyware to government clients.
It is also concerning that this surveillance occurred as the Spanish government and Catalan
officials were undertaking negotiations around political autonomy. If Spanish authorities are
responsible, clandestinely eavesdropping on the opposite side of a negotiation, including in
some cases their legal representatives or relatives, is a clear act of bad faith.

Hacking in the EU: Lack of Rules and Judicial Oversight?
If the Spanish government is responsible for this case, it raises urgent questions about
whether there is proper oversight over the country’s intelligence and security agencies, as
well as whether there is a robust legal framework that authorities are required to follow in
undertaking any hacking activities. Formally, the operations of Spain’s security agencies are
overseen by the judiciary and the relevant minister. However, it is hard to conceive how a
properly functioning oversight mechanism would permit extensive and, in some cases,
reckless hacking of numerous elected officials at such a sensitive time. It is also unclear what
safeguards were in place, if any, to ensure the protection of any hacked data, and how it was
handled.
The hacking of the devices of relatives of principal targets, such as innocent spouses and
parents, is especially disturbing. Such extensive clandestine hacking by a state against these
types of targets is almost certainly outside of the scope of what would be permissible under
international human rights law.
While Europe has recently made great strides around privacy and data protection, such as
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the picture is less bright around the
independent oversight of intelligence agencies, which remain largely cloaked in secrecy and
may be exempt from rules around privacy applied to other entities. The possibility that an EU
member state is responsible for a massive domestic surveillance operation with political
overtones should serve as a wake-up call for a collective inquiry into the need for effective
oversight.
Finally, the case is also notable because Spain is a democracy, and this case adds to the
growing number of other democracies we have discovered that have abused mercenary
spyware, including Poland, India, Israel, and El Salvador. While it is true and widely

31/46

acknowledged now that spyware and commercial surveillance technologies embolden
authoritarian regimes and are contributing to the spread of authoritarian practices worldwide,
this case is a good reminder that all countries are prone to abusing spyware when
safeguards and oversight are absent—even democratic ones, like Spain.

Hacking: A Risky Tool for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions
The objective behind the hacking we uncovered is unknown at this time. However, the
potential application of Pegasus or Candiru spyware to extract information to use in the
context of criminal investigations and prosecutions is risky because it may facilitate the use
of tainted or planted evidence by state authorities. These risks are particularly prevalent in
countries where government hacking is not subject to a rigorous legal framework and
effective judicial oversight, and there are few or no requirements for ensuring the integrity of
information collected.
Spyware such as Pegasus modifies the operating system and files on an infected device. It
is common guidance that once a device has been remotely penetrated and infected, the
integrity of data on the device may be tainted and could certainly be challenged in court.
Furthermore, we observed that Candiru spyware has the capability to send messages under
the identity of the victim, from their device. Forensically determining that the victim did not
send the messages would be extremely difficult. Such a powerful capability could easily be
misused to plant evidence. For example, in a recent case in India where incriminating
evidence was allegedly planted by hackers on an activist’s device who was then charged
with terrorism.

Another Indictment of the Mercenary Spyware Industry
This remarkable combination of high volume and unrestrained abuses points to a serious
absence of regulatory constraints, both over sales by the mercenary companies involved and
the use of such powerful surveillance tools by the government client or clients. It is now well
established that NSO Group, Candiru, other companies like them, as well as their various
ownership groups, have utterly failed to put in place even the most basic safeguards against
abuse of their spyware. What we find in Spain is yet another indictment of this industry.
