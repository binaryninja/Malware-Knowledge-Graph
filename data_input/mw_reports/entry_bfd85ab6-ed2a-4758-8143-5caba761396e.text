SolarWinds Attacks: Stealthy Attackers Attempted To
Evade Detection

Threat Hunter TeamSymantec

In the first of a series of follow-up analysis on the SolarWinds
attacks, we take a look at how the attackers disabled security
software and avoided detection
As we continue our analysis on the tools used in the SolarWinds attacks, one of the most
striking aspects we’ve noticed is how careful the attackers were to avoid drawing attention to
themselves. Software supply chain attacks are relatively stealthy to begin with, since signed
software from a trusted source is less likely to raise red flags. However, the attackers weren’t
content to rely on the cover this provided and also took several other steps to avoid
detection.

1/15

To begin with, the Sunburst backdoor (Backdoor.Sunburst), which was delivered using a
Trojanized update to SolarWinds Orion, sets a delay time of up to 14 days before execution.
In other words, no malicious activity will begin until this period has elapsed.
The length of time selected is most likely to increase the likelihood that the log entries of the
initial malicious activity have been deleted before any subsequent post-breach activity is
initiated, thereby making it difficult to correlate the two sets of malicious events. Many
organizations, including even managed security services providers (MSSPs), will often purge
their security logs after seven days to minimize storage costs and make searching them
easier.
Sunburst will also check the current Windows domain the machine belongs to. If the domain
contains the string 'test' or one of 13 additional specific domains that appear related to lab
systems such as “swdev.local” and “apac.lab”, the threat will cease to execute. A full list is in
Appendix A.

Avoiding Security Software and Researchers
Attacks begin with a Trojanized version of SolarWinds’ Orion software. The attackers
modified Orion in order to deliver the Sunburst backdoor to the computer. Sunburst is first
stage malware, designed to perform reconnaissance on the infected computer, perform
checks for security tools, and deliver a second stage payload, if required.
The main Sunburst code is contained in a class named
SolarWindows.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer that, when first instantiated, calls a member
function called Update. The function name is a ruse, as the code does not perform any
update, but instead is designed to disable security software, avoid security researcher
systems, and possibly avoid running on systems not of interest to the attackers. The function
contains three lists – a list of process names, a list of driver filenames, and a list of
processes and service name pairs. These names are all obfuscated in the code by hashing
them using the FNV1A algorithm and using variable names that masquerade as timestamps.
The function will:
Get a list of running processes.
Check if the process names match items on the process list
Get a list of all installed drivers
Check if the driver names match items on the drivers list
If a match is found, the malicious code does not perform further actions and returns
This process and driver list contains tools that commonly run on security researcher systems
and thus, this functionality appears to be designed not to run on such systems in order to
avoid discovery. The full list of security tools can be found in Appendix A. Furthermore, the
lists also contained names related to a variety of security software programs including:

Altiris Symantec - atrsdfw.sys (Ghost Pre-installation boot environment driver)

Absolute - psepfilter.sys, cve.sys
Bromium - brfilter.sys, brcow_x_x_x_x.sys
LogRhythm - lragentmf.sys
OESIS OPSwat - libwamf.sys
The security vendors on this list have most likely been chosen as the attacker has
determined that their products are unlikely be installed at organizations of interest to the
attackers. Given the indiscriminate nature of supply chain as a vector, with an estimated
18,000 SolarWinds customers affected, the attackers probably wanted to avoid any risk of
detection in organizations that weren’t of interest to them.
Interestingly, the process solarwindsdiagnostics is also blacklisted. Presumably this is
included to avoid detection during any SolarWinds testing or troubleshooting.

Disabling security software
Sunburst also attempts to specifically disable some software security services via the
registry. This allows Sunburst to perform its malicious actions completely undetected. If the
attackers worked quickly and restored the services afterwards, a security administrator would
potentially have no record of the activity, nor have even noticed the temporary lack of
protection.

3/15

Figure 1. Example of how Sunburst disables security software. In this case it checks if the
CrowdStrike processes csfalconservice or csfalconcontainer are running, and if so, it sets the
csagent, csfalconservice, and csdevicecontrol services to be disabled.
This function will:
Get a list of running processes
Check if the process names match items on the process/services name pair list
Disable the security software by modifying its service registry entry

4/15

After the software has been confirmed to be disabled, usually after a reboot, the
malicious code will then contact the command and control (C&C) server and potentially
perform further malicious actions
To disable the security software, Sunburst will simply set the products’ service start setting to
Disabled. In Windows, this is done by setting the registry keys:
HKLM\ SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\<service name>\Start = 4
This will cause the security software not to load at the next reboot.
It should be noted that the attackers do not attempt to disable any Symantec products.
Presumably this is because of an anti-tampering feature in Symantec software, which
prevents its own service from being disabled.
The process and services pair list include software from the following vendors:
CrowdStrike
Carbon Black
FireEye
ESET
F-Secure
Interestingly, the list also included Microsoft Defender, but only the service key permissions
are changed. Currently, this has an unknown effect. In addition, some other unknown
products are also included, but were effectively commented out. The attackers may have
discovered this technique was ineffective for these products.
Finally, Sunburst will check if api.solarwinds.com resolves to a valid address before
continuing.

Low profile threat
The SolarWinds attacks are among the best-planned and adept attacks we have seen in
recent years. The attackers have gone to great lengths to both find an effective path into
their targeted organizations and, once inside their networks, maintain a low profile. Our
analysis of these tools is ongoing and we plan to publish further blogs in the coming weeks.

Protection/Mitigation
Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running
Symantec Endpoint products.
