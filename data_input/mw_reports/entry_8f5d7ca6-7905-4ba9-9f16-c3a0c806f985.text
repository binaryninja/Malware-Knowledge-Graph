FluBot Variant Masquerading As The Default Android Voicemail
App

September 9, 2021

During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a sample of the FluBot
malware from our OSINT research. This variant calls itself “Voicemail” to trick users into thinking that it’s the
default Voicemail app.
FluBot is a type of malware that operates by taking over devices, collecting sensitive information from them,
and even sending messages to the victim’s contacts.
The application uses Smishing (a combination of SMS+Phishing) attacks to spread the malware. In the case
of phishing, attackers send fraudulent emails that trick recipients into opening an attachment which includes
malware, or by clicking on a malicious link. In the case of Smishing, emails are replaced by text messages.
Cyble Research Labs downloaded the malware sample and performed a detailed analysis. Through our
analysis, we determined that the malware performs suspicious activities such as reading Contact data, SMS
data, and device notifications.
The malware explicitly requests users for complete control of their devices. After gaining full access and
permissions, the malware further enhances its functionalities.
The image below shows the statistical view of FluBot samples distributed by the attackers observed through
our open-source analysis from one of our Threat hunting sources. Refer to Figure 1.

APK Metadata Information
Figure 2 shows the metadata information of the application.

Figure 2: Metadata Information
We have outlined the flow of the application and the various activities conducted by it. Refer to Figure 3.
The application asks the users to turn on the accessibility service.
The application asks for complete control of the device.
The application asks the users to allow access to notifications.
The application asks the users to allow it to replace the default SMS app. Once it gets this permission,
the application can handle SMS data.

Figure 3: Application Start Flow
Upon simulating the application, it requests that users enable the Accessibility service. Attackers can abuse
this service to carry out malicious activities such as clicking buttons remotely to gain admin privileges and
trick users into clicking on overlay content over the screen. Refer to Figure 4.

Figure 4: Requests Accessibility

Service
Figure 5 shows the malware asking users to give them complete access to the device. Once the malware
gains complete control over the device, it can perform the following activities:
View and control screen.
Control device data, including contacts, SMSs, and pictures.
Delete or manipulate the device’s data.

Figure 5: Asks for Full Control

Figure 6 shows that the malware asks the users to enable Notification access for the application. Once the
application gets notification access, it can read all notifications on the device, including the SMS data of the
device.

Figure 6: Asks for Notification

Access
Upon receiving notification access, the application requests users to make the application their default SMS
app. Upon becoming the default SMS app, the app proceeds with its malicious activities. Refer to Figure 7.

App Permission

Manifest Description
Voicemail requests sixteen different permissions, of which the attackers could abuse seven. In this case, the
malware can:
Reads SMS and Contacts data.
Make calls without user intervention
Delete SMS data
Can kill background process of other apps
Receive and send SMSs
We have listed the dangerous permissions below.
Permissions

Description

READ_SMS

Access phone messages.

6/12

READ_CONTACTS

Access phone contacts.

WRITE_SMS

Allows applications to write SMS messages. Malicious apps may
manipulate SMS data.

KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES

Allows applications to kill the background processes of other apps.

CALL_PHONE

Allows an application to initiate a phone call without going through
the Dialer user interface to confirm the call.

RECEIVE_SMS

Allows an application to receive SMS messages.

SEND_SMS

Allows an application to send SMS messages.

Table 1: Permissions’ Description
Upon reviewing the code of the application, we identified the launcher activity of the malicious app as shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Launcher Activity
We were able to identify that the permissions and services defined in the manifest file can replace the
default Messages app. After getting default app permissions, this app will be able to handle sending and
receiving SMSs and MMSs. Refer to Figure 9.

Figure 9: Handles SMS and MMS
Figure 10 demonstrates that the malware has defined customized services that leverage the
BROADCAST_WAP_PUSH service. Using this service, an application can broadcast a notification stating
that a WAP Push message has been received.

Figure 10: Using Broadcast WAP Push Permission
Threat Actors (TAs) can abuse this service to generate false MMS message receipts or replace the original
content with malicious content. As per Google, this service is not for use by third-party applications.

7/12

Figure 11 demonstrates that the malware has defined customized services that leverage the permission
SEND_RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE, permitting the application to send a request to other messaging apps
to handle Respond-via-Message action for incoming calls.

Source Code Description
The code given in Figure 12 shows that the malware is capable of reading Contact data.

Figure 12: Reads Contact Data
The code shown in Figure 13 demonstrates that the malware is capable of sending text messages as well.

Figure 13: Sending SMS
The code in Figure 14 shows that the malware is capable of reading notification data and removing the
notifications altogether.

Figure 14: Reads Notification Data
The code shown in Figure 15 demonstrates the encryption technique used by the malware to encrypt the
data.

Figure 15: Encryption Technique Used by the Malware
The below code shows encrypted strings. After decrypting some strings, we determined that they also
contain the FluBot malware variant version information. Refer to Figure 16.

9/12

Figure 16: Encrypted Strings
The malware obfuscates certain data such as strings, Command and Control (C&C) Commands, malicious
APIs using custom encryption techniques.
Upon analyzing the sample, we found that the malware uses a simple XOR algorithm. The input to the
algorithm has been stored in the form of integers. Refer to Figure 17.

Traffic Analysis Description
During our traffic analysis, we observed the malware communicating with various IP addresses. Refer to
Figure 18.

Figure 18: Communicates with the Server
Figure 19 shows that the malware has hardcoded data, i.e., the malicious URL, based out of Russia.

Conclusion
Threat Actors constantly adapt their methods to avoid detection and find new ways to target users through
sophisticated techniques. Such malicious applications often masquerade as legitimate applications to
confuse users into installing them.
Users should install applications only after verifying their authenticity and install them exclusively from the
official Google Play Store to avoid exposure to such attacks.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Users should be careful while enabling any permissions on their devices.
If you find any suspicious applications on your device, uninstall, or delete them immediately.
Use the shared IOCs to monitor and block the malware infection.
Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.
Keep your Android device, OS, and applications updated to the latest versions.
Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
