APT Actors Exploiting Fortinet Vulnerabilities to
Gain Access for Malicious Activity
Summary
The FBI is continuing to warn about Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
actors exploiting Fortinet vulnerabilities. As of at least May 2021, an
APT actor group almost certainly exploited a Fortigate appliance to
access a webserver hosting the domain for a U.S. municipal
government. The APT actors likely created an account with the
username “elie” to further enable malicious activity on the network.
The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) previously warned in April 2021 that APT actors had gained
access to devices on ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for Fortinet FortiOS
CVE-2018-13379, and enumerated devices for FortiOS CVE-202012812 and FortiOS CVE-2019-5591.
Access gained by the APT actors can be leveraged to conduct data
exfiltration, data encryption, or other malicious activity. The APT
actors are actively targeting a broad range of victims across multiple
sectors, indicating the activity is focused on exploiting vulnerabilities
rather than targeted at specific sectors. Please see Joint Cybersecurity
Advisory AA21-092A, published 2 April 2021, for more information on
this activity.

Technical Details
The FBI identified the following indicators of compromise (IOCs) that we assess are likely associated
with this APT activity.
New User Accounts
The APT actors may have established new user accounts on domain controllers, servers,
workstations, and the active directories. Some of these accounts appear to have been created to
look similar to other existing accounts on the network, so specific account names may vary per
organization. In addition to unrecognized user accounts or accounts established to masquerade as
existing accounts, the following account usernames may be associated with this activity:
• “elie”
• “WADGUtilityAccount”

Recommended Mitigations
• Immediately patch CVEs 2018-13379, 2020-12812, and 2019-5591.
• If FortiOS is not used by your organization, add the key artifact files used by FortiOS to your
organization’s execution denylist. Any attempts to install or run this program and its associated
files should be prevented.
• Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized
user accounts.
• Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review
operating system defined or recognized scheduled tasks for unrecognized “actions” (for example:
review the steps each scheduled task is expected to perform).
• Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.
• Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data
resides.
• Implement network segmentation.
• Require administrator credentials to install software.
• Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data
and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device,
the cloud).
• Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are
released.
• Use multifactor authentication where possible.
• Regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts, and avoid reusing passwords for
different accounts. Implement the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.
• Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote
access/RDP logs.
• Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least
privilege in mind.
• Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.
• Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a
virtual private network (VPN).
• Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
• Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
