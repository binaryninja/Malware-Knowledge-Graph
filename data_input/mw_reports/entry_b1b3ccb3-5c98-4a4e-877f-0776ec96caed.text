October 21, 2021

The intelligence in this report was gathered by a source who was recruited by “Bastion
Secure”. Gemini Advisory’s investigation and analysis of the source’s information has been
ongoing for the past several months. Although sensitive information has been redacted from
this report to protect the source, Gemini Advisory has provided law enforcement with the
complete set of unredacted information. In addition, our findings were reported to our clients
earlier this month and have been corroborated by Microsoft’s presentation at Mandiant Cyber
Defense Summit 2021.

Key Findings
The cybercriminal group FIN7 has been responsible for large-scale card theft
campaigns, resulting in the exposure of over 20 million payment card records, as well
as ransomware attacks. Gemini has discovered that FIN7 is now running a new fake
company called “Bastion Secure”, replacing the previously reported “Combi Security”.

Bastion Secure offered a job offer to a Gemini source and, in the process, provided the
source with files that analysts later determined were for the post-exploitation tools
Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion. These two tools have been previously attributed to FIN7
and establish the link between Bastion Secure and FIN7.
The tasks that were assigned to the Gemini source by FIN7—operating under the guise
of Bastion Secure—matched the steps taken to prepare a ransomware attack,
providing further evidence that FIN7 has continued to expand into the ransomware
sphere.
FIN7 can pay unwitting “employees” far less than it would have to pay informed
criminal accomplices for its ransomware schemes. However, FIN7’s greed also
afforded Gemini a view into the proprietary data of this prolific threat team, leading to
the exposure of another fake FIN7 company.

Background
The cybercriminal group FIN7 gained notoriety in the mid-2010s for large-scale malware
campaigns targeting the point-of-sale (POS) systems. In 2018, Gemini Advisory reported
FIN7’s compromise of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor stores and the subsequent sale
of over 5 million payment cards on the dark web. According to the US Department of Justice,
the broader FIN7 carding campaigns have resulted in the theft of over 20 million payment
card records and cost victims over $1 billion, making FIN7 one of the most infamous and
prolific cybercriminal groups of the last decade. Now with ransomware proving to be
cybercriminals’ preferred high-profit, jackpot venture, FIN7 has redeployed their expertise
and capacity towards ransomware, with reports indicating that the group was involved in
attempted ransomware attacks on US companies as early as 2020. Furthermore, despite
focus from law enforcement and the arrest of four FIN7 members from 2018 to 2020, FIN7’s
continued activity shows that the group remains a powerful, active threat.
In 2018, the US Department of Justice revealed that FIN7 was posing as “Combi Security”, a
fake cybersecurity company, to involve unaware IT specialists in their carding campaigns.
While the public focus on Combi Security shut down that operation, Gemini has now
discovered that FIN7 is using a new fake cybersecurity company named “Bastion Secure” to
lure unaware IT specialists into supporting its continued expansion into ransomware.
Over the course of FIN7’s existence, cybersecurity firms have referred to FIN7 by several
names—including Carbanak, Carbon Spider, Anunak, Cobalt Gang, and Navigator Group—
with some practitioners choosing to subdivide the FIN7 designation according to the target
type. While overlapping but different groups of individuals have likely conducted malicious
activity attributed to these threat groups, the unifying thread connecting the attack signatures
to FIN7 has been the use of the malware Carbanak.

Analysis

2/13

A Gemini source was offered a position as an IT specialist at “Bastion Secure Ltd”, a
cybersecurity “company” seeking C++, Python, and PHP programmers, system
administrators, and reverse engineers. A basic search for this company returns a legitimateappearing website (www[.]bastionsecure[.]com), but analysis revealed that it is a fictitious
cybersecurity company run by a cybercriminal group. During the interview process, the
source was given several tools for test assignments that the source would use if employed.
Gemini Advisory worked jointly with the Recorded Future Insikt Group to analyze the tools
provided by Bastion Secure and determined that they are actually components of the postexploitation toolkits Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion, both of which have been previously attributed
to the FIN7 group and can be used for both POS system infections and ransomware attacks.
Prior to 2020, FIN7’s primary modus operandi was to compromise companies’ networks and
infect POS systems with credit card-stealing malware. Since 2020, cybersecurity researchers
have identified instances in which FIN7 gained access to company networks that were later
infected with either REvil or Ryuk ransomware. FIN7’s exact involvement in the deployment
of ransomware—i.e., whether they sold the access to ransomware groups or have formed a
partnership with these groups—remains unclear. However, the tasks that were assigned to
the Gemini source by FIN7 (operating under the guise of Bastion Secure) matched the steps
taken to prepare a ransomware attack, providing further evidence that FIN7 has expanded
into the ransomware sphere.
Furthermore, due to Bastion Secure’s use of Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion and FIN7’s
established practice of using fake cybersecurity companies to recruit talent, Gemini assesses
with high confidence that FIN7 is using the fictitious company Bastion Secure to recruit
unwitting IT specialists into participating in ransomware attacks.

Russian job site superjob.ru.
More broadly, FIN7’s decision to use a fake cybersecurity company to recruit IT specialists
for its criminal activity is driven by FIN7’s desire for comparatively cheap, skilled labor.
Bastion Secure’s job offers for IT specialist positions ranged between $800 and $1,200 USD
a month, which is a viable starting salary for this type of position in post-Soviet states.
However, this “salary” would be a small fraction of a cybercriminal’s portion of the criminal
profits from a successful ransomware extortion or large-scale payment card-stealing
operation. In effect, FIN7’s fake company scheme enables the operators of FIN7 to obtain
the talent that the group needs to carry out its criminal activities, while simultaneously
retaining a larger share of the profits.
FIN7’s use of Bastion Secure—even after the discovery of Combi Security, the group’s
previous fake cybersecurity company—indicates that FIN7 continues to believe that hiring
unwitting IT specialists is the group’s best method for balancing the need for a technically
skilled team against the operators’ desire for maximum profits.

Bastion Secure
With FIN7’s latest fake company, Bastion Secure, the criminal group leveraged true, publicly
available information from various legitimate cybersecurity companies to create a thin veil of
legitimacy around Bastion Secure. In effect, FIN7 is adopting disinformation tactics so that if

4/13

a potential hire or interested party were to fact check Bastion Secure, then a cursory search
on Google would return “true” information for companies with a similar name or industry to
FIN7’s Bastion Secure.
FIN7’s first step in obtaining a veil of legitimacy was to give their fake company the generic
name “Bastion Secure”, which appears similar to several unrelated security-adjacent
companies with highly listed Google search results:
Bastion Security Products Ltd: a US physical security company that was recently
acquired by ECAMSECURE
Bastion Security Group: a US physical security consulting company
Second, Bastion Secure listed the company’s office addresses as:
16e Follingsby Ave, Gateshead, United Kingdom (former address of the since-closed
Bastion Security (North) Limited)
94 Yigal Alon St. Tower 1, Tel Aviv, Israel (office building containing multiple
businesses, including the vehicle security company Cymotive)
Imperia Tower, 12 Presnenskaya Embankment, Moscow, 123100 Russia (office
building containing multiple businesses). Gemini contacted the Imperia Tower building
administrators, who confirmed that there is no company named Bastion Secure with
office space at the building.
Fortis Tower, 77-79 Gloucester Rd, Wan Chai, Hong Kong (office building containing
multiple businesses). Fortis Tower building administrators did not respond to Gemini’s
inquiries; however, public records in the Hong Kong government’s “Companies
Registry’s Cyber Search Centre” revealed that there is no registered company named
“Bastion Secure” operating in Hong Kong.
Furthermore, the Bastion Secure website itself also appears legitimate at first glance;
however, a deeper analysis revealed that the website is largely a copy of the website of
Convergent Network Solutions Ltd., a legitimate cybersecurity company. Additionally, the
Bastion Secure website is hosted on the Russian domain registrar Beget, which
cybercriminals commonly use.

sentence includes text directly from the CNS website.
An initial analysis of the Bastion Secure website revealed that most of the submenus of the
site return a Russian-language HTTP 404 error, indicating that the site creators were
Russian speakers. Since the initial analysis by Gemini, most of the website’s submenus have
been fixed with appropriate pages; however, a deeper analysis revealed that some of the
HTTP 404 errors remain unfixed.

As shown in the image below, an analysis of the page’s source code reveals the remnants of
the CNS site: the code on Bastion Secure still lists the same phone number that is listed
prominently on the CNS homepage.

Network Solutions Ltd’s website.
To recruit IT specialists, Bastion Secure posts legitimate-appearing job offers on both their
website and prominent job search sites in post-Soviet states, as well as providing reputablelooking contacts to potential hires for additional credibility. In the past several months,
Bastion Secure has posted job offerings for system administrators on job search sites and
added new vacancies for PHP, Python, and C++ programmers and reverse engineers on
their website. On these job sites, Bastion Secure provides sufficiently professional
information to appear legitimate and includes purported office information and a phone
number (+7 499-642-3420). The list of legitimate Russian and Ukrainian job sites where
Bastion Secure has a presence and has advertised job postings includes:

FIN7—operating under the guise of Bastion Secure—is looking for programmers (PHP, C++,
Python), system administrators, and reverse engineers in order to build a “staff” capable of
conducting the tasks necessary for undertaking a range of cybercriminal activity. Given
FIN7’s increased interest in ransomware, Bastion Secure is likely specifically looking for
system administrators because an individual with this skill set would be able to:
Map out compromised companies’ systems
Identify users and devices within the systems
Locate backup servers and files
In order for the system administrator to map out a victim’s system, FIN7 would need to first
provide the individual with access to the system. FIN7 operators could obtain the initial
access through their well-documented phishing and social engineering methods or by
purchasing access on dark web forums from a large pool of vendors. Once the system
administrator mapped out the system and identified backups, FIN7 could then escalate to the
next step in the malware and ransomware infection process. Gemini Advisory has previously
written reports on how ransomware teams operate and some of their TTP’s.

FIN7’s Bastion Secure Reveals Criminality During Hiring Process

9/13

A Gemini source made contact with a Bastion Secure “HR representative” on a job search
site, leading to a hiring process in which Bastion Secure shared their business practices and
access to several of their tools. Gemini analyzed these tools to discover that they were in
fact the post-exploitation tools Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion. As various security practitioners
have already attributed these tools and ransomware attacks to the FIN7 group, the fact that
Bastion Secure representatives provided the source with disguised versions of these
attributable post-exploitation tools establishes a strong link between Bastion Secure and
FIN7.

First Stage: Interview Process
The first stage of the hiring process proceeded similarly to a legitimate job hiring process and
gave no indication that Bastion Secure was a fake company for a cybercriminal group. First,
the HR representative from Bastion Secure communicated with the Gemini source and
informed them that they had reviewed the source’s resume and were interested in hiring
them as an IT specialist.
After the source indicated that they were interested in the position, the source conducted a
typical first-stage interview with the HR representative via messages on Telegram. Although
many non-criminal individuals in post-Soviet states use Telegram as their preferred
messaging app, it is not typical for initial professional correspondences to be conducted on
Telegram.
After completing the interviews, the source was informed that they would need to:
Complete several test assignments before beginning on a probationary basis
Sign a contract and non-disclosure agreement
Configure their computer by installing several virtual machines and opening ports

Second Stage: Practice Assignments
At face value, the second stage of the hiring process did not give a clear indication that
Bastion Secure is a cybercriminal operation. However, the actions taken later in the third
stage clearly made the steps taken in the second stage highly suspicious. The source was
instructed to install certain platforms and conduct a series of practice assignments that would
be typical for the position.
Bastion Secure also informed the source that they were willing to train new hires in
cybersecurity. When the source indicated that they were interested in learning, the company
sent them additional files that included tools that could either be used for legitimate
penetration testing or malicious activity. Although the tools provided to the source were
potentially unusual for the position, Bastion Secure prefaced it by proposing that they would
train the source to not only manage client’s systems but also secure them, lending credence
to the use of these tools.

10/13

Third Stage: “Real” Assignment Signals Criminal Intent
In the third stage, Bastion Secure gave the source their first “real” assignment, and it became
immediately clear that the company was involved in criminal activity. The fact that the Bastion
Secure representatives were particularly interested in file systems and backups signals that
FIN7 was more interested in conducting ransomware attacks than POS infections.
For the first assignment, Bastion Secure provided the Gemini source with a “client company”
to work on. The task would have been to use a script to collect information on domain
administrators, domain trust relationships, file shares, backups, and hypervisors (the
software responsible for creating and running virtual machines). At this point, the source
became highly suspicious of Bastion Secure’s activities, noting the following red flags from
earlier in the hiring process:
Bastion Secure provided access to the company’s network without any legal
documentation or explanation, suggesting that the access may have been acquired
through social engineering or purchased on the dark web
Bastion Secure was only interested in file systems and backup
The company warned of a heavy fine if the source installed antivirus software on the
virtual machine that they were using
The employee was required to use specific tools to avoid detection
Bastion Secure software was purportedly licensed to “Checkpoint Software Inc”, which
may have been an attempt to masquerade the software as a product of the legitimate
company Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Security researchers have
previously reported that FIN7 has attempted to do this in the past as well.

Attribution
Gemini analyzed the files that were sent to the source by Bastion Secure and found that the
files contained components for the post-exploitation tools Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion. Postexploitation tools—which are part of any ransomware group’s toolkit—allow malicious actors
to control infected computers after they have gained initial access to the victim company’s
network. Various security practitioners have previously attributed the use of Carbanak and
Lizar/Tirion to FIN7. These two factors indicate that FIN7 operators are sharing a partially
disguised version of its toolkit with unwitting accomplices through the fake company Bastion
Secure.
The files provided to the source by Bastion Secure included files for a software component
titled “Command Manager” that was, in fact, a disguised version of the client component of
Carbanak (see image 12). Gemini determined this by analyzing the software’s functionality
and concluded that it is an updated version of previously identified versions of Carbanak.
The main functions of the Carbanak command manager are collecting information about an
infected computer and obtaining remote access to the infected computer.

of Carbanak.
The files contained an obfuscated PowerShell script that ultimately launches the Lizar/Tirion
injector and payload. The primary function of the loader is to receive periodic commands
from the C&C server and execute the commands on the infected computer. The commands
executed by the loader on the infected computer are “modules” and the results are sent back
to the C&C server. These modules can be .dll, .exe, and .ps1 file types.

Image 13: The malware operator uses the client to issue commands to the loader, which is
located on the infected machine.

Conclusion
Although cybercriminals looking for unwitting accomplices on legitimate job sites is nothing
new, the sheer scale and blatancy with which FIN7 operates continue to surpass the
behavior shown by other cybercriminal groups. Not only is FIN7 looking for unwitting victims
on legitimate job sites, but also attempting to obfuscate its true identity as a prolific
cybercriminal and ransomware group by creating a fabricated web presence through a
largely legitimate-appearing website, professional job postings, and company info pages on
Russian-language business development sites.

12/13

FIN7’s decision to hire unwitting accomplices, as opposed to finding willing accomplices on
the dark web, is likely due to greed. With willing accomplices, FIN7 would be forced to share
a percentage of ransom payments totaling millions of dollars, whereas unwitting “employees”
would work for monthly salaries in the low thousands, which are commensurate with the
labor markets in post-Soviet states. However, FIN7’s greed also afforded Gemini a view into
the proprietary tools of this prolific threat team, as well as the exposure of another fake FIN7
company.
Correction (11/05/2021): The report incorrectly stated that a FIN7 system administrator was
arrested in 2021. The individual was arrested in 2018 and sentenced in 2021. Four FIN7
members were arrested between 2018 and 2020.
