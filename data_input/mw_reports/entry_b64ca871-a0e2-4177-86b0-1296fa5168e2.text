Supply chain attacks

1 Introduction
This document aims at warning about a cyber threat targeting service providers and design offices. Attackers are
compromising these enterprise networks in order to access data and eventually the networks of their clients.
Information provided in this report is based on ANSSI’s investigations following incident response activities. At this
point, analysis suggests two waves of attacks separated in time and without technical evidence of a link between
them. The ﬁrst wave uses mainly the PlugX malware. The second wave relies on legitimate tools and credentials
theft.
This document focuses on the second and most recent wave and the intrusion set1 involved in it. Appendix only
focuses on the PlugX malware (chapter 6).

2 Attack chain
2.1 Initial access
To gain initial foothold on targeted networks, the attackers exploit vulnerabilities on low-secured services exposed
on the Internet, discovered through scanning with tools like Acunetix. Other methods may also be used such as
phishing emails or usage of leaked credentials.

2.2 Access and persistence
To access the targeted networks after initial compromise, the attackers use legitimate VPN credentials that have
probably been stolen on the victim’s network.
The attackers may use other methods such as installed RATs (Remote Access Tool) or other backdoors like webshells,
as demonstrated during former intrusions using PlugX malwares.

2.3 Privilege escalation
In order to acquire higher privileges on victim’s machines, the attackers use legitimate tools such as ProcDump or
Certmig (see section 3.2). Administrator accounts with a naming pattern incoherent with the usual patterns used
by the victims have been observed on targeted networks (for instance an account named « aaaa »).

2.4 Lateral movement
RDP connections with stolen credentials are mainly used by the attackers to move inside the compromised network,
as well as Netscan commands and WMIExec scripts.

2.5 Objectives
The ﬁrst objective of the attackers seem to be the understanding of the network conﬁguration and its external
authenticated connections to clients.
After such information is acquired, the attackers move to the client network in order to gather relevant information.
This information can be exﬁltrated through the service provider or the client network.

1 Characteristic tools, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by one or several malicious actors accross one or several attack campaigns.

It can be seen as an identity card of a threat which should not be confused with an attacker or group of attackers linked to a broader concept
involving individuals and physical organisations.

2.6 Operational security
Even if the sophistication of the tools used by the attackers is quite low, they are well organised in the deletion and
the deactivation of all activity logs on devices they visit.
Incoming connections of the attackers are anonymized through IP addresses belonging to VPN providers or TOR
network.

3 Tools and malwares
3.1 Custom malware
In addition to all legitimate tools described below, the attackers use a custom piece of malware they may have
developped.
This custom malware is designed to monitor the web browsers of a victim. This enables the gathering of credentials
and session cookies. This malware communicates with a C2 server through HTTP or HTTPS.

3.2 Legitimate tools
The attackers have used the following legitimate tools:
• ProcDump: command-line tool used to monitor a running process and dump memory depending on custom
criteria. The attackers use this tool to dump the LSASS process to gather WINDOWS credentials hashes;
• CertMig: command-line tool used to import and export certiﬁcates on a machine. The attackers use this tool
to gather credentials used for VPN authentication to the clients’ networks;
• WMIExec.vbs: tool used to remotely administrate a machine in VBScript with functionalities similar to SysInternals PsExec;
• rar.exe: command-line version of the ﬁle compression utility WINRAR. The attackers use this tool to compress,
protect and split both exﬁltrated data and imported toolset;
• MimiKatz: tool used for diverse actions on a WINDOWS system such as injection of libraries, process tampering
and credential dumping;
• Netscan: tool used to scan IPv4/IPv6 networks and remotely execute PowerShell commands.

4 Detection methods for these attackers
In observed incidents, attackers have mainly used legitimate credentials and tools. IOC-based detection is therefore
unefficient in this case.
The following rules do not give a full certainty on the attackers presence on an information system but matching
circumstances should be investigated as a potential compromise.

4.1 VPN connections
4.1.1 Source of connection
The attackers mainly rely on commercial VPN services as well as the TOR network to anonymize their incoming
connections.
In most cases, IP addresses of VPN clients have Whois records linked to popular commercial VPN services used for
web navigation (HTTP/HTTPS) and emails (SMTP/SMTPS).

However, users connecting to a company VPN through a commercial VPN exit node or a TOR node is an anomaly.
Detection rule: look for incoming connections in VPN or VDI logs with a source which is an exit node in the
following table. This list is not comprehensive.

4.1.2 MAC address of the attackers
In some cases, the MAC address of the source machine is recorded in VPN logs.
In most cases observed during these attack campaigns, the attackers have used VMWARE virtual machines to connect
to their victims.
If this information is logged and depending on the usages of VMWARE inside a company, incoming connections
with VMWARE MAC addresses may be linked to an attack.
Detection rule: look for VPN connections with a client network interface MAC address starting with a VMWARE
attributed preﬁx.
Preﬁx
00:0c:29
00:50:56
00:1C:14
00:05:69

4.1.3 Incoherent user accounts
The attackers are using legitimate credentials to connect to the victim’s VPN endpoint and computers. Interestingly, they are using different accounts for the VPN authentication and for the WINDOWS domain authentication.
This is an anomaly for most companies. Looking for users using a different account for the domain authentication
compared to the one used for the VPN authentication has uncovered most of the hostile connections.
Detection rule: among IP addresses assigned to the VPN which are authenticating on the WINDOWS domain, look
for a different identity than the one used on the VPN.

4.2 System indicators
4.2.1 Uncommon folders
The attackers have mainly used two types of folders to save tools and archives.
The ﬁrst category contains folders named as antivirus software installation folders such as:
• \ProgramData\ESETOEM
• \ProgramData\McAfeeOEM
The second category contains folders existing for most MICROSOFT WINDOWS installations but which should not
contain any executables or RAR archives such as:

• \ProgramData
• c:\windows\AppPatch
• c:\PerfLogs and subfolders.
Generally speaking, having these types of ﬁles in these folders is an anomaly and should be investigated.
Detection rule: look for executables or archives (Zip, RAR) created in folders
\ProgramData\ESETOEM, \ProgramData\McAfeeOEM, \ProgramData or c:\PerfLogs.

Setup of network port forwardings
The attackers have used the WINDOWS ﬁrewall to set up port forwarding between their entry point and their ﬁnal
victim.
To do so, the netsh command has been used as follows:
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport =443 connectaddress =XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX connectport =443

This command will set up a forward on port TCP/443 from the compromised workstation to the target XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
on port TCP/443.
When this command is executed, it will create and set a registry key.
Interestingly, when the conﬁguration is later disabled, the key content is erased, but the key is not deleted.
This kind of conﬁguration is rare in WINDOWS environments. Looking for machines where this key is positioned
has been a reliable indicator of compromise.
Detection rule: look for the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet{0,n}\services\PortProxy\v4tov4 on WINDOWS machines.

5 Recommendations
5.1 For service providers
In order to prevent as much as possible these incidents, ANSSI recommends the following best practices to service
providers and design offices:
• Use secure administration methods on IT systems (ANSSI’s recommendations to secure administration of IT
systems);
• Set up a security monitoring capability;
• Make a list of connections with clients and monitor them;
• Segregate clients between them.

5.2 For clients
In order to prevent as much as possible these incidents, ANSSI recommends the following best practices to clients
of service providers:
• Use secure administration methods on IT systems (ANSSI’s recommendations to secure administration of IT
systems);
• Set up a security monitoring capability;
• Make a list of connections with service providers and monitor them;
• Apply a least privilege model to accesses given to external entities (accounts, connections, trust relashionships).

6 Appendix: PlugX
PlugX malware has only been observed during the ﬁrst wave of attack. As a reminder, ANSSI is not able to link
this phase with the second one for now.

6.1 Description
PlugX is a malware family also known as KorPlug, SOGU, Scontroller, etc. The main function of this malware is
to take control of a remote host. System artefacts observed show that the DLL sideloading method is used to load
the malware in the host memory.

6.2 SNORT rules
The following SNORT rules detect communications linked to PlugX version 2 (source : https://www.us-cert.
gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A):
