Shade ransomware is a long-established family of ransomware first spotted in late 2014
targeting hosts running Microsoft Windows. It is also known as Troldesh. Shade has been
distributed through malicious spam (malspam) and exploit kits. A recent report focused on
Russian language emails that deliver Shade, but this ransomware is also distributed through
English-language malspam.
Where is Shade currently appearing? To answer this question, we reviewed recent trends in
Shade ransomware among our customer base. Our results indicate the majority of recent
Shade ransomware executables have also targeted users outside of Russia.
In fact, our research shows that the top five countries affected by Shade ransomware are not
Russia or nations of the former Soviet Union, they are the United States, Japan, India,
Thailand, and Canada, Russia only occurs at number seven and the only other country we
found in the top ten where Russian is an official language is Kazakhstan at number ten. The
top industries attacked in these countries were High-Tech, Wholesale, and Education.
Very Little Change Since 2016

1/8

The Shade ransomware executable (EXE) has been remarkably consistent. All EXE samples
we have analyzed since 2016 use the same Tor address at cryptsen7f043rr6.onion as a
decryptor page. The desktop background that appears during an infection has been the
same since Shade was first reported as Troldesh in late 2014.
Shade ransomware infections may include other activity like click fraud traffic as noted here.
Russian and English Language Distribution
Recent reports of malspam pushing Shade ransomware have focused on distribution through
Russian language emails. However, Shade decryption instructions have always included
English as well as Russian text. English language waves of malspam have been noted
pushing Shade ransomware, like this wave of IRS notifications targeting recipients in the
United States in 2017.
What does a Shade infection look like?
When a Windows host is infected with Shade ransomware, its desktop background
announces the infection, and ten text files appear on the desktop named README1.txt
through README10.txt as shown in Figure 1.

The ten README files all contain the same instructions as shown in Figure 2.

Since June 2016, file extensions for any encrypted files are .crypted000007 as shown in
Figure 3.

Shade Distribution through Malspam
Malspam-based infections for Shade ransomware involve a JavaScript (.js) or other type of
script-based file disguised as an invoice or bill. In some cases, Shade malspam has links for
these script-based files. In other cases, the files are directly attached to the emails within a
zip file or other type of archive. In February 2019, waves of Russian-language malspam used
attached PDF files with links to download zip archives containing these script-based files.
In all cases we have reviewed, a .js or other script-based file was involved as indicated in
Figure 4. These script-based files are designed to retrieve executable files for Shade
ransomware.

Executable delivery during the infection chain
Malspam-based Shade infection chains have one thing in common. They all involve
retrieving an executable file from a compromised server. By focusing on the executable in
this chain of events, we can determine where Shade ransomware infection attempts have
occurred.
AutoFocus search parameters
AutoFocus has a Shade ransomware tag that identifies any items associated with Shade
ransomware. We searched on attempted deliveries of a Shade ransomware executable
during an infection chain, and we focused our search on packed executable (PE) files sent
through a URL over TCP port 80.
Since we're trying to determine geographic locations among our customer base where
Shade ransomware attempts have happened, we looked for the country of Palo Alto
Networks devices that discovered these attempts.
This search is for the first quarter of 2019.
Finally, our query eliminated any obvious malware submissions to online sandboxes and
online sharing services. Our search parameters from the AutoFocus database were:
Date is in the range from January 1st through March 31st
Unit 42 tag is for Shade ransomware
File type is PE
File URL has any value but is not unknown
Source port (the TCP port the file came from) is 80
Device Country has any value (is not blank or unidentified)
File URL does not contain the string /malware/
File URL does not contain the string malshare.com
File URL does not contain the string paloaltonetworks

File URL does not contain the string local

2019.
Results from January through March 2019
Our search results from January through March 2019 revealed 307 Shade ransomware
samples over 6,536 sessions. Each session represents an HTTP request for a URL hosting
a Shade ransomware executable. Many of these URLs were seen multiple times in separate
sessions. Locations of our top ten results were:
United States - 2,010 sessions
Japan - 1,677 sessions
India - 989 sessions
Thailand - 723 sessions
Canada - 712 sessions
Spain - 505 sessions
Russian Federation - 86 sessions
France - 71 sessions
United Kingdom - 67 sessions
Kazakhstan - 21 sessions

Figure 6. Top ten countries from our AutoFocus search results as shown on a world map.
The top country with Shade ransomware infection attempts among our customer base was
the United States. The vast majority of these for URLs hosting Shade ransomware
executables were reported from customer devices outside of Russia and Russian language
countries.
The top 10 verticals for this period were:
High Tech: 5,009 sessions
Wholesale and Retail: 722 sessions
Education: 720 sessions
Telecommunications: 311 sessions
Finance: 51 sessions
Transportation and Logistics: 24 sessions
Manufacturing: 32 sessions
Professional and Legal Services: 8 sessions
Utilities and Energy: 4 sessions
State and Local Government: 1 session
Conclusion
The top country with Shade ransomware infection attempts among our customer base was
the United States. The vast majority of these for URLs hosting Shade ransomware
executables were reported from customer devices outside of Russia and Russian language
countries.

7/8

The most common target for Shade ransomware infection attempts were organizations that
fell under the High Tech category.
These results are likely skewed towards English due to our customer base. However, they
indicate Shade ransomware is very active outside of Russia and possibly targeting more
English-speaking victims than Russian.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Shade ransomware by our threat
prevention platform which easily detects these executables. AutoFocus users can track
Shade ransomware attempts by using the Shade tag. See the appendices below for details
on recent Shade ransomware samples we discovered in March and April 2019.
