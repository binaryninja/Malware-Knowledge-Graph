“Cracked” Versions of RedLine Stealer
Threat actors continue to distribute “cracked” versions of
RedLine Stealer in 2021. The distribution of cracked versions of
RedLine Stealer is not a new phenomenon and has been reported
as far back as 2020. While the validity of these cracked versions
of the stealer from over a year ago is less certain, actors in
2021 attempting to gain access to the malware are more likely to
rely on recent iterations of RedLine Stealer that were reportedly
leaked across multiple sources within the past two months.

According to REDGLade, there are 2 types of subscription
licenses for the latest malware variants:
• “PRO”, a lifetime license available for $800 with 3 months
of free crypt service and antivirus scan check
• “Lite”, a 1-month license with 1 month of free crypt
service available for $150
REDGLade previously provided discounts to buyers, and
the subscription costs have varied since the product’s launch
in February 2020. RedLine Stealer is advertised as accepting
payments in the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin,
Ethereum, Monero, and Tether. Additionally, RedLine Stealer’s
Telegram support channel has continued to provide updates
regarding new features available to Lite and PRO users
throughout 2021. In February 2021, the channel stated that
future builds would be signed by default with Code Signing
digital certificates.

As of this writing, the latest version of RedLine Stealer,
version 21.2, was released on September 3, 2021. alfy1331
stated that the admin panel of the malware was updated and
old RedLine Stealer builds would not work in the updated admin
panel.

Since its initial appearance, RedLine Stealer has continued
to be adopted by top-tier cybercriminals. A thread launched
on June 27, 2021, on the top-tier Russian-speaking forum
Exploit called “Raccoon VS Redline VS Smoke” detailed how
cybercriminals discussed the positives and negatives of various
infostealers that currently operate on the dark web market.
Participants stated that RedLine Stealer has good technical
functionality and provides compromised credentials and other
relevant data as stated in the specs. Also, they stated that one
of the primary advantages of RedLine Stealer is its crypt service,
“Spectrum Crypt Service” @spectrcrypt_bot. For example, the
threat actor “_pra9ma” added that its functionality is similar to
that of AZORult stealer.

Given its positive feedback among cybercriminals, the
source code of RedLine Stealer is sought after by many threat
actors, who are ready to pay a price significantly higher than its
lifetime license cost. On September 17, 2021, the threat actor
“Yorkshire” on Exploit Forum was going to buy RedLine Stealer’s
source code for $2,000.

Role of RedL ine Stealer in Underground Shops
Analysis of the dark web shops involved in the sales of
the stolen account credentials indicates that RedLine Stealer
continues to supply several prominent underground shops,
including Russian Market and Amigos Market, with the largest
number of compromised accounts as of this writing in comparison
to 4 to 5 other stealers often leveraged by its administrators.
Typically, the prices for RedLine Stealer-compromised accounts
are higher than other infostealers. Recently compromised
accounts by RedLine Stealer cost $10.

installed antivirus, the country code, IP address, and other useful
information, which can be seen in Figure 10 below.
Threat actors can access specific logs to gain information
to support further operations. An example, seen below in Figure

can lead to session hijacking and session spoofing, which can
allow an attacker to impersonate the infected user and access

of the data they’ve successfully stolen. The statistics include
the number of wallets, passwords, credit cards, and cookies, as
well as statistics about the top 10 operating systems, antivirus

MALWARE/TOOL PROFILE

Figure 15 highlights the following trends used by the
developer throughout the RedLine Stealer code:
1. The code obfuscates path strings and uses string
replacement functions to determine the real file path,
helping the malware evade static string detection.
2. It uses arrays for strings instead of string variables and
stores strings in reverse order to avoid string detection.
3. Continuous misspellings of words can be found within
the code.
The bulk of the collection can be seen in the module labeled
“ResultFactory”, specifically in the function called directly
from the application’s Program.Execute main function named
“sl9HSDF234”. Interestingly, the names of the functions in
ResultFactory are obfuscated, while all other function names in
the binary are unobfuscated.
RedLine Stealer will terminate its own process and delete
itself from disk in an attempt to remain undetected after
collecting and exfiltrating the stolen data.

RedLine Stealer samples execute various commands that
can be keyed on for detection. Although the PID and the path
of the executable will change depending on the environment
this instance of RedLine Stealer is running in, these commands
and subsequent actions can be used for detection. We have
created a Sigma rule to detect the use of commands and this
rule has been shared on the Recorded Future Platform.
Insikt Group has also created a YARA rule for RedLine
Stealer. The YARA rule is based upon uncommon strings
found in the code as well as the misspellings described in the
RedLine Stealer Analysis section. The YARA rule is available to
Recorded Future clients.

Network-Based Detection
Network detection logic can be developed by making use
of several key elements in the communications between the
RedLine Stealer implant and the command and control (C2)
server:

Since the release of the cracked builder, the original developer
has continued to add functionality to RedLine Stealer. Some
researchers report the addition of more types of crypto wallets
being collected from newer samples including TerraStation,
HarmonyWallet, Coin98Wallet, TonCrystal, and KardiaChain.

• RedLine Stealer communicates using the Microsoft
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which allows
applications to transfer data over HTTP. Tempuri[.]org
is the default domain used by Microsoft development
products including SOAP, and this and other SOAP
artifacts are observed in the RedLine Stealer C2 traffic.
• Specific communications from the server are visible in
the traffic, including commands from the C2 to gather
information. There are some uncommon strings used.

Host-Based Detection

• Specific communications from the infected system are
visible in the traffic, such as system enumeration and
responses to commands. Some uncommon strings are
used.

Figure 17: RedLine Stealer-infected communication displaying SOAP interaction and C2 server instructions (Source: Recorded Future)

RedLine Stealer C2 servers use TCP, but do not use any
specific port. As mentioned in the technical analysis section
above, the port can be set within the RedLine Stealer builder.
RedLine Stealer C2 servers most often are observed using
random, high port numbers such as 11915 or 31858. Benign SOAP
traffic is often on port 80, however, RedLine Stealer C2 servers
have been observed operating on port 80 as well.
Not all of these elements are specific to RedLine Stealer,
and in fact those such as the use of SOAP or port 80/TCP are
quite common in network traffic. But by combining some of
these features, effective detections may be developed. Based
on this data, Snort IDS rules were created using aspects of the
preceding elements these are available on the Recorded Future
Platform.

Active C2 Server Detection
Insikt Group detects active RedLine Stealer C2 servers based
on configuration data extracted from RedLine Stealer samples,
which are then validated by checking for the appropriate
response from the server. C2 servers so identified can be found
in the Recorded Future Platform.
There are also open-source resources available for
organizations to keep informed of RedLine Stealer C2 servers
observed in the wild, such as the ThreatFox compilation of
RedLine Stealer C2 servers provided by Abuse.ch.

MALWARE/TOOL PROFILE

Outlook
RedLine Stealer has become increasingly popular since
its launch in 2020 based on a general increase in reference
count observed among underground sources monitored by
Insikt Group. This increase has been furthered by the influx of
cracked versions of RedLine Stealer distributed across Englishlanguage cybercriminal forums, such as Raid Forums, that are
easily accessible even to actors with less experience with similar
tooling. RedLine Stealer’s role as a secondary payload that
supplements threat activity tied to other popular underground
tooling, such as SmokeLoader, raises the probability that this
stealer will continue to be a reliable method of data harvesting for
the near future. The demand for stolen login information derived
from RedLine Stealer infections for sale within the criminal
underground similarly ensures that shops and marketplaces will
continue to rely on it as a primary source of stolen information to
sell. This continues to be reflected on multiple popular infostealer
shops, such as Russian Market, where RedLine Stealer infections
are associated with the highest volume of infected machines
when compared to other popular infostealers including Vidar and
AZORult.
Several links to cracked versions of RedLine Stealer
distributed within underground sources are no longer active, with
REDGlade likely to have taken steps to prevent old builds of the
infostealer from working with the new admin panel. However,
threat actors who have already downloaded the older, cracked
RedLine Stealer package, which includes a builder and control
panel, can continue using and sharing the malware without any
cost.
Despite the release of a cracked version of the RedLine
Stealer, REDGlade has continued to develop the malware and
now sells a new, updated version. It is expected that both the
“legitimate” and cracked versions of the malware will remain
popular due to the free or minimal cost of this effective infostealer.
We expect that the criminal marketplaces currently selling data
collected by RedLine Stealer will continue doing so as long as the
malware remains an effective means of accomplishing this task.
Since REDGlade continues to update RedLine Stealer with
new functionality and continues to add new features to the
admin panel, detections will need to be verified and updated
accordingly in the future.
