Starting from February 18, this year, the National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity at
the NSDC of Ukraine records massive DDoS attacks on the Ukrainian segment of the
Internet, mainly on the websites of the security and defense sector.
In particular, attacks were carried out on the websites of the Security Service of Ukraine, the
National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, resources of other state institutions and
strategic enterprises. It was revealed that addresses belonging to certain Russian traffic
networks were the source of these coordinated attacks.
During the response and analysis, it was found that the attackers used a new mechanism of
cyberattacks, which had not been observed before in similar incidents.

In such a way, during an

attack, vulnerable government web servers are infected with a virus that covertly makes
them part of a botnet used for DDoS attacks on other resources. At the same time, security
systems of Internet providers identify compromised web servers as a source of attacks and
begin to block their work by automatically blacklisting them. Thus, even after the end of the
DDoS phase, the attacked websites remain inaccessible to users.

The NCCC experts are ready to provide consultations and technical assistance to detect and
respond to this type of cyberattack. In case of detecting the compromised websites, DDoSattacks, please notify the National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity
(report@ncscc.gov.ua) immediately.
