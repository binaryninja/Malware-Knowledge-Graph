Iranian Threat Agent Greenbug has been registering domains similar to those of Israeli High-Tech and

Recent Winnti Infrastructure and Samples

On 15 October 2017 a sample of ISMdoor was submitted to VirusTotal from Iraq. The sample name
was WmiPrv.tmp (f5ef3b060fb476253f9a7638f82940d9) and it had the following PDB string:

C:\Users\Void\Desktop\v 10.0.194\x64\Release\swchost.pdb
Two domains were used for command and control:

thetareysecurityupdate[.]com
securepackupdater[.]com
By pivoting off the registration details and servers data of the two domains we discovered others
registered by the threat agent. Eight contain the name of Israeli high-tech and cyber security companies
and one of a Saudi Arabian testing & commissioning of major electrical equipment company.
We estimate that the domains were registered in order to be used when targeting these companies,
organisations related to them, or unrelated third parties. However, we do not have any indication that the
companies were actually targeted or otherwise impacted.
Below are the malicious domains and the companies who’s names were used.
