San Carlos, CA — Tue, 12 Apr 2022
Check Point Research (CPR), the Threat Intelligence arm of Check Point® Software
Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading provider of cyber security solutions globally
has published its latest Global Threat Index for March 2022. Researchers report that Emotet
is continuing its reign as the most popular malware, impacting 10% of organizations
worldwide, double that of February.
Emotet is an advanced, self-propagating and modular trojan that uses multiple methods for
maintaining persistence and evasion techniques to avoid detection. Since its return in
November last year and the recent news that Trickbot has shut down, Emotet has been
strengthening its position as the most prevalent malware. This was solidified even further this
month as many aggressive email campaigns have been distributing the botnet, including
various Easter-themed phishing scams exploiting the buzz of the festivities. These emails
were sent to victims all over the world with one such example using the subject “Buona
Pasqua, happy easter” yet attached to the email was a malicious XLS file to deliver Emotet.
This month, Agent Tesla, the advanced RAT functioning as a keylogger and information
stealer, is the second most prevalent malware, after appearing fourth in last month’s index.
Agent Tesla’s rise is due to several new mal-spam campaigns delivering the RAT via
malicious xlsx/pdf files worldwide. Some of these campaigns have leveraged the
Russia/Ukraine war to lure victims.
“Technology has advanced in recent years to such a point where cybercriminals are
increasingly having to rely on human trust in order to get through to a corporate network. By
theming their phishing emails around seasonal holidays such as Easter, they are able to
exploit the buzz of the festivities and lure victims into downloading malicious attachments
that contain malware such as Emotet. In the run up to the Easter weekend, we expect to see
more of these scams and urge users to pay close attention, even if the email looks like it’s
from a reputable source. Easter isn’t the only public holiday and cybercriminals will continue
to deploy the same tactics to inflict harm,” said Maya Horowitz, VP of Research at Check
Point Software. “This month we also observed Apache Log4j becoming the number one most
exploited vulnerability again. Even after all the talk about this vulnerability at the end of last
year, it is still causing harm months after the initial detection. Organizations need to take
immediate action to prevent attacks from happening.”

CPR also revealed this month that Education/Research is still the number one most attacked
industry globally, followed by Government/Military and Internet Service Providers/Managed
Service Providers (ISP/MSP). “Web Server Exposed Git Repository Information Disclosure”
is now the second most commonly exploited vulnerability, impacting 26% of organizations
worldwide, while “Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution” takes the top spot, impacting 33%
of organizations. “HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-10826, CVE-202010827, CVE-2020-10828, CVE-2020-13756)” keeps hold of third place with a global impact
of 26%.

Top Malware Families
*The arrows relate to the change in rank compared to the previous month.
This month, Emotet is still the most popular malware with a global impact of 10% of
organizations worldwide, followed by Agent Tesla and XMRig both impacting 2% of
organizations each.
1. ↔ Emotet – Emotet is an advanced, self-propagate, and modular Trojan. Emotet was
once used to employ as a banking Trojan, and recently is used as a distributor to other
malware or malicious campaigns. It uses multiple methods for maintaining persistence
and evasion techniques to avoid detection. In addition, it can be spread through
phishing spam emails containing malicious attachments or links.

3/5

2. ↑ Agent Tesla – Agent Tesla is an advanced RAT functioning as a keylogger and
information stealer, which is capable of monitoring and collecting the victim’s keyboard
input, system keyboard, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating credentials to a variety of
software installed on a victim’s machine (including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and
the Microsoft Outlook email client).
3. ↑ XMRig – XMRig is an open-source CPU mining software used for the mining process
of the Monero cryptocurrency and was first seen in-the-wild May 2017.
Top Attacked Industries Globally
This month Education/Research is the number one most attacked industry globally, followed
by Government/Military and ISP/MSP.

3. ISP/MSP
Top Exploited Vulnerabilities
This month “Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution” is the most commonly exploited
vulnerability, impacting 33% of organizations globally, followed by “Web Server Exposed Git
Repository Information Disclosure” which dropped from first place to second place and
impacts 26% of organizations worldwide. “HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution” is still
in third place in the top exploited vulnerabilities list, with a global impact of 26%.
1. ↑ Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-44228) – A remote code
execution vulnerability exists in Apache Log4j. Successful exploitation of this
vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected
system.
2. ↓ Web Server Exposed Git Repository Information Disclosure – An information
disclosure vulnerability has been reported in Git Repository. Successful exploitation of
this vulnerability could allow an unintentional disclosure of account information.
3. ↔ HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-10826,CVE-202010827,CVE-2020-10828,CVE-2020-13756) – HTTP headers let the client and the
server pass additional information with an HTTP request. A remote attacker may use a
vulnerable HTTP Header to run arbitrary code on the victim machine.
Top Mobile Malware
This month AlienBot is the most prevalent mobile malware, followed by xHelper and FluBot.
1. AlienBot – AlienBot malware family is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) for Android
devices that allows a remote attacker, at a first step, to inject malicious code into
legitimate financial applications. The attacker obtains access to victims’ accounts, and
eventually completely controls their device.

4/5

2. xHelper – A malicious application seen in the wild since March 2019, used for
downloading other malicious apps and display advertisement. The application is
capable of hiding itself from the user and reinstalling itself if uninstalled.
3. FluBot– FluBot is an Android malware distributed via phishing SMS messages
(Smishing), most often impersonating logistics delivery brands. Once the user clicks
the link inside the message, they are redirected to the download of a fake application
containing FluBot. Once installed the malware has various capabilities to harvest
credentials and support the Smishing operation itself, including uploading contact lists,
as well as sending SMS messages to other phone numbers.
