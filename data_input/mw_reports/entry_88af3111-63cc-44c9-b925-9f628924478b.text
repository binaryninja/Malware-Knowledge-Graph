Executive summary
The Gustuff banking trojan is back with new features, months after initially appearing
1/13

targeting financial institutions in Australia. Cisco Talos first reported on Gustuff in April. Soon
after, the actors behind Gustuff started by changing the distribution hosts and later disabled
its command and control (C2) infrastructure. The actor retained control of their malware
since there is a secondary admin channel based on SMS.
The latest version of Gustuff no longer contains hardcoded package names, which
dramatically lowers the static footprint when compared to previous versions. On the
capability side, the addition of a "poor man scripting engine" based on JavaScript provides
the operator with the ability to execute scripts while using its own internal commands backed
by the power of JavaScript language. This is something that is very innovative in the Android
malware space.
The first version of Gustuff that we analyzed was clearly based on Marcher, another banking
trojan that's been active for several years. Now, Gustuff has lost some similarities from
Marcher, displaying changes in its methodology after infection..
Today, Gustuff still relies primarily on malicious SMS messages to infect users, mainly
targeting users in Australia. Although Gustuff has evolved, the best defense remains tokenbased two-factor authentication, such as Cisco Duo, combined with security awareness and
the use of only official app stores.

Campaigns
After Talos' initial report, the Gustuff operators changed their deployment redirections. When
those were blocklisted, the actors eventually disabled the C2, but they never totally stopped
operations. Several samples were still around, but the hardcoded C2 was not available. A
new campaign was detected around June 2019, there were no significant changes the
malware. The campaign was using Instagram, rather than Facebook, to lure users into

2/13

downloading and installing malware.

Domain hits in June
The Instagram-related domains are used for the initial infection, using the exact same
method of operation as before.
But a new campaign spun up at the beginning of this month, this time with an updated
version of the malware. Just like in the previous version, any target that would be of no use
as a potential target is still used to send propagation SMS messages. Each target is
requested to send SMSs at a rate of 300 per hour. Even though the rate will be limited to the
mobile plan of each target, this is an aggressive ask.

Domain hits in October

This method of propagation has a low footprint, since it uses SMS alone, but it doesn't seem
to be particularly effective, given the low number of hits we've seen on the malware-hosting
domains.

Targeted applications
Just as before, this campaign mainly targets Australian banks and digital currency wallets.
This new version seems to target hiring sites' mobile apps.
One of Gustuff's capabilities is the dynamic loading of webviews. It can receive a command
to create a webview targeting specific domains, while fetching the necessary injections from
a remote server.

4/13

Request
Result
During our investigation, we received a command from the C2 to target the Australian
Government Portal that hosts several public services, such as taxes and social security. The
command was issued before the local injections were loaded (using the changearchive
command). The injections were loaded from one of the C2 infrastructure servers. This
command is not part of the standard activation cycle and was not part of the injections
loaded by the version we analyzed in April.
This represents a change for the actor, who now appears to be targeting credentials used on
the official Australian government's web portal.

Technical analysis
This new version of Gustuff seems to be another step in its planned evolution. This malware
is still deployed using the same packer, but
there are several changes in the activity cycle, which take advantage of functionalities which
either where already there or where being prepared. One of the changes in the behaviour is
the state persistency across installations.

ID file
During the activation process, the malware attempts to create a file called "uu.dd" in the
external storage. If the file exists, it will read the UUID value stored inside it that will be used
as an ID for the C2. When this happens, the malware won't go through all the activation

5/13

process. Instead, it will receive commands from the C2 immediately. This file already existed
in previous versions. However, the behaviour described above was never observed.
The main API follows the same philosophy. Gustuff pings the C2 at a predetermined interval,
which will either reply with an "ok" or it will issue the command to be executed.
The targeted applications are no longer hardcoded in the sample. They are now provided to
the malware during the activation cycle using the command "checkApps." This command
already existed on the previous version, but its usage during the activation cycle was not
mandatory.

checkApps Command
The list of anti-virus/anti-malware software that Gustuff blocks as a self-defense mechanism

is now also loaded during the activation cycle.

Example of applications is blocks (not full list)
These changes in the Gustuff activation cycle indicate that the actor decided to lower the
malware static analysis footprint by removing the hard-coded lists. Both commands already
existed in the communication protocol and could have been used in runtime.

Command

Result

During the activation cycle, the malware now asks the user to update their credit card
information. The difference is that it does not immediately show a panel for the user to
provide the information. Instead, it will wait for the user to do it and — leveraging the Android
Accessibility API — will harvest it. This method of luring the victim to give up their credit card
information is less obvious, increasing the chances of success, even if it takes longer.
The communication protocol now has a secondary command execution control. Each
command is issued with a unique ID, which is then used by Gustuff to report on the
command execution state.

Command execution control
8/13

This allows the malicious actor to know exactly in which state the execution is, while before,
it would only know if the command was received and its result. This new control mechanism
also generated the asynchronous command capability. The malware operator can now issue
asynchronous commands that will receive feedback on its execution while performing other
tasks — "uploadAllPhotos" and "uploadFile" commands are two of such commands.
With these changes, the malicious actor is obtaining better control over the malware while
reducing its footprint.
This version of Gustuff has substantial changes in the way it interacts with the device. The
commands related to the socks server/proxy have been removed, as have all code related to
its operation. This functionality allowed the malicious operator to access the device and
perform actions on the device's UI. We believe this is how the malicious actor would perform
its malicious activities. We believe that after collecting the credentials, using the webviews,
the actor would use this connection to interactively perform actions on the banking
applications.
This functionality is now performed using the command "interactive," which will use the
accessibility API to interact with the UI of the banking applications. This method is less
"noisy" on the network, since it takes advantage of the C2 connection, rather than creating
new connections.
The command "script" is also new. This is a very simple command with huge potential.
Gustuff starts a WebChromeClient with JavaScript enabled. Afterward, it adds a JavaScript
interface to the webview, which will allow the execution of methods defined in the malware
code.

9/13

JavaScript scripting
By default, the WebView object already has access to the filesystem, which is not an
additional security risk in this context, allows the operator perform all kinds of scripts to
automate its tasks, especially when the script also has access to commands from the
application.

Conclusion
This is an evolving threat, and the actor behind it seems to want to press on, no matter the
level of coverage this campaign gets. Instead, they changed the malware code to have a
lower detection footprint on static analysis, especially after being unpacked. Although there
are no changes in the way it conducts the campaign, Gustuff still changed the way it uses
the malware to perform its fraudulent activities. The main target continues to be banking and
cryptocurrency wallets. However, based on the apps list and code changes, it is safe to
assume that the actor behind it is looking for other uses of the malware.
