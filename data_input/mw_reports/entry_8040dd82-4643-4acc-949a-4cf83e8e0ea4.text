History

History Lesson Time!
Polaris (better known as MustangPanda)
has been active since 2011.
◆ China-based APT group
◆ Highly interested in antique infection
methods via USB devices (especially post2019) or third-party web hosts.
◆ Previously focused its campaigns on
(South) East Asian territories
◆ Myanmar
◆ Mongolia
◆ Philippines
◆ Japan
◆ …many more
◆

History Lesson Time!
Polaris loves using PlugX and refuses to
abandon it.
◆ Various PlugX variants were developed
over the years
◆

◆

PlugX Fast
◆

◆

PlugDisk
◆

◆

“THOR” variant
PlugX + UDiskShell/USB infection ability

MiniPlug
Miniaturized/rewrite version of PlugX
◆ we’ll get to this one later
◆

History Lesson Time!

So what’s new?
◆

Expanded territory

◆

New tech (but also not really)

◆

Less blatant (but also not really)

Expanded Territory

Previously…
NUMBER OF SAMPLES BETWEEN 2019 TO 2021 BY REGION*

Other, 35, 34%

Asia, 57, 55%

Europe, 12, 11%

* Illustrative purposes only – may not be representative of samples in-the-wild

Now…
NUMBER OF SAMPLES BETWEEN 2019 TO 2022 BY REGION*

Other, 52, 34%

Asia, 72, 47%

Europe, 29, 19%

* Illustrative purposes only – may not be representative of samples in-the-wild

So what happened?
A quick rundown in ten minutes or so...

Another Brief History Lesson
◆

Everything before...
Prepended 10-byte XOR decoding key in blobs
◆ Used simple stack strings to avoid basic
detections
◆

◆

Late 2020
◆

◆

Increased XOR key length

Late 2021
Detected PlugDisk
◆ New payload encoding scheme
◆ Control-flow flattening obfuscation began to
crop up
◆

◆

Custom OLLVM implementation

Earlier stackstring-only command handler

Control-flow flattened command handler

New payload encoding scheme

Another Brief History Lesson
Some time around mid January 2022, a
mysterious sample triggered our detection
system.
◆ State_aid__Commission_approves_
20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greec
e.exe
◆ d404e3cd5f1c6a50f10f56f5c5b9c1e
3
◆ What did the detection flag the sample as?
PlugDisk
◆

Execution flow

Execution flow

Slightly modified payload encoding scheme

But hang on...
Polaris had barely specifically targeted EU
up until this point.
◆ TTPs are wildly different from before.
◆

Different payload encoding scheme
◆ Downloader
◆ Targets EU
◆ Slightly different PlugX behavior
◆

But hang on...
◆

Slightly different PlugX behavior
Much smaller PlugX
◆ Contains fewer command code support
◆ HTTP headers are now almost completely
different from before
◆ Hard to fully disassemble due to the level of
obfuscation
◆

◆

We now refer this variant as MiniPlug due
to the miniaturized nature of it

We kept observing...
◆

Polaris continued to tamper with the
encoding schemes
◆ Single-byte XOR
◆ Single-byte XOR + appended shellcode
◆

We’ll get back to this

Skipping X number of bytes + singlebyte XOR
◆ Mathematical XORs based on filesizes
◆

Use of archive files and obscure file paths.
◆ EU-targeted attacks continue along with
other campaigns and regions featuring
PlugX and other custom malware
◆

We kept observing...
The appended shellcode could be dated
back much earlier on in the operation that
was previously attributed to Polaris back in
2018.
◆ Code reuse -> further attributing the attack
to Polaris
◆

Self-XORing shellcode loader

We kept observing...

◆

Over the last few months, they’ve continued to evolve TTPs by...
Started experimenting with more and more launchers
◆ Started using ISOs as distribution method
◆ Extremely frequent attacks (at least once or twice per month)
◆

Conclusion
◆

Polaris/MustangPanda is continuing to evolve their TTPs
Frequent attacks
◆ Now carry multiple campaigns focusing on a wide variety of targets
◆

EU-related governmental entities <-> MiniPlug
◆ Asia-focused USB spreader/general monitoring <-> PlugDisk / PlugX Fast
◆

◆

◆

Long-time operation

SEA-focused high-profile ops <-> NoFive
◆

Perhaps another day...
