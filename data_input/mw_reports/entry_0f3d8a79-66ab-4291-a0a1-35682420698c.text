Executive Summary
We have observed exploits in the wild for a recently disclosed command injection
vulnerability affecting WebSVN, an open-source web application for browsing source code.
The critical command injection vulnerability was discovered and patched in May 2021. A
proof of concept was released and within a week, on June 26, 2021, attackers exploited the
vulnerability to deploy variants of the Mirai DDoS malware. We strongly recommend that
WebSVN users upgrade to the latest software version.

CVE-2021-32305, and Cortex XDR detects Mirai variants and prevents infection.

Root Cause and Patch Analysis of CVE-2021-32305
Like many source code browsing tools, WebSVN allows users to search through the revision
history to find relevant code changes. These search requests are made by sending a query
to the backend, which is written in PHP.

Figure 1. The user’s input is read from the “search” parameter in search.php.
In versions of WebSVN prior to 2.6.1, the user’s search query is not escaped when it is used
in a shell command. Inside include/svnlook.php the function getListSearch is responsible for
creating the shell command by concatenating the search query with command arguments.

Figure 2. The SVN command is created by concatenating it with the search query.
A function called runCommand inside include/command.php finally executes the command
by passing it to PHP’s proc_open function. The documentation for this function contains the
following warning regarding the command parameter:

Figure 3. PHP documentation.
Without properly escaping the user’s input, it is possible to achieve code execution by
including special characters in the search query. To fix this vulnerability, the code was
changed to sanitize the user input with escapeshellarg before concatenating it to the other
command arguments.

Figure 4. Vulnerability patch.
Another possible solution is to allow proc_open to automatically escape and quote the
command by passing an array of strings as the first argument. This approach might be
considered more concise and easier to maintain. However, it would have required making
bigger changes to the existing code, and it is not compatible with older versions of PHP,
which is likely the reason this solution was not chosen.
proc_open(['svn', 'list', '-R', '--search', $searchstring, '--xml'], ...);

Exploitation in the Wild
2/5

Shortly after CVE-2021-32305 was made public, Unit 42 researchers observed attackers
exploiting it in the wild. One example of an attack is shown here:

Figure 6. HTTP request.
The attacker uses command injection to download a shell script that will infect the system
with malware. When abusing these types of web vulnerabilities, some important details about
the target environment may be unknown to the attacker. These details include the operating
system and processor architecture that the web server is running. The shell script used in the
next step of the attack shows how the attacker can overcome this issue:

Figure 7. Shell script
Malicious Linux binaries are provided for 12 different architectures. Instead of detecting
which one is correct for the target environment, a brute force approach is taken. The script
simply downloads and attempts to execute the binaries for every one of the possible
architectures, disregarding any incompatibility errors. Although WebSVN is a cross-platform
PHP application capable of running on many operating systems, only Linux binaries are used
in this attack.

Malware Analysis
Analysis of this malware reveals that it is used to perform distributed denial of service
(DDoS) attacks and that it shares some of its code with the Mirai botnet family. To reduce the
size of the executable files, each one is compressed with a modified version of the popular
open-source packer, UPX. Because the packer is modified, it is less likely for reverse
engineering tools to succeed in automatically unpacking the executable files, requiring more
manual effort for analysis. Additionally, the malware achieves portability by statically linking
all of its dependencies and making system calls directly inside the code.

3/5

After the malware is executed, it continuously tries to connect to its command and control
(C2) server on port 666. Once it establishes a connection, it communicates using a custom
text-based TCP protocol. It begins by informing the C2 of its architecture, and then it awaits
commands from the operator.

The main purpose of this malware family is to perform DDoS attacks, and the effectiveness
of an attack depends on the network protocols and techniques that are used. In the analyzed
sample, there are eight types of attacks, each designed to be effective against a different
type of target. The following table shows the commands the malware operator can send to
initiate each one.

Conclusion
We observed exploits in the wild for a recently disclosed command injection vulnerability
affecting WebSVN. In one particular attack, the vulnerability is used to deploy DDoS
malware. Attackers will continue to exploit the latest vulnerabilities to expand their army of
