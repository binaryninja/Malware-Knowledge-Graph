An information stealer (or info stealer) is a Trojan that is designed to gather information
from a system. The malware gathers login information, like usernames and passwords
stored on web-browsers, which it sends to another system via email. Another common form
this malware is to log user keystrokes which may reveal sensitive information.

The binary file
Threat name: TroyStealer.exe
MD5: DAB6194F16CEFDB400E3FB6C11A76861
SHA1: C76A9FB1A2AE927BF9C950338BE5B391FED29CD7

At first glance, the info stealer malware is packed (entropy 7.177), and it was compiled on
Thu Jun 11 19:53:24 2020 via a .NET compiler (Microsoft Visual C# v7.0).

Before executing the PE file, some details can be observed such as specific call references
used to decrypt/unpacking the binary and execute another instance in memory via Process
Injection technique.

Figure 4: Smart Assembly 6.9.0.114 – used to obfuscate the binary.
After unpacking it, we observed the binary was also obfuscated in a second-round with .NET
Reactor(4.8-4.9).

In detail, the malware detects if it is running inside a VM and stops the execution. In contrast,
the malware is executed and a new process is created and executed using the process
injection technique. After that, the harvesting process is initiated. Some modules of collecting
details from the browser are started as well as another module to collect mail credentials
from outlook.
In sum, the following steps are performed during the malware execution:
Obtaining victim’s details (credentials info from browser and email)
Getting HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Paltalk passwords
Deleting browser specific files
Getting Security products installed on the device
Obtaining Operating system version
Getting Keystrokes
Sent information via email to the attacker

Filles accessed during the malware execution
C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\profiles.ini

Messaging Subsystem\Profiles\Outlook\9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676

Finally, the malware validates there is a valid Internet connection through a speed test
website. If so, it establishes SMTP communication with the authenticated email server and
sends the victim’s details via email.

Final Thoughts
Malware is nowadays one of the major cyber weapons to destroy a business, market
reputation, and even infect a wide number of users. The next list presents some tips on how
you can prevent a malware infection. It is not a complete list, just a few steps to protect
yourself and your devices.
Get outdated software of your system
Get email savvy; take several minutes looking at the new email and not a few seconds
Beware of fake tech support, emails related do bank transactions, invoices, COVID19,
everything you think be strange
Keep Internet activity relevant
Log out at the end of the day
Only access secured and trusted sites (not only websites with green lock – please
think you are doing, as many phishing campaigns are abusing of free CA to create
valid HTTPS certificates and to distribute malicious campaigns over it)
Keep your operating system up to date
Make sure you are using an antivírus
Beware of malvertising
