BG Hartman,
BLUF: This afternoon, Cyberscoop released an article centered around USCYBERCOM and CNMF's use of
graphics to amplify malware disclosures. The article, while a bit tongue and cheek, is mostly accurate and
does highlight the core purposes of the malware disclosures.

•
•
•

USCYBERCOM imposes costs on adversaries by disclosing their malwa re, to cut off their access and
reinforce defenses
Graphics are used and included to increase engagement and resonate within the Cybersecurity
industry; sources also indicated intent to message adversaries
The graphics may not be shaping adversary behavior but do t ie into USCYBERCOM's Persistent
Engagement strategy to 'bolster arsenal of responses'

Ms. Vavra also reached out to Cyber Command PA for comment and the name of the graphics company.
CYBERCOM did not provide the name of the company but did provide the comment below:

Cyber Command spokesperson said the command "develops visual imagery to engage with the cyber security
community on malware disclosures and vulnerability alerts. We recognize the key role that industry plays in
ensuring global cybersecurity defense against malicious cyber actors, and so we leverage social media best
practices to enhance messaging with i ndustry."

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

How the Pentagon is trolling Russian, Chinese hackers vvith cartoons
Written by Shannon Vavra
"()\" 12. 21)2() [ ( ·y1~I.IZSC( )l) j>
There's little that Russian hackers hate more than being seen as soft. So when U.S.
military hackers saw a way to publicly portray them as bumbling and unthreatening in
recent weeks, they seized the moment.
It all began when Cyber Command, the U.S. Department of Defense's offensive cyber
arm, started working with a graphics company to illustrate foreign government hackers.
The military realized it could punch up the reports it releases on foreign hacking
operations by adding illustrations, and try to embarrass or infuriate the foreign hacking
shops along the way, one U.S. official told CyberScoop.
In one case, when Cyber Command started making plans to expose some statesponsored espionage operations tied to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the
country's KGB successor, they turned to the graphics company to develop images that
would goad the Russians, the official said.
"Russia hates to be seen as cuddly or cozy so we want to tick them off," said the
official, who was not authorized to speak with the press.
The best way to do that, the military hackers decided , was to represent the FSB hackers
as an endearing, if bumbling , bear. (The cybersecurity community has long used names

with references to bears to identify Russian hacking outfits, such as Cozy Bear and
Fancy Bear, the hacking groups behind the 2016 breach of the Democratic National
Committee.)
An implant dropper dubbed #ComRATv4 recently attributed by @CISAgov and @FBI to
Russian sponsored APT, Turla. It was likely used to target ministries of foreign affairs and
national parliament.
@CNMF _CyberAlert continues to disclose #malware samples

USCYBERCOM Cybersecurity Alert (@CNMF _CyberAlert) October 29, 2020

Art that the cybersecurity community uses to portray Russian hackers has typically
shown burly or ferocious bears, but Cyber Command wanted to avoid giving the
Russian hackers an ego boost, the official said.
"We don't want something they can put on T-shirts," the U.S. official said. "We want
something that's in a PowerPoint their boss sees and he loses his shit on them."
The result was an Oct. 29 report that shows a bear tripping over himself and
spilling Halloween candy out of a pumpkin trick-or-treat bucket.
The effort to irritate the hackers is just the newest chapter in a broader Cyber
Command effort to undermine foreign government cyber-operations. Cyber Command
has been publishing samples of malicious software used by foreign hackers in
recent years as part of an initiative aimed at getting the cybersecurity
community to protect against adversaries' malware, thereby making the hacking less
effective. The program is also aimed at sending a warning shot to foreign hackers that
the U.S. government is tracking them.
Historically, this kind of taunting has been a way to boost morale at home, according to
Pablo Breuer, the former director of U.S. Special Operations Command Donovan
Group.
"When you go back to the heyday of information campaigns, go to World War 11, and
you look at the messaging governments did to their own populace, it was either a
positive messaging about yourselves or it was negative messaging against the
adversary," said Breuer, who previously worked at Cyber Command and the National
Security Agency. "I think the silly graphics are more about messaging to the U.S.
government and populace and branding: 'If the adversary is not that good, then Cyber
Command must be really good ."'

Get silly
The first time Cyber Command wanted to share a mocking graphic
about foreign hackers, the contractors had to redraft their sketches because the first
one wasn't silly enough, the U.S. official said. The graphics company's task was to
depict suspected Chinese government's malware, which Cyber Command
called "Slothful Media" for its lazy coding techniques. In the end, when the command
released the novel image, Cyber Command's
Twitter followers reacted with jests and playful comments marveling at the portrayal.
"Our original graphic idea for 'Slothful Media' had to change because we realized it
would be too cool," the official said, in recognition of the fact that the government runs
the risk of unnecessarily inflating the adversary if the graphics are improperly executed.
"Better to mock."
The official declined to share details about what made the original image too "cool," but
the graphics company eventually produced an image of a cartoon-like sloth wearing
headphones and crawling over to a laptop.
A relatively new implant, which we have dubbed #SlothfulMedia, has been used to target
victims in a number of countries, including: India, Kazakhstan. Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Russia
and Ukraine.

The graphics program is just over a month old, during which time Cyber Command only
exposed hacking operations from Russia and China. That means the command has not,
to date, published teasing graphics about hackers from Iran and North Korea, two of the
country's other chief digital adversaries.

Strategic aims
Dan Hoffman, a former chief of station at the CIA, told CyberScoop he thinks the
publication of these graphics may not be overwhelmingly upsetting to Moscow or
Beijing.

"You 're definitely not going to influence the bad guys. They don't care," said Hoffman,
whose tours of duty in the CIA included time in the former Soviet Union. "Maybe they
don't like to be named and shamed but at the end of the day what Vladimir Putin would
do at least is say ... 'You named and shamed us? Ok we're gonna grab a shot of vodka
and go back to work."'
But the graphics tactic could be effective in signaling there may be harsher
consequences down the road , Hoffman added. In recent years Cyber Command has
been working to bolster the arsenal of responses it can use to deter foreign government
hackers. The strategy, known as "persistent engagement," has led Cyber Command to
shut down Russian social media trolls' internet access in one case, and in
another, to send direct messages to Russian government actors to deter them from
running election-related influence campaigns.
"They're talking about persistent engagement and that's what they're doing with the
graphics - they're taking the fight to the enemy and saying if you're going to shoot at
us we're going to go find and shoot you in the face so you can 't shoot at us anymore,"
Hoffman said. "We don't want to go 'cyber nuclear war' with you ... we'll shut you down
at a playful level first with graphics, and we can escalate."
The cost of the cartoonish graphics alone, however, may not be great enough to
change adversary behavior, according to Breuer.
"If Cyber Command is trying to send a message the adversary is trivial, the adversary is
laughing on the way to the bank - because their cyber-operations are still remarkably
successful," said Breuer, who now works at Cognitive Security Collaborative. "What rea l
consequence is there to China and Russia from doing this? Compared to the value our
adversaries are getting from these cyber-operations. they're just going to look at it as
the cost of business."
Even if the graphics don't irk the foreign hackers, Cyber Command hopes they may
prompt antivirus companies to pay more attention to the command 's malware warnings,
the U.S. official said.
"It increases engagement in the community, which gets more attention on the malware,
so worse for the actors. Wins all around ," the official said. "The community here is
[having] fun with it, so that drives engagement on the stuff we want caught, and
theoretically improves detection."
A Cyber Command spokesperson said the command "develops visual imagery to
engage with the cyber security community on malware disclosures and vulnerability
alerts. We recognize the key role that industry plays in ensuring global cybersecurity

defense against malicious cyber actors, and so we leverage social media best practices
to enhance messaging with industry."
