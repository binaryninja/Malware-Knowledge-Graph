The Lazio region in Italy has suffered a reported ransomware attack that has disabled the
region's IT systems, including the COVID-19 vaccination registration portal.
Early Sunday morning, the Lazio region suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted every
file in its data center and disrupted its IT network.
"On the night between Saturday and Sunday the Regione Lazio suffered a first cyber attack
of criminal matrix. We don't know who is responsible and their goals," Nicola Zingaretti, the
President of the Lazio region, said in a statement on Facebook.
"The attack blocked almost every file in the data center. The vaccination campaign
continues as normal for all those who have booked. Vaccine bookings will open for now
suspended in the next few days. The system is currently shut down to allow internal
1/5

verification and to avoid the spread of the virus introduced with the attack."
While ransomware gangs are known to steal data during an attack as leverage in extortion
attempts, the region states that health, financial, and budget data are safe.
The outage has also affected the Salute Lazio health portal used to register for COVID-19
vaccines.
"There is a powerful hacking attack on regional ced. The systems are all disabled including
all of the Salute Lazio portal and the vaccine network. All defense and verification
operations are under way to avoid the misappropriation. Vaccination operations may
experience delays," the region said in a statement.
In June, Italy instituted a new 'Green Pass' certificate system that allows people to prove
that they have been vaccinated, tested negative, or previously had COVID-19.
This green pass will be required for indoor dining at restaurants and bars and be required to
access fitness centers, amusements parks, museums, and other locations with a large
crowd starting on August 6th.
With over 70% of the Lazio population vaccinated and a massive surge in registrations
since the announcement of the Green Pass policy, there is concern that the disruption to
the online COVID-19 vaccination
However, the region states that there has been no disruption to existing appointments for
vaccinations and that the online registration system should be back online in a few days.
"The vaccination campaign won't stop! In yesterday's day, 50 thousand vaccines were
administered, despite the biggest cyber attack suffered," the region stated on Facebook.

Possible RansomEXX ransomware attack
Today, sources have told BleepingComputer that the cyber attack on Lazio was conducted
by a ransomware operation known as RansomEXX.
In a redacted ransom note shared from the attack on Lazio, the threat actors state, "Hello,
Lazio!" and warn the region that their files were encrypted. The ransom note also includes a
link to a private dark web page that Lazio can use to negotiate with the ransomware gang.

Alleged Lazio ransom note
The ransom note does not state what operation conducted the attack but the ONION URL
listed is a known Tor site for the RansomEXX operation.
BleepingComputer also received a screenshot of the negotiation page warning that the
region must pay a ransom to decrypt their files. The threat actors gave no ransom demand.
RansomEXX negotiation pages are unique per victim, and if the threat actors stole data
during the attack, the threat actors provide details on the page, including the amount of data
stolen and screenshots of files.
In this case, the negotiation page showed no indications that RansomEXX stole any data.
Update: After posting our article, Italian security researcher JAMESWT stated that there is
evidence in Italy that the attack was conducted by LockBit 2.0 but could not share further
information.
BleepingComputer will update this article when more information becomes available.

Who is RansomEXX
The RansomEXX gang launched their operation originally under the name Defray in 2018.
However, in June 2020, the operation rebranded as RansomEXX where it began to target
large corporate entities more actively.
Similar to other ransomware operations, RansomEXX will breach a network using
vulnerabilities or stolen credentials.
Once the threat actors gain access to a network, they quietly spread through the network
while stealing unencrypted files for extortion attempts.
After gaining access to the Windows domain controller, they deploy the ransomware on the
network to encrypt all devices.

The RansomEXX gang has a history of high-profile attacks, including Brazil's government
networks, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Konica Minolta, IPG Photonics,
and Ecuador's CNT.
Update 8/3/21: Added information about it possibly being LockBit 2.0.
