Overview

SCADAfence’s Incident Response team assists companies in industrial
cyber security emergencies. In this whitepaper, we will review a recent
incident response activity in which we took part.
This whitepaper has been published with the goal of assisting organizations
to plan for such events and reduce the impact of cyber-criminals on their
networks.
The company that was attacked didn’t have the SCADAfence Platform
deployed at the time of the attack. The SCADAfence Platform was
installed upon the arrival of our Incident Response team as part of the
investigation, and helped them to contain the threat.
The SCADAfence Incident Response team was assisted by the SCADAfence
Reverse Engineering team and by the SCADAfence Research teams, in
order to gain knowledge on the cyber attackers and to contain the attack.

The Ransom Note

Late at night on November
24th, critical services suddenly
stopped working at the largest
manufacturing facility of Umbrella,
Inc.*, an international pharmaceutical
company. An investigation was
immediately launched. While
investigating the issue, the local
IT team found ransom notes on a
number of devices in the network,
requesting the company to contact a
certain email address and to make a
payment in Bitcoin.

02

The IT team immediately called
Mr. Birkin*, the Group IT Leader
who was sleeping soundly. He
immediately woke up and rushed
to the plant, while more and
more devices started showing the
ransom note.
During the 7 hours of the attack,
around 200 critical servers
were encrypted, and the entire
production network was down as
a result.

The company evaluated the
situation and came to the
conclusion that they would
pay the ransom in Bitcoin. But
then the attackers decided to
change their price, which made
the company completely lose
their trust in the cyber criminals,
and they decided not to pay the
ransom to the cyber criminals.

Incident Response Team Is Called On-Site
SCADAfence’s Incident Response (IR) team was then urgently called to the site, which is located in a relatively
remote industrial area. On the way to the site, the SCADAfence IR team was briefed on the situation, and then
provided initial containment instructions to the on-site security team.

Instructions

Incident Response
Goals

The goals of the initial instructions, before
the SCADAfence IR team arrived on-site,
were as follows:

The SCADAfence IR team arrived at the site
and received the following objectives from
Mr. Birkin:

1. Contain the threat to a specific area of the
network and prevent infection of additional
networks.

1. Identify the initial attack vector (how the
attackers got into the network in the
first place).

2. Eliminate or minimize downtime of
unaffected systems, without exposing
them to additional risks.

2. Understand the propagation methods.

3. Keep evidence in an uncontaminated
state. Contaminated evidence hampers an
investigation.

3. Identify all of the machines that are infected.
4. Monitor for any additional suspicious
activity to make sure there are no
backdoors through which the cyber
attackers could gain re-entry.

The IR team was then briefed by the site’s engineers and managers about the situation, and they decided
together on the next steps to achieve those goals.

03

Gathering the Evidence
After the IR team understood the entire situation,
the first step they took was to gather the evidence
as soon as possible. The evidence included images
of the systems, the log files, the configuration files,
and basically anything that might contain information
which could be important for the investigation.
The reason for the urgency is because many
sources of evidence are cyclical, meaning they are

automatically deleted after a while by fresh new data.
Some evidence is saved without historical data (such
as file timestamps), and can become contaminated
with new information if the team waits for too long.
The attackers can attempt to delete evidence (such
as exploits, malware files), and sometimes people
who are trying to be helpful but aren’t experienced
in cyber security can also contaminate or delete
evidence accidentally.

File modification dates are easily contaminated with fresh data, if not investigated immediately

If not investigated immediately, file modification
dates can easily be contaminated with fresh data.
The SCADAfence IR team found out that,
unfortunately, due to a lack of synchronization
between the company’s IT team prior to their
arrival on the site some of the evidence had been
contaminated or lost. For example, some machines

04

SCADAfence © 2020

had been restored from backups without prior
imaging and some logs had been lost because
they weren’t saved in time (prior to the automated
deletion cycle).
Ideally, the IR team should run forensics on all the
machines; but in order to save time, the team needed
to make educated guesses on where to start.

Here is Where the Team Started Looking:
1 Machines that showed signs of infection before others.
2 Machines that were central in many attacks, such as domain controllers.
that showed signs of malicious activity in addition to the ransomware operation – for
3 Machines
example machines that have other attack tools on them. Such information can be gathered from
alerts in the already-installed security mechanisms.

4 Other machines that are suspicious for other reasons.
While on the way, the IR team requested that the
company’s IT team should create images of all the
infected machines, and if impossible (such as in
the case of embedded devices like PLCs/switches,
etc), they should at least gather all of the logs from
the devices. This process should be performed by
someone who is familiar with the type of evidence
that each type of device can offer and who is able to
find the logs that are relevant from a cyber-security

SIEM/SOC

point of view.
On-site, the SCADAfence Platform was installed
on the backbone switch in order to later assist in
detecting and documenting any suspicious activity
going forward. The SCADAfence IR team knew that
the attackers would still have access to the network
and the team wanted to see what the attackers were
doing in the network, and also to recognize any more
infected machines and/or possible access vectors.

The Evidence Analysis

The images have been analyzed by the SCADAfence
forensics team. The SCADAfence forensics team
inspected the configuration of the machines,
the suspicious executables, the log files, the file
timestamps, the event logs, the suspicious files and
everything else that could be relevant. All of the
suspicious executables and binary files were sent to
the SCADAfence Reverse Engineering (RE) team for
further analysis.
The SCADAfence RE team is capable of quickly
understanding any type of attack method and
tools, and has the ability to find IOCs (Indicators
of Compromise) in binaries and executables, such
as C&C (Command & Control) server addresses,
passwords, and other similar valuable information.

The SCADAfence Reverse Engineering
team is capable of quickly
understanding any attack method and
attack tools.
They also have the abilities to find
Indicators of Compromise in binaries
and executables.

The Initial Findings
Several minutes after sending the executable files to
the SCADAfence Reverse Engineering team, it was
discovered that the attackers used a unique malware
sample without any shared IOCs with other malware,
which had prevented it from being detected by
signature-based methods.
The team also found the IP addresses of the new
C&C (Command & Control) servers, together with
the multiple connection methods they support.

07

SCADAfence © 2020

This allowed the SCADAfence IR team to go to the
organizational firewall, filter for those IP addresses
and ports, and get a list of all the infected machines.
The full list included infected machines that the IT
team had not been aware were infected. As a result
of this effort, they started reinstalling or restoring
those machines from backup immediately. Infected
machines can reinfect other machines, so it is critical
to work on them as soon as possible.

Caught Red Handed

A few hours after investigation started, the newly
installed SCADAfence Platform reported a network
scanning activity from one of the machines which
was not on its list of infected machines. This machine
was a server, central to the operation of the network
and had multiple network interfaces (NICs) plus
special firewall rules that allowed it to communicate
with other network segments. The SCADAfence
Platform reported that this server was scanning
segments that were not infected, over ports 445
TCP (SMB) and 3389 TCP (RDP). The scanning activity
was not visible in the firewall logs because some of
the networks had been bridged using NICs installed
on the machine rather than by being routed through
the firewall.

08

SCADAfence © 2020

The customer was unaware of such configurations,
and assumed that all cross-segment traffic was
routed through the firewall.
As a result of the scanning event, the SCADAfence
IR team understood that the attackers were looking
for additional segments to infect, and they decided
to shut down all machines that have multiple
NICs, as at least one NIC had been shared with the
infected segment. This was a high price for the
customer to pay, but it was the SCADAfence IR team’s
recommendation because it was the only way to limit
the attack surface. On this newly infected machine,
additional attack tools were discovered, such as the
network scanner that was used by the attackers.

Closing the Loop
This machine was managed by an external contractor for the purpose of maintenance and support. It had
an external IP address, which prevented the IR team from finding it in the firewall logs (these were filtered
on connections from inside to the outside). It had internet connectivity open to only one IP – the IP of a
machine that was managed by the external contractor. The machine’s event log showed an RDP connection
from the external machine approximately 1 hour before the attack had begun.
With the guidance of the vendor, the SCADAfence IR team connected to the external machine and
reviewed its logs:
Here is what they discovered:

1 It had an RDP port open to the internet.
2 It was unpatched.
3 It had no endpoint protection software.
4 Windows Defender was disabled.
5 It had a “twin” log event of connecting to the internal machine at the same time.

These pieces of evidence confirmed that the origin of the attack was the external
server, which had been left unpatched and was exposed to the internet and
maintained by a vendor with little awareness of cyber security.
The entire investigation took the SCADAfence IR team about 10 hours.

Additional Attack Methods Used
by the Cyber Attackers
In addition to the main attack methods, which were an RDP vulnerability, a C&C server and a ransomware
executable, the cyber attackers also used additional attack methods that were discovered in the SCADAfence
Platform such as:
1. Patching the hosts file to prevent access to the VirusTotal malware analysis service.
2. Disabling Windows updates.
3. Hiding executables in legitimate folders.
4. Locking any input devices during the encryption process.
5. Disabling the endpoint protection software.
6. Using Mimikatz to successfully extract and use Domain Admin Kerberos tickets.

Further Analysis
The attackers may have generated additional backdoors into the network, so continuing monitoring with the
SCADAfence Platform is crucial to ensure that the whole network does not become reinfected.
In addition to that, the SCADAfence Platform has:

1 Detected multiple, high-risk policy violations, after configuring the company’s security policy in the
SCADAfence Governance portal.

2 Mapped all external to internal and internal to external access points.
Mapped the connectivity between network segments, including legacy and hidden

3 connections that were unknown to the customer.

4 Detected additional wormable vulnerabilities in both the industrial and IT equipment, that should
be patched or contained.

5 Detected additional security events over the course of the weeks following the attack.
These findings allowed
the IT team to prevent
similar future attacks
from happening again,
thereby reducing risk
exposure.

Conclusions and Next Steps
The SCADAfence Research team has compiled a list
of steps that could have prevented the cyber-attack
or could have seriously limited the attack’s impact:
1 A network monitoring system with a firewall
integration, like the SCADAfence Platform,
could have prevented the attack. When cyber
attackers are scanning the network, the network
monitoring system could have automatically
isolated the device, disconnecting it from the
internet and sending it to the IT team for further
review. This would have ended the incident
before the machine started infecting any other
machines.
2. A proactive approach would have been much
more cost-effective to execute, as opposed to
being attacked and handling the cyber-attack
incident later on. The proactive approach allows
security teams to know in advance if they have
any policy violations, or if they have any network
or device vulnerabilities, and they can perform

prioritization. A machine that is open to the
internet, and is also a part of a large subnet with
critical servers, is easy to detect and would have
been prioritized as a critical finding by a network
monitoring platform such as the SCADAfence
Platform.
3. Have off-site backups of important systems and
test restoration procedures from time to time.
Have at least 1-2 older backup points, for example
from 90 and 180 days ago (if your storage allows
it). Otherwise, the IT teams might be restoring a
backup from last week that’s still infected with
malware. Restoring from an infected backup can
severely prolong the restoration time.
4. The SCADAfence IR team reviewed all of
the Domain Admin accounts along with the
customer and helped them change all of their
passwords. The IR team also reviewed all
Kerberos related configurations and reset the
KRBTGT password.

5. Kerberos tickets must timeout as recommended
by Microsoft – 600 minutes or less.
6. All externally facing services should be microsegmented. Access to, and from them should be
restricted.
7. A secure remote connectivity solution must be
put in place, such a solution is available by using
SCADAfence and CyberArk.
8. All remote connections should include 2-factor
authentication.
9. Network segments must be put in place in a way
that traffic between them is limited to specific
services only, and not “any -> any” rules. They
should be defined in a way in which an infection of

an entire segment won’t halt the operation of the
entire network. Therefore, it’s not recommended
to use one segment for all of the critical servers.
Some servers, such as Domain Controllers, should
have their own segment.
10. All machines that require internet connectivity
should be configured to use a central server in the
DMZ instead of talking directly to IP addresses.
11. Machines that are required to browse the
internet (host->any rule), should not be able to
directly communicate with industrial devices or
vulnerable devices.
12. Start a software vulnerability management
process (if you don’t already have one).

A proactive approach would have been much more cost-effective to execute,
as opposed to getting attacked and later handling the cyber-attack

Don’t Be Scared, Be Prepared
This organization did not wait for a cyber-attack
to start their cyber security program. They were in
touch with other security companies prior to the
attack. However, they weren’t fast enough and the
vulnerabilities were critical enough for attackers to
gain access into the network and to cause damage.
A well-prepared network is:
1. Very difficult to attack.
2. Slows down the attackers, and allows the
defenders to take action.
3. Still attacked occasionally, but the damage
caused is minimal.
For example, in this specific network there were
around 5,000 devices, but only 200 servers
were attacked. The reason for this is a network
segmentation solution that they had in place.
Otherwise, they would now be recovering from a
5,000 devices ransomware attack.
