The McAfee mobile research team has found a new type of Android malware for the MoqHao
phishing campaign (a.k.a. XLoader and Roaming Mantis) targeting Korean and Japanese
users. A series of attack campaigns are still active, mainly targeting Japanese users. The
new spyware has very different payloads from the existing MoqHao samples. However, we
found evidence of a connection between the distribution method used for the existing
campaign and this new spyware. All the spyware we found this time pretends to be security

applications targeting users in Japan and Korea. We discovered a phishing page related to
DNS Hijacking attack, designed to trick the user into installing the new spyware, distributed
on the Google Play store.

Fake Japanese Security Apps Distributed on Google Play
We found two fake Japanese security applications. The package names are com.jshop.test
and com.jptest.tools2019. These packages were distributed on the Google Play store. The
number of downloads of these applications was very low. Fortunately, the spyware apps had
been immediately removed from the Google Play store, so we acquired the malicious bullets
thanks to the Google Android Security team.

This Japanese spyware has four command and control functions. Below is the server
command list used with this spyware. The spyware attempts to collect device information like
IMEI and phone number and steal SMS/MMS messages on the device. These malicious
commands are sent from a push service of Tencent Push Notification Service.

command name
We believe that the cybercriminal included minimal spyware features to bypass Google’s
security checks to distribute the spyware on the Google Play store, perhaps with the
intention of adding additional functionality in future updates, once approved.

Fake Korean Police Apps
Following further investigation, we found other very similar samples to the above fake
Japanese security applications, this time targeting Korean users. A fake Korean police
application disguised itself as an anti-spyware application. It was distributed with a filename
of cyber.apk on a host server in Taiwan (that host has previously been associated with
malicious phishing domains impersonating famous Japanese companies). It used the official
icon of the Korean police application and a package name containing ‘kpo’, along with
references to com.kpo.scan and com.kpo.help, all of which relate to the Korean police.

The Trojanized package was obfuscated by the Tencent packer to hide its malicious spyware
payload. Unlike the existing samples used in the MoqHao campaign, where the C&C server
address was simply embedded in the spyware application; MoqHao samples hide and
access the control server address via Twitter accounts.

The malware has very similar spyware functionality to the fake Japanese security
application. However, this one features many additional commands compared to the
Japanese one. Interestingly, the Tencent Push Service is used to issue commands to the
infected user.

the command name
There are several interesting functions implemented in this spyware. To execute an
automated phone call function on a default calling application, KAutoService class has an
implementation to check content in the active window and automatically click the start call
button.

Another interesting function attempts to disable anti-spam call applications (e.g. whowho –
Caller ID & Block), which warns users if it is suspicious in the case of incoming calls from an
unknown number. The disable function of these call security applications in the spyware
allows cyber criminals to make a call without arousing suspicion as no alert is issued from
the anti-spam call apps, thus increasing the success of social engineering.

Connection with Active MoqHao Campaigns
The malware characteristics and structures are very different from the existing MoqHao
samples. We give special thanks to @ZeroCERT and @ninoseki, without who we could not
have identified the connection to the active MoqHao attack and DNS hijacking campaigns.

conditions.

There is a strong correlation between both the fake Japanese and Korean applications we
found this time. This malware has common spy commands and shares the same crash
report key on a cloud service. Therefore, we concluded that both pieces of spyware are
connected to the ongoing MoqHao campaigns.

Conclusion
We believe that the spyware aims to masquerade as a security application and perform spy
activities, such as tracking device location and eavesdropping on call conversations. It is
distributed via an official application store that many users trust. The attack campaign is still
ongoing, and it now features a new Android spyware that has been created by the
cybercriminals. McAfee is working with Japanese law enforcement agencies to help with the
takedown of the attack campaign. To protect your privacy and keep your data from cyberattacks, please do not install apps from outside of official application stores. Keep firmware
up to date on your device and make sure to protect it from malicious apps by installing
security software on it.
McAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/SpyAgent and alerts mobile users if it
is present, while protecting them from any data loss. For more information about McAfee
