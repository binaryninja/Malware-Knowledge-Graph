The U.S. regularly hacks foreign governmental computer systems on a
massive scale.

As the news about Russia’s broad digital espionage operation against the U.S. Defense,
Treasury, and Commerce Departments, nuclear laboratories, and other governmental
systems grows more ominous, prominent voices are calling for a vigorous response. “[A]ll
elements of national power,” including military power, “must be placed on the table,”
proclaimed Thomas Bossert, the former senior cybersecurity adviser in the Trump
administration, in a New York Times op-ed. The United States must “reserve [its] right to
unilateral self-defense,” and “allies must be rallied to the cause” since such coalitions will be
“important to punishing Russia and navigating this crisis without uncontrolled escalation.”
Sen. Richard Durbin had a similar but pithier assessment: “This is virtually a declaration of
war by Russia on the United States.”

The lack of self-awareness in these and similar reactions to the Russia breach is
astounding. The U.S. government has no principled basis to complain about the Russia
hack, much less retaliate for it with military means, since the U.S. government hacks foreign
government networks on a huge scale every day. Indeed, a military response to the Russian
hack would violate international law. The United States does have options, but none are
terribly attractive.
The news reports have emphasized that the Russian operation thus far appears to be purely
one of espionage—entering systems quietly, lurking around, and exfiltrating information of
interest. Peacetime government-to-government espionage is as old as the international
system and is today widely practiced, especially via electronic surveillance. It can cause
enormous damage to national security, as the Russian hack surely does. But it does not
violate international law or norms.
As the revelations from leaks of information from Edward Snowden made plain, the United
States regularly penetrates foreign governmental computer systems on a massive scale,
often (as in the Russia hack) with the unwitting assistance of the private sector, for purposes
of spying. It is almost certainly the world’s leader in this practice, probably by a lot. The
Snowden documents suggested as much, as does the NSA’s probable budget. In 2016, after
noting “problems with cyber intrusions from Russia,” Obama boasted that the United States
has “more capacity than anybody … offensively.”
Because of its own practices, the U.S. government has traditionally accepted the legitimacy
of foreign governmental electronic spying in U.S. government networks. After the notorious
Chinese hack of the Office of Personnel Management database, then-Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper said: “You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did. If
we had the opportunity to do that, I don't think we'd hesitate for a minute.” The same Russian
agency that appears to have carried out the hack revealed this week also hacked into
unclassified emails in the White House and Defense and State Departments in 2014-2015.
The Obama administration deemed it traditional espionage and did not retaliate. “It was
information collection, which is what nation states—including the United States—do,” said
Obama administration cybersecurity coordinator Michael Daniel this week.
Some argue that it is time to end this accepting attitude. This seems to be President-elect
Joe Biden’s view. “A good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our
adversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first place,” he said yesterday.
But this is much easier said than done, even beyond the hypocrisy in punishing others for
doing to us what we do to them. The main lawful options—economic sanctions, criminally
charging and trying to arrest those involved, recruiting adversary hackers, and the like—have
been tried for years in related contexts, and failed to stop the digital carnage. Anything more
than these rather modest retaliatory steps threatens an escalatory response by the Russians
that might leave the United States—deeply dependent on weakly defended digital networks
—in a more vulnerable position. This in a nutshell is why the Obama administration was so
paralyzed in responding to various cyber intrusions.

The Trump administration overcame these worries and asserted a more aggressive posture
that is called “Defend Forward.” The basic idea is that U.S. Cyber Command will maintain a
persistent presence in adversary governmental networks so that it can “confront our
adversaries from where they launch cyber attacks,” as NSA Director Paul Nakasone put it.
Defend Forward was deemed a success in preventing interference in the 2018 and 2020
elections. But it utterly failed to even detect the recent Russia hack. It is not hard to see why.
Even Cyber Command has limited resources. It cannot monitor, detect and prevent all
possible major cyber threats.
But there are other problems with Defend Forward as a potential response to the Russia
hack. It requires the United States to do the very thing it is trying in part to prevent—massive
spying inside government networks. And it requires an additional and more controversial
step beyond mere espionage: disruption of the adversary system to stop the attack before it
succeeds. In 2018, this involved shutting down the Russian Internet Research Agency’s
internet access.
This additional step is legally much more contestable than mere espionage. And more
importantly, now that the United States has widely touted this practice, nothing in principle
prevents other countries from engaging in analogous disruptions in our systems following
extended espionage. Some worry that the Russian presence in U.S. networks “might allow
them to conduct destructive attacks or change data inside government systems.” But this is
very much like what Defend Forward purports to do in order to prevent attacks on the United
States.
The United States has spent “billions of dollars to assemble the world’s most potent arsenal
of cyberweapons and plant them in networks around the world,” as the New York Times
reported last year. It also reported that that as part of Defend Forward, the United States had
deployed “potentially crippling malware” inside the Russian electric grid and other Russian
computer systems, “at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried
before,” in order to warn and deter the Russians for meddling in our computer systems. This
effort at deterrence appears not to have worked, but it highlights the dangers of Defend
Forward. The United States and Russia have been involved in escalating tit-for-tat cyber
operations against one another for a long time. Perhaps this year’s Russians hack is in part a
responsive “defend forward” operation to warn and deter the United States from further
action. It is hard to know where we are in the retaliatory cycle, but it is pretty clear that the
United States has more to lose from escalating retaliation.
The larger context here is that for many reasons—the Snowden revelations, the infamous
digital attack on Iranian centrifuges (and other warlike uses of digital weapons), the U.S.
“internet freedom” program (which subsidizes tools to circumvent constraints in authoritarian
networks), Defend Forward, and more—the United States is widely viewed abroad as the
most fearsome global cyber bully. From our adversaries’ perspective, the United States uses
its prodigious digital tools, short of war, to achieve whatever advantage it can, and so
adversaries feel justified in doing whatever they can as well, often with fewer scruples. We

can tell ourselves that our digital exploits in foreign governmental systems serve good ends,
and that our adversaries’ exploits in our systems do not, and often that is true. But this moral
judgment, and the norms we push around it, have had no apparent influence in tamping
down our adversaries’ harmful attacks on our networks—especially since the U.S. approach
to norms has been to give up nothing that it wants to do in the digital realm, but at the same
time to try to cajole, coerce, or shame our adversaries into not engaging in digital practices
that harm the United States.
Despite many tens of billions of dollars spent on cyber defense and deterrence and Defend
Forward prevention, and despite one new strategy after another, the United States has failed
miserably for decades in protecting its public and private digital networks. What it apparently
has not done is to ask itself, in a serious way, how its aggressive digital practices abroad
invite and justify digital attacks and infiltrations by our adversaries, and whether those
practices are worth the costs. Relatedly, it has not seriously considered the traditional third
option when defense and deterrence fail in the face of a foreign threat: mutual restraint,
whereby the United States agrees to curb certain activities in foreign networks in exchange
for forbearance by our adversaries in our networks. There are many serious hurdles to
making such cooperation work, including precise agreement on each side’s restraint, and
verification. But given our deep digital dependency and the persistent failure of defense and
deterrence to protect our digital systems, cooperation is at least worth exploring.
