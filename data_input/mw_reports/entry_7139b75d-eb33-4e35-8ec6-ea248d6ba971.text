On the 27th of August, we have found evidence that an IoT device in one of our customer
environments had accessed a malicious software sample. We have investigated the sample
and discovered that a Gafgyt fork has been updated and it is now being distributed with two
new Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) modules to launch attacks against targeted
machines.
Mirai and Gafgyt have been the go-to IoT malware for many years now in cybercrime circles:
their versions have successfully infected millions of vulnerable IoT devices over the years.
Since their source code have been released publicly, many threat actors use the Mirai or

2/16

Gafgyt code as a malware-skeleton and then retrofit it with their unique improvements,
creating their own special version of the botnet.
In this short threat alert, we will detail the most important findings related to this new
malicious campaign.

Overview of the New Mirai/Gafgyt Fork
Two interesting entries in our logs started the investigation. Previously, we have not
observed the name “Korpze” as a campaign tag. The set of numbers at the end of the
filename suggests a random keyboard typing with a reference to the l33t internet-slang with
“1337”.

Technical Details
All of the investigated malware samples had retained their debug information and symbols,
their binaries had not been stripped, which is, as we have observed, standard with these
campaigns, as malware operators do not pay much attention to operational security.

Lack of stripping usually observed in immature campaigns

Origins of the New Botnet
There are two references in the binary to YakuzaBotnet and Scarface, the developer of a
Mirai variant:
YakuzaBotnet
Scarface1337Self Rep Fucking NeTiS and Thisity 0n Ur FuCkInG FoReHeAd We BiG
L33T HaxErS
It suggests that the base of this variant was most likely taken from Yakuza botnet, a Mirai
variant leaked to the public:

How the Botnet Gains an Initial Foothold
The function telnet_scanner_init is in charge of setting the initial foothold in vulnerable
devices. It scans randomly generated IPs and tries to log in with a list of pre-defined,
hardcoded credentials on port 23 (Telnet).
These leaked credentials are the default credentials of many poorly secured IoT devices.
Users are strongly advised to change these passwords once they purchase the
following appliances:

Important Functions in this Mirai/Gafgyt Fork
The following table lists all attack modules that were present in the investigated sample.
Besides the Telnet dictionary attack module, it uses many different DoS modules. Most of
these have already been investigated by other researchers, but the last two modules are
quite new:

Attacks_vector modules
This is the first time these modules have been observed in Gafgyt variants. The name of the
first one suggests a module to DoS OpenVPN servers. The name choice for the second one
is curious, as it is the name of a famous modding tool for PC games like Skyrim.
However, the two functions work similarly by building the UDP header via
build_udp_header and then connecting to the target via socket_connect_raw_udp, and
launching the UDP flood.

The wabbajack function uses socket_connect_icmp to launch an ICMP flood at the target.

Similar Naming to PBot Modules

6/16

Recently, CN-CERT has released an article on a new, emerging P2P botnet called PBot.
PBot consists of 6 interesting DDoS modules that have similar goals to the two DDoS
modules we have observed in the Korpze campaign.
attacks_vector_game_killer
attacks_vector_nfo_v6
attacks_vector_plainudp
attacks_vector_plaintcp
attacks_vector_l7_ghp
attacks_vector_ovh_l7
Interestingly, neither PBot, nor the Korpze variant uses each other’s DDoS modules, but their
naming convention is the same. Most likely these DDoS modules are now disseminated in
cybercrime forums, and it is up to the malware developers, which ones they include in their
own campaigns.
The less likely assumption is that PBot and this Korpze campaign are related as they share
DDoS modules from the same attack corpus, but we cannot really attribute based on a poor
string match.

Updating nameservers
There is a specific function called UpdateNameSrvs to change nameservers on the infected
device. The function is responsible for writing the file /etc/resolv.conf with Google’s DNS
servers.
void UpdateNameSrvs() {
uint16_t fhandler = open("/etc/resolv.conf", O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC);
if (access("/etc/resolv.conf", F_OK) != -1) {
const char* resd = "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n";
size_t resl = strlen(resd);
write(fhandler, resd, resl);
} else { return; }
close(fhandler);
}

This is most likely to aid malware operators: the developer likely wanted to circumvent any
DNS servers that block malicious IPs from reaching users, as Google’s 8.8.8.8 DNS does no
block malicious IPs:
“Google Public DNS rarely performs blocking or filtering, though it may if we believe
this is necessary to protect our users from security threats.”
https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/intro

User-Agents Used in HTTP DoS Attacks
7/16

There are 60 hardcoded User-Agents included in the sample, which are used in the DoS
module ovhl7, SendHTTP, and SendHTTPCloudflare. Once the DoS module is launched at
a target, the function randomly chooses a User-Agents to attack with.

SendHTTPCloudflare DoS module uses randomized User-Agents

This mechanism is in place for evading security countermeasures: victims cannot simply
block the attack by denying a single specific User-Agent.
Here’s a small excerpt of User-Agents used:
FAST-WebCrawler/3.6 (atw-crawler at fast dot no; http://fast.no/support/crawler.asp)
TheSuBot/0.2 (www.thesubot.de)
Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16

New Campaigns Appearing
Just as we were investigating the Command-and-Control server, we have observed a new
campaign being switched on and all malicious binaries being exchanged with a new set of
binaries for various architectures.

A new campaign just launched with a new set of malicious binaries

This new campaign goes by the tag-name daddyl33t as it is revealed by its supposed
creator.

Daddyl33t, the creator

The campaigns are short lived for many reasons:
The campaign operator might want to hold on to the surprise element as long as
possible: traditional antivirus engines do not usually detect the samples on release, as
they need some time to build up detection.
A compromised Command-and-Control server could be under siege from many
different threat actors: as they fight to keep their own ground, new players could come
in by exploiting vulnerable servers and overwrite the malicious binaries with their own
campaign, distributing a different set of binaries from that point on.
Also, as new source codes are released on cybercrime or other underground forums,
campaign operators adjust and update their malicious tools whenever there is a better
malware version with more or better features.
10/16

Creating a flavor of Mirai/Gafgyt has never been so easy. The leaked source codes of
Mirai and Gafgyt/QBot are all over GitHub and other repositories, and implementing
new functions, removing unnecessary features, and adjusting malicious tools with
recent exploits (as new vulnerabilities are discovered) is widely practiced by scriptkiddies.
