Big Game Hunting TTPs Continue to Shift After DarkSide

CrowdStrike Intelligence Team

September 14, 2021

The eCrime ecosystem is an active and diverse economy of financially motivated threat
actors engaging in a myriad of criminal activities to generate revenue. With the CrowdStrike
eCrime Index (ECX), CrowdStrike’s Intelligence team maintains a composite score to track
changes to this ecosystem. The ECX is composed of several key observables covering
different aspects of criminal activity that are combined using a mathematical model. In recent
weeks, the Intelligence team observed a notable shift in big game hunting (BGH) activity and
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that resulted in a downward trend of the ECX. As
noted in a previous CrowdStrike Intelligence blog, the intense attention surrounding the
Colonial Pipeline and JBS incidents had a significant impact on the criminal marketplace and
the political landscape. Get more Intel updates on the latest eCrime activity and TTPs at

ECX Suggests Downward Trend in Ransomware Operations
Following Colonial Pipeline Attack

1/5

By the time of the Colonial Pipeline attack on May 7, 2021, observed BGH ransomware
incidents had reached a yearly high. However, publicly observable BGH activity declined
throughout early June 2021, immediately after the incident, amid reports of mounting U.S.
pressure to pursue BGH actors. A similar decline was also observed in the number of
specific leaks posted to adversaries’ dedicated leak sites (DLS). Despite the decline in the
ECX, there has been sustained ransomware activity, likely indicating that a number of
adversaries are remaining active despite the dismantling of other groups.

BGH Actor Developments
BGH adversaries responded to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident and the resulting
widespread media coverage in many ways. Some named actors shuttered ransomware-asa-service (RaaS) affiliate programs — at least publicly — while others have continued
deploying ransomware.
CARBON SPIDER (operators of DarkSide ransomware) continues to create active
command-and-control (C2) servers to deploy their Domenus PS backdoor and Cobalt Strike
post-exploitation framework. The activation of new C2 servers demonstrates that CARBON
SPIDER has not halted activities despite allegedly losing control of DarkSide-related
infrastructure and having their ransomware funds seized by the U.S. government.1 However,
in late July 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a new ransomware called BlackMatter
being distributed. Code overlaps indicate that BlackMatter is highly likely the successor of
CARBON SPIDER’s DarkSide ransomware. CARBON SPIDER has also created a Linux
version of BlackMatter that resembles the Linux version of DarkSide in multiple ways. After

taking a short break, CARBON SPIDER reinstated their BGH operations involving this RaaS
and have stated that they have an interest in purchasing and executing unauthorized access
to corporate networks.
RIDDLE SPIDER (operators of Avaddon ransomware) closed down their operations in late
June. Earlier in June 2021, media sources allegedly received emails containing a password
and links to 7zip files containing Avaddon ransomware decryption keys.2 RIDDLE SPIDER’s
DLS also went offline in June. While CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot confirm RIDDLE
SPIDER’s motivations for closing down the Avaddon RaaS, the decision was likely
influenced by the Colonial Pipeline incident and its resulting effects throughout the
ransomware industry.
GRACEFUL SPIDER had several members of their group arrested on June 16, 2021, by a
joint international law enforcement operation.3 These members were involved in laundering
cryptocurrency funds acquired through the use of GRACEFUL SPIDER’s Clop ransomware.
The immediate impact to GRACEFUL SPIDER operations resulting from these arrests is
currently unclear. GRACEFUL SPIDER’s DLS site remains active after the arrests, with two
new listings in June, indicating they have not ceased their activity.
PINCHY SPIDER (developers and operators of the popular REvil RaaS) continued operating
at a high pace throughout June and early July 2021, and the group introduced a new
ransomware named REvix, which is used to target ESXi and Linux environments. However,
on the morning of July 13, 2021, PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil infrastructure supporting their DLS
and payment portal went offline. On the same day, the forum administrator of the Russianlanguage criminal forum XSS banned the actor Unknown (aka UNKN), who has acted as the
public spokesperson for PINCHY SPIDER since 2019. PINCHY SPIDER had released REvil
version 2.08 a few days prior, confirming the ransomware was under active development,
and version 1.2 of REvix was observed on July 23.
On Sept. 7, after an approximately three month hiatus, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed
PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil infrastructure come back online. Financial activity in terms of BTC
transactions from previously identified REvil addresses was also detected on Sept. 5.
On June 4, a sample of INDRIK SPIDER’s Hades ransomware was identified using the name
PAYLOADBIN, similar to Babuk Locker’s DLS site Payload.bin. INDRIK SPIDER likely
switched the names in an effort to avoid attribution by law enforcement and therefore avoid
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. Prior to this recent name change,
INDRIK SPIDER attempted to change the names of Hades and their Phoenix CryptoLocker
ransomware at least one other time to avoid OFAC sanctions. The changes made to avoid
these sanctions indicates that INDRIK SPIDER desires to continue their deployment of
ransomware.

In July 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence determined that Grief ransomware is developed by
DOPPEL SPIDER, likely as an intended successor to DoppelPaymer ransomware. The
cessation in DoppelPaymer activity coincided with the emergence of the Grief DLS that was
first observed in May. Analysis of recently identified Grief samples indicates a number of
technical overlaps with DOPPEL SPIDER’s wider toolset that provides a definitive link to the
adversary.
WIZARD SPIDER continues to actively deploy Conti ransomware and update the Conti DLS.
In June 2021, WIZARD SPIDER continued to target large entities in Europe and the United
States, including organizations in real estate, education and local government. Recent
developments related to the Colonial Pipeline and JBS incidents have not slowed down
WIZARD SPIDER’s ransomware operations. This indicates WIZARD SPIDER remains
largely unaffected by external pressure, similar to their response to the September 2020
takedown efforts targeting TrickBot infrastructure.

Outlook
The confluence of U.S. and international law enforcement pressure and forum bans on
ransomware activity has led to a highly fluid and chaotic situation in the eCrime ecosystem.
The ECX has indicated a change in BGH activity May through June 2021 as well as the
persistence of ongoing BGH incidents at a level observed in the first quarter of 2021.
However, the downward trend in BGH victims posted to DLSs in June likely indicates that
some BGH actors have shifted TTPs to make tracking their activity more difficult.
Numerous adversaries have shown themselves keen to take advantage of the situation and
to attract new affiliates. These adversaries have explicitly expressed their intent to continue
ransomware operations despite reports of possible U.S.-Russian collaboration — or more
aggressive unilateral enforcement actions by the U.S. — in response to incidents, suggesting
that a complete drop in BGH activity is highly unlikely to occur in the near future.
The ECX remains a valuable tool used to identify significant events affecting the eCrime
ecosystem. The ECX provides an easily referenced index to mark areas of disruption or
change in the eCrime ecosystem in real time.
Monitor the ECX regularly in the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to make sure you stay upto-date on eCrime trends.
