Indian conglomerate Indiabulls Group has allegedly been hit with a cyberattack from the
CLOP Ransomware operators who have leaked screenshots of stolen data.
The Indiabulls Group is an Indian conglomerate with $3.5 billion in revenue (2019), over
19,000 employees, and subsidiaries focusing on housing, personal finance and lending,
infrastructure, and pharmaceuticals.
"The Indiabulls Group is a diversified financial services group with interests in housing
finance, consumer finance and personal wealth. The Group also has a presence in Real
Estate, Pharmaceuticals, Lighting and Infrastructure & Construction Equipment Leasing. The
group has a net worth of more than ₹ 28,580 Cr. (as on 31st March, 2019)," states their
about page.

CLOP Ransomware claims to have breached Indiabulls
The CLOP Ransomware operators claimed to have breached Indiabulls and have posted
screenshots of files that they have allegedly stolen during the attack.

When performing a ransomware attack, the CLOP threat actors are known to steal
unencrypted files before deploying the ransomware.
These files are then posted on their 'CL0P^_- LEAKS' data leak site with a threat that more
data will be leaked if the ransom demand is not paid.
Today, the CLOP threat actors have uploaded screenshots of six stolen files with the
message of "Contact us in 24H."
The leaked documents include a voucher, a letter, and four spreadsheets related to
the Indiabulls Pharmaceuticals and Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited subsidiaries.

Indiabulls leak on CLOP data leak site
It is not known how much CLOP is demanding for a ransom or when the attack occurred.
Cyberintelligence firm Bad Packets told BleepingComputer, though, that Indiabulls has an
Citrix Netscaler ADC VPN gateway exposed, which is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-19781
vulnerability.
It is not known if this is how they were potentially breached.

Threat intel firm Bad Packets said that its internet-wide scans had discovered last year that
the fintech company had run unpatched servers for a long time, leaving its systems exposed
to attacks.
In March, the CLOP Ransomware operators also conducted an attack against U.S
pharmaceutical company ExecuPharm when they stole 163GB of unencrypted files. Since
then, the ransomware actors have leaked it all on their data leak site after not being paid.
BleepingComputer has contacted both CLOP and Indiabulls but has not received a response
as of yet.
