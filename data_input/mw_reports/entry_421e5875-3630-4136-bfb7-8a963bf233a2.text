A new campaign spreading the Adwind RAT has been seen in the wild, speciﬁcally targeting the
petroleum industry in the US. The samples are relatively new and implement multi-layer
obfuscation to try to evade detection. We found multiple RAT samples hosted on the serving
domain and spread across multiple directories, all hosted within the last month. We have
previously reported the use of this RAT targeting the retail and hospitality industry.
The overall functionality of the RAT has remained the same as our previous post: It achieves
persistence through registry modiﬁcations, performs process injection to stay under the radar,
terminates security services (e.g., ﬁrewall, AV), and steals sensitive data. The major change is in
the obfuscation technique, wherein multiple embedded JAR archives are used before unpacking
the actual payload. Netskope Threat Protection detects the malware as ByteCodeJAVA.Trojan.Kryptik and Gen:Variant.Application.Agentus.1. This blog post provides an analysis
of the new campaign and the new obfuscation techniques.

Responsible Disclosure
The URLs hosting the Adwind RAT were reported to Westnet on September 9th, 2019.

New Adwind Campaign targets US Petroleum Industry - Netskope

We discovered the new campaign serving the Adwind RAT JAR payload from
“members[.]westnet[.]com[.]au/~joeven/”. Westnet is an Australian ISP. The attacker is either a
Westnet user or has compromised the account of one or more Westnet users. The same RAT is
being hosted by multiple other Westnet users. Some of the recent uploads have multiple ﬁle
extensions (*.png.jar.jar) to hide the actual ﬁle-type visibility from the target user. We have listed
some of the current upload directories in the Indicators of compromise section. At the time of
writing, the links were still active.
When the victim executes the payload, there are multiple levels of JAR extractions that occur.
Figure 1 below summarizes the execution stages at a high level.

Step 1
The dropped JAR payload executes and creates the parent java process and copies itself into the
%User% directory. Once the copy is created, the java thread performs the following three actions:
Executes the copy
Creates a registry entry in HKCU/CurrentVersion/Run to maintain persistence.
Creates WMI scripts in %temp% and launches them. These scripts, shown in Figure 2,
disable ﬁrewall and antivirus services.

Step 2
The new JAR dropped in Step 1:
Performs AES decryption routine on an embedded object to construct the Step 3 JAR
Writes the Step 3 JAR in the %temp% directory and executes it as a new java thread.
Figure 3 below shows the decompiled class ﬁles implementing the decryption routine on an object
named “_”.

Step 3
The Step 3 JAR loads the JRAT class.

Step 4
This JRAT class is responsible for loading and linking the DLL which contains the major RAT
functionality. It then tries connecting to its command and control server at 185[.]205[.]210[.]48.
The JRAT class contains multiple levels of obfuscations within itself in order to hide its features
and functionality.
When we last blogged about it, the RAT was cross-platform and supported Windows, Linux, and
Mac. Figure 4 below shows the OS check implemented by JRAT, indicating that the crossplatform support hasn’t changed.

The core functionalities of the RAT is shown in Figure 4 below. Some of the highlight features
include:
Capturing webcam images
Scanning the hard-drive for ﬁles based on extensions deﬁned in RAT’s conﬁg.
Spinning up multiple process threads and performing injection into known legitimate
windows processes.
Monitoring system status.
Encrypting and exﬁltrating the data to its command and control server.

Conclusion
The Adwind RAT is a well-known malware family that has actively been used in multiple
campaigns over the last couple of years. The samples we analyzed showed that the VirusTotal
detection ratio for the top-level JAR was 5/56 while that of the ﬁnal decrypted JAR was 49/58.
These detection ratios indicate that attackers have largely been successful in developing new,
innovative obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
