Summary
Tick is a cyberespionage group primarily targeting organizations in Japan and the Republic of
Korea. The group is known to conduct attack campaigns with various custom malware such as
Minzen, Datper, Nioupale (aka Daserf), and HomamDownloader. Unit 42 last wrote about the Tick
group in July 2017.
Recently, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 discovered the Tick group targeted a speciﬁc type of secure
USB drive created by a South Korean defense company. The USB drive and its management
system have various features to follow security guidelines in South Korea.
The weaponization of a secure USB drive is an uncommon attack technique and likely done in an
effort to spread to air-gapped systems, which are systems that do not connect to the public
internet. In addition, our research shows that the malware used in these attacks will only try to
infect systems running Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. This is despite the fact
that the malware appears to have been created when newer versions of Windows software were
available. This would seem to indicate an intentional targeting of older, out-of-support versions of

Tick Group Weaponized Secure USB Drives to Target Air-Gapped Critical Systems

Microsoft Windows installed on systems with no internet connectivity. Air-gapped systems are
common practice in many countries for government, military, and defense contractors, as well as
other industry verticals.
We have not identiﬁed any public reporting on this attack, and we suspect the Tick group used the
malware described in this report in attacks multiple years ago. Based on the data collected, we do
not believe this malware is part of any active threat campaign.
Our picture of this past attack is incomplete at this time. Based on our research thus far, we are
able to sketch out the following hypothesized attack scenario:
1. The Tick Group somehow compromised a secure type of USB drive and loaded a malicious
ﬁle onto an unknown number of them. These USB drives are supposed to be certiﬁed as
secure by the South Korean ITSCC (English).
2. The Tick Group created a speciﬁc malware we are calling SymonLoader that somehow gets
on older Windows systems and continuously looks for these speciﬁc USB drives.
3. SymonLoader speciﬁcally targets Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems ONLY.
4. If SymonLoader detects the presence of a speciﬁc type of secure USB drive, it will attempt
to load the unknown malicious ﬁle using APIs that directly access the ﬁle system.
In the research below, we outline our ﬁndings around SymonLoader. We do not currently have
either a compromised USB drive nor the unknown malicious ﬁle we believe is implanted on these
devices. Because of this we are unable to describe the full attack sequence.
Because we do not have either a compromised USB drive or the unknown malicious ﬁle, we are
also unable to determine how these USB drives have been compromised. Speciﬁcally, we do not
know if there has been a successful compromise in the supply-chain making these devices, or if
these have been compromised post-manufacturing and distributed using other means such as
social engineering.
Tick and Trojanized Legitimate Software
Unit 42 hasn’t identiﬁed the initial delivery method; the overview of the infection process is shown
below in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Infection process
First, the attacker tricks users with a Trojanized version of legitimate software to install the loader
program, which is a new tool to Tick we’ve named “SymonLoader”.
When executed, the loader starts monitoring storage device changes on a compromised
machine. If SymonLoader detects the targeted type of secure USB drive, it attempts to access the
storage through the device driver corresponding to the secure USB and checks for strings speciﬁc
to one type of secure USB in the drive information ﬁelds. Then, it accesses a predeﬁned location
of the storage on the USB and extracts an unknown PE ﬁle.
As we described in a previous blog last July, the Tick group Trojanized a legitimate program and
embedded malware called HomamDownloader. The attackers then sent the Trojanized legitimate
applications as attachments to spear phishing email targets. When executed, the Trojanized
legitimate application drops HomamDownloader and installs the legitimate program. Recipients
may not be aware of the malware as the legitimate application works as expected.
In our research into these latest attacks, we found additional legitimate Trojanized Korean
language software since publishing out blog last year (Table 1). Similar to the previous samples
we examined in July 2017, these newly Trojanized legitimate programs also drop
HomamDownloader. Also like we saw in our July 2017 research, HomamDownloader can install
other malicious ﬁles from the remote C2 server; in this case, pre.englandprevail[.]com.

Table 1 Trojanized Korean programs
During our investigation, we found an interesting sample on January 21, 2018 (Table 2). Similar to
the samples listed above, this sample is a Trojanized version of a legitimate program and drops
malware. In this case, the Trojanized application is a Japanese language GO game. Instead of
installing HomamDownloader like we observed in July 2017, this Trojanized program installs a
new loader we’ve named SymonLoader.
SymonLoader extracts a hidden executable ﬁle from a speciﬁc type of secure USB drive and
executes it on the compromised system. Unfortunately, we do not have a copy of this ﬁle.

Table 2 Trojanized Japanese language program
Despite the differences from previous samples, we believe this sample is related to the Tick group
because the shellcode in the Trojanized Japanese game is exactly the same as that found in the
Trojanized Korean programs described earlier. Also, SymonLoader shares code with
HomamDownloader (Figure 2). The Tick group is known to develop and consistently update
custom tools. As such, code reuse like this is consistent with their development practices.

Secure USB
SymonLoader ﬁrst checks the operating system version of the target host and if it is newer than
Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, it stops working. According to the timedate stamp in the
PE header, the malware was created on 26 September 2012. Both Windows 7 and Windows
Server 2008 were already released by then if the timedate value is not modiﬁed.

After checking the OS version, SymonLoader creates a hidden window named “device monitor”
that starts monitoring storage device changes on the compromised system. When a removable
drive is connected the malware checks the drive letter and drive type. If the drive letter is not A or
B, and the drive type is not a CDROM the malware calls CreateFile API and gets a handle to the
storage device. By excluding drives A and B (typically used for ﬂoppy drives) and CDROM drive
types, it appears likely that the malware is targeting removable USB drives.
Next, the malware calls the DeviceIoControl() function with an undocumented custom control
code, 0xE2000010 (Figure 3). The control code consists of four different types of values;
DeviceType, Function, Access, and Method. In this case, the DeviceType value is 0xE200
computed as: (0x0E2000010 & 0xffff0000)>>0x10. According to Microsoft, this speciﬁc
DeviceType value should be in the range for third-party vendors. To function properly, the thirdparty driver needs to be present on the compromised system before the malware calls
DeviceIoControl() with the custom control code 0xE2000010. But which third-party driver? There
is a clue in the next function.

Figure 3 DeviceIoControl with custom IoControlCode
SymonLoader gets device information by SCSI INQUIRY command using the
IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH parameter and determines if it is the targeted drive by searching
for a speciﬁc string in the Vendor or Product identiﬁcation on INQUIRY data. Our research into the
string used in these searches showed a company in the South Korea Defense Industry whose
name matched the string. This company develops information and communication security
equipment used by military, police, government agencies and public institutions. In a press, this
company announced that they make secure USB storage devices that are certiﬁed to meet
security requirements set out by South Korea’s IT Security Certiﬁcation Center (ITSCC (English)).
In South Korea, certain organizations are required to follow the “USB storage medium guideline”
and using only the devices passed the audit by the government agency. For example, the
guideline of the Ministry of Uniﬁcation of South Korea deﬁnes the USB memory and management
system introduction procedure at section 4, item 1 (Figure 4).

“According to ‘Guidelines for Security Management of Auxiliary Storage Media such as USB
Memory’, the headquarters security ofﬁcer shall request the National Intelligence Service to verify
the security compliance to introduce USB memory.”
We found the third-party device driver in question in the installer of the secure USB drive in a
public sample repository, and conﬁrmed it supports the custom control code, 0xE2000010. The
driver provides some functions to applications, including access to the corresponding secure USB
volumes. We feel this evidence shows that the malware attempts to work only on the secure USB
product made by this particular company.
Loading Hidden Module
If SymonLoader ﬁnds it is on a Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 system and ﬁnds that a
newly attached device is a USB drive made by this particular company, then it will extract an
unknown executable ﬁle from the USB. While we do not have this ﬁle, we can glean information
about it by analyzing SymonLoader and the third-party driver. The attacker encrypted the
unknown executable ﬁle and concealed it at the ending part of the secure USB storage in
advance. The hidden data is not accessible through logical ﬁle operation APIs, such as
ReadFile(). Instead, SymonLoader uses Logical Block Addressing(LBA) and SCSI commands to
read the data physically from the particular expected location on the removable drive.
LBA is a simple linear addressing scheme. Storage is divided into blocks by ﬁxed size, and each
block has a number starting from zero to N-1, depends on the volume size. Applications can
specify the block number and access the data by SCSI commands.
Finally, SymonLoader saves the extracted ﬁle in the temporary directory on the local disk and
executes it. The procedure is as follows:
1. Obtains ﬁnal Logical Block Address(LBA) of the storage “N-1” by using the READ
CAPACITY (10) command.
2. Read the third last block “N-3” by READ (10) command and decrypts it.
3. From the decrypted data, gets the LBA “X” where the main module locates.
4. Loads data from LBA “X” to “N-4” by READ (10) command and decrypts it.
5. Saves the decrypted ﬁle as %Temp%\[random characters].tmp and execute it.
6. Writes hostname and local time of the compromised system at LBA “N-2” by SAVE (10)
command.
Figure 5 shows the data layout of the malicious storage from the perspective of Logical Block
Addressing.

Conclusion
The Tick group uses Trojanized legitimate applications to trick victims into installing ﬁrst stage
malware, mostly HomamDownloader. In this research, we identiﬁed a previously unknown loader
malware being dropped instead of HomamDownloader, which was most likely used in attacks
multiple years ago. In contrast to HomamLoader, which requires an Internet connection to reach
its C2 server to download additional payloads, SymonLoader attempts to extract and install an
unknown hidden payload from a speciﬁc type of secure USB drive when it’s plugged into a
compromised system. This technique is uncommon and hardly reported among other attacks in
the wild.
While we do not have a copy of the ﬁle hidden on the secure USB, we have more than enough
information to determine it is more than likely malicious. Weaponizing a secure USB drive is an
uncommon technique and likely done in an effort to compromise air-gapped systems, which are
systems that do not connect to the public internet. Some industries or organizations are known for
introducing air gapping for security reasons. In addition, outdated versions Operating Systems are
often used in those environments because of no easy-update solutions without internet
connectivity. When users are not able to connect to external servers, they tend to rely on physical
storage devices, particularly USB drives, for data exchange. The SymonLoader and secure USB
drive discussed in this blog may ﬁt for this circumstance.
