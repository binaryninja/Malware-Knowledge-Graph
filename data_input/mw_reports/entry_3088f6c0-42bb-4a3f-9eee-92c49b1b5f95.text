Yesterday, Yan Zhu, a security engineer for the privacy-focused Brave web browser,
tweeted about a domain impersonating Brave that was promoted through Google ads.
The domain was bravė.com . Note the accent on the e, which distinguishes it from
brave.com , the domain it was impersonating.
This is an example of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), a domain name that
includes non-ASCII characters. Such domains have an ASCII representation that starts with
xn-- and use punycode to convert from ASCII to unicode and vice versa. The ASCII
representation of the impersonating domain is xn--brav-yva.com .

When IDNs are used to impersonate existing domains, one speaks of a homograph or
homoglyph attack. Other than the use of accents on Latin characters, this also includes
using similar-looking characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as using the Greek α
instead of the Latin a. Though not incredibly common in practice, such attacks do exist and
security researchers have warned about them for more than a decade.
The bravė.com or xn--brav-yva.com domain was registered through NameCheap in
June and is hosted at 185.198.166.104 , which belongs to ITLDC, a Bulgarian cloud
provider with servers in a number of countries.
My first thought was to use the Silent Push app to see what else is hosted there.

I found three more domain names, all IDNs: xn--ldgr-xvaj.com , xn--sgnal-m3a.com
and xn--teleram-ncb.com . The unicode representations of these domains are
lędgėr.com , sīgnal.com and teleģram.com respectively, presumably impersonating
cryptocurrency wallet maker Ledger and messaging apps Signal and Telegram. (I say
‘presumably’ because signal.com and telegram.com aren’t actually linked to the
respective messaging apps.)
These other three domains were also registered at NameCheap. Using our passive DNS, I
found that none of the domains had been seen at another IP address, so I couldn’t pivot
any further.
However, I wondered if this actor could have hosted other domains at a different server.
Assuming they’d also use the same registrar and hosting provider, I ran a search query in
Silent Push’s API for domains starting with xn-- using NameCheap’s name servers and
hosted on ITLDC’s ASN (AS21100).
I found nine further domains. Two of them ( xn--80aaw7ah.com and xn-80ahcmbumt.org ) represent words in the Cyrillic alphabet and there is no reason to
assume they are used for anything malicious.
The other seven, however, were all hosted on the same IP address ( 195.245.113.25 )
and all impersonate legitimate products, including once again Brave and Telegram:

The fake installer on bravė.com that prompted this research was an ISO file that appears
to contain a version of the Redline infostealer. That suggests it may be related to a
campaign analysed by Morphisec last month, where Redline was also served packed inside
an ISO through malicious Google ads, impersonating Telegram and other services. The
domain names involved in that campaign were also registered through NameCheap.
As for IDNs, there are tools that help one find homograph attacks on an existing domain
name. However, it is through a comprehensive and easily searchable passive DNS
database that one can find a bigger picture of the campaign using a homograph attack.
