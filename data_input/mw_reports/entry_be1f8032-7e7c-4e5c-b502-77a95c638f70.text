September 8, 2021 | By Cipher Tech ACCE Team

Summary
Cipher Tech analysts monitoring VirusTotal for BlackMatter ransomware activity discovered new
variants of BlackMatter malware self-reporting as versions 1.9 and 2.0. The new BlackMatter malware samples contain
additional functionality, changes to the configuration data, and version 2.0 additionally introduces changes to the configuration
decryption algorithm. Cipher Tech analysts developed an ACCE module to automate the extraction of BlackMatter malware’s
configuration data. Cipher Tech’s analysis reveals new variants of BlackMatter malware and a refinement in BlackMatter’s
tactics, techniques, and procedures.

Who is BlackMatter
BlackMatter is a ransomware affiliate program actively attacking victims that was first identified in July
2021 by RecordedFuture and a security researcher pancak3. BlackMatter claims to derive from the now inactive REvil
and DarkSide ransomware affiliate programs. Supporting BlackMatter’s claim, a joint code correlation effort
between BleepingComputer and Emsisoft suggests that BlackMatter malware’s’ encryption routines contain strong similarities
to DarkSide malware samples.
BlackMatter claims to target companies in the US, UK, Canada, or Australia with between 500 – 15,000 hosts and revenues of
at least 100K. BlackMatter claims they will not target the following industries and will provide free decryption services
to BlackMatter victims in these industries.
Hospitals
Critical infrastructure facilities
Oil and gas industry
Defense industry
Non-profit companies
Government sector

Background
Cipher Tech analysts leveraged ACCE to discover, decrypt, and parse configuration data from BlackMatter ransomware
samples with reported version numbers of 1.9 and 2.0. Cipher Tech has not identified detailed public reporting for samples with
a version number above 1.2. This suggests either a fast development cycle or a refinement in TTPs with respect to versioning.

1/9

Cipher Tech’s ACCE software enables the automated extraction of configuration data from supported malware samples. ACCE
indicated that parsing the 1.9 and 2.0 samples configuration data differed from the expected format of
ACCE’s existing BlackMatter configuration parser. Based on the change in configuration, Cipher
Analysts examined both samples to identify differences between BlackMatter’s 1.2 ransomware sample,
BlackMatter’s 1.9 ransomware sample, and BlackMatter’s 2.0 ransomware sample.
Analysis of the BlackMatter 1.9 sample and its configuration data revealed that BlackMatter added additional capabilities to
BlackMatter 1.9. BlackMatter 1.9 contains the following new functionality:
Print ransom notes to a locally installed computer
Check the hostname of a compromised system prior to installation
Additional verification checks to ensure BlackMatter does not encrypt their own ransom note
Provide additional details and evidence of stolen information within the ransom note
Further analysis of the BlackMatter 2.0 sample, reported by @sisoma2 on Twitter, and its configuration data revealed that
BlackMatter uses all the changes indicated for 1.9 above, and changed the decryption algorithm for the configuration data and
some encrypted strings. BlackMatter 2.0 uses the following decryption methodology:
A 64-bit seed/key for configuration and string decryption
A modified MMIX-LCG pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm for generating the key used to decrypt each
8-byte block of the encrypted configuration data / string.
A byte-swap algorithm for adjusting the generated MMIX-LCG state value into an XOR key for decrypting each 8-byte
block.

Samples Compared
This post will demonstrate these changes in BlackMatter Versions 1.9 and 2.0 in comparison to a BlackMatter Version 1.2
sample. For the purposes of the analysis presented below:
Version 1.2 reflects the BlackMatter Ransomware with MD5 598c53bfef81e489375f09792e487f1a, compiled 2021-0723T20:51:18+00:00
Version 1.9 reflects the BlackMatter Ransomware with MD5 f1c260c31b9d3f9ff54a142d508ec602, compiled 2021-0812T22:22:01+00:00
Version 2.0 reflects the BlackMatter Ransomware with MD5 38035325b785329e3f618b2a0b90eb75, compiled 2021-0816T07:13:07+00:00

Configuration Decryption
The encrypted configuration data structure for 1.9 remains the same as previously documented by Group-IB, the data is
stored in the .rsrc PE section, although there are no actual resources, the following Python construct documents the layout:

Figure 1: Version 1.9 Encrypted Configuration Structure
The encrypted configuration data structure for 2.0, however, is modified to account for the change in decryption algorithm. The
following Python structure defines the change, where the seed is now 8 bytes instead of 4:

Algorithm Changes

2/9

The decryption algorithm in Versions 1.2 and 1.9 used an XOR algorithm where the key for each 4-byte block was generated
using a modified Delphi/Pascal-LCG PRNG. The standard Delphi/Pascal-LCG masks each round to generate a floating point
number in the range 0-1, where the modified algorithm masks each round using the following, where “seed” is the initial seed
value reflected in Figure 1:

Figure 3: Version 1.9 Delphi/Pascal-LCG Mask
Version 2.0 uses a modified MMIX-LCG algorithm for key generation, where the standard parameters are represented in
Figure 4 and the BlackMatter parameters are represented in Figure 5. Additionally, in the standard MMIX-LCG the value is not
masked, and in BlackMatter the value is masked as seen in Figure 6, where “seed” is the initial seed value reflected in Figure
2.

Figure 6: BlackMatter MMIX-LCG Mask
In addition to the LCG-PRNG algorithm changes, 2.0 decrypts in 8-byte blocks (previously 4-byte blocks) and conducts a byteswap on the MMIX-LCG generated value each round before using it as an XOR key for the 8-byte block. For each MMIX-LCG
generated value, the following byte-swap is performed:

Figure 7: Version 2.0 Byte-Swap
Following decryption, there are no additional changes in the procedure, and configuration data is aPLib decompressed in all
versions (1.2, 1.9, and 2.0) and parsed.
Configuration Parsing
The decrypted and decompressed configuration data yields several differences, as described below. There were no changes
in the configuration data from 1.9 to 2.0, so all differences will reflect a comparison between 1.2 and 1.9.
Difference 1: Configuration Flag – Print Ransom Note

Figure 8: Version 1.2/1.9 Configuration Flag Parsing
The first noticeable difference is in the number of parsed flags. In Version 1.2 on the left, 8 flags are parsed, while in Version
1.9 on the right, 9 flags are parsed.

3/9

Figure 9: Version 1.2/1.9 Configuration Structure
The additional flag is described above for Version 1.9 on the right as print_ransom, which is noticeably absent from Version 1.2
on the left. If the print_ransom field is set, during runtime the BlackMatter ransomware will invoke the method below, which
calls the dynamically resolved API GetDefaultPrinterW (which is not resolved in Version 1.2) and if the default printer is not a
“PDF” printer, it will print the ransom note to that printer.

Difference 2: Configuration Parameter – Invalid Hostnames

4/9

Figure 11: Version 1.9 Configuration Structure
The second configuration difference is in the inclusion of invalid hostname hashes, displayed in the structure above. The
hostnames are leveraged in the “safe mode” function, as described by Sophos. The difference from Version 1.2 to Version 1.9
is the inclusion of a function which checks if the compromised system is an invalid host.

Figure 12: Version 1.2/1.9 Safe Install Function
As displayed in the screenshot below, the comparison is achieved by hashing and comparing the hostname to the list of invalid
hostname hashes, using the ROR-13-ADD hash algorithm (lowercase string, include null terminator).

5/9

Figure 13: Version 1.9 Invalid Host Name Check
The Version 1.9 analyzed sample was not configured with any invalid hostname hashes, however, it can be surmised that the
malware authors are attempting to avoid running in Sandboxes or other Virtual Analysis Environments.
Difference 3: Configuration Parameter – Ransom Note Hash

Figure 14: Version 1.2/1.9 Configuration Structure
The final configuration difference is the inclusion of the ransom note hash, using the ROR-13-ADD hash algorithm (include null
terminator, use seed of -1).

6/9

Figure 15: Version 1.2/1.9 Verify Not Ransom Note Function
In Version 1.2 on the left, we can observe that the BlackMatter ransomware will verify the input file is the same size as the
ransom note, and that the filename hash (ROR-13-ADD hash algorithm (lowercase string, include null terminator, use seed of
-1)) is the same as the previously calculated value. On the right, Version 1.9 contains the same checks, but additionally hashes
the file data to compare against the configured hash value.
Ransom notes have been observed in varying sizes, with some containing extra information in comparison to others, so the
purpose of this change is unknown.
Difference 4: Ransom Note

The ransom note obtained from Version 1.9 contains significantly more content than the one obtained from Version 1.2. The
additional content includes details of the type of information stolen from the victim and print.sc links which presumably provide
evidence that the information has been stolen. print.sc is a screenshot sharing service associated with
the LightShot screenshot application.
