Introduction
• This talk focuses on the methodology of long term threat
actor monitoring
• Examples are based on a Trend Micro investigation published
on February 18, 2020
Operation DRBControl - Uncovering a Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Gambling
Companies in Southeast Asia

• Goals:
• Establish Tactics, Technics and Procedures (TTP) of a threat actor
• Help incident response/detection
• Get as much context as possible

Introduction
• Investigation started on July 2019, after Talent-Jump
technologies brought interesting samples to us
• The samples were found in a gambling company in
Philippines

• No obvious link to a known threat actor

Malware analysis and
classification

Malware analysis and classification
• Goals:
• Extract IOCs (domain names, IP addresses, file names, registry keys…)
• List the malware features
• Find the malware family, if known

• How:
• Pick your favorite disassembler
• Classification: Yara, TLSH, search
engines…

Malware analysis and classification
• Initial triaging result:
• 4 different families, of which 3 are unknown
• Only known family was found in October 2019

• Let’s focus on “Type 1” malware, but the methodology is the
same for other families

Malware analysis and classification
• Malware is packed and uses DLL side-loading

Decrypt

MsMpEng.exe
Legitimate Microsoft file

Mpsvc.dll
Malicious DLL

Mpsvc.mui
Encrypted payload

Malware analysis and classification
• Malware is written using C++, it support plugins, class names
can be extracted from RTTI information and are selfexplanatory

Pivoting from samples

Pivoting from samples
• “Easy” pivoting : unique strings
•
•
•
•

Query on search engine (sandbox results)
“content” modifier on VirusTotal or similar malware repositories
Yara rules for more complex queries
RetroHunt for past malwares

 Fail, malware is packed

13

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Pivoting from samples
• Algorithm for network communication encryption uses a
substitution table of 256 bytes
• 256 bytes hardcoded in a specific order
• Yara rule written, alerting added and RetroHunt launched
 New samples found, all relevant

14

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Pivoting from samples
• On March 23th, an alert matching this substitution table is
raised
• The related sample is not a malware
 The Yara rule is prone to false positives

15

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Pivoting from samples
• We found source code posted on February 27, 2015 on
CodeProject.com matching the assembly code

 Don’t discard possibility of code reuse, even with few
matching samples
16

Pivoting from samples
• Metadata in different file formats is also useful
• VERSIONINFO structure from the PE format contains information on
filename, description, version, etc
• Documents contain metadata (title, author name, …)

• In this particular investigation, we could find several related
samples by leveraging metadata
• 2 malware samples had “HaoZipUpdate” as original filename
• 4 malicious documents had “Dell_20170514745” as author

17

Pivoting from samples
• Legitimate HaoZipUpdate was patched

18

Pivoting from samples
• Mutexes might be used for correlation
• SFX archive dropping Trochilus malware named “diskshawin.exe”
uses mutexes with unique names (“cc5d64b344700e403e2sse”,
“cc5d6b4700e403e2sse” and “cc5d6b4700032eSS”)
• A BbsRAT sample named “diskwinshadow.exe” found in a public
sandbox report also uses these mutexes
• That BbsRAT sample has “bot.googlerenewals.net” as C&C, which is
listed in a report from ClearSky on Winnti threat actor

Pivoting from infrastructure

Pivoting from infrastructure
• Passive DNS : database of historical links between IP
addresses and domain names
• Some threat actors reuse their servers or domain names for
multiple campaigns
• Needs to be handled with caution, it is prone to false
positives and false negatives

21

Pivoting from infrastructure
• IP addresses history for domain name
update.mircosoftdefender.com as seen on PassiveTotal

Pivoting from infrastructure
• Truncated list of domain names history for IP address
43.228.126.172 as seen on PassiveTotal

23

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Pivoting from infrastructure
• Some threat actors register their domain names in bulk
 Creation Date timestamp for those domains is close
• mircosoftdefender.com created on 2018-08-09 at 08:40:27
• By filtering on registrar and name server, we find 3 additional
domains created on same date between 08:40 and 08:41
• dinohonevice.com
• luxespiremag.com
• googleusermessage.com
24

Pivoting from infrastructure
• Many more techniques
• TLS certificate tracking
• Correlation through metadata (web server version, hosting provider,
HTTP headers …)
• Search of domain names/IP addresses on public sandboxes results
• HTTP static content tracking

25

Pivoting
• All those techniques needs to be reiterated when new IOCs
are found

IP address

Telemetry and further links
27

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Telemetry
• As an AV, we have telemetry from our customers (if enabled)

• Spear-phishing emails sent on May 2019
• Different company, also in South-East Asia
• Also in gambling/betting industry

 Confirmation of the targeted industry and location

28

Links with known threat actors
• Links with Winnti
• Shared mutexes, which means probably code sharing for a dropper
• We noticed a binary being downloaded from an IP address by the
threat actor: Passive DNS for that IP address showed domains related
to Winnti

• Links with EmissaryPanda/LuckyMouse
• We found a sample from the HyperBro family, which is used
exclusively by this threat actor

Using malware features to
our advantage
30

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Using malware features to our advantage
• Type 1 malware has a secondary C&C channel
Send commands

Standard C&C channel
Uploads computer info in own dir
Looks for “bin.asc” file in own dir and loads it

31

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Puts “bin.asc” file
in chosen dir

Using malware features to our advantage
• To read and write to the repository, the malware uses a
hardcoded API key

32

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Using malware features to our advantage
• “bin.asc” is a new malware family using Dropbox as C&C
(analysis is available in our paper)
• 142 different directories, of which 129 contain a “bin.asc” file
• ~50 post-exploitation tools found in the repository

Using malware features to our advantage

34

Using malware features to our advantage
• On March 2020, we noticed a new campaign using Type 1
malware family
• After extracting Dropbox API key, we noticed permissions
had been modified
• Token was not allowed to list directories
 Threat actor reacted to our publication

Conclusion
36

© 2020 Trend Micro Inc.

Conclusion
• Started from ~20 samples of 4 different malware families, 5

domain names and 3 IP addresses
• After the investigation:
• 8 different malware families
• 19 domain names, 9 IP addresses
• Tens of different samples

• Infection vector found

37

• List of post exploitation tools
• Victimology confirmed
• Links with two known threat
actors

Conclusion
• Threat intelligence enrich knowledge of a threat actor

• It needs access to big amount of data
• It requires diverse skills

• Each security vendor has its own perspective of the attack
 Collaboration is welcome
