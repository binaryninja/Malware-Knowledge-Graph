Quick review of Babuk ransomware builder
lab52.io/blog/quick-review-of-babuk-ransomware-builder/

Last week, the builder for the Babuk ransomware family was leaked online. Lab52 has
obtained and analyzed this builder sample determining that it is very likely to be authentic.
After their recent official move from Ransomware as a Service to data leaks extortions,
someone uploaded to virusTotal the ransomware builder for unknown reasons, and it was
soon identified as such by British researcher Kevin Beaumont.

What we first find is builder.exe, along with 2 other Windows executable files with .bin
extension, 4 different Unix executables, and note.txt. At a first test, we could see how we
have to tell builder.exe the output folder as an argument, and we noticed that the files
generated were similar to the builder folder files.

After the successful execution, we get the two eliptic curve keys generated for encryption, 3
encryption executables for Windows, ARM-based NAS decives, and VMWare ESXi servers
respectively, together with its corresponding decryption executables.
One interesting thing that we found after these firsts test was that builder.exe would look for
its files in the folder from where it is called, causing an error in case we want to execute
builder.exe with an absolute path from a different location, which could be considered a bug
or, at least, a not so much elegant implementation.

We decided to compare the Windows crypter executable with real samples uploaded to
public sandboxes, and we could first see useful information that was already suggesting that
the builder could indeed be authentic.

We also compared the encryption timing between two samples, getting similar times, which
would be a reinforcement about its authenticity since Babuk is Top 3 fastest ransomware
encryption speed since they updated their efficiency “flaws” identified by Chuong Dong
during his great analysis of the three versions of Babuk. We were also able to also identify
that this was a builder for their last version.
As the final comparison to ensure the authenticity of the sample, we compared the assembly
code of both files using a plugin for IDA pro named Diaphora, and resulting to be almost
identical.

As it could be expected, the builder would take the content of note.txt and use it as the
ransomware note that it would be dropped in the infected machines. Since Babuk decided
not to use any packing mechanism, we could also spot in clear text the ransom note and the
rest of the space reserved for the ransomware note inside the built binaries.

After this, we decided to take a deeper look into the actual builder executable, and we found
out that we could pass as a second argument an actual eliptic curve encyption key, instead
of letting the builder generate it for us, allowing the ransomware operator to use the same
decryption executable for different builds. Furthermore, it has been observed that, if no
encyption key is specified as an argument, the key would be generated randomly.

Argument parsing of Babuk builder
It could also be predictable that the builder would use the binary files as templates, and we
could identify this operations within the assembly code, where it would first read the
“template” file, modify it, and finally write the modification as a new file in the specified folder.

Since Babuk binaries did not use any packer, anyone having these files and a deep
knowledge about them, could have written this builder. However, according to the
compilation dates which seem legit, we do not think this is the actual scenario.
About the decrypter, we have not analyzed its code, but during the tests we realized that it
does not contain the eliptic curve keys hardcoded, therefore it needs to be run from a
command prompt located in the same folder than these generated keys. We could also
identify that it works, but it takes a ridiculous amount of time to decrypt go through the whole
disk and decrypt all the files.
This could be considered important since new ransomware gangs could try to take
advantage of this leak for their own Raas “startup”. However, it is also valuable for
researchers since it will allow us to generate better detection rules, or even track new
unofficial variations of the ransomware family.
