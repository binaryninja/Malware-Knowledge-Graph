Analytic Review
Delta Elektronics highly likely supported by the Russian government and a direct threat to energy sector supply
chain operations
The team asserts with moderate confidence that Delta Elektronics (DE) is likely a front company directly associated with
Energetic Bear (Dragonfly), and the equipment purchased from DE is vulnerable to supply chain threats due to malware
embedded in the Taiwanese Delta Electronics (T-DE) programmable logic controller (PLC) software (unbeknownst to TDE). T-DE is not aware of the infections allowing customers to download and install infected PLC software for the
initial purposes of cyber espionage. Long term intentions include possible physical sabotage operations. The PLCs
appear to be genuine production parts with malware introduced post production. Verification of Oleg Vladimirovich
Strekozovs identity is incomplete; the name is likely fictitious and probably state-sponsored. Evidence that suggests this
outcome:
Malware Targets SCADA Devices
• TTPs are like Dragonfly or Energetic Bear (B2)
• Targeting SCADA devices is consistent with espionage practices (B2)
o Provides hackers a foothold into US critical infrastructure
Delta Website in Taiwan
• A copycat website in Russia is suspicious and consistent with masquerade techniques (C3)
• A legitimate Russian business would not conduct themselves in such a way (C2)
• Delta Electronics, based out of Taiwan and has no records of any locations in St. Petersburg (B2)
Many Russian Domains with Delta Names
•
A legitimate business would not want to have such a
disorganized web presence (C2)
o 20+ companies founded under this name cover various
market sectors and verticals (B2)
• Some of the websites are known to host a variety of malware
(B2)
o Multiple IP’s registered by Oleg and flagged as
malicious (B2)
• A registration certificate exists on delta-electronics.info supporting possible state-sponsorship (C3)
Other Information
• A bill of lading with the name “Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov” (F3)
◦ Strekozov coincidentally translates ‘Dragonfly’ as used by Symantec in early malware discoveries (B2)
• Physical locations for DE appear to be vacant lots, apartment buildings, and non-SCADA businesses (C3)
◦ Matrix Group LLC (DE owner) physical
location secured with gates, fences,
keypad access devices, and security
cameras (C2)
▪ The Matrix Group LLC lists over 260
domain names of varying
legitimacy (B2)
◦ The location of NPO Stoik, a business
named in document metadata found
on Delta Elektronics websites, is in
Moscow, and, along with several other
associated addresses and likely near
buildings used by Russian intelligence
agencies (F3)

•

Yuri Chekunov, Director at a government organization in Khanti-Mansi district owns firms that buy and sell
SCADA equipment (C3)
◦ Yuri’s firms have direct relationships with DE (B2)
◦ Mr. Chekunov approves contracts for the government that his company’s bid on (F3)
◦ It is likely that Mr. Chekunov is part of the Russian oligarchy (F3)

The team recommends placing a company service call to evaluate if anyone tampered with the suspected hardware. Team
1 recommends reducing production levels to minimize safety issues or equipment damage. Manual inspection of
purchased DE equipment required.
We recommend the following:
•
•
•

•

A complete scan, reverse engineering, and analysis of the software provided in a sandbox environment
Identification of other SCADA companies providing downloadable PLC software
o Review and analysis of this software
Engagement with T-DE to determine extent of the infections
o Examine web logs to determine downloads by clients
o Incident declaration and full examination of external hacking and insider threats
Engagement with authorities to identify possible US infections and exploitation

Intelligence gaps include:
•
•
•
•
•

Whether other malware campaigns intersect with this activity
Whether any Chinese organization or agency stands to financially gain from this activity
If any data has been exfiltrated due to the malware
The scope of malware infections at other SCADA companies
Tangible evidence tying DE to the malware on T-DE websites

Alternative Analysis
We assess with low confidence that
Delta Elektronics is a third-party
organization sponsored by the
Russian government or is a false flag
operations posing as a supplier to
legitimate
electronic
company
hardware inserting malware into
foreign industrial supply chains for
espionage purposes. An equally
plausible
assessment
(low
confidence) is that DE is a front
company used by criminals to either
sell counterfeit equipment or to
conduct a fraudulent “middle man”
operation to take a cut of the profit
from the sale of legitimate
equipment.

Narrative Overview – Supporting Information
The behavior analysis topic will be used to discuss a combined case studies related to SCADA systems and the sale of
SCADA hardware and associated software that could be spiked (loaded with malware). The case study would focus on
potential Russian activities in this area, their creation of fake companies, their duplication of websites and website content
to make them look legitimate, and the tracking of the potential people behind this to other malicious cyber activities.
“A new type of war has emerged, in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the
military and political objectives of war to another kind of warfare - information warfare.”
Infiltrating systems in the deployment phase is attractive as this does not require the devices themselves to be vulnerable.
As SCADA systems generally are very poorly maintained, with patch penetrations bordering towards 0% when we have
been able to observe penetration on the market. The intentions apart from directly affecting those systems as means in a
conflict, they are often deployed on networks from where they can reach other internal resources. Being able to infect
devices which are likely to spend 10 to 20 years on a network largely unmaintained is one of the most stable sources of
persistence a threat actor can obtain. This means the devices not only provide means of controlling critical infrastructure
in other nations, but it is also a means of obtaining access to other internal resources for an extended period.
Take for example the BlackEnergy attacks against Ukrainian SCADA assets. Assumed Russian cyber adversaries disrupted
power grid operations causing blackouts for over 225,000 customers in Ukraine. The attack was highly complex using a
methodical approach to planning, direction, intelligence collection, resource utilization, mission management, expert
skills, highly malicious payloads, and combinations of manual, semi, continuous levels of automation.
Targeted intellection collection started months before the attack execution. Run like a well-managed special forces
operation, the adversaries clandestinely created persistent access footholds to multiple industrial networks, identified
Ukrainian energy-related targets, before carrying out an integrated, complex, and process-driven operation that disrupted
electricity distribution and destroyed various systems, flooded call centers, distorted internal systems, and impeded
incident response. Based upon system design and intelligence on the target, malware deployed by the adversaries
exploited weaknesses in access protocols to gain administrative access to critical systems. Once inside, adversaries created
valid administrative accounts enabling lateral movement across trusted systems. The adversaries achieved their goals by
shutting down power distribution to key functions of the grid.
Another possible aspect of exploiting SCADA systems starts at the physical level. Russian corporations are mimicking global
organizations that research and development, design, manufacture, and sale of electronic control systems, industrial
automation products, digital display products, communication products, consumer electronics products, energy-saving
lighting application, and energy technology (DLELY Key Statistics - Delta Electronics Inc., 2017) services. One such
organization is Delta Electronics from Taiwan.
The accelerating trends of supply chain globalization and outsourced manufacturing and distribution have combined to
increase the pace of change, complexity, and risk for brand owners. These trends have created a fundamental shift in the
way companies of all sizes plan, source, make, and deliver their goods and services. The Russian focus to actively target
various phases of the supply chain makes for malware installation to be viewed as normal network activity. An activity
that is deemed normal upon installation of the hardware and software in question.
Supply chains are difficult to secure; they create a risk that is hard to identify, complicated to quantify and costly to
address. A compromise anywhere in the supply chain can have just as much impact on your organization, and its
reputation, as one from within the organization. There is great necessity to track everything that is happening in the supply
chain as even the smallest supplier, or the slightest hiccup can have a dangerous impact on your business.
The cyber security industry has already seen USB-devices shipped with malware straight out of the factory, just as we have
seen CD's from magazines with malware during the 90's. Affecting devices in the production line is of course equally
tempting to actors from Russia as it is for the NSA. A state actor focusing on monitoring citizens has different requirements

from a nation building its cyber arms arsenal. Where the NSA had a focus on networking equipment and traffic monitoring,
this makes the same degree of sense from a cyber arms perspective.
Russian methods of information influence and information operations include network operations alongside disciplines
such as psychological operations, strategic communications, Influence, along with “intelligence, counterintelligence,
maskirovka, disinformation, electronic warfare, debilitation of communications, degradation of navigation support,
psychological pressure, and destruction of enemy computer capabilities. Taken together, this forms a whole of systems,
methods, and tasks to influence the perception and behavior of the enemy, population, and international community on
all levels.
One fundamental distinction between Russian and Western approaches to information activities is the categorization of
computer network operations and other activities in cyberspace.
“Cyber” as a separate function or domain is not a Russian concept. The delineation of activities in the cyber domain from
other activities processing, attacking, disrupting or stealing information is seen as artificial in Russian thinking. In this
context, “Distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS), advanced [cyber] exploitation techniques and Russia Today
television are all related tools of information warfare.
A key concept often lost on the West is Russia’s willingness to give primacy to non-kinetic operations, especially
information warfare. The Western assumption has been that subversion, deception, and the like are all ‘force multipliers’
to the combat arms, not forces in their own right. At present, though, Russia is clearly seeing the kinetic and the nonkinetic as interchangeable and mutually supporting.
Russia's use of the tools of information pressure - a key theme of the latest statements by the representatives of the state
administration sector in Ukraine. At the same time, Russia denies any involvement in the facts of information aggression:
hacking databases, network services and the use of information technology for propaganda purposes.
The Russian targeting of various phases of the SCADA supply chain represents information-technology warfare (to affect
technical systems which receive, collect, process and transmit information), which is conducted during wars and armed
conflicts. The behaviors exhibited by the perpetrators is not usually targeted. Examining Russian activities within the
SCADA supply chain requires analysis focused on users, user accounts, user identities, and the sources of their activities.
Openly selling to various Western, Asian, and Middle Eastern energy organizations who purchase from these known
companies is a method to infiltrate critical infrastructures in target organizations globally. The potential for use later is
part of an overall sea, air, land, cyber integrated strategy of hybrid warfare.
This is but one aspect of hybrid warfare attacks against the energy sector. The use of malicious code such as BlackEnergy
serves as a reminder of the combined efforts by adversaries in using access to hardware in the supply chain and external
infiltration of this hardware without attribution. Since the December 2015 attack against Ukraine’s power grid, the Ukraine
has experienced 6,500 cyber hacks to state institutions in November and December 2016 alone. Ukraine has accused
Russia of these cyber-attacks, but Moscow has denied involvement. A standard behavior of non-attributable, hybrid
warfare. (Douris, 2017)

Chronology of Russian Attacks (Timeline: Ten Years of Russian Cyber Attacks on Other, n.d.)
Russian cyber attacks normally occur in conjunction with geopolitical events. They are part of his overall scheme of hybrid
warfare. Amid a show of hybrid tactics, Putin has awarded financial support to fringe political movements in Western
Europe, launched cyberattacks and espionage in Europe, and ordered probing and actual attacks on U.S. and European
energy and communications infrastructure. He has continued to attempt to use control over energy – pipelines, nuclear
plants, natural gas supplies – to wield influence across Europe. Western intelligence reports say Russia has exacerbated
the Syrian migrant crisis. And, compounding the threat, Russia has formed a growing alliance with Iran and China, countries

that possess their own hybrid toolboxes of proxy warfare and cyber infiltration. (Mazarr, 2015) Another standard behavior
of hybrid warfare and one used against the energy sector.
Russia’s actions based upon ‘maskirovka’ deploys few military assets while coordinating multiple functions of
disinformation, psychological warfare, memetic enginerring, and deception to achieve goals. Russia’s actions are likened
to placing a frog in a pot of cool water on a stove. While slowly heating up the water, the frog finds it difficult to notice
the increasing temperatures until it is too late. All the time not knowing who actually placed him (the frog) in the water
and not knowing who continued to turn up the burner. Maskirovka translates to camoflage but is also defined as the
elements of surprise, diversion, and deception. Russia’s asymmetrical activity prevales on the internet, in social media,
and as truth and is inclusive of all functions of warfare. The methods are relatively cheap and capitalize on the years of
studying Western behaviors. Russia is able to hack, infiltrate, manipulate, and manage the perceptions of targets while
ensuring plausible deniability. They do so by using proxy groups, hackers for hire, and trained operatives all behind a
monitor and keyboard.

April - May 2007: Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation that was occupied by the Soviet Union until 1991, angered
Moscow by planning to move a Russian World War II memorial and Russian soldiers' graves. Russia retaliated
by temporarily disabling Estonia's internet, an especially harsh blow to the world's most internet-dependent
economy. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack focused on government offices and financial
institutions, disrupting communications.
June 2008: In a similar attack, Russia punished another former possession in the Baltic. When the Lithuanian
government outlawed the display of Soviet symbols, Russian hackers defaced government web pages with
hammer-and-sickles and five-pointed stars.
August 2008: After Georgia's pro-Western government sent troops into a breakaway republic backed by
Moscow, Russian land, sea and air units invaded the country - and Russian hackers attacked Georgia's internet,
the first-time Russia coordinated military, and cyber action. Georgia's internal communications were
effectively shut down.
January 2009: As part of an effort to persuade the president of Kyrgyzstan to evict an American military base,
Russian hackers shut down two of the country's four internet service providers with a DDOS attack. It worked.
Kyrgyzstan removed the military base. Subsequently, Kyrgyzstan received $2 billion in aid and loans from the
Kremlin.
April 2009: After a media outlet in Kazakhstan published a statement by Kazakhstan's president that criticized
Russia, a DDOS attack attributed to Russian elements shut down the outlet.
August 2009: Russian hackers shut down Twitter and Facebook in Georgia to commemorate the first
anniversary of the Russian invasion.
2014 – The Pentagon blamed Russia for a sophisticated hack into the White House’s unclassified email
correspondence and the State Department.
March 2014: For the second time, the Russian government allegedly coordinated military and cyber action. A
DDOS attack 32 times larger than the largest known attack used during Russia's invasion of Georgia disrupted
the internet in Ukraine while Russian-armed pro-Russian rebels were seizing control of the Crimea. (JohnIB,
n.d.)
May 2014: Three days before Ukraine's presidential election, a Russia-based hacking group, took down the
country's election commission in an overnight attack. Even a back-up system was taken down, but Ukrainian
computer experts were able to restore the system before election day. Ukrainian police say they arrested
hackers who were trying to rig the results. The attack was aimed at creating chaos and hurting the nationalist
candidate while helping the pro-Russian candidate. Russia's preferred candidate lost.
o BlackEnergy Chronology
 2007 - The first version of BlackEnergy appeared in 2007 used to launch DDoS attacks, create
botnets and steal banking credentials and so on. (Antiy, n.d.)

2008 - During the Russian-Georgian conflict, BlackEnergy used to conduct cyber-attacks against
Georgia.
 2009 - In Citibank attack, the attacker had stolen tens of millions of dollars.
 2010 - BlackEnergy2 is released in 2010 supporting more plug-in features.
 2014 - The updated version BlackEnergy defined Ukraine and Poland as its attack targets.
 October 2014 - BlackEnergy attacks HMI of several providers, the victims include GE, Advantech
WebAccess, SiemensWinCC.
 14 October 2014 - iSIGHT discovered BlackEnergy sample which is delivered via CVE-2014-4114.

 December 2014 - The Information Security Report published German Federal Office for
Information Security (BSI) in 2014 a cyber-attack against the infrastructure of one German mill.
The attack caused significant physical damage. Reports indicated that the incident was related to
BlackEnergy.
 November 2015 - During the presidential election in Ukraine, KillDisk infected several media
agencies.
 December 2015 - Ukraine government asserted that BlackEnergy should responsible for the
blackout incidents in the region of Lavno-Franklvst of Ukraine.
May 2015: German investigators discovered hackers had penetrated the computer network of the German
Bundestag, the most significant hack in German history. The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV),
German's domestic intelligence service, later said Russia was behind the attack and that they were seeking
information not just on the workings of the Bundestag, but German leaders and NATO, among others. Security
experts said hackers were trying to penetrate the computers of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian
Democratic party.
2015 – France Russia sought to destroy France’s TV5Monde channel via an April 2015 cyberattack. The attack
took the channel off air for several hours.
October 2015 - At the November NATO meeting in Bulgaria, its prime minister explained that Starting on 25
October, websites of the council of ministers of Parliament and the central election committee were attacked
through cyber capabilities in an unprecedented way. The Prime Minister blamed the Russians for the attacks,
as it also coincided with increased incursions into their airspace by Russian planes.
2015: Turkey blamed Russia for a massive cyber-attack that forced it to close external traffic to NIC.tr, making
it impossible to access or send email from .tr addresses. Turkey had been at odds with Russia after shooting
down a Russian plane in its airspace.
2016: US Democratic National Committee. Starting with the Democratic National Convention and continuing
into the fall campaign, Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks has released emails purportedly coming from the
Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. A Joint Statement from the Department of
Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence put the blame squarely on the Russians.

BlackEnergy
Execution and Behavior

Step 1: Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering. Before the attack, adversaries likely begin open-source
intelligence gathering and reconnaissance on potential targets. (WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, n.d.)
Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014 or earlier
Device/application: Activity conducted external to network
Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network

Exploitation method: Adversaries likely gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network
architecture, and may also use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of
devices, social media data collection and analysis for future targeting

Step 2: Malware Development and Weaponization. Adversaries acquire or independently develop the malware
to be used in the attack, as well as the weaponized documents to deliver malware.
Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014 or earlier
Device/application: Activity conducted external to network
Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network
Exploitation method: Adversaries acquire BlackEnergy remote access Trojan (RAT) and weaponize Microsoft
(MS) Word and Excel files with VBA scripts to drop the BlackEnergy RAT.
Impact: Combined with targeting data gathered during the reconnaissance phase, adversaries can develop
tailored attack packages. At the completion of this step, adversaries have the necessary tools to begin their
attack.

Step 3: Deliver Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Adversaries initiate phishing campaign against electricity
distributors. Step 4: Install RAT. Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors
after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014–June 2015e
Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet
Explorer web browser
Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other IT services used in business operations.
Exploitation method: Adversaries send targeted emails containing the modified MS Office files as attachments to
users on targeted networks.
Impact: RAT is delivered to targeted network, but not installed. Installation requires employees to actively grant
permission to the embedded VBA scripts to execute.

Step 4: Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees
open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
Location: Corporate network
Action: Employee-enabled malware execution
Timeline: May 2014–June 2015
Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet
Explorer web browser
Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations.
Exploitation method: In a social engineering attack, employees are prompted to enable macros when opening
the file attached to phishing email. Once macros are enabled, the VBA script places multiple malicious files on
the workstation, unbeknown to the employee.
Impact: Files placed on workstations within the corporate network can begin the communication process with
external Command and Control (CC) servers.

Step 5: Establish CC Connection. Malware establishes connection from the malicious implant on the targeted
network to attacker-controlled CC server.
Location: Corporate network Action: Malware execution Timeline: May 2014–June 2015
Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet
Explorer web browser
Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations.
Exploitation method: The external connection is established as part of the execution routine following
installation of the malicious files. Once permissions to execute macros are granted by employees, the malicious
VBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via
HTTP requests.
Impact: Adversaries gain unauthorized access to targeted networks, including the ability to deliver additional
BlackEnergy plugins to enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

Step 6: Deliver Malware Plugins Following installation of BlackEnergy 3 implant, adversaries likely import plugins to
enable credential harvesting and internal network reconnaissance.
Location: Corporate network
Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Employee
workstations,
likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser
Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations
Exploitation method: The BlackEnergy 3 implant delivered in the initial attack functions as a receiver for
additional malware plugins. After establishing a remote connection with delivered files via HTTPS, the threat
likely delivers the additional malware components.
Impact: The delivered plugins enable additional BlackEnergy functionality, including harvesting user credentials,
keylogging, and network reconnaissance.

Step 7: Harvest Credentials. Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery
functions.
Delivered BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
Location: Corporate network
Action: Active threat actor activity, malware execution
Timeline: June 2015–December 2015
Device/application: Windows OS workstations, Windows domain controllers, virtual private network (VPN)
service deployed in control environment
Role in infrastructure: These systems support business operations, manage permissions and domain access, and
provide remote network access respectively.
Exploitation method: Adversaries use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log
keystrokes. After gathering valid credentials for user with administrator privileges, adversaries use the stolen

administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new
privileged accounts.
Impact: Adversaries obtain valid credentials enabling them to expand access across the corporate network and
into the control environment, ensure persistent access, and blend into regular network traffic.

Step 8: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network
Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on corporate network to discover potential targets and expand
accessed.
Location: Corporate network
Action: Active threat actor activity, malware execution Timeline: June 2015–December 2015
Device/application: Discovered systems, including networked uninterruptable power supply (UPS) devices, data
center servers, a telephone communications server, and employee workstations
Role in infrastructure: Internal reconnaissance efforts could potentially include all deployed devices on the
corporate network.
Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use a combination of valid user credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins
developed to conduct network discovery. VS.dll plugin is likely used to leverage MS Sysinternals PsExec to
establish remote connections to workstations and servers.
Impact: Adversaries can enumerate the systems deployed across the network, identify targets, and begin
preparations for final attack.

Step 9: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network
Adversaries use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed
systems.
Location: ICS network
Action: Active threat actor activity
Timeline: June 2015–December 2015
Device/application: Discovered systems, including human machine interface (HMI) workstations, distributed
management system (DMS) servers, UPS devices, 52 serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus, 53
IRZRUH2 3G54), remote terminal unit (RTU) devices (ABB RTU560 CMU-02), and the substation breakers
Role in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor
and control devices within the control environment.
DMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment. UPS
devices condition incoming power to downstream devices and provide temporary battery backup power. Serialto-Ethernet converters convert serial data from field devices to digital packets, enabling communications with
the control center. RTU devices function as a communication processor or a data concentrator in a substation,
enabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center.
Substation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit.
Exploitation method: Adversaries use valid credentials to interact directly with the client application for the DMS
server via a VPN, and native remote access services to access employee workstations hosting HMI applications.
This access likely enables adversaries to enumerate all networked devices within the control environment.

Impact: Adversaries gain access to critical systems, enabling them to begin target selection and preparations for
final attack.

Step 10: Develop Malicious Computer Code. Adversaries develop malicious computer code update for identified
serial-to-Ethernet converters.
Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015
Device/application: Activity conducted external to network
Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network
Exploitation method: After identifying deployed converts, adversaries begin a malware development and testing
effort on infrastructure outside of the targeted network.
Impact: Upon completion of this step, adversaries would have target-specific malware designed to disrupt
communications with field devices by disabling deployed converters.

Step 11: Deliver Data Destruction Malware. Adversaries likely deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set
policy on the domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot.
Location: Corporate and ICS network
Action: Active threat actor activity
Timeline: December 2015, directly preceding attack
Device/application: Network share and Windows domain controller server
Role in infrastructure: The network share provides access to shared digital resources, and the Windows domain
controller manages access control throughout the network.
Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use stolen credentials to place KillDisk malware on a network share, then
set the retrieval and execution of the malicious files by implementing a policy on the compromised domain
controller server.
Impact: Prescheduling execution of malware enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that
data destruction coincides with or shortly follows attacks against breakers.

Step 12: Schedule Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Disruption. Adversaries schedule unauthorized
outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers.
Location: Corporate and ICS network
Action: Active threat actor activity
Timeline: Directly preceding December 2015 attack
Device/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface
Role in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems.
Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use valid credentials to access privileged employee accounts, then use
this access to remotely schedule unauthorized power outages.

Impact: Prescheduling outages enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that critical systems
also go down because of the power outages, stifling potential restoration efforts.

Step 13: Trip Breakers. Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and
disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers within three distribution areas.
Location: ICS network
Action: Active threat actor activity
Timeline: December 23, 2015, during
Device/application: HMI workstations, DMS servers, RTU, and the substation breakers
Role in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor
and control devices within the control environment.
DMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment.
Substation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit.
Exploitation method: Adversaries use valid credentials to seize control of operator workstations, access DMS
client application via VPN, and issue unauthorized commands to breakers at substations.
Impact: Opening of breakers results in disruption of electricity service to customers.

Step 14: Sever Connection to Field Devices. After opening the breakers, adversaries deliver malicious computer
code update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices. The malicious updates render the converters inoperable,
and sever connections between the control center and the substations.
Location: ICS network
Action: Active threat actor activity
Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack
Device/application: Serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus,55 IRZRUH2 3G56)
Role in infrastructure: Convert serial data from field devices to digital packets to be transmitted to remote
monitoring and administration systems within the control network.
Exploitation method: Adversaries use network access to push the malicious update over the network to targeted
devices.
Impact: Operators are unable to remotely close the breakers, requiring workers to manually close breakers at
each substation. Forcing this manual response draws out recovery time

Step 15: Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack. Adversaries initiate DoS attack on telephone call center at one of
the targeted distributors.
Location: Corporate network
Action: Likely automated process
Timeline: Dec 23, 2015, during attack
Device/application: Operator telephone call center

Role in infrastructure: Receive external telephone communications from customers.
Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use automated IP-based call generators to flood the targeted call center.
Impact: Automated calls overwhelm resources at call center, blocking legitimate communications from
customers.

Step 16: Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage. Previously scheduled UPS outage cuts power to targeted
telephone communications server and data center servers.
Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Execution of prescheduled process Timeline: December 23, 2015,
during attack
Device/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface, telephone communications
server, and data center servers
Role in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems.
Exploitation method: Adversaries use network access to schedule the temporary backup power to be offline at
the time of the power outages.
Impact: Power loss to telephone server disrupts communications across remote sites, and disruptions at control
centers inhibit ability to monitor and respond to attack against breakers. The disruption at the data center and
associated system reboot trigger execution of KillDisk malware.

Step 17: Destroy Critical System Data. Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records
and deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims’ corporate and ICS network.
Location: Corporate network and ICS network
Action: Malware execution
Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack
Device/application: RTU device (ABB RTU560 CMU-02),57 servers and workstations used by management,
human resources (HR), and finance staff
Role in infrastructure: The RTU functions as a communication processor or data concentrator in a substation,
enabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center.58
Servers and workstations are used by management, HR, and finance staff to conduct business administration
operations.
Exploitation method: Malware is retrieved from the network share and executed on networked devices
according to direction received via domain controller policy or local Windows Task Scheduler.
Impact: Targeted systems are rendered inoperable, and critical data is destroyed.

DragonFly
An ongoing cyberespionage campaign against a range of targets, mainly in the energy sector, gave attackers the ability to
mount sabotage operations against their victims. The attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to
compromise (Star Report, n.d.) some strategically important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the
sabotage capabilities open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries.
Among the targets of Dragonfly were energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline
operators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers. The majority of the victims were located in the United
States, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Poland. (Dragonfly, n.d.)
The Dragonfly group is well resourced, with a range of malware tools at its disposal and is capable of launching attacks
through some different vectors. Its most ambitious attack campaign saw it compromise some industrial control system
(ICS) equipment providers, infecting their software with a remote access-type Trojan. This caused companies to install the
malware when downloading software updates for computers running ICS equipment. These infections not only gave the
attackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations’ networks but also gave them the means to mount sabotage
operations against infected ICS computers.
This campaign follows in the footsteps of Stuxnet, which was the first known major malware campaign to target ICS
systems. While Stuxnet was narrowly targeted at the Iranian nuclear program and had sabotage as its primary goal,
Dragonfly appears to have a much broader focus with espionage and persistent access as its current objective with
sabotage as an optional capability if required.
In addition to compromising ICS software, Dragonfly has used spam email campaigns and watering hole attacks to infect
targeted organizations. The group has used two main malware tools: Backdoor.Oldrea and Trojan.Karagany. The former
appears to be a custom piece of malware, either written by or for the attackers.
Before publication, Symantec notified affected victims and relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency
Response Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents.

Background
The Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, appears to have been in operation since at
least 2011 and may have been active even longer than that. Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies
in the US and Canada before shifting its focus mainly to US and European energy firms in early 2013.
The campaign against the European and American energy sector quickly expanded in scope. The group initially began
sending malware in phishing emails to personnel in target firms. This behavior changed to watering hole attacks
compromising websites likely to be visited by those working in energy to redirect them to websites hosting an exploit kit.
The exploit kit, in turn, delivered malware to the victim’s computer. The third phase of the campaign was the Trojanizing
of legitimate software bundles belonging to three different ICS equipment manufacturers. These behaviors represent a
combined approach that continues to evolve but ensures weaknesses in software and the supply chain are equally
exploited.
Dragonfly’s behavior is representative of a state-sponsored operation. Dragonfly mounts attacks through multiple vectors
and compromise numerous third party websites in the process as a tool to ensure anonymity. Dragonfly targeted several
organizations in the energy sector. Its current main motive appears to be cyberespionage, with sabotage a definite
secondary capability potentially for later use.
Time analysis behaviors of timestamps on the malware used by the attackers indicates that the group mostly worked
between Monday and Friday, with activity mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period that corresponded to a 9 am to 6
pm working day in the UTC +4 time zone. Based on this information, it is likely the attackers are based in Eastern Europe.
(Energy Sector Alert, n.d.)

Tools employed
Dragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are remote access tool (RAT) type malware which
(Dragonfly vs. America, Courtesy of Russia , n.d.) provides the attackers with access and control of compromised
computers. Dragonfly’s favored malware tool is Backdoor. Oldrea, which is also known as Havex or the Energetic Bear
RAT. Oldrea acts as a backdoor (Symantec, n.d.; Symantec, n.d.) for the attackers on to the victim’s computer, allowing
them to extract data and install further malware.
Oldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some indication
of the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group.
Oldrea’s behavior once installed is to gather system information, along with lists of files, programs installed, and the root
of available drives. It will also extract data from the computer’s Outlook address book and VPN configuration files. This
data is then written to a temporary file in an encrypted format before being sent to a remote command-and-control (C&C)
server controlled by the attackers. The file obfuscation ensures anonymity of content.
The C&C servers appear to be hosted on compromised servers running content management systems, indicating that the
attackers may have used the same exploit to gain control of each server. This behavior follows the model of maskirovka.
Oldrea has a basic control panel which allows an authenticated user to download a compressed version of the stolen data
for each particular victim.
The second main tool used by Dragonfly is Trojan.Karagany. Unlike Oldrea, Karagany was available on the underground
market. The source code for version 1 of Karagany was leaked in 2010. Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken
this source code and modified it for its own use thereby further validating the risk of leaving cyber weaponry on the
battlefield. This version is detected by Symantec as Trojan.Karagany!gen1.
Karagany is capable of uploading stolen data, downloading new files, and running executable files on an infected
computer. Karagany has additional behaviors such as running additional plugins, using tools for collecting passwords,
taking screenshots, and cataloging documents on infected computers. The intent to analyze the data for later exploitation.
Symantec found that the majority of computers compromised by the attackers were infected with Oldrea. Karagany was
only used in around 5 percent of infections.

Multiple attack vectors
The Dragonfly group has used at least three infection behaviors against targets in the energy sector. The initial behavior
was an email campaign, which saw targeted executives and senior employees in energy companies receive emails
containing a malicious PDF attachment. Infected emails had one of two subject lines: “The account” or “Settlement of
delivery problem”.
The spam campaign began in February 2013 and continued into June 2013. Symantec identified seven different
organizations targeted in this campaign. This behavior ceased as organizational defenses improved.
The attackers then shifted their behaviors to watering hole attacks, comprising some energy-related websites and injecting
an iframe into each which redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit.
Lightsout exploits either Java or Internet Explorer to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer. The fact that the
attackers compromised multiple legitimate websites for each stage of the operation is further evidence that the group
has strong technical capabilities while changing tactics. The tactics may have changed due to vendor reporting on
adversary behaviors.
In September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing
page for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then
redirected to an URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected.

Trojanized software
The most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of some legitimate software packages. Three
different ICS equipment providers were targeted, and malware was inserted into the software bundles they had made
available for download on their websites. All three companies made equipment that is used in some industrial sectors,
including energy. Delta Electronics, which we cover later in this document, could be subjected to the same malware.
The first identified Trojanized software was a product used to provide VPN access to programmable logic controller (PLC)
type devices. The vendor discovered the attack shortly after it was mounted, but there had already been 250 unique
downloads of the compromised software.
The second company to be compromised was a European manufacturer of specialist PLC type devices. In this instance, a
software package containing a driver for one of its devices was compromised. Symantec estimates that the Trojanized
software was available for download for at least six weeks in June and July 2013.
The third firm attacked was a European company which develops systems to manage wind turbines, biogas plants, and
other energy infrastructure. Symantec believes that compromised software may have been available for download for
approximately ten days in April 2014.
The Dragonfly group is technically adept and able to think strategically. Given the size of some of its targets, the group
found a “soft underbelly” by compromising their suppliers, which are invariably smaller, less protected companies.
Unauthorized resellers were not examined as part of the analysis nor was the potential for “knock off” companies selling
counterfeit hardware.

Intelligence/Reconnaissance:
Russian information on the formation of the companies established under the name of Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov.
Begin dates of the companies and the monies used to create the companies is listed below. Recovered documents indicate
other names involved in certain companies under the Oleg name.
(Registration numbers of Russian companies., n.d.)INN – Identifying Tax Number of a tax-payer (consists of 10 digits). Each
Russian company has its unique tax number concerning all taxes and duties. Usually, an abbreviation "INN" is used in
English letters. INN number is given to a Russian company by the respective state tax body at the moment of company’s
tax registration in the place of its legal address. As a proof of tax registration, the company receives a certificate with INN
issued by the tax body. INN is included in all tax notices and declarations, as well as in Russian bank transfer documents.
INN is enough to receive much official info about a Russian company from the Federal Register of Russian companies "EGRUL."

OGRN
OGRN – Major State Registration Number of the entry made in the Register about the formation of a Russian company
(consists of 12 digits). Provided the company was registered before July 1, 2002, OGRN is the number of the entry in the
Register about the first filing of information into the Register about the company according to the federal law. Each legal
person in Russia has its unique OGRN. OGRN is used in the Register as the number of registration file of a company. As a
proof of its OGRN, a company receives the certificate with OGRN issued by the state registration body. OGRN is included
into all entries in the Register, all documents issued on specific registration actions. OGRN number lets you receive much
official info about a Russian company from the Register.

Gaps and Assumptions
Treadstone 71 believes it would be good to know some more details about how PLCs are used in oil and gas
transportation. How many are deployed in the typical pipeline? What are key vulnerable points? How many would
have to be attacked to create some stoppage for a significant period? Also, it would be very interesting to know about
Delta's legitimate business. Who buys from them and with how much volume?
What appears clearly is that there is a bunch of companies registered to this Oleg Strekozov and that his name also
appears in some WHOISs about shady sites and that he has some association with malware. Whether he is corporeal
or virtual, Mr. Strekozov is associated with Russian cyber organized crime. Treadstone 71 can immediately say that
successful organizations of this type are associated with FSB and controlled by oligarchs. Successful oligarchs are close
to Putin and, of course, Putin controls the FSB. Real or unreal, Mr. Strekozov is a tool of such a hierarchy.
Treadstone 71 is careful to leap to conclusions about whether Mr. Strekozov is real. He could be a made-up name
used for certain registrations, or he could be the weekend doorman at Lubyanka (in jest). But he could be real. His
patronymic is Vladimirovich so that the judge could be his father. A look at Facebook finds an Oleg in the Belarusan
town of Hlybokaye, educated in eastern Ukraine, about 25 years old. We do not discount him because of age--billions
change hands hourly in Moscow, and there are plenty of young criminals driving Maserati’s with a bottle of expensive
whiskey in their hand. Real or unreal, S's
address of Proezd Dmitrovskiy is in an
upscale neighborhood that is also not far
from Lubyanka.
 European locations – no mention of
Russia
 Asian locations – no mention of Russia
 Several US locations including Houston

Delta or Delta? The more Treadstone 71
investigates on this company, the more
skeptical we have become about the
innocence of the Taiwanese company.
We have found that the Russian Delta has
attended trade shows and held press
conferences. With thousands of dollars
of sales and only a limited number of
companies that make PLCs, do we believe
that some people in Taipei are unaware
about this? Treadstone 71 has discovered
other companies that do business in
Russia but try not to advertise that in the
West. Could it be that Delta-Ru is buying
or arranging sales and Delta-Tai is happy
to turn away from this? The price for
doing such business in and through
Russia is, of course, to take Russian
partner. Either way, the possibility of
supply chain contamination is real.
In applying an informal analysis of
competing for a hypothesis to all this,
Treadstone 71 has come up with two
more hypotheses that fit the facts (as
they stand now, understanding that
more information and analysis is
needed).
This could be an effort to cause serial
failures that could drive up energy prices,
although the coordination and precision for this to work past a few days would be extraordinary.
Another possibility is that this is just a scheme for some oligarchs to make money. They speculate on buying a tanker
filled with crude. While tanker is at sea, an incident occurs at some pipeline or port spiking the price of oil and Oleg's
tanker pulls into Rotterdam right at the peak.
Finally, this could be just a part of a Russian medium-term strategy to contaminate as much hardware, firmware, and
software as possible.

are not the same company?
 What could the motivation for Russia be to pose
as Delta Electronics?
▪

Hardware used in gas and oil production

▪ Sold in international markets – global name –

Treadstone 71 can imagine all kinds of functions that could be contaminated with logic bombs and backdoors, ready
for the call of the Rodina (Russian Motherland).
It should be noted that these three hypotheses are not mutually exclusive of one another as the motivations could
logically coexist.

Analysis of Competing Hypotheses I

Analysis of Competing Hypotheses II

In Summary
Although there is an absence of evidence
supporting a direct alignment of
BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, and Delta
Elektronics, the similarity of the targets,
assumed adversary intent, the behaviors
and methods of deception are consistent
with nation-state actions. We estimate the
likelihood of Russian complicity to be
probable. The evidence collected and
subsequent analysis using structured
techniques does not render our judgment
to be fact or a certainty, however, and
such judgments still carry a risk of being
wrong. Some of the information is
fragmented and poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences. Some sources are difficult to validate. Typical
compartmentalization of intelligence activities may be used to ensure complete lack of awareness of activities at the
operational level. Leadership over the groups behind BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, and Delta Elektronics may be limited in a
“Dunbar’s number” method of maintain secrecy.
We cannot rule out direct Russian involvement based upon previous judgments and behaviors by the Russian government
and Russian proxies. Historical profiling of Russian activities indicates at a minimum, their participation in these activities.
Adversary intent, whether it is BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, or Delta Elektronics combined with expert capabilities enables a
high probability of threat. Additionally, the probability of threat occurrence in unison with the success of the actions and
the overall impact(s) when examined considering the Ukrainian attacks, represents an elevated level of risk.
The use of hybrid warfare methods in combination with constantly moving attack vectors makes difficult, attribution and
methods of defense. The adversary(s) behind the actions demonstrate information superiority while revealing behaviors
with similarities. Continued data and information collection for analysis is required but serves as a double-edged sword.
This sword ensures we continue to churn examining multiple different versions of information using limited resources
while missing the primary intent and potentially simple conclusion as to the intent and success of the adversary(s).
