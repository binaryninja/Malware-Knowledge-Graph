Attracting more than a half-million annual readers, this is the security community's go-to
destination for technical breakdowns of the latest threats, critical vulnerability disclosures
and cutting-edge research.
Trustwave SpiderLabs has discovered a new malware family, dubbed GoldenSpy,
embedded in tax payment software that a Chinese bank requires corporations to
install to conduct business operations in China.
In April of 2020, the Trustwave SpiderLabs Threat Fusion Team engaged a customer to
conduct a threat hunt. The company is a global technology vendor with significant
government business in the US, Australia, UK, and recently opened offices in China. Our
threat hunt produced several key findings important to the long-term security of their
1/7

network, however, one key finding stood out as potentially impacting countless other
businesses who currently operate in China. A full analysis of our findings is available for
download in this report.

Investigation Details
2/7

We identified an executable file displaying highly unusual behavior and sending system
information to a suspicious Chinese domain. Discussions with our client revealed that this
was part of their bank’s required tax software. They informed us that upon opening
operations in China, their local Chinese bank required that they install a software package
called Intelligent Tax produced by the Golden Tax Department of Aisino Corporation, for
paying local taxes.
As we continued our investigation into the tax software, we found that it worked as
advertised, but it also installed a hidden backdoor on the system that enabled a remote
adversary to execute Windows commands or to upload and execute any binary (to include
ransomware, trojans, or other malware). Basically, it was a wide-open door into the network
with SYSTEM level privileges and connected to a command and control server completely
separate from the tax software’s network infrastructure. Based on this, and several other
factors (described below) we determined this file to have sufficient characteristics to be
malware. We’ve since fully reverse-engineered the files and named the family GoldenSpy.
GoldenSpy was digitally signed by a company called Chenkuo Network Technology and the
signature used identical text for both the product and description fields; 认证软件版本升级服
务 – which translates to “certified software version upgrade service”. This name may sound
like legitimate software, however, in this situation the tax software already has its own
updater service that functions well, and in a way completely unrelated to GoldenSpy.
There were several other unusual aspects of this file, to include:
GoldenSpy installs two identical versions of itself, both as persistent autostart
services. If either stops running, it will respawn its counterpart. Furthermore, it utilizes
an exeprotector module that monitors for the deletion of either iteration of itself. If
deleted, it will download and execute a new version. Effectively, this triple-layer
protection makes it exceedingly difficult to remove this file from an infected system.
The Intelligent Tax software’s uninstall feature will not uninstall GoldenSpy. It leaves
GoldenSpy running as an open backdoor into the environment, even after the tax
software is fully removed.
GoldenSpy is not downloaded and installed until a full two hours after the tax software
installation process is completed. When it finally downloads and installs, it does so
silently, with no notification on the system. This long delay is highly unusual and a
method to hide from the victim’s notice.
GoldenSpy does not contact the tax software’s network infrastructure (i-xinnuo[.]com),
rather it reaches out to ningzhidata[.]com, a domain known to host other variations of
GoldenSpy malware. After the first three attempts to contact its command and control
server, it randomizes beacon times. This is a known method to avoid network security
technologies designed to identify beaconing malware.

3/7

GoldenSpy operates with SYSTEM level privileges, making it highly dangerous and
capable of executing any software on the system. This includes additional malware or
Windows administrative tools to conduct reconnaissance, create new users, escalate
privileges, etc.
These factors have led us to the conclusion that GoldenSpy is a well-hidden and powerful
backdoor that surrenders full remote command and control of the victim system to an
unknown adversary.
The diagram below shows the network communication patterns of GoldenSpy installation
via Intelligent Tax software.

The scope of this campaign is not currently known. For our client, GoldenSpy was secretly
embedded within the Aisino Intelligent tax software, but we cannot determine if this was
targeted because of their access to vital data, or if this campaign impacts every company
doing business in China. We have identified similar activity at a global financial institution,
but do not yet have further telemetry into this campaign.
The current GoldenSpy campaign began in April of 2020, however, our cyber threat intel
analysts have discovered variations of GoldenSpy that date back to December of 2016. It is
of interest that Chenkuo Technology’s website announced a partnership with Aisino in
October of 2016, two months prior to the original emergence of the GoldenSpy malware
family. Their partnership is for “big data cooperation”. GoldenSpy certainly could enable big

4/7

data access and collection. Trustwave SpiderLabs has no current knowledge if GoldenSpy
was active in the wild since 2016, our first identification of usage was April 2020. To be
clear, we do not yet know the scope, purpose, or actors behind the threat. We do not know
whether Chenkuo Technology or Aisino are active and/or willing participants or the extent of
their involvement other than what is presented in the report.

Recommendations
We believe that every corporation operating in China or using the Aisino Intelligent Tax
Software should consider this incident a potential threat and should engage in threat
hunting, containment, and remediation countermeasures, as outlined in our technical report
(download link below).
Trustwave SpiderLabs is still actively investigating and seeking out more telemetry on the
GoldenSpy campaign. If you have any information about this activity or feel you may have
been victimized by this attack, please reach out to the Trustwave SpiderLabs Threat Fusion
Team at GoldenSpy@trustwave.com.
We are available for advice, information exchange, or to engage threat hunting / forensic
investigation services.
