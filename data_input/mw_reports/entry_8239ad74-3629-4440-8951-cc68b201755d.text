Kaspersky Labs published a technical analysis of a new malware, Silence that is aimed at
attacking financial institutions. After uploading the loader of this malware to Intezer
Analyze™, we have found a possible connection through code reuse to the loader of
another campaign of malware, Mole previously discovered by Unit 42 of Palo Alto
Networks.
This connection might be an indicator that these two attacks are originated from the same
threat actor, but currently it is too early to tell.

Silence Loader:

Mole Loader: 50117ce3fe5dba572cf23584dc7541a7cfd4026d4316e69d29cdf536873fdf20
If we look at the code of the two loaders used by both campaigns side by side, we can see
that the code is very similar and according to our system is unique to these families of
malware.

Through the disassembly in the photo above, we can also see there is a string initialized
through an array, “RtpEncodePointer,” that is later used for a call to GetProcAddress. This
looks like a typo and the author of the code meant to write “RtlEncodePointer” because
“RtpEncodePointer” does not exist in ntdll.dll. The evidence suggests that this code was
being reused. There are no references to “RtpEncodePointer” available publicly online
besides automated reports of a couple unclassified malware from Hybrid Analysis
In addition to the links within the code, there are several other similarities we have
witnessed between the Mole and Silence malware, such as the attack vectors (spear
phishing, packaging of the malware) and motives — which can be extra evidence for this
connection.
Yet again, we see that identifying code reuse can be very valuable in detecting new
malware, and in some cases for attribution purposes. We invite you to read more of the
