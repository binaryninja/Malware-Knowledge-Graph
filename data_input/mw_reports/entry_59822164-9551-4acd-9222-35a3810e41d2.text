E X ECU T I V E SUMM A RY

PIPEDREAM is the seventh-known Industrial Control Systems (ICS)-specific
malware and the fifth malware specifically developed to disrupt industrial
processes. PIPEDREAM demonstrates significant adversary research and
development focused on the disruption, degradation, and potentially, the
destruction of industrial environments and physical processes.
The Dragos-designated threat group CHERNOVITE developed
PIPEDREAM, which consists of a collection of components. PIPEDREAM
can impact a wide variety of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and
industrial software, including specific Omron and Schneider Electric PLCs,
and poorly configured Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture
(OPC-UA) servers.
One of the Schneider Electric PLCs that PIPEDREAM targets, leverages
CODESYS as its underlying system architecture. PIPEDREAM uses CODESYS
as a key component to abuse due to its lack of security. CODESYS is a
third-party software component used by hundreds of industrial equipment
vendors. While PIPEDREAM can currently identify and target PLCs from
Omron and Schneider Electric, its tooling may be used to target and attack
controllers from hundreds of other vendors. In sum, PIPEDREAM can target
a variety of PLCs in multiple verticals due to its versatility.
Dragos assesses with high confidence that PIPEDREAM has not yet
been employed for disruptive or destructive effects. This is a rare case
of analyzing malicious capabilities before employment of effects against
victim infrastructure, giving defenders a unique opportunity to prepare
in advance. Dragos assesses with high confidence that this capability was
developed by a state-sponsored adversary with the intention to leverage
PIPEDREAM in future operations.

CHERNOV I T E - T H E T H R E AT GROUP
B EHIND PIPEDR E A M

Based on current observations, CHERNOVITE
focuses on manipulating industrial control
systems and can achieve Stage 2 of the ICS
Cyber Kill Chain. As an impact-focused team,
CHERNOVITE would need access facilitated
by other teams to ingress into target
environments.
CHERNOVITE’s observable infrastructure
consists of compromised, adversary-controlled command-and-control
infrastructure. Their activity is expected to shift to a malicious
adversary-controlled domain or webserver. CHERNOVITE is likely to
use service provider infrastructure; however, there are no indications of
current active infrastructure. CHERNOVITE can use target infrastructure
to facilitate interactive operations and lateral movement, access
enablement in an operational technology (OT) environment, and the
manipulation of processes to achieve adversary intent.

WHY ARE WE PUBLISHING THIS?
Threats to industrial infrastructure security are an extremely
sensitive matter. Given the unique realities of industrial
operations, it is often harder for defenders to react than for
adversaries to leverage public information. The more time the
community has to implement mitigations before new malicious
capabilities become public, the better the chance the adverse
effects from any attempted attacks will be reduced.
Dragos identified and analyzed PIPEDREAM’s capabilities
through our normal business, independent research, and
collaboration with various partners in early 2022. Our primary
focus is informing industrial asset owners and operators with
as much information as possible. It is the team’s stance never
to be first to communicate detailed technical insights on ICS
threats and capabilities until the information is already going
to become public; this is done as the information can often be
weaponized and industrial control system (ICS) defenders need
as much time as possible. Once information about threats and
new capabilities are made public, Dragos’s approach is to follow
up with detailed analysis and advice to the security community.
This report was proactively written and readied for release as
the information became public through other avenues.

KEY FINDINGS
Summary of Key Findings:
• PIPEDREAM is a clear and present threat to the
availability, control, and safety of industrial
control systems and processes. PIPEDREAM
can be used to endanger operations and lives.
• PIPEDREAM’s industrial-related components
expose a command-line interface for
manipulating target controllers and OPC-UA
servers.
• PIPEDREAM can execute 36 MITRE ICSATT&CK techniques.
• CHERVONITE can manipulate the speed and
torque of Omron servo motors used in many
industrial applications. This manipulation
can cause disruption or destruction of
industrial processes, leading to potential lossof-life scenarios.
• PIPEDREAM’s Windows-related components
facilitate host reconnaissance, command
and control (C2), lateral tool transfer, and the
deployment of unsigned rootkits.
• CHERNOVITE can leverage PIPEDREAM’s
multiple components to perform rapid
reconnaissance of ICS networks by using a
variety of mechanisms, including:
o Identifying known MAC addresses
o Port numbers
o HTTP banners
o Omron’s proprietary Factory Interface
Network Service Protocol (FINS)

o Remotely interacting with PLCs using
CODESYS to support numerous attacks
like brute-force passwords, performing
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the
controller, and severing connections.
o Remotely interacting with Omron PLCs
through HTTP and Telnet to load a native
implant to support further command
execution.
o Remotely interacting with Omron PLCs
through exposed HTTP endpoints to
change the operating mode (program,
run, etc.), backing up and restoring
configurations, and wiping the PLC’s
memory, among other capabilities.
o Writing arbitrary node attributes on an
OPC-UA server.
• CHERNOVITE can trigger Denial of Control
and Denial of View for operators using
multiple methods.
• CHERNOVITE disrupts operational
technology by subverting and masquerading
within trusted processes.
• CHERNOVITE can significantly extend
time-to-recovery after an industrial incident
by disabling process controllers, potentially
requiring them to be returned to the
manufacturer before reuse.

o Schneider’s custom Discovery broadcast
protocol (NetManage).

• CHERNOVITE can operate across process
and security zones by using PLCs as
network proxies across an OT environment,
potentially bypassing firewalls, DMZs, and
perimeter-based threat detection.

• CHERNOVITE can achieve Develop, Deliver,
Install/Modify, and Execute ICS Attack
portions of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain Stage 2 in
several ways. These are some examples:

• CHERNOVITE can undermine authentication
and encryption inside OT environments by
collecting network traffic from PLCs and
weakening PLC authentication.

PIPEDREAM can also be used to execute attacks against the ubiquitous industrial technologies
listed below.

Modbus TCP

CODESYS

Modbus is a serial communication protocol
developed and published by Modicon® in 1979 for
use with its PLCs. In simple terms, it is a method
used for transmitting information over serial
lines between electronic devices. Modbus later
adopted the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
TCP/IP communications protocols to expand
communications over interconnected networks.
The resulting protocol is now commonly referred
to as Modbus TCP and is one of the most common
ICS protocols.1

With the adaptable CODESYS Control runtime
system, any intelligent device is transformed
into a complete IEC 61131-3 controller. PLC
manufacturers use a toolkit to port the CODESYS
runtime system on their device and turn it into a
CODESYS-compatible IEC 61131-3 PLC.3

OPC-UA
The OPC Unified Architecture (UA), released
in 2008, is a platform-independent serviceoriented architecture that integrates all the
functionality of the individual Open Platform
Communications (OPC) Classic specifications into
one extensible framework.2

Windows
ASRock Motherboard Utility is an all-in-one
utility designed for system updates and
software downloading. It is integrated with a
variety of applications and support software.
ASRock Motherboard Utility provides the latest
BIOS updates and system upgrade software
for users to download. ASRock Inc. is the
world's third-largest motherboard brand and
manufactures both industrial and consumer
computers and hardware.4

PIPEDR E A M SUMM A RY A N A LYSI S
PIPEDREAM is a collection of utilities that includes tools for reconnaissance, manipulation, and
disruption of PLCs, as well as tools for intrusion operations against Windows devices. At the
highest level, the PLC-related components of PIPEDREAM provide the adversary with an interface
for manipulating the targeted devices. Tools in PIPEDREAM can scan for new devices, brute
force passwords and sever connections, and crash the target device. To accomplish these goals,
PIPEDREAM uses several different protocols, including Omron’s proprietary FINS, Modbus, and
Schneider Electric’s implementation of CODESYS. Given the variety of protocols that PIPEDREAM
abuses, CHERNOVITE possesses a breadth of ICS knowledge beyond any of Dragos’s previously
discovered threat groups.

Figure 1 - Mapping for CHERNOVITE/PIPEDREAM MITRE ATT&CK for ICS Techniques

PIPEDREAM utilizes PLC implants to execute untrusted code on the PLC devices themselves beyond
the view of the host-based monitoring found on Windows and Linux assets. Implants could live on
PLCs for years before they are discovered, as only a firmware forensic analysis of a PLC would reveal
the existence of the implant.

PIPEDREAM Utilities Explained
There are a few key design decisions about
PIPEDREAM that indicate CHERNOVITE’s
development team characteristics.

adversary is aware of successful attacks and is
actively seeking to develop a mature capability
to achieve a similar impact.

Both EVILSCHOLAR and BADOMEN are
extensible and modular. This fact suggests that
developers intend to support the tool long term.
They are aware that the toolsets need to adapt
to new operational requirements. In other words,
they may need to be extended for new target
devices. The design is comparable to common red
team tools such as Metasploit and Powershell
Empire. Furthermore, the tools are easy to use,
which means the developers are likely aware
they may need to be used by operators less
knowledgeable than the developers.

The addition of DUSTTUNNEL and LAZYCARGO
to PIPEDREAM indicates that CHERNOVITE
is not only thinking about OT. They are also
thinking about how it can achieve an end-to-end
attack, starting with an IT intrusion, pivoting
into OT, and executing an attack that covers ICS
Kill Chain Stages 1 and 2.

MOUSEHOLE provides an interactive capability
for manipulating OPC-UA server nodes and
the associated devices. MOUSEHOLE is akin
to an upgraded CRASHOVERRIDE and is the
first time Dragos has witnessed a threat group
learning from another threat group, in this case,
ELECTRUM’s attack. This indicates that the

The breadth of knowledge required to develop
these tools indicates that CHERNOVITE is highly
knowledgeable of ICS protocols, devices, and
how to apply this knowledge to achieve an
effect. They likely have a budget for acquiring
devices to test their toolset.
Given these indicators, Dragos
assesses with high confidence
that CHERNOVITE is highly motivated,
skilled in software development methods,
well versed in ICS protocols and intrusion
techniques, and well-funded.

The following is a list of the utilities with their capabilities. It is important to note that while the
adversary could use these tools together, they are not required to be deployed together. PIPEDREAM
should be viewed as a toolkit rather than a holistic attack suite.

EVILSCHOLAR

Suspected Deployment Scenarios
The following provides an example scenario of the deployment of PIPEDREAM components, along
with the possible impact based on Dragos’ analysis of PIPEDREAM malware to date.

PHASE 1: IT NETWORK INTRUSION
CHERNOVITE could deploy DUSTTUNNEL within
an enterprise network through phishing or
compromised remote access. Using DUSTTUNNEL's
command-and-control functions, CHERNOVITE
could drop additional tools such as Mimikatz to
gather credentials to access a legitimate account and
gain a persistent foothold in the enterprise network.
From there, DUSTTUNNEL can allow the adversary
to enumerate the network to locate IT-OT DMZ and
then move laterally using captured credentials. At
this stage, CHERNOVITE may deploy LAZYCARGO

D R AG O S , I N C .

to install a rootkit to protect the established foothold
within the corporate network.

PHASE 2: OT ENUMERATION
DUSTTUNNEL can allow CHERNOVITE to traverse
to operational technology (OT) networks or jump
boxes in the IT-OT demilitarized zone (DMZ).
LAZYCARGO could also be deployed at this stage on
operator stations/Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
to install unsigned device drivers to manipulate
traffic being sent between HMIs and field devices.

12

TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction

WHITEPAPER

PHASE 3: CONTROLLER COMPROMISE
Once in the OT network, CHERNOVITE can
leverage MOUSEHOLE to identify and brute force
authentication to an OPC-UA server. CHERNOVITE
can then enumerate devices on the OT network and
see configurations, with the potential to manipulate
tags and control points. Depending on the identified
plant infrastructure, CHERNOVITE could deploy
EVILSCHOLAR and/or BADOMEN to interact with
Schneider Electric PLCs and Omron PLCs.

PHASE 4: FURTHER COMPROMISE
OF CONTROL NETWORKS

used to pivot into protected network segments
by abusing Schneider Electric controller routing
behavior. This functionality would allow further
enumeration of controllers to be targeted in
Modbus enumeration and exploitation.

PHASE 5: CROWN-JEWEL OBJECTIVES
Capabilities to reprogram and potentially disable
safety controllers and other machine automation
controllers could then be leveraged to disable
emergency shutdown systems, and subsequently
manipulate the operational environment to
unsafe conditions.

DEFENDING AGAINST PIPEDREAM –
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
The Dragos Platform contains several detections for PIPEDREAM activity. Dragos customers employing
the most recent Knowledge Packs can find these detections in the Dragos platform under the Content
tab. Managed service customers can go through OT Watch. Dragos has already searched through
Neighborhood Keeper participants for activity. Asset owners who are not Dragos platform customers
should focus on identifying the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) detailed in this report and
follow the recommended actions to mitigate impacts to your environment in Table 2. Much of the
guidance to the community in the form of standards, frameworks, and regulations heavily focuses on
preventing cyber attacks. This means the community often puts very limited focus on detection and
response. Given the type of threat, it is imperative to be able to detect and respond instead of simply
attempting to prevent access.

Schneider Electric Technology Mitigations
Table 2: Schneider Electric Technology Mitigations
Action

Target

Change default credentials

Where feasible, in conjunction with operations and site personnel for
Schneider Electric TM2xx series PLCs:
Beginning with firmware 5.0, the devices use default credentials'
Administrator’/’Administrator', and these should be changed to a complex
password using the EcoStruxure software.

Restrict access to UDP/1740-1743,
TCP/1105, and TCP/11740.

For all Schneider Electric TM2xx series PLCs

Restrict access to TCP/11740.

For non-Schneider PLCs known to communicate with this port from the
engineering workstation

Disable the Schneider NetManage
discovery service.

In conjunction with operations and site personnel, disable Schneider
NetManage discovery service, as it is used by CHERNOVITE to discover PLCs
(see VA-2019-02).

Monitor affected PLCs for new
outbound connections.

Look for communications to other PLCs on the network, on: UDP/1740-1743,
TCP/1105, and TCP/11740.

Validate the engineering
workstation software EcoStruxure Machine Expert.

Remove unnecessary software. If possible, apply application allow listing
software on the workstation. Restrict the workstation from making outbound
network connections, especially to Internet services.

OPC-UA Mitigations
Table 4: OPC-UA Mitigations
Action

Target

Enable OPC-UA security

Ensure OPC-UA security is correctly configured with application
authentication enabled and explicit trust lists.
Ensure the certificate private keys and user passwords are stored securely.
Ensure mDNS (which actively broadcasts the location of OPC-UA servers) is
disabled on all machines.
ICS operators can manage the security configuration for their OPC-UA devices
using their engineering workstation software (in most cases).
Using "sign-only" security mode with OPC-UA is optimal for ICS environments
that leverage network monitoring solutions (like the Dragos Platform). Signonly security mode sends messages unencrypted but with an authentication
code that allows receivers to be sure the message came from a trusted sender.
This protects against tools like MOUSEHOLE that send unauthorized messages
to OPC-UA clients and servers while allowing the packets to be inspected by
network security devices.
Specific recommendations for OPC-UA security best practices can be found on
the OPC-UA foundation’s website:

OT Best Practices
MONITOR EAST-WEST ICS NETWORKS WITH ICS PROTOCOL AWARE
TECHNOLOGIES
Perform network traffic monitoring with a focus on East-West communications instead of simply NorthSouth (ingress/egress) communications. PIPEDREAM’s ability to move from Engineering Workstation to PLC
and then PLC to PLC means that simply monitoring North-South communications or putting emphasis on
segregation will be insufficient. Specifically look for modifications to PLCs occurring outside of maintenance
periods such as the changing of logic using native ICS protocols.

PLC NETWORK TELEMETRY ANALYSIS
Monitor for unusual interactions with PLCs from non-standard workstations or accounts.

ISOLATE MISSION CRITICAL SKID SYSTEMS
Consider implementing hardwired I/O between critical skid systems and distributed control systems I/O in
place of direct communications if feasible.

NETWORK ISOLATION OF SAFETY SYSTEMS
Ensure network isolation for safety system components, monitor safety system networks for new connections
or devices, and verify all configuration changes are compliant with change management procedures.

Long-Term Readiness
ICS-FOCUSED INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
Create and update an ICS-focused Incident Response (IR) plan with accompanying Standard Operating
Procedures (SOP) and Emergency Operating Procedures (EOP) for operating with a hampered or degraded
control system. Conduct a table top exercise focused on CHERNOVITE’s ICS Cyber Kill Chain with an emphasis
on PIPEDREAM; use this opportunity to identify process and collection gaps that could hinder the detection
and response efforts.

SPARE PARTS INVENTORY
Create and update a spare parts inventory for critical control system components, including hardware,
software, firmware, configuration backups, and licensing information. Develop plans and procedures for
sourcing and procurement of critical control system components. Consider the implementation of cold
backups for rapid replacement of ICS level one devices.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
How significant is PIPEDREAM to ICS/OT
environments?
PIPEDREAM is the seventh-known ICSspecific malware, following STUXNET,
HAVEX, BLACKENERGY2, CRASHOVERRIDE/
INDUSTROYER, TRISIS/TRITON, and
INDUSTROYER2. It is the first-ever known
ICS-tailored malware assessed to be developed
by a state actor to be identified before use for
its intended purpose. New tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTP) based on detections and
awareness will increase the overall security
posture of OT environments, regardless of
whether CHERNOVITE will deploy PIPEDREAM.
What questions should executives ask?
Executives should ask their security teams:
• Do we have Omron, Schneider Electric, or
OPC-UA in our environment(s)? If so, where
and what type(s)?
• If we needed to collect data from the
environment, or validate that the system has
not been modified, could we?
• If the processes that use these devices
or protocols are disrupted, is there a
cybersecurity component in place to
determine root cause analysis and if an attack
has occurred?
• Do we have an incident response plan that
factors in the loss of any of these devices?
What monitoring do we have in place to
ensure it is not impacted?

Could this malware lead to loss of life?
When discussing safety impacts, there must
be a thorough understanding of the specific
environments and how they are configured and
implemented. It is possible to leverage PIPEDREAM
in a wide range of industrial controllers and
environments, meaning that it could also be
leveraged in attacks on safety instrumented
systems (SIS). Should CHERNOVITE reprogram the
safety controller without appropriate outputs, the
safety integrity of the plant would be compromised
and could rely on mechanical fail-safes. However,
PIPEDREAM was found before the adversary could
employ it for their desired effects, so there are no
known targeted environments currently, and the
adversary's goal may or may not be safety focused.
What are the Indicators of Compromise (IOC)?
Dragos recommends that defenders focus on the
TTPs of PIPEDREAM components versus simple
IOCs. Please refer to the mitigations in this paper.
If I do not have Schneider Electric or Omron in
my network, should I care about PIPEDREAM?
Yes, the capabilities are further reaching than
Schneider Electric or Omron vendors. CODESYS
protocol is used in hundreds of controllers far
beyond Schneider Electric and Omron.
Additionally, MOUSEHOLE targets and
compromises OPC-UA servers.
OPC is an interoperability standard for the secure
exchange of industrial automation data. It is
designed to be platform-agnostic so devices from
different vendors can exchange information.

WHITEPAPER

Multiple Industrial Ethernet (IE) protocols in
manufacturing processes and plants — such
as EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, or EtherCAT — are
used across different networks to meet specific
topology requirements and communication
speeds or latency guarantees. Although these
communication protocols are open, they are often
incompatible, resulting in fragmented networks
that cannot “speak” to each other.
OPC-UA was developed to solve this problem by
allowing industrial devices operating with different
protocols and on different platforms (Windows,
Mac, or Linux, for example) to communicate
with each other. OPC-UA goes beyond Industrial
Ethernet in reach, including devices from the
lowest level of the automation pyramid — such as
field devices that deal with real-world data, such
as sensors, actuators, and motors — to the highest
levels, such as Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA), Manufacturing Execution
Systems (MES), and Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) systems, as well as to the cloud.1

What’s the attribution?
Dragos does not make assessments about
attribution. It is Dragos’s position that what is
valuable to a significant majority of defenders
is understanding the “what and how, not who.”
Additionally, given the unique geopolitical
nature of malicious capabilities and operations
targeting critical national infrastructure, it could
be disruptive to security efforts to focus on
attribution.
What could have the original equipment
manufacturers done differently?
The original equipment manufacturers (OEM)—
Schneider Electric and Omron— were targets but
did not do anything wrong. Each time malware
families target ICS, conversations emerge about the
OEM. However, product security is not the same
thing as ICS security. CHERNOVITE takes advantage
of the native functionality available in the industrial
environment and does not rely on vulnerabilities
in the ICS equipment to achieve its operations.
Any focus on the OEMs is misplaced; based on the
Dragos analysis, it is likely that the adversary will
develop modules against numerous equipment
vendors.
