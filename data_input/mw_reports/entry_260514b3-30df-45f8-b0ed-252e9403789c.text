Spamhaus Botnet
Threat Update
Q2 2020
The pandemic certainly didn’t put the brakes on botnet
operators in Q2 2020. After the welcome decrease in activity
at the end of Q1, the research team tracked and listed a 29%*
increase in the number of botnet Command & Controllers
(C&Cs) this quarter.
This increased activity is highlighted across most of our
Top 20 lists, with extensive changes, including numerous
new entries and departures…it’s never a dull moment in
the botnet ecosphere.
Welcome to the Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q2 2020.

What are botnet controllers?
A ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or ‘botnet
Command & Control’ server, is commonly
abbreviated to ‘botnet C&C.’ Fraudsters
use these to both control malware infected
machines and to extract personal and
valuable data from malware-infected victims.
Botnet C&Cs play a vital role in operations
conducted by cybercriminals who are
using infected machines to send out spam,
ransomware, launch DDoS attacks, commit
e-banking fraud, click-fraud or to mine
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

Desktop computers and mobile devices, like
smartphones, aren’t the only machines which
can become infected. There is an increasing
number of devices which are connected
to the internet, for example, the Internet of
Things (IoT) devices, such as webcams, or
network attached storage (NAS). These are
also at risk of becoming infected.

Spotlight

Highlighting networks with the most
active botnet C&Cs
Historically, our Quarterly Botnet Threat Updates have
focused on newly observed botnet Command and
Controllers (C&Cs). In doing so, we can clearly illustrate
the quality of a network’s customer vetting process and
security mechanisms; however, it doesn’t provide insight
into how particular networks handle abuse reports.
Additionally, purely counting new botnet C&Cs enables
“bulletproof” hosting companies to evade listings in our
Botnet Threat Updates; they don’t take down botnet
C&Cs on their network. Therefore, fewer new ones appear.
To address this problem, we will now be including in this
Update, statistics on those networks hosting the highest
total number of active botnet C&Cs.
To produce these figures, we review the number of
total unresolved botnet C&C listings detailed on the
Spamhaus Blocklist (SBL) per network. Realtime data on
these statistics can be accessed 24/7 on the Spamhaus
website: www.spamhaus.org/statistics/networks/

2 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q2–2020

What is bulletproof hosting?
Bulletproof hosting companies
provide domain or web hosting
services that enable their
customers to upload and/or
distribute material that would
not be accepted among
legitimate providers.
Further details on how they
operate can be found here:
www.spamhaus.org/news/
article/792/bulletproof-hostingtheres-a-new-kid-in-town

Number of botnet C&Cs observed,
Q2 2020
In the second quarter of 2020, Spamhaus Malware
Labs identified a total of 3,559 new botnet Command &
Control servers (C&Cs). Out of this total number, 2,701
were under the direct control of miscreants i.e., as a
result of a fraudulent sign-up.
After the first quarter of this year, there was a 57%
decrease in newly observed botnet C&Cs with malicious
control - extremely positive. At the end of this quarter,
figures unfortunately swung back in the opposite
direction, with a 29%* increase.

What is a ‘fraudulent sign-up’?
This is where a miscreant is
using a fake, or stolen identity
to sign-up for a service, usually
a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or
a dedicated server, for the sole
purpose of using it for hosting a
botnet C&C.

Spamhaus Malware Labs has also identified that, over
the past few months, botnet C&Cs appear to be staying
active for an increased duration i.e., it’s taking longer for
them to be shutdown.

Geolocation of botnet C&Cs in Q2, 2020
Let’s take a more in-depth look at where in the world these
botnet C&Cs were hosted. Given the increase in the total
number of new botnet C&Cs, it’s not surprising that all
countries, except China, had an uptick in the number of
botnet C&Cs they were hosting. However, there are some
newcomers to the chart, while other countries improved
and left the Top 20 listing.

Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,
Q2 2020
Credential Stealers
The high volume of credential stealers we had previously
reported in 2019 continued into Q2, 2020.
While we have seen a decrease in malware activity linked
to Lokibot (#1 in Q1) and AZORult (#2 in Q1), we have
seen a substantial increase in the amount of spam emails
distributing another credential stealer: AgentTesla. In
Q2, we saw a rise of 772% in the number of botnet C&Cs
associated with this malware family between Q1 & Q2.
Let’s be honest – that’s one behemoth increase!

What are Credential Stealers?
This kind of malware is used
by bad actors to steal personal
information from a victim’s
computer, including key strokes
(key logging functionality), session
cookies, email addresses, and
also credentials to various online
services, such as email and File
Transfer Protocol (FTP).

QNodeService
A malware family that is new on the scene is
QNodeService. It first appeared in March 20201, and
acts as a download for a malicious script written in the
JavaScript framework Node.js.
Looking at our records, it seems that QNodeService is
the very first malware-as-a-service that is using Node.js.
Using Java + JavaScript comes with a handful benefits
from a threat actor’s perspective, including poor AV
detection rates and multi-OS support.

Departures

Emotet
With no activity tracked for Emotet in Q2, it dropped
off the Top 20 list. However, at the time of writing this
report, we have seen Emotet’s malspam campaigns fire
up, so we suspect Emotet will be reappearing in Q3.

Most abused top-level domains, Q2 2020
Here are the top-level domains (TLDs) chosen
most frequently by botnet operators to host their
infrastructure on. There have been significant changes in
these between the two quarters, with six new entries and
one meteoric rise.

.top & .gq
Having sat in the lower part of the Top 20 List in Q1, .top
has seen an extraordinary 530% increase in Q2 to take it
into second place, behind .com. Another TLD which has
seen huge increases between the two quarters is .gq,
with a 316% increase.

.pw
With a 91% decrease in associated botnet traffic .pw has
dropped from #3 in Q1, to #20 in Q2.

Top-level domains (TLDs) –
a brief overview
There are several different toplevel domains including:
Generic TLDs (gTLDs) – can be
used by anyone
Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) –
some have restricted use within
a particular country or region;
however, others are licensed
for general use giving the same
functionality of gTLDs
Decentralized TLDs (dTLDs) –
independent top-level domains
that are not under the control
of ICANN

.de & .eu
The country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Germany,
.de, has been listed for the first time in our Top 20 list.
New entries
Entering the charts, and not for
the first time, generic top-level
domain (gTLD) .club comes back
at #6. Other new entries in Q2,
2020 are #8 .de , #11 .eu, #15 .uz,
#17 .ai, #18 .cc

Departures
Having ranked #2 last quarter
with 1,151 botnet C&Cs, .la has
dropped off the Top 20 list in Q2,
2020. Also dropping out of these
rankings are .tw, .in, .top, .me, .site.
Great work!

Most abused domain registrars, Q2 2020
When setting up a botnet C&C infrastructure, threat
actors need to decide who they are going to register their
domain with. Registrars can’t easily detect fraudulent
sign-ups; however, domains used for botnet C&Cs don’t
tend to have a long lifespan with well-run registrars.

Namcheap
The US-based domain registrar Namecheap has been in
the #1 spot for a significant length of time.

Enom
Entering the Top 20 at #2, Enom had 419 botnet C&Cs
operating on domains registered to it in Q2.

Highest climbers
NameSilo had a 90% increase in the number of botnet
C&Cs operating on domains registered through them
in Q2, taking them to #3 on the Top 20 List. However,
with an even more considerable increase of 202%, was
Alibaba, moving up #11 in Q1 to #4 in Q2.

Networks hosting the most newly
observed botnet C&Cs, Q2 2020
The hosting landscape is fast-moving. You only have
to regularly look at “The World’s Worst Spam Support
ISPs”2 on The Spamhaus Project’s website to
understand the changing environment. It is therefore
not surprising that there were multiple changes in our
Top 20 listings: 6 networks dropped off our charts,
resulting in 6 newcomers!

selectel.ru
This Russian based hosting company has been present
in the Top 20 for a long time. However, the situation
deteriorated in Q2; we witnessed a 194% increase in new
botnet C&Cs on their network. As a result, selectel.ru has
knocked cloudflare.com off their #1 spot.

cloudflare.com
We are delighted to see that the US CDN provider
Cloudflare improved their abuse situation in Q2, by
reducing the number of botnet C&Cs operating on
their network by 50%. This is a great effort – and we’re
looking forward to seeing this reduce further in the
forthcoming quarter.

namecheap.com
Namecheap, as detailed earlier in this report, is the most
abused domain registrar when it comes to botnet C&Cs.
Sadly, Namecheap also managed to get into the Top 10
list of Networks hosting the most botnet C&Cs in Q2.

tencent.com
The Chinese cloud service provider Tencent was heavily
abused by threat actors over the past two years for
hosting botnet C&Cs. We are very pleased to see that
Tencent dropped out of our Top 20 list in Q2.
We hope that this will be a signal to their rival, Alibaba,
also to improve. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen much
sign of this yet.

resulting in a lower number of new botnet C&Cs on their
networks. As a result, these dropped off the Top 20 list.

Networks hosting the most active botnet
C&Cs, Q2 2020
As mentioned in the “Spotlight” section of this Update,
we are going to be listing network operators with the
highest total number of active botnets on their network
i.e., not only botnets Spamhaus has seen for the first time
this quarter.

ghlc.biz
This network, according to RIPE location in the UK, was
hosting more than 300 active botnet C&Cs by the end of
Q2. This network shows little interest in acting upon abuse
reports, which in turn enables botnet C&Cs to remain
online. Consequently, we currently consider this network
as “bulletproof” and have added it to the Spamhaus Do
not Route Or Peer (DROP)3 List, advising our users not to
accept any traffic to or from this network.

inter-cloud.tech
The situation at inter-cloud.tech is similar to ghlc.biz. This
network rarely takes positive actions in relation to abuse
reports, allowing botnet C&Cs to remain on their network.
As a result, their network ranges (prefixes) are also listed
on Spamhaus DROP.

fink.org
At the end of Q2, we calculated there close to 100 active
botnet C&Cs on this network, mostly associated with
Remote Access Tools (RATs).

Cloud providers
Surprisingly, the two cloud providers Microsoft (Azure)
and Google (Compute Engine) are hosting, compared to
others, a large number of active botnet C&Cs.
Our experience has shown that getting a response
from them on abuse reports is sometimes difficult. This
illustrates one of the reasons why they have a large
number of active botnet C&Cs in their network.
