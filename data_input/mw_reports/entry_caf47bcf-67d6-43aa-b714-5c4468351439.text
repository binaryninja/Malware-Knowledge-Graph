Since grabbing headlines in early May 2021, the ransomware incident impacting Colonial
Pipeline attracted significant attention from both media and information security spaces,
given the scope and impact of the event. While much has already been written and will
continue to emerge as more evidence comes available, lacking from the discussion so far is
a network-centric view of the general behaviors and detection possibilities associated with
ransomware deployment. In this article, Gigamon provides an overview of the event in
question, the behaviors linked to similar ransomware operations, the importance of network
visibility, and possibilities for network detection and monitoring to meet these adversaries
and related malicious activities head-on.

Background

1/10

On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware incident. While all available
information indicates that ransomware impacted only enterprise IT systems for Colonial, the
company preemptively shut down linked industrial control systems (ICS) out of an
abundance of caution. The intrusion and resulting disruption were subsequently linked to a
ransomware variant known as DarkSide. Active since at least August 2020, DarkSide
operates under a “Ransomware as a Service” or “affiliate” model where the group provides
“double-extortion” ransomware services to other entities that execute the actual network
breach and capability deployment. DarkSide then manages negotiations and payment to
both decrypt a victim’s information and to stop the selective leaking of data exfiltrated from
the target network.
While DarkSide-related activity has continued at a relatively steady state since its initial
discovery in 2020, the Colonial Pipeline incident is notable given its disruptive impact. While
neither the first notable cyber intrusion in pipeline systems, nor the first ransomware event on
pipeline infrastructure, Colonial’s preemptive shutdown of critical systems triggered a halt in
their operations. As one of the main arteries delivering refined petroleum products to the
Eastern and Southeastern United States, the disruption induced reactions from panic buying
of gasoline through statements from the White House. Although Colonial was able to begin
restoring operations as early as May 12, 2021, the shock and short-term impacts of the event
were felt across both policymaker and information security circles.

Ransomware Entity Intrusion Tradecraft
DarkSide ransomware impacted multiple victims since discovery in 2020. Yet while this
ultimate payload inducing network disruption (and data theft for extortion) is concerning,
defenders should focus on the preliminary steps enabling ransomware execution rather than
the ransomware family itself. In this respect, given the “affiliate model” through which
adversaries deploy DarkSide, the ransomware variant can be linked to multiple behavioral
profiles.
Multiple vendors provide insight into initial access, entrenchment, and subsequent lateral
movement activity linked to DarkSide deployment. Among the most notable examples are
the following:
Initial reporting from Digital Shadows in September 2020
Cyberreason Nocturnus’ overview of activity in April 2021
Varonis reporting, subsequently updated after the Colonial incident
An overview of recent DarkSide behaviors from FireEye, also after the Colonial incident
Observations from incident response engagements from Sophos
Further analysis from Palo Alto Unit 42
These are all valuable contributions to the discussion concerning DarkSide’s deployment,
and Gigamon highly recommends defenders review these items for awareness and to
become familiar with this threat. Yet all these items largely focus on host-based actions and
2/10

observations, which is unsurprising, as most of the entities in question are involved in hostbased security solutions. In addition to these observations, defenders possess a multitude of
options for tracking behaviors over the network related to DarkSide deployment, as well as
other ransomware operations.

Initial Access Mechanisms
Adversary deployment of DarkSide ransomware is linked to a variety of initial access
mechanisms, as one would expect given that multiple entities relate to its use. Based on a
review of available literature and analysis, Gigamon identifies the following as primary
Darkside affiliate mechanisms to initially breach victim networks:
Phishing activity leveraging malicious attachments
Credential replay attacks against external-facing services, such as Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP)
Use of publicly disclosed exploits against external-facing services, such as
vulnerabilities in externally accessible VPN appliances (including CVE-2021-20016)
While the above represent known vectors linked to DarkSide affiliate operations, the specific
mechanism used to infiltrate Colonial Pipeline is not known at the time of this writing.
Nonetheless, these initial intrusion mechanisms align well with common tradecraft
associated with not only criminal operations (such as ransomware), but also advanced
persistent threat (APT) or state-directed intrusions.
While one specific VPN exploit is called out in research from FireEye, Gigamon assesses
that other, publicly disclosed exploits have also likely been used as part of intrusions leading
to ultimate ransomware deployment more generally. Given the significant increase in
disclosure and subsequent use of exploits targeting external-facing appliances such as VPN
concentrators, network defenders should anticipate rapid moves by a variety of adversaries,
whether related to DarkSide or not, to take advantage of such potential ingress points.

Lateral Movement and Command and Control Activity
Once within victim networks, DarkSide-related intrusions leverage a combination of built-in
system tools (such as “LoLBins”) and publicly or commercially available tools for varying
levels of network communication and functionality. Such items are deployed to both spread
throughout the victim network, as well as to maintain command and control (C2) over any
implants or tools. Examples include:
The Sysinternals remote command execution utility PSExec
Commercially available remote access tools such as TeamViewer
The PuTTY-related application Plink
The commercially available (but frequently pirated or cracked) Cobalt Strike
The publicly available Custom Command and Control (C3) framework
3/10

Network enumeration tools such as ADRecon and BloodHound for mapping victim
Active Directory instances
Tunneling C2 traffic, including RDP, via The Onion Router (TOR) to mask activity
Additionally, adversaries leverage built-in tools such as RDP and Server Message Block
(SMB) connections to enable tool or capability deployment and lateral movement in victim
environments, combined with continuous credential harvesting via tools such as Mimikatz.
At this stage, endpoint-related visibility becomes valuable in assessing an intrusion in many
cases. However, even the best endpoint visibility on its own is insufficient to track, detect,
and monitor elusive adversaries. This is especially the case for internal network movement.
By pairing network monitoring and visibility with robust network security monitoring,
defenders can ensure that all possible avenues for intruder operation are accounted for.
Like the initial access vectors described in the previous section, the lateral movement and
C2 mechanisms identified here are hardly unique to DarkSide deployment. Instead, these
techniques encompass behaviors also deployed by entities ranging from APTs to other,
criminal actors. By establishing monitoring for either external communication linked to the
tools or techniques listed above, or examining internal communication flows for lateral
movement activity, defenders can identify malicious behaviors even when endpoint and
similar visibility can be evaded.

Data Exfiltration
One other component to DarkSide-related operations, along with some other ransomware
families, is the use of “double extortion” to prompt payment. In addition to encrypting data,
victim information is stolen with threat of publication unless payment is made. Identifying
large-scale data exfiltration in progress can be an indicator of imminent disruptive actions,
and if caught in time may allow for defenders to respond quickly to prevent further harm.
Based on reporting from researchers at Red Canary on general trends in this space, as well
as specific observations on DarkSide, the following tools and techniques appear associated
with “double extortion” operations:
Use of cross-platform, free tools such as Rclone or WinSCP
Mega.io-focused tools such as MEGAcmd or MEGAsync
Although not conclusively proven, media reporting indicates at least in the Colonial incident
the criminals leveraged cloud hosting infrastructure, specifically from Digital Ocean, as an
intermediary for data exfiltration as part of this process.
The above behaviors provide a variety of potential detection possibilities. Examples include
simple tracking of large, anomalous traffic flows indicative of large-scale data exfiltration to
use of specific service and destination combinations (such as WinSCP to an Autonomous
System Number (ASN) associated with a cloud provider).

Network Visibility and Monitoring
The mechanisms identified above are not distinct to DarkSide deployment; this provides a
substantial benefit to defenders in that identifying general techniques associated with such
intrusions will enable defensive coverage over a wide number of potential adversaries.
Moreover, given the efforts by DarkSide-related entities (as well as numerous other threats)
to evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions as part of fundamental tradecraft,
bolstering host-centric visibility with robust network monitoring can enable organizations to
detect such operations at multiple phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.
Establishing network visibility and monitoring not only at the network edge but also for
internal network traffic can enable powerful defensive responses covering a variety of
threats. Looking at the behaviors identified in the previous sections, various defense and
alerting mechanisms emerge from initial access through lateral movement and code
execution.

External Monitoring
Monitoring external scanning or authentication brute force activity can be difficult given the
sheer volume of activity from multiple services, malicious actors, and other entities. Yet being
able to differentiate security-significant “signal” from background “noise” is critical in
articulating meaningful, sustainable network defense.
For example, identifying exploit scanning activity, such as for the VPN vulnerability linked to
DarkSide deployment above, may rapidly result in numerous alarms for various commercial
or academic scanners attempting to identify vulnerable instances. Instead of attempting to
chase every single potential vulnerability scan, defenders should seek higher-quality, lowervolume detections to ensure focused and efficient operations.
By viewing network security events not as atomic, discrete objects but as interrelated items
linked through time and execution, powerful possibilities emerge for detection and analysis.
For example, identifying linked activity such as a vulnerability scan of an external-facing
service (or an explicit attempt to exploit that service) followed by scanning or authentication
activity from that victim host to other, internal hosts within the network can flag likely initial
intrusion actions and adversary attempts to expand access. By linking the discrete
observations into a complex, high-confidence analytic of malicious behavior, defenders can
not only ensure response to only high-severity, high-confidence events, but also alert on
tradecraft linked to numerous threat actors.
Similar methodologies apply to credential stuffing, brute force, or guessing activity. Again, a
variety of scanners and other items will likely be engaged in such activity on a daily basis.
But identifying instances of dedicated scanning or brute forcing from a single source, or such
activity followed by anomalous network traffic from the recipient of such activity, can narrow

5/10

observations to likely compromise scenarios. Defenders can then vector resources and
efforts appropriately to these events to initiate incident response operations, minimizing time
to detection and time to recovery.
Other possibilities exist related to specific services and protocols. For example, in DarkSide
operations deploying parties tunnel RDP via TOR in order to mask operations. While evading
attempts to identify external RDP connections, this still requires communication to TOR
nodes. Tracking and identifying TOR nodes and related traffic can serve as a potentially
powerful way to either enable more robust monitoring or, if blocked, reduce network attack
surface. Similarly, and as stated above, by identifying combinations of activity such as
network traffic flows indicative of large-scale data movement or exfiltration to untrusted or
unfamiliar network infrastructure or ASNs, key portions of the “double extortion” model can
be flagged prior to completion.

Internal Network Communication
Network monitoring and defense does not end at the perimeter; to deal with current threats
(whether criminal actors or APTs) such visibility and response must extend to internal
network communications. By leveraging a visibility fabric or deploying dedicated sensors
inside the perimeter to track host-to-host traffic and similar flows, defenders can gain
valuable visibility into adversary behavior that can identify intrusions in progress that
boundary monitoring or EDR solutions otherwise miss.
For example, DarkSide deployment, along with multiple other actor behaviors, frequently
uses credential theft followed by mapping a share over SMB for file transfer, then execution,
via a tool such as PSExec. Identifying the concrete behaviors behind this activity and
establishing alerts when these events are identified in sequence (authentication to host, SMB
share mapped to another host, followed by file transfer of an executable or scripting object to
the newly mapped host) can reveal instances of lateral movement. While it is possible such
actions could identify legitimate system administrator activity, in well-orchestrated
environments such instances can be rapidly dispositioned, while the existence of an analytic
identifying these linked network-specific events can flag actions related to a variety of threat
actors.
Additional opportunities include monitoring of traffic flows and authentication activity, such as
when an adversary deploys legitimate tools such as RDP. In these cases, identifying a
number of attempted or successful authentication attempts from a single host to multiple
hosts inside the network can indicate an adversary attempting to break out of an initial
network foothold. Further visibility, including being able to track precisely what credentials or
user accounts are used, can reveal compromised accounts and other valuable response
information.

6/10

Overall, the goal is to establish a combination of visibility into internal network traffic flows
and combine this with an understanding of adversary tradecraft and operations to produce
high-confidence alerting on observed activity. When paired with external network monitoring
and endpoint defense, network defenders can severely impede adversary operations,
ensuring multiple potential detection points throughout the attacker’s lifecycle.

What Role Does Gigamon Play in Ransomware Defense?
Network Traffic Visibility and Network Detection and Response
While SIEMs and EDRs have increased SOC and incident response (IR) team’s
effectiveness in identifying active infections, visibility gaps to devices, networks, and traffic
remain. The result is that analysts are left in the dark when trying to identify all adversary
activity described across the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
