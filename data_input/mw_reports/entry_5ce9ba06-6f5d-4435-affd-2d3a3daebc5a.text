Threat actors are now installing a new ransomware called 'DEARCRY' after hacking into
Microsoft Exchange servers using the recently disclosed ProxyLogon vulnerabilities.
Since Microsoft revealed earlier this month that threat actors were compromising Microsoft
Exchange servers using new zero-day ProxyLogon vulnerabilities, a significant concern has
been when threat actors would use it to deploy ransomware.
Unfortunately, tonight our fears became a reality, and threat actors are using the
vulnerabilities to install the DearCry ransomware.

Attacks started March 9th

According to Michael Gillespie, the creator of the ransomware identification site IDRansomware, starting on March 9, users began submitting a new ransom note and
encrypted files to his system.
After reviewing the submissions, Gillespie discovered that users submitted almost all of
them from Microsoft Exchange servers.
On March 9, a victim also created a forum topic in the BleepingComputer forums where
they state their Microsoft Exchange server was compromised using the ProxyLogon
vulnerabilities, with the DearCry ransomware being the payload.

Post about DearCry on BleepingComputer forums
After we broke the news about this attack, Microsoft security researcher Phillip
Misner confirmed that the DearCry, or what they call DoejoCrypt, is installed in humanoperated attacks using the new Microsoft Exchange exploits.
Microsoft observed a new family of human operated ransomware attack customers –
detected as Ransom:Win32/DoejoCrypt.A. Human operated ransomware attacks are
utilizing the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to exploit customers. #DearCry

Today, McAfee's Head of Cyber Investigations John Fokker told BleepingComputer that
they are seeing victims in United States, Luxembourg, Indonesia, Ireland, India, and
Germany.

While the detections are still low, Fokker states that the detections are continuing to grow.
AV vendors are currently detecting DearCry using a variety of generic ransomware
detections. Below we have listed the more specific detections:
Ransomware/Win.DoejoCrypt [AhnLab]
Win32/Filecoder.DearCry.A [ESET]
Win32.Trojan-Ransom.DearCry.B [GDATA]
Ransom-DearCry [McAfee]
Ransom:Win32/DoejoCrypt.A [Microsoft]
Ransom.DearCry [Rising]
Ransom/W32.DearCry [TACHYON]
Ransom.Win32.DEARCRY [TrendMicro]
W32.Ransomware.Dearcry [Webroot]

How the DearCry ransomware encrypts computers
MalwareHunterTeam was able to find three samples of this ransomware on
VirusTotal [1, 2, 3], with addition hashes below, all of which are MingW-compiled
executables. The one analyzed by BleepingComputer includes the following PDB path:
C:\Users\john\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\EncryptFile svcV2\Release\EncryptFile.exe.pdb

When launched, the DearCry ransomware will create a Windows service named 'msupdate'
that is started to perform the encryption. This Windows service is later removed when the
encryption process is finished.

The ransomware will now begin to encrypt files on the computer if they match the following
extensions:
.TIF .TIFF .PDF .XLS .XLSX .XLTM .PS .PPS .PPT .PPTX .DOC .DOCX .LOG .MSG .RTF .TEX
.TXT .CAD .WPS .EML .INI .CSS .HTM .HTML .XHTML .JS .JSP .PHP .KEYCHAIN .PEM .SQL
.APK .APP .BAT .CGI .ASPX .CER .CFM .C .CPP .GO .CONFIG .PL .PY .DWG .XML .JPG .BMP
.PNG .EXE .DLL .CAD .AVI .H.CSV .DAT .ISO .PST .PGD .7Z .RAR .ZIP .ZIPX .TAR .PDB
.BIN .DB .MDB .MDF .BAK .LOG .EDB .STM .DBF .ORA .GPG .EDB .MFS

When encrypting files, it will append the .CRYPT extension to the file's name, as shown
below.

DearCry encrypted files
Embedded in each sample of DearCry is a public RSA-2048 key.

Gillespie told BleepingComputer that the ransomware uses AES-256 to encrypt the files and
the RSA-2048 public key to encrypt the AES key. The ransomware will also prepends the
'DEARCRY!' string to the beginning of each encrypted file.

When done encrypting the computer, the ransomware will create a simple ransom note
named 'readme.txt' on the Windows desktop. This ransom note contains two email
addresses for the threat actors and a unique hash, which Gillespie states is an MD4 hash of
the RSA public key embedded in the malware.

DearCry ransom note
For at least one of the victims, the ransomware group demanded a $16,000 ransom.
Unfortunately, the ransomware does not appear to have any weaknesses that would allow
victims to recover their files for free.

Patch now!
According to new data shared by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks with
BleepingComputer, tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers have been patched
over the last three days.
Unfortunately, Palo Alto Networks states that there are still approximately 80,000 older
servers that cannot directly apply the recent security updates.
“I’ve never seen security patch rates this high for any system, much less one as widely
deployed as Microsoft Exchange,” said Matt Kraning, Chief Technology Officer, Cortex at
Palo Alto Networks. “Still, we urge organizations running all versions of Exchange to
assume they were compromised before they patched their systems, because we know
attackers were exploiting these zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild for at least two months
before Microsoft released the patches on March 2.”
All organizations are strongly advised to apply the patches as soon as possible and to
create offline backups of their Exchange servers.
Not only to protect your mailboxes from being stolen but now to prevent them from being
encrypted.
