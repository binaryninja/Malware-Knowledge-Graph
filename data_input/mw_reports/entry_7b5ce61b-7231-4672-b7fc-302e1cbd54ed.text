A threat actor deployed ransomware weeks to months after
compromising the system.
During February and March of 2016, SecureWorks analysts responded to several
ransomware incidents that appear to have been initiated by the same threat group or threat
actor. The analysts determined that the infections did not occur from victims clicking a link or
opening an email attachment, but rather from a threat actor accessing the infrastructure
through an under-managed, Java-based enterprise application platform, performing
reconnaissance of the infrastructure, and then purposefully deploying ransomware to a
number of systems (typically servers) within the infrastructure.
The adversary initially accessed the infrastructure through the JBoss enterprise application
platform. Log analysis revealed use of various versions of the JBoss exploitation tool known
as JexBoss. Figure 1 shows one of the first indicators of compromise discovered in the
JBoss application logs (in this case, JBoss version 6.1.0). At a later stage of the incident, the
threat actor deployed the REGeorg SOCKS proxy.

After gaining system access in one of the incidents, the adversary used the mimikatz tool to
collect credentials and then used the compromised credentials to log into user accounts and
perform additional actions within the infrastructure. The analysts also observed the threat
actor creating a user account named “jboss,” which in most cases was a local administrator
account on the compromised JBoss system.

In several of the analyzed incidents, the adversary then performed reconnaissance of the
infrastructure by downloading, installing, and executing the SystemTools Hyena network
scanning tool. Using appropriate credentials, the threat actor could collect information (e.g.,
installed software, configuration settings, users, groups) from networked systems. The
adversary also used Visual Basic scripts (*.vbs files) to download additional tools, as well as
batch files to automate a number of rudimentary tasks. For example, one batch file was used
to parse a list of system names and ping each with a single packet, creating separate lists for
available and unavailable systems.
Once a list of systems is finalized, the adversary uses several tactics to deploy the Samas
ransomware. SecureWorks analysts located this ransomware in files named samsam.exe
and sqlsrvtmg1.exe. The analysts also found the batch files used to deploy and execute the
ransomware, indications that the threat actor used the PsExec remote process execution
tool, and artifacts that indicate that the adversary used the Remote Desktop Client to connect
to additional systems within the infrastructure.
The victims engaged SecureWorks shortly after files were encrypted because employees
could not access data required for their daily work and operations. In all cases, the adversary
had initially compromised the JBoss server several weeks or several months before
deploying the ransomware. Endpoint security and detection mechanisms such as the
SecureWorks Advanced Endpoint Threat Detection (AETD) service might have detected the
malicious activity before the threat actors encrypted the files.
