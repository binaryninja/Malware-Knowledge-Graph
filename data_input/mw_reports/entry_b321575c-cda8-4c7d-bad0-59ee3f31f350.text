The Link Between AWM Proxy & the Glupteba Botnet

On December 7, 2021, Google announced it was suing two Russian men allegedly
responsible for operating the Glupteba botnet, a global malware menace that has infected
millions of computers over the past decade. That same day, AWM Proxy — a 14-year-old
anonymity service that rents hacked PCs to cybercriminals — suddenly went offline. Security
experts had long seen a link between Glupteba and AWM Proxy, but new research shows
AWM Proxy’s founder is one of the men being sued by Google.

Launched in March 2008, AWM Proxy quickly became the largest service for crooks seeking
to route their malicious Web traffic through compromised devices. In 2011, researchers at
Kaspersky Lab showed that virtually all of the hacked systems for rent at AWM Proxy had
been compromised by TDSS (a.k.a TDL-4 and Alureon), a stealthy “rootkit” that installs deep
within infected PCs and loads even before the underlying Windows operating system boots
up.
In March 2011, security researchers at ESET found TDSS was being used to deploy
Glupteba, another rootkit that steals passwords and other access credentials, disables
security software, and tries to compromise other devices on the victim’s network — such as
Internet routers and media storage servers — for use in relaying spam or other malicious
traffic.

A report from the Polish computer emergency response team (CERT Orange Polksa) found Glupteba
was by far the biggest malware threat in 2021.

Like its predecessor TDSS, Glupteba is primarily distributed through “pay-per-install” or PPI
networks, and via traffic purchased from traffic distribution systems (TDS). Pay-per-install
networks try to match cybercriminals who already have access to large numbers of hacked
PCs with other crooks seeking broader distribution of their malware.
In a typical PPI network, clients will submit their malware—a spambot or password-stealing
Trojan, for example —to the service, which in turn charges per thousand successful
installations, with the price depending on the requested geographic location of the desired
victims. One of the most common ways PPI affiliates generate revenue is by secretly
bundling the PPI network’s installer with pirated software titles that are widely available for
download via the web or from file-sharing networks.

Over the past decade, both Glupteba and AWM Proxy have grown substantially. When
KrebsOnSecurity first covered AWM Proxy in 2011, the service was selling access to roughly
24,000 infected PCs scattered across dozens of countries. Ten years later, AWM Proxy was
offering 10 times that number of hacked systems on any given day, and Glupteba had grown
to more than one million infected devices worldwide.
There is also ample evidence to suggest that Glupteba may have spawned Meris, a massive
botnet of hacked Internet of Things (IoT) devices that surfaced in September 2021 and was
responsible for some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks the Internet has ever seen.
But on Dec. 7, 2021, Google announced it had taken technical measures to dismantle the
Glupteba botnet, and filed a civil lawsuit (PDF) against two Russian men thought to be
responsible for operating the vast crime machine. AWM Proxy’s online storefront
disappeared that same day.

AWM Proxy quickly alerted its customers that the service had moved to a new domain, with
all customer balances, passwords and purchase histories seamlessly ported over to the new
home. However, subsequent takedowns targeting AWM Proxy’s domains and other
infrastructure have conspired to keep the service on the ropes and frequently switching
domains ever since.
Earlier this month, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. dismantled the
“RSOCKS” botnet, a competing proxy service that had been in operation since 2014.
KrebsOnSecurity has identified the owner of RSOCKS as a 35-year-old from Omsk, Russia
who runs the world’s largest forum catering to spammers.

Shortly after last week’s story on the RSOCKS founder, I heard from Riley Kilmer, cofounder of Spur.us, a startup that tracks criminal proxy services. Kilmer said RSOCKS was
similarly disabled after Google’s combined legal sneak attack and technical takedown
targeting Glupteba.
“The RSOCKS website gave you the estimated number of proxies in each of their
subscription packages, and that number went down to zero on Dec. 7,” Kilmer said. “It’s not
clear if that means the services were operated by the same people, or if they were just using
the same sources (i.e., PPI programs) to generate new installations of their malware.”
Kilmer said each time his company tried to determine how many systems RSOCKS had for
sale, they found each Internet address being sold by RSOCKS was also present in AWM
Proxy’s network. In addition, Kilmer said, the application programming interfaces (APIs) used
by both services to keep track of infected systems were virtually identical, once again
suggesting strong collaboration.

“One hundred percent of the IPs we got back from RSOCKS we’d already identified in
AWM,” Kilmer said. “And the IP port combinations they give you when you access an
individual IP were the same as from AWM.”
In 2011, KrebsOnSecurity published an investigation that identified one of the founders of
AWM Proxy, but Kilmer’s revelation prompted me to take a fresh look at the origins of this
sprawling cybercriminal enterprise to determine if there were additional clues showing more
concrete links between RSOCKS, AWM Proxy and Glupteba.

IF YOUR PLAN IS TO RIP OFF GOOGLE…
Supporting Kilmer’s theory that AWM Proxy and RSOCKS may simply be using the same
PPI networks to spread, further research shows the RSOCKS owner also had an ownership
stake in AD1[.]ru, an extremely popular Russian-language pay-per-install network that has
been in operation for at least a decade.
Google took aim at Glupteba in part because its owners were using the botnet to divert and
steal vast sums in online advertising revenue. So it’s more than a little ironic that the critical
piece of evidence linking all of these operations begins with a Google Analytics code
included in the HTML code for the original AWM Proxy back in 2008 (UA-3816536).
That analytics code also was present on a handful of other sites over the years, including the
now-defunct Russian domain name registrar Domenadom[.]ru, and the website website[.]ru, which curiously was a Russian company operating a global real estate appraisal
business called American Appraisal.
Two other domains connected to that Google Analytics code — Russian plastics
manufacturers techplast[.]ru and tekhplast.ru — also shared a different Google Analytics
code (UA-1838317) with web-site[.]ru and with the domain “starovikov[.]ru.”
The name on the WHOIS registration records for the plastics domains is an “Alexander I.
Ukraincki,” whose personal information also is included in the domains tpos[.]ru and
alphadisplay[.]ru, both apparently manufacturers of point-of-sale payment terminals in
Russia.
Constella Intelligence, a security firm that indexes passwords and other personal information
exposed in past data breaches, revealed dozens of variations on email addresses used by
Alexander I. Ukraincki over the years. Most of those email addresses start with some
variation of “uai@” followed by a domain from one of the many Russian email providers (e.g.,
yandex.ru, mail.ru). [Full disclosure: Constella is currently an advertiser on this website].
But Constella also shows those different email addresses all relied on a handful of
passwords — most commonly “2222den” and “2222DEN.” Both of those passwords have
been used almost exclusively in the past decade by the person who registered more than a
5/7

dozen email addresses with the username “dennstr.”
The dennstr identity leads to several variations on the same name — Denis Strelinikov, or
Denis Stranatka, from Ukraine, but those clues ultimately led nowhere promising. And maybe
that was the point.
Things began looking brighter after I ran a search in DomainTools for web-site[.]ru’s original
WHOIS records, which shows it was assigned in 2005 to a “private person” who used the
email address lycefer@gmail.com. A search in Constella on that email address says it was
used to register nearly two dozen domains, including starovikov.ru and starovikov[.]com.
A cached copy of the contact page for Starovikov[.]com shows that in 2008 it displayed the
personal information for a Dmitry Starovikov, who listed his Skype username as “lycefer.”
Finally, Russian incorporation documents show the company LLC Website (web-site[.]ru)was
registered in 2005 to two men, one of whom was named Dmitry Sergeevich Starovikov.
Bringing this full circle, Google says Starovikov is one of the two operators of the Glupteba
botnet:

Mr. Starovikov did not respond to requests for comment. But attorneys for Starovikov and his
co-defendant last month filed a response to Google’s complaint in the Southern District of
New York, denying (PDF) their clients had any knowledge of the scheme.
Despite all of the disruption caused by Google’s legal and technical meddling, AWM is still
around and nearly as healthy as ever, although the service has been branded with a new
name and there are dubious claims of new owners. Advertising customer plans ranging from
$50 a day to nearly $700 for “VIP access,” AWM Proxy says its malware has been running
on approximately 175,000 systems worldwide over the last 24 hours, and that roughly 65,000
of these systems are currently online.

AWM Proxy, as it exists today.

Meanwhile, the administrators of RSOCKS recently alerted customers that the service and
any unspent balances will soon be migrated over to a new location.
Many people seem to equate spending time, money and effort to investigate and prosecute
cybercriminals with the largely failed war on drugs, meaning there is an endless supply of upand-coming crooks who will always fill in any gaps in the workforce whenever cybercriminals
face justice.
While that may be true for many low-level cyber thieves today, investigations like these show
once again how small the cybercriminal underground really is. It also shows how it makes a
great deal of sense to focus efforts on targeting and disrupting the relatively small number of
established hackers who remain the real force multipliers of cybercrime.
