Intelligence Analysts as well as Security Analysts lost a lot of information when
GDPR changed the content of WHOIS information by obscuring claimed registrant
details.
In order to expand some characteristics to help build attacker TTP profiles and do
threat hunting and behavior clustering, some new elements need to be added to the
actor profile whether it is around their infrastructure or assets.
We have started to expand these characteristics in order to make the threat hunters and
Intelligence Analysts job easier to build a profile and we will briefly explain some of the new
attributes and characteristics below.
This explanation is also useful to our users as our concept of a large composite indicator
includes these data points.
The characteristics are:
Domain/Name Server Entropy- Combining information about number of changes, time of
changes and types of changes across Name-Servers for a domain. This is quite a complex
construction and each of the underlying elements is also available separately in our API.
Certain types of changes take on a higher weighting than others when constructing the final
risk score.
Name Server Density- This is simply the number of domains we see hosted on this
nameserver. The nameserver density can be an important factor in tracking particular types
of campaigns. Some examples of that are mentioned in this post about single domain name
servers towards the end of the page.
Name Server Reputation(listed domains in last 30 days/number of domains on name
server) This is a characteristic of recent known malicious activity on a given Name-Server
relative to the number of domains on the Name-Server.
IP Reputation can be divided into contributing factors of:
AS Rank- various forms of this have been available over the years in OSINT this is
just our own variant
to rank the AS numbers by malicious activity.
AS Reputation- simple calculation of recent malicious activity relative to size of the
IP block
AS Takedown Reputation- a complex algorithm to give an impression of how long
malicious items
survive in an IP block

AS Assignment Age- how long this IP has been assigned to this AS Number
AS Size- how many IP addresses in this block
Subnet Reputation- also number of malicious times associated with the IP subnet in
recent time.
IP Density (Number of A records we see on that IP address)
IP History- (Number of listings associated with that IP address in x days)
MX Density
Number of SSL Certs on an IP
Number of reuses of each SSL Cert
Number of WHOIS changes
These can be combined in different ways to conduct research. There are also a number of
starting points for this. For example if you look in the threat feeds available and pick a
worrying indicator that is relevant to your organization, then build a profile based on the
above characteristics plus the more regular characteristics also included in the data. You
can then conduct a search over our non-threat data to see what matches come up that
maybe should be added to a cluster and further investigated or blocked by network
defenders.
IP Diversity
The number of A records associated with a domain over time and how they rotate through
them is trace evidence of attacker process. It can also help distinguish quickly through
different types of Content Delivery Networks.
