FIN6 Cybercrime Group Expands Threat to eCommerce
Merchants
Summary
FIN6 is a financially motivated threat actor group in operation since at least 2015. The group has
compromised multiple point-of-sale (POS) environments using the TRINITY POS (aka FrameworkPOS)
malware. In September 2017, forensic investigations of several undisclosed entities revealed evidence that
FIN6 actors changed to target card-not-present (CNP) data when they could not deploy their malware in
the POS environment. Evidence shows that FIN6 injected malicious code into the merchants’ eCommerce
environment, placing skimming malware on the victims’ checkout pages. Based on Visa Payment Fraud
Disruption’s (PFD) analysis of eCommerce compromises throughout 2018, FIN6’s focus on the CNP
environment has only amplified, suggesting that the cybercrime group has fully incorporated
targeting CNP environments into their criminal methodology.
The majority of eCommerce compromises reported in 2018 involved direct targeting of vulnerabilities
within the eCommerce website itself. As one of the more sophisticated groups targeting eCommerce
merchants, FIN6 brings their POS compromise approach to the emerging threat landscape of CNP
breaches. FIN6 targets companies, using phishing emails in an attempt to infect the targeted victim’s
network. The actors then move through the network to identify POS and eCommerce environments. PFD
assesses that the increased focus of a sophisticated cybercrime group, such as FIN6, on eCommerce
environments is a broader representation of the overall cybercriminal focus on the CNP space.

Recent Activities
At the end of 2018, Visa Payment Intelligence analysts discovered that FIN6 actors targeted multiple high
value eCommerce merchants with malicious documents that contained links to a malicious server that
allowed the execution of PowerShell scripts, granting the attackers direct access to the merchants’
networks. The PowerShell scripts were only present in memory, and did not download additional files to
the user’s machine, making it difficult for the victim to detect. The FIN6 actors were able to utilize this
access to move through the merchant’s networks to access the eCommerce environment, and specifically
the payment servers. A full investigation of these compromises show that the FIN6 actors specifically
targeted the eCommerce networks and did not exploit them opportunistically.

Figure 1 - FIN6 eCommerce Attack Flow
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
Initial Compromise

FIN6 employs a multitude of tactics within the initial phase of their operations. In the most recent
compromises attributed to FIN6, forensic investigators identified the use of malicious documents to infect
victims with malware known as More_Eggs (aka Terra Loader) that is used to launch malicious scripts on
the infected machine.

Maintain Access

FIN6 establishes a foothold within a victim’s environment by leveraging various payloads, such as
components of the Metasploit Framework (e.g., Meterpreter, JSPSPY and CmdSQL), or through a

specialized version of the AMMYY remote administration tool (RAT) known as FlawedAmmyy. In the most
recent cases, attackers then establish persistent access to the victim’s network using Meterpreter related
code, allowing the attackers to maintain a remote connection to the infected system.

Internal Reconnaissance

FIN6 uses legitimate publicly available tools to map the internal network and conduct reconnaissance.
During the reconnaissance phase, the actors gather information on systems running SQL Database Server
instances and dump schemas for multiple databases and SQL user accounts. The actors also target
network credentials using a malware family known as Stealer One (see below in the section Technical
Analysis and Indicators of Compromise). Additionally, FIN6 employs legitimate administrative tools, such as:

•
•
•
•

Microsoft's built-in SQL querying tool (osql.exe)
Query Express (a free, portable graphical SQL client)
AdFind (a free command-line tool for querying Active Directory)
ProcDump (a Microsoft SysInternals command-line utility used to perform analysis of running
processes).

Escalate Privileges

Once FIN6’s accesses are established with preferred backdoors, they use additional public utilities, such as
Windows Credentials Editor and Metasploit-related tools, for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.

Move Laterally/Maintain Presence

Capitalizing on data acquired via internal reconnaissance, FIN6 relies on credentials stolen from various
systems (e.g. usernames and password hashes) for lateral movement. Investigations show that FIN6 relies
on PowerShell scripts and Meterpreter based shells to maintain access to and move laterally through the
network (see below in the section Technical Analysis and Indicators of Compromise).

More_Eggs Network IOCs
In addition to the C2 information provided, which can change, below are some network IOCs that can be
used to detect More_Eggs beaconing out of the network:
Connectivity Check
The malware checks network connectivity by sending an HTTP HEAD (GET in some new
versions) request to the following legitimate URL:

•

hxxp://www[.]w3[.]org/1999/XSL/Format

Sleep Function
The malware issues an HTTP GET request to the following Google public DNS IP, which takes a
few seconds to complete, causing the program to pause its activity temporarily. This is used as a
method to avoid detection, by delaying further exploitation:

Recommendations & Additional Resources
Visa recommends clients take the following actions to mitigate against these threats:
•

Institute recurring checks in local networks for IOCs provided in this report.

•

Verify the implementation of required security patches: Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI DSS) requires that all system components and software are protected from known
vulnerabilities by installing security patches. Visit the Payment Card Industry Security Standards
Council (PCI SSC) website for more information.

•

Regularly scan and test eCommerce sites for vulnerabilities or malware. Hire a trusted
professional or service provider with a reputation of security to secure the eCommerce
environment. Ask questions and require a report of what was done. Trust, but verify the steps
taken by the company you hire.

•

Consider using a fully-hosted checkout solution where customers enter their payment details
on another webpage hosted by that checkout solution, separate from the merchant’s site. This is
the most secure way to protect the merchant and their customers from eCommerce skimming
malware. Hosted checkout forms embedded inline on the merchant’s checkout page, such as Visa
Checkout, are another secure option.

•

Use a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) validated third-party service
provider to store, process or transmit cardholder data. Criminals commonly target merchant
websites that process payment data. When merchants use a validated and secure service provider,
risk exposure for CNP fraud and compromise decreases. A list of validated, registered service
providers is available on the Global Registry of Service Providers.

•

Comply consistently with industry security standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS), including the PCI Best Practices for Securing e-Commerce, January

2017.

•

Set up a Web Application Firewall to block suspicious and malicious requests from reaching the
website. There are options that are free, simple to use, and practical for small merchants.

•

Limit access to the administrative portal and accounts to those who need them.

•

Require strong administrative passwords (use a password manager for best results) and enable
two-factor authentication.

•

Regularly ensure shopping cart, other services, and all software are upgraded or patched to
the latest versions to keep attackers out.

•

Monitor for suspicious activity—create and regularly check logs and receive alerts if changes to
the site are made.

•

Ensure staff are trained in security best practices and follow the designated procedures.

If a merchant suspects a compromise, they should contact their acquiring bank immediately for guidance
on next steps and to ensure compliance with all Visa investigation and compliance guidelines. For more
information, refer to the What to Do If Compromised (WTDIC) guide.
