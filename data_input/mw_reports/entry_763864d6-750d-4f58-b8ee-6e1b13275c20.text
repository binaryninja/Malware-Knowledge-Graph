SoW (Story of the Week) publishes a report summarizing ransomware’s activity on the
Darkweb. The report includes summary of victimized firms, Top 5 targeted countries
and industrial sectors, status of dark web forum posts by ransomware operators, etc.

Executive Summary
Compared to SoW 5 months ago (W1 Jan), the number of victimized firms increased
by about 2.6 times, and the ransomware threat groups increased by 1.6 times,
requiring attention to ransomware attacks.
The United States was mostly positioned at top in terms of the rate of victim infection,
but as the number of active ransomware threat groups increased, the percentage of
victimized firms’ country locations also varied.
Users who worked as affiliate partners with Darkside (as a pentester) claiming to the
admin of XSS forum as Darkside did not pay their portion properly, which accepted and
permanently suspended the Darkside account.
Babuk ransomware rebranded as Payload Bin and their first victim was CD PROJEKT.
The CD PROJEKT’s source code leak is an incident found to be related to HelloKitty
ransomware as Babuk ransomware announced last week planning to integrate a
platform by gathering ransomware partners who did not operate their own data leak
site.

A. Darkside permanently banned from XSS forum

On May 14th, the user (qwety1) of the XSS Forum claimed to the admin that the user did not
receive any amount working as a pentester participating with the affiliate program of
DarkSide Ransomware.

6/13

The administrator of the XSS Forum mentioned they begin the procedure for paying
compensation with the rule of XSS Forum as below.
return to the victims occurs from the balance, dividing proportionally between the
victims in a% ratio. Consideration of the return process takes place directly in
black, within 7 days .

The administrator started reviewing proofs for 6 asserting users of participated in Darkside
ransomware affiliate program. After that, 3 users were confirmed and compensated its loss
by admin.

XSS.IS adminThanks to all. The question is closed.darksupp(Darkside ransomware's
Operator) - the status is set. But I want to emphasize that the status is set purely
on a formal basis.Appeared faded> there was a "cut" of the deposit> the status is
set. This is the observance of the procedure, nothing more.Since I do not know
anything, I am not ready to take responsibility for any loud statements and will not
hang labels.My job is just to follow the rules honestly, clearly and correctly.

As a consequence, Darkside is banned by administrator violating the forum policy as a
scammer.

B. Babuk ransomware rebranded as Payload[.]bin

8/13

Last week, we covered a post where the Babuk ransomware launch an integrated platform
gathering partners who don’t have a data leak site, and operate them instead. On May 31,
the Babuk ransomware rebranded as Payload Bin and re-organised the homepage.

All leaks data previously disclosed by the Babuk ransomware disappeared with renewal but
CD Projekt’s source code data. The CD PROJEKT’s source code leak is an incident found to
be related to HelloKitty ransomware on Feb 9.

9/13

Ransomware damage announced by CD Projekt

10/13

Ransom note released by CD Projekt via Twitter

After the announcement, there was a user looking for the leaked data regarding CD Projekt’s
incident.

11/13

However, there wasn’t any free sharing page on DDW, rather a seller appeared trying to sell
the source code of CD Projekt on DDW as a form of auction.

As Babuk announced, the data appears to be CD Projekt’s data which was stolen by
HelloKitty ransomware regarding previous incident, and they seem to be partnered with
Babuk ransomware now rebranded as Payload Bin.

Conclusion
12/13

The number of victims mentioned on data leak site operated by ransomware is rapidly
increasing compared to 5 months ago, so it needs to be vigilant
Babuk ransomware rebranded as Payload Bin, appears to strengthen its strategy of
threatening victims by focusing on exfiltrating the data by partnering with the previously
active ransomware groups who did not have their own data leak page.
