While there has been small increase in use of

• Recorded Future observed an average of a

to those families can identify how many intrusions get caught
and potentially how many events remain unknown in the public
domain. Measuring the tempo of server creation can provide
insight into forthcoming surges or drawdowns of activity. Finally,
collection can provide novel indicators and intelligence otherwise
unavailable in the public domain.

A Note on Collection Bias
Recorded Future collects information about C2 servers
based predominantly on traits from known malware families
and their server-side software. The nature of this collection
through passive and active internet scan data will be focused
on collecting known command and control frameworks and their
derivatives or support infrastructure. Recorded Future cannot
verify an IP address to be a C2 server without proof of malicious
activity of at least one of the servers in a given family. Therefore,
we will be biased in reporting servers of known threats and have
a collection bias towards those servers. These should not act as
a replacement for identifying anomalies or detecting odd traffic
inside a network.

IcedID (BokBot)
Unlike other botnets, IcedID does not openly track its clients
or users, although we believe its developers operate under an
affiliate model. IcedID infrastructure is also less mature in its
operational security, continuing to use the same pool of servers
for its operations despite the publication of methods to ID the
servers. Although IcedID effectively generates infections, it does
not display the same level of operational security as the other
families mentioned.

Emotet
Emotet’s return has rightly caused concern among security
researchers. Within 24 hours of new Emotet samples being
loaded by TrickBot, the botnet began spamming. Within a week,
a second branch was established to service more global spam
operations. There have been 40 positively identified Emotet
C2s derived from the samples across both epochs, with an
additional 45 servers that share server patterns that will likely
be used as Tier 1 servers by Emotet. There have been at least
4 servers observed hosting both Dridex and Emotet Tier 1
controller software. While the total count is not greater than
other botnets mentioned here, the infrastructure creation rate
indicates the operators have ambitions to return Emotet to its
former prominence and power.

Digital Ocean, operating out of the United States, hosted
the most C2s of any of the ASNs observed by Recorded Future.
They accounted for 968 individual C2 servers (7.1%). The most
commonly observed family on Digital Ocean was Cobalt Strike,
with 167 servers identified. The next largest was Choopa LLC
(recently renamed the Constant Company), a Virtual Private
Server provider operating out of the US, while the owner of the
most C2s observed in 2020 (Amazon.com Inc.) dropped to third
in 2021.
While these hosting providers accounted for the largest
number of C2 servers, the C2 servers represented a minuscule
percentage of total number of servers under their jurisdiction.
The table below highlights the 10 providers with the highest
percentage of C2 servers compared to their total holdings. This
estimate is based on the number of IPv4 prefixes announced by
the AS, compared to confirmed C2 servers observed in 2021.
Some of these providers, such as Media Land LLC, can
be categorized as bulletproof hosting providers and are being
marketed on underground forums. These providers also had
much more diverse malware hosting than the largest volumes
seen above, including AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, a server-side
component typically used to administer ShadowPad infections.

regular recycling of infrastructure, and the use of more resilient
traffic encryption methods.
We also believe that similar methods will be employed by
Cobalt Strike users, to protect Team Servers from the prying eyes
of researchers. This will likely result in the dropping of traffic from
known scanning engines and the use of redirects to mask the
location of the Team Server (or other C2 nodes). This trend has
likely already begun; BlackBerry’s findings based on extracting
configurations and internet scanning, identified roughly twice as
many Team Servers as scanning alone. As internet scanning has
become table stakes for intelligence providers, adversaries and
red team operators have taken notice. We believe this is due to
improved insulation of the Team Servers.
Finally, we expect the C2 environment to continue to diversify.
As new malware families and C2 frameworks are released, we
anticipate a portion of them will be aware of threat intelligence
measures to scan and detect their servers. This will likely
lead to partially decreased efficacy for threat intelligence
scanning efforts in the short term but will result in new creative
methodologies in the medium to long term. The detection catand-mouse game will continue, with both sides continuing to
innovate to thwart the other.

• Keep systems and software up to date and have a
reliable and tested backup method.
• Exposed RDP servers are abused by threat actors to
gain initial access into a target’s network. If remote
access solutions are crucial to daily operations, all
remote access services (such as Citrix or RDP) should be
implemented with multi-factor authentication.
• Password-protect sensitive files using strong, complex
passwords.
• Detection in Depth
• Proactive detection creates an advantage for defenders,
giving them preparatory time to ensure additional fileand network-based detections are in place.
• Employ detection-in-depth for common open-source
tooling via correlation searches and Sigma queries in
SIEMs for suspicious behaviors, YARA for suspicious file
contents, and Snort for suspicious or malicious network
traffic.
• The detections for each family show the increased use of
open-source tools beyond just the families that get major
publicity. Prioritize these families for network and hostbased detection in enterprise environments.
• External network detections are only part of the
detection equation; detection-in-depth methodologies,
such as calculating the standard deviation of beaconing
intervals or using YARA for memory inspection, can aid in
the identification of malicious activity.
