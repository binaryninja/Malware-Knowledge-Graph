A new open-source ransomware project uploaded on GitHub as a "proof of concept," has
now spawned three new ransomware families that are infecting users in real-life.

1/10

The original CryptoWire project was uploaded to GitHub by an anonymous user this past
May.
The project, still available for download, contains a ZIP archive, with the ransomware's
source code, and a README file advertising CryptoWire's capabilities.

Contents of the CryptoWire package
According to its author, the ransomware is written in the AutoIt scripting language and locks
files stored on network drives, network shares, USB drives, external disks, internal disks,
and cloud storage apps running on the machine such as Onedrive, Dropbox, Google Drive,
and Steam.
CryptoWire uses the AES-256 algorithm for the encryption operations, which will encrypt all
files smaller than 30MB (adjustable limit). The README file might have been outdated, as
the ransomware's source code included file extension filters (pictured below).

The README claims the encryption process makes a copy of the targeted files, encrypts
the copy, overwrites the original file ten times, and then permanently deletes its.
After the encryption process ends, CryptoWire will delete all shadow volume copies, and
overwrite the content of the RecycleBin ten times and permanently delete it.
When displaying the ransom note, CryptoWire will check if the infected target is part of a
domain and multiply the ransom demand by 10 (adjustable value).
CryptoWire's author said it shipped the ransomware without a backend panel "to prevent
skids from abusing it." Unfortunately, skids abused it.

Real-life CryptoWire spawns
The first CryptoWire spawn was detected at the end of October by GData malware analyst
Karsten Hahn, using the same name: CryptoWire.
This version appears to have been under development, as one crucial button for the
decryption process was missing from its interface.

CryptoWire variant, October 2016
A month later, security researcher S!Ri discovered the Lomix ransomware, pictured below.

Lomix ransomware, November 2016
Today, the same Karsten Hahn has come across another CryptoWire variant that goes by
the name of UltraLocker and spreads a spam campaign delivering malicious Word files.

UltraLocker ransomware, December 2016
The problem of open-source and so-called "educational" ransomware has been discussed
in the past numerous times. Previous open-source ransomware families included Hidden
Tear, EDA2, CryptoTrooper, and Heimdall.
In all cases, the authors of these projects have hidden from any responsibility and damage
their code would have caused just by using words as "educational" and "proof of concept,"
not realizing that real-life malware coders don't care.
Most crooks look at open-source ransomware as free work, and hours of work they don't
have to put in designing, documenting, and writing their own code. How about we stop
giving crooks a helping hand, shall we?

Or alternatively Catalin, why don't we not stop "helping" crooks? I see the points
you're making, and they are concise and accurate, but on the other hand: Do you not
feel that the masses need education, on all topics? Understandable that so-called
crooks are going to try and repurpose these types of software, why would they not?
However, this is a byproduct of education, we have schools that teach people about
bombs, why do they not get told to stop helping the crooks? People can utilize this
knowledge for very good purposes, like all things. I strongly feel that these open
source ransomware's popping up periodically could turn out being more beneficial, if
more people familiarize themselves with the concepts, two things could potentially
happen. 1) People are going to garnish more awareness on security issues such as
these and having a working proof-of-concept will make it easier to educate people
who are misinformed. 2) More knowledge of ransomware in general is made possible
by this. Would it not be great, if encryption as it is became a common understanding
and the issues like ransomware would go away? Think of the possibilities if everyone
was capable of decrypting their files following a ransomware infection? Also, the socalled crooks utilizing open-source software, are DEFINITELY not the ones that are
going to be causing serious damages... Of course though, I do see your point on the
matter, but this is just another take on that.

"Also, the so-called crooks utilizing open-source software, are DEFINITELY not the
ones that are going to be causing serious damages..."
Have you ever had a look at the forums for the help request to all the
HiddenTear/EDA2 variants? They are causing major damage to people and
organizations.
Me and some of my colleagues have written articles about that matter, because it is
discussed a lot lately. If you are interested in our reasoning, you might want to read
that: https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/2016/11/29289-it-s-educational-on-the-no-1argument-for-open-source-ransomware

Certainly I will have a read through your publication. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying
to say "my way or the highway". I just see the value in learning this kind of stuff.

HiddenTear/EDA2 or CryptoWire...
It's like, what produce grenades, bombs and deadly weapons, and then cry out for
mercy.
If you made a bombshell, If put it in the wrong hands - it will fly and explode, what to
cause injury and death.

Uselesslight - 5 years ago

That is kind of my point Amigo-A, everything that has ever been created, ever has the
potential of being misused. It's going to exist one or another though, there is nothing
we can do, at this point the lesser of two evils is to embrace it and learn as much as
we can. The only hope we have against ransomware it seems is education now.
