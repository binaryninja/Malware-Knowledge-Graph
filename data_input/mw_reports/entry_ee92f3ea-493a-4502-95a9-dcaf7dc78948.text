A Russia-linked threat actor tracked

as TAG-53 is running phishing campaigns impersonating various defense, aerospace, and
logistic companies, according to The Record by Recorded Future. Recorded Future’s Insikt
Group identified overlaps with a threat actor tracked by other companies as Callisto Group,
COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM.
“TAG-53 infrastructure was uncovered by analyzing specific combinations of domain
registrars, autonomous systems, domain name structures, and related TLS certificates,” the
researchers write. “Based on this information, it is highly likely that this threat group is
continuing its phishing and credential-harvesting operations. While monitoring TAG-53
infrastructure, Insikt Group observed a spoofed Microsoft login page masquerading as a
legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the US, suggesting that some TAG-53
infrastructure has likely already been operationalized.”

Recorded Future isn’t sure if the impersonated entities are the specific targets of the
operation, but the researchers note that most of these organizations “share a focus around
industry verticals that would likely be of interest to Russia-nexus threat groups, especially in
light of the war in Ukraine.”
“The TAG-53 domain “drive-globalordnance[.]com” includes a spoofed sign-in page for the
legitimate company Global Ordnance, a military weapons and hardware supplier in the US,”
the researchers write. “The spoofed sign-in page…uses Global Ordnance branding and is
suspected to be used for follow-on credential harvesting after a target has been phished. It is
unclear whether Global Ordnance is the intended target of this attempted credential
harvesting operation or whether TAG-53 is using a Global Ordnance-styled domain and
spoofed sign-in page to masquerade as a legitimate entity to target victims.”
Other impersonated entities included Polish defense company UMO Poland, the nonprofit
Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), US-based satellite
communications company Blue Sky Network, logistics company DTGruelle, and Russia’s
Ministry of Internal Affairs.
