Editor’s Note — August 19, 2020: The Elastic Endpoint Security and Elastic SIEM
solutions mentioned in this post are now referred to as Elastic Security. The broader Elastic
Security solution delivers endpoint security, SIEM, threat hunting, cloud monitoring, and
more.
Today we are excited to announce the introduction of Elastic Endpoint Security, based on
Elastic’s acquisition of Endgame, a pioneer and industry-recognized leader in endpoint
threat prevention, detection, and response based on the MITRE ATT&CK™ matrix. Elastic
is combining SIEM and endpoint security into a single solution to enable organizations to
automatically and flexibly respond to threats in real time, whether in the cloud, on-premises,
or in hybrid environments. Also announced today, Elastic is eliminating per-endpoint pricing.
“Two key trends in endpoint security — the importance of a strong analytics back-end and
the rise of the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a lingua franca — help make the case for
greater emphasis on threat hunting and incident response use cases,” said Fernando
Montenegro, Principal Analyst at 451 Research. “Elastic’s acquisition of Endgame fits well
within these trends, and the combination of SIEM and endpoint security should enable
organizations to pursue efficiencies around those use cases.”

Endgame has been validated by numerous independent testing organizations, including
NSS Labs, SE Labs, MITRE, and others as having both the strongest preventions and
detections available. This was recently illustrated by its performance in the AV
Comparatives Independent Anti-Virus Test, where Endgame demonstrated exceptional
protection against real-world threats, preventing 99.7% of malware with no cloud
connectivity required.
Additionally, Elastic Endpoint Security brings one of the strongest sources of endpoint
security data, raw endpoint event data, and alerts to the Elastic Stack, joining the existing
logging, security, APM, and infrastructure event collection. With the average threat dwell
time exceeding 100 days, shipping, scaling, and storing data efficiently in Elasticsearch
makes searching through all of this disparate security-related data practical, easy, and fast.
Accordingly, endpoint security is a natural fit for the Elastic Stack to provide prevention
against threats and the fastest detection and response to stop attacks at the earliest stages
possible.
“Users deserve more from the tools they deploy. That’s why we are providing immediate
value today through the simplicity of a single stack to search, store, analyze,
and secure your data,” said Shay Banon, founder and chief executive officer of Elastic.
“This is an exciting step toward realizing our vision for applying search to multiple use
cases, as we are now able to offer users the best threat hunting solution with the best
endpoint protection.”

Our journey into SIEM and endpoint security

Tools working in isolation can’t safeguard an organization, and the data that those tools
collect isn’t actionable without a centralized management console. Security teams are faced
with siloed data, slow query times, and compromised analysis that lacks relevance and
context. Organizations already know they need to work in real time; they need to ingest and
store all types of data in a way that is unbounded; and they need to produce relevant results
and automatically operationalize them into existing and new security workflows.
Nearly two years ago, we embarked on a mission to help organizations evolve their security
efforts. While the Elastic Stack has been adopted and is used as a security solution for use
cases like threat hunting, fraud detection, and security monitoring, we wanted to make it
even easier for users to deploy our products for security. We first worked in collaboration
with our community to develop the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) to provide an easy way
to normalize data from disparate sources from network and host data. Then we launched
Elastic SIEM, the world’s first free and open SIEM... but we didn’t stop there.
Now, when you deploy a data collection agent for Elastic SIEM, you can protect the
endpoint simultaneously and remove the inefficiency of multiple solutions that can’t respond
in time to prevent damage and loss.
“Stopping attacks as early as possible is the goal. That requires the best preventions and
the highest fidelity detections on the endpoint. The combination of Endgame’s leading
endpoint protection technology with Elastic SIEM creates an interactive workspace for
SecOps and threat hunting teams to stop attacks and protect their organizations,” said Nate
Fick, formerly CEO of Endgame and now general manager of Elastic Security.

The end of endpoint pricing

In addition to combining the world’s first free and open SIEM with the best endpoint
protection technology, Elastic is eliminating per-endpoint pricing.
“Why should users need to count the number of devices they need to protect? Or choose
how many days of threat intelligence data they can afford to retain?” added Banon. “We
want organizations to have the best protection, use it everywhere, and not be penalized
with per-endpoint pricing.”
Elastic customers pay for resource capacity for any solution they use — Elastic Logs, APM,
SIEM, App Search, Site Search, Enterprise Search, and now Endpoint Security — with a
consistent and transparent pricing framework. This ensures organizations can capture
maximum value from their data. With Elastic Endpoint Security, customers get full protection
for as many endpoints as they need, and full data collection and shipping without having to
compromise.

Security leaders comment on Elastic Endpoint Security
Texas A&M University, Andrew Stokes, Assistant Director and Information Security
Officer
“We value speed of response and the ability to learn from and analyze our historical data.
Elastic Endpoint Security has dramatically dropped our mean time to remediate from seven
days to 30 minutes over legacy antivirus, and the Elastic Stack has provided an
unparalleled way to store, analyze, and react to data well beyond any competitor in the
market. Combining Elastic Endpoint Security and the Elastic Stack into a single,
intelligence-led platform will further simplify and automate our security operations.”
Optiv, Anthony Diaz, Divisional Vice President, Emerging Services
"Elastic is bringing together the integration of a next-generation SIEM, robust visualization
engine and a best-in-class endpoint product all backed by the world's leading search
technology. This combination provides a foundation for enterprises to combat the growing
complexity of cyber threats. Elastic's vision for bringing together these components in an
open ecosystem is a revolutionary, yet practical idea that helps organizations of all sizes
maximize all of their data to manage their cyber security needs."
Infotrack, Sebastian Mill, Chief Technology Officer, Global Development
“At InfoTrack, we’ve come to realize just how valuable endpoint data can be for gaining
visibility into our operations and making sure our infrastructure remains secure. Toward
these goals, our innovation team has already been scoping Auditbeat into our
environments, but introducing Elastic Endpoint Security takes it to a whole new level. We

are intrigued by the ability to stop threats with Elastic Endpoint Security while pairing
security event data with some Elastic machine learning-powered anomaly detection. It will
be a killer setup."
SANS Institute, John Pescatore, Director, Emerging Security Trends
“When SANS surveyed SOC managers about the tools they wish new SOC hires were
skilled in the Elastic (ELK) Stack was one of the top ones mentioned. The components of
the ELK stack are used both by SOC analysts and application developers. Having strong
EDR capability integrated into the endpoint side of the standard packages deployed by
DevOps and CI/CD pipelines can be a real game changer in visibility, detection and
prevention of cyber attacks.”
