Executive Summary
In May 2021. The United state’s company was infected by the Suncrypt ransomware,
and after a long negotiation of about 3 weeks, the victim paid the ransom with Bitcoin,
and Suncrypt finally deleted the leaked data and informed security report, and the
negotiations were finished.
As a result of tracking the Bitcoin paid by the victim, it was sent to the Binance, OKEX,
Huobi exchange and confirmed the circumstances of ChipMixer Mixing.

Detailed analysis
1. About Suncrypt ransomware
Suncrypt is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) that uses a closed affiliate program on
the dark web and first appeared in October 2019.
Suncrypt says “The Suncrypt group is a huge fan of a Win-Win style of negotiations
and the minimal damage policy” and they provide a security report when the
negotiation is complete, emphasizing that they are a reliable “business” rather than a
ransomware “hack”.

2. Analysis of Suncrypt Ransomware Negotiation
Suncrypt ransomware left a HTML type ransom note on the infected PC with
information on key points and how to access the 1:1 negotiation page.

In May 2021, an American company D was infected with the Suncrypt ransomware.
On the 1:1 negotiation page, Suncrypt said that after 72 hours the exfiltrated data will
be posted at our news website and DDoS attack will be stopped only after progress is
made in the negotiation.
Suncrypt requested 1,200,000 USD as a payment amount, presenting sample files and
listings as proof and guaranteeing to provide the following three items upon completion
of the negotiation.

3.
Suncrypt seems to have separate roles of negotiator and technician, as a person who
appears to be a technician/developer who calls himself Tech (purple chat) participates
in the negotiation.

During the negotiations, the victim company gave a link to a posted on Marketo /
Twitter and protested why they were already selling our data.
Suncrypt said and denied it had nothing to do with us.

Marketo is a marketplace of stolen data, first appeared in April 202.
Leaked data is selling publicly by bidding auctions.

3/8

Selling leak data of victim companies uploaded to Marketo.

4/8

Since the victim company does not have files encrypted with extensions other than
Suncrypt, it seems that Marketo only stole data without separate encryption, and it is
possible that leaked by Suncrypt and Marketo both.
Suncrypt’s Tech said that they start DDoS attack to Marketo.

After several price negotiations, the victim company paid 182,000 USD, demanding
even to delete the post on Marketo.

Suncrypt closes the negotiation by providing erasure log and security report after
confirming Bitcoin deposit.
Security Report — same contents are provided in case of other victim company that were
infected at around the same time

— erasure logs to prove that Suncrypt has deleted all files stolen from the victim
company.

5/8

Suncrypt said that we are trying to bring down the fake post or getting a proof that data
is fake, but leak data posted on Marketo have not yet been deleted and are still on
selling.
