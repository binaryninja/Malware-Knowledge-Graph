Unrelated to the CCleaner attack, Avast also found ShadowPad samples active in South
Korea and Russia, logging a financial transaction
Today, I shared new findings from Avast’s continued investigations of the CCleaner APT
(Advanced Persistent Threat) at RSA.
Last September, we disclosed that CCleaner had been targeted by cybercriminals, in order
to distribute malware via the CCleaner installation file. The modified installation file was
downloaded by 2.27 million CCleaner customers worldwide. Thereafter, our threat
intelligence team has been investigating what happened.
Since the update we gave at SAS last month, we have made further discoveries about how
the attackers infiltrated the Piriform network and the tactics they used to fly under the radar.
As we looked for similarities with other attacks, we also analyzed older versions of

ShadowPad, the cyber attack platform we had found on four Piriform computers. Our
investigation revealed that ShadowPad had been previously used in South Korea, and in
Russia, where attackers intruded a computer, observing a money transfer.

CCleaner attack: How the threat actors got into the Piriform network
To initiate the CCleaner attack, the threat actors first accessed Piriform’s network on March
11, 2017, four months before Avast acquired the company, using TeamViewer on a
developer workstation to infiltrate. They successfully gained access with a single sign-in,
which means they knew the login credentials. While we don’t know how the attackers got
their hands on the credentials, we can only speculate that the threat actors used credentials
the Piriform workstation user utilized for another service, which may have been leaked, to
access the TeamViewer account.
According to the log files, TeamViewer was accessed at 5 AM local time, when the PC was
unattended, but running. The attackers tried to install two malicious dlls, however, the
attempts were unsuccessful due to lack of admin rights to the system. On the third try, the
attackers succeeded to drop the payload, using VBScript, the scripting language developed
by Microsoft.

How attackers tried to get into the 1st computer
The next day, March 12, 2017, the attackers moved laterally onto a second computer, again
targeting an unattended computer outside of work hours (4 AM local time). The attackers
opened a backdoor through Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Service, delivering a binary and
payload to the computer’s registry. The payload delivered was an older version of the second
stage malware, which was delivered to 40 CCleaner users.

Two days later, the attackers went back to the first computer, also infecting it with the older
version of the second stage malware.

After several weeks of apparent inactivity, the next stage of the payload was delivered to the
first infected computer. We believe that the threat actors prepared the malicious binaries
during the period of inactivity. The attackers applied several techniques to infiltrate other
computers in the internal network, including using passwords gathered by the keylogger, and
logging in with administrative privileges through the Windows Remote Desktop application.
The payload delivered was the infamous ShadowPad, which we believe was intended as the
third stage of the CCleaner attack. It was delivered as a mscoree.dll library to four computers
in the Piriform network, including a build server, masking as a .NET runtime library to go
unnoticed. This library, which was stored on the disk, had a time stamp on it, revealing that
the version of ShadowPad we found was compiled on April 4, 2017. This was just eight days
before it was installed on the Piriform computers, meaning it was customized for the attack,
which we also described in earlier blog posts in March and September.
The attackers were in the Piriform network five months before they snuck the malicious
payload into the CCleaner build. Avast acquired Piriform on July 18, 2017 and the first
CCleaner build with the malicious payload appeared on August 2, 2017. It’s interesting it took
them so long before they initiated their attack on CCleaner users.

ShadowPad active in South Korea and Russia
After analyzing the ShadowPad executable from the Piriform network, we looked for similar
files on VirusTotal. We found two samples, one that appeared in South Korea and the other
in Russia.
The sample that was uploaded to VirusTotal from South Korea was uploaded on December
27, 2017. It was created to communicate with CnC servers hosted by Konkuk University in
South Korea, probably on a hacked PC. Based on how the sample was uploaded and the
information included, we think a user uploaded it to VirusTotal, rather than a security
company.

The second ShadowPad executable we found on VirusTotal targeted a computer in Russia
that was operated by an organization involved with the distribution of public budgets. One
submission was uploaded with a file name and the second submission was uploaded to

VirusTotal from China. The first file was submitted on November 3, 2017, and the second
three days later on November 6, 2017.
In the second submission, we found a 7ZIP file that contained further files, including the
previous submission, along with an encrypted log from the keylogger module. We decrypted
the log file and found keypresses in various processes, such as from Microsoft Word, Firefox,
Windows Explorer, and КриптоПро CSP (CryptoPro CSP). The most interesting were logs
from Firefox, where the user completed financial transactions. We also found a contract,
which is also public record, and names of employees involved in these processes.
An interesting takeaway from the analysis of the ShadowPad version from Russia was that
ShadowPad hasn’t always been modular. In the version from Russia, all modules were
bundled in one executable, rather than separately stored in the Windows registry, as was the
case with the version used for the Piriform attack. The bundled version gave us insights into
a more thorough range of modules the attackers programmed. The attackers didn’t even
bother to download some of them to the Piriform network; only three of the plugins that were
used in the attack in Russia were also used for the Piriform attack.

ShadowPad modules used in the Russian attack
The oldest malicious executable used in the Russian attack was built in 2014, which means
the group behind it might have been spying for years. The specific payment information we
found traced by the key logger is public record, however it is likely that the attackers also
accessed sensitive information.

Cybersecurity needs to become a core part of M&A due diligence
The examples of ShadowPad in South Korea and Russia re-emphasize that ShadowPad has
been active for a long time, and it is frightening to see how ShadowPad can spy on
institutions and organizations so thoroughly.
In terms of CCleaner, up to 2.27 million CCleaner consumers and businesses downloaded
the infected CCleaner product. The attackers then installed the malicious second stage on
just 40 PCs operated by high-tech and telecommunications companies. We don’t have proof
that a possible third stage with ShadowPad was distributed via CCleaner to any of the 40
PCs.
For Avast, there are two key takeaways from the CCleaner attack. First, M&A due diligence
has to go beyond just legal and financial matters. Companies need to strongly focus on
cybersecurity, and for us this has now become one of the key areas that require attention
during an acquisition process. Second, the supply chain hasn’t been a key priority for
businesses, but this needs to change. Attackers will always try to find the weakest link, and if
a product is downloaded by millions of users it is an attractive target for them. Companies
need to increase their attention and investment in keeping the supply chain secure.
