Summary

1/16

Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers investigated reports that the LV
ransomware had the same code structure as REvil. This overlap could indicate that the
GOLD SOUTHFIELD cybercriminal threat group that operates REvil sold the source code,
that the source code was stolen, or that GOLD SOUTHFIELD shared the code with another
threat group as part of a partnership. CTU™ analysis confirmed that the GOLD
NORTHFIELD threat group, which operates LV, replaced the configuration of a REvil v2.03
beta version to repurpose the REvil binary for the LV ransomware.
CTU researchers have not observed LV ransomware advertisements on underground forums
as of this publication. However, variations in partner and campaign IDs across LV
configurations and the practice of naming and shaming victims could indicate that GOLD
NORTHFIELD is launching a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offering.

LV packer
The packed LV ransomware samples identified by CTU researchers appear to use the same
basic crypter. Figure 1 shows the entire contents of the packed executable's main function,
which contains five of the executable's nine functions.

The packed executable stores the LV ransomware binary as RC4-encrypted data within a
section named 'enc' (see Figure 2).

executable. (Source: Secureworks)
The packed samples analyzed by CTU researchers use the hard-coded
"kZlXjn3o373483wb6ne1LIBNWD3KWBEK" key to decrypt the contents of the enc section.
The "This program cannot be run in DOS mode" string is removed from decrypted binaries'
PE headers (see Figure 3).

Once decrypted, the ransomware binary is copied into a new memory allocation created with
Read/Write/Execute (RWE) access rights. The packer then executes the unpacked
ransomware binary by jumping to the entry point defined in the PE header.

Origin and configuration
The code structure and functionality of the LV ransomware sample analyzed by CTU
researchers are identical to REvil. The version value in the LV binary is 2.02, its compile
timestamp is 2020-06-15 16:24:05, and its configuration is stored in a section named
'.7tdlvx'. These characteristics align with REvil 2.02 samples first identified in the wild on
June 17, 2020. The LV sample also contains a code segment that is unique to REvil 2.03.
The only purpose of this code segment in REvil binary is to taunt prominent security
researchers. LV replaces the insults with the space character (see Figure 4).

This type of code modification suggests that GOLD NORTHFIELD does not have access to
REvil's source code. The threat actors likely used a hex editor to remove potentially
identifying characteristics from the binary to conceal that LV is a repurposed version of REvil.
The hard-coded 2.02 version value and the unique REvil 2.03 code suggests that GOLD
NORTHFIELD used a beta version of REvil 2.03 as the basis for LV ransomware.

REvil binary repurposing
The GOLD NORTHFIELD threat actors replaced the REvil configuration stored within the
binary's '.7tdlvx' section with their own configuration. Successful replacement required the
format of the REvil and LV configurations to be identical. Figure 5 shows the LV configuration
extracted from the REvil binary. It is a JSON-formatted string containing key elements utilized
by REvil (e.g., sub, net, dmn, pk).

GOLD NORTHFIELD then had to RC4-encrypt the LV configuration with a 32-byte key. To
bypass REvil's anti-tamper control that ensures the integrity of the configuration (see Figure
6), GOLD NORTHFIELD also had to generate a CRC32 hash of the updated encrypted
configuration and then replace the hard-coded precalculated CRC32 hash stored in the
binary with the updated configuration's CRC32 hash. These changes are necessary because
the REvil code calculates the configuration's CRC32 hash value at runtime and terminates if
the calculated and hard-coded hashes do not match.

Finally, GOLD NORTHFIELD could add the RC4 key used to encrypt the configuration, the
CRC32 hash of the encrypted configuration, the length of the encrypted configuration, and
the encrypted configuration itself to the REvil binary via the identified configuration section
(.7tdlvx) in the defined order (see Figure 7).

If done correctly, the binary will successfully execute using LV's updated configuration. Files
on the victim's system will be encrypted with session keys that are protected by LV's public
key, and victims will be directed to LV's ransom payment site via the updated ransom note.
7/16

Configuration comparisons
CTU analysis of numerous LV configurations led to several insights:
The dmn configuration element was consistently assigned an empty string (e.g., "dmn":
""). In a standard REvil configuration, this value contains over 1,200 command and
control (C2) domains that the malware uses to communicate infection information to
the threat actor. This information can include the ransomware version, session keys
used for file encryption, public key used to encrypt the session keys, and victims'
details such as username, hostname, and region. Although the net configuration key is
set to False in the LV samples, removal of all domains from the dmn configuration key
ensures that LV ransomware victims' data is not sent to REvil C2 servers. Removing
these domains rather than replacing them with C2 domains operated by GOLD
NORTHFIELD suggests that the group may not be capable of maintaining C2
infrastructure or developing the backend automation required to process and track
victims' data.
The partner ID (pid) varied in some of the configurations. This variation suggests that
GOLD NORTHFIELD could leverage this element to track individual RaaS partners,
which is how GOLD SOUTHFIELD uses this element. However, LV configurations had
matching bcrypted partner IDs across different configurations. Although the pid is
hashed, a partner could be tracked using the bcrypted hash value. REvil generates a
new bcrypted hash for each configuration, making partner tracking impossible.
The campaign ID (sub) varied in some of the configurations. GOLD NORTHFIELD
might have adopted GOLD SOUTHFIELD's approach of using this element to track
individual campaigns or configuration builds.
The attacker's public key (pk) was different in each configuration. GOLD NORTHFIELD
needs a master encryption key pair to decrypt files encrypted by LV ransomware. The
pk rotation across configurations suggests the creation of a unique key pair for each
victim, which prevents file decryption across multiple victims if the attacker's private key
is obtained.

8/16

The only ransom note (nbody) change from the standard REvil format was replacing
REvil's ransom payment Tor domain with LV's domain (see Figure 8).

Ransom payment site
After accessing the ransom payment site, victims are presented with a basic form that
requests the key from the ransom note (see Figure 9).

9/16

Previous CTU analysis of the REvil ransom note determined that this key represents
information about the ransomware infection that has been encrypted and then Base64encoded:
Compromised host details:
CPU architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
Fixed-drive information (drive letter, drive type, total size, and free space)
Workgroup/domain
Configured locale, and whether it aligns with one of the specified countries where
the malware cannot be used
Hostname
Operating system
Ransomware details:
Configured partner ID
Threat actor's configured public key
Encrypted session private key
Configured campaign ID
Unique ID based on host's volume serial number and CPUID
Victim's username
Ransomware version

As of this publication, CTU researchers have identified three ransom payment Tor domains
specified in LV ransom notes. Each of the domains successfully loads the landing page, but
CTU researchers' attempts to submit the key from the ransom note returned HTTP errors
(see Table 1).

Table 1. LV ransom payment domains and HTTP errors.
The HTTP errors may be caused by anti-analysis controls implemented by GOLD
NORTHFIELD to inspect characteristics of the submitted key for suspicious or undesirable
activity. They may also indicate that the threat group is struggling to maintain resilient
infrastructure due to lack of skill or insufficient resources.
When key submission is successful, the site displays a page showing the ransom amount in
U.S. dollars and how much time the victim has to pay the ransom before sensitive data is
disclosed (see Figure 10). The page also includes a live chat function for the victim to
interact with the threat actors.

Leak sites
CTU researchers identified two LV ransomware leak sites that have an identical structure but
appear to be operated independently. The sites listed victims during the same timeframe, but
only one victim was listed on both sites (see Figure 11). It is unclear why GOLD
NORTHFIELD would operate two leak sites.

12/16

Figure 11. Victims added to LV leak sites between March 7 and April 14, 2021. Only one
victim (highlighted in yellow) was listed on both sites. (Source: Secureworks)
The leak sites name and shame victims. The threat actors coerce the victims into paying the
ransom by threatening to publish their sensitive information (see Figure 12).

Figure 12. LV leak site. (Source: Secureworks)
GOLD NORTHFIELD typically threatens to publicly release sensitive information if victims do
not initiate contact within 72 hours. The threat actors post screenshots of the victim's
sensitive files on the leak sites to support their claims. However, it appears that none of the
victims' data has been released as of this publication. It is unclear if victims paid the ransom
and the threat actors just keep the full list of victims on the leak site as evidence of their
conquests.

Conclusion
13/16

CTU analysis revealed that the LV ransomware is not a distinct ransomware family; it is
repurposed REvil ransomware. By modifying the binary of a prolific ransomware family, the
GOLD NORTHFIELD threat actors significantly expedited their maturity within the
ransomware ecosystem. Without expending resources on ransomware development, the
group can operate more efficiently than its competitors while still offering a best-in-class
ransomware offering, ultimately resulting in a more profitable business model. GOLD
NORTHFIELD's unauthorized manipulation of REvil will likely prompt GOLD SOUTHFIELD
to implement additional anti-tamper controls and modify configuration storage and
processing to impede future attempts to overwrite the REvil configuration.
It is too early in GOLD NORTHFIELD's evolution to evaluate the threat it poses. The ability to
repurpose the REvil binary suggests that the threat actors have technical capabilities.
Additionally, the complexity required for this repurposing and the configuration variations
across LV samples suggest that GOLD NORTHFIELD may have automated the process.
Although a RaaS for the LV ransomware could provide direct competition for GOLD
SOUTHFIELD's RaaS offering, the lack of a reliable and organized infrastructure needed to
operate a successful RaaS offering suggests that GOLD NORTHFIELD has to expand its
capabilities and resources to compete with other ransomware operations.
