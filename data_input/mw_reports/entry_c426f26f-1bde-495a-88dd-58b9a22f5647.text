China-Linked Group RedEcho
Targets the Indian Power
Sector Amid Heightened
Border Tensions

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

This report details a campaign conducted by a China-linked threat
activity group, RedEcho, targeting the Indian power sector. The activity
was identified through a combination of large-scale automated network
traffic analytics and expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded
Future Platform, SecurityTrails, Spur, Farsight, and common open-source
tools and techniques. The report will be of most interest to individuals
engaged in strategic and operational intelligence relating to Indian and
Chinese activity in cyberspace.
Recorded Future notified the appropriate Indian government
departments prior to publication of the suspected intrusions to support
incident response and remediation investigations within the impacted
organizations.

Executive Summary
Relations between India and China have deteriorated
significantly following border clashes in May 2020 that
resulted in the first combat deaths in 45 years between
the world’s two most populous nations. As a result, on
January 12, 2021, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam
Jaishankar announced that trust between India and
China was “profoundly disturbed.” While diplomacy and
economic factors have been effective in preventing a
full-blown war, notable most recently with the bilateral
disengagement at the border, cyber operations continue
to provide countries with a potent asymmetric capability
to conduct espionage or pre-position within networks
for potentially disruptive reasons.
Since early 2020, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group
observed a large increase in suspected targeted intrusion
activity against Indian organizations from Chinese statesponsored groups. From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded
Future’s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the
use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE,
which encompasses ShadowPad command and control
(C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power
sector. 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations,
including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch Centres
(RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid
through balancing electricity supply and demand, have
been identified as targets in a concerted campaign
against India’s critical infrastructure. Other targets
identified included 2 Indian seaports.

CTA-CN-2021-0228

Using a combination of proactive adversary
infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and Recorded
Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined
that a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers
share some common infrastructure tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) with several previously reported
Chinese state-sponsored groups, including APT41 and
Tonto Team.
Despite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt
Group does not currently believe there is enough
evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular
campaign to an existing public group and therefore
continue to track it as a closely related but distinct
activity group, RedEcho.

Key Judgments
• The targeting of Indian critical infrastructure
offers limited economic espionage opportunities;
however, we assess they pose significant
concerns over potential pre-positioning of
network access to support Chinese strategic
objectives.
• Pre-positioning on energy assets may support
several potential outcomes, including geostrategic signaling during heightened bilateral
tensions, supporting influence operations, or as a
precursor to kinetic escalation.
• RedEcho has strong infrastructure and
victimology overlaps with Chinese groups APT41/
Barium and Tonto Team, while ShadowPad is
used by at least 5 distinct Chinese groups.
• The high concentration of IPs resolving to Indian
critical infrastructure entities communicating
over several months with a distinct subset
of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers used by
RedEcho indicate a targeted campaign, with little
evidence of wider targeting in Recorded Future’s
network telemetry.

ShadowPad — From Exclusivity to Widespread Use
ShadowPad is a modular backdoor first identified in the
Netsarang compromise in 2017, an intrusion later attributed
to APT41 (BARIUM) by FireEye. While ShadowPad was initially
considered exclusive to APT41, additional China-nexus groups
began using ShadowPad in network intrusion campaigns
from late 2019. We assess that the sharing of ShadowPad is
prevalent across groups affiliated with both Chinese Ministry
of State Security (MSS) and groups affiliated with the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA), and is likely linked to the presence of a
centralized ShadowPad developer or quartermaster responsible
for maintaining and updating the tool.
Presently, we are aware of at least 5 Chinese threat activity
groups using ShadowPad, including APT41, Tonto Team, groups
using the Icefog malware, KeyBoy, and Tick. Most recently,
ShadowPad infrastructure was also connected to a compromise
impacting the Mongolian business management suite Able
Software. This intrusion featured tooling overlaps with Chinesenexus groups TA428 and LuckyMouse, suggesting that the
sharing of ShadowPad across Chinese threat activity groups
continues to increase.

www.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future ®

In September 2020, 5 Chinese APT41 operators were
indicted by the United States (US) government and linked to
the front company Chengdu 404 Network Technology. One of
the accused previously claimed to be “very close” to the MSS,
continuing an established trend of Chinese private contractors
and front companies conducting cyber espionage activity on
behalf of the MSS. Conversely, Tonto Team has been linked to
the PLA, specifically the Shenyang Military Region Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau. ShadowPad is the latest in a long line of
examples of custom capabilities being shared across disparate
Chinese threat activity groups for use in cyber espionage
activity.

Threat Analysis
The network infrastructure used in ShadowPad infections
is tracked by Insikt Group as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE. This
technique fingerprints unique characteristics including header
responses and similar network components. Using a combination
of proactive infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and
network traffic analysis, we have determined that a subset
of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers are being used by a
China-linked activity group we track as RedEcho, to target a
large swath of India’s power sector.

RedEcho Infrastructure TTPs
A subset of the RedEcho AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers
listed in table 1 below were configured with domains spoofing
various Indian power generation and electricity transmission
entities. For example, the ntpc-co[.]com domain is likely
a typosquat of ntpc[.]co[.]in, the website of Indian power
generation company NTPC Limited. The domain was first
registered in July 2019, as noted in the Recorded Future new
domain registration feed:

Typosquat and brand abuse detection are two of the many
features of Recorded Future’s Brand Intelligence module, enabling
organizations to proactively hunt for suspicious infrastructure as
it is being established by adversaries.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Insikt Group profiled the identified RedEcho operational
infrastructure and identified a pattern of behavior, in line with
the concept of viewing network indicators as composite objects.
RedEcho’s operational infrastructure modus operandi in the
identified intrusion campaign can be summarized as follows:
• Domains were registered through the registrar WEBCC
and used an uncommon authoritative name server,
eznowdns[.]com
• RedEcho operational infrastructure associated with the
Chinese domain and infrastructure reseller cndns[.]com
• Used the WhoisProtection WHOIS privacy protection
service
• AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure hosted on HKBN
Enterprise Solutions HK Limited (AS9381) and EHOSTICT
(AS45382)
• Domains spoofed (lexically similar) Indian entities or
featured strings referencing India
• Used a common top level domain (.com)
• Used dynamic DNS domains for operational
infrastructure (further details below)

Domain

While none of these characteristics are individually unique to
RedEcho, viewing these holistically identified unique behaviors
in combination is likely indicative of RedEcho activity. Based
on these highlighted TTPs, we identified additional domains
that were likely related, which featured overlaps with known
AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers as well as historical hosting
data for domains within the highlighted infrastructure cluster.
Further pivots constrained to shared historic hosting
infrastructure identified a further cluster of RedEcho dynamic
DNS (DDNS) domains which share the same Indian-themed
domain naming pattern and links to AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE
servers:

RedEcho Victimology
Derived from Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis,
we were able to determine a clear and consistent pattern of
Indian organizations being targeted in this campaign through
the behavioral profiling of network traffic to adversary
infrastructure. Much of the observed network activity inbound
to the AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure was over SSL
via TCP port 443. We also noted substantial inbound traffic to
the AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure indicative of HTTP
proxying activity over TCP 8080 and DNS requests (UDP 53) for
the C2 domains hosted on AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers (see
below Infrastructure section).

Outlook
In this research, we outlined a series of suspected targeted
intrusions against India’s power sector that were observed
beginning in mid-2020. The intrusions were conducted by a
China-linked activity group we track as RedEcho. The group
made heavy use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE — a term we use
to track infrastructure that comprises ShadowPad C2s, which is
shared between several Chinese threat activity groups, including
APT41/Barium, Tonto team, the Icefog cluster, KeyBoy, and Tick.
The intrusions overlap with previous Indian energy sector
targeting by Chinese threat activity groups in 2020 that also
used AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure. Therefore, the
focus in targeting India’s electricity system possibly indicates a
sustained strategic intent to access India’s energy infrastructure.
Network access to Regional Load Despatch Centres provide
minimal benefit for economic espionage objectives, but are of
strategic interest to enable access pre-positioning for a variety
of potential outcomes such as:
• To send a robust signaling message as a “show of force”
• To enable influence operations to sway public opinion
during a diplomatic confrontation
• To support potential future disruptive cyber operations
against critical infrastructure
As bilateral tensions continue to rise, we expect to see
a continued increase in cyber operations being conducted
by China-linked groups such as RedEcho in line with national
strategic interests. While economic recovery from the impact of
the coronavirus pandemic will be a priority for both countries, the
increasing rhetoric and the kinetic escalation of border tensions
suggests there is clearly mistrust and uncertainty within each
government. Further, China will likely also continue to exert
influence over other nations, particularly those that are within
the sphere of influence of their BRI investment program, which
may lead to more cyber operations aimed at furthering strategic
advantage.

Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy

Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks
threat actors and their activity, focusing on state actors
from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cyber
criminals - individuals and groups - from Russia, CIS states,
China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity
groups and where possible, attributing them to nation state
government, organizations, or affiliate institutions.

ADVERSARY

Our coverage includes:
•

Government organizations and intelligence
agencies, their associated laboratories, partners,
industry collaborators, proxy entities, and
individual threat actors.

•

Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation
state activity groups, such as RedAlpha,
RedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many
other industry established groups.

•

Cybercriminal individuals and groups established
and named by Recorded Future

•

Newly emerging malware, as well as
prolific,persistent commodity malware

INFRASTRUCTURE

CAPABILITY

VICTIM

Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or
campaign when analysts have data corresponding to at
least three points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion
Analysis with at least medium confidence, derived from our
Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie this to a threat actor
only when we can point to a handle, persona, person, or
organization responsible. We will write about the activity as
a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data.
We use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation state threat actor groups
or campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag
colors, currently represented below, with more color/nation
pairings to be added as we identify and attribute new threat
actor groups associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming
newly identified malware.
