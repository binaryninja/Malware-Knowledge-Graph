security firm that uncovered its campaigns

Iranian cyberespionage group Charming Kitten, which has been operating since 2014, has
impersonated the cybersecurity firm that exposed its operations and campaigns. Israeli firm
ClearSky Security said the group managed to copy its official website hosted on a similarlooking domain - clearskysecurity[.]net.
ClearSky's actual website is Clearskysec.com.

Fake ClearSky website
"Charming Kitten built a phishing website impersonating our company," ClearSky said. "They
copied pages from our public website and changed one of them to include a 'sign in' option
with multiple services. These sign in options are all phishing pages that would send the
victim's credentials to the attackers."
ClearSky's official website does not feature any sign-in options. Researchers noted the fake
website is likely still under construction.

"It seems that the impersonating website is still being built because some of the pages have
error messages in them," ClearSky said.
ClearSky added that Charming Kitten was hosting the fake domain on an older server that
the researchers had ousted on June 12. They also found one page on the fake ClearSky
website that wasn't customized yet, but contained content from the attackers' earlier
campaign. This also further indicates Charming Kitten is likely behind the fake website.
Since the website was still incomplete, ClearSky does not believe the hackers managed to
phish anyone, adding that its employees, systems and clients were not affected by the
incident. The fake website was marked as a suspicious website via the Safe Browsing API
shortly after it was uncovered and has since been taken down.

Charming Kitten behavior
The advanced persistent threat (APT), also known as Newscaster or Newsbeef, has long
targeted academic researchers, human rights activists , political advisors, and media outlets
that are of interest to Iran.
The group usually attacks its targets leveraging made up organizations and people to lure
people into malicious websites, impersonating real companies, watering hole attacks and
spear-phishing.
As one of Iran's oldest APTs, Charming Kitten has typically attacked targets in Iran, the
United States, Israel and the UK among others. Some of the group's campaigns over the
past few years include Saffron Rose, Newscaster and the StoneDrill wiper.
Other legitimate companies impersonated by the hacking group include United Technologies
(UTC). In early 2017, the attackers created a fake UTC website that claimed to offer "Free
Special Programs and Courses for Employees of Aerospace companies" that designed to
dupe visitors into downloading a fake Flash Player that was actually the group's DownPaper
malware.
Iranian national Behzad Mesri, who was charged in the US with hacking HBO and stealing
multiple Game of Thrones files, is believed to be a part of the Charming Kitten entourage.
"While Iranian threat actors have been well documented by security researchers, the inner
workings of the ecosystem of Iran's hackers is not entirely clear," ClearSky researchers
wrote in an earlier report. "Groups can be vigorously active for years and then disappear
abruptly, sometimes due to being publicly outed. Researchers make a best-faith effort to
assign operations to certain groups, but the instability in the field makes the process
challenging."
