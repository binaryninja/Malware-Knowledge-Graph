Threat Spotlight: AsyncRAT campaigns feature new version
of 3LOSH crypter
blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/04/asyncrat-3losh-update.html

By Edmund Brumaghin, with contributions from Alex Karkins.
Ongoing malware distribution campaigns are using ISO disk images to deliver AsyncRAT,
LimeRAT and other commodity malware to victims.
The infections leverage process injection to evade detection by endpoint security software.
These campaigns appear to be linked to a new version of the 3LOSH crypter, previously
covered here.
Malware distributors often leverage tools to obfuscate their binary payloads and make detection
and analysis more difficult. These tools often combine functionality normally associated with
packers and crypters and, in many cases, are not directly tied to the malware payload itself. Over
the past several months we have observed a series of campaigns that leverage a new version of
one of these tools, referred to as 3LOSH crypter. The threat actor(s) behind these campaigns
have been using 3LOSH to generate the obfuscated code responsible for the initial infection
process. Based on analysis of the embedded configuration stored within the samples associated
with these campaigns, we have identified that the same operator is likely distributing a variety of
commodity RATs, such as AsyncRAT and LimeRAT. These RATs feature various functionality that
enables them to be used to gain access to systems and exfiltrate sensitive information from
victims.

Infection process
The infection process begins with an ISO that contains a malicious VBScript that, when executed,
1/13

initiates a multi-stage infection process. The file naming convention for the ISO and the VBS
match and typically follow a convention consistent with the following:
^[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{6}\.(VBS|ISO)$

Stage 1 Execution
The VBS contains junk data and uses string replacement to attempt to obfuscate the executed
code. An example of this is shown below.

Obfuscated VBS.
Once deobfuscated, the VBS execution is straightforward: It retrieves and executes the next
stage from an attacker-controlled server.

Deobfuscated VBS.

Stage 2 retrieval
As expected, the retrieved content is a PowerShell script passed to the Invoke-Expression (IEX)
cmdlet and executed to continue the infection process. It is mainly responsible for creating a
series of scripts that are executed and carry out various tasks needed for the malware to
function.
Across various samples analyzed, the directory locations and file names vary, but are functionally
equivalent.

First, the script checks for the existence of a directory at the following location:
C:\ProgramData\Facebook\System32\Microsoft\SystemData

If it doesn't already exist, the directory is created. This folder is used as the working directory for
the malware and stores all the components used throughout the rest of the infection process. The
script then creates several additional scripts, writing content into each of them using a format
similar to the following example.

Script creation code example.
The following files are created in this manner:
Office.bat
Office.vbs
Office.ps1
Microsofd.bat
Microsofd.vbs
Microsofd.ps1
All of these scripts are stored in the previously created directory.

Malicious script components.
Finally, the Stage 2 PowerShell executes "Office.vbs" to begin the next step of the infection
process.

Stage 3 operations

3/13

Stage 3 is responsible for the majority of malicious activities performed on infected systems. The
first script, "Office.vbs," is executed by the Stage 2 PowerShell and invokes WScript to execute a
batch file called "Office.bat" to continue the infection process.

WScript batch file execution.
This batch file, in turn, executes a PowerShell script called 'Office.ps1'.

PowerShell script execution.
The next PowerShell script attempts to achieve persistence by creating a new Scheduled Task
called "Office" that is executed immediately and then repeated every two minutes, as shown
below.

Scheduled task creation.
This scheduled task then executes "Microsofd.vbs" as part of the creation process. This next
VBS initiates a short sleep before continuing. It is only responsible for executing "Microsofd.bat"
to continue the infection process.

4/13

WScript execution.
This next batch file only contains a single line, which invokes PowerShell and executes
'Microsofd.ps1'
PowerShell
execution.
This PowerShell script is the final script executed in this chain. It was written by the Stage 2
PowerShell, along with the other scripts that we've described. This script contains two large GZIP
blobs and another function responsible for decompressing them.

Stage 3 decompression function.
One of the blobs is an injector and the other is the final payload that is injected and executed.
This is accomplished by invoking aspnet_compiler.exe, injecting the final payload, and executing
it.

Stage 3 injection process.
The diagram below shows the execution flow.

Infection flow diagram.

The final payload varied across samples analyzed, the majority of which were AsyncRAT and
LimeRAT. Based on the RAT configuration embedded in the samples, we believe with high
confidence that the same threat actor(s) are likely leveraging both RATs in these campaigns.

Links to 3LOSH crypter
During our analysis of the samples, infrastructure and final payloads associated with these
campaigns, we identified several characteristics that indicated a new version of the 3LOSH
builder/crypter used to obfuscate the RAT payloads and facilitate the infection process. 3LOSH
crypter is a malware crypter we previously analyzed here.
In analyzing the code execution of the Stage 2 PowerShell, we noticed some similarities with
later stages of the infection process described in our previous analysis of the 3LOSH builder. The
code present in our initial sample set featured a significant amount of similarities and overlap with
samples we identified associated with a new version of 3LOSH. This new version of the crypter
features the following notable changes from previous versions.
Binary payloads are now embedded using GZIP compression rather than simply Base64
encoded and scripts feature a decompression function that is the same across both sample
clusters.
The infection chain is more complicated, featuring the use of multiple script-based
components (BAT, VBS, PS1) that facilitate the infection process.
While there are also differences between the two clusters, this may be due to the threat actor
only utilizing the portion of the builder output required for their purposes, or this may be due to
options selected during the build process. Additionally, while analyzing our original sample cluster
and new samples created using the 3LOSH crypter, we identified several final payloads in both
clusters that use the same infrastructure for post-compromise C2 communications.
7/13

Matching RAT configs in both sample clusters.
While analyzing one of the AsyncRAT payloads in our original sample cluster, we also observed
that the Group_ID in the embedded RAT configuration was set to "3LOSH."

3LOSH group identifier

3LOSH continues to be under active development and in use by threat actors distributing a
variety of commodity RATs. We expect that this activity will continue and organizations should
ensure they maintain the ability to detect malicious activity associated with 3LOSH, independent
of the final payload itself.

Conclusion
8/13

These malware distribution campaigns have been ongoing for the past several months, with new
samples being uploaded to public repositories on a daily basis. The 3LOSH crypter continues to
be actively maintained and improved by its author and will likely continue to be used by various
threat actors attempting to evade detection in corporate environments. Organizations should be
aware that even commodity malware can take advantage of the complexity and evasiveness
offered by crypters to increase their operational effectiveness as adversaries attempt to leverage
them to achieve their mission objectives. A layered defense-in-depth security architecture should
be implemented to ensure that organizations maintain the ability to successfully defend against
these threats.
