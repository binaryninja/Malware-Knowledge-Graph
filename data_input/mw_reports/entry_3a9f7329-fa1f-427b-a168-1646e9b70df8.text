Amid Rising Magecart
Attacks on Online Ordering
Platforms, Recent Campaigns
Infect 311 Restaurants

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Threat actors infect e-commerce websites with Magecart e-skimmers to steal
online shoppers’ payment card data, billing information, and personally identifiable
information (PII). To counter this threat, Recorded Future’s Magecart Overwatch
program monitors hundreds of thousands of e-commerce websites to identify the
presence of e-skimmer infections. This report details 2 recent Magecart campaigns
that targeted 3 restaurant online ordering platforms, leading to the exposure of online
transactions at 311 restaurants. The intended audience is financial institutions’ fraud
and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) teams and e-commerce security professionals.

Key Findings

Executive Summary
Online ordering platforms for restaurants enable customers
to make online food orders and allow restaurants to outsource
the burden of developing an ordering system. While top-end
online ordering platforms like Uber Eats and DoorDash dominate
the market, there are also hundreds of smaller online ordering
platforms that serve small, local restaurants — and even smallscale platforms may have hundreds of restaurants as clients. As
a result, online ordering platforms have become a high-value
target for threat actors conducting Magecart e-skimmer attacks
because compromising a single online ordering platform typically
results in the exposure of online transactions performed at a
significant portion of the restaurants that use the platform.
Recently, we identified 2 separate ongoing Magecart
campaigns that have injected e-skimmer scripts into the online
ordering portals of restaurants using 3 separate platforms:
MenuDrive, Harbortouch, and InTouchPOS. Across all 3 platforms,
at least 311 restaurants have been infected with Magecart
e-skimmers, a number that is likely to grow with additional
analysis.
The Magecart e-skimmer infections on these restaurants’
websites often result in the exposure of customers’ payment card
data and PII (their billing information and contact information).
To date, we have already identified over 50,000 compromised
payment card records that were exposed from these infected
restaurants and posted for sale on the dark web.

• The online ordering platforms MenuDrive and
Harbortouch were targeted by the same Magecart
campaign, resulting in e-skimmer infections on 80
restaurants using MenuDrive and 74 using Harbortouch.
This campaign likely began no later than January 18,
2022, and as of this report, a portion of the restaurants
remained infected; however, the malicious domain used
for the campaign (authorizen[.]net) has been blocked
since May 26, 2022.
• The online platform InTouchPOS was targeted by a
separate, unrelated Magecart campaign, resulting in
e-skimmer infections on 157 restaurants using the
platform. This campaign began no later than November
12, 2021, and as of this report, a portion of the
restaurants remain infected and the malicious domains
(bouncepilot[.]net and pinimg[.]org) remain active.
• We have identified more than 50,000 payment card
records that were skimmed from these 311 restaurants
and posted for sale on the dark web. Additional
compromised records from these restaurants have likely
been, and will continue to be, posted for sale on the dark
web.
• The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and
indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the
campaign targeting InTouchPOS match those of another
campaign targeting e-commerce websites that do not
use a centralized online ordering platform. This related
campaign has infected over 400 e-commerce websites
since May 2020, with over 30 of the websites still
infected as of June 21, 2022.

Background

Threat Analysis

Cybercriminals often seek the highest payout for the least
amount of work. This has led them to target restaurants’ online
ordering platforms; when even a single platform is attacked,
dozens or even hundreds of restaurants can have their
transactions compromised, which allows cybercriminals to steal
vast amounts of customer payment card data disproportionate
to the number of systems they actually hack. The COVID-19
pandemic has only exacerbated this due to an influx of online
ordering as restaurants’ dine-in options were restricted.

Recorded Future discovered the MenuDrive and Harbortouch
Magecart campaign’s e-skimmers on 154 restaurants’ ordering
webpages: 80 restaurants hosted on MenuDrive’s domains
order.menudrive[.]com and orderstart[.]com, and 74 restaurants
hosted on Harbortouch’s domain holo.harbortouch[.]com. These
154 infected restaurants represent 32% of the 488 restaurants
that Recorded Future determined use either online ordering
platform.

In May 2021, we reported on breaches at 5 restaurant
online ordering platforms, including Grabull, EasyOrdering, and
eDiningExpress. The latter 2 platforms (as well as MenuDrive,
Harbortouch, and InTouchPOS) all operate in a similar way:
they offer a restaurant-specific ordering application hosted on
platform-operated domains. As a result, if threat actors gain
unauthorized access to a given online ordering platform’s shared
libraries, they can modify server-side scripts to affect numerous
merchants through a single compromise, as these merchants
often rely on the same shared libraries.
This most recent attack was not Harbortouch’s first breach.
In 2015, Harbortouch admitted to a data breach exposing an
unspecified number of restaurants; cybersecurity blog Krebs on
Security reported that at least 4,200 stores running Harbortouch
software were compromised.

Based on transaction analysis of when compromised
payment cards transacted at the infected restaurants, the
campaign began no later than January 18, 2022. The malicious
e-skimmer loader scripts are still present on a portion of the
websites; however, authorizen[.]net, the malicious domain used
to host the e-skimmers themselves and receive stolen data, has
been blocked since May 26, 2022. While this means that it is
highly likely that online transactions conducted after May 26,
2022 were not compromised, restaurants using MenuDrive and
Harbortouch remain at high risk until the underlying vulnerabilities
are remediated.
The InTouchPOS Magecart campaign’s e-skimmers appeared
on 157 restaurants’ ordering webpages. Based on file modification
data contained in the e-skimmer scripts, this campaign began
no later than November 12, 2021, and a significant portion of the
restaurants remain infected as of this writing. Magecart analysis
of the restaurants’ portals revealed that 135 of the restaurants
were victimized through the malicious domain bouncepilot[.]net
and 22 through the malicious domain pinimg[.]org. As detailed
below in the “Campaign Analysis” section for InTouchPOS, both
of these malicious domains have been attributed to a single
Magecart campaign.

elements, which it stores in “nmem” (referenced above).

The e-skimmer used on Harbortouch victims is similar to

button).

InTouchPOS E-Skimmer
In the Magecart attack, the threat actors injected a firststage downloader into an in-use JavaScript file hosted on the
victim restaurant’s platform-specific main page. The loader is
designed to immediately retrieve and execute the e-skimmer
script.
