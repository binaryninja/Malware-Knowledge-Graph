This Chat is Being Recorded: Egregor Ransomware Negotiations Uncovered

Incident Response July 21, 2021

Ransomware attacks are topping the charts as the most common attack type to target
organizations with a constant drumbeat of attacks impacting industries across the board. In
fact, IBM Security X-Force has seen a more than 10% increase in ransomware incident
response requests compared to this time last year.
Ransomware is well on its way toward becoming a global billion-dollar enterprise – one that
victims are funding. Attackers are operating like a well-oiled business industry, yielding high
profits in a year that most businesses struggled. Why? The new ransomware business model
is relentless, extortive and paying off.
IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence analysts, together with Cylera, an IoT and medical
device security intelligence company that works with IBM Security to deliver IoMT solutions,
have obtained and analyzed hours of chat correspondence and negotiations that occurred in
December 2020 between the notorious Egregor ransomware actors, responsible for upwards
of $80 million dollars in losses globally. The chat correspondence had negotiations with
approximately 40 victim organizations they chatted with. The activity uncovered in these chat
transcripts provides valuable insight into how some ransomware actors operate – from how
they conduct ransom payment negotiations, to the strategies and operational structure they
used.
Although law enforcement took action against Egregor operations in February 2021, this
discovery provides the following insightful takeaways:
Defining the Ransom Demand – Initial ransom amounts ranged from $100,000 to $35
million. The average initial ransom demanded was $5 million. During one negotiation,
the threat actors indicated that their initial ransom demand is 5-10% of the potential
estimated loss associated with a data leak.
Ransom Negotiations – Several factors played a role in determining the final
negotiated ransom amount or data leak outcome, including the operators’ perception of
the victim’s ability and willingness to pay as well as the victim’s negotiation strategies
such as attempting to buy time and delay the payment.
Operational Structure – The chats reveal a highly sophisticated organized crime
group was behind Egregor operations. Numerous roles or teams were mentioned
including the financial department, data manager, attackers/IT specialists, PR manager,
publications manager and decryption tool master-maker.
Compassion with a Catch – X-Force researchers maintain the operators of
ransomware like Egregor are nefarious actors. However, the chat logs revealed a few
glimpses of what could be perceived as empathy or practical consideration. During one
negotiation, Egregor offered to provide the decryption key, in exchange for the
organization publicly announcing that the group does not intentionally target hospitals
or charities. In a chat with another victim, the threat actors discuss the hardships of
COVID-19, even wishing the victim happy holidays.

What is ‘Egregor’?
The Egregor ransomware was first reported publicly in mid-2020, making it a relatively new
entry into the criminal economy. Egregor operators work through an affiliate model, meaning
a small group of actors run and maintain the Egregor code base and other actors purchase
access to Egregor and use the malware on systems they infect. This model is best known as
Ransomware as A Service (RaaS).
Many security analysts speculated that Egregor was the follow-up to the Maze ransomware,
pointing to significant technical overlap between the two ransomware families after Maze’s
threat actors declared retirement in November 2020. Egregor gained significant recognition
in 2021 as affiliates shifted from Maze to using this new ransomware family and leaked
stolen information from impacted organizations, extorting them in efforts to collect a ransom.
The impact of Egregor ransomware has been felt worldwide with an estimated $80 million
dollars in profit through their operations against at least 150 organizations. Regarding
victims, the highest number of reported cases was in the United States with infections
clustered primarily within the manufacturing and retail industries. Some of the larger targets
have included Barnes and Noble, Randstad, French logistics firm Gefco and video game
companies Ubisoft and Crytek.
In February 2021, a joint French and Ukrainian law enforcement operation disrupted
Egregor’s infrastructure and arrested multiple Egregor associates. As of the time of this
publication, X-Force researchers are not aware of active Egregor intrusions.

What’s in a Ransom?
After reviewing elaborate chat logs between Egregor actors and representatives from
victimized organizations, we obtained interesting insights about how the ransom amount was
fixed and the overall negotiation process. In a common flow of events, upon initial contact
with victims, X-Force and Cylera analysts observed Egregor ransomware actors making an
initial demand for a ransom payment that depended on the victim and their perceived ability
to pay.
Analysis of approximately 50 ransom negotiations in Egregor chat logs from December 2020
shows that ransom demands varied wildly.
Average initial ransom demand

$5,024,000

Average ransom payment

$387,700

Highest initial ransom demand

$35,000,000

How each ransom amount was determined was likely a judgment call based on a
combination of publicly available information about the victim along with what the operators
perceived the victim could afford to pay.
Ultimately, researchers observed that the threat actors appeared to strike a balance between
a victim’s ability and willingness to pay while considering multiple additional factors. In one
negotiation, Egregor actors gave the victim organization an initial ransom demand of $1.7
million. Through some negotiating by the victim, explaining they were a small company,
Egregor operators decreased the ransom to $1 million.
In another example, Egregor operators alluded to using an analyst associated with Egregor
operations to estimate a victim’s total loss if they were to forego paying the ransom and
instead suffer a data leak. The attacker’s comments indicate that the initial ransom demand
is 5-10% of that estimated loss.

In another example, a victim pleads with the attackers for a lower ransom price due to the
inability to pay as a result of COVID-19 pandemic-related hardships. The Egregor actors
demanded proof from the victim that they were experiencing financial hardships, even going
as far as requesting information from the IRS.

Buying Time: A Victim’s Strategy
Deciding whether to pay and negotiating with the attackers is a hotly contested endeavor in
the security community. Both paying a ransom or deciding not to pay carry consequences.
We encourage organizations to review X-Force’s Definitive Guide to Ransomware, which
lists the main topics companies should consider when the question arises as to whether they
should pay a ransom.
Our review of the Egregor chat logs provides some insight into what mitigation or ransom
reduction techniques could be effective if one is ever faced with a ransomware incident:
Using company size to discount the ransom: In some cases, victims explained the
size of their business with Egregor actors, which resulted in lower ransom demands.
Getting money and cryptocurrency takes time: In other instances, analysts
observed victims explaining the process for acquiring money to pay the ransom, which
extended the time before the actors leaked information about the compromised
organization.

Well-Organized Cybercrime
While parsing through multiple conversations, X-Force and Cylera analysts noticed a variety
of roles the threat actors alluded to during the negotiation process.

6/11

Egregor negotiators referred to themselves as “members of the support team” who only get a
fixed salary and fear being fired. During discussions, they referred to other teams, including
the financial department, data manager, attackers/IT specialists, PR manager, publications
manager, and decryption tool master-maker.

Operators with a Heart?
Despite the intention of stealing millions of dollars from victims, the attackers have backed off
from their demands in some circumstances if they believed they could receive positive press
for doing so.

7/11

In one instance, X-Force and Cylera analysts observed negotiations between Egregor and a
charity. After a long conversation between the victim organization and Egregor operators,
Egregor offered to provide the decryption key, asking that the organization publicly announce
that the group does not intentionally target hospitals or charities.

In another ransom negotiation, the victim, a small U.S. dental practice, and Egregor support
are discussing the hardships of 2020, specifically COVID-19.

Key Takeaways
Despite the holiday wishes and reduced ransom in some instances, the December 2020 chat
logs obtained by X-Force and Cylera demonstrate that many Egregor attacks were a
successful, ruthless criminal operation. Although the threat actors have ceased from using
the Egregor ransomware family specifically, and only since the law enforcement activity in
February 2021, X-Force analysts believe that a new infrastructure can be mounted and the
same code can be used again in its original form or as modified code. Moreover, with these
attacks yielding extremely high profits for those residing in less prosperous parts of the
world, new ransomware families and gangs will continue to emerge and may take Egregor’s
place in the near future.
Ransomware attacks continue to be the top threat to organizations globally as this threat
grows and expands its reach year over year. Yet, even in the face of sophisticated threats,
there are actions companies can take that can help mitigate risks and minimize damage:

8/11

Establish and drill an incident response team. Whether in-house or as a retained
service, the formation of an incident response team and drilling the most relevant
attack scenarios to your organization can make a big difference in attack outcomes and
costs.
Establish and maintain offline backups. Ensure you have files safely stored from
attacker accessibility with read-only access. Also consider the use of offsite/cold
storage solutions. The availability of backup files is a significant differentiator for
organizations that can help recover from a ransomware attack.
Implement a strategy to prevent unauthorized data theft, especially as it applies to
uploading large amounts of data to legitimate cloud storage platforms that attackers
can abuse. Consider blocking outbound traffic to unapproved cloud hosting services.
Employ user and entity behavior analytics to identify potential security incidents.
When triggered, assume a breach has taken place. Audit, monitor and quickly act on
suspected abuse related to privileged accounts and groups.
Deploy multifactor authentication on all remote access points into an enterprise
network — with particular care given to secure or disable remote desktop protocol
(RDP) access. Multiple ransomware attacks have been known to exploit weak RDP
access to gain initial entry into a targeted network.
Use penetration testing to identify weak points in enterprise networks and
vulnerabilities that should be prioritized for patching. In particular, we recommend
implementing mitigations for CVE-2019-19781, which multiple threat actors have used
to gain initial entry into enterprises in 2020 and 2021 — including for ransomware
attacks.
Consider prioritizing the immediate remediation, as applicable, of the following
frequently exploited software vulnerabilities:
CVE-2019-2725
CVE-2020-2021
CVE-2020-5902
CVE-2018-8453
VPN-related CVEs
CVE-2019-11510
CVE-2019-11539
CVE-2018-13379
CVE-2019-18935
CVE-2021-22893
RDP

9/11

Restrict port access on TCP port 3389
Apply multifactor authentication to remote access logins
Remediate RDP vulnerabilities such as Windows RDP CVE-2019-0708
(BlueKeep)
CVE-2020-3427
CVE-2020-0610
CVE-2020-0609
Segment networks according to the data they host.
Encrypt the data most likely to be stolen in an attack.
Consider adopting a Zero Trust approach and framework to better control what
users can access and potentially halt an attack in its tracks.
