The French Connection: French Aerospace-Focused
CVE-2014-0322 Attack Shares Similarities with 2012
Capstone Turbine Activity
THE ADVERSARY LINE-UP

25 FEB 2014

MATT DAHL

Two weeks ago, news broke about strategic web compromise (SWC) activity on the website for
the U.S. organization, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). This activity leveraged exploit code for a
zero-day vulnerability now identiﬁed as CVE-2014-0322 and ultimately infected victims with
ZxShell malware. CrowdStrike Intelligence attributed this attack to the AURORA PANDA
adversary; however, the discovery of additional indicators revealed that another adversary was
leveraging the same vulnerability to carry out targeted attacks nearly a month before the VFW
attack occurred. This other activity appears to be focused on French aerospace and shares
similarities with a 2012 SWC campaign affecting the website of U.S.-based turbine manufacturer,
Capstone Turbine.

GIFAS-Related Activity

CrowdStrike Intelligence became aware of this additional activity after learning of a malicious
iframe located at savmpet[.]com. The iframe redirected visitors to gifas[.]assso[.]net, which was
hosting exploit code in two ﬁles (include.html and Tope.swf) as well as a malicious payload
(Erido.jpg).

Above are screenshots of the savmpet[.]com webpage and part of the page source showing the
date that it was last modiﬁed and the iframe redirect. The content of the page was taken from the
website of the French aerospace industries association, Groupement des industries françaises
aéronautiques et spatiales (GIFAS). The 17 January 2014 date on both the webpage and the
page source shows that it was created nearly a month before the VFW attack occurred

Victim exploitation occurred in the same manner as in the VFW activity, but the payload was
different. Instead of ZxShell malware connecting to AURORA PANDA-related infrastructure, it was
a malware variant known as Sakula connecting to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure at
oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.

French Aerospace Focus

This attack’s most obvious connection to French aerospace is the content taken from the GIFAS
website and the GIFAS-based domain used to host the exploit code and payload
(gifas[.]assso[.]net). However, a more in-depth look reveals additional connections.

First is the IP address 173.252.252.204, which hosted both savmpet[.]com and
gifas[.]assso[.]net. Several other domains were also pointed at this IP during the same time
frame, including two that contained the same content and malicious iframe as savmpet[.]com,
secure[.]safran-group[.]com, and icbcqsz[.]com.

Of particular interest was secure[.]safran-group[.]com. Safran is a France-based aerospace and
defense company with a focus on the design and production of aircraft engines and equipment.
The company owns the safran-group[.]com domain, and the fact that one of its subdomains was
pointed at a malicious IP address suggests that the adversary compromised Safran’s DNS.

The Sakula malware used in this attack contained an unusual and interesting component that
further indicates a focus on French aerospace. As part of the infection process, it added a
number of domains to the “host’s” ﬁle of victim machines.

The snecma[.]fr domain belongs to the Safran subsidiary, Snecma, that designs and builds
engines for civilian and military aircraft, and spacecraft. The domains listed appear to provide
remote access to the company’s employees and possibly third-party contractors.

The purpose of this component is unclear. It does not map these domains to malicious IP
addresses because the 217.108.170.0/24 range belongs to the company, which means it is not
meant to send victims directly to adversary infrastructure for credential collection. One possibility
is that it was meant to make the malware appear more legitimate. It has also been
hypothesized that this was done to ensure DNS connectivity to these particular domains;
however, it seems unlikely that victims would suffer signiﬁcant DNS connectivity issues, which
means that adding this component to the malware for that purpose would be somewhat
superﬂuous.

It should be noted that no victim logs related to this attack were discovered, so it is unclear who
the actual targets and victims were. Having the secure[.]safran-group[.]com domain pointed at a
malicious IP indicates that Safran suffered a DNS compromise, but no deeper network
compromise was observed. It is possible that the adversary desired to target the French
aerospace and defense sectors broadly, or possibly organizations in these sectors globally.

Similarities to 2012 Capstone Turbine SWC Attack

In January 2013, it was reported that the website for U.S.-based turbine manufacturer, Capstone
Turbine, had been compromised and was being used in a SWC attack leveraging an exploit for
the CVE-2012-4792. There are three primary similarities between the Capstone Turbine attack
and the recent French aerospace activity.

The ﬁrst, and most signiﬁcant, connection is the use of Sakula malware. In both campaigns,
Sakula variants were installed on successfully exploited machines. In Capstone Turbine, the
Sakula sample used (MD5 hash: 61fe6f4cb2c54511f0804b1417ab3bd2) connected to
web[.]vipreclod[.]com, and in the recent attack, the sample (MD5 hash:
c869c75ed1998294af3c676bdbd56851) connected to oa[.]ameteksen[.]com. Use of this malware
doesn’t appear to be widespread, but it is not yet clear whether only one group uses it, and
therefore its use alone does not necessarily indicate a particular adversary.

Another similarity is that GIFAS-based malicious domains are related to each incident. In the
more recent attack, the gifas[.]assso[.]net domain was used to host exploit code and the
malicious payload. The Capstone Turbine incident did not directly use a GIFAS-based domain,
but a deeper look at network indicators related to those observed in the Capstone incident reveals
two such domains: gifas[.]cechire[.]com and gifas[.]blogsite[.]org.

The third similarity between the two is the use of zero-days. The exploit used in Capstone
Turbine was a zero-day during the time it was active, just like the exploit used in the recent
French aerospace activity. This is a general similarity that does not create a deﬁnitive link
between the two attacks, but when viewed in conjunction with the use of the same malware and
GIFAS-based domains, it strengthens the connection.
