Overview

1.1 Executive Summary
In a recent emergency response activity, NSFOCUS Threat Intelligence center (NTI)
discovered a security event that featured NuggetPhantom, a modularized malware toolkit.
According to our observation, the organization behind this event made its debut at the end of
2016 in the blue screen of death (BSOD) event that targeted Tianyi Campus clients, and was
again involved in another security event that leveraged Tianyi Campus clients to mine
cryptocurrency at the end of 2017.
Having captured and analyzed malware carriers frequently used by this organization, we
believe that its malware toolkit has been highly modularized and so delivers high flexibility.
This toolkit not only features anti-antivirus techniques but also employs many concealment
approaches, as demonstrated in its capability of defeating security devices that work based on
behavior detection and traffic analysis.
As for target selection, this organization, as a disciple of the principle of "man is the measure
of security", took its first step by identifying less professional users according to the security
of their devices. Then it attempted to attack these users by exploiting an N-day
vulnerability with EternalBlue. Besides, to better hide itself and evade detection, the
organization tried to lower the impact of malware on users at the expense of financial gains.

1.2 Kill Chain
After finding that the operating system on a user's computer contains the EternalBlue
vulnerability, the attacker exploits this vulnerability to send Eternal_Blue_Payload to the
victim computer. Next, this payload drops all modules, which subsequently access the
download server to obtain their respective encrypted files and then dynamically decrypt them
in memory before executing related malicious functions. Following is a flowchart of the entire
attack process.

NuggetPhantom Analysis Report

Obviously, this attack procedure is fully consistent with the classic kill chain:


Reconnaissance: Through scanning and open-source data, the attacker finds a large
number of computers on the Internet that still contain the EternalBlue vulnerability.



Weaponization: The attacker crafts payloads specific to these vulnerable computers.



Delivery: The attacker loads the malware with all its modules to his/her own server.



Exploitation: The attacker exploits the EternalBlue vulnerability to attack targets one by
one by executing the downloader exploit payload.



Installation: The downloader exploit payload downloads malware and instructs it to
deploy its own modules.



Command and Control: The malware communicates with the attacker's command and
control (C&C) server to obtain instructions and cryptomining configurations.



Actions on Objective: The malware mines cryptocurrency and conducts distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

1.3 Scope of Impact
The domain *.woeswm.com, which is associated with the IP address 60.132.11.86
(98.126.200.58 after escaping) of the core C&C server used in this campaign, is found to have
initiated 18,933 domain resolution requests since June 20, 2018 to one DNS server under our
observation. From this number, we can infer that no less than 100,000 devices have been
infected around the world.

1.4 Development of the Hacking Organization
A look into sample behaviors and modules reused by the captured samples finds that the
BSOD event of Tianyi Campus clients at the end of 2016, the event of Tianyi Campus clients
planted with a cryptomining program at the end of 2017, and this event all point to the same
organization. The following table lists the development of this organization based on these
three events.

Neglected devices

For the success of its hacking activities, the organization began to test malware modules in
2016. However, at the beta test stage, the compatibility issue of the rootkit driver, a key
component of the malware, caused a large number of computers running Windows 10 to be
locked up with BSOD, thus exposing its traces and leading to the failure of the planned
campaign.
To avoid detection, the organization lay low over a long period of time subsequently. In mid2017, it began to reengineer the driver to follow the then trend by attempting some smallscale cryptomining activities. At the end of 2017, the organization staged a comeback by
planting the malware again in vulnerable Tianyi Campus clients. This time, its activities went
unnoticed thanks to the enhanced compatibility of the rootkit driver. However, due to design
flaws in its malicious functional modules, the cryptomining program consumed a large
amount of computing resources, showing itself to users and ending up with failure.
In the wake of this event, the organization went into hibernation again until July 2018, when it
began to turn back to cryptomining. This time, the organization made its activities more
difficult to detect by sacrificing two-thirds of gains from bot machines. In addition, based on a
good understanding of Chinese users' distrust of downloaded software, it chose to use an
efficient and mature exploit EternalBlue to plant malware into large quantities of unpatched
computers around the world. Its target also switched from college students who may have
knowledge in the related field to neglected computing devices. Such a switch was obviously a
result of deep consideration. We believe that the organization, after constantly learning from
past experience, has grown into a middle to high-end hacking organization, which is made up
of different roles with properly assigned duties to achieve defined objectives according to the
hacking trend.

Sample Analysis

2.1 High Level of Modularization
This malware toolkit has been highly modularized and so the tools can be flexibly configured.
In terms of functionality, the toolkit consists of three types of modules for deployment,
download, and function implementation respectively.
The deployment module initializes malicious configurations and loads the rootkit driver for
the purpose of hiding the malware. The download module obtains, loads, and calls functional
modules from the C&C server to fulfill attacker-specified tasks.
Thanks to modularization, the toolkit delivers high flexibility for attack task deployment. In
other words, the attacker can call different functional modules for different purposes. This
makes it rather difficult for us to have a holistic view of the attacker from a single attack
event.
The following sections analyze the three modules briefly to profile the attacker in the
technical aspect.

2.2 Careful Deployment to Evade Detection
The first file planted in victim computers is the deployment module, which employs the
following techniques and methods to hide the malware's malicious behavior and static
signature, thereby evading analysis and detection:


Execution upon restart: Through MSI configuration, the sample can execute malicious
activities only after users manually restart their computers. Such a design is for the
purpose of bypassing behavior-based detection in sandbox environments.



Code protection: The sample uses VMProtect to protect service programs planted in
victim computers to evade static analysis and antivirus software's detection on the one
hand and to make manual sample analysis more difficult on the other hand.

V4.1 (2018-10-08)

NuggetPhantom Analysis Report



File name check: The sample checks its own file name to see whether it is the same as
the hardcoded one as expected. If not, no malicious behavior will be performed. This can
help evade analysis by some sandboxes.



Drop during execution: To evade static analysis, the sample dynamically decompresses
and drops files and at the same time employs the process hollowing technique to inject
code.

V4.1 (2018-10-08)

NuggetPhantom Analysis Report



Driver-level hiding: By loading a driver to hook IRP_MJ_CREATE and inject
service.exe and regedit.exe, the sample hides service program files and registry keys,
thus making it more difficult to detect and remove the malware and extract a sample.

We associated this rootkit driver with another rootkit driver, which was found in the
BSOD event of Tianyi Campus clients at the end of 2016. Furthermore, the rootkit driver
used in the cryptomining event of Tianyi Campus clients shared the same certificate and
PDB file and so was deemed to be an update of the one used in 2016. On this ground, we
inferred that the three events were launched by the same organization.


Vulnerability blocking: The sample, by using the IPSec function of netsch.exe, runs the
following command lines to block ports 135, 139, and 445 to prevent other scanning
sources from exploiting the same vulnerability to compromise devices and contend for
computing resources:
−

Under protection of the preceding mechanisms, the deployment module injects
inject_downloader.dll into a child process, which seems to be launched by service.exe and is
actually not, and then drops and loads the download module in this child process.

2.3 Flexible Configuration to Hide True Identity
The download module obtains files and configurations of malware modules. The following
figure illustrates its communication logic.

V4.1 (2018-10-08)

NuggetPhantom Analysis Report

This module not only keeps a traditional C&C address pool to prepare for the situation where
a server may fail but also uses a special hiding method to prevent users from blocking
communication with C&C servers and defeat threat intelligence platforms that can associate
IP addresses resolved from domain names with samples. This method is called "address
escaping", whose working principle is quite simple:
The attacker first specifies a public server to query the domain name of a C&C server. After
obtaining the network address X (60.132.11.86), the mechanism subtracts the magic value
(0x305DA) from the hexadecimal representation of X before getting Y (98.126.200.58), the
real IP address of the C&C server. The download module communicates with Y to obtain
modules necessary for performing the task in question.

V4.1 (2018-10-08)

NuggetPhantom Analysis Report

In this process, the IP address directly resolved from the domain name of the C&C server is
not actually used for communication. Therefore, infected computers cannot stop
communicating with the C&C server by blocking this IP address. In addition, victims cannot
block access to the public DNS server for fear of affecting normal business. As a result,
malicious traffic is successfully exchanged between victim computers and the C&C server.
The sample compresses and encrypts the communication, which, after decryption, reads as
follows:
888$30$20180618$6$CpuGad$http://Up.Vohjtk.Com/RetGad/CpuGad/2018

Clearly, the sample uses this function to access a lot of URLs to download different
modules, which will be decompressed and dropped locally to perform various malicious
functions. Which modules are to be dropped is totally up to the attacker. Their programs take
the form of executables or scripts. At the same time, the sample obtains some IP addresses and
escapes them into real ones using the aforementioned address escaping method. Then the
sample encrypts and stores these addresses in the registry and uses them as C&C servers of
the cryptomining module to obtain the latest configuration information of the latter.
Following are real IP addresses obtained through address escaping:

2.4 Sacrifice of Present Gains to Remain Unnoticed
The cryptomining module is decompressed and executed by inject_loader.dll. Unlike other
cryptomining programs, this module employs some special tactics to enhance flexibility and
secrecy:


Dynamic configuration: The sample accesses C&C servers listed in the registry to
obtain configuration information of the cryptomining module in real time, including the
algorithm type, mining pool addresses, and online wallet user names. Users can hardly
block such cryptomining behavior by blacklisting known mining pool addresses.



Controlled resource usage: By setting cryptomining parameters, the attacker keeps the
CPU usage by the cryptomining module at a relatively low level (25%) to prevent users
from detecting it because of a sudden drop of computer performance.

According to our observation, C&C servers of the cryptomining module have issued the
following configuration information, where Wk is a fixed string of characters, which,
together with the attacker-specified offset, constitutes an online wallet user name. The offset,
if not configured, is 1000 by default.

The IP addresses listed in the table are all verified to be mining pools set up by the attacker by
using a leased virtual private server (VPS). These mining pool nodes are not configured with
gains query interfaces that are common with public mining pools. Therefore, the attacker
needs to log in to the server to query current gains by remote means such as remote desktop
connection (available on port 55588).

This ensures that other users cannot get more information about the attacker, such as his/her
total gains, Monero wallet addresses, and the number of miners, through mining pool
addresses, user names, and passwords disclosed in network traffic.
However, as the major functionality of the cryptomining module was reengineered from that
of XMRIG, the traffic generated is also in plaintext so that users can detect related sessions
and generate alerts on and block each new mining pool address.

V4.1 (2018-10-08)

NuggetPhantom Analysis Report

The cryptomining module's deployment process and coupling with the download module
indicate that it plays a lead role in this attack. At this stage, the attacker mainly aims to
persistently use victims' computing resources to mine cryptocurrency for personal gains.

2.5 All Covet, All Lose
Besides the cryptomining module that stars in this attack, we find an additional module for
launching DDoS attacks. This module is also decompressed and executed locally by
inject_loader.dll. It accesses the attacker-specified C&C server to download an independently
running EXE file to perform the assumed function.
Different from the cryptomining module that is tightly coupled with the download module
through C&C configuration, the DDoS module has its configuration information directly
hardcoded into a binary file so as to be executed independently of other modules without
needing any injection. For this reason, we determine that this module plays a secondary role
in this attack. Such a design results from the attacker's desire to maximize the value of bots by
using their computing resources to mine cryptocurrency on the one hand and using their
bandwidth resources to conduct DDoS attacks for additional gains on the other hand.
Unluckily, this module is not protected with any technique. Even worse, real IP addresses of
its C&C servers are not masked by means of address escaping, but hardcoded into a binary
file. In fact, it was due to this module that we were able to track down the attacker and make
breakthroughs in our analysis.
Observing the communication process, we found that this module used the same compression
and encryption algorithms and keys as other modules. Obviously, they were written by the
same author. Considering the difference between this module and other modules described in
preceding sections in security and its hardcoded information, we concluded that it was a beta
test version that implemented malicious functions without any protection mechanism.

Attacker Location

According to NTI, the IP address of the major C&C server used in these attacks is located in
the USA.

The result returned by NTI in response to our search reveals that names appearing on web
pages hosted at this IP address comply with the Chinese naming convention (scanning result
of July 16, 2018, the same date when the malicious sample was released). Therefore, a
conclusion can be drawn that this organization has long targeted victims in China.
(In the preceding figure, the parts masked indicate other hacking activities that the attacker
engaged in. Those who are interested in such information can go to nti.nsfocus.com to check
it out.)

Conclusion

From the preceding analysis, we can draw the following conclusions:


Vulnerability: The EternalBlue vulnerability, as a critical one disclosed in early 2017,
has been exploited by very efficient toolkits and has attracted a wide range of scanning
sources. Up to now, hackers' zeal for it has not abated as there are still a large number of
unpatched Windows devices worldwide.



Tools: Programs and tools used for malicious purposes are undergoing a major change in
their structure. Traditionally, all necessary functions are built into a package and used as
a whole. Now, they have functions modularized for higher flexibility. For one campaign,
an attacker needs only to plant a controlled loader program that seldom carries out
malicious activities but requests necessary modules in real time. Functional modules can
be loaded or uninstalled depending on the information collection progress, the purpose of
the task, and the trend of the hacking industry. Security devices analyze attacks only after
they actually happen. Such a reactive process makes it difficult to get a whole picture of
events no matter how extensive and intensive the analysis is.



Industry: Cryptomining is usually considered a hacking industry that has a low entry
barrier and does not require a high skill set. Therefore, antagonistic techniques seem to
be lacking in related malware. However, the case in question reveals that hacking
organizations lured by the lucrative business are generous with their spending on all sorts
of technical means against security products. This partly explains why the cryptomining
detection rate is dropping currently. A lower detection rate does not mean that fewer such
events have happened, but they are increasingly difficult to detect and perceive.



Organization: Full-fledged hacking organizations active in China focus more on
concealment and persistence of their malicious behavior. Their purpose has turned from
trying to control users' total resources to parasitizing users' computers without users'
knowledge. For the purpose of persistence, they are even willing to sacrifice some gains.
