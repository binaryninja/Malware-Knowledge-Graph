A critical new vulnerability in the Windows operating system is reportedly being exploited
in a limited number of attacks against targets in the US and Europe. The Microsoft
Windows OLE Package Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114)
allows attackers to embed Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) files from external
locations. The vulnerability can be exploited to download and install malware on to the
target’s computer. The vulnerability appears to have been used by a cyberespionage
group known as Sandworm to deliver Backdoor.Lancafdo.A (also known as the Black
Energy back door) to targeted organizations.
The vulnerability affects all versions of Windows from Windows Vista Service Pack 2 right
up to to Windows 8.1 and Windows Server versions 2008 and 2012. It relates to how
Windows handles OLE, a Microsoft technology that allows rich data from one document to
be embedded in another or a link to a document to be embedded in another. OLE is
generally used for embedding locally stored content, but this vulnerability enables the
unprompted download and execution of external files.
Active exploitation underway
The vulnerability was disclosed by iSIGHT Partners, which said that the vulnerability had
already been exploited in a small number of cyberespionage attacks against NATO,
several unnamed Ukrainian government organizations, a number of Western European
2/4

governmental organizations, companies operating in the energy sector, European
telecoms firms, and a US academic organization. According to our telemetry, attacks using
this payload have been underway since August. iSIGHT has attributed these attacks to an
advanced persistent threat (APT) group it has named Sandworm.
Attacks to date have seen targeted individuals receive a spear-phishing email containing a
malicious PowerPoint file attachment, which is detected by Symantec as Trojan.Mdropper.
The PowerPoint file contains two embedded OLE documents containing URLs. If the
targeted user opens the PowerPoint file, these URLs are contacted and two files are
downloaded, one .exe and one .inf, which will install malware on the computer. Symantec
detects this malware payload as Backdoor.Lancafdo.A.
Once installed on the target’s computer, this back door allows attackers to download and
install other malware. The malware may also download updates for itself, including an
information-stealing component.
While the current exploits are using PowerPoint files, given the nature of the vulnerability,
we may eventually see this exploit crop up in different Office file types such as Word
documents or Excel spreadsheets.
Symantec regards this vulnerability as critical, since it allows attackers to remotely run
code on the target’s computer. While it has been exploited on a limited basis in the wild,
other groups are likely to attempt to take advantage of it now that its existence has been
publicized.
Advice for businesses and consumers
Symantec advises all affected Windows users to take the following actions.
Immediately apply security patches once available from Microsoft
Ensure that your security software is up-to-date
Exercise caution when opening email attachments, particularly from unknown
sources
