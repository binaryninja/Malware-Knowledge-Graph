In 2021, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts noticed a growing number of anomalous spyware
attacks infecting ICS computers across the globe.
Although the malware used in these attacks belongs to well-known commodity spyware
families, these attacks stand out from the mainstream due to a very limited number of targets
in each attack and a very short lifetime of each malicious sample.
By the time the anomaly was detected, this had become a trend: around 21.2% of all
spyware samples blocked on ICS computers worldwide in H1 2021 were part of this new
limited-scope short-lifetime attack series and, at the same time, and, depending on the
region, up to one-sixth of all computers attacked with spyware were hit using this tactic.

In the process of researching the anomaly, we noticed a large set of campaigns that spread
from one industrial enterprise to another via hard-to-detect phishing emails disguised as the
victim organizations’ correspondence and abusing their corporate email systems to attack
through the contact lists of compromised mailboxes.
Overall, we have identified over 2,000 corporate email accounts belonging to industrial
companies abused as next-attack C2 servers as a result of successful malicious operations
of this type. Many more (over 7,000 in our estimation) have been stolen and sold on the web
or abused in other ways.
The full report is available on the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence portal.

“Anomalous” spyware attacks
In 2021, we noticed a curious anomaly in statistics on spyware threats blocked on ICS
computers. An analysis of 58,586 samples blocked in H1 2021 revealed that 12,420 (around
21.2%) of these samples had a sufficiently limited scope (i.e., the total number of machines
on which a sample was blocked, including non-ICS related computers) and short lifespan
(i.e., the number of days between the first and last sample detection dates), as shown in the
red rectangle on the chart below. It can be seen that the lifespan of the selected “anomalous”
attacks is limited to about 25 days. And at the same time, the number of attacked computers
is less than 100, of which 40-45% are ICS machines, while the rest are part of the same
organizations’ IT infrastructure.

2/23

Spyware samples blocked on ICS computers in H1 2021, by number of machines (targets)
and number of days passed since first seen
Although each of these “anomalous” spyware samples is very short-lived and is not widely
distributed, they account for a disproportionately large share of all spyware attacks.
In Asia, for example, every sixth computer attacked with spyware was hit with one of the
“anomalous” spyware samples (2.1% out of 11.9%, as shown on the graph below).
In Africa (2% out of 15.4%), the Middle East (1.3% out of 10.1%), Europe (0.7% out of 6.3%),
Russia (0.7% out of 6.8%), Australia and New Zealand (0.6% out of 5.6%), and North
America (0.5% out of 3.3%), about one spyware attack in ten involved one of the
“anomalous” spyware samples.
It seems that the ecosystem of commercial spyware attacks has launched a new and rapidly
evolving series of campaigns, shrinking the size of each attack and limiting the use of each
malware sample by quickly enforcing its replacement with a fresh-built one.

all spyware threats vs. “anomalous” samples
Notably, the majority of ICS computers on which “anomalous” spyware samples were
blocked in H1 2021 were from the manufacturing and ICS engineering & integration
industries. We believe this skew in data was due to the nature of these “anomalous” attacks,
which is described in the “C2 infrastructure” section of this report.

Spyware analysis

4/23

As regards the spyware samples used in “anomalous” attacks on ICS computers in H1 2021,
these are all the same breeds of commodity spyware such as Agent Tesla/Origin Logger,
HawkEye, Noon/Formbook, Masslogger, Snake Keylogger, Azorult, Lokibot, etc.
As normal, most of the spyware samples blocked had multiple layers of obfuscation folded
one into another. The technique is essentially based on hiding binary code into the resources
of an application. For example, one of the popular implementations involved encoding a
binary into an image using RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha channels) to store bytes.
As we discovered, the only significant difference between generic and anomalous spyware
samples was the types of C2 infrastructure used.

C2 infrastructure
Unlike generic spyware, the majority of “anomalous” samples were configured to use SMTPbased (rather than FTP or HTTP(s)) C2s as a one-way communication channel, which
means that was planned solely for theft.

Distribution of spyware samples by C2 type, ”anomalous” vs. generic
About 18.9% of all “anomalous” spyware was configured to connect to a server owned by
some victim industrial enterprise.

5/23

Distribution of “anomalous” spyware samples by hosting types of SMTP-based C2
infrastructure
Almost all (99.8%) of the C2 servers found in the configuration of “anomalous” spyware
samples were deployed in just three regions – Asia, Europe, and North America.

C2 infrastructure, TOP 3 regions
We also noticed that the majority of C2s, including those deployed on abused infrastructure
owned by industrial companies, were deployed on servers in North America.
That was an unexpected finding since 34.6% of attacked ICS computers belong to Asian
companies. But the analysis revealed that a surprisingly large number of mid-size industrial
companies in Asia have their public-access infrastructure, such as DNS, corporate web and
email servers, hosted on North American rather than Asian servers (rented directly from
North American providers or from various Asian providers that in fact “provide” infrastructure
made available to them by North American providers).

6/23

Tactics, techniques, and procedures
We believe that initially stolen data is used by threat operators primarily to spread the attack
inside the local network of the attacked organization (via phishing emails) and to attack other
organizations in order to collect more credentials.
An analysis of source and destination addresses in phishing emails sent by threat operators
and of newly discovered C2s (i.e., the conversion of exfiltrated credentials to new C2s)
reveals the tactics used to spread the attack from a compromised industrial enterprise to its
business and operational partner organizations. These tactics are shown in the diagram
below.

7/23

Credential collection and abuse by threat actors
An example of a phishing email sent by a threat operator as a result of abusing stolen
credentials (email account) of a victim user is shown below. The email was sent via the
compromised organization’s email server from the compromised user’s account to targets
taken from the compromised user’s contact list. The targets included 28 email accounts from
7 industrial companies.

8/23

Overall, as part of this research, we identified over 2,000 abused (i.e., used as C2s by
spyware) email accounts owned by industrial companies. We estimate the total number of
corporate email accounts whose credentials were stolen as a result of these attacks to be
over 7,000.

Email sent as part of an attack propagated by abusing a victim’s contact list
For some actors, the next-stage activity involved attacking their victims using the business
email compromise technique, which is designed to enable the attackers to commit fraud (by
analyzing business correspondence and hijacking selected banking transactions). An
example of emails used in such attacks is shown below.

9/23

Fraudulent email sent as part of a business email compromise attack
Other actors focus on stealing credentials for sale, including:
Credentials for personal financial services such as online banking accounts, wallets,
crypto exchanges, etc.;
Credentials for social networks and other public internet services;
Credentials for corporate network access services (SMTP, SSH, RDP, VPN, etc.).

10/23

Email with RDP credentials sent by spyware reporting back to the attackers
Based on screenshots collected by spyware and other indirect evidence we have found, we
can state that some malware operators have a particular interest in industrial companies and
their infrastructure. This interest can be explained by significant differences in the prices of
different account types in web marketplaces (see below).

11/23

Screenshot captured by spyware
At this stage in our research, the “anomaly” discovered early on makes perfect sense: the
“anomalous” samples we discovered are so limited in scope and have such a short lifespan
because threat actors generate unique samples (with a specific C2 configuration) for each
phishing email, which is usually limited to a subset of addresses from the previous-stage
victim’s contact list.
When a compromised email account is abused as a C2, the C2 traffic is normally detected by
an antispam solution and moved to the spam folder, where in most cases it remains
unnoticed until the folder is cleaned. Evading antispam detection is not in the interests of the
malicious actors, as this would bring victims’ attention to C2 traffic, signaling compromise.
That’s how malicious actors use cybersecurity-related technology to their advantage.
The Recommendations section of this report contains some patterns which could be used to
identify the compromise of an email account.

Malware operators
An analysis of data on some malware operators covered by our research on “anomalous”
spyware attacks has shed some light on the bigger picture of credential gathering campaigns
run by hundreds of independent operators.

12/23

Various spyware builders have a feature for testing the availability and accessibility of a C2
at the configuration phase. In the case of an SMTP C2, they simply send and retrieve a test
message.

Screenshot of the OriginLogger builder tool after successfully testing the availability of an
SMTP C2 configuration
It can be seen in the screenshot of a C2 test message below that such messages can
provide useful information about the infrastructure used by malware operators: the subject
field of the test email contains the user name, the computer name, and the IP address of the
machine from which the email was sent.

13/23

C2 test message used as a verification email
It has been shown by other researchers that builder features can include sending certain
data to the malware developer, which means that malware developers can use them to spy
on their customers. Other builders that send a greeting email to the spyware operator, such
as HawkEye, don’t include much information about the malware operator.

An analysis of some information on malware operators (most probably leaked when they
were testing their malware on the PCs they use for their other day-to-day activities) allowed
us to learn more about the TTPs of malware operators, the backend infrastructure they used
to prepair their attacks, and the various services they used over the internet as part of their
“work routine”, e.g., to rent the infrastructure, communicate with other cybergangsters or sell
the loot.
The analysis has also revealed that many of these operators may be connected with African
countries.

Malware developers and Spyware-as-a-Service providers
In the past 5 years, since the source code of some popular spyware programs was made
public, it has become highly available in online shops in the form of a service – developers
sell a license for a malware builder rather than for malware as a product.

where Origin logger (aka Agensla) is being sold.
In some cases, what malware developers sell is not a malware builder but access to
infrastructure preconfigured to build the malware, at the same time advertising some
additional services on top of it.

Many spyware developers advertise their products on social networks, forums, and chats;
they even make video tutorials. We have analyzed all available sources of information
published by many malware developers (those who are selling the spyware builders detected
on ICS computers in 2021). As part of this research, we were able to track “anomalous”
spyware attacks through their operators down to the specific MaaS infrastructure, its
providers and developers. Further analysis of social networks, chats, and forums where
these operators and developers communicate revealed that a significant proportion of these
independent malware developers and service providers are likely to speak Russian (i.e., they
may potentially be connected with post-Soviet states) and Turkish.
This observation is based on various facts:

Probable time zone based on the time of day when the malware developers are active
in chats/forums;
Probable locale based on screenshots, videos, and messages shared by the malware
developers.

Example of time zone analysis based on chat activity of a malware developer
Another example is a video tutorial created by an OriginLogger seller. The interface of his
Yandex mail account (seen on his video) is set to the Turkish locale. Moreover, the author did
not use the blur effect in the video properly to hide the data collected by the spyware he was
demonstrating. An analysis of URLs collected by the spyware from the demonstrators’ web
browser shows he has accounts on some Turkish forums and even an account with a Turkish
university.

Marketplaces
Along with some insights about the malware services used by threat operators (as well as
malware developers and service providers), data on malware operators allows us to identify
one of the routines used to monetize credential harvesting attacks (aside from business
email compromise) – selling the stolen credentials in various marketplaces.
Our analysis of services and marketplaces used by the malware operators showed that
credential harvesting campaigns are a building block of a huge pipeline of various malicious
services, from the development of malware and its infrastructure to commerce platforms

trading a wide variety of access to corporate networks of any choice.
In this research, we identified over 25 different marketplaces where data stolen in the
credential gathering campaigns targeting industrial companies that we investigated was
being sold. At these markets, various sellers offer thousands of RDP, SMTP, SSH, cPanel,
and email accounts, as well as malware, fraud schemes, and samples of emails and
webpages for social engineering.

marketplace that sells over 8,000 RDPs
An analysis of offers and prices has revealed a trend: access to corporate networks of
industrial enterprises (via RDP, SSH, SMTP, etc.) is priced 8-10 times higher than access to
cloud hosting infrastructures such as AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure, etc.
A marketplace normally provides no information on sellers except their seller IDs. An
analysis of the entire portfolio of accounts offered by a seller could show that seller’s focus
on some particular types of accounts – some mainly offer accounts for corporate networks
(e.g., networks of industrial companies).

Offers of RDP access to networks of some industrial companies
A statistical analysis of metadata for over 50,000 compromised RDP accounts sold in
marketplaces shows that 1,954 accounts (3.9%) belong to industrial companies.

Compromised RDP accounts sold in marketplaces by types
Statistics on compromised industrial enterprise accounts by country show that over 46% of
accounts sold in marketplaces are owned by companies in the US, while owners of the rest
are located in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

Conclusion
The implementation of security measures and controls in IT and OT infrastructures
worldwide forces the cybercriminal ecosystem to evolve. One of the changes in the
approaches of malicious actors that we have seen is moving away from mass-scale attacks
towards small-scale and very short-lived (in terms of both the C2 infrastructure and the
malware samples) series of attacks. Another tactic was to propagate the attacks from inside
the victim’s infrastructure, thereby “legitimizing” the phishing email traffic. Abusing legitimate
mailboxes (compromised at a previous attack stage) enables the actors to rapidly change
20/23

their C2s and limit detection by network security solutions. What makes this possible for
threat actors is the ubiquitous use of antispam technologies in the modern mail systems of
their victims.
This tactic has proved so effective that, depending on the region, it was used to attack up to
one-sixth of all ICS computers we saw attacked with spyware during H1 2021.
According to our telemetry, more than 2,000 industrial organizations worldwide have been
incorporated into the malicious infrastructure and used by cyber gangs to spread the attack
to their contact organizations and business partners. According to our estimate, the C2
conversion rate is roughly 1/4, which gives us at least 7,000 corporate accounts
compromised during the research period. The amount of data stolen from these accounts is
hard to estimate.
There are many ways in which this data can be abused, including by the more devastating
actors, such as ransomware gangs and APT groups. As an analysis of web marketplaces
shows, the demand is highest for credentials that provide access to internal systems of
enterprises. And the supply seems to be meeting the demand, as we counted almost 2,000
RDP accounts for industrial enterprises being sold in marketplaces during the analysis
period.

Recommendations
We recommend taking the following measures to ensure adequate protection of an industrial
enterprise, its partner network operations, and business:
Consider implementing two-factor authentication for corporate email access and other
internet-facing services (including RDP, VPN-SSL gateways, etc.) that could be used
by an attacker to gain access to your company’s internal infrastructure and businesscritical data.
Make sure that all the endpoints, both on IT and OT networks, are protected with a
modern endpoint security solution that is properly configured and is kept up-to-date.
Regularly train your personnel to handle their incoming emails securely and to protect
their systems from malware that email attachments may contain
Regularly check spam folders instead of just emptying them
Monitor the exposure of your organization’s accounts to the web
Consider using sandbox solutions designed to automatically test attachments in
inbound email traffic; make sure your sandbox solution is configured not to skip emails
from “trusted” sources, including partner and contact organizations. No one is 100%
protected from a compromise.
Test attachments in outbound emails, as well. This could give you a chance to realize
you’re compromised.
