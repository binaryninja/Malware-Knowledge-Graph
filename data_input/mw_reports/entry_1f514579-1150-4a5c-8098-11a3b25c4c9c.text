Saefko: A new multi-layered RAT
zscaler.com/blogs/research/saefko-new-multi-layered-rat

Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team came across a new remote-access trojan (RAT) for sale on the dark
web. The RAT, called Saefko, is written in .NET and has multiple functionalities. This blog provides a detailed
analysis of this piece of malware, including its HTTP, IRC, and data stealing and spreading module.

Background
A RAT is a type of malware that includes a backdoor for remote administrative control of the targeted
computer. RATs are usually downloaded as a result of a user opening an email attachment or downloading an
application or a game that has been infected. Because a RAT enables administrative control, the intruder can
do just about anything on the targeted computer, such as monitoring user behavior by logging keystrokes,
accessing confidential information, activating the system's webcam, taking screenshots, formatting drives, and
more.
Upon successful infection, the Saefko RAT stays in the background and executes every time the user logs in.
It fetches the chrome browser history looking for specific types of activities, such as those involving credit
cards, business, social media, gaming, cryptocurrency, shopping, and more. It sends the data it has collected
to its command-and-control (C&C) server and requests for further instructions. The C&C instructs the malware
to provide system information and the RAT will begin to collect a range of data including screenshot,videos,
keystroke logs and more. The C&C can also instruct the malware to download additional payload onto the
infected system.
RATs present a unique business threat. They have the ability to steal a lot of data without being detected and
spread to other systems across the network. The ThreatLabZ team also detonated the Saefko RAT in the
Zscaler Cloud Sandbox to determine its functionality, communications, and the potential threat.

Technical Analysis of the Saefko RAT
Saefko malware unpacks itself and places the saefkoagent.exe file in
“/%AppData%/Roaming/SaefkoAgent.exe” and executes it. It also copies itself
to “/%AppData%/Roaming/windows.exe” and "/%AppData%/Local/explorer.exe” and executes them.
Autostart Key

1/14

The Saefko malware creates a startup key to execute the malware at every login. If it is executing from an
admin account, it creates the following registry key:
“HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\explorer”
Otherwise, it creates a registry key in the following path:
“HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\explorer”
Functionality
Saefko first checks to see whether the internet connection is active by connecting to
“clients3.google.com/generate_204”. It then uses a unique technique to identify if the infected system contains
any vital information. It fetches the browser history and searches for particular websites that have been visited
by the user and makes a count based on the categories mentioned below. From the counts, the attacker can
determine which systems it should target first from all the infected systems.

The list of different categories it searches include:

5/14

After getting an "ok" response from the server, Saefko begins the "StartServices" function, which has
four different infection modules:
HTTPClinet
IRCHelper
KEYLogger
StartLocalServices (USB spreading)

HTTP Clinet
(Possible misspelling of HTTP Client by the author)
The RAT sends a request to the server, requesting for a new task. It sends a command “UpdateAndGetTask”
and also sends other information, including machine_ID, machine_os, and privateip, as shown below:

6/14

The task is the URL from which the malware downloaded the new payload and executed it on the infected
machine.

Key Logger
The malware uses the SetWindowsHookEx API for capturing keystrokes. It stores the captured keystrokes into
a “log.txt” file. The filepath is: “\%AppData%\Local\log.txt.”

IRC Helper
First, the malware disconnects the current IRC connection. Then, it sends status information to the C&C as
shown below:

7/14

pass: password
command: UpdateHTTPIRCStatus
machine_id: unique id sent by C&C in an earlier request
irc_status: 1
Next malware fetch
Serverlist: it selects a server from the list below.

Saefko connects to one of these servers and waits for a response. In the response, it checks for “T_T” string
and any separate messages using that string. Below is the list of IRC functions that the RAT can perform.
According to the command it receives, Saefko will respond with corresponding data.

IP, city, region, country, latitude and longitude

keylogs

Encode the keylog file (log.txt) using base64 and send it to C&C

uninstall

Camlist
Saefko also searches for the following payloads in the system:
AForge.dll
AForge.Video.DirectShow.dll
AForge.Video.dll
Sqlite3.dll
If these files are not present, the malware sends a request to the C&C to download these files. Next, it
searches for a list of video input devices on the targeted system and sends the related information to the C&C.

10/14

Snapshot
Saefko also captures videos from the device present on the system, encodes the video frame with Base64
and sends it to the C&C.

Start USB Service
Saefko checks to see if the drive type is either removable or networked, after which it starts the infection and
copies the files below onto a removable drive.
Sas.exe
USBStart.exe
11/14

usbspread.vbs
Sas.exe is a copy of the malware itself. USBStart.exe is fetched from the resource section of the main binary.
It contains code to execute Sas.exe. It creates a usbspread.vbs file then executes it. It searches every
directory and all the files and creates a "lnk" file for each file and directory with a target path USBStart.exe file.
When the removable device is plugged in any other system, the user is tricked into clicking a lnk file as the
main files and folder are hidden. Lnk file executes the USBStart.exe that ends up executing Sas.exe which is
the main payload. So it futher infect other Systems.
Below is the code of the usbspread.vbs file:

One online forum has an ad for a cracked Saefko RAT tool as shown below. It is a multi-protocol, multioperating system remote administration tool that can be used to launch the malware on Windows and Android
devices.

12/14

Conclusion
To protect systems from RATs, users must refrain from downloading programs or opening attachments that
aren't from a trusted source. At the administrative level, it's always a good idea to block unused ports, turn off
unused services, and monitor outgoing traffic. Attackers are often careful to prevent the malware from doing
too much activity at once, which would slow down the system and possibly attract the attention of the user and
IT.

Zscaler ThreatLabZ team continues to monitor this threat and others to ensure that Zscaler customers are
protected.
