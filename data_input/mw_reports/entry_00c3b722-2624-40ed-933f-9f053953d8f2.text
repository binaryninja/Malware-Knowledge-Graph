U.S. system-on-chip (SOC) maker company MaxLinear disclosed that some of its computing
systems were encrypted by Maze Ransomware operators last month, after an initial breach
that took place around April 15.
MaxLinear is a New York Stock Exchange-traded company and a provider of RF, analog, and
mixed-signal integrated circuits for connected home, industrial, and infrastructure
applications.
In April 2020, MaxLinear announced net revenue of $62 million for the first quarter of 2020,
and its CEO, Kishore Seendripu, shared plans to "acquire Intel’s Home Gateway Platform
Division in the third quarter of this year."

Data breach reported after stolen data leaked online
In a data breach notification sent to affected individuals on June 10 and seen by
BleepingComputer, MaxLinear states that the attack was discovered on May 24.

"We immediately took all systems offline, retained third-party cybersecurity experts to aid in
our investigation, contacted law enforcement, and worked to safely restore systems in a
manner that protected the security of information on our systems," the letter reads.
"Our investigation to-date has identified evidence of unauthorized access to our systems
from approximately April 15, 2020, until May 24, 2020."
MaxLinear says that it was able to restore some of the systems affected during the attack
and its IT staff is still working on bringing back up the rest.
On June 15, Maze Ransomware leaked 10.3GB of accounting and financial information out
of the over 1TB of data allegedly stolen before encrypting MaxLinear's systems.

Social Security number, date of birth, work location, compensation and benefit information,
dependent, and date of employment."
The company also states that the incident has led to an enterprise-wide password reset and
that the breach was disclosed to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
According to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on
June 16, as discovered by Reuters, the attack did not affect shipment, order fulfillment, and
production capabilities, and MaxLinear doesn't plan to pay the ransom Maze Ransomware
requested to stop leaking the stolen data.
The chipmaker said in the SEC filing that, although the company would incur extra costs due
to the forensic investigation and systems remediation following the attack, it does not
anticipate "that the incident will materially or adversely affect our operating expenses."
"We carry cybersecurity insurance, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits,"
MaxLinear said.
