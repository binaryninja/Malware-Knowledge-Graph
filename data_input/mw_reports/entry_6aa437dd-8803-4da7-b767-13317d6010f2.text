Industrial Control Systems
Vulnerability & Risk Self-Assessment Aid
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Key Points
• The primary goal is mission assurance.
• The primary focus is on risk management.
• The primary audience is the installation commander, with his or her staff as close
secondary.
• The primary intent is to facilitate self-assessment of Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
security posture vis-à-vis missions’ priorities.
• The primary approach is generic, enabling broad (Joint/all Services) utility.
One of the essential responsibilities of the installation commander and supporting staff is to
manage risks to establish optimal conditions for assuring successful accomplishment of
assigned missions every day. Although not always obvious, many missions depend on the
unfailing functioning of ICS and therefore on the security of those systems.
A mission assured today is never taken for granted as assured tomorrow. Mission assurance
demands constant vigilance along with proactive risk management. Risks come in myriad
shapes and sizes—some enduring, some sporadic and situational, others appearing without
warning. ICS represent only one set among a vast array of mission vulnerabilities and risks, an
array that often competes for resources and, therefore, requires prioritization of management
actions.
This handbook is intended for use primarily by Department of Defense (DOD) installation
commanders, supported by staff members, as a management tool to self-assess,1 prioritize,
and manage mission-related vulnerabilities and risks that may be exposed or created by
connectivity to ICS. ICS include a variety of systems or mechanisms used to monitor and/or
operate critical infrastructure elements, such as electricity, water, natural gas, fuels, entry and
access (doors, buildings, gates), heating & air-conditioning, runway lighting, etc. Other terms

1

Other entities and programs are available to conduct formal and very thorough technical assessments, but those
must be coordinated, scheduled, and resourced (i.e., funded). This aid provides an ability to conduct selfassessments when/as necessary or desired, and thereby, also the ability to prioritize and manage the resources
required to address identified vulnerabilities and risks.

1

often heard include SCADA, DCS, or EMCS.2 Throughout this book the term “ICS” is used as
encompassing such variations.
This book is intentionally generic. Whatever the category of ICS, the approach to vulnerability
assessment and risk management is similar. The applicability of actions recommended here
may be extended to any DOD military installation regardless of the specific categories of ICS
encountered. In keeping with the generic approach and due primarily to the unique nature of
each installation’s infrastructure, beyond a couple of exceptions there are no checklists,
standard operating procedures (SOP), or similar sets of lock-step actions provided here.
However, a risk management team using the handbook likely will want to develop checklists
tailored to their specific circumstances.
Among other purposes, this handbook is intended to increase awareness of how a threat
related to the ICS itself translates into a threat to the mission, either directly through the ICS or
circuitously via network connections. Every military installation has numerous mission-support
processes and systems controlled by, or that otherwise depend on, ICS. Every connection or
access point represents potential vulnerabilities and, therefore, risks to the system under
control (i.e., electrical, water, emergency services, etc.), which can escalate quickly to adverse
impact on mission essential functions (MEF) and mission accomplishment.
Fundamentally then, this handbook is provided to help the installation leadership conduct a risk
self-assessment focused on ICS and supported missions and then implement plans to manage
that risk. Most of the information contained herein is not unique to this publication. Two
unique aspects are: (1) the aggregation of disparate information into one place, distilling
essentials, and tailoring to DOD installation leadership; and (2) bringing cyber/information
technology (IT), civil engineers, public works, and mission operators together with a singular
focus on ICS security in support of missions. This handbook (via Appendices) also points to
additional resources.
The key set of activities—one exception to the “no checklists” approach—is found under the
heading “ICS Security Assessment Process.” Succinctly the process consists of eight steps,
which if implemented with deliberation and in a team environment, will set the success
conditions for all other actions recommended or suggested within this handbook (see Figure 1).
This set of eight steps represents the core of the handbook. All other information herein is
intended to support implementation of those eight steps.

SCADA= Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition; DCS = Distributed Control System; EMCS = Energy
Management Control System. Other variations exist; for example, building control systems.

Before explaining the eight-step assessment process, the handbook provides introductory,
informative and supporting information. Closely aligned with and serving as companion to the
“Assessment Process” is a section titled “Framework for Successful ICS Defense.” If the
installation does not already have a single ICS manager and/or team, the “Framework” should
be considered prior to engaging on the eight-step process.

INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS “101”
Key Point
• Understanding ICS is not difficult; the challenge is to understand the ICS relationship to
missions.
Fundamentally Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are systems and mechanisms that control flow.
ICS control flow of electricity, fluids, gases, air, traffic, and even people. They are the
computer-controlled electro-mechanical systems that ensure installation infrastructure services
are delivered when and where required to accomplish the mission. In the electric
infrastructure, they control actions such as opening and closing switches; for water, they open
and close valves; for buildings, they control access to various doors as well as operation of the
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.
The term “Industrial Control System” is broad; specific instances of ICS may be called
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control System (DCS), Energy
Management Control System (EMCS), Emergency Medical Service (EMS), or other terms but all
perform the same fundamental function. Also, on DOD installations, ICS are associated
primarily with infrastructure elements; therefore, though not technically accurate, they may be
referred to as “Infrastructure” vice “Industrial” control systems. The hardware components
that comprise an ICS usually are classed as operational technology (OT) versus information
technology (IT), which refers to (among other things) the computer equipment that sits on
nearly every desk. Another term used in this domain is Platform Information Technology (PIT),3
(and PITI, with the ‘I’ referring to interconnect, or connected to the network) although ICS are
only one sub-category of PIT, which also includes weapons systems, aircraft, vehicles, buildings,
etc. Terminology is not that critical. What is important is to know that ICS are critical to the
mission.
You frequently have used an ICS—though not by that term—in your home. It is called a
“thermostat.” The most simple of thermostats may not be so obvious as an ICS, but the more
sophisticated can be programmed to automatically control the flow of air (heated, cooled, or
just fan) by day, time, room, zone, etc. The most advanced allow the owner to monitor and
operate the system over an Internet connection or Wi-Fi, using a Smartphone or tablet.
The “Smart Grid,” once fully implemented, will allow your utility company to operate your
thermostat remotely. The thermostat monitors temperatures (and some include humidity) and
3

“PIT” is used more by the Air Force and to a lesser extent by the Navy. At the DoD level, PIT is addressed mostly
under information assurance (IA) guidance, such as DODI 8500.2. See the Glossary for a DOD definition of PIT.

5

then operates the electro-mechanical equipment (furnace, air conditioner, fan) to respond to
the preset conditions you have selected. If the thermostat fails—even though the mechanicals
are in perfect operating condition—the mission (cool, heat) fails. This same concept translates
to the installation’s missions: if the ICS fails the mission can fail, although the direct cause and
effect may not always be so obvious.
ICS typically are not visible to the general population. The control devices themselves are
behind panels, behind walls, inside cabinets, under floors, under roads; the master control
computers more often reside in a room in a civil engineer (CE) or public works (PW) facility.
Because they are essentially invisible to all but CE and PW, and are considered as simply
infrastructure elements, ICS often are overlooked when assessing mission dependencies.
Regardless of where they physically reside or who directly operates the ICS, every person and
every mission on the installation is a stakeholder in their properly functioning.
While the ICS field (vs. control room) elements consist of mostly electro-mechanical devices,
some are actually computers that control other field devices and communicate with other
computers in the system with minimal human interaction. The most common example of this
type is the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).4 PLCs (and their cousins, Remote Terminal
Units or RTU) are very important because they are computers, typically not under direct human
supervision, and offer multiple pathways (e.g., wireless, modem, Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus
[USB]) for connecting to both the controlled infrastructure and the network. This combination
of characteristics makes the PLC an especially vulnerable node in the ICS.
At the front end—the control center—is where most of the computers (servers, system
interfaces, etc.) and, more critically, connection to other networks reside. While PLCs/RTUs
may become connected (autonomously or by human intervention) for intermittent periods,
control center computers may be continuously connected5 to the Non-secure Internet Protocol
Router Network (NIPRNet), other elements of the Global Information Grid (GIG), and/or an
Internet Service Provider (ISP). It is especially at this node that ICS should be treated with the
same security considerations as with IT.
Whether an ICS element is continuously or only intermittently connected presents the same
fundamental security issue. Anytime an element is connected to a network, even if for only
4

Many will recall that a Siemens PLC was the primary target for the Stuxnet code that impacted the centrifuges in
the Iranian nuclear processing facility at Natanz in 2010. This same PLC (or variants) can be found in the critical
infrastructures on numerous DOD installations. See an informative Wikipedia article on Stuxnet here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet
5
Another term used here is PIT-I, or PIT-Interconnect—that juncture where the ICS (or OT) connects with the IT
network. For detail on PIT and PIT-I, in addition to DODI 8500.2, see: DODD 8500.01E; AFI 33-210 with AFGM2.2;
AFCESA ETL 11-1; DON CIO Memo 02-10 and Enclosures.

brief instances, it is vulnerable to destructive attack, compromise, or manipulation. Therefore,
when assessing risk the key question is not “Is it connected?” but “Is it connect-able?”
Network mapping (via software) will not reveal such potential connectivity; only a physical,
visual inspection of an element by a knowledgeable expert (more likely an IT than a CE or PW
person) will yield specific information on what type of connection ports exist on what elements.
Where the location of an element makes visual inspection impractical or impossible, use the
manufacturer’s or vendor’s published manuals for that specific piece of equipment.
Understanding the fundamentals of ICS is not difficult. The challenge is in understanding the
dependencies of mission on ICS and therefore, appropriately managing the risks to the ICS and
to the missions they support. This handbook is intended to assist the commander and staff in
gaining that understanding.

HANDBOOK AUTHORITIES
Key Point:
• The handbook reflects breadth and depth of ICS community expertise.
This handbook was developed based on a broad collection of authoritative sources;6 underwent
field testing to validate the framework and applicability at the installation command level; was
reviewed by a Joint Warfighter Advisory Group (JWAG7) to verify broad (i.e., Joint) applicability;
and received direct input by a broad-based selection of ICS and risk management subject
matter experts (SME). Users of this handbook will gain even greater value by referencing
current publications of primary sources. Some of the major publications are listed in Appendix
A, References. Note that while this handbook is advisory, many of the sources are authoritative
and/or directive.

DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ICS AND IT
Key Point:
• ICS and IT share similarities, but also have unique characteristics.
Fundamentally ICS security is a combination of IA, cyber security, physical security, and
operations security (OPSEC). This same combination is applicable to IT, so is there any
difference between ICS and IT? Yes. One key distinction between ICS and other IT
architectures is that the physical world can be impacted disastrously by malicious (or only
accidental) manipulation of the ICS. For example, with IT there typically is linkage with only
other IT components; with ICS the linkage can be to the electric grid, powering other critical
assets, as well as to other infrastructure elements. This gives rise to another primary
distinction, namely that ICS must always be available while “pure” IT can survive downtimes.
Another important difference is in the “refresh” rates of the technologies: IT tends to turn over
in three years or less while OT (ICS) can be on a 20-year cycle. Why is this important to know?

Processing Standards (FIPS); and numerous SMEs who are members of or closely associated with the DoD.

JWAG participants may differ from meeting-to-meeting, but broadly represent stakeholders in the outcome or
product of a specified Joint activity or project. For this handbook the initial JWAG included representatives from
United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), Northern Command (NORTHCOM), AFCESA, INL, Sandia National
Laboratory (SNL), and various CE and communications experts from both Army and Air Force elements of Joint
Base San Antonio.

The long refresh cycle of ICS results in hardware, software, and operating systems no longer
supported by vendors. The impacts of lack of support include: woefully stale malware
detection programs, operating systems that cannot handle newer (and more efficient/effective)
software programs, and hardware that may be on the verge of catastrophic failure with no
backup or failover equipment available.
The following extract from NIST Special Publication 800-828 provides an excellent review of not
only the distinctions but also the similarities and how OT (such as ICS) and IT are converging.
“Initially, ICS had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT)
systems in that ICS were isolated systems running proprietary control protocols
using specialized hardware and software. Widely available, low-cost Internet
Protocol (IP) devices are now replacing proprietary solutions, which increases
the possibility of cyber security vulnerabilities and incidents. As ICS are adopting
IT solutions to promote corporate business systems connectivity and remote
access capabilities, and are being designed and implemented using industry
standard computers, operating systems (OS) and network protocols, they are
starting to resemble IT systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but
it provides significantly less isolation for ICS from the outside world than
predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure these systems. While
security solutions have been designed to deal with these security issues in typical
IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same
solutions to ICS environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed
that are tailored to the ICS environment.
“Although some characteristics are similar, ICS also have characteristics that
differ from traditional information processing systems. Many of these
differences stem from the fact that logic executing in ICS has a direct affect on
the physical world. Some of these characteristics include significant risk to the
health and safety of human lives and serious damage to the environment, as well
as serious financial issues such as production losses, negative impact to a
nation’s economy, and compromise of proprietary information. ICS have unique
performance and reliability requirements and often use operating systems and
applications that may be considered unconventional to typical IT personnel.
Furthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency sometimes conflict with security
in the design and operation of control systems.

Originally, ICS implementations were susceptible primarily to local threats
because many of their components were in physically secured areas and the
components were not connected to IT networks or systems. However, the trend
toward integrating ICS systems with IT networks provides significantly less
isolation for ICS from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a
greater need to secure these systems from remote, external threats. Also, the
increasing use of wireless networking places ICS implementations at greater risk
from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have
direct physical access to the equipment. Threats to control systems can come
from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups,
disgruntled employees, malicious intruders, complexities, accidents, natural
disasters as well as malicious or accidental actions by insiders. ICS security
objectives typically follow the priority of availability, integrity and confidentiality,
in that order.”
Distinctions between ICS and IT aside, from a purely technical security standpoint, ICS may be
considered on par with IT or IA vis-à-vis security challenges, albeit with warnings about use of
certain software tools on the networks.9

THREATS
Key Point:
• Threats are global but assessments must be local.
What threats could be posed to an installation’s mission by or through the ICS? This is an
essential question, but one that cannot be answered specifically in an unclassified venue or
simplistically in any venue. Generically, threats fall into categories similar to IT and/or cyber:
terrorist, criminal, insider, environmental, etc. Use of this self-assessment handbook can lead
to a deeper understanding of the infrastructure and establish mitigation conditions whereby
specific threats may be identified. But even without specific threats known many risks can be

9

Caveat emptor with respect to software tools. Software applications that test, penetrate, scan, characterize,
and/or defend networks should be considered equivalent to “loaded weapons” with respect to control systems.
Some tools that are entirely “safe” when used on IT networks have been demonstrated both in the field and under
controlled conditions to have negative, even catastrophic effects on ICS networks. If such tools are considered for
use on ICS, the decision must be an informed one and the tool operator must be a SME who understands potential
effects of that tool on an ICS. Furthermore, any such use must be coordinated with the relevant IT agency (e.g.,
Service CERT) because tool use on the connected ICS could trip various IT network defense mechanisms (firewalls,
intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), etc).

10

identified and managed. In other words, this handbook can help to establish a more effective
and efficient security posture to conduct formal threat assessments.
The Security Incidents Organization in a 2009 survey (not specific to DOD) assessed that roughly
75% of ICS incidents were unintentional. Of the 25% that were intentional, over half were by
insiders. In other words, external threat actors were responsible for events only about 10% of
the time. Based on percentages alone, the hostile threat actor would appear to be of far less
concern than a mistake committed by a legitimate operator. However, the external threat
actor represents a potentially far more malicious and far-reaching impact on mission than
either the intentional insider or unintentional event. Among external threats, perhaps the most
insidious is the so-called Advanced Persistent Threat, or APT. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) (et al) assesses that the external threat actor found ways not
only to get “inside” but also to stay there as long as he wants or needs. The APT,10 especially
nation-state sponsored, is perhaps the most ominous threat to DOD networks. Open source
information on threats is plentiful and readily available, but ICS security teams will need access
to classified intelligence resources to obtain more “actionable” information.
“The increasing interconnectivity and interdependence among commercial and defense infrastructures
demand that DOD take steps to understand and remedy or mitigate the vulnerabilities of, and threats to,
the critical infrastructures on which it depends for mission accomplishment.”
Joint Pub 3-27 (p. VII-8)

MISSION PRIORITIES
Key Points:
• Missions are interconnected and mutually dependent in complex ways.
• Priorities tend to be situational and event-driven.
The US Navy, articulating what is essentially true for all the Services and including ICS as part of
their cyber infrastructure, has stated:11
“The Department of the Navy (DON) relies on a network of physical and
cyber infrastructure so critical that its degradation, exploitation, or
destruction could have a debilitating effect on the DON’s ability to project,
support, and sustain its forces and operations worldwide. This critical
infrastructure includes DON and non-DON domestic and foreign
10

NIST addressed the APT in Revision 4 to SP 800-53.
Critical Infrastructure Protection Program, Strategy for 2009 and Beyond, 2009

11

infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and
sustaining U.S. military operations on a global basis. Mission Assurance is a
process to ensure that assigned tasks or duties can be performed in
accordance with the intended purpose or plan. It is made more difficult
due to increased interconnectivity and interdependency of systems and
networks. DON critical infrastructures, both physical and cyber, even if
degraded, must be available to meet the requirements of multiple,
dynamic, and divergent missions.”
“Major ship systems may be impacted by SCADA network attacks ashore and
afloat. This may impact a ship’s ability to start or stop engines remotely
disabling portions of the propulsion system and other engineering systems.”
Navy TACMEMO NWDC 3-56.1-12

Which ICS receive greater focus for security efforts will depend in most cases on what missions
they support. The 262d Network Warfare Squadron (262 NWS) defines this as the “criticality”
of the system component whereby lesser systems may receive little to no focus while very
critical and centralized systems are recommended to be hardened and protected significantly.
An example might be where it is impossible to protect every component on a network; focus
would be on critical servers, in essence accepting the risk of an individual personal computer
compromise so long as it can be isolated and secure operation of the critical server maintained.
But even on a given installation mission priorities—and the importance of the supporting
control systems—can change quickly and without advance notice. Consider the following
hypothetical scenario highlighting such a rapid change.
Daedalus Air Force Base’s primary mission is undergraduate pilot training.
Flight operations are essential to this training. Flight operations depend
on, among other things, a well-managed fuels system and properly
functioning airfield lighting—both systems controlled by ICS. Therefore
securing the lighting and fuels ICS networks will be a priority over, for
example, automobile traffic control systems elsewhere on the installation.
At 1430 on Thursday, a terrorist incident results in declaration of Force
Protection Condition (FPCON) DELTA. At 1431 the primary mission of the
installation dramatically shifts from UPT to defense (of people,
infrastructure, and physical assets). ICS that are essential now include
vehicular traffic control (not so critical under FPCON ALPHA) and
emergency services (including camera systems, alarms, door controls, EMS
12

and fire department dispatch, etc.). As a result of the incident, one of the
ICS was damaged. The ICS maintainer is a commercial contractor whose
facilities are not on the base. The contractor has backups of the ICS
operating system, programs and data, but all are at the contractor facility
off base. Because of the elevated FPCON, the contractor cannot enter the
base. CE can provide some limited manual operation of the system, but is
neither capable nor prepared to operate at even 50% efficiency and
effectiveness.
Is the installation prepared for departures from the norm where ICS are part of the equation?
Do the various existing installation plans (incident response, disaster recovery, installation
emergency management, etc.) encompass ICS contingencies and emergencies? If so, have such
contingencies been exercised (not simply “white-carded” during an exercise)? These are some
of the considerations that will prove foundational to identifying ICS security priorities relative to
missions and changing mission priorities.

MISSION IMPACT
Key Point:
• If an element of the ICS and/or controlled infrastructure is compromised, critical mission
functions may be degraded or even entirely failed.
For any installation commander, mission assurance is of utmost concern. Anything that may
impact the mission rises to the top of the priority list. ICS and the controlled critical
infrastructure are deemed to be mission enablers; damage to or compromise of ICS can
degrade, compromise, or even deny the mission. With mission assurance foremost in mind,
this handbook provides the installation commander with a generalized approach to eliminate,
minimize, or otherwise mitigate risks to the mission as posed by ICS vulnerabilities.
It is important to note that this handbook does not attempt to achieve a level of specificity that
addresses vulnerabilities of specific products from specific vendors in specific applications. Nor
does it capture the range of threat actors who may be seeking to exploit those vulnerabilities.
Such level of specificity must be addressed on a case-by-case basis under the collaborative
efforts of the installation commander, CEs or PWs, communications element, and mission
operations representatives, and, in some cases, external experts. Specifically for the threat
piece of the equation, intelligence and/or law enforcement entities also must be consulted.
It is vitally important to understand that some mission-impacting vulnerabilities can be created
at nodes where it may not be intuitively obvious. For example, consider a fuels control system
directly supporting an operational mission. If this mission is assessed as high-priority, then the
fuels control system (i.e., ICS) merits a commensurately high priority for defensive measures
and may in fact be well defended. However there may be interconnections from non-missionrelated systems linked back into those that are critical, opening paths of access to even
defended nodes. For instance, there may be an unclassified IT network connection to the
vehicle traffic control system, which in turn has a connection to the EMS management system,
which in turn has a connection into the fuels management system. To discover which control
systems may present vulnerabilities to the mission requires following the trail (virtually,
logically, and physically) of all nodes and elements and their potential connections12 as well as
actual ones.
The probability of a threat actor finding and traversing all such interconnections to create
negative effects on the mission may not be high at a given moment, but threat actors

“Connection” includes wired network, wireless, radio, modem, USB port, Ethernet port….anything that enables
one element to connect to another.

continuously develop more advanced skills.13 Though current probability of a successful attack
may not be high, the advanced skill sets available to malicious actors combined with more
freely available advanced exploitation tools, many of which are created with ICS attack
components or even specifically for ICS, make this a serious threat. No system or sub-system
can be overlooked or assumed secure simply because it appears isolated. It is important to also
note that a vulnerability and risk assessment should consider not just primary effects on a
system, but potential second—and even third—order effects. Succinctly stated, an ICS
vulnerability and risk assessment should be supported by a thorough mission effects
assessment.
Prioritization of defense measures and resource allocation requires more than a one-to-one
matching with missions, but rather needs to be approached comprehensively. There is added
complexity created by Joint Base administration

the Army is lead agent for the Joint Base, do they consider the fuels system as the top priority
ICS to protect? How will this be decided where three or all Services are included in a Joint Base
structure? Such questions underscore the imperative for a comprehensive approach.

For example, the ICS-CERT in Alert 12-046-01, February 2012, stated: “ICS-CERT is monitoring and responding to
an increase in a combination of threat elements that increase the risk of control system attacks. These elements
include Internet accessible configurations, vulnerability and exploit tool releases for ICS devices, and increased
interest and activity by hacktivist groups and others.”

16

An absolutely 100% vulnerability-free, risk-free ICS does not exist and likely will not. To be
nearly invulnerable,14 an ICS must not be connected to anything other than its own
infrastructure elements. There also must be no potential method for external connections:
USB ports, Ethernet ports, wireless access points, satellite radio, modems, etc. Additionally,
there would have to be unassailable physical controls. However, vendors often need real-time
access to the infrastructure, and operators cannot be in all places all the time, which typically is
mitigated by remote access capability. Also, the ICS manufacturing industry favors connectivity
especially for vendor maintenance. Further complicating the security task is DOD’s “green”
mandate to convert the electric infrastructure to the “Smart Grid,” which depends on wireless
connectivity.15
The following “Top ICS Security Misconceptions” were presented in “318 OSS/IN SCADA Threat
Assessment Report”.16 Note that this list reflects ideas at a point in time and then only the top
five are presented; there are other relevant misconceptions, and all will most certainly change
over time. The point is simply that there is widespread misunderstanding about ICS security
and that such misunderstanding can result in a less-than-secure system. For brevity, the
“misconceptions” have been edited but retain the essential message of each as presented in
the original report:
• Misconception 1: ICS & SCADA Systems Have a Secure Software Profile.
Discussion: Systems that manage the delivery of critical resources should be viewed as one of
the nation’s top security priorities. ICS has not yet achieved the same level of security concern
as other cyber or IT resources. ICS typically are installed with availability as the primary driver
and then operating efficiency and cost-effectiveness as secondary imperatives; robust security
typically is an after-thought and sometimes not considered at all.
• Misconception 2: ICS & SCADA Systems are Monitored by IT Professionals.
Discussion: To those not directly involved it may seem that ICS falls under purview of the IT
experts, but that typically is not the case. Most often CEs or PWs are responsible for not only
the hardware elements of the infrastructure, but also the software and communications

14

Complete invulnerability is unachievable especially where the human element is necessary—thus the insider
threat is always a potential.
15
For example, “demand-response” management by the EMCS connecting to any load (fuels, lighting, HVAC,
whatever, wherever, whenever) depends on dedicated Internet connectivity. Military installations are
implementing smart grid technology as microgrids. On the other hand and more optimistically there are a number
of initiatives to enhance security for new (not legacy, though) systems such as the Advanced Metering
Infrastructure (AMI).

(network) components. While many engineers receive IT training it is often not as extensive as
for an IT professional, and typically centers on operational rather than security aspects.
• Misconception 3: All ICS Systems are Air-Gapped and Therefore Secure.
Discussion: Not only is this not true (and actually never was even when most systems were
isolated), but more and more systems that were air-gapped are being connected. Even airgapped17 systems are vulnerable, as demonstrated acutely by Stuxnet. Typically air-gapped
systems still have connectable access points, such as the USB drive in the Stuxnet case.
Additionally, when upgrades are made they may be by a CD that has not been properly scanned
for viruses or by a vendor plugging an unscanned laptop into an Ethernet port. Not only is “air
gapped” not necessarily secure, but dangerously can create a false sense of security (lends to
the “security by obscurity” fallacy). Yet another facet of this is that the “isolated” system often
is overlooked or even intentionally ignored during security audits that focus on the IT or
network elements.
• Misconception 4: ICS & SCADA Systems are Physically Secure.
Discussion: Perhaps most of those directly under control of DOD are physically secure (though
that has been shown to be false numerous times), but those not under DOD control are less
likely to be secure, at least to DOD standards. The Government Accountability Office (GAO)
estimates that 85% of energy infrastructure is “outside the fence” and that 99% of DOD’s
energy needs are met by commercial providers. Physical security (or lack thereof) does not end
at the fence. In other words, no matter how physically secure the installation may be there are
still external risks to be addressed. DOD dependence on commercial owners and providers
demands a teaming approach to physical security.
• Misconception 5: Proprietary Protocols Offer Security Through Obscurity.
Discussion: “Proprietary” serves as an impediment only to those operating legally and ethically,
and to a certain extent unsophisticated bad actors (only because they had not yet acquired the
skills). To the experienced hacker and state-sponsored actor, protocols are discoverable and
exploitable. There even have been web-published revelations of proprietary protocols by socalled independent researchers.
Misconceptions abound; therefore security may never be assumed or taken for granted. Any
given installation’s “most secure” ICS is fundamentally a function of continuous risk assessment
and management relative to given missions and situationally-dependent mission priorities.

17

“Air Gap” refers to having no electronic connection, requiring data to be moved “by hand” from one system to
another via media such as USB drives, CDs, etc.

18

Continuous awareness is key to recognizing vulnerabilities early and committing necessary
resources to manage potential risks. Proactivity is fundamental.

RISK ASSESSMENT & MANAGEMENT
Key Point:
• Risk management is a continuous process.
Risk is a function of the interaction among threat,18 vulnerability, and consequence (or mission
impact). Risk management involves a process of understanding each element of the equation,
how those elements interact, and how to respond to the assessed risk. Every installation will
face an ever-changing threat-vulnerability-consequence equation. SMEs within DOD,
Department of Energy (DOE), and industry agree that even the most secure network has, or will
have, inherent vulnerabilities. Therefore risk management is essential and must be a
continuous process rather than an event that takes place annually, quarterly, or even monthly.
Risk management is not only continuous but is situational based on the relative uniqueness of
each ICS infrastructure. Appendix F provides examples of risk assessment models.

FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSFUL ICS DEFENSE
Key Point:
• ICS defense is a team effort.
While there is no DOD, Joint, or Service policy or directive specific to creating a security
program for installation ICS, numerous publications do provide some guidance and address
elements of ICS security. The following “best practice” framework is derived from such
guidance.
1. Appoint a full-time ICS Information Assurance Manager (IAM) specifically for installation
control systems (i.e., distinct from an IT IAM).19 As an on-going coordinator of a team
formed in the next step, the ICS IAM20 will be responsible specifically for ICS and should
function directly under the authority of the installation commander.
18

“Threat” is further deconstructed into capability + intent + opportunity.
Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 11-1, released Mar 2011 by [then] HQ AFCESA/CEO, requires USAF CEs at base
level to appoint both primary and alternate IAMs with a focus on certification & accreditation (C&A) of all CEmanaged ICS. Note that AFCESA became AFCEC, of AF Civil Engineer Center, in October 2012.
20
The ICS IAM should be officially designated, trained for the position, and delegated authority to immediately
address issues within a defined sphere of responsibility. The ICS IAM should not be an additional-duty position.
19

19

2. Form an ICS security team led by the ICS IAM. Securing installation ICS networks cannot
be fully accomplished by any single individual or necessarily by any single base entity
(such as CEs or PWs typically considered “owners” of the infrastructure). Securing the
ICS and reducing risk to mission must be a team effort. This team of authoritative
experts should represent at least the CEs/PWs, the cyber unit, physical security, OPSEC,
and missions operations. Engineers can inform the “what” and “where”; the cyber or
communications experts can provide the “how”; and the mission representatives can
explain the “why” as well as the consequences of failure. Intelligence producers can
help understand the “who” that represents the threat. The installation commander sets
priorities in the form of “when” and makes the critical decisions on commitment and
allocation of resources and assets. Include other stakeholders as appropriate to the
installation and mission set, such as when there are tenant organizations (e.g., hospital)
whose missions may be distinct, but still rely on the installation ICS infrastructure.21
Consider creating also as a sub-element of this team an ICS-Computer Emergency
Response Team (CERT),22 modeled on that led by Department of Homeland Security
(DHS).23 If a network CERT already resides on the installation, coordinate to include ICS.
3. Direct the ICS security team in identifying existing and/or developing new policies with
respect to key elements of the ICS security program.
4. Promulgate policies and concurrently hold training sessions on the policies for all ICS
users, operators, and maintainers (analogous: IA training for anyone who touches a
network).
5. Implement policies and hold individuals accountable for adherence.
6. Assess effectiveness of measures undertaken (i.e., conduct risk analysis, exercise, red
team, or/and tabletop review).
7. Monitor and adjust as needed.

Last resort: An IT IAM could have ICS added to their “job jar” but should receive additional training specific to ICS.
Reference also ETL 11-1.
21
(USAF) SAF/CIO A6, in a Memo dated 20 March 2012 (mandatory compliance) instructed installations to create a
multi-disciplined Integrated Product Team (IPT) comprised of all stakeholders to assess IA of PIT, which includes
control systems.

ICS SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Key Point:
• Must begin with missions analysis and prioritization.
The following eight-step process is the heart of this handbook. All other included information
is in support of preparing for and understanding the criticality of the assessment process. Best
practice is to follow the steps as presented, but individual circumstances may warrant reversing
some steps and or accomplishing some in parallel. However approached, Step 1 must always
be accomplished first.
While virtually every major entity engaged in ICS defense recommends some version of a “best”
process for risk assessment and management, no two approaches are exactly the same. For
example OPNAVINST 3500.39C on Operational Risk Management presents a 5-step process.24
The approach presented here was developed by ICS SMEs working on the National SCADA Test
Bed at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and fits well with a DOD military installation focus.
In association with Step 7 of the process there is also a companion checklist of specific actions
to consider. That checklist is found at Attachment 2 and is introduced by a textual section titled
“Recommended Defense Actions.”
Step 1. Mission analysis. For ICS defense, the task is to establish a baseline understanding
among the stakeholders of the missions relative to the support infrastructure (both IT and
ICS). A key product of this first step is a prioritization of missions that can be linked to
assets and then ICS dependencies. Key question: If I have to devote all of my very limited
resources to protecting one mission, what would that be? Then the one after that?
Applying Mission Assurance Category (MAC) levels25 can be useful to this endeavor. Also
included may be a review of Mission Essential Tasks (MET)26 with reference to the Defense
Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). Mission analysis and decomposition, especially to a
granularity useful to the rest of the steps, likely will not be a trivial process and may require
significant commitment of the resource of time. A solid investment of time at this step will
make the follow-on steps easier to accomplish.

Step 2. Identify assets. This includes not only direct mission assets (such as aircraft, tanks,
ships, etc.) but more pointedly the infrastructure systems (such as fuels management and
delivery) that support those. The key is to identify the thread from mission to asset to
supporting infrastructure to ICS dependencies. This thread will reveal which ICS systems
are more critical when it comes to applying security controls.
“As a network defender, it is critical to know how the network is laid out as well as
the hardware associated with the network. In order to defend SCADA, the
operator needs to know what he or she has to work with.“
AFTTP 3-1.CWO (para. 7.6.3.2)

Step 3. Determine ICS connectivity. It is absolutely essential to identify every point of
connectivity because the greatest vulnerability is at any point of connection. While
NIPRNet connectivity may take top tier on the list, any connectivity—whether currently
connected or could be connected later—must be identified. To leave even one potential
connection undiscovered possibly is to leave the entire network27 vulnerable. Running a
scan on the network elements will identify only what is connected and on at the moment
of the scan. This is a key reason for conducting a physical inventory as well, setting eyes on
any and every potential connection capability. A PLC may be inside a locked cabinet inside
a fenced compound with armed guards at a gate, but if it has an Ethernet port it is
connectible (e.g., for vendor maintenance) and therefore, is a potential risk.
Step 4. Determine ICS dependencies. Which missions and their supporting infrastructure
are dependent on a properly functioning control system? Are multiple control systems
involved (as in the earlier example of traffic control, emergency systems, fuels delivery)?
This step also requires technical network mapping typically coupled with a physical
inventory and an operational-level understanding of the missions. See Attachment 1,
Mapping Interdependencies, for an example methodology. A comprehensive approach to
this must be followed with collaboration among representatives from at least the cyber,
engineering, and mission operations communities.
Step 5. Assess risk. Risk is characterized as an outcome of the interaction among threat,
vulnerability, and consequence. The goal is to gain a clear understanding of actual risks
that can be managed. All stakeholders need to be engaged in every step of this entire
process, but here is where collaboration becomes absolutely essential. Intelligence
27

Arguably extreme, but since we do not know what we do not know (in this example) one is left contemplating
“worst case.”

23

analysts help identify external threats; engineer, PWs, and comm/IT specialists provide
understanding of the control infrastructure and its vulnerabilities; and operations
personnel can define the mission consequences or impacts of a realized threat event.
Numerous risk analysis publications and external organizations are available to assist with
this step.
Step 6. Prioritize risk management actions. Risk management typically entails deciding
among a finite list of response options: avoid, share/transfer, mitigate, or accept. A
response option or course of action (COA) typically is selected based on what is feasible,
practical, and affordable (i.e., a cost-benefit analysis relative to mission impact). In most
cases the commander, decides on a COA and then prioritizes commitment of resources to
accomplish the actions.
Step 7. Implement actions. This step requires systematic implementation however
simple or complex. At the minimum, one must identify the typical who is to do what,
where, and when, i.e., direction, responsibility, accountability, and resources available. The
sine qua non of implementation is commitment of resources combined with accountability
mechanisms.
Step 8. Monitor, and reenter the cycle as required. This is never a “fire and forget”
activity. Any (even trivial) change to an architecture can introduce new vulnerabilities
(emphasizing also the imperative to institute a configuration control process). Additionally,
threat actors are continuously on the hunt for vulnerabilities not yet discovered by
legitimate owners and operators. To maintain a steady state of security requires
continuous monitoring. Furthermore, implementation of any plan is likely to encounter
impediments. This will be the phase or step to identify those and readjust as necessary.
The success of this step depends on existence of feedback processes and mechanisms,
which should have been implemented already.

24

SOFTWARE TOOLS
Key Point:
• Tools can be good or bad.
• Even a “good” tool is only as good as the expert who uses it.
For many steps in the process of assessing and defending security of ICS, there exists a broad
selection of supporting primarily software tools. At the installation command level, it is
important simply to note that while such tools are available, tools alone will not guarantee a
successful defensive posture of ICS. The human element is essential in every step.
Perhaps the most important thing to understand about software tools used with or on any ICS
is that the tool must not affect the operation of the ICS or, more specifically, the infrastructure
it controls. The most important thing to do with respect to software tools is to defer to IT SMEs
who already have a set of approved tools and understand potential impacts of using those tools
on particular networks.
Because the services provided by critical infrastructure (electricity heading the list) must always
be available, the ICS likewise must be always available. Therefore, any software-based
assessment or forensics action upon or through the ICS must not impede, deny, or otherwise
alter the system, the data throughput, or the services supported.
Because of the necessity of maintaining availability, due diligence must be exercised if
considering use of traditional IT tools (scanners, penetration testers, etc.) on ICS networks.
Some IT tools introduce negative effects on the ICS as well as on the controlled infrastructure.
Examples are plentiful. The NIST SP 800-82 (p. 3-22) relates one such example:
“A natural gas utility hired an IT security consulting organization to conduct
penetration testing on its corporate IT network.
The consulting
organization carelessly ventured into a part of the network that was
directly connected to the SCADA system. The penetration test locked up
the SCADA system and the utility was not able to send gas through its
pipelines for four hours. The outcome was the loss of service to its
customer base for those four hours.”
While significant to those customers, this is trivial compared to impacts on national defense
missions. For example, consider potential consequences if the same action involved an ICS
supporting fuels management for a combat flying mission or life support systems at a hospital.

25

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
Key Point:
• Outside help is available—and much of it is at no cost to the requestor.
Due primarily to the ever-changing nature of the ICS security landscape, published guidance
tends to quickly become obsolete. Fortunately, beyond the array of formal publications there
exists a helpful offering of additional useful resources. For example:
• Numerous web sites provide detailed information on ICS security issues, current threats,
tools, etc. Some of the more prominent are provided as Appendix B, Web Links.
• Students at the Services’ advanced Professionally Military Education (PME) schools can
be exceptionally good sources for current insights as many engage in fresh research and
produce theses specific to emerging ICS/SCADA issues.
• Industry conferences can be exceptional sources of lessons learned and/or best
practices, as well as provide opportunity to network with experts.
• Finally, establishing a close relationship with local critical infrastructure owners (e.g., the
electric power company, water provider, etc.) can yield better understanding of local
threats and risks, and thus better security for the entire community.
For current threat assessment information, sources may include: Air Force Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI), the Army Criminal Investigative Division (CID), or other Service
equivalent; intelligence analysts (the J2/A2/G2 shop); and the ICS-CERT’s Alerts and Warnings.

ICS SECURITY ACTIONS
Key Point:
• Use this with Step 7 of the Process and with the tabular checklist provided as
Attachment 2.
The following section presents a series of action recommendations for securing ICS. Numerous
entities, to include DOD, DOE, Commerce Department, and commercial vendors have published
similar lists (see the “References” appendix for some of those). These recommendations are
augmented by the “stand-alone” tabular checklist found at Attachment 2, and most
appropriately considered at Step 7 of the “Security Assessment Process.”
The recommendations that follow are in an outline that follows the familiar doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel, facilities, and policy
26

DOTMLPF-P28 framework29 but with minor modification. The two modifications are that (1)
doctrine (D) is not directly addressed30 while (2) cyber security (C) has been added, resulting in
a COTMLPF-P framework that exists only in this publication. “Cyber security” is used here to
distinguish between those measures taken in, on and/or through the network(s) and those
actions of a more or less physical nature (such as using access control lists). Arguably the most
critical set of security measures, cyber security is addressed last because such measures are
most effective when supported by solid implementation of actions in the other areas and in
particular when guided by clear policy.

RECOMMENDED ICS DEFENSE ACTIONS
POLICY

“The development of the organization’s security policy is the first and most important step in
developing an organizational security program. Security policies lay the groundwork for
securing the organization’s physical, enterprise, and control system assets.” [Catalog of Control
Systems Security, DHS, Apr 2011, p. 4.] [emphasis added]
The National Security Agency (NSA), in its “Securing SCADA and Control Systems” brochure
(referring to Sandia National Lab’s Framework for SCADA Security Policy), states: “A Security
Policy defines the controls, behaviors, and expectations of users and processes, and lays the
groundwork for securing CS31 assets. Since the acceptable use of CS is narrower and may have
more demanding operational requirements than IT systems, they also demand their own
Security Policy.” [emphasis added]
The installation commander must establish authoritative and directive policies with regard to
all other aspects of the ICS, thus the rationale for starting with the Policy area.

28

DOTMLPF-P: doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel, facilities, and policy.
This is borrowed from Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01H, Joint Capabilities Integration and
Development System (JCIDS); and further acknowledges DoDM 3020.45 Vol 2, Defense Critical Information
Program (DCIP) Remediation Planning, which states that remediation planning “shall consider a full range of…
[DOTMLPF] options”.
29
Examples of other frameworks: People, processes & technology; strategic, operational & tactical; management,
operational & technical.
30
Any action undertaken in any other area may lead to consideration of doctrinal change. However, this handbook
facilitates practical application and so intentionally does not directly address doctrine. Ultimately, best practices
may result in recommended changes to doctrine, requiring entering the JCIDS process.
31
CS = NSA’s abbreviation for “control systems.”

27

Policy Actions
• Reuse policy where appropriate. Usually it is not necessary to start from scratch on every
policy. Many ICS security issues are also IT and/or IA issues. Many published IT and IA
policies may be adapted to ICS. Also, there is increasing promulgation of Service- and DODlevel policies specific to ICS (for example, Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency32
[AFCESA]’s ETL 11-1).
• Ensure policies are promulgated to the lowest user level, and require training programs to
address ICS policies.
• With the ICS security team (discussed previously), determine which elements of the ICS
require specific policies vs. those that may be combined into a single policy document.
Examples:
o An access control policy might include password management, physical facilities control,
and connectivity controls.
o A personnel security policy likely will warrant a dedicated policy document.
• Once complete, the set of policies should address at minimum:
o Access control
o Inventory accounting
o Security of physical assets
o Configuration control
o Acquisition of new hardware/software
o Patching of operating systems and programs
o Vendor / third-party roles and responsibilities
o Conduct of vulnerability and risk assessments

LEADERSHIP

Much is subsumed in “leadership.” With regard to ICS security it is important that leadership
remain engaged and that operators are confident there is a “top-down” emphasis on ICS
security. Promulgation of policy is a critical start, but ongoing leadership gives life to those
policies. Delegate requisite authority and demand accountability, but do not retreat from
oversight.
Leadership Actions
• Conduct periodic awareness briefings to ICS operators and users. Recommend including
quarterly reminders of potential threats.
32

In October 2012 AFCESA merged with AFCEE and AFRPA to become AFCEC, or Air Force Civil Engineer Center.
ETL 11-1 still validly exists as an AFCESA publication.

Participate in ICS security stakeholder events, such as DOD conferences, industry group
seminars, and on-line discussion forums.
Establish collaborative relationships with commercial service providers (electric, water, gas,
etc.), with focus on their security programs to secure the infrastructure beyond the
installation fence. Invite them to training sessions as adjunct members of the security
team.
Identify and mitigate the conditions whereby reliance on vendors creates potential single
points of failure. Vendors often are the ones most familiar with installation systems, do not
always have immediate access to those systems, and at times can be denied access (such as
during elevating FPCONs).
Add ICS information to the Commander’s Critical Information List.
Engage in the ICS acquisition process from planning through installation; include upgrades
to existing systems as well as new systems.
Develop plans where none exist or otherwise incorporate ICS into those that do. Examples:
o System Security Plan (SSP)
o Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
o Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
o Contingency Plans–ICS operation under various INFOCON, FPCON, and other
emergencies
o Operations Security self-assessments and surveys

PERSONNEL

The human element is necessary for the successful operation of ICS, and therefore is a critical
area. All individuals who operate, maintain, or otherwise access ICS must understand their
respective roles and responsibilities and be appropriately trained to those responsibilities. The
insider threat (legitimate operators with legitimate access but illegitimate intent) can overcome
most security controls. Even an “honest broker” can make a mistake that results in the same
(or worse) impact on mission that a true threat actor can cause.
Personnel Actions
• Ensure every individual is trained for their specific responsibilities and undergoes
mandatory periodic update/refresher training (similar to IA training).
• Enforce access controls and establish consequences for violations. For example, every
individual has a unique logon (best practice = role-based) and is allowed access only by that
logon (i.e., no “guest” accounts).

29

Require special background checks on individuals who have access to ICS elements that are
critical to mission accomplishment. Consider requiring Secret clearances at least for those
individuals with access to mission-critical elements and/or who have full system
administration privileges.
Request ICS managers and operators to sign confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements.
Treat ICS information at the very least as unclassified but sensitive.
Maintain rosters for physical access to facilities, such as rooms where servers are
maintained. Require sign-in/sign-out when accessed.
Create an ICS incident response team modeled on DHS’ ICS-CERT.
Ensure that personnel who resign, retire, or are fired do not have continued access to any
element of the ICS. Extend this vigilance to employees of contractors and vendors.
Ensure that relevant personnel (members of ICS security team, asset owners, etc.) either
monitor or routinely are made aware of new vulnerabilities and incidents published by ICSCERT and ICS component vendors.

TRAINING

Training includes formal, informal, and exercise. Many negative incidents involving ICS, the
controlled infrastructure, and/or the missions they support are attributed to legitimate
operators who made mistakes due to training deficiencies. A systematic program of mandatory
training should be implemented for all managers, operators, and other users of the installation
control systems.
Training Actions
• Ensure all operators (at minimum) have had ICS-specific training prior to granting access to
any element or component.
• Require IA and OPSEC training for every individual accessing ICS computer systems even if
those systems are not directly connected to the IT network. This training must also include
contractors and vendors who only sometimes connect to ICS computer systems.
• Provide threat and vulnerability awareness via appropriate forums, unit security awareness
training, workplace bulletin boards, etc.
• Exercise plans (incident response, disaster recovery, continuity of operations, etc). Include
with other installation exercises where practicable and include ICS-related scenarios under
elevating INFOCON and/or FPCON.
• Document all training and ensure each individual maintains currency.

30

ORGANIZATION

In many cases ICS tend to be “out-of-sight, out-of-mind” to all installation personnel but the CE
or PW personnel. As long as the lights are on, water is running, and gates function properly
there is no need to be concerned with the systems that make that true. The downside of this
view is that it creates a dampening effect on responsibility and accountability for the total ICS
infrastructure. While PW/CE accept “ownership” responsibility for the control system field
elements, anecdotal information is that the IT side often is viewed as entirely under purview of
the IT organization. Conversely, in some cases IT considers the entirety of the ICS network,
including the front-end IT elements, as CE’s responsibility.33 The ICS must be considered as a
mission-critical system of systems and treated as such organizationally, with collaboration
among CE, IT, and the operations’ stakeholders. Ill-defined division of labor (responsibility) can
create gaps that become threat vectors, or the trade-space of threat actors (both internal and
external).
Organization Actions
• Create a position for an ICS IAM with functional authority and direct access to the
installation commander. Ensure the IAM’s participation in key venues to provide
commander advocacy for ICS security and awareness.
• Clarify (and document on command relationship charts) roles and responsibilities of PW/CE,
communications, operations (and other stakeholders as appropriate) with respect to
operation, maintenance, and security of installation ICS.
• Fully document the ICS—hardware, software, firmware, connectivity, and physical locations
of all. Create a topology or ICS system map reflecting connections to supported missions
and a logic diagram depicting all information/data flows.
• Assign responsibility for ICS configuration management and control. May require creation
of a configuration control board (CCB). The key is this entity documents configuration and
maintains continuing control over changes.
• Identify the entity/individuals responsible for developing formal plans (continuity of
operations, disaster recovery, etc.).
• Establish roles and responsibilities with regard to third-party relationships.
• Ensure all ICS users and operators understand the chain of command particularly for
incident reporting and response mechanisms.
33

On a more positive note, the Air Force has made progress in resolving this issue. Implementation typically lags
policy and direction but four key publications have been promulgated beginning in early 2011: SAF/CIO A6 memo
of Feb 2011 appointing Designated Accrediting Authority for PIT (includes ICS); SAF/CIO A6 memo (Feb 2011)
delegating Certifying Authority to AFCESA/CEO; AFCESA’s ETL 11-1 (Mar 2011) which deals with ICS information
assurance; and SAF/CIO A6 guidance memo (AFGM2.2, Mar 2012) addressing IA of all PIT and announcing
commensurate changes to AFI 33-210.

31

FACILITIES

While some elements of the controlled infrastructure are of necessity exposed (for example the
wires of the electric power grid, pipelines for natural gas) most of the control system elements
are housed in facilities ranging from guarded buildings to remote access panels. Each type of
facility engenders its own relatively unique security challenges, but all share the dichotomous
requirement to ensure that legitimate users can gain quick access when necessary while at the
same time exclude everyone else from any access whatsoever.
Facilities Actions
• Physically identify and visually inspect every facility that houses any element of the ICS,
however seemingly insignificant. This includes fenced enclosures, buildings, rooms in
buildings, field huts, lockboxes, panels, etc. Often overlooked but must be included in
“facilities” are the physical connections (e.g., coaxial cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), fiber
optics, telephone lines). On large installations it is especially important to identify, inspect,
and secure any facility near the perimeter fence (where feasible, relocate away from
perimeter).
• Ensure that cabling terminations and their housings are not overlooked. Threats can come
from cutting, splicing, tapping, and/or intercepting.
• Develop a plan of action and milestones (POA&M) for addressing physical security
deficiencies. An extremely high level of physical security may be achieved by placing
cameras, alarms, and armed guards on every facility. However, this typically is neither
practical nor cost-efficient. Focus should be on those ICS that are critical to the missions,
and then emphasizing where the control system is most exposed to risk. Feasibility,
practicality, and expense all will temper selected COAs.
• Create a map of the facilities and the assets housed by each. Use in training, exercises, and
actual incident response.
• Ensure portable equipment (e.g., laptops) that may be in storage until required (for
backups, recovery, etc.) is included in the inventory and security measures.
• Consider an OPSEC survey focused on ICS. In any event, OPSEC measures should be applied
to appropriate elements.

MATERIEL

Consider how physical assets are acquired, maintained, and removed from service. Does policy
or other guidance exist? Historically control systems have had a life cycle measured in decades
as opposed to IT, which has a life cycle of three years or less. One outcome is that components
that have built-in vulnerabilities can remain in the network for years, often without those
32

vulnerabilities and their attendant risks being addressed. Replacement and maintenance of ICS
should be approached strategically (i.e., long-term) as well as tactically and operationally.
Materiel Actions
• Assign responsibility for oversight of the physical assets to a configuration control manager
or board.
• Establish a formal process for acquisition of new components.
• Operationally test (including vulnerability assessment) proposed new components off-line
before introducing into the live network. Collaborate with the National SCADA Test Bed
(NSTB) entities (INL, Sandia National Laboratory [SNL]) to test components in “live” and
simulated environments.
• Treat adjunct materials (software, tech manuals, SOPs, plans, schematics, etc.) with the
same level of security as the ICS.

33

CYBER SECURITY

Cyber security for ICS is in many respects the same as for IT. Most front-end elements (e.g.,
servers, operating systems, human-machine interfaces, connectivity) are in fact information
technology elements. On the other hand, since most non-IT components typically are on a 1520 year refresh (replacement) cycle and are tied to the operating system with which they
originally were installed, even the IT elements can “age-out” or become unsupported making
cyber security at the front end more challenging. Differences from IT become more distinct
“downstream” in the system, with RTUs, PLCs, and of course the field mechanisms (sensors,
gauges, etc.) interfaced directly with the controlled infrastructure. Cyber security applies to all
those elements because they are still part of the network. Nearly every component in the
system could provide a threat vector into the network. Of primary concern is connectivity
from/into NIPRNet and/or any segment of the GIG, but any connection into the system must be
considered as creating a risk to the DOD missions of the installation.
“Asset owners should not assume that their control systems are secure or that
they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration. Instead, asset
owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices, weak
authentication methods, and component vulnerabilities.”
ICS CERT-ALERT-12-046-01 (Feb 2012)

This section reflects more actions, and more of them technology-based, than the other
(D)OTMLPF-P areas. However, in spite of the expansion of information this listing should not be
viewed as absolutely complete, finite, or prescriptive. Existing policies and procedures already
in place and proven effective should not be replaced based solely on this listing. Consult other
publications (see References), engage the IT and IA professionals, seek assistance/advice from
other government-related ICS experts, and consider contracting for assessment services from
commercial providers.
Cyber Security Actions
• Define and defend perimeters. “Defense in depth” is an operative phrase often
encountered. Strategic approaches include creating enclaves, segmentation, and
establishing demilitarized zones (DMZ), typically using firewalls. NSA, DHS, and others
recommend total isolation of ICS networks but that is not always possible or practical.
Where some connectivity is required, at least secure the points where connection can be
made.
• Control web access. Where Internet or NIPRNet connectivity is required limit access to the
web by turning off unnecessary web services and ports, and consider using “white” and/or
34

•

•

•

•

•

“black” lists of allowed/not allowed sites. (Note: Whitelisting is often preferred over
blacklisting.)
Protect data. Encrypt mission-critical data in transmission and provide backups or other
redundancies for data in stasis (files, databases, etc.). As a caveat, downstream data such
as between a PLC and a field device cannot be encrypted.
Protect the operating system. Perimeter defense is a good start, but threat actors (insiders,
for example) can find ways inside the perimeter. Use defensive tools34 (software) such as
for intrusion detection. Implement and update virus-checking software (may need to do
manually if not connected). Establish a patching protocol (typically requires testing off-line
first). Enable audit logging, and review the logs frequently to detect anomalous (especially
illegitimate) activity. Also, remove all services, programs, etc. not needed for operation of
the ICS.
Manage installation of new assets. Ensure hardware and software factory default or
contractor-enabled settings are changed. Do not allow anything that is
connected/connectable, new or legacy, to be accessed using default passwords. Vendors
prefer to maintain defaults especially on field devices (e.g., PLCs) for ease of maintenance
access. Those same defaults typically are publically accessible, often published on vendor
company web sites, and will be used by threat actors.
Disable every connection point not needed. Points include USB ports, wireless access
points, Ethernet jacks, satellite receivers, modems, etc. Provide positive control over all
remaining points, ensuring no “backdoor” exists. Even one unguarded USB port can provide
a devastating threat vector. This point is demonstrated by the publically reported outcome
of the Stuxnet infection of an Iranian nuclear processing facility’s centrifuge control system.
Control individual access to all elements. The operating system server and workstations are
obvious control points but some field elements such as PLCs can (and do) have separate
logons. There are a number of operational and tactical actions to take, selectively or
collectively. Foremost is to require each individual to have a unique (unshared) logon ID
and password.35 Policy should strictly prohibit shared passwords. Institute least-privilege
and role-based access. Absolutely nothing should be accessible via “guest” or anonymous
accounts, in spite of very plausible rationale for such given by vendors. Administrator
privileges should be given to vendors only as required and then closely monitored.

34

Discussed elsewhere, but a reminder is warranted: Be cautious with software tools. Some very effective tools
for IT networks can cause problems on ICS. Typically, passivity is the key characteristic. Tools that interact with
the system, such as for intrusion protection mostly, are to be avoided. If an interactive tools is determined to be
necessary it must first be tested off-line before use on ICS. Even if it “passes” the test, tools should be closely
monitored for unanticipated, undiscovered negative effects.
35
Air Force is implementing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as widely as possible. Also, DoD-wide many logons are
accomplished with a Common Access Card (CAC). Aside from the method of network access, the key takeaway is
unique, linked to a vetted user, not shareable with anyone else.

APPENDIX D

GLOSSARY

Advanced Persistent Threat. An adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and
significant resources, which allow it to create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using
multiple attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and deception). These objectives typically include
establishing and extending footholds within the information technology infrastructure of the
targeted organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information, undermining or impeding
critical aspects of a mission, program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out these
objectives in the future. The advanced persistent threat: (i) pursues its objectives repeatedly
over an extended period of time; (ii) adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it; and (iii) is
determined to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives. [NIST SP 80053 Rev 4]
• Advanced: The actor is adaptive and able to evade detection and is able to gain and
maintain access to protected networks and resident sensitive information.
• Persistent: The actor has a strong foothold in/on the target network and is
exceptionally difficult to completely remove or deny even if detected.
• Threat: The actor has both capability and intent that is counter to the best interests of
the network and/or the legitimate users.
Asset. A distinguishable entity that provides a service or capability. Assets are people, physical
entities, or information located either within or outside the United States and employed,
owned, or operated by domestic, foreign, public, or private sector organizations. [DODD
3020.40]
Configuration Control. Process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware, software,
and documentation to protect the information system against improper modifications before,
during, and after system implementation. [NIST SP 800-53]
Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI). DCI is the DOD and non-DOD networked assets essential
to project, support, and sustain military forces and operations worldwide. Assets are people,
physical entities, or information. Physical assets would include installations, facilities, ports,
bridges, power stations, telecommunication lines, pipelines, etc. The increasing
interconnectivity and interdependence among commercial and defense infrastructures demand
that DOD take steps to understand and remedy or mitigate the vulnerabilities of, and threats
to, the critical infrastructures on which it depends for mission accomplishment. The DCIP is a
fully integrated program that provides a comprehensive process for understanding and
protecting selected infrastructure assets that are critical to national security during peace,
crisis, and war. It involves identifying, prioritizing, assessing, protecting, monitoring, and
48

assuring the reliability and availability of mission-critical infrastructures essential to the
execution of the NMS. The program also addresses the operational decision support necessary
for CCDRs to achieve their mission objectives despite the degradation or absence of these
infrastructures. [Joint Publication 3-27] [see also: DODD 3020.40, DODI 3020.45, and DODM
2020.45 vols 1-5]
Defense-in-Depth. Information security strategy integrating people, technology, and
operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the
organization. [NIST SP 800-39]
Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). A written plan for processing critical applications in the event of
a major hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities. [NIST SP 800-82]
DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). The DOD
process for identifying, implementing, validating, certifying, and managing IA capabilities and
services, expressed as IA controls, and authorizing the operation of DOD ISs, including testing in
a live environment, in accordance with statutory, Federal, and DOD requirements. [DODI
8510.01]
Enclave. Collection of computing environments connected by one or more internal networks
under the control of a single authority and security policy, including personnel and physical
security. Enclaves always assume the highest mission assurance category and security
classification of the AIS applications or outsourced IT-based processes they support, and derive
their security needs from those systems. They provide standard IA capabilities such as
boundary defense, incident detection and response, and key management, and also deliver
common applications such as office automation and electronic mail…Enclaves may be specific
to an organization or a mission, and the computing environments may be organized by physical
proximity or by function independent of location. Examples of enclaves include local area
networks and the applications they host, backbone networks, and data processing centers.
[DODD 8500.01E]
Force Protection Condition (FPCON). A Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff-approved standard
for identification of and recommended responses to terrorist threats against US personnel and
facilities. [Joint Pub 1-02]
Incident. An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or
transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies,
49

security procedures, or acceptable use policies. Incidents may be intentional or unintentional.
[NIST SP 800-82]
Information Assurance (IA). Measures that protect and defend information and information
systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating
protection, detection, and reaction capabilities. [DODD 8500.01E]
Information Assurance Manager (IAM). The individual responsible for the information
assurance program of a DOD information system or organization. While the term IAM is
favored within the Department of Defense, it may be used interchangeably with the IA title
Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM). [DODI 8500.2]
Information Operations Condition (INFOCON). The INFOCON system provides a framework
within which the Commander USSTRATCOM (CDRUSSTRATCOM), regional commanders, service
chiefs, base/post/camp/station/vessel commanders, or agency directors can increase the
measurable readiness of their networks to match operational priorities. [CJCSI 6510.01F]
Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A security service that monitors and analyzes network or
system events for the purpose of finding, and providing real-time or near real-time warning of,
attempts to access system resources in an unauthorized manner. [NIST SP 800-82]
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). A system that can detect an intrusive activity and can also
attempt to stop the activity, ideally before it reaches its targets. [NIST SP 800-82]
Mission Assurance. A process to ensure that assigned tasks or duties can be performed in
accordance with the intended purpose or plan. It is a summation of the activities and measures
taken to ensure that required capabilities and all supporting infrastructures are available to the
Department of Defense to carry out the National Military Strategy. It links numerous risk
management program activities and security-related functions, such as force protection;
antiterrorism; critical infrastructure protection; IA; continuity of operations; chemical,
biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive defense; readiness; and installation
preparedness to create the synergy required for the Department of Defense to mobilize,
deploy, support, and sustain military operations throughout the continuum of operations.
[DODD 3020.40]
Mission Assurance Category (MAC). Applicable to DOD information systems, the mission
assurance category reflects the importance of information relative to the achievement of DOD
50

goals and objectives, particularly the warfighters' combat mission. Mission assurance
categories are primarily used to determine the requirements for availability and integrity. The
Department of Defense has three defined mission assurance categories: [DODD 8500.01E]
• MAC I. Systems handling information that is determined to be vital to the operational
readiness or mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both
content and timeliness. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability of a MAC I
system are unacceptable and could include the immediate and sustained loss of mission
effectiveness. MAC I systems require the most stringent protection measures.
• MAC II. Systems handling information that is important to the support of deployed and
contingency forces. The consequences of loss of integrity are unacceptable. Loss of
availability is difficult to deal with and can only be tolerated for a short time. The
consequences could include delay or degradation in providing important support
services or commodities that may seriously impact mission effectiveness or operational
readiness. MAC II systems require additional safeguards beyond best practices to
ensure adequate assurance.
• MAC III. Systems handling information that is necessary for the conduct of day-to-day
business, but does not materially affect support to deployed or contingency forces in
the short-term. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability can be tolerated or
overcome without significant impacts on mission effectiveness or operational readiness.
The consequences could include the delay or degradation of services or commodities
enabling routine activities. MAC III systems require protective measures, techniques, or
procedures generally commensurate with commercial best practices.
Mission Essential Functions (MEF). The specified or implied tasks required to be performed by,
or derived from, statute, Executive Order, or other appropriate guidance, and those
organizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DOD
component missions or responsibilities in a continuity threat or event. Failure to perform or
sustain these functions would significantly affect the Department of Defense’s ability to provide
vital services or exercise authority, direction, and control. [DODD 3020.26]
National Security System. Any information system (including any telecommunications system)
used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf
of an agency—(i) the function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities;
involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves command and control of
military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is
to be used for routine administrative and business applications, for example, payroll, finance,
logistics, and personnel management applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by
51

procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under criteria
established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of
national defense or foreign policy. [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]
Platform Information Technology (PIT) and PIT-Interconnection (PITI). For DOD IA purposes,
platform IT interconnection refers to network access to platform IT. Platform IT
interconnection has readily identifiable security considerations and needs that must be
addressed in both acquisition, and operations. Platform IT refers to computer resources, both
hardware and software, that are physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in real time to the
mission performance of special purpose systems such as weapons, training simulators,
diagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration equipment, equipment used in the
research and development of weapons systems, medical technologies, transport vehicles,
buildings, and utility distribution systems such as water and electric. Examples of platform IT
interconnections that impose security considerations include communications interfaces for
data exchanges with enclaves for mission planning or execution, remote administration, and
remote upgrade or reconfiguration. [emphasis added] [DODD 8500.01E, DODI 8500.2]
Risk.
•
•

•

Potential for an unwanted outcome resulting from an incident, event, or occurrence, as
determined by its likelihood and the associated consequences. [DHS Risk Lexicon]
A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or
event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the
circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. [CNSSI 4009]
An expression of consequences in terms of the probability of an event occurring, the
severity of the event and the exposure of personnel or resources to potential loss or
harm. A general expression of risk as a function of probability [P], severity [S], and
exposure [E] can be written as: Risk = ƒ(P, S, E). [AFPAM 90-902]

Risk Assessment. The process of identifying risks to organizational operations (including
mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, resulting from the operation of an information system. Part of risk
management, incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and considers mitigations
provided by security controls planned or in place. Synonymous with risk analysis. [NIST SP 80053]
Risk Management. The program and supporting processes to manage information security risk
to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational
52

assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, and includes: (i) establishing the
context for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) responding to risk once determined; and
(iv) monitoring risk over time. [NIST SP 800-53]
Risk Management Strategies. [DHS Risk Lexicon]
• Acceptance: explicit or implicit decision not to take an action that would affect all or
part of a particular risk.
• Avoidance: strategies or measures taken that effectively remove exposure to a risk.
• Mitigation: application of measure or measures to reduce the likelihood of an
unwanted occurrence and/or its consequences.
• Transfer: action taken to manage risk that shifts some or all of the risk to another
entity, asset, system, network, or geographic area.
Risk Mitigation. Prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing
controls/countermeasures recommended from the risk management process. [NIST SP 800-53]
Security Audit. Independent review and examination of a system’s records and activities to
determine the adequacy of system controls, ensure compliance with established security policy
and procedures, detect breaches in security services, and recommend any changes that are
indicated for countermeasures. [NIST SP 800-82]
Security Policy. Security policies define the objectives and constraints for the security program.
Policies are created at several levels, ranging from organization or corporate policy to specific
operational constraints (e.g., remote access). In general, policies provide answers to the
questions “what” and “why” without dealing with “how.” Policies are normally stated in terms
that are technology-independent. [NIST SP 800-82]
System Security Plan (SSP). Formal document that provides an overview of the security
requirements for an information system and describes the security controls in place or planned
for meeting those requirements. [NIST SP 800-18]
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). A generic name for a computerized system
that is capable of gathering and processing data and applying operational controls over long
distances. Typical uses include power transmission and distribution and pipeline systems.
SCADA was designed for the unique communication challenges (e.g., delays, data integrity)
posed by the various media that must be used, such as phone lines, microwave, and satellite.
Usually shared rather than dedicated. [NIST SP 800-82]

53

Task Critical Asset. An asset that is of such extraordinary importance that its incapacitation or
destruction would have a serious, debilitating effect on the ability of one or more DOD
Components or DISLA organizations to execute the task or mission-essential task it supports.
Task critical assets are used to identify defense critical assets. [DODD 3020.40]
Virtual Private Network (VPN). A restricted-use, logical (i.e., artificial or simulated) computer
network that is constructed from the system resources of a relatively public, physical (i.e., real)
network (such as the Internet), often by using encryption (located at hosts or gateways), and
often by tunneling links of the virtual network across the real network. [NIST SP 800-82]
Vulnerability Assessment. Systematic examination of an information system or product to
determine the adequacy of security measures, identify security deficiencies, provide data from
which to predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures, and confirm the adequacy of
such measures after implementation. [NIST SP 800-39]

APPENDIX G CSET
CYBER SECURITY EVALUATION TOOL (CSET)
[Following extracted from the ICS-CERT web site. http://www.uscert.gov/control_systems/satool.html ]
The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET™) is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
product that assists organizations in protecting their key national cyber assets. It was
developed under the direction of the DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) by
cybersecurity experts and with assistance from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. This tool provides users with a systematic and repeatable approach for assessing
the security posture of their cyber systems and networks. It includes both high-level and
detailed questions related to all industrial control and IT systems. CSET is a desktop software
tool that guides users through a step-by-step process to assess their control system and
information technology network security practices against recognized industry standards. The
output from CSET is a prioritized list of recommendations for improving the cybersecurity
posture of the organization's enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. The tool derives
the recommendations from a database of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices.
Each recommendation is linked to a set of actions that can be applied to enhance cybersecurity
controls.
A caveat provided by the ICS-CERT: CSET is only one component of the overall cyber security
picture and should be complemented with a robust cyber security program within the
organization. A self-assessment with CSET cannot reveal all types of security weaknesses, and
should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture. The tool will
not provide an architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network hardware/software
configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk
assessment. CSET is not intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system
vulnerabilities as performed by trained professionals.
SAMPLE QUESTION FROM CSET
Question 12.

Is a disaster recovery plan prepared, tested, and available in the event of a major hardware or
software failure or destruction of the facility? Check all that apply.

electronic connections severed until secure conditions can be restored; Roles and responsibilities of
responders; Processes and procedures for the backup and secure storage of information; Complete
and up-to-date logical network diagram; Personnel list for authorized physical and cyber access to
the ICS; Communication procedure and list of personnel to contact in the case of an emergency
including ICS vendors, network administrators, ICS support personnel, etc.; Current configuration
information for all components.
The plan should also indicate requirements for the timely replacement of components in the case of
an emergency. If possible, replacements for hard-to-obtain critical components should be kept in
inventory.

APPENDIX H

DCIP
DEFENSE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM (DCIP)

[verbatim extract from the DCIP web site http://dcip.dtic.mil/index.html]
DCIP is an integrated risk management program designed to support DOD Mission Assurance
programs. When effectively applied, these programs form a comprehensive structure to secure
critical assets, infrastructure, and key resources for our nation. The nation’s defense and
economic vitality is highly dependent upon the availability and reliability of both DOD and nonDOD owned critical infrastructure (such as: power, transportation, telecommunications, water
supply, etc.). With limited resources to address risk to critical infrastructure, the DCIP relies on
continuous analysis of changing vulnerabilities to all types of threats and hazards to effectively
manage risk to the nation’s most essential infrastructure.
Recognizing how critical the infrastructure is to accomplishing DOD's missions and the effects of
vulnerabilities to threats and hazards of infrastructure assets, DOD Directive 3020.40, DOD
Policy and Responsibility for Critical Infrastructure, established the Defense Critical
Infrastructure Program (DCIP), a program responsible for coordinating the management of risk
to the critical infrastructure that DOD relies upon to execute its missions.
Increased global connectivity and interdependencies create numerous and changing
vulnerabilities. Threats to "soft" targets do not only occur through criminal or terrorist
activities, but also through national disasters, accidents, hazardous weather, and other natural
and man-made events. Our national military strength and economic vitality is highly dependent
upon the availability and reliability of both DOD and non-DOD owned critical infrastructure
(such as: power, transportation, telecommunications, water supply, etc.) However, resources
to address these vulnerabilities are limited and must be channeled to those deemed the highest
priority. Additionally, priorities change as threats, vulnerabilities, and mission requirements
evolve.

APPENDIX K

ICS SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS
Organizations Engaged on ICS Security

The following organizations can advise and assist with ICS vulnerability and risk assessments
mostly using their own sets of tools and SMEs. This is merely a subset of a broader community
engaged on ICS security.
ICS-CERT
http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/ics-cert/
The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) [Dept of Homeland
Defense] provides a control system security focus in collaboration with US-CERT to:
• respond to and analyze control systems related incidents,
• conduct vulnerability and malware analysis,
• provide on-site support for incident response and forensic analysis,
• provide situational awareness in the form of actionable intelligence,
• coordinate the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities/mitigations, and
• share and coordinate vulnerability information and threat analysis through information
products and alerts.
AFCESA
http://www.afcesa.af.mil/
The Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (HQ USAF/A7C) [USAF-centric], CEO Division,
provides (on a scheduled basis) specialized ICS and IT teams to apply the ICS PIT C&A Program.
AFCESA/CEO’s standard procedure is to apply the risk assessment program at Air Forcemanaged installations on a scheduled basis, with a goal of revisitation every three years; they
may visit out-of-cycle on an as-requested basis but will be constrained by already-scheduled
assessments. As of this publication, the AFCESA C&A teams operate under authority of SAF/CIO
A6, and in accordance with DODI 8500.01E, AFI 33-210, and AFCESA ETL 11-1.
262 NWS
http://washingtonairguard.org/194rsw/
The 262d Network Warfare Squadron (262 NWS) is an Air National Guard (ANG) unit operating
on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington. The Washington ANG web site
reflects: Nationally recognized as a Cyber Warfare leader, the 262 NWS conducts worldwide
network security operations to improve the DOD GiG and the Air Force's network security
posture. Recent high-level assessments include the White House Communications Agency, US
Central Command, Space Command, and European Command. They also participate in ongoing responses to Air Force and DOD cyber incidents, all amidst an increasing number of
federal- and state-directed assessments.

ATTACHMENT 1

MAPPING INTERDEPENDENCIES & ASSESSING RISK

With reference to the eight-step process introduced at the beginning of this handbook, this
section will facilitate the following activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mission analysis
ID assets
Determine ICS dependencies
Determine ICS connectivity
Assess risk
Prioritize risk management actions

This leaves the following activities to be addressed by the installation ICS security team.
•
•

Implement actions
Monitor and reenter the cycle as required

Roles and Responsibilities
Facilitator
The Installation Commander should appoint a facilitator for this data collection. The results
from this effort will assist in determining priorities for resource commitment decisions. The
facilitator will have the following responsibilities:
• Authority to gather the required data
• Assembling the experts related to infrastructures that support the missions
• Collating data related to the system dependencies
• Documenting the dependencies of systems, infrastructures, and interconnections
(spreadsheet, database, diagrams, etc.)
The duration of this effort depends on the depth of knowledge and documentation of the
existing systems. Documenting processes that do not exist, have been abandoned, or were
never installed will diminish the value of this. Rigor should be applied to the process of
ensuring the dependencies and interconnects are characterized as precisely as possible. This
activity also may need to be iterative; a lightning strike knocking out power may expose a
connection that was unknown, at which point the diagram/table should be updated as this will
alter the relative importance values. The initial amount of time to allocate would be one hour
per infrastructure or one-half day for a large meeting with several infrastructures. The
facilitated meetings (combined) should not take more than one day for each mission.
Additional time can be determined based on the outcome of the first session. Incomplete
71

groups of data can be collected and documented. Gaps should be noted and filled as experts or
data become available.
CAVEAT: Some data may require a clearance to obtain and may result in generating classified
documents. A derivative classifier or classification authority should be consulted prior to
beginning this effort. The documentation will be, at a minimum, “For Official Use Only.”
Some data may not be obtainable. Remember, this is not documenting how the processes
work; this is documenting the mission dependencies on processes and systems that in turn
depend on one another. Here are examples of utilities and infrastructures that should be part
of this effort:
• Electricity
• Fuel
• Water/Waste Water
• Natural Gas
• Security (gates, doors, surveillance, etc.)
o If security is the mission, then ensure security and the systems/networks security
uses are represented in the diagram. If security is a mitigating measure, then make
notation of this. Essentially, if the doors lock due to a power outage of the security
system, can the mission still function?
• Lights (emergency, runway, search, etc.)
• Emergency Services
• Communications (networks, wired, wireless)
• People (groups, organizations, contractors, etc.)
• Control systems, SCADA systems, HVAC systems, etc.
Subject Matter Experts
The utilities and infrastructures listed above involve people who have expert knowledge about
how they connect to other systems or what systems they depend on. They will be supplying
the data that builds the diagram/table discussed below. How the system works will sometimes
supply additional information on the dependencies and interdependencies.
Example: If the entire water system depends on one electrical feed, then the details of how the
water system works will not be as useful as the fact that there is one electrical connection. If
the details of the water system identify which HVAC, waste water, potable water, and electrical
generation systems depend on the water, then those details are indicating downstream
dependencies that need to be documented.
To focus all participants on the objective of this activity, the facilitator may have to make
leading statements or ask pointed questions such as:
72

•
•
•

“If power were cut, how long can you remain operational?”
“If the temperature in this building reaches 90 degrees, will the equipment remain
functional?”
“If a <insert disaster> destroyed the <insert part of the building>, would that impact our
<insert infrastructure>?”

Using the Diagram
The following figure (Figure Atch1-1) is a representation of a fictitious mission. Each hexagon
represents a system or process boundary. The connections between the systems indicate
dependencies. The numeric values represent the relative value to one another starting with a
base value of 1 for the mission and escalating with each dependency. The rules for escalating
the value will be discussed later in this section. Looking at this figure, what system or group of
systems has the highest value? Are they inside or outside of the jurisdiction boundary?

Figure Atch1-1. Example Mission Interdependencies

The figure has color coded hexagons to make finding items easier. For example, electrical
systems are blue with a yellow outline. The cyber systems (control systems) associated with
the electrical systems are indicated as their own green hexagons. The electrical systems
located at the center bottom of the figure have the highest relative importance. The leased
line, electrical supply, substation A, and their associated cyber systems (control systems) all
have values of 20. The quick meaning is that without electricity, the rest of the systems are
likely to be non-functional. The pumps will no longer work to deliver fuel or water to the
mission. The IT equipment will no longer be powered. The only item that would remain
functional would be the backup generator located to the upper left of the mission (in the
middle). This would allow the mission to function at least until the fuel for the backup
generator was consumed.
Taking another look at the figure, in the upper-right corner there is a virtual local area network
(VLAN) switch with quite a few connections. If there was found a vulnerability that allowed
switching from one VLAN to another, could an intruder from the water cyber system get into
the process cyber system? That VLAN switch concentrates a significant portion of the cyber
traffic around that mission. As such, that component is fairly significant to the successful
operation of the mission. The numeric value of 5 indicates the relative importance.
Without prior knowledge of the mission or how the systems operate, a determination can be
made of the relative importance of the systems with a quick glance. Another potential
representation of this data would be as a topological map imposed on the facility. The highest
point would still be the electrical systems. When attempting to control or secure an area that is
on low ground surrounded by high ground, are defenses placed on the low ground or the high
ground? This diagram and method for generating this diagram should help make that decision,
back that decision up with numeric values based on the infrastructure in place, and then apply
resources as the installation commander sees fit.
Rules for the Mapping of Interdependencies
The following definitions will be useful:
•
•
•
•
•

Missions are comprised of functions
Functions have requirements in terms of utilities, systems, and people
Utilities, systems, and people have requirements as they are supplied by additional
layers
Systems/Process – An object/component or group of objects/components that
accomplish a result
Object / Component – An item or group of items that accomplish a task
o A valve, PLC, temperature indicator, and computer are all components. A system
would be the combination of all of them together performing HVAC. A pumping
station may comprise of several pumps, controllers, communications, and power
components.
o Sometimes an object or component is a system in and of itself. A managed
switch may be necessary to break out as a system boundary because it intersects
several networks and segments them with VLANs.
74

Each layer beyond the initial layer of utilities, systems, and people may comprise a system in
and of itself that needs to be identified by the boundaries. Two separated control systems
running two segmented parts of a system would be two different representations linked by a
process system physical connection. Physical and cyber systems should not be combined so the
impacts to one can be seen on the other. The cyber system should be attached and will inherit
the value from the process. An example is shown in Figure Atch1-2 below. The SCADA/ICS
cyber systems may have several network boundaries they traverse, this is also shown in the
figure where the system on Substation A and the system on Electrical Supply External are using
a Leased Line to communicate. The Leased Line is owned by a different group and the
communications between the two systems depends on it. It is not uncommon to have shared
data highways, such as a fiber optic ring, that infrastructure use to communicate. Treat shared
interconnects (e.g., a fiber optic ring with the associated switch gear) as a system/process.

Figure Atch1-2. ICS Representation

Use the following types of diagrams and drawings to assist in creating the interdependency
diagram:
•
•
•
•
•

Network diagrams
Cabinet drawings
Electrical drawings
Process diagrams
Site location diagrams

Use names or locations for tie-in points to components that are connected to multiple
components or the diagram may become overly cumbersome. An example of what to do is
shown in Figure Atch1-3. The VLANB switch has multiple cyber connections that overlap other
systems. While this does represent the connections, this can make the diagram difficult to
read.

75

Figure Atch1-3. Congested Dependencies

An alternative way of representing multiple connections is to make an additional object with
the same name and make the dependency connections. The difficulty in this solution is in
finding the partners. In Figure Atch1-4, both Substation A and Substation B are split in order to
keep the diagram cleaner. Network boundaries are also shown in Figure Atch1-4. The cyber
systems for the Fuel Supply have a DMZ network with which they both communicate. The DMZ
network then has an additional network that it communicates with where the data from the
Fuel Supply systems is accessed. A historian passing data to an archive server on an IT network
is an example of this type of architecture.

Figure Atch1-4. Decongested Dependencies

76

The diagram itself should show the dependencies of each system relative to the mission going
outward until the installation commander reaches a point where he/she no longer has
ownership. At that point, the system dependencies end as indicated by circles in the diagrams
above.
The numeric values are assigned to each process or system based on this one rule.
•

A system inherits the values of all of those systems that depend on it.
o The mission value is set to 1.
o All other systems derive their values from the mission value.
o Circular connections are handled consistently (choose to either add them or do not
add them)

The easiest way of generating these values is to use a database or a table in Excel. An example
table is shown in Table Atch1-1. Do not generate these values while determining
dependencies. Attempting to do so will not benefit the facilitated meeting. The table should
contain these columns: Process/System Boundary, Zi (relative importance), Dependants, and
geographical information services (GIS) coordinates of the Process/System (optional).
The cells should be linked as indicated by the cell references depicted. The geographical
information services (GIS) data are the GIS coordinates of that component, they are optional. Zi
is the aggregated impact or importance value of the component based on dependencies.

If this were mapped to a GIS map using an alternative elevation of the relative importance, the
data would represent terrain that needs securing. The lower elevations are the items of
interest and the areas of higher relative importance would be key locations to control the
region. The scope of this project prevents the creation of a graphical tool kit so the variations
of the graphical depiction will be based on the people contributing to this activity. A white
board “exercise” would also work to create a physical image depicting the interdependencies.
Generating the diagram and table
The facilitator should use materials they have at hand. A large white board, poster-sized paper
hung on the wall, or poster-sized paper on a tabletop are examples of suitable mediums.
1. Starting with the mission, draw an object and label it “mission” or use the proper
mission name.
2. Describe the mission and its functions to the assembled experts and draw radial lines
outward from the mission object to show dependencies.
Example: The facilitator makes the statement, “The mission is to provide bombers; which
require maintenance, fuel, runways, ordinance, and crew.” The facilitator draws radial lines
outward connecting it to objects labeled “maintenance,” “fuel,.” “runways,” “ordinance,” and
“crew.”
3. The experts assembled should represent people knowledgeable about each function
with which the mission relies. Some experts will know about several functions. In an
78

orderly fashion, capture everyone’s input. Drawing objects and connecting lines to
show the systems/processes and dependencies. Use arrows if the dependency is one
way with the arrow pointing toward the downstream or consumer component. Resolve
conflicts in a professional manner. Resolution may take the form of a field trip, a field
test, or a discussion. If the resolution must be postponed until after the facilitated
session, document the object with a question mark to show uncertainty.
NOTE: Computer networks should be viewed in a frame of consumer/publisher. What
system produces the information and what system consumes the information. The
consumer is dependent on the producer. The producer is not dependent on the
consumer.
4. Document the diagram. This can be done by printing, photographing, or whatever
means is suitable for the medium.
5. Generate a table of Relative Importance of Interdependent Systems based on the
diagram.
6. The table will generate values for each system/process based on the documented
dependencies.

Assessing the risk and prioritizing risk management actions
Assessing the risk and prioritizing the risk management actions on a macro scale requires a
high-level determination of cyber risk. The purpose of the high-level determination is to
prioritize areas of focus to perform more time consuming assessments. Performing this
calculation will take into account how a system is used or monitored.
Calculation of Priority based on Use
Maintenance for mechanical devices is fairly well understood. There are differences in opinions
on how best to perform maintenance. Cyber systems require a different kind of maintenance.
The concern is the chance that, due to a lack of information technology maintenance, the
control system will be an easier target for hacking. A quick search using the NIST National
Vulnerability Database (http://nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search) is presented in Table Atch1-2.
These are the rates of reporting, not necessarily the rate of discovery. Each product has the
vulnerabilities it was created with; products do not create new vulnerabilities by existing. As
interest in a system increases, the number of reported vulnerabilities increases. This is
different from a mechanical device that wears out over time. Programs do not wear out,
though the vendor may discontinue the product.

Access to a control system allows users to perform actions. Stuxnet showed how important this
is. The vulnerabilities used by Stuxnet were not vulnerabilities in the Siemens software; they
were vulnerabilities in the operating system. Once on the consoles, Stuxnet made use of the
Siemens software to perform tasks it was designed to do. Any vulnerability that allows
arbitrary execution of code can allow malicious software access to control system functions
that are available to the user account the vulnerable program is using.

80

A control system uses three methods of user access control:
1. The first is no security. The software will run as the operating system account currently
logged in. These types of systems often run as an administrative level user. If one can
log into the console, one can perform any action on the system such as opening
breakers or valves, adjusting set points, or downloading new configuration to the field
controllers.
2. The second method is a custom user account manager on top of the operating system
accounts. This method can result in security being turned on/off for the control system
and circumstances where no user accounts exist for the control system thereby locking
the console until it is rebuilt with an image or reinstalled. This method will typically use
an auto-login account for the operating system and then have the operations personnel
use their own custom user account to gain access to the control system interfaces. The
auto-login account is often an administrative level user.
3. The third method is to use accounts integrated into the operating system user accounts.
This is more common of systems designed after 2001. This will be a mix of user
accounts with role-based privileges. A look at the processes running on the console will
show a number of user accounts that are control-system specific that likely have
administrative rights, which are used to keep key system functions operational.
This is why software management and system monitoring is important for control systems.
Assume that the system can be compromised then watch the system for aberrant behavior
indicating unstable code. Achieving this level of monitoring takes resources in the form of
people, procedures, and technology. All of which cost money to deploy and maintain. In the
previous section, the interdependencies of the infrastructure were determined and a table was
built. The relative importance to the mission was determined for each system. That value does
not take into consideration operational conditions or mitigation measures in place. The
following columns should be added to the table of relative importance:
• Maintenance (patching, evaluating/testing patches, etc.) performed regularly for
o Operating system
o Hardware
o Third-party software
o Control system software
o Customized software
• System monitoring frequency (how often is the system used/observed)
• System log (all logs) monitoring frequency
• Physical connections
The resulting table with values is shown in Table Atch1-3.

The table additions of columns I through P will be used in the calculation of the relative importance to
mission modified by operational considerations. This value will be called the Cyber Readiness.
Attention should be given to the entries with higher values.
An additional column should be added to the table so the calculations can be automated. For the
purposes of this calculation, row 3 in the table will be used. All cells will be using this reference. C3
represents Zi.
Cyber Readiness
= Log10(C3) * sum(I3:M3) * N3 * O3 * P3
These values are then the risk prioritizations of the ICS/cyber components that support the functions
with which missions rely. The higher values represent more at risk to the system. Some systems will
have mitigations already in place, having the conversation with the system owner can determine if
this is the case. The judgment of what resources to place should never be solely on the numeric
value, however the numeric value can assist in making that determination.

ATTACHMENT 2

CHECKLIST OF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

The following tabular format checklist presents recommendations made earlier in the handbook
using a modified DOTMLPF-F37 construct. The checklist does not cover every last action that may be
taken to secure installation ICS. Additional actions may be identified during assessment or even in
the midst of implementation. Also, this is generic, meaning that applicability is broad rather than
specific. Each installation will have differences, in some cases significant, in control systems
architectures, security measures already in place, organizational and personnel management, and
missions. The “one-size-fits-all” approach offered here will indeed yield a more secure ICS, but a
closer fit will require tailoring (such as using other tools, requesting assistance of SMEs, etc.).
Actions are not listed in a particular order, except that policy should first be well-established so as to
facilitate implementing actions in other areas. Nor do actions need to be implemented sequentially;
many actions may be undertaken in parallel.
NOTE: A separate table may be used for each type of ICS or by mission supported.

The columns in the table are:
• FOCUS:
COTMLPF-P area
• ACTION:
ICS security action to implement
• COMMENTS: Notes/comments about that action
• PRI #:
Priority assigned to the action (self-defined priority scheme and criteria)
• POC:
Person or office with primary responsibility for managing that action
• ASSGND:
Date assigned by installation commander or ICS security team
• DONE:
Date completed

Blank rows are included at the end of each “Focus” section for installation-specific additions.

ICS systems and applications are relatively
static; any change to UAC configuration at
the operating system, application, and data
levels need to be identified immediately and
reviewed for security implications

•

Set timeline and threshold
monitoring requirements for

Event logs (functional and security) need to
be reviewed in a timely manner; it will not do

traffic from privileged user
accounts

As with previous comments, egress traffic
from the ICS networks to the
corporate/military or Internet need to be
evaluated so a baseline of normal egress
traffic can be established; unusual or
anomalous egress traffic from privileged
accounts needs to be identified and
evaluated as quickly as possible

Protect operating system:
•

Disable all unnecessary
network services

•

Use (and keep current) viruschecking software

Virus detection programs may be difficult to
update on live systems, and therefore will
require diligence in maintaining currency

•

Establish software lifecycle
management policy

Out-of-date software of any sort (firmware,
operating system, third party/COTS, custom
code, development frameworks, etc.) should
all be maintained and within n or n-1 releases
of a vendor’s supported software

•

Implement security policies per
vendor best security practices
list

Security configurations should be done on
each OS in addition to the external access
controls like port configuration; this means
disabling autorun, limiting remote registry
access, etc.

•

Consider using IDS

If consider, do so judiciously and in close
consultation with cybersecurity specialists
who probably already had implemented an
IDS on the IT network. Many IDS marketed
specifically for ICS may not actually add more
value to defense than already provided by
the IT side IDS.

Y

Protect data:
Probably not able to encrypt data on the
purely ICS component side, such as between
a PLC and a master server; definitely unable
to encrypt between a PLC and a sensor

•

Encrypt data in motion (at least
on the IT side)

•

Enforce controlled access to
stationary data (files,
databases, etc.)

•

Back up system routinely and
keep backups secure &
accessible

A backup held exclusively by a vendor will not
be “accessible” in certain circumstances, such
as a FPCON Charlie or Delta

•

Implement separate data
management procedures for
business/ICS/operational data
and data configuration files

Data segregation provides another security
layer and helps prevent random failures of
the OS/application from impacting data; since
config files are often transferred from failing
96

systems to the new system without being
checked, malware authors hide RAT software
in them
•

Map the flows of critical data at
least annually to ensure data is
being protected and accessed
appropriately

Identify and map exactly where critical data
goes throughout its usable life cycle to ensure
you know exactly where it can be accessed
and what protections are in place; use a data
flow diagram and threat modeling tools to
ensure appropriate trust boundaries and
technical security controls are in place

Control web services and Internet
access:
•

Disable unnecessary web
services

•

Use “white”/”black” lists

•

Enforce acceptable-use policy
on Internet access and
browsing

•

Use a web application firewall
(WAF) if possible

C
Y

Whitelisting typically is favored over

COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEMS INSTRUCTION 1253 ICS

OVERLAY VERSION 1

BACKGROUND

The CNSSI 1253 ICS Overlay Version 1 was developed by a Technical Working Group (TWG) charted by
the Installations and Environment, Business Enterprise Integration office in 2012. The TWG was
comprised of Subject Matter Experts from DoD, DHS, and NIST and the JTANICS staff. The overlay was
published in January 2013 and incorporated into the DHS CSET 5.1 tool, released in June 2013.
The intent of the overlay was to bridge the gap between the need to have a standardized process
across the DoD to address the growing concern about the lack of ICS cybersecuriity and have basic
“primer” that the engineering, information technology, and information assurance community could
use in preparation for the DoD issuance of the new DoDI 8500 Cybersecurity instruction and adoption
of the NIST Risk Management Framework. The RMF is replacing the Defense Information Assurance
Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP).
At the same time the CNSSI ICS Overlay was being developed, NIST was also updating the NIST SP
800-53 Rev 3 Recommended Security Controls For Federal Information Systems and Organizations,
and the NIST 800-82 Industrial Control Systems Security Guide. As part of the update process, NIST
moved the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3 Appendix I Industrial Control Systems Security Controls,
Enhancements, and Supplemental Guidance to the NIST 800-82 Rev 1 Appendix G. This kept the ICS
guidance and controls in one contiguous document. NIST is in the process of updating the NIST SP
800-82 to incorporate the new controls developed in the NSIT SP 800-53 Rev 4, with a target date of a
spring 2014 release.
The NIST SP 800-82 writers group has incorporated a great deal of the CNSII 1253 Overlay Version 1
content into the draft NIST 800-82 Rev 2, and has created a master ICS Overlay template that can be
used by any organization.
Future versions of the CNSSI 1253 ICS Overlay may simply refer to the NIST SP 800-82 Rev 2 or will be
a very condensed version of this overlay.

Version 1
January 2013

This Draft version of the Overlay is for informational and instructional purposes only and meant
to be used a companion to the DHS Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET). The Draft version is
based on the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3 publication. The Final version is being revised to follow the
new format of the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4 publication.

Forward

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created NIST Special Publication
(SP) 800-53, “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and
Organizations,” to establish a standardized set of information security controls for use within the
United States (U.S.) Federal Government. As part of the Joint Task Force Transformation
Initiative Working Group, the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) has worked
with representatives from the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities to produce a unified
information security framework and to ensure NIST SP 800-53 contains security controls to meet
the requirements of National Security Systems (NSS).
Security control overlays are specifications of security controls and supporting guidance used to
complement the security control baselines and parameter values in CNSSI No. 1253 and to
complement the supplemental guidance in NIST SP 800-53. Organizations select and apply
security control overlays by using the guidance in each of the standardized, approved and CNSSpublished overlays.
An overlay is a specification of security controls and supporting guidance used to complement
the security control baselines and parameter values in CNSSI No. 1253 and to complement the
supplemental guidance in NIST SP 800-53. An overlay’s specifications may be more stringent or
less stringent than the controls and guidance complemented. Overlays may be applied to reflect
the needs of different information types (e.g., personally identifiable information [PII], financial,
or highly sensitive types of intelligence); system functionality needs (e.g., stand-alone systems,
cross domain solutions, or controlled interface systems); or environmental or operationallydriven needs (e.g., tactical, space-based, or test environment).

Industrial Control Systems Overlay

1. Characteristics and Assumptions
The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Overlay applies to Platform IT (PIT) systems. As stated in
DoDD 8500.01 Cybersecurity Directive, Enclosure 3, “Examples of platforms that may include
PIT are:
“weapons, training simulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration
equipment, equipment used in the research and development of weapons systems,
medical technologies, vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles (e.g., electric, bio-fuel,
Liquid Natural Gas that contain car-computers), buildings and their associated control
systems (building automation systems or building management systems, energy
management system, fire and life safety, physical security, elevators, etc.), utility
distribution systems (such as electric, water, waste water, natural gas and steam),
telecommunications systems designed specifically for industrial control systems to
include supervisory control and data acquisition, direct digital control, programmable
logic controllers, other control devices and advanced metering or sub-metering, including
associated data transport mechanisms (e.g., data links, dedicated networks).”
ICSs are physical equipment oriented technologies and systems that deal with the actual running
of plants and equipment, include devices that ensure physical system integrity and meet technical
constraints, and are event-driven and frequently real-time software applications or devices with
embedded software. These types of specialized systems are pervasive throughout the
infrastructure and are required to meet numerous and often conflicting safety, performance,
security, reliability, and operational requirements. ICSs range from non-critical systems, such as
those used for building environmental controls (HVAC, lighting), to critical systems such as the
electrical power grid.
Within the controls systems industry, ICS systems are often referred to as Operational
Technology (OT) systems. Historically, the majority of OT systems were proprietary, analog,
vendor supported, and were not internet protocol (IP) enabled. Systems key components, such as
Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Physical Access
Control Systems (PACs), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), closed circuit television (CCTV),
fire alarm systems, and utility meters are now becoming digital and IP enabled. OT systems use
Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) to monitor the processes, versus Graphical User Interfaces
for IT systems, and most current ICS systems and subsystems are now a combination of
Operational Technologies (OT) and Information Technologies (IT).
An emerging concept in technology is to refer to the hybrid OT and IT ICS systems as cyberphysical systems (CPS). As defined by the National Science Foundation:
“cyber-physical systems are engineered systems that are built from and depend upon the
synergy of computational and physical components. Emerging CPSs will be coordinated,
distributed, and connected, and must be robust and responsive. The CPS of tomorrow
will need to far exceed the systems of today in capability, adaptability, resiliency, safety,
security, and usability. Examples of the many CPS application areas include the smart

electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart medical technologies, nextgeneration air traffic management, and advanced manufacturing.”
As these new technologies are developed and implemented, this Overlay will be updated to
reflect advances in related terminology and capabilities. This Overlay focuses on the current
generation technologies already in the field, and the known technologies likely to remain in
inventory for at least the next ten years.
Figure 1 is a typical electrical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) type system
which shows the HMI at the operators console, the transmission system infrastructure, and the
RTU in the field. At the substation and building level, the meters are monitored in a local Energy
Operations Center (EOC) or Regional Operations Center (ROC), which use real time analytics
software to manage the energy loads and building control systems, down to the sensor or actuator
device level.

Figure 1 – ICS Human Machine Interface, System, Remote Terminal Unit38
ICSs differ significantly from traditional administrative, mission support and scientific data
processing information systems, and use specialized software, hardware and protocols. ICS
systems are often integrated with mainstream organizational information systems to promote
connectivity, efficiency, and remote access capabilities. The “front end” portions of these ICSs
resemble traditional information systems in that they use the same commercially available
hardware and software components. While the majority of an ICS system still does not resemble
a traditional information system (IS), the integration of the ICS’s “front end” with IS introduces
some of the same vulnerabilities that exist in current networked information systems.
ICSs can have long life spans (in excess of 20 years) and be comprised of technology that in
accordance with Moore’s law suffers rapid obsolescence. This introduces two issues: first,

depending upon the relative age and isolation of the system, there may not be a patch or upgrade
path for components of the system, and second, attempting to patch the component or employing
modern scanning methods might disrupt the system. ICSs have experienced complete system
shutdown when an intrusion detection system (IDS) or host-based scanning system (HBSS) scan
is performed on an otherwise operational ICS. For an ICS, updates should be delayed until after
a thorough analysis of deployment impact has been completed. This might stretch out security
update timeliness and require flexibility in security control compliance measurement and
enforcement.
While many Information Assurance (IA) controls from the baselines can be applied to an ICS,
how they are implemented varies, primarily because of technical and operational constraints and
differences in the evaluation of risk between ICSs and standard ISs. Interconnections between
ICSs and the organizational network and business systems expose ICSs to exploits and
vulnerabilities, and any attempts to address these exploits and vulnerabilities must consider the
constraints and requirements of the ICS. These constraints can be both technical - most ICS
components have limited storage and processing capacity – or practical, as most ICSs are
funding and personnel constrained so resources allocated to IA are removed from other functions
(such as maintenance), which often adversely impacts the function of the ICS. Unlike most ISs,
ICSs are driven primarily by availability, which requires a different approach to making IA
decisions.

A significant change in DoDD 8500.01 Cybersecurity Directive, Enclosure 3, is to eliminate the
use of the term Platform IT Interconnection (PITI), and adopt Integration and Interoperability:
“All interconnections of DoD IT will be managed to minimize shared risk by ensuring that
the security posture of one system is not undermined by vulnerabilities of interconnected
systems.
Interconnections between PIT systems and DoD ISs must be protected either by
implementation of security controls on the PIT system or the DoD IS.”
In this Overlay, the terms IT and OT are used to define the Tiers Architecture and delineate the
boundary between the PIT and DoD IS.
Implementing security controls in ICS environments should take advantage of the concept of
common security controls in order to mitigate the constraints caused by the characteristics of
those environments. By centrally managing and documenting the development, implementation,
assessment, authorization, and monitoring of common controls and security services,
organizations can decrease the resources associated with implementing security controls for
individual systems without sacrificing the protections provided by those controls, and security
controls are then implemented as part of a greater security environment. For example, a control
implemented within a service provided by an EOC may be inherited by a system on a mobile
platform (i.e. field power generation). Networked systems can, and will, depend on one another
for security protections or services as part of a defense in depth strategy. Controls meant to be
common across connected systems – access controls, for example – can be provided once and
inherited across many, assuming the implementation is adequate to support multiple systems.
Every implementation of common controls requires analysis from a risk management
perspective, with careful communication among representatives from all interconnected systems
and organizations. The new Advanced Meter Infrastructure shown in Figure 2 is being installed
on Department of Defense (DoD) buildings, and highlights the challenges and complexities of
the new hybrid OT systems. Unfortunately, due to the issues associated with implementing IA
for older ICSs, many older (legacy) ICSs will operate in isolation and may be unable to make use
of many of the common controls.

The ICS tier architecture is used to define the accrediation boundary for OT systems and is a
logical representation of the OT network. The actual physical system can span many miles; for
example, locks and dams, pipelines, electric transmission and distribution systems can have
many non-contiguous components, and there are a number of protocols commonly used by ICSs
to allow the devices within the tiers to communicate both horizontally and vertically. Some of

The ICS Architecture is described in five Tiers (and multiple sub-tiers), where each tier
represents a collection of components that can be logically grouped together by function and IA
approach. There are several critical considerations to the tiered architecture:
1) Not every implementation of an ICS will make use of every tier;
2) The same device may reside in different tiers, depending on its configuration. For
example, some BACnet controllers may support different networks based on a dual inline packet (DIP) switch, and thus the same device could reside in either Tier 1 or Tier 2.
3) In some cases, a single device may simultaneously fit into two principal tiers. For
example, a device may act as both a Tier 2 controller and a Tier 3 Facility Point of
Connection (FPOC).
4) In many cases, a device will fit multiple sub-tiers within the same principal tier, usually
within Tier 2. For example, a Tier 2A BACnet controller will often act as a Tier 2C
router to a Tier 1 network beneath it.
5) A single device may belong in different tiers, depending on the specific architecture. For
example, the Tier 2A/2C controller in the example above may, in a small system, be the
only IP device, in which case it is also the Tier 3 FPOC. In a larger system, there would
be multiple IP devices and the upstream IP device (EUB switch or router) would be the
Tier 3 FPOC.

Generally speaking from the perspective of
ICSs functionality, this connection should be
severely restricted, if not eliminated entirely.
The ICSs can function in a completely isolated
configuration. Additional functionality allowed
through external connections includes:
• Sending alarm notification using outbound
access to a SMTP email server.
• Upload of historical data and meter data to an
enterprise server using outbound
HTTP/HTTPS access for uploading.

Often it is desirable to allow inbound HTTP
from web clients (essentially Tier 4B clients,

For each field control system, the FPOC is the
specific single demarcation point in the OT
system between that field control system and
the front end system. It may be a gateway that
translates data from one protocol to another. It
generally has IA components in that it restricts
access (by user, protocol, or specific
commands) between tiers above and tiers
below. From a control architecture perspective,
it often looks and functions identically to a Tier
2C device. For a non-IP network (Tier 1), the
FPOC is the device that connects the non-IP
network to IP. For an IP network (Tier 2), the
FPOC is the device located at the single
connection point between the IP network in Tier
2 and the UMCS IP network; this is typically
the upstream IP networking hardware (EUB
switch or router).

controller in the system (generally with a Tier 1
network beneath it). In these cases, we may
consider the controller the FPOC, or we may
consider the upstream IP networking hardware
(EUB switch or router) to be the FPOC.
Similarly, a device normally at Tier 2C could be
the Tier 3 FPOC. Finally, we may have a Tier
2D computer which is the only IP device in the

FPOC.

This device is critical from an IA
perspective as it is where the
dedicated local field control
network connects to the basewide network. Normally,
securing this device protects the
base-wide network from the local
field systems (which often have a
difficult time meeting IA
controls). Occasionally, where
there is a critical field control
system, this device can protect the
more critical field control system
from the less-secure base-wide
system (i.e., where there are 99
non-critical systems and 1 critical
one, isolate the 1 from the 99
rather than try and secure the 99).

This device should, in effect, have
a "deny all / permit exception"
policy applied. In many cases,
this is inherent in the design of
the network – a Tier 1 (non-IP)
network inherently "denies" all
protocols other than its specific
control protocol. In other cases,
this device may be a gateway
("application layer proxy") that
does not permit any networking
traffic through it, and only
supports a very limited set of
control functionality to pass.
These devices tend to be very
"dumb" devices and may not
support many of the IA controls,
but the critical "deny all / permit
exception" approach should be

Tier 2C may also contain control protocol

generally physically part of a Tier 2A
controller. In addition, from an IA perspective,
they appear much the same as a Tier 2A
controller.

(Tier 2D) In some cases, for either legacy or
stand-alone systems (not necessarily isolated,
but stand alone in that they do not rely on
another system such as an UMCS), the front
end operator interface may be physically local
to that system. In this case, the operator
interface is considered to be part of Tier 2 since
it does not ride over the UMCS IP network.

interface

Since it contains a variety of
components from controllers
(Tier 2A) to computers (Tier 2D),
there is a variety of IA
considerations for this tier. Many
of the controllers will have the
same limitations as the controllers
in Tier 1, where most IA controls
cannot/or will not apply to them.
Some controllers will have
significantly more capability,
however, and additional controls
will be applicable. In either case,
the controllers should disable any
network connections or services
not required for operation of the
OT system.

In some systems, particularly
legacy systems, the computers at
Tier 2D may be running an older
operating systems and may not
support some of the IA controls.
In this case, the controls which
can be applied without negatively
affecting the availability of the
system should be applied, and
mitigating controls and measures
should be taken when otherwise
needed. Generally this will
consist of further isolating the
legacy systems.

While functionally, Tier 2D components act
similarly to computers at Tier 4, the fact that
they are local to (and dedicated to) a specific
control systems means that from an IA
perspective, they are better addressed as Tier 2
components. Tier 2D computers will often have
another network logically beneath them, most
often a non-IP network (and thus also function
as Tier 2C devices).

(Tier 1A) This is where the control logic
resides and gets converted to/from analog
electrical signals, as well as the portion of the
OT system where:

1
Non-IP Portion of the Field Control
System

1N – Network (Non-IP)
1A – Networked Controllers
(Non-IP)

• Analog electrical signals (from sensors) get
converted to digital signals via analog-todigital (A-D) converters*
• Digital information is converted to analog
electrical signals (to actuators) via digital-toanalog (D-A) converters *
• Digital information is transmitted and received
over a network
• Digital information is processed according to a
user-defined sequence to generate new digital
information
• Devices may incorporate integral Tier 0
sensors and actuators, for example, a variable
air volume (VAV) box controller incorporates
an electric actuator

(Tier 1A) Firmware based dedicated digital
processors, typically equipped with multiple
analog inputs and outputs and corresponding AD and D-A converters. These devices are
driven by cost to have the minimal functionality
for the application and are very constrained in
random access memory (RAM), processing
power, and network input/output (I/O). In
addition, these devices come in a vast variety of
architectures, processors, vendors, and
firmware.

• Controls contractor during
installation or renovation of
underlying mechanical or
electrical system
• Generally during new building
construction or major renovation

(Tier 1N) The network media and hardware is
similarly dedicated to that specific control
protocol. There are layer 2 and layer 3 network
devices made by a variety of vendors.

*Note that not all controllers will have
hardware inputs.

• VAV box controllers
• Networked (non-IP) electric
meter
• Intelligent (networked)
thermostat
• LonWorks TP/XF-1250 (media)
to TP/FT-10 (media) layer 3
router

Since devices (controllers) in this
tier tend to be simpler devices,
often few IA controls can be
applied, particularly after the
system has been designed and
installed. Some basic
controls/measures that can be
applied at this tier include:
• Disabling (or at a minimum
prohibiting) secondary network
connections (connections other
than to the Tier 1 network)
• The use of passwords on devices
such as displays (to the
capability supported by the
device – many of which do not
permit 14 character passwords,
for example)
• The application of physical
security measures – which will
be dictated and implemented by
the underlying equipment

Note that while there is exchange of data over
the network, good design practice dictates (and
DoD Guide Specifications require) that most of
the data processing occurs using local sensor
data and local actuator outputs; the system is
designed to minimize dependence on networked
data.

(Tier 1N) The Tier 1 network (media and
hardware) does not use IP. It uses a variety of
media at layers 1 and 2 (some standard, some
not) and it uses layer 3 protocols other than IP.
Some examples are:

• BACnet over MS/TP, or BACnet over ARCnet
• LonTalk over TP/FT-10 or LonTalk over
TP/XF-1250
• Modbus over RS-485

For this reason, it is generally very specific to
the control application and cannot be used for
"standard" IT protocols and applications.

Mission Criticality
The objective of this overlay is to develop the baseline of Low, Moderate, and High Impact
ICSs, and define the accreditation boundary and types of devices typically found on an ICS. A
Low Impact ICSs addresses the “80%” non-critical systems (i.e., typical office, administrative,
housing, warehouse, et al. buildings control systems). Many of the Moderate and High Impact
systems are listed as Task Critical Assets in the Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection (DCIP)
program, and are classified at the Secret level or higher. Figure 10 illustrates the conceptual
types of ICSs and criticality. There are approximately 400 plus major military installations and
operating sites. For this Overlay, the ICS systems PIT boundary is defined as the Enclave and
Installation Processing Node. Currently, there are 611 controls in the CNSSI 1253, of which 197
have been determined to apply for ICSs.

Figure 10 – ICSs Criticality

For ICSs systems, it is extremely important to recognize that availability is often of much more
significance than confidentiality or integrity. Additionally, ICS systems do not have a distinct

be a Mission Dependent primary system that supports a Mission Critical Data Center system
with secondary generator back up, but if primary power is lost, the system will have degraded
capability, and restoration of the primary electric is essential for long-term mission completion.

2. Applicability

The following questions are used to determine whether or not this overlay applies to a Low
Impact ICS system:
1. Does the ICS have a CNSSI 1253 C-I-A rating of Low-Low-Low or less, where “loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals”?
2. Is the ICS part of a real property asset listed in the DoD Federal Real Property Profile
(FRPP) and listed as “Not Mission Dependent – mission unaffected”?
3. Is the ICS designated a prior DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation
Process (DIACAP) “Mission Assurance Category 3 – These systems handle information
that is necessary for the conduct of day-to-day business, but does not materially affect
support to deployed or contingency forces in the short-term”?
 If the answer is yes to any of the questions, STOP here and use the Low Impact
overlay.
The following questions are used to determine whether or not this overlay applies to a Moderate
ICS system:
1. Does the ICS have a CNSSI 1253 C-I-A rating of Moderate-Moderate-Moderate or less,
where “loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a
serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
individuals”?
2. Is the ICS part of a real property asset listed in the DoD FRPP and listed as “Mission
Dependent, Not Critical – does not fit into Mission Critical or Not Mission Dependent
categories”?
3. Is the ICS designated a prior DIACAP “Mission Assurance Category 2 – Systems
handling information that is important to the support of deployed and contingency forces.
Loss of availability is difficult to with and can only be tolerated for a short time”?
4. Has the installation commander designated the ICS as producing critical information?
 If the answer is yes to any of the questions, STOP here and use the Moderate Impact
overlay.

APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

Attachment 1 to Appendix K

The following questions are used to determine whether or not this overlay applies to a High ICS
system:
1. Does the ICS have a CNSSI 1253 C-I-A rating of High-High-High or less, where “loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or
catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
individuals”?
2. Is the ICS part of a real property asset listed in the DoD FRPP and listed as “Mission
Critical – without constructed asset or parcel of land, mission is compromised”?
3. Is the ICS designated a prior DIACAP “Mission Assurance Category 1 – Systems
handling information that is determined to be vital to the operational readiness or mission
effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both content and timeliness.
The consequences of loss or availability are unacceptable and could include the
immediate and sustained loss of mission effectiveness”?
4. Is the ICS a DCIP Tier 1 Task Critical Asset listed as “an asset, the loss, incapacitation,
or disruption of which could result in mission (or function) failure at the DoD, Military
Department, Combatant Command, sub-unified command, Defense Agency, or defense
infrastructure level”?
5. Is the ICS a DCIP Tier 2 Task Critical Asset listed as “an asset, the loss, incapacitation,
or disruption of which could result in severe mission (or function) degradation at the
DoD, Military Department, Combatant Command, sub-unified command, Defense
Agency, or defense infrastructure level”?
6. Is the ICS a DCIP Tier 3 Task Critical Asset listed as “an asset, the loss, incapacitation,
or disruption of which could result in mission (or function) failure below the DoD,
Military Department, Combatant Command, sub-unified command, Defense Agency, or
defense infrastructure level”?
7. Has the installation commander designated the ICS as producing critical information?
 If the answer is yes to any of the questions, the High Impact overlay applies. In some
of the highest criticality installations the addition of controls during tailoring (above
and beyond the overlay) will be required.
If you did not answer yes to any of these questions, go back and re-evaluate your answers to the
questions related to Low and Moderate systems.

The ICS Overlay can apply to all the baselines defined in CNSSI No. 1253. The overlay does
not require any other overlays to provide the needed protection for systems within ICS
environments. Care should be taken when tailoring information systems that contain ICS
information, since numerous security controls are required by legislation, building code, and
transportation code. See Section 7 for the list of security controls required to meet
regulatory/statutory requirements.

5. Supplemental Guidance

The security controls and control enhancements are likely candidates for tailoring, with the
applicability of scoping guidance indicated for each control/enhancement. The citation of a
control without enhancements (e.g., AC-17) refers only to the base control without any
enhancements, while reference to an enhancement by a parenthetical number following the
control identification (e.g., AC-17(1)) refers only to the specific control enhancement.
Organizations are required to conduct a risk assessment, taking into account the tailoring and
supplementation performed in arriving at the agreed-upon set of security controls for the ICS, as
well as the risk to the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation being incurred by operation of the ICS with the intended controls. Based on an
evaluation of the risk, the organization will further tailor the control set obtained using this
overlay by adding or removing controls in accordance with the CNSSI 1253 process. The
addition or removal of controls during tailoring requires justification.
CNSSI No. 1253

of the security controls and control enhancements to ICSs and the environments in which these
specialized systems operate. The supplemental guidance also provides information as to why a
particular security control or control enhancement may not be applicable in some ICSs
environments and may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping guidance
and/or compensating controls).
The systems controls supplemental guidance provided below is a combination of NIST 800-53
Rev 3 Appendix I, and the DoD ICSs-PIT Technical Working Group decision to include
definitive text for each control as well as guidance on how to apply a control for OT and the

individual having multiple critical privileges.
AC-7 UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS
ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support account/node
locking or delayed login attempts, or the ICS cannot perform account/node locking or
delayed logins due to significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or reliability, the
organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., logging or recording all
unsuccessful login attempts and alerting ICS security personnel though alarms or other
means when the number of organization-defined consecutive invalid access attempts is
exceeded) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Applies to Tiers 2d, 4a and 4b
AC-8 SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION
ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support system use
notification, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., posting
physical notices in ICS facilities) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Applies to Tiers 2d, 4a and 4b
AC-11 SESSION LOCK
ICS Supplemental Guidance: The ICS employs session lock to prevent access to specified
workstations/nodes. The ICS activates session lock mechanisms automatically after an
organizationally defined time period for designated workstations/nodes on the ICS. In
some cases, session lock for ICS operator workstations/nodes is not advised (e.g., when
immediate operator responses are required in emergency situations). Session lock is not a
substitute for logging out of the ICS. In situations where the ICS cannot support session
lock, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing

IA-2 USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL
USERS)
CNSSI No. 1253

151

APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

Attachment 1 to Appendix K

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Where users function as a single group (e.g., control room
operators), user identification and authentication may be role-based, group-based, or
device-based. For certain ICS, the capability for immediate operator interaction is critical.
Local emergency actions for ICS are not hampered by identification or authentication
requirements. Access to these systems may be restricted by appropriate physical security
controls. In situations where the ICS cannot support user identification and
authentication, or the organization determines it is not advisable to perform user
identification and authentication due to significant adverse impact on performance,
safety, or reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g.,
providing increased physical security, personnel security, and auditing measures) in
accordance with the general tailoring guidance. For example, manual voice authentication
of remote personnel and local, manual actions may be required in order to establish a
remote access. (See AC-17 ICS Supplemental Guidance in this Appendix.) Local user
access to ICS components is enabled only when necessary, approved, and authenticated.
Applies to Tiers 2d, 4a, and 4b

Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV)

An AFV is a vehicle that runs on a fuel other
than "traditional" petroleum fuels (petrol or
diesel); and also refers to any technology of
powering an engine that does not involve
solely petroleum (e.g. electric car, hybrid
electric vehicles, solar powered).

Advanced Metering Infrastructure
(AMI)

Advanced metering systems are comprised of
state-of-the-art electronic/digital hardware and
software, which combine interval data
measurement with continuously available
remote communications. These systems enable
measurement of detailed, time-based
information and frequent collection and
transmittal of such information to various
parties. AMI typically refers to the full
measurement and collection system that
includes meters at the customer site,
communication networks between the
customer and a service provider, such as an
electric, gas, or water utility, and data reception and management systems
The term BACnet is used in two ways. First
meaning the BACnet Protocol Standard - the
communication requirements as defined by
ASHRAE-135 including all annexes and
addenda. The second to refer to the overall
technology related to the ASHRAE-135
protocol.
A BAS is a distributed control system. The
control system is a computerized, intelligent
network of electronic devices designed to
monitor and control the mechanical
electronics, and lighting systems in a building.
BAS core functionality keeps the building
climate within a specified range, provides
lighting based on an occupancy schedule, and
monitors system performance and device
failures and provides email and/or text
notifications to building engineering or
maintenance staff. The BAS functionality
reduces building energy and maintenance costs
when compared to a non-controlled building.

roadways in urban areas, or behind homes or
commercial facilities; entry lights can be used
outside to illuminate and signal the entrance to
a property. These lights are installed for safety,
security, and for decoration. Message boards
are used to control vehicle and pedestrian
traffic, as scrolling information at property and
building entrances, and at transit nodes to
display arrival and departure times. Message
boards can be LED, plasma, or light bulb
displays.
The FPOC is the point of connection between
the UMCS network backbone (an IP network)
and the field control network (either an IP
network or a non-IP network). The hardware at
this location which provides the connection is
referred to as the FPOC Hardware. FPOC
hardware takes the form of a control protocol
router, a control protocol gateway, or an IP
device such as a switch or firewall. In general,
the term "FPOC Location" means the place
where this connection occurs, and "FPOC
Hardware" means the device that provides the
connection. Sometimes the term "FPOC" is
used to mean either and its actual meaning (i.e.
