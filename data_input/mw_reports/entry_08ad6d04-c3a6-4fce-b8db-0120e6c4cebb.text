Discovery of the Ammyy
RAT and CLOP Ransomware

A recent rise in attacks using malicious macros in attachments has been spotted in South Korea. In
February 2019, a remote control hacking tool called Flawed Ammyy RAT began to be distributed
through email attachments. This hacking tool has been active since 2016 and has been distributed
worldwide via email. It was mainly mentioned in the media in 2018.

Also, a variant of the Cryptomix ransomware, CLOP, was discovered at a similar time. CLOP is a new
variant that had recently received global attention for its attempt to attack networks worldwide.

AhnLab analyzed the two malware, the Ammyy RAT and CLOP ransomware and found that they
shared further similarities, including the same signatures and same attack targets. This report details
the result of the analysis conducted by the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) on
the distribution method, attack method, and the comparison of the two malware.

1. Overview of the Flawed Ammyy RAT Attack
Flawed Ammyy is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The attacker used the spam emails to distribute the
malware. Usually, spam emails without malicious attachments tend to encourage users to download
and run malicious files. While this is not the case for Flawed Ammyy, it does trick users into believing

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

4

that the attachment is important by giving a name that seems to be work related. This method does
not raise much suspicion, which increases the likelihood of users opening the attachment.

Once the user downloads and opens the malicious attachment in the form of an Excel file,
a macro-enabling button appears. This is a social-engineering method used by the threat
actors that lures users into clicking the "Enable Contents" button at the top of the screen on
Microsoft Office programs that have the macro setting disabled.

Distributing malware through this method is a widely chosen attack method because general
users do not know that a backdoor can be installed just by clicking this button. But unlike
most general Office files that use Visual Basic for Application (VBA), the attachment of Flawed
Ammyy use XML macros. XML is the macro used in the Excel version prior to 4.0. VBA that is
frequently used in the general malicious documents was introduced from Excel 5.0.

Most malicious Office files use VBA to create macros that download, drop, and execute
malware. And while there has been a rise in the attack methods that use PowerShell. This
attack is special for using the macro creation method used in the early version of Excel
programs to avoid detection by the security programs.

The malicious attachment of Flawed Ammyy contains hidden sheets. When unhidden, it
shows commands as shown in Figure 1-1. This command is how the malware downloads the
MSI file from the malicious server using the msiexec.exe process.

The malicious MSI file downloaded from the server contains an executable (EXE) file, which

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

5

Figure 1-1 | Malware Download Method using XML

also downloads another executable file which is the actual malicious backdoor. Before running
the executable file, the malware inspects the running processes and if any anti-virus program is
running, as shown in Figure 1-2, it ends the anti-virus program.

Figure 1-2 | Routine of Inspecting the Vaccine Processes

Then, the encoded file is downloaded from a set URL, and when the decoding process is
finally performed, an exe-type malware is generated. The downloader is deleted once the
malware is installed. This executable malware is the actual "Flawed Ammyy RAT," the hacking
tool conducting malicious acts.

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

Figure 1-3 | Attack Flow of Malware

Figure 1-3 shows a series of processes from downloading Flawed Ammyy RAT. The threat actor
effectively bypasses detection of antivirus programs by using XLM-based attacks, exploiting the
fact that many anti-virus programs are designed to target the VBA macros in Office documents.

Also, the threat actor does not download and run the malicious file directly but used the
indirect method through the downloader by using the feature of the legitimate msiexec,
which installs an external MSI file. A similar method is applied to malware that acts as
a backdoor, such as Flawed Ammyy RAT, which is downloaded in an encoded form and
decoded before installation. Flawed Ammyy RAT checks the list of running processes and
terminates itself without conducting any actions if any of the anti-virus programs are running.
It also disguises itself like a legitimate program by signing each binary with a valid certificate,
unlike malware that is signed with invalid certificates or with no certificates at all.

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

7

Flawed Ammyy RAT is a malware that has been designed based on a leaked source code of
Ammyy Admin, a remote desktop program. The Ammyy Admin program contains control
functions for remote computers, such as file transfer and screen capture. It is believed
that the threat actor created RAT malware by adding and modifying the code to perform
malicious actions based on the source code.

Analysis of the initial routine of Flawed Ammyy showed that it checks the currently running
processes similar to the downloader and shuts the anti-virus program down if it is running. In
addition, it has been confirmed that the basic information, such as OS information, authority,
and username, is sent to the server so that the server can access the computer.

2. Relationship between Flawed Ammyy RAT and CLOP Ransomware
As mentioned earlier, Flawed Ammyy RAT contains not only the main malware but also a
valid signature of the downloader. Unlike other malware that contains invalid certificates, the
advantage of Flawed Ammyy RAT is that its binary is signed and distributed via many valid
certificates. And such similarity was found in the CLOP ransomware that recently targeted
South Korean companies.

ASEC saw a similarity in the two and found that there was a case where these two malware
were signed with the same certificate. Figure 1-4 and Figure 1-5 show the properties of the
CLOP ransomware and Flawed Ammyy RAT, which were signed using the same certificates
"MAN TURBO (UK) LIMITED" and "DELUX LTD," respectively.

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

8

Figure 1-4 | MAN TURBO (UK) LIMITED Certificate

Figure 1-5 | DELUX LTD Certificate

Another common feature of Flawed Ammyy RAT and CLOP ransomware is that they are
distributed to enterprise users, not general users. Unlike most ransomware, which target at
a large number of general users, CLOP targets companies. The distribution and the infection
method is yet to be confirmed. The only known fact is that the attack infects the central
management server and inserts the malware in the system connected to the management
server.

Recently, a change has been found on the downloader of Flawed Ammyy. A routine for
detecting the enterprise user environment has been added after the process of inspecting
the running antivirus programs. As shown in Figure 1-6, it runs the "net user /domain"
command and checks that the WORKGROUP text string is output. The WORKGROUP string

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

9

will be output for general users because there are no special settings, but for enterprise
users, group name set for each environment can be output. If WORKGROUP is output, it was
terminated without conducting any malicious acts such as downloading and installing the
Flawed Ammyy RAT malware.

Figure 1-6 | Routine of Inspecting the WORKGROUP Text String

3. Operation Method of CLOP Ransomware
The CLOP ransomware is registered and executed as a system service, as shown in Figure 1-7.
If it does not run as a service, it does not operate properly.

Figure 1-7 | Execution Method of CLOP Ransomware

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

10

Also CLOP terminates certain processes before proceeding with file encryption. It is presumed
that this is to encrypt more objects in the process of encryption. The targeted processes are
shown in Figure 1-8.
The characteristic feature of the CLOP
ransomware is that it excludes some paths
and files from encryption. Figure 1-9 shows
the encryption exclusion paths. If the path
contains the relevant string, it is excluded
Figure 1-8 | List of Force-terminated Processes

from the encryption.

Figure 1-10 shows the encryption exclusion
file list. Like the exclusion path, any file
name with the string is excluded from the
Figure 1-9 | Encryption Exclusion Path

encryption target.

Figure 1-10 | Encryption Exclusion Files

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

11

As shown in Figure 1-11, the public key of the threat actor is included in the file, and the
public key is used to encrypt the files.

Figure 1-11 | Public Key of the Ransomware Threat Actor

Also, CLOP uses the AES algorithm for file encryption. On the symmetric key generated by
the user PC, it inserts the “Clop ^_-” sign of CLOP, as shown in Figure 1-12, and encrypts
the symmetric key used as the public key of the threat actor and adds it to the end of the
signature.

Figure 1-12 | Signature of Encrypted File

The Figure 1-13 shows the comparison of the file structure before and after the encryption.

Figure 1-13 | File Comparison Before and After Encryption

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

12

In the end, the file name is changed to [Original file name].Clop, as shown in Figure 1-14.
Through the findings and similarities
between the two malware, we can deduce
that Flawed Ammyy RAT is used as one of the
infection vectors of the CLOP ransomware,
Figure 1-14 | Encrypted File

even though its distribution method and

infection method are not yet confirmed. This is because Flawed Ammyy RAT can execute
commands to steal information and install malware via remote control. The Figure 1-15
summarizes the distribution method of threat actor using two malicious codes of Flawed
Ammyy RAT and CLOP ransomware.

Figure 1-15 | Presumed Distribution Method

4. Conclusion
The analysis conduct by ASEC found many similarities between the Flawed Ammyy RAT and
CLOP ransomware, such as an overlap in the activity period, direct targeting of Korean users,
routines to bypass the antivirus program, and signing and distribution of various malware
including variants using a valid certificate. In addition, they share the same signature and

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

13

they both target enterprise users, which makes it highly likely that they are produced by the
same threat actor.

It is important to keep Windows security patches and anti-virus programs up-to-date in order
to minimize the risk of malware, such as Flawed Ammyy RAT, CLOP ransomware, and so on.
Also, it is necessary to pay extra attention to the execution of attachments, such as emails,
from untrusted sources in the company and to refrain from visiting unauthorized web pages.

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

ANALYSIS-IN-DEPTH

Shadow of WannaCry,
2019 SMB Exploitation

WannaCry (or WannaCryptor), which infected more than 300,000 systems in May 2017
and gripped the whole world in fear, spread rapidly by exploiting a Windows SMB security
vulnerability (MS17-010). Precaution is required since the recently discovered malware is a
CoinMiner, a type of malware that mines cryptocurrency.

This report details the analysis by AhnLab on the attack cases that exploited the SMB
vulnerability (MS17-010) from 2018 to the first quarter of 2019.

1. NRSMiner Malware Attack (2018)
In March 2018, a company was found infected with NRSMiner malware. By exploiting the
SMB vulnerability (MS17-010) like WannaCryptor, this malware scans the internal network of
the company and installs the malware that mines the cryptocurrency Monero if the system is
vulnerable. NRSMiner consists of a package file in the ZIP compressed file format, and has a
different filename for the package "MsraReportDataCache32.tlb" for each variant.

Figure 2-1 shows the structure of the NRSMiner package. Once the system is infected, one of
the file names, Srv or Srv64, is changed to "tpmagentservice.dll" according to the installed OS

environment and is registered as a service.
This then later creates and executes the attack
modules and the mining tool later. Spoolsv
and Spoolsv64 executables load the package
file, installs necessary modules depending
on the environment, and scans the MS17010 vulnerability in the system. Hash and
Hash64 are XMRig, a public tool known to
Figure 2-1 | Structure of the NRSMiner Package

mine Monero. Crypt is a compressed folder

containing publicly available MS17-010 vulnerability-related tools and files.

Figure 2-2 | Flow of the Spoolsv.exe Execution

Figure 2-2 shows how the Spoolsv.exe file runs an attack module. This file performs the
function of unpacking the "MsraReportDataCache32.tlb" package and loading the internal
modules. As shown in Figure 2-1, the TLB file consists of: XMRig (Public Monero mining tool)

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

17

called hash and hash64, attack modules called spoolsv and spoolsv64, main modules called
srv and srv64, and a compressed file in the name of Crypt that includes tools and files related
to the EternalBlue SMB vulnerability (MS17-010). When the Spoolsv.exe file is executed, it
runs six threads and performs the following series of steps.

First, it creates a folder in the system as shown in Table 2-1, loads the malicious package file,
and decompresses the loaded file.
-

%Windows%\SecureBootThemes\
%Windows%\SecureBootThemes\Microsoft\
%Windows%\System32\MsraReportDataCache32.tlb //*Decompresses the TLB (.tlb.zip) file
%Windows%\SecureBootThemes\Microsoft\crypt //Delete file once decompressed

Table 2-1 | Folder Generated by the Spoolsv.exe File

To propagate the SMB vulnerability exploit, it runs the svchost.exe (Eternalblue-2.2.0.exe)
and the spoolsv.exe (Doublepulsar-1.3.1.exe) file in the Crypt compression folder inside the
MsraReportDataCache32.tlb file. Depending on the Windows environment, the x64.dll or x86.
dll file is loaded and the file names are hard-coded in spoolsv64.exe.

Finally, a vulnerability scan is conducted within the thread of the spoolsv64.exe process. If
successful, it copies the TLB file from the x64.dll and x86.dll module to the target system and
conducts decompressions. Then the filename is changed to "tpmagentservice.dll," the srv
service is registered, and the spoolsv64.exe file is executed again.

The internal network propagation using the vulnerability proceeds as shown in Figure 2-3.
The example is based on the x64 window.

Figure 2-3 | Configuration File of the EternalBlue Attack Tool

When the EternalBlue tool is executed, two log files stage1.txt and stage2.txt are created as
shown in Table 2-2.
cmd.exe /c C:\WINDOWS\SecureBootThemes\Microsoft\\svchost.exe > stage1.txt // Eternalblue
cmd.exe /c C:\WINDOWS\SecureBootThemes\Microsoft\\spoolsv.exe > stage2.txt // Doublepulsar

Table 2-2 | Generated Log File

The stage1.txt file is the execution log file of the EternalBlue tool, and details are shown in
Figure 2-4.

Figure 2-4 | EternalBlue Log File

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

19

The vulnerability packet is also sent to the target system as shown in Figure 2-5.

Figure 2-5 | Vulnerability Packet Transmission

Then the lsass.exe file creates a malicious package file, MsraReportDataCache32.tlb, in the
remote system it has infiltrated the system. The content of this package file is shown in Figure
2-6. The package file records information in 102,400 bytes each time to the file and directly
sends the plain binary without the additional step of encryption.

Figure 2-6 | TLB Package File Generated by lsass.exe After a Successful Vulnerability Attack

The TCP port for packet transmission uses the dynamically allocated 492xx and 572xx bands.
For testing, src: 49287 and dest: 57219 ports were used.

If the vulnerability attack is successful, the "MsraReportDataCache32.tlb" file is transferred

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

20

and the transferred file is decompressed. The decompressed folder is saved in the same path,
Windows\SecureBootThemes\Microsoft. The name of the srv64 file is changed to "system32\
tpagentservice.dll", copied to the system and registered as a service for operation. This is the
main control module which runs the spoolsv64.exe file within the TLB package and finds
another vulnerable system to distribute the package file. Finally, the XMRig tool, in the name
of hash or hash64, for mining Monero is executed. The mining pool address is shown in Table
2-3.

The main control module decompresses the
malware package file "MsraReportDataCache32.

module and "TrustedHostServices.exe", the

Monero coin mining program. The code for the main actions of the control module is shown in
Figure 2-7.

Figure 2-7 | Code for the Major Actions of the Main Control Module

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

21

Also as shown in Table 2-4, the control module deletes all files that are presumed to be the
previous version, stop services, and deletes scheduled jobs.

("schtasks.exe"," /Delete /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Tcpip\\TcpipReportingServices\" /F");

Table 2-4 | Action of Performing File Deletion, Service Stop, and Scheduled Jobs Deletion

Also, the main control module has its own Mongoose-based web server feature with the role
of transmitting the MsraReportDataCache32.tlb package file to other infected system using
the port 26397. Also, if an external internet connection is available, the malicious package file
is downloaded from the remote server as shown in Figure 2-8.

In July 2018, 100,000 POS terminals were
hacked in South Korea. The hacking caused
most POS terminals to disconnect from the

internet and prevented normal operation of the payment service. One of the companies
which was the victim of this hacking incident posted about their service failures that occurred
due to the exploit of the Windows security vulnerability and also the recommendations for
security patches

Most of the infected terminals were running the Windows XP operating system that has
the SMB vulnerabilities and did not have the security updates applied. The threat actor
exploited this vulnerability, like the WannaCryptor ransomware, to install Gh0st RAT, which
is a backdoor malware and CoinMiner. The Figure 2-9 shows the operation process of the
malware.

Figure 2-9 | Operation Process of the POS Malware (2018.07)

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

23

The AhnLab Smart Defense (ASD) engine was used to find the iiiiiiii.exe file, the third file in
Figure 2-9 which was created by "lsass.exe", Windows system file. From this, we can deduce
that this is an attack exploiting the SMB vulnerability which was propagated by an infected
system. The malware for the remote control Gh0st RAT is "3b.txt", the second file in Figure 2-9.
The first file, "3a.txt", downloads CoinMiner, a tool for mining cryptocurrency.

Figure 2-10 | Detection of SMB Vulnerability Behaviors (2018.06 - 2018.07)

AhnLab's V3 products provide the behavior detection function against such SMB vulnerability
attacks. The report count in Figure 2-10 shows that there was a sudden rise in the attack
attempts between June 24th and July 7, 2018 which is the same period as the POS hacking
incident in Korea.

3. Analysis of the POS Attack Case 2 (2019)
In February 2019, another case of an infection that uses the CoinMiner malware to exploit the SMB
vulnerability was found targeting the South Korean POS terminals. The overall operation process
of this malware is shown in Figure 2-11 below.

ASEC REPORT Vol.94 | Security Trend

24

Figure 2-11 | Operation Process of POS Malware (2019.02)

The sample.exe file is a malware which contains two different types of 32-bit and 64-bit files to
apply depending on the operating environment. The "svchost.exe" file copied in the drive folder
in the system path (%system%drivers) performs the actual role of initiating the SMB vulnerability
attack. The last file that is downloaded and installed is the CoinMiner malware and Mimikatz, a
hacking tool for stealing the Windows account information. Unlike the POS attack of July 2018, the
interesting characteristics of the CoinMiner malware is that it is a script rather than an executable.
The detection report in Figure 2-12 shows a sudden rise in the SMB vulnerability related behaviors
from a specific period of January to February of 2019.

4. Conclusion
In 2008, a worm called Conficker started to infect many systems and continued to do so,
targeting the SMB vulnerability (MS08-067) to propagate the infection. Companies using the
SMB service are susceptible to the types of attacks, especially when they are not applied with
the recent security updates. To prevent such damage, the following security patches related
to the Microsoft Windows operating system's EternalBlue SMB vulnerability (MS17-010) must
be applied.

In view of the March 2010 NRSMiner malware attacks and the POS attacks which took
place in February and July 2018, it seems that the SMB vulnerability (MS17-010) attacks will
continue in an increasingly sophisticated way. Therefore, security inspections and updates
are important especially for the POS terminals in a vulnerable environment.
