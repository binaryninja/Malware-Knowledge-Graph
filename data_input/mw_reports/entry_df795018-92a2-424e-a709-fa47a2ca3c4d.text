Bahamut Revisited, More Cyber Espionage in the
Middle East and South Asia
October 27, 2017

By Collin Anderson (https://www.bellingcat.com/author/collinanderson/)

Introduction
In June we published on a previously unknown group
(http://bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/06/12/bahamut-pursuing-cyber-espionage-actor-middleeast/) we named “Bahamut,” a strange campaign of phishing and malware apparently focused on the
Middle East and South Asia. In the Bahamut report, we documented a capable actor interested in a
diverse set of political, economic, and non-governmental targets, which suggested espionage rather
than criminal intent. Bahamut was shown to be resourceful, not only maintaining their own Android
malware but running propaganda sites, although the quality of these activities varied noticeably.
Our publication on the campaign coincided with a series of defacements and leaked emails related to
Qatar and its neighbors, the same types of targets that arose in our research. While we have found no
evidence to link the group to these incidents, Bahamut provided a useful window into the activities
rampant in the Gulf at a time when hacking has contributed to a regional diplomatic crisis. The
incident further demonstrated the blurred lines in cybersecurity between attacks against human
rights communities and espionage against diplomats, as well as the potential role of non-state actors
in state-aligned cyber operations.
After publication, the identiﬁed operations and malware domains were taken down. For three months
there was no apparent further activity from the actor. However, in the same week of September a
series of spearphishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals,
employing the same tactics as before. Bahamut remains active, and its operations are more extensive
than ﬁrst disclosed. Our primary contribution in this update is to implicate Bahamut in what are likely
counterterrorism-motivated surveillance operations, and to further aﬀirm our belief that the group is a
hacker-for-hire operation. Toward this we document a previously unnoticed link with a campaign
targeting South Asia that was published last year. This post extends the previous publication with
recent activity and lends more evidence to our past hypotheses about the political nature of its
operations.

Overlap with Previous Campaigns

Our initial observation of the Bahamut group originated from in-the-wild attempts to deceive targets
into providing account passwords through impersonation of platform providers. After unpacking the
larger targeting of the attacks, the credential theft operations were found to cover a broad range of
interests in the Middle East, such as Turkish diplomats and Iranian political ﬁgures in the lead up to
the recent presidential election. As we noted then, these incidents stood out because they exceeded
the level of care and preparation seen in the everyday cybercrime. In our report, we also noted a
similarity to the “Operation Kingphish” (http://medium.com/amnesty-insights/operation-kingphishuncovering-a-campaign-of-cyber-attacks-against-civil-society-in-qatar-and-aa40c9e08852)
campaign published by Amnesty International earlier this year. As we wrote then, compared to
Kingphish, Bahamut “operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms of professionalism and
ambition.”
A more recent credential theft attempt provided the most credible link between the two campaigns
thus far, and bolsters our hypothesis that the operations are related. Among a ﬂurry of spearphishing
attempts associated with Bahamut in recent weeks, one fake Google message directed its target to a
unique domain (string2port[.]com) to steal login credentials. The string2port domain (registered in
May 2016) strongly reﬂects the ping2port[.]info domain (registered in September 2016) that was used
in Kingphish against Qatar-focused labor rights advocates. The ping2port domain is now pending
deletion – abandoned due to discovery – but the previously unnoticed and related string2port has
been reused. Given the similarities in tactics, administration of infrastructure, domains, and other
factors, it appears increasingly clear both campaigns against Middle Eastern diplomats and those
directed against human rights advocates are connected.
The similarities to other research is not limited to Kingphish, and includes a proliﬁc campaign in
South Asia. In our original post we noted that an expansive operation was evident from a search of
potential domains based on common pattern in domain registration and hosting behavior (an AngloEuropean name sometimes followed by a number at mail.ru, often also found in the DNS ‘Start of
Authority’ record). Here too, we ﬁnd multiple other candidate domains based on simple search
patterns, although other email providers such as Pobox.sk are now more common. While we published
a number of domain names that were clearly malicious and similar to Bahamut, we did not post the
full list out of a concern of false positives. Included in these results was a domain i3mode[.]com,
which used a Mail.ru contact email and was hosted on a network found in other Bahamut
spearphishing attempts.
Whois (i3mode[.]com):
Registrant Name: KEDRICK BROWN
Registrant Phone: +503.503226605642
Registrant Email: KEDRICK.BROWN.84@MAIL.RU

This domain appears in Kaspersky’s blog post “ (https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-usedto-attack-ﬁnancial-institutions-in-asia/76717/)InPage zero-day exploit used to attack ﬁnancial
institutions in Asia” (https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-used-to-attack-ﬁnancialinstitutions-in-asia/76717/) from November 2016. That campaign targeted ﬁnancial institutions with
malware that took advantage of a vulnerability in text processing software popular with Urdu and
Arabic speaking users. The domains in the InPage campaign match the same pattern of registration
and hosting within Bahamut. The Urdu connection recalls our identiﬁcation of Android malware
posing as a Urdu Quranic reference. This thematic overlap also includes a relevant sample “Analysis
Report on Kashmir.exe,” which would be of interest to a South Asian audience. Additionally, another

sample connecting to the i3mode domain (“E-Challan.zip”) appears to be a reference to receipt for
payment or delivery speciﬁc to India and Pakistan. The staging domain for that malware also has
another subdomain that appeared to reference an Indian business newspaper (“mint-newsportal.hymnfork.com”).
This faint connection in domains and similar interests provides a ﬁrst hint that Bahamut is more
active than we were previously aware and bolsters our hypothesis that the group is a hackers-for-hire
operation.

Malware Campaigns in South Asia
In the Bahamut report, we discussed two domains found within our search that were linked with a
custom Android malware agent. This connection between the malware and credential theft was
reinforced by some similarities in how the agent reported back to the attacker’s servers, and thus we
felt moderately conﬁdent about a link between the credential theft and the malware. After the
publication of the original report, these sites were taken oﬀline despite the fact that one agent was
even updated a six days prior to our post (the “Khuai” application). Additionally, antivirus engines
began to detect copies of this malware based on common patterns in development, including apps
that we were not aware of. Based on a search of public sources, we ﬁnd three more malicious
applications focused mostly on South Asia, including samples uploaded from India.

(https://017qndpynh-

ﬂywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/devoted.png)
Included in the newly detected apps was one named “Devoted to Humanity,” which has been taken
down from the Play Store (devoted.to.humanity). Based on the name and domains used in the
communications (“devotedtohumanity-ﬁf[.]info”, which was registered in March 2016), it appears that
the application impersonates the “Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation” (FIF) that ostensibly operates as a
religious charity primarily in Pakistan. FIF is notable for its links to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist
organization, which has committed mass-casualty attacks in India in support of establishing Pakistani
control over the disputed Jammu and Kashmir border region. As a result of its connections to LeT and
international pressure to crack down on Kashmiri jihadists, Pakistan placed FIF under on a terrorism
watch list in January 2017 (https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/222203-Pakistan-says-FIF-to-be-

retained-on-watch-list). The development of a malware agent relevant to Indian and Pakistani security
interests, timed with increased international scrutiny on FIF, suggests a counterterrorism and
intelligence motive for Bahamut’s espionage.
The “Devoted to Humanity” app also references an image hosted on domain voguextra[.]com, which
appears to have been used to stage decoy documents
(https://www.virustotal.com/#/url/a65bcd077ea0c098ae0bc88414a38f2cf4333cae40d704eb88dfa043

(https://017qndpynh-ﬂywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/10/gps.png)
The Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation app is not the only Kashmir-related campaign associated with
Bahamut. Pivoting oﬀ the unique contact information used to register the FIF domain, “adgnad
dangda” and “adgnad@mail.ru (mailto:adgnad@mail.ru)”, we also ﬁnd two more (“Android-Cloud.net”
and “Kashmir-Weather-Info.com”) that were cohosted on the same server as the FIF site. The Kashmir
Weather domain corresponds with a now-removed Android application with the similar set of
permissions and tactics found in the previous malware (com.weather.kashmir). The purpose of the
“Android-Cloud.net” domain is not currently known.
It is important to note that the domains had lapsed and were re-registered since they were ﬁrst used.
So while they appear to be malicious, the current custody is unclear. The domains now purport
(https://web.archive.org/web/20171025013449/http:/Kashmir-Weather-Info.com) to be for a
platform “Donkey Service” (“DoDoDonkey”), which provides a less than credible pitch:

Donkey Service has incredibly large network and infrastructure to stop really large attacks
on the Mobile system.
We just get clean requests and never have to deal with malicious traﬀic or attacks on the
Mobile infrastructure. We are the perfect partner for our business!

(https://017qndpynh-ﬂywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mxi.png)
As with the “Khuai” Chinese-English translator malware in the previous post, other identiﬁed agents
have unclear targets, such as the “MXI Player” that was last updated August 2017 (mxiplayer[.]com).
MXI Player appears to be a version of the Bahamut agent, designed to record the phone calls and
collect other information about the user (com.mxi.videoplay). After having been kicked oﬀ Play Store
several times, it appears that Bahamut is now hosting its agent on the APKPure alternative app store.
However, the malware retains certain design choices seen in previous attacks, for example around
encryption and communications with the attacker server. As a result, it is already ﬂagged as Bahamut
by antivirus engines.
More interestingly, the MXI Player site also includes a Windows version of the application, which is a
rebranded media player that also installs a malware agent posing as a software updater
(mxiupdate.exe). A full write up of the Windows malware is not in scope of this article for the sake of
brevity and our intended contribution. A hash for the malware agent is provided in the appendix for
those interested. A cursory inspection of debugging artifacts and other details, such as an embedded
ﬁlesystem path referring to a template code project (“EmbeddedAssembly_1.3”), suggests that the
agent is both rudimentary and custom designed.
One important trait worth noting is that the Windows malware’s communications strongly resembles
the malware connected to the domains disclosed by Kaspersky. These similarities include same
approach of communication beacons to a randomly-named path on the attacker’s server, with the

same URL parameters that contain similar types of values (probably AES encrypted strings
represented in base64, like the Android applications):
Bahamut’s Mixi Player malware (mxiplayer[.]com):
/hdhfdhﬀjvfjd/gfdhghfdjhvbd hj.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=N/A&s=[string]&t=[string]

InPageCampaign malware (encrypzi[.]com):
/fdjgwsdjgbfv/dbzkfgdkgbv b.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=0&s=[string]

These repeated parallels further indicate a relationship between the Android malware operations and
the InPage-related espionage. In review, these connections include:
Overlap between the extended network of domains relevant to Bahamut’s credential theft
infrastructure and malware domains in Kaspersky’s report;
Similarity in the format of beacons between Bahamut’s Windows agent and malware associated
with the InPage domains, and to a lesser extent even in the Android agent; and,
Commonalities in targeted interests, namely the contested Kashmir region.
One curious trait of Bahamut is that it develops fully-functional applications in support of its
espionage activities, rather than push nonfunctional fake apps or bundle malware with legitimate
software. These include translation and weather applications that involved requests to third-party
APIs and other user interactions. While much of the code appears to be copied and these applications
are simple, Bahamut must spend a fair amount of time on operations that target a small number of
individuals. The content and app market descriptions of the three Android applications also recalls our
previous observation that the Bahamut actor appears to be ﬂuent in English, albeit constrained either
due to not being native speakers or lack of professionalism.

Credential Theft in the Middle East
Bahamut has taken a more concerted eﬀort to reduce exposure of their operations, preventing the
research techniques that led to our cataloguing of their infrastructure and operations in the ﬁrst post.
Once again, the attempts all originate from less reputable hosting companies and networks
(AS44901, BelCloud Hosting Corporation). Spearphishing pages are now more resistant to
enumeration attempts and appear to use a dedicated subdomain for one speciﬁc victim. The unique
subdomain appears to be automatically disabled after the “successful” phishing attempt in order to
cover the trail of the attack (redirecting the user elsewhere or appearing to be a Google error page).
These pages have also increased their use of unicode replacements for letters and other font tricks as
a way to evade network ﬁlters or to deceive users (e.g. using r and n, “rn”, to appear like the letter “m”).
Altogether an already stealthy actor has improved their operational proﬁle.

(https://017qndpynh-ﬂywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elseif.png)
Curiously, Bahamut appears to track password attempts in response to failed phishing attempts or to
provoke the target to provide more passwords. These passwords are hardcoded in the phishing page
so that the login form will immediately return a “bad password” message if entered. This could be
designed to trick the user into providing older passwords or alternative passwords used on other
platforms to provide a foothold into other services. The result is that Bahamut spearphishing pages
include over two hundred possible real world passwords that appear to cover at least a couple of
dozen likely victims.
The theme of the passwords provide indication of the types of targets and victims of Bahamut since
our last encounter. Most of the domains clearly reﬂect a Middle Eastern audience, including referring
to individuals’ names (e.g. “al Khalifa”) and Emirati phone numbers. Some of these passwords are
cryptic – such as one referencing a supermarket in Beirut. Others reference a “national bloc,” Gaza,

the Dubai Expo in 2020, and a Saudi media entity. More generally, these targets appear to include
people or entities in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, and Bahrain, among other
Arab countries. Further demonstrating its focus on the Middle East, the phishing page speciﬁcally
(and exclusively) checks if the visitor’s browser is set to the Arabic language and redirects them to a
translated page. Where targets are personally identiﬁable, these campaigns reﬂect an intimate
understanding of the relationships and members of the policy and international relations sectors of
certain Gulf states – information that would not be readily accessible to a bystander, and targets that
would not be of interest outside of political motivations.
The recent incidents also involved a social engineering tactic well documented in the Kingphish
report: ﬁctitious social media proﬁles. In Kingphish, a proﬁle active on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook
(purporting to be an IT and business professional) approached labor rights advocates requesting help
on research about human traﬀicking.
Similarly, a ﬁctitious LinkedIn proﬁle (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-foster-65920b147/)
named “Sophie Foster” attempted to simultaneously approach multiple targets of Bahamut’s phishing
messages. The Foster proﬁle appears crafted for a professional Middle East related demographic,
claiming to have experience in public relations and international trade. Among connections to SOAS
and LSE students, which appear to be cover related to her claimed educational background, the
proﬁle has a clear theme in targets: journalists and public relations professionals in the Middle East,
including individuals at Sky News Arabia and Al-Masry Al-Youm, and others in Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi,
UAE, and Turkey. A two-year old Facebook proﬁle exists (https://www.facebook.com/people/SophieFoster/100019404465464) for the persona, which has liked pages for Lebanese politicians and has a
Mail.ru account linked to it.

(https://017qndpynh-ﬂywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sophie.png)
Bahamut spearphishing attempts have also been accompanied with SMS messages purporting to be
from Google about security issues on their account, including a class 0 message or “ﬂash text.”
(http://devlib.symbian.slions.net/s3/GUID-CBFDD753-BAE3-5C40-B947-EB8CDA11CD23.html)
These text messages did not include links but are intended to build credibility around the fake service
notiﬁcations later sent to the target’s email address. The use of fake sender identiﬁers – especially
combined with the unusual ﬂash text approach – could be eﬀective, but once again Bahamut is
betrayed by its unusual English.

Bahamut also appears to be more aggressive in reconnaissance against targets. As it harvested
potential addresses associated with targets, it would sended tailored or salacious messages with
image-based trackers to check if the message was opened. These provide a metric as to whether the

target is ignoring attacks, or whether the email address is not monitored or active. The messages
were crafted to a Middle East focused audience, primarily posing as news stories or media outlets
(e.g. Al Monitor) relevant to the region.

(https://017qndpynh-ﬂywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fakemeails.jpg)

Conclusion and Implications
Given our increased conﬁdence that Bahamut was responsible for targeting of Qatari labor rights
advocates and its focus on the foreign policy institutions other Gulf states, Bahamut’s interests are
seemingly too expansive to be limited one sponsor or customer. However, those targets fall within
coherent themes. It is unclear which single client could be interested in both a Kashmiri organization
on a terrorism watchlist and Egyptian journalists. Thus far, Bahamut’s campaigns have appeared to be
primarily espionage or information operations – not destructive attacks or fraud. The targets and
themes of Bahamut’s campaigns have consistently fallen within two regions – South Asia (primarily
Pakistan, speciﬁcally Kashmir) and the Middle East (from Morocco to Iran). The targeting of
organizations scrutinized ties to terrorism raises the stakes for the operation, and diﬀerentiate it from
usual cybercrime. Targets outside of the Middle East tend to still have associations to Middle Eastern
issues, such as a European investment ﬁrm active in a Gulf country and a foreign policy experts in the
West. We have not found evidence of Bahamut engaging in crime or operating outside its limited
geographic domains, although this narrow perspective could be accounted for by its
compartmentalization of operations.
There remains ample questions and research opportunities to be explored. While Bahamut has
leveraged resources in Urdu and Arabic, it appears to be most comfortable in the English language
despite its uncommon grammar. While we note malicious domains that maintain a similar proﬁle to
Bahamut that impersonate Qatari government email services, we have not found a direct connection
to those campaigns, and there has been little indication of the targeting of Qatar within our
monitoring. We have not fully explored the extent of Bahamut’s operations, such as its Windows
malware agent or possible other Android malware. Moreover, the networks and tactics used within
Bahamut’s operations turn up suspicious sites that resemble the Times of Arab operation disclosed
previously – often Middle East focused news published in English that recirculate content on
technology and politics with no clear attribution or purpose. These suspicious sites and those we can
account for as Bahamut repeatedly turn up a nexus with India, more so than the Middle East, despite
attempts by the attackers to stay anonymous. Once again, our investigation only seems to be a limited
window into a strange operation.
The proposition that a non-state hacker-for-hire operation could be used in pursuit of regional state
interests is not unusual. At this point most Middle Eastern governments have at least once procured
cyber espionage capabilities from abroad, such as from the government malware vendors FinFisher,
NSO and Hacking Team. By one account, Qatar even sought to outsource an oﬀensive cyber program

to American companies (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-cyberwarfareheats-up-allies-turn-to-us-companies-for-expertise/2012/11/22/a14f764c-192c-11e2-bd105ﬀ056538b7c_story.html?utm_term=.a1a5dd6c70e3) – a deal that was quashed by the U.S.
government. This reliance on contractors could indicate that such countries have been unable to
develop their own in-house capacity, which would align with their general reliance on foreign military
ﬁrms (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/world/middleeast/15prince.html). It is also worth noting
that while some government agencies may have acquired tools already, other entities such as local
police might still desire their own capabilities leading to overlaps. On the vendor side, in recent years
companies such as the Indian-ﬁrm Aglaya have been implicated in selling full hacking as a service
(https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ywvx/leaked-catalog-weaponized-informationtwitter-aglaya), rather than simply providing tools for government use. This parallels the unclear lines
between cybercrime and espionage seen elsewhere, and hints that mercenary cyber operations are
more common than currently understood. Thus Bahamut warrants attention as an emblematic case of
the interest in cyber espionage in places such as the Middle East and the range of vendors willing to
meet that demand.

Acknowledgement
We appreciate the help from Tom Lancaster, who noticed the overlap with Kaspersky’s InPage report
and an additional Android malware agent. Our prior publication also failed to acknowledge immensely
valuable input from a number of colleagues, including Nadim Kobeissi’s feedback on how the API
endpoints on the Android malware were encrypted. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this
research and provided feedback.
