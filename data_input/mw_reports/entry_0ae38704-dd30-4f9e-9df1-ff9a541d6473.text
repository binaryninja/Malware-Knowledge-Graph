New zero-day used for effective kernel memory injection and stealth
Earlier this year, during a security sweep, Kaspersky Lab detected a cyber-intrusion affecting
several of our internal systems.
Following this finding, we launched a large scale investigation, which led to the discovery of
a new malware platform from one of the most skilled, mysterious and powerful groups in the
APT world – Duqu. The Duqu threat actor went dark in 2012 and was believed to have
stopped working on this project – until now. Our technical analysis indicates the new round of
attacks include an updated version of the infamous 2011 Duqu malware, sometimes referred
to as the stepbrother of Stuxnet. We named this new malware and its associated platform
“Duqu 2.0”.
Some of the new 2014-2015 Duqu infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues
related to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor behind Duqu
appears to have launched attacks at the venues for some of these high level talks. In
addition to the P5+1 events, the Duqu 2.0 group has launched a similar attack in relation to
the 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.

In the case of Kaspersky Lab, the attack took advantage of a zero-day in the Windows
Kernel, and possibly up to two other, currently patched vulnerabilities, which were zero-day
at that time. The analysis of the attack revealed that the main goal of the attackers was to
spy on Kaspersky Lab technologies, ongoing research and internal processes. No
interference with processes or systems was detected. More details can be found in our
technical paper.
From a threat actor point of view, the decision to target a world-class security company must
be quite difficult. On one hand, it almost surely means the attack will be exposed – it’s very
unlikely that the attack will go unnoticed. So the targeting of security companies indicates
that either they are very confident they won’t get caught, or perhaps they don’t care much if
they are discovered and exposed. By targeting Kaspersky Lab, the Duqu attackers probably
took a huge bet hoping they’d remain undiscovered; and lost.
At Kaspersky Lab, we strongly believe in transparency, which is why we are going public with
this information. Kaspersky Lab is confident that its clients and partners are safe and that
there is no impact on the company’s products, technologies and services.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
8/10

It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
