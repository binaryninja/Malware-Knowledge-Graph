PseudoManuscrypt Being Distributed in the Same
Method as Cryptbot

February 18, 2022

The ASEC analysis team has discovered that PseudoManuscrypt malware was being
distributed in Korea since May 2021. Introduced in the previous ASEC blog,
PseudoManuscrypt is disguised as an installer that is similar to a form of Cryptbot, and is
being distributed. Not only is its file form similar to Cryptbot, but it is also distributed via
malicious sites exposed on the top search page when users search commercial softwarerelated illegal programs such as Crack and Keygen.
The team has confirmed the executable file path below in the logs collected by AhnLab’s
ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense) infrastructure, and it appears that the user was trying to
download a Windows validation program from a malicious site.
Executable File Path

Log Detection Graph
Such a distribution method targets random users, and it has been confirmed that numerous
PCs in Korea were infected. The figure above is a graph of the number of logs that were
detected since the start of distribution (May 2021) up till now. The green graph shows the
number of infected PCs, and the red graph shows the number of detected files. You can see
that on average, around 30 PCs were consistently being infected every day.

PseudoManuscrypt operation flow
The top-level file disguised as an illegal program is in the form of NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System) Installer, and it creates the “setup_installer.exe” file to execute it.
“Setup_installer.exe” is in the form of 7z SFX, and it creates a Loader file, various malware,
and numerous dll files. The dll files are all normal files, and they are libraries needed to
execute the Loader file. Loader executes the various malware that was created together, and
this process is the same as the execution process of Cryptbot. Other than
PseudoManuscrypt, malware executed by Loader includes SmokeLoader, Glupteba, etc.,
and PseudoManuscrypt is in the form of 7z SFX. Finally, PseudoManuscrypt creates
install.dll (Loader that performs decoding) and install.dat (Encoded shellcode) in the
%TEMP% path. It then creates and executes a shortcut file called “install.dll.lnk” to operate a
certain function inside the install.dll file.

Property of install.dll.lnk
C:\Windows\system32\rUNdlL32.eXe “%TEMP%\install.dll”,install

PseudoManuscrypt execution flow (2)
The install.dll file decodes the install.dat file to execute it in the memory. The install.dat file
contains a shellcode and pe data that is encoded and compressed, and the shellcode
decodes the encoded and compressed pe data and executes it. The pe data then performs
the actual malicious behavior and decodes additional data inside to create it with the tmp
extension, which is then registered to service. Details about pe data are explained below.

3/9

Command line scan

The called pe data first checks if the name of the currently running process is svchost.exe. In
this case, the current process was run as rundll32.exe by the shortcut file.

MachineGuid value
When it is not a svchost.exe process, it creates a certain registry key and saves malicious
data. For the name of the created registry, it uses the MachineGuid value that exists in the
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsfot\Cryptography registry. MachineGuid is a HardwareID value,
where each PC has a unique value. It uses this characteristic to create the registry key
name.

4/9

MachineGuid value is encoded via the “Global” string, and the encoded MachineGuid value
is used to create a registry key in the path below. The encoded “install.dat” data is then
saved to the registry key.
– HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\MachineGuid(“Global”):1 – Encoded “install.dat”

Running service scan
After it creates the registry key, it checks the process id of services that include “-k netsvcs”
in their arguments, then injects the decoded “install.dat” in the process. It then deletes the
“install.dat” file that exists in the %TEMP% path, and the injected process references the
encoded “install.dat” data that was saved to the registry key.
The injected svchost.exe goes through the same process and scans the command line. It
checks if the name of the current process is svchost.exe and if netsvcs is included in the
argument, it executes two threads.

5/9

The threat that is first executed performs the feature of registering a certain file to service
when the process is terminated. It first brings down the priority of process termination to the
lowest and configures the control handler.

Control handler function

The function that is added to the control handler is as shown above, and it checks the
received control signals. The function scans for the following control signal values: 5 and 6. If
the signal value is 5 (When the user logs off), it reconfigures the priority of process
termination and the control handler, and if the signal value is 6 (When the system shuts
down), it executes a function that creates a malicious service. The malicious service is
created via the process below.
After creating the SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppService[a-z] registry, it
configures this service registry as shown below.
– Start : 0x02 (Starts automatically when the system starts)
– imagepath : %SystemRoot%\System32\svchostexe -k AppService
The name of the created service and the file that is executed via the service are configured
as follows:
– SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\ServicesAppService[a-z]\\Parameters:servicedll =
%System%\Encoded string.tmp
– SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost:AppService
=AppService[a-z]

6/9

Created service
The file that is to be registered to the service decodes the data that exists in a certain
location and creates it with the tmp extension in the System path. The created tmp file acts
as a Loader that decodes and executes the encoded “install.dat” data existing in a certain
registry key. It appears that this process serves the purpose of performing continuous
malicious behaviors even when the user PC is shut down and restarted.

Adding an exclusion to Windows Defender
After the service is created, the System folder is excluded from Windows Defender scans,
and the first thread is terminated.

Creating process

7/9

The second thread that is executed is the %System%\svchost.exe -k SystemNetworkService
command, which performs the function of creating a process and injecting the decoded
“install.dat” data.
The injected svchost.exe goes through the same process to scan the command line, and if
it’s svchost.exe run by the SystemNetworkService argument, it performs the actual malicious
behavior. It steals various user credentials including the data below via this process and
sends them to the attacker’s server.
VPN connection information
Clipboard data
Audio data
List of shared network folders
Information of processes that accept TCP and UDP ports
File version information of the running process
C2 : email.yg9[.]me
In addition to the malicious features above, it can also access the C2 server under the
attacker’s command and perform various malicious behaviors such as file download, screen
capture, and execution of keylogger and cmd commands.
As this malware is disguised as an illegal software installer and is distributed to random
individuals via malicious sites, users must be careful not to download relevant programs. As
malicious files can also be registered to service and perform continuous malicious behaviors
without the user knowing, periodic PC maintenance is necessary.
