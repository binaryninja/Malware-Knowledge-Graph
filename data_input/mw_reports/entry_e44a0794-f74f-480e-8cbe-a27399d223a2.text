Sophisticated Android Malware Strikes Users in Thailand, Philippines, and
Peru
Cyble Research & Intelligence Labs (CRIL) discovered a phishing website, hxxp://lionaiothai[.]com, that
was impersonating the genuine Thai Airline – Thai Lion Air, and tricking victims into downloading a
malicious application.
The downloaded malicious application is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which receives commands from
the Command and Control (C&C) server and performs various actions. The RAT has advanced features
such as screen recording and abusing the Accessibility Service to steal banking credentials.
During our investigation of the RAT, we discovered that the certificate used to sign this malicious
application was found in more than 50 similar malicious samples that use the same source code. These
samples posed as government agencies, shopping apps, and banking loan applications from Thailand,
the Philippines, and Peru.

Since the discovered RAT is a new and unknown variant, we will refer to it as “Gigabud” due to the
consistency of the certificate issuer name across all identified malicious applications.
The Gigabud RAT malware has been specifically targeting individuals in Thailand since July 2022, and its
spread has been increasing each month to other countries. Despite the growing number of known
samples, no antivirus software detected this malware at the time of writing this blog, suggesting that the
Threat Actor (TA) behind the RAT successfully stayed under the radar.

Additionally, in July 2022, the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) Thailand issued a warning
against the phishing site impersonating the DSI website and spreading the same Android RAT. Later in
September 2022, the Thailand Telecommunication Sector Cert (TTC-Cert) discovered the malware
“Revenue.apk” associated with the same campaign and issued a technical advisory on its behavior.
After the discovery of the Gigabud RAT by TTC-Cert in September, we observed that the TA began
distributing the malware in various countries, such as Peru and the Philippines. The malware disguises
itself using the icons of government agencies from these countries to trick victims into giving away
sensitive information.

The below figure shows the different icons used by Gigabud RAT.

These malicious applications impersonate below entities:
1. Banco de Comercio – A Peruvian Bank
2. Advice – A IT company from Thailand
3. Thai Lion Air – Thailand Airline
4. Shopee Thailand
5. SUNAT – An organization from Peru
6. DSI – Department of Special Investigation Thailand
7. BIR – Bureau of Internal Revenue Philippine
8. Kasikornbank Thailand
In this analysis, we will look at the sample “BANCO DE COMERCIO.apk”
(a940c9c54ff69dacc6771f1ffb3c91ea05f7f08e6aaf46e9802e42f948dfdb66) which is impersonating a
medium-scale Peruvian Bank and stealing sensitive information by offering the fake loan service. The indepth analysis of this malicious sample can be found in the technical analysis section.

Once installed, the malware displays a login screen that prompts users to enter their mobile number and
password. The login screen is designed to mimic the user interface of a legitimate bank and uses an icon
to deceive the victim into thinking the application is genuine.

The malware sends the entered mobile number and password to the C&C server hxxp://bweri6[.]cc and
receives the response code 400 with an error message, as shown in the below figure.

Figure 6 – Malware sending the entered mobile number to the C&C server
TA behind the Gigabud has implemented a server-side verification process to ensure the mobile number
entered during registration is legitimate and to limit malicious activity for invalid users. It could be the
reason for the delayed detection of the malware.

Figure 7 – Malware has a server-side check to validate the mobile number
During registration, the malware prompts the victim to provide their name and ID number and also allows
them to select a bank name from a list received from the Command-and-Control server with the
cardholder’s name and number.

Figure 8 – Malware prompting for card details during the registration process
Once the victim successfully logs in or registers to the malicious app, Gigabud begins gathering
information about the installed applications on the device and then runs a service called “OpenService,”
which connects to the Command-and-Control server to receive commands, as illustrated in the figure
below.

Figure 9 – Malware collecting installed application list
Once the registration or login is complete, the malware displays a fake loan contract received from the
server and then prompts the victim to confirm their information.
It also shows a withdrawal activity, as depicted in the figure below.

Figure 10 – Fake loan approval process by malware
Malware does not show any malicious activity until the final stage, where it presents a “Real Name
Authentication” page and prompts the victim to press a “click to activate” button to apply for a loan. Once
the button is clicked, the malware requests the victim to grant accessibility permissions, including
permission for screen recording and screen overlay.

After the victim grants the accessibility permission, the malware starts exploiting it by automatically
enabling the screen recording feature. Additionally, the malware requests permission to display over other
apps.

Figure 12 – Malware abusing Accessibility service to start screen recording feature
Gigabud uses WebSocket connections to send the recorded screen content to a server
hxxp://8.219.85[.]91:8888/push-streaming?id=1234.
The malware sends the recorded content every second through the WebSocket connection, as shown in
the figure.

Figure 13 – Malware sending screen recording content using WebSocket connection
The malware connects to the C&C server hxxp://bweri6[.]cc/x/command?
token=&width=1080&height=1920 to receive commands and executes various actions such as creating a
floating window service, receiving targeted bank details, sending text messages from the infected device,
opening targeted application and many other.

Figure 14 – Malware processing commands received from the C&C server
The malware receives the “bankName”, “bankImg” and “bank_id” along with action code “15” from the
C&C server. The “bankName” is the name of the targeted banking application whose credentials the
malware will steal. Upon receiving this command, the malware displays a fake dialog box using the
“bankName” and “bankImg” received from the server on top of the targeted banking application and
prompts the victim to enter their password.

The entered password by the victim will be sent to the server using the retrofit object.
The below figure shows the endpoints and the stolen data sent to the server.

The malware receives the mobile number, the message text, and the action code “5” from the C&C server
to send the text message from an infected device.

Figure 17 – Malware sending text messages from an infected device
The malware also receives the server’s bank card number and action code “29” and sets it to the
clipboard. We suspect that the bank card number could be the TA’s account or card number, which can be
used to perform on-device fraud.

Conclusion
Our analysis indicates that the Threat Actor has been actively running the campaign since July 2022,
mainly targeting victims in Thailand. Later, the campaign expanded to target victims in other countries like
Peru and the Philippines. The malware specifically targets genuine victims and conceals its malicious
activity from invalid victims. The TA has employed a unique technique to evade detection and sustain the
campaign for an extended period.
We also noticed that the Gigabud RAT utilizes screen recording as a primary method for gathering
sensitive information instead of using HTML overlay attacks. It also abuses the Accessibility service, like
other banking trojans.
The Threat Actor behind the Gigabud is continuously developing new variants of the malware intending to
target different countries. New malware variants will likely be discovered in the future, featuring new
targets and capabilities.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App
Store.
