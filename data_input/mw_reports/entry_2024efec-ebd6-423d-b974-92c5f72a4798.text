Last week, I reported 80 apps belonging to a premium SMS scam campaign, which signs
victims up for expensive premium SMS services that earn a bad actor or actors money while
ultimately leaving victims completely empty-handed, to Google’s Security Team. This led to
their swift removal from the Google Play Store. The apps that I discovered are part of the
UltimaSMS campaign, consisting of 151 apps that at one point or another had been available
for download on the Google Play Store. These apps have been downloaded more than 10.5
million times, and are nearly identical in structure and functionality; essentially copies of the
same fake app used to spread the premium SMS scam campaign. This leads me to believe
that one bad actor or group is behind the entire campaign. I have dubbed the campaign
“UltimaSMS”, because one of the first apps I discovered was called Ultima Keyboard 3D
Pro.
The fake apps I found feature a wide range of categories such as custom keyboards, QR
code scanners, video and photo editors, spam call blockers, camera filters, and games,
among others. UltimaSMS appears to be a global campaign, as according to insights from
Sensor Tower, a mobile apps marketing intelligence and insights company, the apps have
been downloaded by users from over 80 countries. The apps have been most downloaded
by users in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, followed by users in the

US and Poland. Avast has traced the earliest UltimaSMS samples to May 2021 and new
samples from the campaign were released earlier this month, meaning that the scam is still
ongoing.

The above table shows the top 10 countries where the apps have been downloaded,
according to Sensor Tower

How UltimaSMS scams users
When a user installs one of the apps, the app checks their location, International Mobile
Equipment Identity (IMEI), and phone number to determine which country area code and
language to use for the scam. Once the user opens the app, a screen, localized in the
language their device is set to, prompts them to enter their phone number, and in some
cases, email address to gain access to the app’s advertised purpose.

Some of the many prompts that users can encounter upon opening the apps. They differ
based on the country and are localized. Not all of them include fine print warning users’ of
the potential charges.
Upon entering the requested details, the user is subscribed to premium SMS services that
can charge upwards of $40 per month depending on the country and mobile carrier. Instead
of unlocking the apps’ advertised features, which users might assume should happen, the
apps will either display further SMS subscriptions options or stop working altogether. The
sole purpose of the fake apps is to deceive users into signing up for premium SMS
subscriptions. While some of the apps include fine print describing this to users, not all of
them do, meaning many people who submitted their phone numbers into the apps might not
even realize the extra charges to their phone bill are connected to the apps.

After entering a phone number and/or email address, the apps will continue to display further
SMS subscriptions or stop working altogether
Once subscribed, the premium SMS are charged weekly and, from what I can tell, appear to
be the maximum possible amount that can be charged in the country the user is from. Many
countries limit the amount of premium SMS charges that can occur within a week. The user
may be notified by their carrier of the excessive charges, but they could also go unnoticed for
weeks or months. Affected users may dismiss the apps as nonfunctional and uninstall them,
however, the SMS charges will continue and could amount up to an unpleasant sum.

UltimaSMS on the Play Store
The apps discovered are essentially identical in structure, meaning the same base app
structure is repurposed numerous times. These copies are disguised as genuine apps
through well constructed app profiles on the Play Store. The profiles feature catchy photos
and enticing app descriptions alongside often high review averages. However, upon closer
inspection, they have generic privacy policy statements and feature basic developer profiles
including generic email addresses. They also tend to have numerous negative reviews from
users that correctly identified the apps as scams or have fallen for the scam.

Users often correctly recognize the scam apps in reviews
UltimaSMS has been propagated through advertising channels on popular social media sites
such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, as seen with other recent scams and cases of
adware. There are numerous catchy video advertisements targeting users on these social
media platforms. It speaks to the size and impact of this particular strain of scam apps, as
the malicious actors are spending funds to boost downloads. Premium SMS scams are
increasingly prevalent as evidenced by Zimperium’s reporting of GriftHorse, for example. In
fact, these types of scams are not new at all, they appear to just be making a comeback.
Years ago there were malware families that would secretly use dial-up modems to dial-up
premium services, racking up thousands of dollars in charges.

How to avoid UltimaSMS and similar scams

6/8

Remain vigilant when downloading new apps, especially apps advertised in
short and catchy videos. Children may be particularly vulnerable to this type of
scam.

Disable premium SMS option with your carrier. While there are legitimate
uses for premium SMS, such as donating to charities, it is an easy avenue for
malicious actors to abuse. Disabling this option will nullify the UltimaSMS scam.
Based on some of the user accounts that left negative reviews, it looks like
children are among the victims, making this step especially important on
children’s phones, as they may be more susceptible to this type of scam.

Carefully check reviews. Scam apps often have boosted review averages, but
written reviews may reveal the true purpose of an app. Checking the developer’s
history and profile may also be useful.

Don’t enter a phone number unless you trust the app. Being careful with
personal details, including phone number and email, goes a long way to avoiding
similar scams.

Read the fine print before entering details. Legitimate apps will have Terms of
Service and a Privacy policy alongside a statement of how they intend to use
your data and entered details.

Be cautious when you find more than one app with the same name.
Malicious apps can sometimes use the name and image of existing real and safe
apps. In this scenario, a malicious app was found to be masquerading as
Truecaller, a caller ID and spam blocking app by True Software Scandinavia AB
used by over 290 million people.

Stick to official app stores when downloading apps. Although these apps were
available on the Google Play Store, they have been removed by Google’s
security team, but they are still available for download elsewhere on the internet.
