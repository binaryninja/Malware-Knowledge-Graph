Gh0st RAT, a decades-old open-source remote administration tool (RAT), recently appeared
in phishing campaigns targeting a healthcare organization. Gh0st Remote Administration
Tool was created by a Chinese hacking group named C. Rufus Security Team that released it
publicly in 2008. The public release of Gh0st RAT source code made it easy for threat actors
to obtain and tailor the tool to their needs. Its feature set expanded over the years to include
various surveillance, persistence, and information-stealing capabilities:
Taking full control of the infected machine
Recording keystrokes in real time with offline logging available
Accessing live web cam feeds including microphone recording
Downloading files remotely
Remote shutdown and reboot
Disabling user input
Over Gh0st RAT’s long life, Chinese nation-state threat actors have used it to breach highvalue targets such as governments, embassies, economic targets, and media. One such
breach was the operation known as “GhostNet” in 2009, in which a large-scale cyber-attack
used Gh0st RAT to conduct surveillance and espionage. The breach impacted the Dalai
Lama’s Tibetan exile centers in multiple countries.
Although Gh0st RAT was first identified in reports of threat activity almost 15 years ago, it is
still actively distributed today. Cofense Intelligence identified an email targeting a Europeanowned medical technology organization located in China, attempting to deliver Gh0st RAT
via an embedded link. The embedded link that hosted the malware was affiliated with
Tencent and based in Hong Kong. The sample’s command and control (C2) server is also
located on the CHINANET Jiangsu province network in the city of Nanjing.

Although Ghost RAT has a history of use by nation-state threat actors, Cofense Intelligence
does not have conclusive evidence that this recent campaign is associated with known
nation-state activity. The activity we observed activity shares certain characteristics with
some advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including APT27, which is known for
intellectual property theft against healthcare and technology companies, and is also known
for the use of Gh0st RAT. However, since Gh0st RAT’s source code is publicly available, it
remains plausible that any threat actor could download and modify the code for their own
needs. With Chinese universities (including more than one in Nanjing) being heavily involved
in training talent for the Chinese defense industry, it is also plausible that students or other
threat actors that are at times associated with APT groups may be carrying out independent
threat activity using tools they are familiar with.
