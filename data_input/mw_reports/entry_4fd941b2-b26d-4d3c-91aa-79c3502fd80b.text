MULTIGRAIN – Point of Sale Attackers Make an
Unhealthy Addition to the Pantry
fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/04/multigrain_pointo.html

FireEye recently discovered a new variant of a point of sale (POS) malware family known as
NewPosThings. This variant, which we call “MULTIGRAIN”, consists largely of a subset of
slightly modified code from NewPosThings. The variant is highly targeted, digitally signed,
and exfiltrates stolen payment card data over DNS. The addition of DNS-based exfiltration is
new for this malware family; however, other POS malware families such as BernhardPOS
and FrameworkPOS have used this technique in the past.
Using DNS for data exfiltration provides several advantages to the attacker. Sensitive
environments that process card data will often monitor, restrict, or entirely block the HTTP or
FTP traffic often used for exfiltration in other environments. While these common internet
protocols may be disabled within a restrictive card processing environment, DNS is still
necessary to resolve hostnames within the corporate environment and is unlikely to be
blocked.
Specific Targeting

Several POS malware families will parse through running processes and scrape a large
number of them in the hopes of locating card data. In contrast to that approach,
MULTIGRAIN has been custom-engineered to target a specific point of sale process:

multi.exe, associated with a popular back-end card authorization and POS (electronic draft
capture) server software package. If multi.exe is not found on the infected host, the malware
will not install and will simply delete itself. This shows that while developing or building their
malware, the attackers had a very specific knowledge of the target environment and knew
this process would be running.
Persistence

If the targeted POS process is running on the host and the malware is executed with a
command line parameter designating “installation mode”, MULTIGRAIN copies itself to the
hardcoded location “c:\windows\wme.exe” and installs a service with the properties shown in
Figure 1.

Initial Beaconing

The malware collects the volume serial number and part of the MAC address and creates a
hash of the concatenated value using the DJB2 hashing algorithm. The resulting hash is then
combined with the computer name and a version number and all three components are then
encoded with a custom Base32 encoding algorithm. The malware then makes a DNS query
with this information to a hardcoded domain, notifying the attacker of a successful
installation. The process is shown in Figure 2.

Memory-Scraping and Card Data Exfiltration

Once installed and executing, MULTIGRAIN begins scraping the memory of the targeted
process for Track 2 card data, validating that data using the Luhn algorithm. Track 2 data will
normally contain the PAN (Primary Account Number), Expiration Date, Service Code and
optionally a CVV/CVC number, data which will typically be sufficient in most scenarios to
attempt “card-present” and, and in some cases, “card-not-present” fraud.
Each Track 2 record is first encrypted with a 1024-bit RSA public key, pushed through the
same custom Base32 encoding process as used in the installation beacon, and then stored
in a buffer. Every five minutes, the malware checks this buffer to see if any card data is ready
for exfiltration. If card data is present, the individual encrypted and encoded Track 2 data
record for each card is sent over the network by means of a DNS query made by the
malware. The process is shown in Figure 3.

Base32 Encoding

Both the installation beacon and the stolen card data are encoded with an unusual encoding
algorithm – Base32 – before being transmitted via DNS queries. The choice of Base32 is
interesting as Base64 is better known and more widely used (for instance in the MIME
standard used by email attachments). Using Base32 will actually result in the data taking up
20 percent more space than Base64, so the attackers were unconcerned with the efficiency
of bandwidth.
One possible reason for selecting Base32 is the relative obscurity of the algorithm. Security
and data loss prevention (DLP) products are more likely to detect Base64 encoding and in
some cases can automatically decode the data, which could result in DLP devices identifying
the exfiltration.
Code Reuse

Elements of the code from MULTIGRAIN show strong similarities to the POS malware family
known as NewPosThings. Shared code elements include:
The code used to scrape a process for card data
The DJB2 hashing algorithm used as part of creating a system ID

Two other examples from binary disassembly are shown below: the “connect/3” network
beacon (Figure 4 – seemingly unused in MULTIGRAIN) and similarities in the construction of
the installation beacon (Figure 5).

Digital Signature

As shown in Figure 6, this MULTIGRAIN sample is digitally signed with a certificate issued to
the “AMO-K Limited Liability Company” with a Comodo root and intermediate certificate
chain (serial number d0 8d 83 ff 11 8d f3 77 7e 37 1c 5c 48 2c ce 7b). The certificate was
revoked on Oct. 14, 2015.

Conclusion

Organizations that process card data must remain vigilant against attackers intent on
financial fraud. Many POS malware families are written to be fairly generic (for example,
targeting any process that may contain payment card data). However, threat actors may
operate with greater stealth, customizing malware for specific environments and using less
common protocols or methods for data exfiltration.
Although MULTIGRAIN does not bring any new capabilities to the POS malware table, it
does show that capable attackers can customize malware “on-the-fly” to target a specific
environment. While exfiltration via DNS is not a new tactic, MULTIGRAIN demonstrates that
organizations should monitor and review DNS traffic for suspicious or anomalous behavior.
