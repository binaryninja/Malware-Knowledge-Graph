New Findings From Our Investigation of SUNBURST
orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/
January 11, 2021

Since the cyberattack on our customers and SolarWinds, we have been working around the
clock to support our customers. As we shared in our recent update, we are partnering with
multiple industry-leading cybersecurity experts to strengthen our systems, further enhance
our product development processes, and adapt the ways that we deliver powerful,
affordable, and secure solutions to our customers. We are working with our counsel, DLA
Piper, CrowdStrike, KPMG, and other industry experts to perform our root cause analysis of
the attack. As part of that analysis, we are examining how the SUNBURST malicious code
was inserted into our Orion Platform software and once inserted, how the code operated and
remained undetected. Today we are providing an update on the investigation thus far and an
important development we believe brings us closer to understanding how this serious attack
was carried out. We believe we have found a highly sophisticated and novel malicious code
injection source the perpetrators used to insert the SUNBURST malicious code into builds of
our Orion Platform software. We recognize the software development and build process used
by SolarWinds is common throughout the software industry, so we believe that sharing this
information openly will help the industry guard against similar attacks in the future and create
safer environments for customers. The security of our customers and our commitment to
transparency continue to guide our work in these areas and going forward. Highly
sophisticated and complex malware designed to circumvent threat detection As we
and industry experts have noted previously, the SUNBURST attack appears to be one of the
most complex and sophisticated cyberattacks in history. The U.S. government and many
1/5

private-sector experts have stated the belief that a foreign nation-state conducted this
intrusive operation as part of a widespread attack against America’s cyberinfrastructure. To
date, our investigations have not independently verified the identity of the perpetrators.
Analysis suggests that by managing the intrusion through multiple servers based in the
United States and mimicking legitimate network traffic, the attackers were able to circumvent
threat detection techniques employed by both SolarWinds, other private companies, and the
federal government. The SUNBURST malicious code itself appears to have been designed
to provide the perpetrators a way to enter a customer’s IT environment. If exploited, the
perpetrators then had to avoid firewalls and other security controls within the customer’s
environment. KPMG and CrowdStrike, working together with the SolarWinds team, have
been able to locate the malicious code injection source. We have reverse-engineered the
code responsible for the attack, enabling us to learn more about the tool that was developed
and deployed into the build environment. This highly sophisticated and novel code was
designed to inject the SUNBURST malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion Platform
without arousing the suspicion of our software development and build teams. We encourage
everyone to visit this blog post, authored by the CrowdStrike team, which provides additional
details into these findings and other technical aspects of this attack, and contains valuable
information intended to help the industry better understand attacks of this nature. As we
discussed in our previous post, we hope that this event ushers in a new level of collaboration
and information sharing within the technology industry to address and prevent similar attacks
in the future. Our concern is that right now similar processes may exist in software
development environments at other companies throughout the world. The severity and
complexity of this attack has taught us that more effectively combatting similar attacks in the
future will require an industry-wide approach as well as public-private partnerships that
leverage the skills, insight, knowledge, and resources of all constituents. We want to be a
part of that solution, which is why we are sharing this information with the broader
community, and we will continue to share progress as we assimilate this information into our
go-forward practices. Our investigations to date We are actively working with law
enforcement, the intelligence community, governments, and industry colleagues in our and
their investigations. As we recently disclosed, we even shared all of our proprietary code
libraries that we believed to have been affected by SUNBURST to give security professionals
the information they needed in their research.

Our current timeline for this incident begins in September 2019, which is the earliest
suspicious activity on our internal systems identified by our forensic teams in the
course of their current investigations.
The subsequent October 2019 version of the Orion Platform release appears to have
contained modifications designed to test the perpetrators’ ability to insert code into our
builds
An updated version of the malicious code injection source that inserted the
SUNBURST malicious code into Orion Platform releases starting on February 20,
2020.
The perpetrators remained undetected and removed the SUNBURST malicious code
from our environment in June 2020. During that time, through to today, SolarWinds
investigated various vulnerabilities in its Orion Platform. It remediated or initiated the
process of remediating vulnerabilities, a regular process that continues today. However,
until December 2020, the company did not identify any vulnerabilities as what we now
know as SUNBURST.
On December 12, 2020, we were informed of the cyberattack and moved swiftly to
notify and protect our customers and to investigate the attack in collaboration law
enforcement, intelligence and governments.
As part of our ongoing efforts to protect our customers and investigate the SUNBURST
attack, we are reviewing historical and current customer inquiries that might contribute to a
better understanding of the attack. To date, we have identified two previous customer
support incidents during the timeline referenced above that, with the benefit of hindsight, we
believe may be related to SUNBURST. We investigated the first in conjunction with our
customer and two third-party security companies. At that time, we did not determine the root
3/5

cause of the suspicious activity or identify the presence of the SUNBURST malicious code
within our Orion Platform software. The second incident occurred in November, and similarly,
we did not identify the presence of the SUNBURST malicious code. We are still investigating
these incidents and are sharing information related to them with law enforcement to support
investigation efforts. We will continue our investigations to help ensure our products and
internal systems are secure and to provide information that we hope leads to the
identification of the perpetrators and the prevention of these types of attacks in the future.
We also plan to continue to share our broader findings with the industry at large in the hope
that everyone is better able protect themselves and deliver more secure solutions to their
customers. ********************************************************************************* This Blog
