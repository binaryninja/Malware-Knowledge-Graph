Latest Version of Android Banking Trojan Targets over 400 Applications
Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post wherein a researcher mentioned the distribution of
ERMAC 2.0. ERMAC is an Android Banking Trojan that was first discovered in late August 2021, when it
was found targeting Poland. ERMAC 1.0 was capable of stealing the credentials of 378 applications. The
Threat Actor was renting it out for $3K/month on a cybercrime forum.
Recently, Cyble Research Labs observed that an upgraded version – ERMAC 2.0 – has been available on
underground forums for rent at $5K/month and targets 467 applications for stealing credentials.

We have observed that the ERMAC 2.0 is being delivered through fake sites. For example, via the Bolt
Food site – a delivery platform that provides high-quality food delivery services. The fake app
impersonates the Bolt Food Android application and targets Polish Bolt Food users.

Apart from the fake Bolt Food site, EMRAC 2.0 spreads through fake browser update sites, as shown in
Figure 3.

Manifest Description
The malicious application asks for 43 permissions, of which the TA exploits 12. The malware’s harmful
permission requests are listed below:
Permission

through the Dialer user interface for the user to confirm the call

READ_SMS

Allows an application to read SMS messages

SEND_SMS

Allows an application to send SMS

READ_CONTACTS

Allows an application to read the user’s

contacts data

READ_PHONE_STATE

apps.

Source Code Review
Apart from the application’s subclass, the rest of the components identified from the Manifest file are
missing. We can thus infer that the application is packed.

Figure 6 – Manifest File
Upon execution, the malicious application unpacks the DEX file present in the assets folder and then loads
the classes.
In this case, the dropped dex file name is “pqiRsn.json,” which has all the missing classes
The strings present in the classes are encoded using base64 and encrypted using the AES-128-bit
algorithm.
The Secret Key and IVparameter were dumped during dynamic analysis. Both Secret Key and
IVparameter are used to decrypt hardcoded strings present in the file as well as encrypt the data sent to
the C&C server. The below image explains the decryption process.

Figure 7 – Encryption and Decryption Technique
On installing the application, it prompts the user to turn on the Accessibility Service. When the victim
grants this permission, it starts abusing services by auto-enabling overlay activity and auto-granting
permissions.

5/11

Figure 8 – Accessibility Service
After granting the Accessibility permission, the malware sends a list of installed applications on the victim’s
Android device to the C&C server. The malware then downloads and installs the injection modules of
targeted applications based on this application list.
Figure 9 showcases the C&C communications from the victim’s device, which sends the details of installed
applications and receives a response, including a list of targeted applications to perform overlay activity. At
the time of our analysis, it was observed that the “Unocoin” wallet was the targeted application by the
attacker.

The malware then receives an encrypted HTML phishing page, which will be decrypted and stored into the
Shared Preference file named “setting.xml” with the action status, as shown in the figure below.

Figure 10 – Downloaded injection saved in Shared Preference file
As soon as the victim interacts with a targeted genuine application, the injected phishing page is displayed
through setting.xml that can be used for credential harvesting.
Figure 11 shows the phishing page for “Unocoin.” The malware sends the start_inject command to the
C&C server before sending the credentials.

Figure 11 – Loading phishing page
The harvested credentials are sent to the same C&C server in the encrypted format, as shown in Figure
12. ERMAC 2.0 uses the command logs for code injection as well as data exfiltration functionalities.

The TA can then use these credentials to steal cryptocurrency from the victim’s account.
The below image shows the TA’s phishing pages used to trick the victims into falling for a phishing scheme
while attempting to access genuine applications.

Figure 13 – Fake injected window targeting different applications
Cyble Research Labs witnessed that the malware has functionalities to target various banking applications
of several banks worldwide.
The commands used by ERMAC 2.0 to execute malicious operations are:
Command

Description

downloadingInjections

Sends the application list to download injections

logs

Sends injection logs to the server

checkAP

Check the application status and send it to the server

registration

Sends device data

updateBotParams

Sends the updated bot parameters

downloadInjection

Used to receive the phishing HTML page

Conclusion

8/11

The Threat Actor behind ERMAC used the leaked code from a well-known malware variant named
“Cerberus” and modified the code to sell the Android botnets in cybercrime forums. Interestingly, we
observed that ERMAC 2.0 is distributed rapidly through various phishing sites, primarily targeting Polish
users.
ERMAC 2.0 steals credentials from different crypto wallets and targets multiple banking applications
worldwide. We foresee that the TA behind ERMAC 2.0 will continue to develop new versions with more
targeted applications, new TTPs, and new delivery methods.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

How to prevent malware infection?
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App
Store.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as
PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile
device where possible.
Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Be careful while enabling any permissions.
Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.

How to identify whether you are infected?
Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices.
Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions
accordingly.

What to do when you are infected?
Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the
Mobile Data.
Perform a factory reset.
Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.
Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.

What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?
In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.

What should banks do to protect their customers?
Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from
malware attacks via telephone, SMS, or emails.
