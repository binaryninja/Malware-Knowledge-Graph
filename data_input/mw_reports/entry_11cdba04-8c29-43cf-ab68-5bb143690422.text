This week, and based on current information as of the time of publication, SolarWinds announced a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability
into the SolarWinds® Orion® Platform software builds for versions 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 with no hotfix installed, and 2020.2 HF 1. This
vulnerability could enable an attacker to compromise the server(s) on which SolarWinds runs, and thus gain a foothold in the victim’s network.
Post compromise, the attacker can conduct lateral movement, data exfiltration and other threat activity.
The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published Emergency Directive 21-101, advising Federal
agencies to disconnect or power down all SolarWinds Orion products until further notice.
As with the 'FireEye Red Team Tools detection in QRadar’ blog, in this blog we’ll provide guidance that can help you use QRadar to respond
quickly.
This blog will cover the following topics and content extensions:
Threat Intelligence
Snort Rules
IBM Security QRadar Custom Properties for Snort
MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256
Pipe creation and Sysmon
IBM QRadar Custom Properties for Microsoft Windows
Endpoint content extension
IBM QRadar Endpoint Content Extension
IBM QRadar Custom Properties for Microsoft Windows
IBM QRadar Custom Properties for Linux

Threat Intelligence
IBM Security X-Force researchers published a collection of IOCs, including malicious file hashes, IP addresses and URLs, connected to this
on-going threat. These IOCs can easily be brought into QRadar using the Threat Intelligence App, which can be downloaded either from IBM
Security App Exchange or natively via the QRadar Assistant. Threat indicators can be added to a reference set so that they can be used
within building blocks, rules and searches to detect the presence of these IOCs within your environment. Public X-Force Collections, including
this one, are free to existing QRadar customers.
QRadar customers who also subscribe to the IBM Security X-Force Advanced Threat Protection Feed have access to a built-in “Am I
Affected?” featured with the Threat Intelligence app. This tool can be used in tandem with other forms of threat intelligence that may become
available in this developing situation to help assess known IOCs. With this subscription, new X-Force collections are loaded directly into
QRadar, and users can simply click ‘Scan now’ to automatically search for all IOCs associated with a collection. The query results will show
you which systems and users may have been connected to this threat, assisting you to initiate investigation, remediation and response.

Snort Rules
Once again, FireEye and Cisco Talos teams provided a new set of Snort rules to implement. QRadar users can easily create a new rule based
on these signatures, correlate these insights with other events, or optionally be alerted directly via email. The steps to implement this are:
1. Install the IBM Security QRadar Custom Properties for Snort content extension
2. Create a new Event rule
Apply Sunburst - Snort Rules on events which are detected by the Local system
and when the event(s) were detected by one or more of Snort Open Source IDS
and when the event matches "Rule ID" in
(77600832,77600833,77600842,77600843,77600844,77600845,77600846,77600847,77600848,77600850,77600851,77600852,77600853,77600
77600840,77600863,77600864,77600865,77600837,77600856,77600857,77600858,77600859,77600860,77600866,56660,56661,56662,56663,
AQL filter query

MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256
We talked about it, file hashes are a great source to improve threat detection. Once again, you can have a quick implementation by enabling
detection with MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 through three reference sets and one custom rule.

2/7

1. Create three Reference Sets, one per hash type, and populate them with the Sunburst_md5, Sunburst_sha1, Sunburst_sha256 files
(comma separated).

2. Install content extensions containing Hash properties or create your own.
On the App Exchange, you can find MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 parsed for the following devices:
Carbon Black Response, Cisco AMP, McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator, Microsoft Windows Defender ATP, Microsoft Windows Security
Event Log
3. Create a rule that tests the Custom Properties MD5 Hash, Parent MD5, SHA1 Hash, Parent SHA1 Hash, SHA256 Hash, Parent SHA256
Hash against the new Reference Sets.
Apply Sunburst - Tools Hash on events which are detected by the Local system
and when the event(s) were detected by one or more of Carbon Black Response, Cisco AMP, McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator,
Microsoft Windows Defender ATP, Microsoft Windows Security Event Log
and when the event matches ("MD5 Hash" IS NOT NULL AND REFERENCESETCONTAINS('Sunburst - MD5', "MD5 Hash")) OR
("Parent MD5" IS NOT NULL AND REFERENCESETCONTAINS('Sunburst - MD5', "Parent MD5")) OR ("SHA1 Hash" IS NOT
NULL AND REFERENCESETCONTAINS('Sunburst - SHA1', "SHA1 Hash")) OR ("Parent SHA1 Hash" IS NOT NULL AND
REFERENCESETCONTAINS('Sunburst - MD5', "Parent SHA1 Hash")) OR ("SHA256 Hash" IS NOT NULL AND
REFERENCESETCONTAINS('Sunburst - SHA256', "SHA256 Hash")) OR ("Parent SHA256 Hash" IS NOT NULL AND
REFERENCESETCONTAINS('Sunburst - SHA256', "Parent SHA256 Hash")) AQL filter query

Pipe creation and Sysmon
In the blog published by FireEye regarding SUNBURST, there is a mention about the creation of a pipe named 583da945-62af-10e8-4902a8f205c72b2e as one of the “delivery and installation” mechanism:

If you are collecting Sysmon logs, you have another opportunity for a quick way to detect another IOC.
1. Download the IBM QRadar Custom Properties for Microsoft Windows content extension
2. Create a rule that detects the pipe name mentioned in the blog
Apply Sunburst - Pipe Name on events which are detected by the Local system
and when the event(s) were detected by one or more of Microsoft Windows Security Event Log
and when the event QID is one of the following (5001836) PipeEvent (Pipe Created)
and when the event matches PipeName (custom) is any of 583da945-62af-10e8-4902-a8f205c72b2e

Endpoint content extension
This time I will be quick with this one, but I wanted to renew my recommendation to download the latest version of the Endpoint content pack.
The pack has been built to detect lateral movement, reconnaissance tools, help to make the difference between a legitimate administration
task from a suspicious one... All these behaviour have been mentioned in all the blogs you’ve read on the topic so far.
Below is the list of the rules (excluding building blocks) present in the Endpoint content extension

All these rules provide a wide spectrum of detection capabilities

Please refer to the documentation for more information on each rule. You can also refer to the Endpoint dedicated blog to have a better
understanding of the implementation of some use cases.

Threat Monitoring Content Extension
The multi-task pack ! This pack is mentioned last in this blog because it is certainly going to need some tuning to be adapted to what you are
looking for, but it is definitely a good help to know where to go.
As an example, thanks to your endpoint security software, you can increase the visibility on a threat spreading through the network. Indeed,
this extension contains a series of rules alerting on security software.

5/7

All you have to do is to:
1. Ensure your device is listed in one of BB:DeviceDefinition: AV/AM or BB:DeviceDefinition: IDS / IPS Building blocks
2. Get the Threat Name parsed either by downloading one of our content extension, or creating your own extraction.
You can decide to duplicate the rules to focus the detection on SUNBURST specifically, and have a higher priority rule response (email, SNMP
trap, vulnerability scan). Simply add a new filter to the original rule, catching the specific Threat Name reported by your product:
and when the event matches Threat Name (custom) is any of Backdoor.Sunburst
Please refer to your product documentation to get more information on the relevant detection name

Conclusion
The above steps can enable you to easily take advantage of the publicly available IOCs and Countermeasures to detect indicators of the
SUNBURST threat within your environment. All of the QRadar apps, custom properties and content extensions mentioned above are available
free of charge to all QRadar customers and can be downloaded either from the IBM Security App Exchange or natively via QRadar Assistant.
As usual, we build content for you, to save you time and effort, a content that you can use as a base and adapt to your environment and your
needs. Don't hesitate to give us any feedback or ideas, tell us what you need.
