Fake Purchase Order Used to Deliver Agent Tesla

March 7, 2022

Since the dawn of phishing, fraudulent invoicing and purchasing schemes have been one of the most
common lures. The usual modus operandi involves appealing to the recipient’s desire to avoid incurring a
debt, especially where a business may be involved.
FortiGuard Labs recently came across an interesting phishing e-mail masquerading as a purchase order
addressed to a Ukrainian manufacturing organization that deals with raw materials and chemicals. The email contained a PowerPoint attachment that is in reality a sophisticated, multi-stage effort to deploy the
Agent Tesla RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
What makes this campaign unique is the usage of PPAM, which is a file format that is not very common. A
PPAM is a Microsoft PowerPoint add-in that gives developers extra functionality, such as extra commands,
custom macros, and new tools. This blog will detail the infection process and subsequent malware
deployment.
Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Users: Windows users
Impact: Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor

Severity Level: Medium

Examining the phishing e-mail
Like so many computer-based attacks, this one began as a phishing e-mail sent to an organization in
Ukraine.
Figure 1. E-mail to the target recipient.
Spelling and grammar issues aside, like most good phishing campaigns this one provides a time sensitive
statement urging the recipient to urgently review the attached order.
Looking deeper at the e-mail and where it came from, we can see some additional information in the
headers.
Figure 2. E-mail headers showing the origin of the message.
Figure 2b. Parked page.
The e-mail originated at an address of 194[.]99[.]46[.]38 that corresponds to slot0.warongsoto.com. This is
hosted on a run-of-the-mill VPS server. Visiting the server, we noticed that the site states that the server
control panel is controlled by VESTA. Recent CVE data highlights that Vesta Control Panel is affected by
remote command execution and elevation of privilege vulnerabilities that ultimately allow for full
compromise of the system (CVE-2020-10786 and CVE-2020-10787).
The domain itself appears to be either abandoned or at least unused with no active content hosted. It was
registered in the United States in October 2021.
The originating e-mail address does not appear to reference an actual individual and a search for other
instances of this being used elsewhere came up empty.

Examining the dropper – stage 1
Phase 1
Dropping the final payload occurs in multiple phases, making this, in actuality, a very complex operation.
As shown in Figure 1, attached to the e-mail is the file “order001.ppam”. This is an add-in file format used
by Microsoft PowerPoint that, in this case, contains a malicious macro that acts as a dropper for Agent
Tesla.
The first phase of stage 1 begins with opening the PPAM attachment to activate the macro contained
within.
Figure 3. Visual Basic macro contained within “order001.ppam”.
Once the macro is executed, it will reach out to the URL shortener Bit.ly to download the next phase of the
dropper. The address used is: hXXp://www[.]bitly[.]com/awnycnxbcxncbrpopor/

Phase 2

2/9

The call out to Bitly will be redirected to a location on MediaFire – a file hosting site
(hXXp://download2261[.]mediafire[.]com/6lcqxbws032g/wctsdmx4dsh95xs/19.htm). As possibly inferred,
this was a campaign and not simply directed at one recipient. There were multiple files made available
over several days, as shown below in Figure 4.
Figure 4. MediaFire repository showing multiple other files from this campaign.
Each of the files is very similar (with minor tweaks) to the download location of the next step. Figure 5,
below, shows 19.htm as it appears if downloaded directly.
Figure 5. HTM file as it appears when downloaded.
If we arrange the file into a more readable format, we get a better sense of what it’s trying to do.
Figure 6. Key part of the HTM file.
As seen in Figure 6, the file attempts to taskkill several applications and services followed by adding a
scheduled task into the Windows Task scheduler. The script then attempts to download and execute
another file from MediaFire - hXXp://www[.]mediafire[.]com/file/otza6n31talvvle/19.dll.

Phase 3
While the file extension gives the impression of a Microsoft dynamic link library (.dll), 19.dll is in actuality a
PowerShell script containing instructions in a large amount of hexadecimal data.
Figure 7. HTM file as it appears when downloaded.
Once executed, the hexadecimal data will be transformed into additional PowerShell commands that will
run in memory. For example, new registry keys will be added to assist with persistence.
Figure 8. Added entries to the Windows Registry.
If captured and reviewed, the entries that stand out the most are two large, compressed byte arrays —
$nona and $STRDYFUGIHUYTYRTESRDYUGIRI.
Figure 9. Large byte arrays.
As can be seen in Figure 9, the byte arrays are then decompressed for use. Once decompressed, these
can be saved as executable Windows files. $nona is the larger of the two and is Agent Tesla.
$STRDYFUGIHUYTYRTESRDYUGIRI will inject Agent Tesla into a running Windows process.
Renaming 19.dll to 19.ps1 allows it to be executed as a normal PowerShell script. With this particular
sample, it will attempt to launch and then inject Agent Tesla into the aspnet_compiler.exe application.
Figure 10. On the left, the PowerShell script can be seen to be launching aspnet_compiler.exe

Examining the malware – stage 2
At its core, Agent Tesla is a keylogger and RAT (Remote Access Trojan). It will take any results captured
from the keyboard and clipboard and send them back to its C2 (Command and Control) server. In this
instance, once injected into the aspnet_compiler.exe process Agent Tesla will be up and running. With
entries in the registry it will have persistence to run even if the host machine is rebooted.

3/9

Figure 11. Agent Tesla running inside a debugger.
As can be seen in Figure 11, this variant is similar to one FortiGuard Labs has analyzed previously.
From this point, it will run in the background and observe the user, recording their actions and sending
them back to the threat actor.

Conclusion
Threat actors for the most part like to use lures that are tried and true, as was the case here with the
invoicing phishing e-mail, because they continue to enjoy success. The dropper attached to the phishing
e-mail shows the continuing evolution and complexity required to evade modern security controls
combined with the need to traverse several gates to arrive at the release point for the final payload.
Once finally deployed to a system, the ability to obfuscate and hide inside everyday files and processes
proves that Agent Tesla is a very capable and formidable threat. Unfortunately, this trend towards
increasing sophistication is unlikely to abate any time soon.
