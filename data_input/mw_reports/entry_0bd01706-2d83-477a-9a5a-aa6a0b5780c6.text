ESET researchers discovered a campaign that uses two malicious tools with similar capabilities
to ensure both resilience and broader potential for the attackers
Zuzana Hromcová 14 Aug 2019 - 11:30AM
We’ve discovered an ongoing campaign in the Balkans spreading two tools having a similar
purpose: a backdoor and a remote access trojan we named, respectively, BalkanDoor and
BalkanRAT.
BalkanRAT enables the attacker to remotely control the compromised computer via a graphical
interface, i.e., manually; BalkanDoor enables them to remotely control the compromised computer
via a command line, i.e., possibly en masse. ESET security products detect these threats as
Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor.
A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends
up having both these tools deployed on their computer, each of them capable of fully controlling
the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the
most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice.
The campaign’s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and
decoy PDFs all involving taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the ﬁnancial departments of
organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access
are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is ﬁnancially motivated.
The campaign has been active at least from January 2016 to the time of writing (the most recent
detections in our telemetry are from July 2019). Some parts of the campaign were brieﬂy
described by a Serbian security provider in 2016 and the Croatian CERT in 2017. Each of these
sources focused only on one of the two tools and only on a single country. However, our research
shows that there is a signiﬁcant overlap in targets and also in the attackers’ tactics, techniques
and procedures.
Our ﬁndings show that the mentioned attacks have been orchestrated and we consider them a
single long-term campaign that spans Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our research has also shed more light at the malware used in this campaign and provided some
context. We’ve discovered a new version of BalkanDoor with a new method for
execution/installation: an exploit of the WinRAR ACE vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250). Further,
we’ve seen both malicious tools digitally signed with various certiﬁcates the developers paid for to
add perceived legitimacy. One of them, issued to SLOW BEER LTD, was even valid at the time of
writing; we’ve notiﬁed the issuer about the misuse and they revoked the certiﬁcate.

In this article, we will describe some notable features of both BalkanDoor and BalkanRAT. Our
analysis shows that the former runs as a Windows service, which allows it to unlock the Windows
logon screen remotely and without the password or start a process with the highest possible
privileges. The latter misuses a legitimate remote desktop software (RDS) product and uses extra
tools and scripts to hide its presence from the victim, such as hiding the window, tray icon,
process and so on.

Targets and distribution
Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor spread in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina. (These countries, along with Slovenia and former Macedonia, formed the country of
Yugoslavia until 1992.)

Figure 1. Malware distribution by country

According to our telemetry, the campaign spreading these tools has been live since 2016, with the
most recent detections as late as in July 2019.
The attackers have been distributing their tools via malicious emails (“malspam”) with links
leading to a malicious ﬁle.
The links included in the malspam emails used for distribution of both BalkanRAT and
BalkanDoor mimic legitimate websites of ofﬁcial institutions.

Most often, the links leading to an executable ﬁle are disguised as links to a PDF. The executable
ﬁle is a WinRAR self-extractor with its name and icon changed to resemble a PDF to fool the
user. When executed, it is conﬁgured to unpack its content, open the decoy PDF to prevent any
suspicion – and silently execute either BalkanRAT or BalkanDoor.
In some of the latest samples of BalkanDoor detected in 2019, the malware is distributed as an
ACE archive, disguised as a RAR archive (i.e., not an executable ﬁle), specially crafted to exploit
the WinRAR ACE vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250). This vulnerability, which has been remediated
in version 5.70 released on February 28th, 2019, is known to have been exploited quite often to
distribute malware.
The exploit-based deployment of BalkanDoor is stealthier than in previous versions of the
malware because it does not require executing the downloaded ﬁle – an operation that might
raise the intended victim’s suspicions.

The campaign
According to our telemetry, most of the time, both tools have been deployed on the same
machine. The combination of the tools gives the attacker both a command-line interface and a
graphical interface to the compromised computer.
In the case of the whole toolset being deployed on the machine, here is an example scenario for
the attack:
The attacker detects that the victim has their screen locked and thus, most probably, is not using
the computer (either via BalkanDoor sending screenshot showing that computer is locked, or via
the View Only mode of BalkanRAT). Via the BalkanDoor backdoor, the attacker sends a backdoor
command to unlock the screen… and using BalkanRAT, they can do whatever they want on the
computer.
However, even if the victim does not use their computer, the chance of them spotting the actions
performed by the attackers is still there. Even with this disadvantage, using the RDS tool may be
useful. The attacker is not limited by the commands shipped in the backdoor, or by their
programming skills: manually, they can perform actions that would require writing a lot of code if a
backdoor was the only tool available.
In principle, the Balkan- toolset could be used for espionage, among other possible goals.
However, not only the campaign’s targets and distribution, but also our analysis of the Balkantoolset tools show that the attackers are going after money instead of espionage.
The BalkanDoor backdoor does not implement any exﬁltration channel. Presumably, if the
campaign were intended for espionage, the attackers would need an exﬁltration channel for
uploading the collected data – at least as a backup to manual exﬁltration, which might not be
always an option.
On the contrary – and supporting the notion that the attackers’ goal has been to commit some
ﬁnancial crime – we’ve seen BalkanRAT dropping a tool that can list available smart cards, via the
SCardListReadersA/ SCardConnectA API functions. Smart cards are usually issued by banks or
governments for conﬁrmation of the holder’s identity. If misused, smart cards can facilitate
illegal/fraudulent activities, e.g. digitally signing a contract, validating a money transaction etc.
https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/
In the past, we’ve seen this feature in Operation Buhtrap, a campaign targeting Russian banks.

Analysis – BalkanDoor
BalkanDoor is a simple backdoor with a small number of commands (download and execute a
ﬁle, create a remote shell, take a screenshot). It can be used to automate tasks on the
compromised computer or to automatically control several affected computers at once. We have
seen six versions of the backdoor, ranging in supported commands, evolving since 2016.
The initial dropper unpacks all components, opens a decoy PDF (in some cases) and executes a
batch installation script that ensures persistence of the backdoor.
The backdoor registers itself as a service, under a legitimately-looking service name (e.g.
WindowsSvc, WindowsPrnt, WindowsConn or WindowsErr); the accompanying batch scripts can
further ensure persistence by using Registry Run Keys or Startup folder.
After the backdoor is installed, the computer connects to a C&C server, identifying itself by the
computer name and requesting the commands. The backdoor can connect to any of the C&Cs
from a hardcoded list – a measure to increase resilience. It connects via the HTTP or HTTPS
protocol; if HTTPS is used, then the server certiﬁcates are ignored.
If the connection is not successful, the backdoor is capable of using the user-conﬁgured proxy on
the victim’s computer and repeating the connection attempt.
The backdoor commands come in a format of an INI ﬁle, with properties determining the
commands, command arguments and intended recipients. Specifying the list of recipients allows
the attacker to send their commands to several compromised computers at once, e.g. to
automatically take screenshots of all compromised computers.
Commands

Functionality

cn

Speciﬁes computer name(s) of the intended recipients of the commands

du, int

Download and execute a ﬁle

du, ra, de, rpo

Download and execute a ﬁle, in the speciﬁed context and on a speciﬁed desktop

rip

Create a remote shell accessible from the speciﬁed IP address

scr_int, scr_dur

Capture a series of screenshots of the speciﬁed duration

Furthermore, the backdoor itself can be executed in several modes, determined by the command
line arguments with which it is executed. These modes themselves can serve as backdoor
commands (when executed from the remote shell):
Argument

Functionality

/unlock

Unlocks the screen

/rcmd

Creates a remote shell and redirects its input/output to the speciﬁed IP address

/takescr

Captures a series of screenshots, duration determined by other arguments

/run

Executes the speciﬁed command using cmd.exe

/runx

Executes the speciﬁed command using cmd.exe, on the active (input) desktop

https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/

/inst

Installs itself as a service and starts the main procedure (see /nosvc)

5/18

8/15/2019

/start

Starts the associated service, which starts the main procedure (see /nosvc)

/nosvc

Main payload, communicates with C&C and interprets backdoor commands

Among the BalkanDoor capabilities, the most notable is passwordless screen-unlocking.
This feature comes in handy to the attackers in cases when a logged-in user locks the computer.
The “Lock screen” is just another Desktop for the system, so any malware with the necessary
privileges can switch to a real desktop by command. No password is required to perform this
operation.

Figure 3. Code responsible for unlocking the computer when the backdoor is executed remotely with an “/unlock” argument

Analysis – BalkanRAT
The BalkanRAT part of the malicious Balkan- toolset is more complex compared to its backdoor
accomplice. Its goal is to deploy a copy of the Remote Utilities software, which is commercial
software by a Russian vendor, Remote Utilities, LLC, used for remote access to a computer or for
remote administration. BalkanRAT also provides the attacker with the credentials needed for this
remote access.
BalkanRAT has several additional components to help load, install and conceal the existence of
the RDS. They can add exceptions to the ﬁrewall, hide the RDS’s window and its tray icon, and
hide the presence of related processes in the task manager.

Figure 4. Components used in the campaign to deploy and hide the presence of the RDS

1. The dropper ﬁrst unpacks all components; a conﬁguration ﬁle, the remote desktop software
and a core component installing it, a userland rootkit, a GUI hider and a decoy PDF ﬁle.
2. The dropper opens the PDF ﬁle so as not to arouse suspicion of the user.
3. Covertly, the dropper executes the core component (32-bit) in the installation mode.
4. The core component (32-bit) installs itself to be executed with each start, and adds
exception to the ﬁrewall for the RDS. It executes commands inst1 and inst2 speciﬁed in the
conﬁguration ﬁle, and executes itself again, now in stealth mode.
5. In this mode, the core component acts like a keylogger.
6. The core component (32-bit) executes the 64-bit version of itself, in injection mode (if
applicable).
7. The core component (64-bit) injects the userland rootkit (64-bit) into task manager
processes. The userland rootkit then hides presence of the malicious processes in the task
manager.
8. The core component (32-bit) executes the RDS. It repeatedly monitors and hides the RDS
window (because it is a GUI application).
9. The core component (32-bit) injects the userland rootkit (32-bit) into task manager
processes. The userland rootkit then hides presence of the malicious processes in the task
manager.
10. The core component (32-bit) executes commands cmd1 and cmd2, as speciﬁed in the
conﬁguration ﬁle. One of such commands was seen executing a GUI hider, which is an
AutoHotKey script hiding the tray icon of the RDS.
Note: Some components are optional. Also, sometimes they are deployed as a set comprising an
encrypted payload and the corresponding loader. We are omitting these details.
The conﬁguration ﬁle of BalkanRAT is in INI ﬁle format (similarly to BalkanDoor, which uses this
format for backdoor commands), with one section named [CFG]. The INI ﬁle is used by the
malware’ core component and the userland rootkit.

Figure 5. BalkanRAT’s conﬁguration ﬁle – properties (top) and example (below)

BalkanRAT’s core is a multipurpose component (there are both a 32-bit and a 64-bit versions); it
can be executed in various modes, determined by the command-line argument. Most signiﬁcantly,
it is used for installation of BalkanRAT, launching a userland rootkit and adding exceptions for the
RDS component in the ﬁrewall.
Argu‐
ment

Functionality

/rhc

Executes a batch ﬁle

/fwl

Adds exception to the ﬁrewall for the speciﬁed program

/sreg

Sets conﬁguration data for the RDS in the registry (especially email address where the
credentials should be sent)

/inst

Ensures persistence by adding itself to the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Mi‐
crosoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows] registry key under the “load” entry. Adds
exception for the RDS to the local ﬁrewall. Executes itself again in the main mode (no
arguments).

/inj

Injects the userland rootkit library into processes, as speciﬁed in the conﬁguration ﬁle

(none)

Main mode. Executes the 64-bit version of itself (if applicable), injects the userland rootkit,
executes the RDS and hides the window by changing its coordinates to values outside the
screen.
Another thread captures pressed keystrokes.

The main part of the BalkanRAT malware is a copy of the Remote Utilities software for remote
access. Instead of using the ofﬁcial version, BalkanRAT deploys a copy signed by a certiﬁcate of
the attacker.
The client side of the RDS running on the victim’s computer must know the unique ID and the
password, both generated on the server side, to connect to the server. The RDS deployed by
BalkanRAT is conﬁgured in such a way that the password is the same for all victims, and the
generated unique ID is sent to the attacker’s email address by the tool itself.
Since the tool BalkanRAT misuses is legitimate, it leverages the genuine Remote Utilities’
infrastructure for this communication (rutils.com, server.rutils.com); due to this, the
communication may seem legitimate to the user – and to security products.

As a result, the attacker has obtained credentials to access the compromised computer via the
Remote Utilities software. Using this tool, they can broadcast the screen to monitor the activity of
the user and manually take over the compromised computer.

Figure 6. A window the victim never sees. With a legitimate copy of Remote Utilities, this
window is visible; however, BalkanRAT will hide it using the GUI hider feature.

To remain stealthy, BalkanRAT uses the GUI hider feature. In most samples (some older ones are
an exception), it is implemented as an AutoHotKey script, compiled into an executable ﬁle so that
it can be run on a computer even if AutoHotKey is not installed there. The purpose of this script is
to hide the tray icon of the RDS client.

Figure 7. AutoHotKey script embedded in the resource section of the executable

Another notable feature used by BalkanRAT to stay hidden is the ability to hide processes from
the user.

To achieve this, userland rootkit libraries are injected in processes hardcoded in the conﬁguration
ﬁle. The userland rootkit hooks the NtQuerySystemInformation function for the process in which it
is injected. In case SystemProcessInformation is queried, it ﬁlters out all entries for processes
with the names speciﬁed in the conﬁguration ﬁle. As a result, conventional task manager utilities
will not display the processes the attackers want to keep hidden from the user.

Figure 8. With the userland rootkit injected, some processes are missing in the list (left). Without the rootkit, the processes
are visible (right).

Naturally, the list of processes that will be hidden contain mostly ones belonging to BalkanRAT.
However, we have also seen names like “weather.exe” or “preserve.exe” in the list – which belong
to the BalkanDoor backdoor. This ﬁnding supports the belief these two tools are indeed used
together.

Conclusion
Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor have some interesting tricks up their sleeves and each of them
separately pose a signiﬁcant risk to the victims. If used together as a toolset, they make an even
more powerful weapon – the more the campaign we have discovered targets accounting, a
function that is critical for organizations.
The campaign targeting accountants in the Balkans shows some similarities with a campaign
aimed at Ukrainian notaries reported in 2016. (The only source we have been able to ﬁnd
describing it is in Russian.) In that case, the attackers’ goal was to take control over a notary
computer and issue some illegal operation on behalf of the notary.
Just as attackers may conﬁrm a fraudulent transaction on behalf of a notary, they may perform a
fraudulent transaction while impersonating a manager in a company’s ﬁnancial department.
To stay safe, business users – and their employers – should follow basic cybersecurity rules: be
cautious about emails and scrutinize their attachments and links, keep their software updated and
use a reputable security solution.
