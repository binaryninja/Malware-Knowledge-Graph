Cellular technology has caused large changes throughout society in recent decades. Besides
providing telephony services, cellular devices store and process personal information, provide
enterprise connectivity, and act as the primary portal to the internet for many individuals.
Phones, tablets, laptops, wearables, cellular modems in vehicles, and other industry specific
equipment all have the ability to access cellular networks. The cellular infrastructure of the
United States is transitioning from older 2nd Generation (2G) and 3rd Generation (3G) cellular
technologies to newer 4th Generation (4G) technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE).
LTE is now the dominant air interface technology across the United States and is seeing rapid
adoption in countries across the globe.

The purpose of this document is to provide information to organizations regarding the security
capabilities of cellular networks based on LTE technology. LTE networks are rarely deployed in
a standalone fashion and instead are integrated alongside the previous generations of cellular
systems - however they are out of scope for the technology overview of this document. Because
2G and 3G networks are deployed alongside LTE networks, these older cellular systems are
discussed within the threats and mitigations section of this document.

The document is primarily scoped to analyzing the security of the systems traditionally owned
and/or operated by a wireless provider, but also includes organizations writing firmware to
operate the System on a Chip (SoC) inside of a mobile device that communicates with cellular
infrastructure. The wireless providers, also known as mobile network operators (MNOs), operate
the cellular LTE air interface, backhaul, core network, and portions of a user’s mobile device,
including the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) hardware token and the Universal
Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) software application. All of these entities will be fully
described within this document.
The mobile device hardware, mobile operating system security (e.g., Android, Blackberry, iOS,
Windows Phone), and 3rd party mobile applications are generally out of the scope of this
document unless otherwise noted. This document does not analyze non-3GPP networks (e.g.,
WiFi, WiMAX, 3GPP2), forthcoming 3GPP features such as device to device cellular
communications and cellular internet of things (IoT), and the over-the-air (OTA) management
updates to cellular platforms. Finally, the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a modern platform

238

for delivering services such as Voice over LTE (VoLTE), is not included within this document.

The terms "cell" and "cellular" are used interchangeably.
The term "base station" is used as a standards agnostic term of referring to a cellular
tower communicating with a mobile device, and is often used when discussing the
interaction between 2G, 3G, and 4G systems. Each set of standards uses a specific term
for base station, and LTE employs the term evolved Node B, which is shortened to
eNodeB or eNB. eNodeB is generally used in this document, but when standards are
quoted or specific cryptographic keys referenced, the term eNB may be used.
The term "mobile device" is used as a standards agnostic term of referring to the User
Equipment (UE) (e.g., cellphone, tablet, cellular dongle).
The LTE standards heavily use the term Evolved Packet System (EPS) which is used
interchangeably with "LTE" within this document.
The LTE standards heavily use the term Evolved Packet Core (EPC), which is used
interchangeably with the term “core”.

275

A cellular network is a wireless network with a distributed coverage area made up of cellular
sites housing radio equipment. A cellular site is often owned and operated by a wireless
telecommunications company, internet service provider, or possibly government entity. The
wireless telecommunications company, or mobile network operator (MNO), providing service to
end users may own the cellular site, or pay for access to the cellular infrastructure - as is the case
with mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). MNOs distribute cellular radio equipment
throughout a large geographic region, and connect them back to a core network they typically
own and operate. In areas receiving poor cellular service, such as inside a building, MNOs may
provide a signal booster or small-scale base station directly to the end user to operate.

Before LTE, cellular systems were modeled after the traditional wireline telephony system in
that a dedicated circuit was provided to a user making a telephone call, ensuring a minimal
guarantee of service. In comparison to circuit switched cellular networks of the past, LTE
networks utilize packet switching. An LTE network provides consistent Internet Protocol (IP)
connectivity between an end user's mobile device and IP services on the data network, while
maintaining connectivity when moving from tower to tower (e.g., mobility).

LTE is a mobile broadband communication standard defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP), a worldwide standards development organization. Implementations of LTE
networks are being deployed across the globe and installations continue to increase as the
demand for high-speed mobile networks is constantly rising. Within TS 22.278 [9], 3GPP
defines number of high-level goals for LTE systems to meet, including:
•
•
•

287
288
289
290
291
292

•
•

Provide increased data speeds with decreased latency,
Build upon the security foundations of previous cellular systems,
Support interoperability between current and next generation cellular systems and other
data networks,
Improve system performance while maintaining current quality of service, and
Maintain interoperability with legacy systems.

The following sections explain the fundamental concepts of LTE technology and architecture,
network protocols, and the evolution of the 3GPP security.

Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a 2G circuit switched cellular technology.
Although GSM was not initially defined by 3GPP, 3GPP took control of the standard to
maintain, enhance, and use it as a foundation to make future developments. 3GPP's first
extension of GSM was the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), referred to as a 2.5G
technology. GPRS was the first method of sending non-voice data over a cellular network, and
was quickly followed by the Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), sometimes
referred to as a 2.75G technology.

303
304

The first voice standard defined by 3GPP was the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS), which is a 3G circuit switched technology. Soon after the development of UMTS,

3GPP packet switched technologies were evolved into multiple variants collectively referred to
as High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), which is arguably considered 3.5G, although certain
mobile devices will display an HSPA connection as 4G. HSPA was created to increase data
throughput on both the downlink and uplink connections.

LTE needs to support a growing demand for higher data rates and quality of service. It also needs
to be able to quickly support new advances in technology, and LTE’s packet switched foundation
will make it easier to upgrade/update the technology as well as lower the complexity of the
overall network. To meet these goals, LTE was introduced via 3GPP Release 8, which was
frozen on December 11, 2008. All subsequent releases of LTE have built upon this baseline.
3GPP defines a series of specifications dedicated to the technological requirements for LTE,
known as the 36 series. 3GPP also defines a series of specifications for security, known as the 33
series. Each 3GPP series is comprised of Technical Report (TR) and Technical Specification
(TS) documents. For a new feature there are typically multiple approaches and possible solutions
investigated within a TR. Once a single solution for the feature is agreed upon, it is standardized
within a TS. This document is based on 3GPP Release 12, which was frozen on March 13, 2015
[1].

The following section describes important high level concepts and components of LTE networks
that are used and discussed throughout the course of this document. One of the fundamental
concepts to understand is the overall network architecture: mobile devices (UEs) connect to base
stations (eNodeBs) via radio signals, and the base stations transmit and receive IP packets to and
from the core network. The core ntework has a large number of entry and exit points, including
the internet and connections to other cellular networks. Figure 1 illustrates these high-level
concepts.

In contrast to earlier cellular network technologies that use a hybrid of circuit-switched
technology for voice and packet-switched technology for data, LTE solely uses packet switched,
IP-based technology. In the LTE architecture, voice traffic traverses the network over the data
connection using protocols, such as VoLTE, which is similar to Voice Over IP (VoIP). VoLTE is
being deployed with widespread adoption by MNOs in the US. MNOs may revert back to legacy
circuit switched cellular networks to handle voice calls and short message service (SMS)
messages by using a mechanism known as circuit switched fallback (CSFB).

Mobile devices are the primary endpoint in cellular networks, interacting with base stations via
radio signals to send and receive information. A mobile device is composed of two distinct
systems: the general purpose mobile OS (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows Phone) that users interact
with and the telephony subsystem used to access the cellular network. The telephony subsystem
contains a distinct application processor referred to as the baseband processor, which has its own
operating system used to interact with the cellular network, often developed by the cellular SoC
manufacturer.

349

354

LTE standards refer to a mobile device as the User Equipment (UE), which refers to both the
terminal with the mobile operating system, baseband processor, and LTE radio, and the
removable hardware token housing security-critical information used to obtain network access.
This removable hardware token is colloquially referred to as the SIM card, but LTE standards
use the term Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). The UICC, which is essentially a
smartcard, runs a Java application known as the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM).
The USIM interfaces with the cellular radio and subsequently the mobile network. The UICC
contains secret cryptographic keys that are shared with the MNO before it is provisioned to a
user.

355
356
357
358
359

There are two distinct identifiers used in cellular networks: The International Mobile Subscriber
Identity (IMSI) and the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI). The IMSI is the longterm identity that the carrier uses to identify a subscriber. The IMEI is used to identify a specific

Mobile Devices

User equipment (UE): Cellular device (cell phone, tablet, LTE modem, etc) includes the
following:
o Mobile Equipment (ME): The mobile terminal without the hardware token.
o UICC: A smart card that stores personal information, cryptographic keys, and is
responsible for running java applications that enable network access. This smart
card is inserted into the ME.
o International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI): Terminal identity used to
identify the mobile device to the cellular network.
o International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI): User identity used to identify
a subscriber to the cellular network.

In addition to the IMEI and IMSI, other identities exist in LTE, including the Globally Unique
Temporary Identity (GUTI) and the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI). The GUTI
can identify a UE to a network without having to send the long-term identity (i.e., IMSI). The
security implications of clear-text transmission of the IMSI will be discussed in later sections.
Different identities are used for various reasons, including limiting the exposure of a permanent
identity, to minimize tracking of a device as it accesses multiple services on the network.

Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN). UEs connect to the E-UTRAN to send data to the core
network. The E-UTRAN is a mesh network composed of base stations. A base station, or
Evolved Node B, modulates and demodulates radio signals to communicate with UEs. eNodeBs
then act as a relay point to create and send IP packets to and from the core network. Cellular
networks are designed to pass connectivity from one radio access device in the E-UTRAN to the
next as the connected UE changes location. This seamless handoff ability allows devices to have
a constant connection with minimal interruptions providing the mobility benefit of cellular
networks. eNodeBs use the X2 interface to communicate with each other, primarily transmiting
control signaling to allow for LTE network communication enabling UE mobility. During this
handover the serving eNodeB must transfer all UE context, cellular paramaters and other
information about the UE, to the receiving eNodeB.

LTE uses a concept of named interfaces to easily identify the communication link between two
endpoints. A named interface in LTE terminology, such as the X2 interface, refers to the logical
link between two endpoints, and in this example two eNodeBs. Named interfaces in LTE are
responsible for sending and receiving specified messages and data. These can be physically
implemented in a variety of ways and multiple named interfaces can share the same physical
connection. This physical connection can be a variety of network technologies such as fiber,
Ethernet, microwave, satellite link etc.

The evolved packet core (EPC), illustrated in Figure 3, is the routing and computing brain of the
LTE network. UEs receive control signals through base stations originating from the Mobility
Management Entity (MME). The MME performs a large number of functions including
managing and storing UE contexts, creating temporary identifiers, paging, controlling
authentication functions, and selecting the Serving Gateway (S-GW) and Packet Data Network
Gateway (P-GW), respectively. No user traffic is sent through the MME. The S-GW anchors the
UEs for intra-eNodeB handoffs and routes information between the P-GW and the E-UTRAN.
The P-GW is the default router for the UE, making transfers between 3GPP and non-3GPP
services, allocating IP addresses to UEs, and providing access to the PDN.

An LTE network minimally consists of a UE, a group of cellular towers and nodes (E-UTRAN),
and the core network (EPC) controlled by the MNO. The E-UTRAN is connected to the EPC via
a network link known as the backhaul, from a security perspective it is important to note the EUTRAN and EPC are most likely in completely different geographic locations. Thus, the
interfaces that link them may or may not be contained totally within the MNO’s private domain.
This section will explore various operational network topologies such as fixed and deployable
LTE networks.

A fixed LTE network is a typical implementation of a cellular network utilizing multiple cell
sites to provide a wide spread coverage area to a large geographic area. In this type of
architecture, the core network components are generally in separate locations. The cell sites that
house the eNodeBs connect to the EPC through the backhaul. The backhaul connection can be
provided by a multitude of technologies (e.g., microwave, satellite, fiber, etc). An MNO would
typically deploy this type of network architecture. Although LTE networks require the same
functional components in order to operate effectively, the quantity and placement of these
components is completely dependent on the MNO’s network design. It is possible the network
operator incorporates multiple EPC components that serve critical functions as well as load
balances these components to provide increased availability.

An example of a fixed LTE network is a large region being provided network coverage with the
use of many spread out cell sites housing eNodeBs all connecting back into one or multiple
EPCs. Multiple eNodeBs are interconnected through the X2 interface, which is responsible for
session handover from one eNodeB to next as the UE travels. Ultimately the components of the

A deployable LTE network is a compact network able to be deployed in areas where no LTE
coverage exists, or where coverage has been interrupted. The deployable network can be mobile
and packaged in different form factors (e.g., mounted on a vehicle, trailer, backpack). These
types of LTE architectures can be used to create a self-contained network or be connected to an
existing LTE, or other, network. The hardware used in a deployable network is generally more
compact and capable of handling only a fraction of the throughput and capacity of a fixed LTE
network.

A Cell on Wheels, or COW, is an example of a commercially available deployable LTE network.
These COWs are environments that include all elements of an LTE network and are mounted on
trailers or in some cases packaged onto vehicles. COWs often still need to be connected back to
the core network. These types of deployable can be used to provide additional capacity to an
existing network where there is an increased demand, for example a large sporting event. These
can also be used where network coverage is not available, such as a natural disaster site, in order
to provide first responders a means of communication. These LTE networks are commercially
available and can be purchased from network equipment providers.

The following protocols are used for communication over the air interface (the radio link
between the UE and the eNodeB). This protocol suite is referred to as the air interface protocol
stack, which is generally divided into three layers. Logically, these protocols set the foundation
for all TCP/IP traffic operating above it. These protocols are:

Each protocol within the air interface cellular stack performs a series of functions and operates
on one of two logical planes: the user plane or the control plane. The user plane is the logical
plane responsible for carrying user data being sent over the network (e.g., voice communication,
SMS, application traffic) while the control plane is responsible for carrying all of the signaling
communication needed for the UE to be connected. To make the technology evolution paths
somewhat independent, the 3GPP specifications partition the cellular protocols into two strata;
the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) and the Access Stratum (AS). The AS is all communication
between the UE and eNodeB occurring via the RF channel. The NAS consists of all non-radio
signaling traffic between UE and MME. All of a user's TCP/IP and other application traffic are
transmitted via the user plane. The control plane, which is required to setup, maintain, and
terminate the air interface connection between the UE and the MME, hosts the RRC protocol.
The PDCP, RLC, MAC, and PHY layers form the foundation of the air interface and are part of
both user and control planes. The aforementioned control and user planes operate on top of these
protocols.
The RRC performs a variety of control tasks such as broadcasting system information,
establishing a connection with the eNodeB, paging, performing authentication, bearer
establishment, and transferring Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages. The PDCP performs
header compression, packet reordering, retransmission, and access stratum security (including
integrity and confidentiality protections). As stated in TS 33.401, all cryptographic protection,
both confidentiality and integrity, is mandated to occur at the PDCP layer [5]. The RLC readies
packets to be transferred over the air interface and transfers data to the MAC layer. It also
performs packet reordering and retransmission operations. The MAC performs multiplexing,
channel scheduling, Quality of Service (QoS) activities, and creates a logical mapping of data to
the PHY layer. The PHY layer provides error management, signal processing, and modulates

In LTE networks, connections must be established between endpoints before user traffic can be
communicated, and these connections are called bearers. A bearer is a connection between two
endpoints that contains specific information about the traffic class, bit rate, delivery order,
reliability, priority, and quality of service for its connection. A bearer may span multiple
interfaces. It is important to note that there are two main types of bearers: signaling radio bearers
and transport bearers. Signaling radio bearers are established on the control plane in order to
allow signaling communication between the UE and eNodeB, and the eNodeB and MME.
Transport bearers are established along the path of the user plane in order to allow transmission
of user data to its desired endpoint.

541

There are three signaling radio bearers that must be established which are solely used for the
purpose of transmitting RRC and NAS messages [30]:

LTE Bearers

Signaling Radio Bearer 0 (SRB0): SRB0 is responsible for establishing the RRC
connection between the UE and eNodeB.
Signaling Radio Bearer 1 (SRB1): SRB1 is responsible for the exchange of security
information, measurement reports, fallback parameters, and handover information.
Signaling Radio Bearer 2 (SRB2): SRB2 is responsible for the transferring of
measurement information as well as NAS messages. SRB2 is always configured after the
establishment of SRB1 and security activation.

Once the SRBs are set up, the UE is connected to the core network through a specific eNodeB,
and is ready to transmit and receive user data. Throughout the LTE network there are multiple
connection points (UE to eNodeB, eNodeB to S-GW, etc.) that user traffic must traverse. In
order for user traffic to be allowed to traverse the LTE network multiple bearers must be
established. For a UE to have full network connectivity the following bearers must be established
in this order [29]:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Data Radio Bearer (DRB): Established between the UE and eNodeB on the Uu
interface. It allows direct user data communication between the UE and eNodeB.
S1 Bearer: Established between the eNodeB and the appropriate S-GW on the S1-U
interface.
E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearer (E-RAB): This is a combination of the DRB and S1
Bearer and creates a connection between the UE and S-GW.
S5/S8 Bearer: Established between S-GW and the appropriate P-GW for the user data
plane.
EPS Bearer: This is a combination of the E-RAB and the S5/S8 Bearer and provides
user plane connectivity from the UE to the appropriate P-GW.
External Bearer: Established between the P-GW and a resource external to the EPC that
the UE needs to access, such as connectivity to the internet.

Before a UE can join an LTE network and access voice and data services, it must go through a
procedure to identify itself to the LTE network. This process is known as the Initial Attach
Procedure and handles the communication of identifiable information from the UE to the LTE
EPC to ensure that the UE can access the network. If the process is successful, then the UE is
provided default connectivity, with any charging rules that are applicable and enforced by the
LTE network. The attach process is defined by TS 23.401 and is illustrated in Figure 5 below General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for E-UTRAN access [2].

580
581
582
583
584

The Initial Attach procedure begins with an attach request from the UE to the MME via the
eNodeB. This request includes the IMSI, tracking information, cryptographic parameters, NAS
sequencing number, and other information about the UE. The ATTACH REQUEST is sent as a
NAS message. The eNodeB then forwards the ATTACH REQUEST along with information
about the cell to which the UE is connected on to the MME. For each PDN that the UE connects
to, a default EPS bearer is established to enable the always-on IP connectivity for the users and
the UE during Network Attachment.

If there are specific Policy and Charging Control rules in the PCRF for a subscriber or device for
the default EPS bearer, they can be predefined in the P-GW and turned on in the attachment by
the P-GW itself. During attachment, one or more Dedicated Bearer Establishment procedures
may be launched to establish dedicated EPS bearer(s) for the specific UE. Also during the attach
procedure, IP address allocation may be requested by the UE. The MME obtains the IMEI from
the UE and checks it with an EIR (Equipment Identity Register), which may verify that this UE’s
IMEI is not blacklisted. The MME then passes the IMEI software version to the HSS and P-GW.
Once a UE has gone through the initial attach procedure it is assigned a GUTI by the MME. The
GUTI is stored in both the UE and the MME and should be used when possible instead of the
IMSI for future attach procedures for the specific UE.

discussion of LTE security goals is provided within [9] and an understanding of 3GPP’s rationale
for making certain security decisions and assumptions is recorded within [7]. The majority of
technical security requirements are available within the primary LTE security specification –
3GPP TS 33.401 – EPS Security Architecture [5].

In older 2G cellular systems, the cryptographic algorithms used to secure the air interface and
perform subscriber authentication functions were not publicly disclosed. The GSM algorithm
families pertinent to our discussion are A3, A5, and A8. A3 provides subscriber authentication,
A5 provides air interface confidentiality, and A8 is related to A3, in that it provides subscriber
authentication functions, but within the SIM card. UMTS introduced the first publicly disclosed
cryptographic algorithms used in commercial cellular systems. The terms UEA (UMTS
Encryption Algorithm) and UIA (UMTS Integrity Algorithm) are used within UMTS as broad
categories. UEA1 is a 128-bit block cipher called KASUMI, which is related to the Japanese
cipher MISTY. UIA1 is a message authentication code (MAC), also based on KASUMI. UEA2
is a stream cipher related to SNOW 3G, and UIA2 computes a MAC based on the same
algorithm [27]. LTE builds upon the lessons learned from deploying the 2G and 3G
cryptographic algorithms.

LTE introduced a new set of cryptographic algorithms and a significantly different key structure
than that of GSM and UMTS. There are 3 sets of cryptographic algorithms for both
confidentiality and integrity termed EPS Encryption Algorithms (EEA) and EPS Integrity
Algorithms (EIA). EEA1 and EIA1 are based on SNOW 3G, very similar to algorithms used in
UMTS. EEA2 and EIA2 are based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with EEA2
defined by AES in CTR mode (e.g., stream cipher) and EIA2 defined by AES-CMAC (Cipherbased MAC). EEA3 and EIA3 are both based on a Chinese cipher ZUC [5].

Many keys in LTE are 256-bits long, but in some current implementations only the 128 least
significant bits are used. The specification has allowed for a system-wide upgrade from 128-bit
to 256-bit keys. 1 In LTE, the control and user planes may use different algorithms and key sizes.
This diagram depicts the various keys alongside their use for an appropriate protocol.

The UICC is the next-generation Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card used in modern mobile
devices and is the foundation of the LTE security architecture. The UICC hosts the Universal
Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application that performs the full range of security critical
operations required of LTE cellular networks, such as authentication and other cryptographic
functions. The UICC is a tamper resistant removable storage device that users can leverage to
move their cellular service from one cellular device to another, while also providing the
capability of storing contacts and other user data. The UICC houses a processor, ROM, RAM, is
network aware, and is capable of running small Java applications used for a variety of functions
ranging from maintenance, updates, and even video games. The UICC can also potentially be
used for identity services and Near Field Communication (NFC).

From a security perspective, one of the most important functions of the UICC is cryptographic
key and credential storage. In LTE, UICCs are provisioned with a long-term, pre-shared
cryptographic key referred to as K. This key is stored within the tamper resistant UICC and also
within the core network (in the HSS) and is never to leave either of those locations [15]. All
other keys in LTE’s cryptographic structure are derived from K, with the session master key
referred to as K ASME . Security functions such as cryptographic operations and subscriber
authentication are performed by the UICC in conjunction with the HSS and MME, the UICC
also plays a role in storing LTE security contexts. Security contexts contain cryptographic keys,
UE security capabilities, and other security parameters generated during an attach that can be
reused during future system accesses. The UICC also stores the IMSI and IMEI, which are both
used to support the use of identities. Some modern mobile equipment operating systems
implement the USIM PIN specified by 3GPP TS 121.111 [31]. This allows a PIN to be
configured on a UICC. Since UICCs can be removed from one mobile device and inserted into
another to provide service, the UICC PIN can prevent someone from stealing another user’s
UICC and obtaining unauthorized network access that they are not paying for.

The primary LTE authentication mechanism mobile handsets used to authenticate to an LTE
network is known as the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol. The use of AKA
in LTE is required by 3GPP TS 33.401 [5]. The AKA protocol cryptographically proves that the
UICC and MNO have knowledge of the secret key K. From a security perspective, this
effectively authenticates the UICC to the network, but not the user or mobile device. An AKA
protocol run is depicted and further described below:

AKA is begun by a UE providing its identifier to the appropriate MME (item 1 above). This
identifier may be permanent, as is the case with the IMSI, or may be temporary. Examples of
temporary identifiers include the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) and Globally
Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI). After the identifier is provided to the core network, the
MME provides the identifier, alongside additional cryptographic parameters and the serving
network ID, to the HSS/AuC (item 2 above) these values then are used to generate an
authentication vector (AUTN). To compute an AUTN, the HSS/AuC needs to use a random
nonce (RAND), the secret key K, and a Sequence Number (SQN) as inputs to a cryptographic
function. This function produces two cryptographic parameters used in the derivation of future
cryptographic keys, alongside the expected result (XRES) and authentication token (AUTN)
(item 3 above). This authentication vector is passed back to the MME for storage (item 4 above).
In addition, the MME provides the AUTN and RAND to the UE, which is then passed to the
USIM application (item 5 above). The USIM sends AUTN, RAND, the secret key K, and its
SQN through the same cryptographic function used by the HSS/AuC (item 6 above). The result
is labeled as RES, which is sent back to the MME (item 7 above). If the XRES value is equal to
the RES value, authentication is successful and the UE is granted access to the network (item 8
above).

referred to as the air interface, which is referred to as the Uu interface. Both endpoints modulate
IP packets into an RF signal that is communicated over the air interface; these devices then
demodulate the RF signal into IP packets understandable by both the UE and EPC. The eNodeB
routes these packets through the EPC while the UE uses the IP packets to perform some function.
These radio waves are sent from a UE’s antenna over the air until they reach the antenna of the
eNodeB, this over the air communication is not necessarily private, meaning anything within the
wave path can intercept these radio raves. The figure below illustrates where in the network this
is occurring.

3GPP’s technical specification 33.401 directs that both the NAS and RRC control plane
messages must be integrity protected. 3GPP TS 33.401 5.1.4.1 requires that “Integrity protection,
and replay protection, shall be provided to NAS and RRC-signalling.” It is specified that user
plane packets traveling on the Uu interface are not integrity protected. Specifically, 3GPP TS
33.401 5.1.4.1 states “User plane packets between the eNodeB and the UE shall not be integrity
protected on the Uu interface.”
Both control plane and user plane packets communicating between the UE and eNodeB on the
Uu can be confidentiality protected but this is left as optional. This statement is based on a
requirement located in 3GPP TS 33.401 5.1.4.1: “User plane confidentiality protection shall be
done at PDCP layer and is an operator option”. Air interface confidentiality provides a higher
level of assurance that messages being sent over the air cannot be deciphered by an external
entity. LTE specifies a ciphering indicator feature in 3GPP TS 22.101 [6]; this feature is
designed to give the user visibility into the status of the access network encryption.
Unfortunately, this feature is not widely implemented in modern mobile phone operating
systems. Figure 9 and Figure 10 help to illustrate where on the network integrity and encryption
are provided by LTE.

An exact order is not specified for when the LTE network must negotiate security parameters for
a given connection. The TS 24.301 [10] permits the following 7 messages to be sent without
security protection:
• IDENTITY REQUEST (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);
• AUTHENTICATION REQUEST;
• AUTHENTICATION REJECT;
• ATTACH REJECT;
• DETACH ACCEPT (For non switch off);
• TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT;
• SERVICE REJECT.
Depending on network implementation these messages may be sent in a varying order. When a
message that requires protection needs to be sent the network must establish security parameters
and agree on algorithms. This establishment is initiated by the sending of the Security Mode
Command (SMC). The SMC dictates that the UE and serving network must initiate a
cryptographic algorithm negotiation in order to select appropriate algorithms for: RRC ciphering

network selects the algorithm based upon security capabilities of the UE and a configured list of
available security capabilities on the serving network.

The radio access network and associated interfaces make up the E-UTRAN portion of the LTE
network, and which is the midway between a handset and an MNO’s core network. Handover is
one of the most important functions of a cellular network, allowing the user the ability to be
moving, such as traveling on a highway, and maintain call connection. Base stations will often
need to communicate between themselves to enable this “mobility”, and they do so via the X2
interface. 3GPP specifies multiple security mechanisms to ensure a secure handoff of call related
information.

774
775
776

Two types of handovers exist: X2 handover and S1 handover. During an S1 handover the MME
is aware that a handover is going to occur before it happens. Within an X2 handover, the MME is
unaware and the transition occurs purely between eNodeBs via the X2 interface. There are
unique security considerations for both methods of handover. With an S1 handover, the MME
can refresh the cryptographic parameters used to protect the air interface before the connection is
severed. With an X2 handover, fresh keying material can only be provided after the handover for
use in the next handover.

780
781
782
783
784

When handover occurs, new keys are generated, partly separating the new session from the
previous one, although a new master session key (i.e., K ASME ) is not generated. The K eNB is used,
alongside other cryptographic parameters and the cell ID of the new eNodeB, to generate K eNB*,
which is used to protect the new session after handover occurs. It is of note that the source base
station and MME control key derivation and the new eNodeB is not meant have knowledge of
the keys used in the original eNodeB session.

3GPP has specified optional capabilities to provide confidentiality protection to various LTE

Separate Access Stratum (AS) and Non Access Stratum (NAS) level SMC procedures are
required to configure security on each applicable portion of the protocol stack. The AS SMC is
used for configuring RRC and user plane level protections, while the NAS SMC is used for
configuring NAS level protections.
Once an AKA run has occurred, and the NAS and optionally the AS SMCs are sent, a security
context is generated. A security context is a collection of session keys and parameters used to
protect either the NAS or AS. Long term information such as K, or other identifiers like the
IMEI and IMSI are not stored within a security context. Typically, only the keys from K ASME and
downward within the key hierarchy are stored. When a UE deregisters from an eNodeB, the
previous security context can be reused, avoiding a superfluous AKA run, which may add
network congestion and require additional computing power on behalf of the core network.

network interfaces. Section 3.4 discuses optional confidentiality protection provided between
UEs and eNodeBs on the Uu interface as well as communication between eNodeBs on the X2
interface. According to the LTE technical specifications 33.401, confidentiality protection is also
optional between eNodeBs and the Evolved Packet Core S1 interface. 3GPP specifies that the
use of IPsec in accordance with 3GPP TS 33.2103 NDS/IP should be implemented to provide
confidentiality on the S1 interface but the specification goes on to note that if the S1 interface is
trusted or physically protected, confidentiality protection is an operator option. Trusted or
physically protected is not further defined within the 3GPP specification.

The endpoints the S1 interface connects are very often many miles apart, meaning all data being
sent over the LTE network is traveling any number of miles from a cell tower location to the
facility where the EPC is located. The physical means to provide this backhaul connection can
vary, some technologies include; Microwave, Satellite, Ethernet, Underground Fiber, etc.
Physically protecting the S1 interface requires the MNO to have security controls in place at
every location through which this connection is routed. It is very likely the cellular MNO does
not own or operate the physical connection used to backhaul LTE network traffic, making it
difficult for the MNO to ensure the S1 interface is physically protected. The network operator
may depend on other network security measures (e.g., MPLS VPN, layer 2 VPN) to protect the
traffic traversing the S1 interface and ensure this interface is trusted.

An all IP-based system introduces certain security concerns that are not applicable to older
cellular networks. Prior to LTE if an adversary wanted to intercept traffic on a cellular network,
specialized hardware was required. With LTE the transport mechanism between the eNodeB and
the EPC is all IP, all that is required to intercept traffic is basic networking experience, computer,

3GPP TS 33.210 specifies, “For native IP-based protocols security shall be provided at the
network layer. The security protocols to be used at these network layer are the IETF defined
IPsec security protocols as specified in RFC-4301 and in RFC-2401”. 4 This 3GPP document
introduces the notion of Security Domains and using Security Gateways (SEG) or firewalls at the
edge of these domains in order to provide security. Security domains are “networks that are
managed by a single administrative authority” [3]. These are an important delineation of LTE
networks, however, they are ambiguously defined which can lead to different interpretations and
documentation for security domains. An example of this could be that all of the EPC components
and communication hosted in the same datacenter, with physical security controls provided by
the MNO. It could also mean that an MNO defines all components of the core as a single
security domain because the same administrative group manages them, even though they are
spread geographically throughout the country. Confidentiality is provided by initiating an IPsec
tunnel at the eNodeBs for traffic traveling over the (potentially not physically secure) S1
interface and terminating the tunnel at the security gateway placed at the edge of the Security
Domain where the EPC is hosted.

The use of IPsec on the S1 interface will require endpoints terminating the IPsec tunnel to be
provisioned with pre-shared keys or digital certificates. The use of a scalable system such as
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is likely to be utilized for a commercial LTE network. The
security parameters used to establish the encrypted connection can be dynamically negotiated
using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) based on policies configured at the endpoints. Both
endpoints of the IPsec tunnel (eNodeB & SEG) contain digital certificates or pre-shared keys,
provisioned either manually or dynamically from the PKI system. If digital certificates are not
pre-provisioned a Certificate Authority (CA) can be used to issue digital certificates and will

As previously mentioned, 3GPP has specified optional security capabilities for various
connections within LTE networks. However, even though 3GPP has noted in its standards that
since LTE has introduced an all IP-based network, there needs to be more focus on security of
the EPC than there was in 2G/3G there is no specific security guidance tailored for the EPC [3].
Although, traditional IP network security guidelines and operational procedures may be
beneficial. Since the core network handles the majority of control plane signaling, security needs
to be a primary consideration.

As specified in TS 33.210, the LTE network must be logically and physically divided into
different security domains. If any components of the core are in different security domains then
traffic between them is required to be routed through an SEG using IPsec for encryption and
integrity protection [3]. Due to the ambiguities associated with defining a security domain, an
operator’s core network may be considered one security domain. This implies a lack of security
on standard communication between core LTE network components. If this is the case, then all
of the signaling and user traffic being transmitted in the core would be transmitted in the clear,
without confidentiality protection. However, if different pieces of the core are defined to exist in
distinct security domains, then traffic must be encrypted using IPsec between them. To ensure
that user and control data is protected in the appropriate places in the core network, careful
consideration should be given to how security domains are defined for a network. Confidentiality
protection may be implemented between different components of the core to ensure that the user
and signalling traffic is protected.

Currently, 3GPP is working on standards for Security Assurance Methodology (SECAM) for
3GPP nodes. The main document, TR 33.805, "studies methodologies for specifying network
product security assurance and hardening requirements, with associated test cases when feasible,
of 3GPP network products" [8]. There are plans to have accompanying documents to TR 33.805
that will have specific security considerations for each component of the core. 3GPP will first
create the Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS) for the MME as a trial. Once the initial
SCAS is completed for the MME, the 3GPP SA3 working group will continue work on SCAS
for the other network product classes. The MME SCAS, TR 33.806, is currently still in draft and
addresses the security assurance specification for the MME. 3GPP is partnering with GSMA
Network Equipment Security Assurance Group (NESAG) to establish an accreditation process
and resolution process to evaluate products against the requirements defined in the SCAS.

873

Core network security does not have any rigorous security specifications or requirements in the
3GPP standards. Future development of SCAS may require specific security controls to be
implemented within the individual core components.

This section explores general classes of threats to LTE networks grouped by related threat
categories. It is of note that the 3GPP SA3 Working Group explored threats to LTE networks and
authored a document listing many of threats addressed in this section [7]. Threat analyses
external to 3GPP have been performed, such as [16], [17], and [18], and were used as input to
this analysis. Many of the threats listed below have been identified via academic research, while
others may be documented and reported real-world attacks that have occurred in deployed
cellular systems.

885
886

While some of these threats may have an impact on network availability and resiliency, others
are limited user data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, most of the threats mentioned
here would only affect a limited portion of the network. With increased availability of low cost
LTE hardware and software [21] many threats listed below can be implemented with a low level
of complexity [19] [25].

LTE infrastructure components (e.g., eNodeB, MME, S-GW) may run atop of commodity
hardware, firmware, and software, making it susceptible to publically known software flaws
pervasive in general purpose operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD and other *nix variants) or other
software applications. This implies that these systems need to be properly configured and
regularly patched to remediate known vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the National
Vulnerability Database [28]. The following subsections will address malware threats to specific
network components and the management of an LTE network.

Malicious code infecting a mobile device's operating system, other firmware, and installed
applications could prevent a UE from accessing a cellular network. Malware could directly
attack the baseband OS and its associated firmware. Attacking the baseband OS could change
important configuration files for accessing the network or prevent important routines from
running, such as those interpreting the signaling from a base station. Either of these would cause
a denial of service.

infrastructure. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack could be launched via a continuous
stream of attach requests, or requests for high bandwidth information and services, is one manner
of causing this attack. An unintentional DDoS attack on a carrier’s radio infrastructure has been
seen to occur via a mobile application making a large number of update requests [11]. Malware
can also compromise base station operating systems causing unexpected and undesirable
equipment behavior.

Operational and Access Management (OAM) networks are a vital part of an operational cellular
network, providing remote access into geographically spread out components of the network.
These OAM network interfaces provide quick access to network components, allowing MNOs to
manage and tune networks from one central location. Poor design and lack of hardening of these
management networks and interfaces create a serious security risk to the networks operational
stability. Unauthorized access to management interfaces can potentially allow malicious and
unintentional misconfigurations of critical network systems.

Rogue base stations are unlicensed base stations that are not owned and operated by an authentic
MNO. They broadcast a cellular network masquerading as a legitimate carrier network. The
necessary hardware to construct these devices can be inexpensively obtained using commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. The software required to operate a 2G (GSM) base station is
open source and freely available [20], and can be configured to operate as a rogue base station.

Rogue base stations exploit the fact that mobile handsets will attach to whichever base station is
broadcasting as its preferred carrier network and is transmitting at the highest power level.
Therefore, when a rogue base station is physically proximate to a mobile handset while
transmitting at very high power levels, the handset may attempt to connect to the malicious
network [23]. At the time of this writing, a large majority of rogue base stations broadcast a 2G
GSM cellular network. Unfortunately, the security protections offered by GSM lack mutual
authentication between the handset and cellular network, and strong cryptographic algorithms
with keys of sufficient length. Additionally, there is no requirement mandating that the 2G GSM
air interface is encrypted.

As previously stated, both the IMSI (UICC) and IMEI (handset) act as unique identifiers. Both of
these identifiers can be indicators of who owns a mobile handset and where a device is
physically located. It is commonplace today for individuals to constantly keep their mobile
devices physically near them, and if a rogue base station is used to intercept traffic in an area,
such as where you reside, the operator of the rogue network may be able to identify whether a
specific individual is, or is not, residing within a specific location. This poses a threat to privacy
because an eavesdropper can determine if the subscriber is in a given location. Data needed for
geolocation is available via signaling channels, and is sent over the air interface during handset
attach and authentication.

Using a rogue base station broadcasting at a high power level, an attacker can force a user to
downgrade to either GSM or UMTS. As of the time of this writing, there are no significant,
publically known weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms used to protect the confidentiality
and integrity of the UMTS air interface. Unfortunately, significant weaknesses exist for the 2G
GSM cryptographic algorithms used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the air
interface. Examples of broken 2G cryptographic algorithms are A5/1 and A5/2 [15]. Depending
on the algorithm negotiated while attaching to the rogue base station, the air interface
cryptographic algorithms chosen to protect the air interface may be cryptographically broken,
leading to a loss of call and data confidentiality.

Attackers using a rogue base station could prevent mobile devices physically close to the rogue
base station from accessing emergency services. This occurs when the rogue station fails to
forward user traffic onward to the MNO. If this attack occurs during an emergency situation, it
could prevent victims from receiving assistance from public safety services and first responders.
This attack may be detectable, since the UE believes it has cellular service but is unable to make
calls or send/receive data. This attack takes advantage of another vector that comes into play

while making emergency phone calls when the preferred network is not available. When making
an emergency phone call the UE might attach and attempt to send the call through a rouge base
station, even if the base station is not masquerading as a legitimate network. There is a risk that
the rogue base station will not forward the emergency call appropriately.

As stated in section 3.4, during the UE attach procedure certain messages can be sent before
security parameters are negotiated. One of these unauthenticated messages is the ATTACH
REJECT message, which prevents a UE from completing the attach procedure. A rogue base
station coercing a UE to participate in a UE attach procedure can send this unauthenticated
ATTACH REJECT message. In response to receiving this message, a UE will no longer attempt
to attach to this, or other LTE networks. Since the ATTACH REJECT message is sent even
before the UE can authenticate the network, it is unable to distinguish the rogue base station
from a real one. This can cause a DOS that may persist until a hard reboot of the UE is
performed. Certain baseband implementations will not automatically try to reconnect if this
ATTACH REJECT message is received [25].

990

Similarly, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message can be sent by a rogue base
station in the same manner, and may have the same effect as the ATTACH REJECT message.

A complex eavesdropping attack is possible if the operator does not encrypt user plane LTE
traffic on the Uu interface. Attackers would need to have the proper equipment to capture and
store the radio communication between UE and eNodeB. In addition, the attackers would need
software to identify the specific LTE frequencies and timeslots a UE is using to communicate so
they can demodulate the captured traffic into IP packets.

Femtocells offer a user the ability to have a small base station located within their house or other
area. These small base stations can assist with poor reception to an eNodeB, which may cause
slow, intermittent, or no access back to the core network. UEs attach to these devices like a
typical eNodeB, but these devices often connect back to the MNO’s core via a user’s home
internet connection through their Internet Service Provider (ISP). Femtocells have been
standardized in LTE since release 8, and are referred to as H(e)NodeBs, HeNodeBs, or HeNBs.
HeNBs are mandated to have an IPsec connection back to an HeNB gateway (HeNB-GW) to
protect traffic flowing into and out of a MNO’s core network [4].

If the HeNBs is within the physical possession of an attacker, this provides unlimited time to
identify a flaw on the HeNB. A compromised HeNBs can be used in a manner similar to a rogue
base station, but it also has access to the cryptographic keys used to protect the cellular
connection. They will provide attackers access to clear text traffic before it is sent back to the
core network. Common methods of attack exploit implementation flaws in the host OS and
drivers [14].

Jamming attacks are a method of interrupting access to cellular networks by exploiting the radio
frequency channel being used to transmit and receive information. Specifically, this attack occurs
by decreasing the signal to noise ratio by transmitting static and/or noise at high power levels
across a given frequency band. This classification of attack can be accomplished in a variety of
ways requiring a varying level of skill and access to specialized equipment. Jamming that targets
specific channels in the LTE spectrum and is timed specifically to avoid detection is often
referred to as smart jamming. Broadcasting noise on a large swath of RF frequencies is referred
to as dumb jamming.

A low cost, high complexity attack has been proposed to prevent the transmission of UE
signaling to an eNodeB. Research from Virginia Tech [12] and other institutions [13] suggests
that, due to the relatively small amount of LTE control signaling used by the LTE air interface
protocols, this attack is possible. Further research is required to ascertain the level of complexity,
severity, and probability of this attack succeeding.

Base stations may have physical (e.g., fiber optic) or wireless (e.g., microwave) links to other
base stations. These links are often used to perform call handoff operations. As mentioned in
section 4.5.1, it may be possible to jam the wireless connections eNodeBs use to communicate
with each other. Although theoretical, the same type of smart jamming attacks that are used
against the UE could be modified to target communicating eNodeBs, which would prevent the
transmission of eNodeB to eNodeB RF communication.

The 3GPP SA3 Working Group, the group that defines LTE security standards, states that this
attack “…can be made with special hardware and countermeasures for these are not feasible to
implement. However, jamming attacks may be detected and reported” [7]. This indicates that
these types of jamming attacks are outside of the LTE threat model.

The backhaul connection handles data communication between the LTE core and eNodeBs (cell
sites). In section 3.6 this document explores backhaul security and optional standards based
features to provide confidentiality on this critical interface. If the LTE network is not utilizing
confidentiality protection on the backhaul interface the communication being sent to and
received from cell sites is vulnerable to eavesdropping. It would be trivial to intercept
communication if a malicious actor had access to network equipment terminating the S1
interface.

The cell site is the physical location containing all of the equipment necessary to run and operate
an eNodeB. Although these sites sometimes are enclosed by a fence and protected by a physical
security system, it is possible for these defenses to be circumvented. A denial of service attack is

possible if the equipment used to run the eNodeB is taken offline or somehow destroyed. For
instance, copper theft is very common, which would result in a denial of serice. More subtle
attacks that are much more difficult to detect are also possible if an attacker can obtain gain
control of the systems running the eNodeB.

Cryptographic keys enable LTE to provide many of the strong security features built into the
system. As discussed in section 3.1, there are many different keys used to protect different layers
of LTE communication. All of these keys are derived from a secret pre shared key referred to as
‘K’. This key resides in two places: one is the USIM running on the UICC and the other is within
the carrier’s HSS/AuC. Depending on how K is provisioned to the UICC it may be possible for a
malicious actor to gain access to this secret key responsible for all of LTE’s cryptographic
functions. If an actor gains access to K they have the potential to both impersonate a subscriber
on the network and the ability to decrypt communication from the subscriber for whom K was
provisioned.

UICC cards are small cards that are removable from mobile devices by design. Service from an
MNO is tied to a user’s UICC. This means it is possible for a UICC to be stolen from one mobile
device, and placed into another with the goal of stealing service, including voice and data.
Another means of stealing service is if an insider with access to the HSS or PCRF grants
unapproved access to the network. For example, this could be an employee who activates UICCs
unbeknownst to the MNO and sells them for personal profit.

This section identifies mitigations to the threats identified in the previous section. It is of note

within Section 5, as there are unaddressed threats within this analysis. Each mitigation addresses
at least one threat listed in Section 4. It is of note that the 3GPP SA3 working group has explored
and authored a document detailing mitigations to many LTE threats listed in the previous section
[7].

Ensuring that many of the following mitigations are implemented in cellular networks is out of
the realm of possibility for everyday users, with the ability to enable change to be in the hands of
MNOs, mobile operating system developers, and hardware manufacturers. MNOs can work to
implement many of the mitigation techniques described in this section, however challenges may
exist where hardware, firmware, and software do not support these countermeasures. It is
important to work with the ecosystem in order to research, develop, and implement these security
features in commercial cellular equipment.

If these mitigations are important to a user, they may need to request these security protections
from the appropriate party. Many of the listed mitigations may simply be modifying certain
configurations of already implemented features, something that would be feasible in the near
term. Others would require software updates to mobile operating systems, and/or baseband
processors, or modifications to 3GPP standards, which will take much more time to implement.

LTE infrastructure components (e.g., eNodeB, MME, S-GW) rely on purpose built systems to
perform their network functions. The core software these systems run on is often a general
purpose operating system. It is important that computer security recommended practices,
including network, physical, and personnel security, be applied to these components in the same
way they are applied to general information technology systems throughout industry today.
Protection mechanisms such as patch management, configuration management, identity and
access management, malware detection, and intrusion detection and prevention systems can be
carefully planned and implemented throughout the MNO’s LTE infrastructure. These processes
and protection mechanisms can be tailored to best support and protect the specialized LTE
system.

Although integrity protection of NAS and RRC is mandatory, air interface encryption is left as
an operator option in LTE systems [5]. Enabling cryptographic protection of the user plane over
the Uu interface via the UP enc key can prevent passive eavesdropping attacks. It is possible that
implementing confidentiality protection on the air interface can introduce significant latency into
cellular networks, and it may also significantly impact a UE’s battery. Further testing, pilot
programs, capable hardware in conjunction with a phase approach can be followed to provide
confidentiality protection.

As discussed in 4.2, the authentication procedure for the 2G GSM system does not perform
mutual authentication between the mobile device and the base station. This allows for the
possibility of a non-LTE rogue base station to perform a downgrade attack on a UE with an
active LTE connection. This GSM connection may not be confidentiality protected. Current
mobile devices do not provide the option for a user to know if their UE’s connection is encrypted
to the eNodeB. 3GPP provides a mechanism to alert a user to an unencrypted connection,
referred to as the ciphering indicator.

1121
1122

The ciphering indicator is defined in 3GPP TS 22.101, which defines this indicator as a feature to
inform the user as to the status of the user plane confidentiality protection. This feature could be
implemented as a user interface notification appearing on the user’s mobile device and dose not
provide functionality to prevent a call from being made. It is possible for the MNO to disable this
feature with a setting in the USIM. 3GPP specifies the default behavior of the UE shall be to
obey the setting configured in the USIM. However, it is possible for the UE to provide a user
interface option to ignore the USIM setting and provide the user an indication of the status of the
user plane confidentiality protection. “Ciphering itself is unaffected by this feature, and the user
can choose how to proceed” [6].

1129

This indicator would be beneficial to informed users wishing to know if their over the air cellular
connection is encrypted or not. This may require new software from either the mobile
operating system vendor (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft) or the baseband manufacturer (e.g.,
Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung).

Rogue base stations often exploit the lack of mutual authentication that exists in GSM. Current
mobile devices do not provide average users the option to ensure that a user's mobile device only
connects to a 4G LTE network, a specific MNO’s (or MVNO’s) network, or a specific physical
cellular site. If users could ensure that their mobile device is connected only to a 4G LTE
network, mutual authentication is achieved between their UE and eNodeB via the LTE AKA
protocol, and an active rogue base station attack downgrading the connection to GSM should not
be possible.

It is of note that a preferred network technology listing exists on many UEs, and depending on
the platform, similar options may exist in testing modes, it is unclear if this option would prevent
a UE that is under attack from connecting to a rogue base station. The current functionality is not
intended to be a security feature but could provide vital defense against rogue base stations. The
user-defined option is not widely deployed in UEs, and would likely require software updates
from the mobile operating system vendor (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft) and/or the baseband
manufacturer (e.g., Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung). This option would be beneficial to informed
users wishing to only connect to LTE networks.

Both physical and logical security can be used to secure the backhaul connection of an LTE
network. Placing devices in physically secure location is an important step in securing the
backhaul connection and protecting it from malicious actors. Cryptographically securing the IP
traffic traversing the backhaul connection is seen as equally important and provides a higher
level of assurance and is possible via NDS/IP. Implementing confidentiality protection on the S1
interface may introduce latency into cellular backhaul connections, and further research is
required to understand if this latency would noticeably degrade service and traffic throughput.

To the extent that it does not significantly affect availability of network resources, the interfaces
between core network nodes can be confidentiality protected in some way, possibly via the
mechanisms defined in 3GPP TS 33.210. For instance, traffic between an S-GW and P-GW
should be encrypted. In the near future, many of the network components may be either
collocated on the same server as distinct applications or virtualized via Network Functions
Virtualization (NFV). 5 NFV will enable workloads running on the same physical hardware to be
logically separated, allowing communication between components to happen in software. This
would continue to separate each function’s processes but could possibly eliminate an exposed
physical interface. 3GPP and ETSI will provide forthcoming guidance for protecting these
interfaces.

As previously noted, some modern mobile equipment operating systems implement the USIM
PIN specified by 3GPP TS 121.111 [31]. This enables local user authentication to the USIM via
PIN configured on a UICC. Enabling the UICC PIN can prevent someone from stealing another
subscriber’s UICC and obtaining unauthorized network access. An individual stealing the UICC
and placing it into another device would be required to enter a PIN before they could continue
any further. Many UICCs lock after 10 incorrect attempts and the user’s MNO would be required
to provide an unlocking code to make the USIM usable again. The SIM/USIM PIN may degrade
the user experience by adding additional authentication and slowing down the UE boot process.

A subscriber’s permanent identity, the IMSI, is one of the first parameters sent to an eNodeB
when a UE attaches to the LTE network. IMSIs are sometimes sent in clear text over the air
interface, and this may be unavoidable in certain scenarios. 3GPP defines multiple temporary
identities that MNOs can leverage to avoid sending these sensitive identifiers over the air
interface, such as the GUTI in LTE. When the GUTI is in use, user tracking should become more

If an MNO is not encrypting a user’s traffic, or if a passive eavesdropping attack occurs, using a
3rd party over the top service can provide strong authentication, integrity and confidentiality
protection for user data. This mitigation would effectively use an MNO’s network as a “dumb
pipe”, and a user would use an application running on the general-purpose mobile operating
system to provide video, audio, or some other communication service. Additionally, 3rd party
over-the-top solutions can act as a defense in depth measure, choosing not to rely soley on their
MNO to provide confidentiality protection.

these systems exhibit when in the presence of unauthenticated reject messages. Additional
research and development is needed to ensure that baseband processors are exhibiting behavior
that does not cause unintentional DoS when receiving an illegitimate reject message.

When compared to previous cellular networks, the security capabilities provided by LTE are
markedly more robust. The additions of mutual authentication between the cellular network and
the UE, alongside the use of publically reviewed cryptographic algorithms with sufficiently large
key sizes are positive steps forward in improving the security of cellular networks. The enhanced
key separation introduced into the LTE cryptographic key hierarchy and the mandatory integrity
protection also help to raise the bar.

Yet LTE systems are rarely deployed in a standalone fashion - they coexist with previous cellular
infrastructure already in place. Older cellular systems continue to be utilized throughout many
different industries today, satisfying a variety of use cases. With this in mind, it’s easy to see
why LTE networks are often deployed in tandem with GSM and UMTS networks. This multigenerational deployment of cellular networks may lead to an overall decrease in cellular security.
A primary example of this is the requirement for the baseband firmware to remain backward
compatible, supporting legacy security configurations.

The interconnection of these technologies introduces additional complexity into an already
complicated system that is distributed over an immense geographic area, that is continental in
scale. Cellular networks traditionally use separate networks to communicate call signaling
information. Specifically, the SS7 network has been in use for decades and has its own unique
set of security challenges that is separate from the cellular network technology. An LTE-specific
version of Diameter was specified by 3GPP to, in part, resolve the challenges associated with the
use of SS7, although it is not widely deployed. It’s important for MNOs and all interested parties
to perform their own security analysis of this technology in order to understand how to
appropriately mitigate the risks introduced by these signaling technologies. This security analysis
should include how any partnering MNO also mitigates these risks in their own network, since a
weakness in one MNO’s network adversely affects the security of those its connected to.

LTE’s sole use of IP technology is a major differentiator from previous cellular networks. LTE
does not use circuit switching, instead opting to move to a purely packet switched system. IP is a
commoditized technology that is already understood by Information Technology practitioners,
which presents both challenges and opportunities. Attackers may be able to leverage existing
tools for exploiting IP-based networks to attack the LTE core and other associated cellular
infrastructure within an MNO’s network. Conversely, this may allow already existing IP-based
defensive technology to be immediately applied to LTE networks. Hopefully, the application of
these technologies will offer novel ways to increase system security.

Default Confidentiality Protection for User Traffic: The LTE standards do not provide
confidentiality protection for user traffic as the default system configuration. Enabling

would provide out of the box security to end users.

Prohibiting user traffic integrity: Although the LTE standards require integrity
protection for critical signaling traffic, integrity protection for user traffic is explicitly
prohibited, as stated in section 3.4.
Lack of protection against jamming attacks: This is an active area of research, and
mitigations have been proposed, although it is unclear if these mitigations have been
appropriately vetted and considered for inclusion into the LTE standard.
OAM Networks: Vulnerabilities potentially exist on the OAM network depending on
how it is architected and managed.

While this document is focused on the fundamentals of LTE and its security architecture, many
concepts were considered out of the scope of our analysis. Some of these concepts are services
that build on top of the LTE architecture, while others come from specific implementations and
uses of an LTE network. It is important that the security implications introduced by these
concepts listed below are well understood, and require further research:

coordinated effort between mobile OS vendors, baseband firmware developers, standards
organizations, mobile network operators, and end users. Developing solutions to the problems
identified here, and continuing to perform relevant research is an important task since LTE is the
