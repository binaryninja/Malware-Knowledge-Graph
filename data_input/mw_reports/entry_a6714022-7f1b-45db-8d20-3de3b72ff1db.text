Overview
Check Point Research (CPR) recently discovered malware on Google Play hidden in a fake
application that is capable of spreading itself via users’ WhatsApp messages. If the user
downloaded the fake application and unwittingly granted the malware the appropriate
permissions, the malware is capable of automatically replying to victim’s’ incoming WhatsApp
messages with a payload received from a command-and-control (C&C) server. This unique
method could have enabled threat actors to distribute phishing attacks, spread false
information or steal credentials and data from users’ WhatsApp accounts, and more.

General
As the mobile threat landscape evolves, threat actors are always seeking to develop new
techniques to evolve and successfully distribute malware. In this specific campaign, Check
Point’s researchers discovered a new and innovative malicious threat on the Google Play
1/9

app store which spreads itself via mobile users’ WhatsApp conversations, and can also send
further malicious content via automated replies to incoming WhatsApp messages.
Researchers found the malware hidden within an app on Google Play called ’FlixOnline.’”
The app is a fake service that claims to allow users to view Netflix content from all around
the world on their mobiles. However, instead of allowing the mobile user to view Netflix
content, the application is actually designed to monitor the user’s WhatsApp notifications,
and to send automatic replies to the user’s incoming messages using content that it receives
from a remote command and control (C&C) server.
The malware sends the following response to its victims, luring them with the offer of a free
Netflix service:
“2 Months of Netflix Premium Free at no cost For REASON OF QUARANTINE (CORONA
VIRUS)* Get 2 Months of Netflix Premium Free anywhere in the world for 60 days. Get it now
HERE https://bit[.]ly/3bDmzUw.”
Utilizing this technique, a threat actor could perform a wide range of malicious activities:
Spread further malware via malicious links
Stealing data from users’ WhatsApp accounts
Spreading fake or malicious messages to users’ WhatsApp contacts and groups (for
example, work-related groups)
Extort users by threatening to send sensitive WhatsApp data or conversations to all of
their contacts

Technical Analysis
When the application is downloaded from the Play Store and installed, the malware starts a
service that requests ‘Overlay’, ‘Battery Optimization Ignore’, and ‘Notification’ permissions.
The purpose behind obtaining these permissions is:
Overlay allows a malicious application to create new windows on top of other
applications. This is usually requested by malware to create a fake “Login” screen for
other apps, with the aim of stealing victim’s credentials.
Ignore Battery Optimizations stops the malware from being shut down by the device’s
battery optimization routine, even after it is idle for an extended period.
The most prominent permission is the Notification access, more specifically, the
Notification Listener service. Once enabled, this permission provides the malware with
access to all notifications related to messages sent to the device, and the ability to
automatically perform designated actions such as “dismiss” and “reply” to messages
received on the device.

Figure 2 – FlixOnline Permissions Request
After the permissions are granted, the malware displays a landing page it receives from the
C&C server and immediately hides its icon so the malware can’t be easily removed. This is
done by a service that periodically contacts the C&C and updates the malware’s
configuration accordingly.
The service can achieve these goals by using multiple methods. For instance, the service
can be triggered by the installation of the application and by an Alarm registered I the
BOOT_COMPLETED action, which is called after the device has completed the boot
process.

The response from the C&C contains a configuration with the following field:
Field

Purpose

landing_page

A URL to display to the victim after permission granting.

message_inbox

The message to send as a reply to all incoming messages.

message_limit

Unused, potentially could indicate as an “upper limit” for the amount of
messages to send out.

delay

Unused.

url

Unused.

delay_browser

Delay before showing popup with specific URL.

5/9

enable_browser

C&C check flag.

enable_webview

Indicates which app to use to open the URL.

webview_url

The URL for the WebView popup activity.

browser_url

URL for the browser popup.

Once this is complete, the malware has everything needed to distribute the payload. With the
OnNotificationPosted callback, the malware checks for the package name of the originated
application, and if that application is WhatsApp, it will process the notification.

Figure 5 – Check for WhatsApp notifications
First, the malware cancels the notification to hide it from the user and reads the title and
content of the notification received. Next, it searches for the component that is responsible
for inline replies, which is used to send out the reply using the payload received from the
C&C server.

Responsible disclosure
Check Point Research responsibly notified Google about the malicious application and the
details of its research, and Google quickly removed the application from the Play Store. Over
the course of 2 months, the “FlixOnline” app was downloaded approximately 500 times.

Conclusion
This wormable Android malware features innovative and dangerous new techniques for
spreading itself, and for manipulating or stealing data from trusted applications such as
WhatsApp. It highlights that users should be wary of download links or attachments that they
receive via WhatsApp or other messaging apps, even when they appear to come from
trusted contacts or messaging groups.
If a user was infected, they should remove the application from their device, and
change their passwords.
