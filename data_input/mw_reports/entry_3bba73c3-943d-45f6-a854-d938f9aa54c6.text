UPDATE (May 28, 2021, 1pm PT): Our teams have continued to investigate the latest wave
of phishing attacks launched by Nobelium. Based on what we currently know, the security
community should feel good about the collective work done to limit the damage done by this
wave of attacks. As we have notified our targeted customers and watched closely for other
reports, we are not seeing evidence of any significant number of compromised organizations
at this time. More importantly, antivirus services, like Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and
endpoint detection and response products, such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, are
identifying and protecting against the malware being used in this wave of attacks and are
working in combination with Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It is important for all users to
employ basic cybersecurity hygiene, including using multi-factor authentication, using
antivirus/antimalware software and being careful not to click on links in email, unless you can
confirm reliability to minimize the risk of being phished. We will continue to monitor the
situation.

This week we observed cyberattacks by the threat actor Nobelium targeting government
agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations. This wave of
attacks targeted approximately 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different
organizations. While organizations in the United States received the largest share of attacks,
targeted victims span at least 24 countries. At least a quarter of the targeted organizations
were involved in international development, humanitarian, and human rights work. Nobelium,
originating from Russia, is the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in
2020. These attacks appear to be a continuation of multiple efforts by Nobelium to target
government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts.
Nobelium launched this week’s attacks by gaining access to the Constant Contact account
of USAID. Constant Contact is a service used for email marketing. From there, the actor was
able to distribute phishing emails that looked authentic but included a link that, when
clicked, inserted a malicious file used to distribute a backdoor we call NativeZone. This
backdoor could enable a wide range of activities from stealing data to infecting other
computers on a network. You can read more about the technical aspects of these
attacks in this blog post from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC).
Many of the attacks targeting our customers were blocked automatically, and Windows
Defender is blocking the malware involved in this attack. We’re also in the process of
notifying all of our customers who have been targeted. We detected this attack and identified
victims through the ongoing work of the MSTIC team in tracking nation-state actors. We have
no reason to believe these attacks involve any exploit against or vulnerability in
Microsoft’s products or services.
These attacks are notable for three reasons.
First, when coupled with the attack on SolarWinds, it’s clear that part of Nobelium’s playbook
is to gain access to trusted technology providers and infect their customers. By piggybacking
on software updates and now mass email providers, Nobelium increases the chances
of collateral damage in espionage operations and undermines trust in the technology
ecosystem.
Second, perhaps unsurprisingly, Nobelium’s activities and that of similar actors tend to track
with issues of concern to the country from which they are operating. This
time Nobelium targeted many humanitarian and human rights organizations. At the height of
the Covid-19 pandemic, Russian actor Strontium targeted healthcare organizations involved
in vaccines. In 2019, Strontium targeted sporting and anti-doping organizations. And we’ve
previously disclosed activity by Strontium and other actors targeting major elections in the
U.S. and elsewhere. This is yet another example of how cyberattacks have become the tool
of choice for a growing number of nation-states to accomplish a wide variety of political
objectives, with the focus of these attacks by Nobelium on human rights and humanitarian
organizations.

Third, nation-state cyberattacks aren’t slowing. We need clear rules governing nation-state
conduct in cyberspace and clear expectations of the consequences for violation of those
rules. We must continue to rally around progress made by the Paris Call for Trust and
Security in Cyberspace, and more widely adopt the recommendations of the Cybersecurity
Tech Accord, and the CyberPeace Institute. But, we need to do more. Microsoft will continue
to work with willing governments and the private sector to advance the cause of digital
peace.
