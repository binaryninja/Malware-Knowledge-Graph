A decryptor for pyLocky Ransomware versions 1 and 2 has been released by French
authorities that allows victim to decrypt their files for free.
According to a post by the French Ministry of Interior, this decryptor was created in
collaboration between French law enforcement, the French Homeland Security Information
Technology and Systems Service, and volunteer researchers.
"This tool is a result of a collaboration among the agencies of the french Ministry of Interior,
including first the Brigade d’enquêtes sur les fraudes aux technologies de l’information
(BEFTI) of the Direction régionale de la police judiciaire de Paris, on the basis of technical
elements gathered during its investigations and the collaboration with volunteer
researchers. Those elements allowed the Service des technologies et des systèmes
d’information de la sécurité intérieure ST(SI)², part of the Gendarmerie nationale, to create
that software."
While pyLocky has not seen a wide distribution, the post by the French Ministry of Interior
states it is more active in Europe.

"PyLocky is very active in Europe and there are already many victims in France, both within
the professional environment (SMEs, large businesses, associations, etc.) as well as at
home."

Getting the pyLocky Decryptor
The pyLocky decryptor will decrypt files encrypted by version 1 and 2 of the ransomware.
Supported encrypted file extensions for version 1 are .lockedfile or .lockymap and version
2 is .locky.

Instructions on how to use the decryptor are included in the downloaded zip file or can be
read online.

Possible Command & Control server takeover
The pyLocker Ransomware utilizes Command & Control servers on the Tor network. These
Tor servers are provided in the ransom notes created on a victim's computer as shown
below.

pyLocky Ransom Note
Based on analysis by Michael Gillespie, the decryptor contains 2 hard coded private RSA
keys.
This could mean that French law enforcement or security researchers were able to gain
access to a command and control server and retrieve the master private encryption keys for
versions 1 and 2 of the ransomware.
It would also indicate that this is not a flaw in the encryption algorithm used by the
ransomware.
