APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our clients often ask us to assess the threat Russia poses in cyberspace. Russia has
long been a whispered frontrunner among capable nations for performing
sophisticated network operations. This perception is due in part to the Russian
government’s alleged involvement in the cyber attacks accompanying its invasion of
Georgia in 2008, as well as the rampant speculation that Moscow was behind a
major U.S. Department of Defense network compromise, also in 2008. These
rumored activities, combined with a dearth of hard evidence, have made Russia into
something of a phantom in cyberspace.
In this paper we discuss a threat group whose
malware is already fairly well-known in the
cybersecurity community. This group, unlike the
China-based threat actors we track, does not
appear to conduct widespread intellectual
property theft for economic gain. Nor have we
observed the group steal and profit from
financial account information.
The activity that we profile in this paper
appears to be the work of a skilled team of
developers and operators collecting intelligence
on defense and geopolitical issues – intelligence
that would only be useful to a government. We
believe that this is an advanced persistent
threat (APT) group engaged in espionage
against political and military targets including

1

the country of Georgia, Eastern European
governments and militaries, and European
security organizations since at least 2007.
They compile malware samples with Russian
language settings during working hours
consistent with the time zone of Russia’s major
cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg.
While we don’t have pictures of a building,
personas to reveal, or a government agency to
name, what we do have is evidence of longstanding, focused operations that indicate a
government sponsor – specifically, a
government based in Moscow.
We are tracking this group as APT28.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

KEY FINDINGS

APT28 targets insider information
related to governments, militaries, and
security organizations that would
likely benefit the Russian government.

GEORGIA

EASTERN EUROPE

SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS

APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence
about Georgia’s security and political
dynamics by targeting officials working
for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
the Ministry of Defense.

APT28 has demonstrated interest in
Eastern European governments and
security organizations. These victims
would provide the Russian government
with an ability to predict policymaker
intentions and gauge its ability to
influence public opinion.

APT28 appeared to target individuals
affiliated with European security
organizations and global multilateral
institutions. The Russian government
has long cited European security
organizations like NATO and the OSCE
as existential threats, particularly during
periods of increased tension in Europe.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

Malware compile times suggest
that APT28 developers have
consistently updated their tools
over the last seven years.

KEY FINDINGS

Since 2007, APT28 has systematically evolved its malware,
using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for
long-term use. The coding practices evident in the group’s
malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in
complicating reverse engineering efforts.
•

•

Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers
have consistently updated their tools over the last
seven years.
APT28 malware, in particular the family of modular
backdoors that we call CHOPSTICK, indicates
a formal code development environment. Such an
environment would almost certainly be required to
track and define the various modules that can be
included in the backdoor at compile time.

•

•

APT28 tailors implants for specific victim
environments. They steal data by configuring their
implants to send data out of the network using a victim
network’s mail server.
Several of APT28’s malware samples contain counteranalysis capabilities including runtime checks to
identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings
unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused
machine instructions to slow analysis.

Indicators in APT28’s malware suggest that the group consists of
Russian speakers operating during business hours in Russia’s major cities.
More than half of the malware samples with Portable
Executable (PE) resources that we have attributed to APT28
included Russian language settings (as opposed to neutral or
English settings), suggesting that a significant portion of
APT28 malware was compiled in a Russian language build
environment consistently over the course of six years (2007
to 2013).

5 fireeye.com

Over 96% of the malware samples we have attributed to APT28
were compiled between Monday and Friday. More than 89%
were compiled between 8AM and 6PM in the UTC+4 time zone,
which parallels the working hours in Moscow and St.
Petersburg. These samples had compile dates ranging from
mid-2007 to September 2014.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

Three themes in APT28’s targeting clearly
reflect areas of specific interest to an
Eastern European government, most likely
the Russian government.

APT28 TARGETING REFLECTS

RUSSIAN
INTERESTS
M

any of APT28’s targets align generally
with interests that are typical of any
government. However, three themes in
APT28’s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific
interest to an Eastern European government, most
likely the Russian government. These include the
Caucasus (especially the Georgian government),
Eastern European governments and militaries, and
specific security organizations.
APT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its
victims, a common tactic in which the threat group
crafts its emails to mention specific topics (lures)
relevant to recipients. This increases the
likelihood that recipients will believe that the
email is legitimate and will be interested in
opening the message, opening any attached files,
or clicking on a link in the body of the email. Since
spearphishing lures are tailored to the recipients

whose accounts APT28 hopes to breach, the
subjects of the lures provide clues as to APT28’s
targets and interests. For example, if the group’s
lures repeatedly refer to the Caucasus, then this
most likely indicates that APT28 is trying to gain
access to the accounts of individuals whose work
pertains to the Caucasus. Similarly, APT28’s practice
of registering domains that mimic those of legitimate
news, politics, or other websites indicates topics that
are relevant to APT28’s targets.
We identified three themes in APT28’s lures and
registered domains, which together are
particularly relevant to the Russian government.
In addition to these themes, we have seen APT28
target a range of political and military
organizations. We assess that the work of these
organizations serves nation state governments.

he Caucasus, a region that includes

the independent states of Georgia,
Armenia, and Azerbaijan, continues to experience
political unrest. The Georgian government’s
posture and ties to the West are a frequent
source of Moscow’s frustration, particularly after
the 2008 war. Overall, issues in the Caucasus
likely serve as focal points for Russian
intelligence collection efforts.

7 fireeye.com

Since 2011, APT28 has used lures written in
Georgian that are probably intended to target
Georgian government agencies or citizens.
APT28 is likely seeking information on Georgia’s
security and diplomatic postures. Specifically,
the group has targeted the Georgian Ministry of
Internal Affairs (MIA) and the Ministry of
Defense (MOD). We also observed efforts to
target a journalist working on issues in the
Caucasus and a controversial Chechen news site.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)

APT28 made at least two specific attempts to target
the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

APT28 Targeting of the Georgian
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)
The MIA harbors sensitive information about the
inner workings of Georgia’s security operations, the
country’s engagement in multilateral institutions,
and the government’s communications backbone. It
is responsible for3:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Policing, internal security, and border patrols
Counterintelligence
Counterterrorism
International relations
Defense of Georgia’s strategic facilities
and assets
“Operative-Technical” tasks

APT28 made at least two specific attempts to
target the MIA. In one case, we identified an
APT28 lure from mid-2013 that referenced
MIA-related topics and employed malware that
attempted to disguise its activity as legitimate
MIA email traffic. The lure consisted of a
weaponized Excel file that presented a decoy
document containing a list of Georgian driver’s

3
4

8 fireeye.com

license numbers. The backdoor attempted to
establish a connection to a Georgian MIA mail
server and communicate via MIA email addresses
ending with “@mia.ge.gov”. Once connected to the
mail server, APT28’s backdoor sent an email
message using a subject line related to driver’s
licenses (in Georgian), and attached a file
containing system reconnaissance information.
This tactic could allow APT28 to obtain data from
the MIA’s network through a less-monitored
route, limiting the MIA network security
department’s abilities to detect the traffic.
In the second example of MIA targeting, an APT28
lure used an information technology-themed decoy
document that included references to the Windows
domain “MIA Users\Ortachala…” (Figure 1).
This probably referred to the MIA facility in the
Ortachala district of Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital city.
The decoy document also contains metadata listing
“MIA” as the company name and “Beka Nozadze”4
as an author, a possible reference to a system
administrator in Tbilisi. The text of the document
purports to provide domain and user group setup

Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs website http://police.ge/en/home
Queries on the author yielded a LinkedIn page for a person of the same name who serves as a system administrator in Tbilisi.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

information for internal Windows XP and Windows
7 systems. APT28 possibly crafted this document
to appear legitimate to all MIA system users and
intended to breach the MIA network specifically
using the embedded malware.

APT28 Targeting of the Georgian
Ministry of Defense
APT28 also appeared to target Georgia’s MOD
along with a U.S. defense contractor that was

Figure 1: Georgian MIA-related decoy

training the Georgian military. APT28 used a lure
document that installed a SOURFACE downloader
(further discussed in the Malware section) and
contained a listing of birthdays for members of a
working group between the Georgian MOD and
the U.S. defense contractor. The U.S. contractor
was involved in a working group to advise the MOD
and Georgian Armed Forces, assess Georgia’s
military capabilities, and develop a military training
program for the country.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

Figure 2: Excerpt of APT28’s letter to a journalist writing on Caucasus-related issues

We wish our cooperation will be both profitable and trusted. Our aim in the Caucasian region is
to help people who struggle for their independence, liberty and human rights. We all know, that
world is often unfair and cruel, but all together we can make it better.
Send your articles on this email – in Russian or English, please. There are some difficulties with
Caucasian languages, but we’ll solve the problem pretty soon, I hope.

Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors
with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents,
spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting.

We believe that APT28’s targeting of the MOD
aligns with Russian threat perceptions. The
growing U.S.-Georgian military relationship has
been a source of angst for Russia. Georgia and
Russia severed diplomatic relations following the
Russia-Georgia War in 2008, and Georgia has
since sought to align itself more closely with
western security organizations. Additionally, in
June 2014, despite Russia’s vocal objections,
Georgia, along with Ukraine and Moldova, signed
association accords with the EU.5 This move
placed all three countries more firmly in the EU’s
political, economic, and security spheres of
influence. Georgian military security issues,
particularly with regard to U.S. cooperation and
NATO, provide a strong incentive for Russian
state-sponsored threat actors to steal information
that sheds light on these topics.

APT28 Targeting a Journalist Covering
the Caucasus
Another one of APT28’s lures appeared to target
a specific journalist covering issues in the
Caucasus region. In late 2013, APT28 used a lure
that contained a letter addressing a journalist by
his first name and claiming to originate from a
“Chief Coordinator” in Reason Magazine’s
“Caucasian Issues Department” - a division that
does not appear to exist.6 (Reason Magazine is a
US-based magazine) The letter welcomed the
individual as a contributor and requested topic
ideas and identification information in order to
establish him at the magazine. In the background,
the decoy document installed a SOURFACE
backdoor on the victim’s system.

We attempted to identify candidate journalists in the country. One of these was a Georgian national of Chechen descent, whose work appears to center on
Chechen and human rights issues. Ultimately, however, we cannot confirm the identity of the target(s).

The body of the letter suggests that APT28 actors
are able to read at least two languages – Russian
and English. The grammar of the letter also
indicates that English is not the author’s first
language, despite it purportedly originating from a
US-based magazine. This implies that Russian may
be the APT28 author’s preferred language.
Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its
sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion,
identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or
facilitate further targeting. Several other nation
states are suspected of targeting journalists and
dissidents to monitor their activity, including China
and Iran.7,8 Journalists in the Caucasus working on
Caucasus independence issues would be a prime
target for intelligence collection for Moscow.
Journalists critical of the Kremlin have long
been targets of surveillance and harassment,
and a number of governments and human
rights organizations have publicly criticized the
government for its treatment of journalists and its
increasing consolidation of control over the media.9

APT28’s Other Targets in the Caucasus
We have seen APT28 register at least two
domains mimicking the domains of legitimate
organizations in the Caucasus, as shown in the
table below. One APT28 domain imitated a key
Chechen-focused news website, while the other
appeared to target members of the Armenian
military by hosting a fake login page.
Of particular note, the Kavkaz Center is a
Chechen-run website designed to present an
alternative view to the long-running conflict
between Russia and Chechen separatists. In
200410 and 2013,11 Russia’s Foreign Minister
voiced his displeasure that a Swedish company
continues to host the Kavkaz Center website.

APT28 TARGETING OF

EASTERN EUROPEAN

E

astern European countries’ political and
military postures are traditionally core Russian
government interests. The Kremlin has long
regarded the former Soviet Republics and satellite
states as in its sphere of economic, political, and
military interest. Over the past two decades, as many
of these states joined NATO and the EU, Russia has
attempted to regain its influence in the region. Many
of APT28’s targets parallel this continued focus on
Eastern European governments and militaries.

In a late 2013 incident, a FireEye device
deployed at an Eastern European Ministry of
Foreign Affairs detected APT28 malware in
the client’s network.
More recently, in August 2014 APT28 used a
lure (Figure 3) about hostilities surrounding a
Malaysia Airlines flight downed in Ukraine in
a probable attempt to compromise the Polish
government. A SOURFACE sample employed
in the same Malaysia Airlines lure was
referenced by a Polish computer security
company in a blog post.12 The Polish security
company indicated that the sample was “sent
to the government,” presumably the Polish
government, given the company’s location
and visibility.

We have evidence that APT28 made at least two attempts
to compromise Eastern European government
organizations.
APT28 has registered domains similar to those of
legitimate Eastern European news sites and
governments, listed in Table 2. These domain
registrations not only suggest that APT28 is
interested in Eastern European political affairs,
but also that the group targets Eastern European
governments directly.
In addition, APT28 used one domain for command
and control sessions (baltichost[.]org) that was
themed after the Baltic Host exercises. Baltic Host
is a multinational logistics planning exercise, hosted
annually since 2009 by one of the three Baltic
States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all three of
which are on Russia’s border) on a rotational basis.
In June 2014, this event was integrated with a
larger U.S. Army training event, and focused on
exercises to improve interoperability with regional
allies and partners.13, 14

This domain registration suggests that APT28
sought to target individuals either participating in
the exercises or interested in Baltic military and
security matters. Such targets would potentially
provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and
strategic intelligence concerning regional military
capabilities and relationships. These exercises are
a particular point of interest in Moscow: proKremlin press cited Russia’s interpretation of
these military exercises and NATO’s involvement
as a “sign of aggression,” and Russia’s Foreign
Minister publicly stated that the exercise was “a
demonstration of hostile intention.”15

NATO AND OTHER
EUROPEAN SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS

A

PT28’s lures and domain registrations also
demonstrate their interest in NATO and
other European security organizations.
NATO remains a chief Russian adversary, or in the
words of Russia’s 2010 military doctrine, a “main
external military danger” particularly as it moves
“closer to the borders of the Russian Federation.”16
As the traditional western counterweight to the
Soviet Union, Russia regards NATO, particularly
NATO’s eastward expansion, as a threat to Russia’s
strategic stability. APT28 also registered a domain
name imitating the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an
intergovernmental organization that has cited
widespread fraud in numerous Russian state

elections. Insider information about NATO, the
OSCE and other security organizations would
inform Russian political and military policy.
Several of the domains APT28 registered imitated
NATO domain names, including those of NATO
Special Operations Headquarters and the NATO
Future Forces Exhibition. We also observed a user
that we suspect works for NATO HQ submit an
APT28 sample to VirusTotal, probably as a result
of receiving a suspicious email.

an APT28 lure containing a decoy document with a list
of British officers and U.S. and Canadian military
attachés in London.

which appears to be a professional organization of
defense attachés in Turkey.

APT28 Targets European
Defense Exhibitions
In addition to targeting European security
organizations and governments, it appears that
APT28 is targeting attendees of European
defense exhibitions. Some of the APT28registered domains imitated those of defense
events held in Europe, such as the Farnborough
Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY
2014, and the Counter Terror Expo. In September
2014, APT28 registered a domain (smigrouponline.co[.]uk) that appeared to mimic that for the

SMi Group, a company that plans events for the
“Defence, Security, Energy, Utilities, Finance and
Pharmaceutical sectors.” Among other events, the
SMi Group is currently planning a military satellite
communications event for November 2014.
Targeting organizations and professionals
involved in these defense events would likely
provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure
intelligence pertaining to new defense
technologies, as well as the victim organizations’
operations, communications, and future plans.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

Our analysis of some of the group’s more
commonly used tools indicates that APT28
has been systematically updating their
malware since 2007.

PT28’s tools are suggestive of the group’s
skills, ambitions, and identity. Our analysis
of some of the group’s more commonly
used tools indicates that APT28 has been
systematically updating their tools since 2007.
APT28 is most likely supported by a group of
developers creating tools intended for long-term
use and versatility, who make an effort to
obfuscate their activity. This suggests that APT28
receives direct ongoing financial and other
resources from a well-established organization,
most likely a nation state government. APT28’s
malware settings suggest that the developers
have done the majority of their work in a Russian
language build environment during Russian
business hours, which suggests that the Russian
government is APT28’s sponsor.

•

Some of APT28’s more commonly used tools are
the SOURFACE downloader, its second stage
backdoor EVILTOSS, and a modular family of
implants that we call CHOPSTICK.

•

•

SOURFACE: This downloader is typically
called Sofacy within the cyber security
community. However because we have
observed the name “Sofacy” used to refer to
APT28 malware generally (to include the
SOURFACE dropper, EVILTOSS,
CHOPSTICK, and the credential harvester
OLDBAIT), we are using the name
SOURFACE to precisely refer to a specific
downloader. This downloader obtains a
second-stage backdoor from a C2 server.
CORESHELL is an updated version of
SOURFACE.
EVILTOSS: This backdoor has been delivered
through the SOURFACE downloader to gain
system access for reconnaissance,
monitoring, credential theft, and shellcode
execution.
CHOPSTICK: This is a modular implant
compiled from a software framework that
provides tailored functionality and flexibility.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

A number of the malware variants that we profile
below, especially the CHOPSTICK family,
demonstrate formal coding practices indicative of
methodical, diligent programmers. The modularity
of CHOPSTICK alone, with its flexible and lasting
platform, demonstrates planning for long-term
use and versatility. We have also noted that
APT28 tailors implants to their target
environments, configuring them to use local
network resources such as email servers.

•

APT28 has attempted to obfuscate their code and
implement counter-analysis techniques:

•

•

One of the latest samples of CORESHELL
includes counter-reverse engineering tactics
via unused machine instructions. This would
hinder static analysis of CORESHELL behavior
by creating a large amount of unnecessary
noise in the disassembly.
A number of CORESHELL droppers also
conduct runtime checks, attempting to
determine if they are executing in an analysis
environment, and if so, they do not trigger
their payloads.
Many samples across the SOURFACE/
CORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, and EVILTOSS

malware families obfuscate strings that are
decoded at runtime. Two of the malware
families (SOURFACE/CORESHELL and
EVILTOSS) use the same decryption
sequence and similar algorithms for string
encoding and decoding. These families
encode their strings at compile time using a
custom stream cipher. From a high level,
these ciphers share a similar design across
the malware families but differ slightly in the
internal arithmetic operations.
APT28 has employed RSA encryption to
protect files and stolen information moved
from the victim’s network to the controller.

APT28 has made incremental and systematic
changes to the SOURFACE downloader and its
surrounding ecosystem since as early as 2007.
These changes indicate a long-standing and
dedicated development effort behind APT28. We
have observed samples of the SOURFACE
downloader compiled between 2007 and 2014.
We call SOURFACE (samples are frequently
named netids.dll) a first stage downloader
because its primary job is to retrieve a second
stage payload from a C2 server. Until 2013, the
SOURFACE downloader used hard-coded IP
addresses for C2 communications, whereas the
future CORESHELL samples use domains.

EVOLUTION OF
SOURFACE ECOSYSTEM

INDICATES SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT

WHAT IS A MALWARE ECOSYSTEM?
First, a malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant
amount of code with all of the others. There are exceptions: for example, some files
contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration
when making a family determination.
A malware ecosystem is a group of malware families that work together to perform
the same objective. Perhaps the simplest and most typical ecosystem
is a dropper and a backdoor that are used together. They may not share the
same code structure, but they are related because one drops and installs
the other.
The ecosystem surrounding the SOURFACE downloader frequently
consists of a dropper, which installs SOURFACE. The SOURFACE
downloader then receives another dropper from its C2 server, and
this second dropper installs a second stage backdoor, which is
usually EVILTOSS.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

In April 2013, based on compile time, the group
began to make significant alterations to the
SOURFACE downloader. They started by
changing the compiled DLL name to “coreshell.dll”
and making minor changes to the network
communications, as seen in Figure 7.

The hostname, volume serial number and OS
version data are encoded in the new URL format.
As seen in the table below, the SOURFACE/
CORESHELL developers also made other
modifications that changed the exported function
name and file size over time.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

In April 2013, based on compile time, the
group began to make significant alterations to
the SOURFACE downloader.

Figure 8: NATO-themed decoy
delivered with possible EVILTOSS
predecessor from 2004

Variants of the SOURFACE second stage
backdoor, EVILTOSS, share some code similarities
with SOURFACE. However, it contains more
capabilities, including the ability to provide access
to the file system and registry, enumerate network
resources, create processes, log keystrokes, access
stored credentials, and execute shellcode. The
backdoor encrypts data that it uploads with an RSA
public key. Many of its variants we have seen are
named netui.dll. EVILTOSS variants may use the
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send
stolen data in an attachment named “detaluri.
dat”. The backdoor attaches this file to a
preformatted email and sends it out through a
victim’s mail server.
23
24

23 fireeye.com

Interestingly, we found an antivirus report from
200423 detailing what appears to be an early
variant of EVILTOSS. The backdoor was installed
alongside the NATO-themed decoy document
depicted in Figure 8. The backdoor sent data via
SMTP to nato_smtp@mail[.]ru and received its
tasking via POP from nato_pop@mail[.]ru.
Although we have not conclusively attributed
this sample to APT28, it does suggest the
possibility that APT28 has been operating since
as early as 2004.24

http://ae.norton.com/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2004-081915-1004-99
Although the malware family and interest in NATO make it likely that APT28 was involved, we cannot conclusively attribute this sample to APT28 based on
these factors alone. We have no evidence that they controlled the C2 for this malware or were using EVILTOSS in 2004. APT28 could have possibly obtained
this source code from another group of actors. Also, malware can be passed from group to group. The other malware that we associate with APT28 in this
paper is more strongly attributed to the group using additional factors, some of which we mention in Appendix A.

MODULAR IMPLANTS

A modular development framework
suggests the group has had an organized
development effort since as early as 2007.

CHOPSTICK variants may move messages and
information using at least three methods:

2.

D

uring our research, we discovered that
APT28 uses a backdoor developed using a
modular framework. We call this
backdoor CHOPSTICK, a somewhat ironic name
that comes from our semi-random name
generator. The modular design allows flexible
options for compiling variants with different
capabilities as needed, as well as deploying
additional capabilities at runtime. This allows the
developers to make targeted implants, including
only the capabilities and protocols necessary for a
specific environment. Such a modular framework
suggests the group has had an organized
development effort since as early as 2007. A
formal development environment, in which code is
versioned and well-organized, would almost
certainly be required to track and define the
various modules that can be included in the
backdoor at compile time.

3.

Communications with a C2 server using
HTTP. These protocols are covered in more
detail in Appendix D.
Email sent through a specified mail server.
One CHOPSTICK v1 variant contained
modules and functions for collecting
keystroke logs, Microsoft Office documents,
and PGP files. The monitoring for new files of
interest is performed by a “Directory
Observer” module. In one sample this
information was intended to be sent via
SMTP using a Georgian MIA mail server. It
used one of four embedded sender email
addresses (@mia.gov.ge) to send files via
email to another email address on the same
mail server. All information required for the
email was hardcoded in the backdoor.
Local copying to defeat closed networks.
One variant of CHOPSTICK focuses on
apparent air gap / closed network capabilities
by routing messages between local
directories, the registry and USB drives.

uring our research into APT28’s malware,
we noted two details consistent across
malware samples. The first was that
APT28 had consistently compiled Russian language
settings into their malware. The second was that
malware compile times from 2007 to 2014
corresponded to normal business hours in the UTC
+ 4 time zone, which includes major Russian cities
such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Use of Russian and English Language
Settings in PE Resources
PE resources include language information that
can be helpful if a developer wants to show user

interface items in a specific language.25 Non-default
language settings packaged with PE resources are
dependent on the developer’s build environment.
Each PE resource includes a “locale” identifier with
a language ID “composed of a primary language
identifier indicating the language and a sublanguage
identifier indicating the country/region.”26
At the time of the writing of this paper, we had
identified 103 malware samples that were both
attributed to APT28 and contained PE resources.
Table 5 shows the locale identifiers27 with
associated language and country/region for
these samples.

The samples with Russian language settings were
compiled between late 2007 and late 2013, as
depicted in Figure 9. This consistency over a
long timeframe suggests that the developers of
APT28 malware were using a build environment

with Russian language settings at least some of
the time and made no effort to obscure this
detail. Overall, the locale IDs suggest that
APT28 developers can operate in both Russian
and English.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

CONCLUSION
We started researching APT28 based on activity
we observed on our clients’ networks, similar to
other targeted threat groups we have identified
over time. We assess that APT28 is most likely
sponsored by the Russian government. We
summarize our key observations about APT28 in
Figure 11 below.

APT28’s characteristics—their targeting, malware,
language, and working hours—have led us to
conclude that we are tracking a focused, longstanding espionage effort. Given the available
data, we assess that APT28’s work is sponsored
by the Russian government.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

APPENDIX A:
DISTINGUISHING
THREAT GROUPS

We use the term “threat group” to refer to actors
who work together to target and penetrate
networks of interest. These individuals may share
the same set of tasks, coordinate targets, and
share tools and methodology. They work together
to gain access to their targets and steal data.
The art of attributing disparate intrusion activities
to the same threat group is not always simple.
Different groups may use similar intrusion
methodologies and common tools, particularly
those that are widely available on the Internet,
such as pwdump, HTran, or Gh0st RAT. There may
be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing
of malware or exploits they have authored, or
even the sharing of personnel. Individual threat
actors may move between groups either
temporarily or permanently. A threat actor may
also be a private citizen who is hired by multiple
groups. Multiple groups, on occasion, compromise
the same target within the same timeframe.
Distinguishing one threat group from another is
possible with enough information, analytical
experience, and tools to piece it all together. We
can analyze multiple incidents and tell by the
evidence left behind that a given incident was the
result of one threat group and not another.

29 fireeye.com

Threat actors leave behind various forensic
details. They may send spear phishing emails from
a specific IP address or email address. Their emails
may contain certain patterns; files have specific
names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom
functions, and encryption algorithms. Their
backdoors may have command and control IP
addresses or domain names embedded. These are
just a few examples of the myriad of forensic
details that we consider when distinguishing one
threat group from another.
At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion
events are attributed to the same group when we
have collected enough indicators to show beyond
a reasonable doubt that the same actor or group
of actors were involved. We track all of the
indicators and significant linkages associated with
identified threat groups in a proprietary database
that comprises millions of nodes and linkages
between them. In this way, we can always go back
and answer “why” we associated cyber threat
activity with a particular group.

APPENDIX C:
SOURFACE/CORESHELL

SOURFACE is a downloader that obtains a second
stage backdoor from a C2 server. Over time the
downloader has evolved and the newer versions,
usually compiled with the DLL name ‘coreshell.dll’,
are distinct enough from the older versions that
we refer to it as SOURFACE/CORESHELL or
simply CORESHELL. This appendix focuses on
these newer versions.
CORESHELL uses two threads to communicate
with its C2 server. The first thread sends beacons
that contain the process listing of the
compromised host. The second thread is
responsible for downloading and executing stage

two payloads. Messages are sent using HTTP
POST requests whose bodies contain encrypted
and Base64 encoded data. The encryption
algorithm is a custom stream cipher using a
six-byte key. Commands from the controller to the
CORESHELL implant are encrypted using another
stream cipher but this time using an eight-byte
key. CORESHELL has used the same user agent
string (“MSIE 8.0”) that SOURFACE previously
used, but in more recent samples CORESHELL
uses the default Internet Explorer user agent
string obtained from the system. Figure 11 shows
an example POST request.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

When Base64 decoded, the POST content looks like this:
00000000 cd 77 ae 62 af ac ab 69 b5 6b 91 dc ab 20 b9 65 .w.b...i.k... .e
00000010 de b2 ac 2d 96 35 82 fd f3 d5 82 1e c7 bd a8 ee ...-.5..........
00000020 9c ee 9a 30 ac e5 21 e4 a6 ...0..!..

The key used to encrypt the message is six bytes long and is appended to the end of the message. In this is
example the key would be: 30 ac e5 21 e4 a6. When the message is decrypted, the resulting plaintext is:
00000000 00 72 68 64 6e 7a 78 64 66 6d 46 36 66 35 61 68 .rhdnzxdfmF6f5ah

requests. The command is identified by the NULL terminated UNICODE string “OK” (O\x00\K\x00\x00\
x00). The command is Base64 encoded and immediately follows the “OK” string. Figure 12 shows a
sample CORESHELL command:

Content-Length: 58
O.K...AQAAAKqqAQEBAQEBAQEVzPMEUUIzQtND8kOSRLVEVUV0RRRGN0bX

The Base64 decoded string is:
00000000 01 00 00 00 AA AA 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 10 41 ........ .......A

The implant supports the following four command identifiers from the controller as seen in Table 8. The
first byte of the command message specifies the command type and is immediately followed by the PE or
shellcode to be executed. In this example the command byte is 04 indicating the following bytes are
shellcode. If the command byte was 01, 02, or 03 the following bytes would be a DLL or EXE that would
be written to disk and executed.

APPENDIX D:
CHOPSTICK

CHOPSTICK is a backdoor that uses a modularized, object-oriented framework written in C++. This
framework allows for a diverse set of capabilities across malware variants sharing a common code base.
CHOPSTICK may communicate with external servers using SMTP or HTTP. This appendix documents
variants using HTTP communications.
The first time CHOPSTICK is executed, it may encrypt and store configuration data in the Registry key
HKU\S-1-5-19_Classes\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\{E6696105-E63E-4EF1-939E15DDD83B669A}\chnnl. The user HKU\S-1-5-19 corresponds to the LOCAL_SERVICE account SID.

The configuration block is encrypted using RC4 encryption. The key is a combination of a 50-byte static
key and a four-byte salt value randomly generated at runtime. The static key is derived from opcodes in
the backdoor.
CHOPSTICK collects detailed information from the host including the Windows version, CPU
architecture, Windows Firewall state, User Account Control (UAC) configuration settings on Windows
Vista and above and Internet Explorer settings. It also tests for the installation of specific security
products (Table 9) and applications (Table 10).

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

After collecting host information, CHOPSTICK creates a hidden file that may be named
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\edg6EF885E2.tmp for temporary storage and creates a Windows mailslot with the
name “check_mes_v5555”.28 Its usage of a Windows mailslot would potentially allow external binaries to
write data to the “check_mes_v5555” mailslot, possibly allowing CHOPSTICK to encrypt and store
output from other malware. It creates a thread that records user activity on the host, capturing desktop
screenshots in JPEG format, tracks current window focus, collects keystrokes, and scrapes window
contents (text, context menus, etc.). User activity is captured once every 500 milliseconds and logged in
an HTML-like format. The thread writes user activity log messages to the “check_mes_v5555” mailslot in
plain text. CHOPSTICK reads messages from the mailslot, encrypts them using RC4, and then stores the
encrypted message in an edg6EF885E2.tmp temporary file. The RC4 encryption used here also uses a 50byte static key plus four-byte random salt value.
After approximately 60 seconds of execution time, CHOPSTICK begins communicating with one of its C2
servers over HTTP. After sending an initial HTTP GET request it uploads the file contents of edg6EF885E2.
tmp to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests. It does not wait for a response from the server to begin
uploading. Once the contents of edg6EF885E2.tmp are uploaded, CHOPSTICK deletes the file. Figure 13
below contains an example of an HTTP POST request uploading a segment from edg6EF885E2.tmp.

A mailslot is a Windows inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism similar to a named pipe, but is designed for one-way communications between
processes and can also be used across the network.

APT 28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?

CHOPSTICK uses a URL-safe Base64 encoding, using an alphabet that substitutes “+” and “/” for “-” and
“_”, respectively. Each HTTP request contains multiple Base64 encoded URL parameters, however only
one parameter contains information encoded by the malware (“ai=”) and the rest of the URL parameters
appear to be randomly generated per request.
CHOPSTICK encrypts an 11-byte sequence in the “ai=” parameter. The purpose of this parameter
appears to be to uniquely identify the particular instance of the backdoor to the C2 server. The Base64
encoded text of this parameter begins with a number of randomly generated alphabetical characters
presumably intended to prevent people from Base64 decoding the whole string without some knowledge
of how the malware family works. The first four bytes of the message are an XOR key for the remainder of
the data. Once decrypted using the XOR key, an 11-byte sequence is revealed. The first seven bytes are
static, and are hard-coded in CHOPSTICK, while the last four bytes appear to be unique.
The message body of the POST request is also Base64 encoded. This encoded string is also prefixed with
random characters designed to break the output of a Base64 decode operation on the entire string. The
first 15 bytes of the decoded message body comprise another 11-byte sequence similar to the sequence
stored in the “ai=” parameter as described above. Decrypting these bytes yields another static seven-byte
sequence, followed by four unique bytes. The remainder of the message body consists of the RC4
encrypted data containing the HTML-formatted user activity log, edg6EF885E2.tmp.
After uploading edg6EF885E2.tmp, CHOPSTICK continues to query its C2 servers for commands using
HTTP GET requests. The malware contains code which allows it to load or memory-map external modules
that export the following functions: SendRawPacket, GetRawPacket, InitializeExp, DestroyExp,
IsActiveChannel, GetChannelInfo, SetChannelInfo, Run, GetModuleInfo, GiveMessage,
and TakeMessage.

Modularity
CHOPSTICK backdoors are compiled within a modularized development framework. This means that
two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors may contain vastly different functionality, depending on which
modules were included at compile time. The modules that are included in an instance of CHOPSTICK
may be reported to the C2 server as part of POST messages. Figure 14 includes an example from a
CHOPSTICK v1 variant:

To decode the POST content, the first step is to remove characters from the Base64 string (the number of
characters to remove may vary between different communication channels). In the example from Figure
14, the number of characters removed is seven. Once these characters are removed the decoded (but
still encrypted) text looks like this:
00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 5e 40 24 db 31 b5 40 53 r..”..3.^@$.1.@S
00000010 b9 91 d0 82 ba a4 d3 ab 6c 5a 05 ec 1a f4 3e 2f ........lZ....>/
00000020 ff d2 ed d2 7f 53 a1 df 4f c7 b9 fa 87 88 35 .....S..O.....5

The first two words (“72 11” and “fd 22”) are checksums that are used to validate the message. The next 4
bytes “f8 dc 33 9e” are a salt value that is appended to the end of an RC4 key. Once decrypted, the
message looks like the following:
00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 56 34 4d 47 4e 78 5a 57 r..”..3.V4MGNxZW
00000010 6c 76 63 6d 68 6a 4f 47 39 79 5a 51 3d 3c 3c ee lvcmhjOG9yZQ=<<.
00000020 01 00 00 01 00 23 01 10 23 01 11 23 01 13 23 .....#..#..#..#

The strings “V4MGNxZWlvcmhjOG9yZQ” and “=<<\xee” are hardcoded in the implant. The module
information starts at offset 0x20 with the string “01 00 00” and is formatted as follows:

The kernel IDs 0x0001 and 0x0002 indicate different versions. The corresponding modules in each
backdoor also are consistently identified with 0x01 and 0x02, respectively, in the second byte. In both
variants the modules with keystroke log, file system access, and command shell capabilities have the
consistent identifiers 0x10, 0x11, and 0x13, respectively, in the first byte. This suggests that the first byte
in the module ID identifies the module type whereas the second byte identifies the kernel version.
The kernel sends commands to each module using its module ID. The commands that each module
understands are likely consistent from build to build. Table 14 and Table 15 show examples of commands
that each module understands.

OLDBAIT handles APIs very similarly to SOURFACE and EVILTOSS. There is a setup routine that loads
the imports into a table and all API calls reference an index to this table. In SOURFACE and EVILTOSS the
table is stored in a global variable while in OLDBAIT this table is allocated at runtime and a pointer is
passed between functions.
