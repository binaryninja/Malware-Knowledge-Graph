Lookout Discovers Novel Confucius APT Android
Spyware Linked to India-Pakistan Conflict
lookout.com/blog/lookout-discovers-novel-confucius-apt-android-spyware-linked-to-india-pakistan-conflict

February 10, 2021
The Lookout Threat Intelligence team has discovered two novel Android surveillanceware
– Hornbill and SunBird. We believe with high confidence that these surveillance tools are
used by the advanced persistent threat group (APT) Confucius, which first appeared in
2013 as a state-sponsored, pro-India actor primarily pursuing Pakistani and other South
Asian targets.1 2
While primarily known for desktop malware, the Confucius group was previously
reported to have started leveraging mobile malware in 2017, with the Android
surveillanceware ChatSpy.3 However, our discovery of SunBird and Hornbill shows that
Confucius may have been spying on mobile users up to a year before it started using
ChatSpy.
Targets of these tools include personnel linked to Pakistan’s military, nuclear authorities,
and Indian election officials in Kashmir. Hornbill and SunBird have sophisticated
capabilities to exfiltrate SMS, encrypted messaging app content, and geolocation, among
other types of sensitive information.

SunBird has been disguised as applications that include:
Security services, such as the fictional “Google Security Framework”
Apps tied to specific locations (“Kashmir News”) or activities (“Falconry Connect”
and “Mania Soccer”)
Islam-related applications (“Quran Majeed”).
The majority of applications appear to target Muslim individuals.
Lookout named Hornbill after the Indian Grey Hornbill, which is the state bird of
Chandigarh and where the developers of Hornbill are located. SunBird’s name was
derived from the malicious services within the malware called “SunService” and the
sunbird is also native to India.

Malicious functionality and impact of both SunBird and Hornbill

Hornbill and SunBird have both similarities and differences in the way they operate on an
infected device. While SunBird features remote access trojan (RAT) functionality – a
malware that can execute commands on an infected device as directed by an attacker –
Hornbill is a discreet surveillance tool used to extract a selected set of data of interest to
its operator.
Both of the malware can exfiltrate a wide range of data, such as:
Call logs
Contacts
Device metadata including phone number, IMEI/Android ID, Model and
Manufacturer and Android version
Geolocation
Images stored on external storage
WhatsApp voice notes, if installed
Both malware are also able to perform the following actions on device:
Request device administrator privileges
Take screenshots, capturing whatever a victim is currently viewing on their device
Take photos with the device camera
Record environment and call audio
Scrape WhatsApp messages and contacts via accessibility services
Scrape WhatsApp notifications via accessibility services

SunBird-specific functionality
SunBird has a more extensive set of malicious capabilities than Hornbill. It attempts to
upload all data it has access to at regular intervals to its command and control (C2)
servers. Locally on the infected device, the data is collected in SQLite databases which are
then compressed into ZIP files as they are uploaded to C2 infrastructure.
SunBird can exfiltrate the following list of data, in addition to the list above:
List of installed applications
Browser history
Calendar information
BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) audio files, documents and images
WhatsApp Audio files, documents, databases, voice notes and images
Content sent and received via IMO instant messaging application
In addition to the list of actions above, SunBird can also perform the following actions:
Download attacker specified content from FTP shares
Run arbitrary commands as root, if possible
Scrape BBM messages and contacts via accessibility services

Scrape BBM notifications via accessibility services

Samples of SunBird have been found hosted on third-party app stores, indicating one possible
distribution mechanism. Considering many of these malware samples are trojanized – as in they
contain complete user functionality – social engineering may also play a part in convincing targets
to install the malware. No use of exploits was observed directly by Lookout researchers.

Hornbill-specific functionality
In contrast, Hornbill is more of a passive reconnaissance tool than SunBird. Not only
does it target a limited set of data, the malware only uploads data when it initially runs
and not at regular intervals like SunBird. After that, it only uploads changes in data to
keep mobile data and battery usage low. The upload occurs when data monitored by
Hornbill changes, such as when SMS, or WhatsApp notifications are received or calls are
made from the device.
Hornbill is keenly interested in the state of an infected device and closely monitors the
use of resources. For example, if the device is low on memory, it triggers the garbage
collector. In addition to the list of exfiltrated data mentioned earlier, Hornbill also collects
hardware information. For example, the malware can check if a device’s screen is locked,
the amount of available internal and external storage and whether WiFi and GPS are
enabled.
Hornbill only logs location information if it deems the changes to be significant enough
from the previously recorded location – if the difference between the corresponding
latitudes and longitudes differ by more than 0.0006 which is roughly 70 metres.

Data collected by Hornbill is stored in hidden folders on external storage. Once call
recordings or audio recordings are uploaded to C2 infrastructure they are deleted from
the device to avoid suspicion.

List of hidden folders Hornbill creates and stores data to be exfiltrated to C2 infrastructure.

Hornbill uses a unique set of server paths to communicate to C2 infrastructure. These are
listed below along with what action Hornbill takes when sending HTTP POST requests to
each.

The operators behind Hornbill are extremely interested in a user’s WhatsApp
communications. In addition to exfiltrating message content and sender information of
messages, Hornbill records WhatsApp calls by detecting an active call by abusing

Android’s accessibility services. The exploitation of Android’s accessibility services in this
manner is a trend we are observing frequently in Android surveillanceware. This enables
the threat actor to avoid the need for privilege escalation on a device.
Lastly, Hornbill searches for and monitors activity on any documents stored on external
storage with the following suffixes: ".doc", ".pdf", ".ppt", ".docx", ".xlsx", ".txt". Whenever
a document is created, opened, closed, modified, moved or deleted, this action is logged
by Hornbill. Functionality exists to modify this list of suffixes, but is incomplete in the
samples we have observed. The latest samples of Hornbill show that this malware threat
may still be under development.

Development timelines
The newest Hornbill sample was identified by Lookout’s app analysis engine as recently
as December 2020, suggesting the malware may still be active today. Both ChatSpy and
Hornbill’s packaging dates appeared to have been tampered with, but we first observed
them in January 2018 and May 2018 respectively.
Lookout first observed SunBird in January 2017, but unlike the other two malware
families, the packaging dates appear legitimate, indicating the malware was likely in
development between December 2016 and early 2019.

Hornbill, which Lookout first saw in May 2018, is actively deployed. We observed new samples as
recently as December 2020. The first SunBird sample was seen as early as 2017 and as late as
December 2019.

To better understand who SunBird may have been deployed against, we analyzed over
18GB of exfiltrated data that was publicly exposed from at least six insecurely configured
C2 servers. All data uploaded to the C2 infrastructure included the locale of the infected
devices. This information, combined with the data content, gave us extensive insight into
who was being targeted by this malware family and the kind of information the attackers
were after.
Some notable targets included an individual who applied for a position at the Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission, individuals with numerous contacts in the Pakistan Air
Force (PAF), as well as officers responsible for electoral rolls (Booth Level Officers)
located in the Pulwama district of Kashmir.

Based on the locale and country code information of infected devices and exfiltrated content, we
think SunBird may have roots as a commercial Android surveillanceware. The data included
information on victims in Europe and the United States, some of which appear to be targets of
spouseware or stalkerware. It also included data on Pakistani nationals in Pakistan, India and the
United Arab Emirates that we believe may be targeted by Confucius APT campaigns between 2018
and 2019.

Malware development and commercial surveillance roots
Both Hornbill and SunBird appear to be evolved versions of commercial Android
surveillance tooling. Hornbill seems to be derived from the same code base as a
previously active commercial surveillanceware product known as MobileSpy. 5 It is
unclear how the developers of Hornbill acquired the code, but the company behind
MobileSpy, Retina-X Studios, shut down their surveillance software products in May
2018 after being hacked twice. 6 Links between the Hornbill developers indicate they all
appear to have worked together at a number of Android and iOS app development

companies registered and operating in or near Chandigarh, Punjab, India. In 2017, one
developer claimed to be working at India’s Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO) on their LinkedIn profile.
SunBird looks to have been created by Indian developers who also produced another
commercial spyware product, which we dubbed BuzzOut. 7 The theory that SunBird’s
roots lay in stalkerware was also supported by the content found in the exfiltrated data we
uncovered. The data included information on stalkerware victims, as well as Pakistani
nationals living in Pakistan and traveling in the UAE and India. This data suggests that
SunBird could have been sold to an actor that selectively deployed it to gather intelligence
on targeted individuals. Similar behavior was observed with Stealth Mango and Tangelo,
two nation state mobile surveillanceware Lookout researchers discovered in 2018. 8

Exfiltrated data
During this investigation, we were able to access exfiltrated data for SunBird whose C2
infrastructure had been insufficiently secured.

This is a breakdown of types of data SunBird exfiltrated. This data is from publicly-accessible
exfiltrated content exposed on SunBird C2 servers for 5 campaigns between 2018 and 2019. We
found another 12 GB of data exfiltrated on another C2 server 23.82.19[.]250. The default language of
this server was set up as Chinese when discovered by Lookout researchers. This may be a false flag
or may have been altered by a third party. This also makes it difficult to confirm if all of the data
originated from infections of actual target devices.

Frequency of infected devices’ locale and country code settings (translated to languages and
countries) as packaged within publicly-accessible exfiltrated data. This data includes both the
Confucius APT targets and spouseware victims of SunBird.

Left:One particular SunBird C2 server was found to also be exposing a log file containing IP
addresses of those that logged into the administrator panel. The majority of these were distributed
throughout India. Right: Geo-location data captured from a publicly-exposed database found on
another Sunbird C2 IP 23.82.19[.]250. Almost all data stored on this server referenced phone
numbers of various locations in northern India. The second most common region for phone numbers
was Pakistan.

Within the exfiltrated data, one particular victim caught our interest. This individual was
using WhatsApp to correspond with someone applying for a position at the Pakistan
Nuclear Regulatory Authority in 2017. In 2018, messages were uncovered from someone
applying for a position at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.9
Additional exfiltrated data from late 2018 and early 2019 indicated that SunBird was
being used to monitor Booth Level Officers10 responsible for field-level information
regarding electoral rolls in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. This time and location is

significant as Pulwama suffered a suicide bombing attack in February 2019, which
increased tensions between India and Pakistan. The start date of active monitoring of this
target on C2 servers coincided with the start of the Indian general elections held in April
2019.

Continuous data exfiltration data that occurred every ten minutes stopped at the end of
2018. Aside from one brief upload in January 2019, it suddenly picked up again on the
11th of April 2019. While this may be coincidence, this is also the same day that the
Indian general elections of 2019 began.12
A total of 156 victims were discovered in this new dataset and included phone numbers
from India, Pakistan and Kazakhstan.

Confucius connection

Hornbill application icons impersonate various chat and system applications.

Similar to previous Confucius tactics seen with ChatSpy, Hornbill samples often
impersonate chat applications such as Fruit Chat, Cucu Chat and Kako Chat. The related
C2 infrastructure communicates on port 8080, a pattern also seen on the desktop
campaigns carried out by Confucius.14
The Confucius group is well known for impersonating legitimate services to cover their
tracks and confuse its victims. Naming malicious apps similar to legitimate ones may be
an attempt to gain a target’s trust. For example, “kako chat” may have been named due to
its similarity to KakaoTalk.15 However, Kako Chat’s C2 server
(chatk.goldenbirdcoin[.]com) references a defunct cryptocurrency by the same name.16
Cucu Chat may refer to a seemingly benign dating app of the same name that is available
on third-party app stores such as APKPure.17, 18 However, Cucu Chat communicates to
the site http://wangu[.]xyz19 (also on port 8080) and itself appears to be an

impersonation of Wangu, an application which advertises itself as a chat app for
Zimbabweans.20 The latest sample of Hornbill titled “Filos” trojanizes the Mesibo21
Android application for legitimate chat functionality.
During our investigation, we noticed that Hornbill C2 infrastructure hosted HTML
resources consistent with a commercial spyware page, but missing its image resources.

C2 servers for Hornbill were found to host HTML content from a commercial spyware.

Additionally, Hornbill carries out data exfiltration via the following unique set of
server paths:

We found that the patterns noted above also existed on another domain samaatv[.]online.
Although Lookout has not directly observed an APK communicating to this domain, we
think one likely exists. samaatv[.]online has resolved to the IP address 91.210.107[.]104
since May 2019, which encompasses the activity of this campaign.

In addition to this, we found the SunBird C2 domain pieupdate[.]online resolved to
91.210.107.111 in between February 2019 and July 2019. This is also the timeframe in
which we observed active campaigns by SunBird on that infrastructure.
With the help of public reporting and Lookout’s dataset, we are confident that the
Confucius APT group is actively using the IPs between 91.210.107[.]103-91.210.107[.]112
to host a large portion of their infrastructure, both presently and in the past.
Additional open-source intelligence (OSINT) searches confirmed the above connections.
We found a publicly-accessible 2018 Pakistani government advisory warning of a desktop
malware campaign targeting officers and government staff. The campaign described in it
used phishing emails that impersonated various government agencies to deliver malicious
Microsoft Word exploits. The Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this campaign
included domains that were known Confucius infrastructure, leading us to believe the
entire campaign could be attributed to that group.

Official Report from Pakistan’s Federal Bureau of Revenue on Malicious Activity.

A particular point of interest on the advisory IoC list, and crucial in confirming Confucius
connections, was pieupdate[.]online, a C2 server for malicious desktop activity as well as
SunBird mobile malware.

Hornbill malware has unique file paths with which to communicate with C2 servers. They also
display a unique Spyware HTML page. Lookout researchers uncovered another domain,
samaatv[.]online, which shares the same unique file paths and Spyware HTML page found on a
Hornbill C2 server, cucuchat[.]com. It is tied to known Confucius infrastructure by resolving to
91.210.107[.]104, in the Confucius IP range.

We are confident SunBird and Hornbill are two tools used by the same actor, perhaps for
different surveillance purposes.
