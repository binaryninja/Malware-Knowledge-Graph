APT-C-56
Transparent Tribe
APT-C-56 (Transparent Tribe), also known as Transparent Tribe, APT36, ProjectM, C-Major,
is an APT organization with a South Asian background, which has long targeted attacks on
the politics and military of neighboring countries and regions (especially India), and has
developed its own exclusive Trojan horse CrimsonRAT, and has also been found to widely
spread USB worms.
It has been targeting India's government, public sector, and various industries including but
not limited to healthcare, power, finance, manufacturing, etc. to maintain a high level of
information theft activities.
Earlier this year, Transparent Tribe and SideCopy were found to be using the same
infrastructure and using the same themes to target similar targets, using smuggling
intelligence-related decoys to camouflage Indian Defense Ministry emails to launch frequent
attacks against India. We also found an attack campaign targeting the foreign trade industry
using backlinks.
Recently, the 360 Advanced Threat Institute detected a sample of suspected Transparent
Tribe's attack activity. We speculate that the previous operation went undetected, and the
sample used the bait documentation to eventually release its exclusive Trojan, CrimsonRAT.

1. Analysis of attack activities
1. Attack process analysis
Attack campaigns using decoy documents that disguise resumes. Through the release of
CrimsonRAT through Dropper, continuous monitoring of users in the middle of the
recruitment.

2. Load delivery analysis

1/14

2.1 Disguising Documents
The sample name we captured is Sonam kaur_2, the
document name is similar to the sample, the file name
below is Sonam Singh's document, which also uses the
name of the person as the document name, and Sonam
Singh's document is a personal work resume.
Unlike the same attack we speculate is that the malicious
document we capture only contains macro code inside
the open window, and once the user inadvertently clicks
to start the macro function, the hidden malicious macro
code runs automatically.

We also found an account with the same name on Twitter, and in the profile we can see that
the status location is in Mumbai and is a wealth consulting firm. The Tweet update is as of
July 2021, and while this is consistent with our presumed timing of the action, it is not
possible to tell if this tweet is related to the documentation.

2/14

The macro code disguises itself as an Mdiaz-related program in the ALLUSERSPROFILE
directory, reads hidden data from the specified structure of the malicious document and
writes it to a file, which shows that APT-C-56 (transparent tribe) uses simple string
concatenation technology to disassemble exe characters to avoid static killing by antivirus
engines.

3/14

Launch the malicious PE program that is released, while further reading the normal text
document data hidden inside, release it to the worddcs.docx, and finally open this document
to disguise and confuse the user.

4/14

2.2 Dropper
The released PE file is a .Net Dropper program. First, determine whether a zip file exists,
read the resource section and write the data to the file if it does not exist, delete it and write it
again.

5/14

Determine whether there is a file with the suffix .ford in the directory, and if so, create a
startup file directly. If no suffix is specified, the file goes directly to the subsequent release
process.

6/14

Then determine whether there is a backdoor RAT stored in the resource, and if not,
download and run it from the C&C through the network connection.

3. Attack component analysis
The RAT backdoor released after download disguises itself as the FireFox browser and is the
CrimsonRAT that the Transparent Tribe has been maintaining and using.

2. Attribution research and judgment
Based on the similarity of the macro code and CrimsonRAT judging that this is an APT-C-5 6
(Transparent Tribe) attack activity, the sample found this time has many similarities to our
previous APT-C-56 (Transparent Tribe) attack analysis report.

1. Analysis related to previous attacks
1.1 Macro code is similar
The following figure shows the analysis from the previous disclosure action:

1.2 Dropper is similar

2. Difference analysis from previous actions
The last campaign released RATs directly from resources.

12/14

The samples found this time were downloaded via a network connection for subsequent
RATs.

summary
The India-Pakistan conflict has always existed because of border, cultural, ethnic, historical
and other reasons, and the military and political espionage caused by geopolitical conflicts
has always been the main theme of the region. Pakistan's sidecopy group has been imitating

13/14

the Sidewinder attack, and the Indian group will also imitate the transparent tribe's attack.
Chaotic situations often represent a contest of economic, military, and cybersecurity
capabilities between countries, and it is increasingly important to seize intelligence
opportunities through cyberattacks and maintain national security.
