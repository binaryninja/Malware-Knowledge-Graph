BlackByte

By Trend Micro Research
BlackByte is a ransomware group that has been building a name for itself since 2021. Like its contemporaries, it has gone after critical
infrastructure for a higher chance of a getting a payout. What techniques set it apart?

1/11

BlackByte debuted in July 2021. Its first year of activity garnered the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Secret
Service (USS). According to a joint advisory by these two government agencies, BlackByte had already gone after at least three US critical
infrastructure sectors (government facilities, financial, and food and agriculture) by November 2021.
This advisory shows just how BlackByte was actively establishing itself as a new noteworthy ransomware variant. On October 2021, Trustwave
released a publicly available decrypter for BlackByte. This however did not stop BlackByte as developers released newer versions that used
multiple keys and ramped up operations, going as far as to warn their victims against using the available decrypter on their website.
BlackByte’s emergence could be part of a larger scheme. With the purported shut down of Conti, researchers from AdvIntel surmise that
BlackByte is one of the chief new ransomware variants part of its rebranding.
At present, BlackByte continues to target organizations from all over the world. However, like LockBit, RansomEXX, and many other
ransomware families, BlackByte avoids attacking Russia-based entities.

What do organizations need to know about BlackByte?

While BlackByte operators use their piece of ransomware in attacks for their own gain, they also run on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
model for their affiliates. We have listed down the key highlights of BlackByte here:
Initial versions used symmetric keys. The earlier variant of BlackByte used the same key in each campaign to encrypt files. It also
used AES, a symmetric key algorithm. This allowed researchers to create a decrypter to help BlackByte victims, thus forcing the group to
change their encryption method in newer variants.
It has multiple variants. The first known version of BlackByte was written in C#. Operators then released two Go-based variants. The
more recent Go-variant was introduced around February 2022 and sported modifications particularly in its encryption algorithm.
Archives files using WinRAR. In BlackByte campaigns data exfiltration is done before the ransomware is deployed. This is because the
BlackByte ransomware is incapable of exfiltrating data, instead it archives files using WinRAR then uploads the file to sharing sites.
Uses trojanized legitimate tools. Like most modern ransomware variants, BlackByte uses living-off-the-land binaries. For example, it
uses the remote tool AnyDesk to gain further control over a system and for lateral movement.
Involves phishing emails or a known ProxyShell vulnerability for initial access. BlackByte has been known to use phishing emails
or exploit unpatched ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Servers to gain initial access into a system.
BlackByte trajectory seems to point to continuing activity. In fact, reports indicate that BlackByte is among the ransomware operations that
have set their sights on Latin American governments in May 2022. This report is reflected in our own telemetry data as seen in the next
section.

Top affected industries and countries
The data used in this section represent the count of unique machines where BlackByte-related activity had been detected. Based on our
telemetry data, BlackByte showed a fairly consistent level of activity from October 2021 to March 2022. However, May 2022 detections showed
a drastic uptick in number.

Based on our telemetry data from April 30, 2021 to May 31, 2022, we detected BlackByte activity all over the globe. However, after the spike in
activity in May, Peru outstripped other countries in detection. This is consistent with the reported escalation of ransomware attacks in Latin
America, where BlackByte was also reportedly among those that targeted the region.

Up to the end of April 2022, the technology sector saw the most BlackByte detections, however, in May, detections in the government sector
also shot up.

One way to interpret these observations is that the drastic increase stemmed from a single attack that affected several machines. Aside from
the reports on ransomware groups targeting Latin America, this explanation is also based on the report that, by their own claim, BlackByte
operators had compromised a Peruvian government entity around the time of the increased activity.

Targeted regions and sectors according to BlackByte leaksite
In addition to these detections, we delved into BlackByte’s leak site to see the number of attacks recorded there. We looked at data from
August 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022. Based on what we found in the site, BlackByte’s victims were composed mostly of small size businesses. The
activity peaked in November 2021.
Overall, the leak site has yet to reflect the focused attack on Latin American governments. The distribution of their attacks per region showed,
instead, a proclivity for targeting entities based in North America and Europe.

Figure 4. Regional distribution of BlackByte victims according to the group’s leak site (August 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022)
Based on the leak site data alone, BlackByte operators and their affiliates have yet to show a marked interest in any one sector. We found a
relatively even distribution of attacks across industries, which included the following:
Construction
Materials
Healthcare
Retail
Transportation
Energy & Utilities
Manufacturing
Professional services
Automobile
Community
Foods & Staples
Real Estate
Government
IT
Legal services
Media and entertainment
Comparing the leak site data of BlackByte to other ransomware families, shows that from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022, BlackByte was
among the 10 ransomware groups with the greatest number of self-reported victims.

Figure 5. Top ransomware groups with the greatest number of listed victims in their respective leak sites (January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022)
The data seems to show that BlackByte's operation is beginning to build a name for itself in the threat landscape while still building
momentum. The following section shows how it works and how it conducts its attacks.

Infection chain and techniques
Given that BlackByte operates on the RaaS model, its infection chain can vary depending on the target.

4/11

Figure 6. BlackByte infection chain

Initial Access
BlackByte can arrive in a system by exploiting the ProxyShell vulnerabilities. Exploiting the vulnerable server allows the attacker to create
a web shell to the system which is then used to download and drop Cobeacon using Certutil.
After the initial access into the system, the attackers use Certutil to download and execute the components that it needs to propagate in
the network.
After the deployment of Cobeacon, it is then used to execute BlackByte ransomware.

Discovery and Lateral Movement
Based on our data, the actors used NetScan as a network discovery tool that allows the attackers to get a good view of the victim’s
network environment.
After network reconnaissance, the attackers deploy AnyDesk in the system for an additional level of control over the system. The
attackers repeat this process of discovery and deployment of Cobeacon and AnyDesk until it achieves its goals.
During the execution of BlackByte, it terminates certain processes and services related to security application to evade detection.

Exfiltration
Once the attackers have sufficiently infiltrated into the victim’s network and identified valuable files, it exfiltrates them using WinRar to
archive the files and upload them into file sharing sites such as anonymfiles[.]com and file[.]io.

Impact

5/11

Once the ransomware is executed, it terminates certain services and processes related to security application to evade detections. It also
connects to its C&C server where it looks for a certain PNG file that contains information critical to encryption and is used to derive the
AES128 key. This key is then protected using an embedded RSA key which will then become undecryptable without the private key. The
ransomware then deletes shadow copies in the system using vssadmin.

Recommendations
Organizations face both established ransomware families as well as newer variants that are just entering the fray. Like many newer
ransomware families, BlackByte is readying itself to take the spot of any big-game ransomware operation in decline. However, underneath it all
could be a more intricate scheme of threat groups dispersing under new monikers.
As with the case of BlackByte, knowing its notable tactics, while also staying knowledgeable of bigger trends can help organizations create an
effective strategy for ransomware attacks. In the case of BlackByte, prevention is key by keeping employees wary of phishing tactics and
keeping up with security patches such as those for ProxyShell vulnerabilities.
To help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can allocate resources systematically for
establishing solid defenses against ransomware.
Here are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:

Audit and inventory
Take an inventory of assets and data
Identify authorized and unauthorized devices and software
Make an audit of event and incident logs

Configure and monitor
Manage hardware and software configurations
Grant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role
Monitor network ports, protocols, and services
Activate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers
Establish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications

Patch and update
Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
Perform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications
Update software and applications to their latest versions

Protect and recover

10/11

Implement data protection, back up, and recovery measures
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA)

Secure and defend
Employ sandbox analysis to block malicious emails
Deploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network
Detect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system
Use advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning

Train and test
Regularly train and assess employees' security skills
Conduct red-team exercises and penetration tests
