Abstract
CryptoCore is an attack campaign against crypto-exchange companies that has been ongoing for three
years and was discovered by ClearSky researchers. This cybercrime campaign is focused mainly on the
theft of cryptocurrency wallets, and we estimate that the attackers have already made off with hundreds
of millions of dollars.
This campaign was also reported by additional companies and organizations, including JPCERT/CC1,
NTT Security2 and F-SECURE3. The campaign is also known as CryptoMimic, Dangerous Password and
Leery Turtle.
In our report we attributed this campaign to a specific actor – North Korea’s LAZARUS APT Group. This
attribution is a result of two stages of research:
•
•

First stage– connecting all research documents to the same campaign: a comparative study of
all the research documents trying to prove they are all referring to the same campaign.
Second stage – Attribution to Lazarus: We adopted F-SECURE’s attribution to LAZARUS. Then we
reaffirmed this attribution by comparing the attack tools found in this campaign to other
Lazarus campaigns and found strong similarities.

Our research shows a MEDIUM-HIGH likelihood that Lazarus group, a North-Korean, state-sponsored
APT group, is attacking crypto exchanges all over the world and in Israel for at least three years. This
group is has successfully hacked into numerous companies and organizations around the world for
many years. Until recently this group was not known to attack Israeli targets.

We would like to thank NTT Security Japan for sharing malware samples with us, and for their feedback
on this research.

Background
LAZARUS
LAZARUS AKA APT38, Hidden Cobra, Whois Team, ZINC and others is a North Korean APT group active
since at least 2009. The group’s focus is mainly espionage, political attacks (anti-US and anti-South
Korea, mostly) and financial, especially cryptocurrency wallets attack. According to the FBI this group is
state-sponsored and is a part of North Korea’s RGB intelligence agency.

CryptoCore - An Attack Campaign Targeting Israeli CryptoExchanges
On June 2020, we released a detailed report about a three-year-old campaign targeting cryptoexchanges in Israel, US, Europe, and Japan by unknown group which we dubbed CryproCore4 campaign.
We also identified that the attackers behind this campaign stole millions of dollars’ worth of
cryptocurrency wallets.
While at the time, we did not attribute this campaign, our initial hypothesis was that this group is of
Russian or other eastern-European origin.
Parallel to our report, other cybersecurity firms released research papers describing similar attacks:
•

•

•

4

A report by F-SECURE which reviewed a large-scale, international campaign found while
investigating attacks on crypto wallets. According to the research paper, the attackers started a
conversation with their targets and convinced them to download a malicious file. The paper
showed an analysis of the malwares used in the attack and outlined similarities between them
and between malwares known to be used by LAZARUS.
A report by the Japanese CERT JPCERT/CC which gave an analysis of several incidents where
employees of Japanese firms were contacted and convinced to download malicious files. The
report gave no further information about the affected parties but gave some technical
information about the malware used for the attack.
A report by the Japanese cybersecurity firm NTT SECURITY which points to a campaign they
dubbed CRYPTOMIMIC. According to the report, large sums of money were stolen from crypto
wallets by contacting users and convincing them to download malicious files. The report
contained information about the attack’s modus operandi, as well as a technical analysis of the
malware used.

By comparing these papers with what we know of the CryptoCore campaign, we found it possible that
they are all referring to the same campaign, with each of the reports touching on parts of a large-scale
attack.
In this research paper we tried to connect the dots from all issued reports to full picture, and also
attempted to support and expand F-SECURE’s attribution of this campaign to LAZARUS.

Research Methodology
The purpose of this research is the attribution of the CryptoCore campaign to a specific APT actor LAZARUS.
We did this in two steps:
First step – We compared ClearSky’s CryptoCore’s research with three other research papers to find
enough similarities to confidently say they are all referring to the same campaign:
•
•
•

Comparing IOC’s from ClearSky’s research with those found in F-SECURE and JPCERT/CC’s
research.
Comparing the VBS script found on ClearSky’s research with the ones found in F-SECURE and
JPCERT/CC’s research.
Comparing the RAT and STEALER tools found in F-SECURE and NTT SECURITY’s research in the
following ways:
o Behavioral similarities
o Similarities in code
o Being signed by the same YARA rules

Second step – Having shown that the four research papers all refer to the same attack campaign, we
accepted F-SECURE’s attribution of this campaign to LAZARUS by doing these corroborating tests:
•
•
•

Identifying several uncommon elements, known to LAZARUS-related, that appear in RATs from FSECURE’s and NTT SECURITY’s research papers.
Testing whether YARA rules created by F-SECURE as part of their research would apply to a RAT
from ESET’s LAZARUS report.
Testing whether YARA rules created by F-SECURE as part of their research would apply to a RAT
from KASPERSKY’s LAZARUS report.

First stage - Finding Similarities Between the Four
Research Papers
Comparing ClearSky’s research to F-SECURE and JPCERT/CC
We started by comparing ClearSky’s CryptoCore research paper to two additional papers by F-SECURE
and JPCERT/CC which seem to point to the same attack campaign and APT group. By comparing these
research papers, we found that they share:
•
•

A large number of IoC’s
A VBS script used for communication with C&C servers.

Our working hypothesis is that since all three papers share many varied IoCs (domains, IPs, Files etc.) as
well as the same VBS script, then they all point to the same attack campaign.

1. Comparison of indicators (IOC’s) between ClearSky’s and F-Secure’s research:
The following 40 IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and F-SECURE papers:
Identical IOC’s in both ClearSky’s and F-SECURE’s research

2. Comparison of indicators (IOC’s) between ClearSky’s and JPCERT/CC’s research:
The following six IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and JPCERT/CC papers:

3. Comparison of VBS scripts found in ClearSky’s and F-SECURE’s research:
As part of ClearSky’s CryptoCore research, we uncovered a VBS script used for connecting the
attacked system with C&C servers and awaiting instructions. A nearly identical script was
presented as part of F-SECURE’s research. Here are the two scripts, un-obfuscated, side by side:

We can see that both scripts work the same:
1. Send a request to the first argument passed to the script on runtime with the string:
?topic=s[random-digits] .
2. Start infinite loop:
a. Wait for response.:
i. If response was returned, attempt to run it.
ii. If response was not returned, wait three minutes.

4. Comparison of VBS script between ClearSky and JPCERT/CC:
A reference is made in JPCERT/CC’s report to a very similar script, which operates in the same
fashion and has the same parameters:

5. CONCLUSION
Given the large amount of similar IOC’s and a virtually identical VBS script all found in ClearSky’s,
F-SECURE’s and JPCERT/CC’s research papers, we can assume it is highly probable they are all
referring to the same attack campaign.

Comparing Malware from F-SECURE’s and NTT SECURITY’s
reports
Another research paper we found to be related to the same attack campaign is by NTT SECURITY. To
clearly say they are related, we searched for similarities between the RAT and STEALER tools found in
NTT SECURITY’s and F-SECURE’s research papers. Our working hypothesis is that if the different
malwares display many similarities, then NTT SECURITY’s research can also be said to relate to the same
attack campaign.
1. The following are behavioral similarities of the RATs found in F-SECURE’s and NTT SECURITY’s
research:
File Name

Note again the usage of the Unique RC4 encryption. The wrapper function in both cases was likewise
identical.
4. Checking applicability of YARA rules
Another test we performed in whether YARA rules written by F-SECURE for the RAT and STEALER
they identified in their research would apply to the RAT and STEALER identified by NTT
SECURITY.
Name of F-SECURE rule
lazarus_lssvc_ntuser_unpacked
lazarus_rc4_loop

Stealer from NTT Secure’s report
Signed
Signed

msoRAT from NTT Secure’s report
Signed
Signed

Our test found that the answer to that is yes – F-SECURE’s rules did sign the tools found in NTT
SECURITY’s research. This strengthens the hypothesis that these tools were created by the same
actors.
Here is an example of F-SECURE’s YARA rules signing the RAT from NTT SECURITY’s research
(msoRAT):

5. CONCLUSION
Given the similarities between F-SECURE’s and NTT-SECURITY’s RAT and STEALER in:
• File behavior
• Similarities in code
• Being signed by the same YARA rules
We can say with a high probability that NTT SECURITY’s research also deals with the same attack
campaign and attacker as the other three research papers. This means that all four research
papers are about the same attack campaign.

Second Stage - Reaffirming F-SECURE’s attribution of the
attacks to Lazarus
After showing that all four research papers point to the same attack campaign, we attempted to reaffirm
the hypothesis in F-SECURE’s paper attributing the campaign to LAZARUS.
We did this by applying YARA rules for the RAT identified in F-SECURE’s report to a different RAT named
“NukeSpeed” found in ESET’s report and verified as belonging to LAZARUS (SHA256
8b6887c5ec6fadaefee78f089e9a347a539bcedf52f5827f866a49a1839f8c4b):

As we can see, the RC4 algorithm unique to LAZARUS and the backdoor for the RAT from F-SECURE’s
research were both found in the RAT from ESET’s research.
It is worth noting that in Fsecure’s report they reference a RAT from an older LAZARUS report from 2016,
conducted by KASPERSKY (bbd703f0d6b1cad4ff8f3d2ee3cc073c). Attempting to apply F-SECURE’s
backdoor YARA rule to the findings from this report will not work, but only because the 2016 backdoor
accesses a file named “scaeve.dat” while in newer versions that has been changed to “perflog.dat”.
Changing the file’s name would cause the YARA rule to apply to the 2016 research as well.
Kaspersky

We can see that our test for applying YARA rules from F-SECURE’s research to ESET’s and KASPERSKY’s
research worked, and highly strengthens the attribution of these attacks to LAZARUS.
During our research, we located several indicative and uncommon traits for LAZARUS tools that were
part of the attack campaign:
Similar traits for RAT:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

RAT is named ntuser.cat.
Usage of the packers themida and VMProtect.
Injection of malware to process explorer.exe, and potentially to other processes.
RAT accesses file “msomain.sdb” and decrypts it. This file contains information of C&C servers.
Base64 encoding in RAT’s code.
Unique code in RAT and STEALER for RC4 encryption. This code has only ever been found in
LAZARUS tools.
7. Uniform malware command-parsing table, indicating the same RAT was used for several targets.
8. Unique wrapper function for decrypting RC4 and Base64.
Similar traits for STEALER:
1. Usage of the packers themida and VMProtect.
2. Injection of malware to process lsass.exe, probably done to dump user passwords and steal
data.
3. STEALER accesses file “msomain.sdb” and decrypts it. This file contains information of C&C
servers.
4. Unique code in RAT and STEALER for RC4 encryption. This code has only ever been found in
LAZARUS tools.
5. Unique wrapper function for decrypting RC4 and Base64 (different than the one in the RAT).

In some samples, it was impossible to detect which packer was used with traditional tools such as
ExeInfoPE. However, it was possible to detect the VMProtect packer by viewing the sections within the
samples, as VMProtect creates two custom sections postfixed with ‘0’ and ‘1’.

CONCLUSION
By being able to sign F-SECURE’s YARA rules to RATs associated with LAZARUS from ESET and
KASPERSKY’s we have greatly strengthened F-SECURE’s attribution of the CryptoCore attack campaign to
LAZARUS.
In addition, we have located several indicative and uncommon traits in these tools all associated with
LAZARUS.
The above information means we can, with a high level of probability, attribute the CryptoCore attack
campaign to LAZARUS.
