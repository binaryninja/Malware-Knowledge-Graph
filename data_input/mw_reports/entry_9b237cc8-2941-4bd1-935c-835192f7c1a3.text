Trickbot Adds Credential-Grabbing Capabilities

February 12, 2019

In November 2018, we covered a Trickbot variant that came with a password-grabbing
module, which allowed it to steal credentials from numerous applications. In January 2019,
we saw Trickbot (detected as TrojanSpy.Win32.TRICKBOT.AZ and
Trojan.Win32.MERETAM.AD) with new capabilities added to its already extensive bag of
tricks. Its authors clearly aren't done updating Trickbot — we recently found a new variant
that uses an updated version of the pwgrab module that lets it grab remote application
credentials.
Infection Chain

Technical Analysis
The malware arrives via an email disguised as a tax incentive notification from a major
financial services company. This email includes a macro enabled (XLSM) Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet attachment (detected as Trojan.W97M.MERETAM.A) that purportedly contains
the details of the tax incentive. However, as these attachments usually go, this macro is
malicious and will download and deploy Trickbot on the user’s machine once activated.

This Trickbot variant is largely similar to the variant we discovered in November. However,
the 2019 version adds three new functions, one each for the Virtual Network Computing
(VNC), PuTTY, and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) platforms.

One of the techniques enforced by these new functions encrypts the strings it uses via
simple variants of XOR or SUB routines.

It also makes use of API hashes for indirect API calling, which was prominently attributed to
the Carberp trojan source code leak from 2013.

VNC
To grab VNC credentials, the pwgrab module searches for files using the “*.vnc.lnk” affix that
are located in the following directories:
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent
%USERPROFILE%\Documents, %USERPROFILE%\Downloads

The stolen information includes the target machine's hostname, port, and the proxy settings.

The module will send the required data via POST, which is configured through a downloaded
configuration file using the filename “dpost.” This file contains a list of command-and-control
(C&C) servers that will receive the exfiltrated data from the victim.

PuTTY
To retrieve the PuTTY credentials, it queries the registry key
Software\SimonTatham\Putty\Sessions to identify the saved connection settings, which
allows the module to retrieve information such as the Hostname and Username, and Private
Key Files used for authentication.

username and Private Key Files (right).
RDP
Its third function related to RDP uses the CredEnumerateA API to identify and steal saved
credentials. It then parses the string “target=TERMSRV” to identify the hostname,
username, and password saved per RDP credential.
Recommendations
These new additions to the already “tricky” Trickbot show one strategy that many authors use
to improve the capabilities of their creations: gradual evolution of existing malware. While this
new variant is not groundbreaking in terms of what it can do, it proves that the groups or
individuals behind Trickbot are not resting on their laurels and continuously improve it,
making an already-dangerous malware even more effective.
Fortunately, users can nip these attacks in the bud simply by following the best practices
against spam. This includes being aware of the main characteristics of a spam email, such
as a suspicious sender address and multiple grammatical errors. We also recommended that
users refrain from opening email attachments unless they are sure that it is from a legitimate
source.
