from cloud to endpoint

June 18, 2020

The increasing pervasiveness of cloud services in today’s work environments, accelerated by
a crisis that forced companies around the globe to shift to remote work, is significantly
changing how defenders must monitor and protect organizations. Corporate data is spread
across multiple applications—on-premises and in the cloud—and accessed by users from
anywhere using any device. With traditional surfaces expanding and network perimeters
disappearing, novel attack scenarios and techniques are introduced.
Every day, we see attackers mount an offensive against target organizations through the
cloud and various other attack vectors with the goal of finding the path of least resistance,
quickly expanding foothold, and gaining control of valuable information and assets. To help
organizations fend off these advanced attacks, Microsoft 365 Defender (previously Microsoft
Threat Protection) leverages the Microsoft 365 security portfolio to automatically analyze
cross-domain threat data, building a complete picture of each attack in a single dashboard.
With this breadth and depth of clarity, defenders can focus on critical threats and hunting for
sophisticated breaches across endpoints, email, identities and applications.
Among the wide range of actors that Microsoft tracks—from digital crime groups to nationstate activity groups—HOLMIUM is one of the most proficient in using cloud-based attack
vectors. Attributed to a Middle East-based group and active since at least 2015, HOLMIUM

has been performing espionage and destructive attacks targeting aerospace, defense,
chemical, mining, and petrochemical-mining industries. HOLMIUM’s activities and techniques
overlap with what other researchers and vendors refer to as APT33, StoneDrill, and Elfin.
HOLMIUM has been observed using various vectors for initial access, including spearphishing email, sometimes carrying archive attachments that exploit the CVE-2018-20250
vulnerability in WinRAR, and password-spraying. Many of their recent attacks, however,
have involved the penetration testing tool Ruler used in tandem with compromised Exchange
credentials.
The group used Ruler to configure a specially crafted Outlook Home Page URL to exploit the
security bypass vulnerability CVE-2017-11774, which was fixed shortly after it was
discovered. Successful exploitation automatically triggered remote code execution of a script
when an Outlook client synced with a mailbox and rendered the profile Home Page URL.
These scripts, usually VBScript followed by PowerShell, in turn initiated the delivery of
various payloads.
In this blog, the first in the Inside Microsoft 365 Defender series, we will show how Microsoft
365 Defender provides unparalleled end-to-end visibility into the activities of nation-state
level attacks like HOLMIUM. In succeeding blog posts in this series, we will shine a spotlight
on aspects of the coordinated defense delivered by Microsoft 365 Defender.

Tracing an end-to-end cloud-based HOLMIUM attack
HOLMIUM has likely been running cloud-based attacks with Ruler since 2018, but a notable
wave of such attacks was observed in the first half of 2019. These attacks combined the
outcome of continuous password spray activities against multiple organizations, followed by
successful compromise of Office 365 accounts and the use of Ruler in short sequences to
gain control of endpoints. This wave of attacks was the subject of a warning from US
Cybercom in July 2019.
These HOLMIUM attacks typically started with intensive password spray against exposed
Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) infrastructure; organizations that were not using
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Office 365 accounts had a higher risk of having
accounts compromised through password spray. After successfully identifying a few user and
password combinations via password spray, HOLMIUM used virtual private network (VPN)
services with IP addresses associated with multiple countries to validate that the
compromised accounts also had access to Office 365.

Defender for Cloud Apps (previously Microsoft Cloud App Security)
Armed with a few compromised Office 365 accounts and not blocked by MFA defense, the
group launched the next step with Ruler and configured a malicious Home Page URL which,
once rendered during a normal email session, resulted in the remote code execution of a
PowerShell backdoor through the exploitation of a vulnerability like CVE-2017-11774. The
two domains abused by HOLMIUM and observed during this 2019 campaign were
“topaudiobook.net” and “customermgmt.net”.

This initial foothold allowed HOLMIUM to run their custom PowerShell backdoor (known as
POWERTON) directly from an Outlook process and to perform the installation of additional
payloads on the endpoint with different persistence mechanisms, such as WMI subscription
(T1084) or registry autorun keys (T1060). Once the group has taken control of the endpoint
(in addition to the cloud identity), the next phase was hours of exploration of the victim’s
network, enumerating user accounts and machines for additional compromise, and lateral
movement within the perimeter. HOLMIUM attacks typically took less than a week from initial
access via the cloud to obtaining unhampered access and full domain compromise, which
then allowed the attackers to stay persistent for long periods of time, sometimes for months
on end.

HOLMIUM attacks as seen and acted upon by Microsoft 365 Defender
HOLMIUM attacks demonstrate how hybrid attacks that span from cloud to endpoints require
a wide range of sensors for comprehensive visibility. Enabling organizations to detect attacks
like these by correlating events in multiple domains – cloud, identity, endpoints – is the
reason why we build products like Microsoft 365 Defender. As we described in our analysis
5/11

of HOLMIUM attacks, the group compromised identities in the cloud and leveraged cloud
APIs to gain code execution or persist. The attackers then used a cloud email configuration
to run specially crafted PowerShell on endpoints every time the Outlook process is opened.
During these attacks, many target organizations reacted too late in the attack chain—when
the malicious activities started manifesting on endpoints via the PowerShell commands and
subsequent lateral movement behavior. The earlier attack stages like cloud events and
password spray activities were oftentimes missed or sometimes not linked with activities
observed on the endpoint. This resulted in gaps in visibility and, subsequently, incomplete
remediation.
While it’s relatively easy to remediate and stop malicious processes and downloaded
malware on endpoints using endpoint security solutions, such a conventional approach
would mean that the attack is persistent in the cloud, so the endpoint could be immediately
compromised again. Remediating identities in the cloud is a different story.

Figure 5. The typical timeline of a HOLMIUM attack kill-chain
In an organization utilizing Microsoft 365 Defender, multiple expert systems that monitor
various aspects of the network would detect and raise alerts on HOLMIUM’s activities.
Microsoft 365 Defender sees the full attack chain across domains beyond simply blocking on
endpoints or zapping emails, thus putting organizations in a superior position to fight the
threat.

techniques across the kill chain.
These systems work in unison to prevent attacks or detect, block, and remediate malicious
activities. Across affected domains, Microsoft 365 Defender detects signs of HOLMIUM’s
attacks:
Microsoft Defender for Identity (previously Azure Advanced Threat Protection) identifies
account enumeration and brute force attacks
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (previously Microsoft Cloud App Security) detects
anomalous Office 365 sign-ins that use potentially compromised credentials or from
suspicious locations or networks
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (previously Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat
Protection) exposes malicious PowerShell executions on endpoints triggered from
Outlook Home Page exploitation

expert systems
Traditionally, these detections would each be surfaced in its own portal, alerting on pieces of
the attack but requiring the security team to stitch together the full picture. With Microsoft 365
Defender, the pieces of the puzzle are fused automatically through deep threat investigation.
Microsoft 365 Defender generates a combined incident view that shows the end-to-end
attack, with all related evidence and affected assets in one view.

Understanding the full attack chain enables Microsoft 365 Defender to automatically
intervene to block the attack and remediate assets holistically across domains. In HOLMIUM
attacks, Microsoft 365 Defender not only stops the PowerShell activity on endpoints but also
contains the impact of stolen user accounts by marking them as compromised in Azure AD.
This invokes Conditional Access as configured in Azure AD and applies conditions like MFA
or limitations on the user account’s permissions to access organizational resources until the
account is remediated fully.

Figure 9. Coordinated automatic containment and remediation across email, identity, and
endpoints
Security teams can dig deep and expand their investigation into the incident in Microsoft 365
Security Center, where all details and related activities are available in one place.
Furthermore, security teams can hunt for more malicious activities and artifacts through
advanced hunting, which brings together all the raw data collected across product domains
into one unified schema with powerful query constructs.

Finally, when the attack is blocked and all affected assets are remediated, Microsoft 365
Defender helps organizations identify improvements to their security configuration that would
prevent the attacker from returning. The Threat Analytics report provides an exposure view
and recommends prevention measures relevant to the threat. For example, the Analytics
Report for HOLMIUM recommended, among other things, applying the appropriate security
updates to prevent tools like Ruler from operating, as well as completely eliminating this
attack vector in the organization.
