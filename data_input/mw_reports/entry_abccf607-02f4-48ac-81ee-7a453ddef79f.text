The Quantum Locker is a ransomware strain that was first discovered in July 2021. Since then, the
ransomware was observed used in fast ransomware attacks, in some cases even Time-to-Ransom (TTR) of
less than 4 hours, leaving defenders little time to react.

Key Details
Time-to-Ransom (TTR) of less than 4 hours: From initial infection to encryption takes even less than
4 hours, leaving a very short window for defenders to successfully defend against the threat.
High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the
destructive potential of the attacks.
Human Operated Attack: Prior to the deployment of the ransomware, the attackers attempt to infiltrate
and move laterally throughout the organization, carrying out a fully-developed RansomOps attack.
Detected and Prevented: The AI-Driven Cybereason XDR Platform fully detects and prevents the
Quantum Locker.

Cybereason Blocks Quantum Locker
The Quantum ransomware is another rebranding of the notorious MountLocker ransomware, which launched
back in September 2020. Since then, the ransomware gang has rebranded its operation to various names,
including AstroLocker, XingLocker, and now in its current phase, the Quantum Locker:

Rebranding of Mount Locker
Same with other ransomware that follow the double extortion trend, that became already a second nature to
ransomware, the Quantum Locker has its own data leak TOR website - “Quantum Blog”, and according to it
the gang has over 20 victims, with 7 of them being new as of April 2022:

The ransom demands for the gang vary depending on the victim, with some attacks demanding $150,000 to
receive a decryptor, while others are multi-million dollar demands, as shown below:

The victim only gets 72 hours to get back in touch with the gang, and if not - the stolen data is shared on the
website for free downloads for the public:

Breaking Down the Attack
Initial Infection Vector - IcedID
The infamous malware, IcedID, that started as a banking trojan back in 2017, is observed being utilized as the
initial access by various ransomware gangs. Among those gangs are Conti, REvil, and the former brand of
Quantum - the Xing Locker. As for now, the gang seems to continue with this method with the Quantum
Locker as well; “If it ain't broke don’t fix it.”
The campaign of IcedID observed ending in Quantum Locker execution starts with a phishing attack via
email. The email contained an .iso image file that contains the IcedID loader payload in the form of a DLL
(dar.dll) and shortcut file - an .LNK file - that targets the IcedID payload and masquerades as a document.
When mounting the .iso file, the end user only sees the shortcut file named “document”, and the DLL itself is
hidden. After the user clicks on the shortcut, the IcedID DLL is executed:

Document.lnk

properties
The unpacked DLL is loaded into memory (loader_dll_64.dll) and it begins its communication with the C2:

As with most commodity malware, for example TrickBot, IcedID executes initial discovery commands and
then exfiltrates the results via the C2 channel. If threat actors find the organization to be of interest, they will
launch the next phase:
Cmd.exe /c chcp >&2
Ipconfig /all
Systeminfo
Net config workstation
Nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
Net view /all /domain
Net view /all
Net group Domain Admins /domain

IcedID reconnaissance commands

Moving to an Interactive Attack
The next phase of the attack starts after IcedID sends the reconnaissance output back to the C2. In some
cases, it started just two hours after the user clicks on the .lnk file. In this phase, the threat actor starts an
interactive attack in the breached network. To do so, they use the initial IcedID implant to download and
execute another implant. In most cases the gang used Cobalt Strike beacon to launch the interactive phase.
First, the threat actor wants to perform additional and more in-depth reconnaissance activity. They execute a
script named adfind.bat that uses the tool AdFind to collect information about the Active Directory. In addition,
they also run a batch script named ns.bat which runs nslookup for each host in the domain.
The AdFind.bat script is dropped in the %temp% directory, along with the AdFind.exe binary and 7Zip binary
named 7.exe. The output is saved into .txt files and sent to the C2. After that, the batch file removes tracks by
deleting the script, the AdFind binary, the .txt files and the 7Zip binary:

Lateral Movement
To move laterally in the environment, the threat actor first dumps the lsass process and gains credentials.
Then, they start making RDP connections to other servers in the environment and remote WMI discovery
tasks to test the gained credentials:

credential dumping as shown in the Cybereason XDR Platform
After confirming that the credentials work, the threat actor continues to prepare for the deployment of the
Quantum Locker. They start spreading in the network by copying the ransomware binary to the other
machine's c$\windows\temp\ shared folder and then execute them remotely via WMI and PsExec.

Ransomware Execution
Upon execution, the ransomware first checks for the presence of different services and processes related to
security software such as AVs, malware analysis tools, Microsoft Office, browsers and databases. If found,
the ransomware tries to kill the service / process:

List of processes to terminate
Then, the ransomware starts its encryption routine. It encrypts the files on the disc and appends the .quantum
extension to it. It also leaves a ransom note named README_TO_DECRYPT.html:

In addition, the ransomware creates a log file for its execution named <ransom_binary>.exe.log. This log file
contains information about the machine, user, domain, killed processes and services, and each file's status - if
it was encrypted or skipped.

Cybereason Detection and Prevention
The AI-driven Cybereason XDR Platform is able to prevent the execution of the Quantum Locker using multilayer protection that detects and blocks malware with threat intelligence, machine learning, and next-gen
antivirus (NGAV) capabilities. Additionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled, behavioral
detection techniques in the platform are able to detect and prevent any attempt to encrypt files and generates
a MalOpTM for it:

Using the Anti-Malware feature with the right configurations (listed in the recommendations below), the
Cybereason XDR Platform will also detect and prevent the execution of the ransomware and ensure that it
cannot encrypt targeted files. The prevention is based on machine learning, which blocks both known and
unknown malware variants:
