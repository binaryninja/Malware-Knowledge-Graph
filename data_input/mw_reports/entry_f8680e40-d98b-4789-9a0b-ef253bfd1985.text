WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft was hacked as part of the suspected Russian
campaign that has hit multiple U.S. government agencies by taking advantage of the
widespread use of software from SolarWinds Corp, according to people familiar with the

As with networking management software by SolarWinds, Microsoftâ€™s own products were
then used to further the attacks on others, the people said.
It was not immediately clear how many Microsoft users were affected by the tainted products.
The Department of Homeland Security, which said earlier Thursday that the hackers used
multiple methods of entry, is continuing to investigate.
Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
