Message
This past year has been a year of
unprecedented growth for CIS. Our
role as a global, independent leader
in cybersecurity for public and private
organizations was demonstrated
with expanded products and services
across all of our program areas. This
expansion enabled CIS to increase our
impact with best practice solutions for
improving cyber defense that enable
an environment of increased trust in
cyberspace.

522 New Members

During 2017, the Multi-State
Information Sharing & Analysis
Center® (MS-ISAC®) added 522 new
members to top the 1,800 mark.
MS-ISAC membership organizations
now cover 70% of the U.S. population.
Additionally, the MS-ISAC ended 2017
monitoring 51 of the 56 U.S. States
and Territories. Our partnerships
with state and local government
organizations as well as the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) continue to grow stronger,
resulting in increased depth and
breadth of the intelligence provided
through the MS-ISAC monitoring,
information sharing, and cyber
education missions.
In late 2017, CIS initiated work to
help secure our nation’s elections
infrastructure in collaboration
with state and local elections
officials, federal agencies, vendors,
academia, and other nonprofit
organizations. Development was
begun of a handbook identifying best
security practices for U.S. election
infrastructure security to be published
in early 2018. In addition, working
with state elections officials and
DHS, CIS initiated a pilot Elections
Infrastructure Information Sharing
& Analysis Center™ (EI-ISAC™) for
elections officials and their technical
teams.

CIS greatly expanded the quality and
quantity of its product offerings this
year. We increased the functionality
of our marquee products, the CIS
Benchmarks™ and the CIS-CAT™
assessment tool. CIS also repackaged
and rebranded our core membership
offering into a new membership
model — CIS SecureSuite®. This
new membership model gives
organizations of all sizes access to an
updated CIS-CAT Pro configuration
assessment tool, including the
CIS-CAT Pro Assessor and Dashboard
components, more remediation
content, full-format CIS Benchmarks,
select CIS Benchmarks annotated
with CIS Controls™ mappings, as well
as tutorials and support from CIS
staff and developers. CIS SecureSuite
Membership grew by more than
40 percent during 2017 to 1,484
members.
CIS also continues to grow its presence
and impact in the cloud by expanding
our CIS Hardened Images™ offerings
to both the Microsoft® Azure and
Google Cloud™Platform, in addition
to the previous Amazon Web
Services® support. Cloud customers
used more than 68 million machine
hours of CIS Hardened Images in 2017.
Our cloud offerings have emerged
as CIS’ fastest-growing and most
impactful product offering.

world-class innovations,
support, and resources

Last but not least, the CIS Controls
Version 6 remained a popular resource
for cyber defense, with 38,657
downloads in 2017 – and we plan to
surpass 100,000 total downloads in
early 2018. Development of the CIS
Controls Version 7 was initiated with
a planned release in early 2018.

CIS launched new and updated
functionality to our existing
membership and suite of
cybersecurity tools via the CIS
SecureSuite Membership (formerly
Security Benchmarks Membership)
this year. CIS SecureSuite Membership
includes the combination of the
powerful CIS Benchmarks standards
with the globally-recognized
guidance of the CIS Controls best
practices: many CIS Benchmarks
are now developed with mappings
to the CIS Controls, with plans to
include all current CIS Benchmarks.
Membership provides access to a
range of tools and resources for public
and private organizations, including:
CIS Benchmarks annotated with CIS
Controls; CIS-CAT Pro Assessor and
Dashboard; and CIS WorkBench.

In 2017 CIS launched CIS-CAT Pro, the
new, expanded version of CIS-CAT
with two components: CIS-CAT Pro
Assessor and CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard.
CIS-CAT Pro Assessor provides the
ability to port assessment results to
the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard. With the
addition of the enhancements to the
Dashboard, CIS SecureSuite members
have dynamic and real-time views
into their ecosystem. Enhancements
include multiple benchmark views,
multiple device views, tagging, and
drill-down capabilities, exceptions
creation, evidence-based reports,
various export report formats, CIS
Controls view, remediation reports,
and complete reporting options.
Throughout 2017, work continued
to evolve CIS-CAT Pro, including
gathering feedback to develop
remote assessment capabilities (beta
testing planned in early 2018).
CIS WorkBench is still the central
hub of the CIS communities, and
the CIS Controls community was
added in 2017. Thanks to feedback
from its communities and users,
CIS WorkBench continued to
evolve in 2017 as the tool for the
development and maintenance of
the CIS Benchmarks, improving the
CIS WorkBench user experience,
CIS Controls annotations, export
functionality, and more.

During 2017, the CIS Controls
program began a collaboration
process with a global community of
cybersecurity experts for updating
the CIS Controls to align with the
latest cyber threat data, security
technology, as well as increasing
business demands for information
technology. The cybersecurity world
is constantly shifting and reacting
to new threats and vulnerabilities,
which often results in chaos and
confusion about which steps to take
in order to harden systems and data.
Seven key principles were identified
to yield a more flexible, measurable,
and helpful resource for any business
or organization looking to secure its
systems and data.

Cybersecurity Quarterly

One of the first and most important steps in securing your
organization’s network — determining what devices are
actually connected to it
By Philippe Langlois

At CIS, we are firm believers that organizations must
have an intimate knowledge of their infrastructure
to know what to protect and how best to protect
it. Consider it a form of “defensive intelligence”
that focuses on internal knowledge of assets and
vulnerabilities, instead of “threat intelligence” that
focuses on adversaries. We realize that not every
organization has the resources to stand up their
own intelligence team and translate threat intel
reports into defensives actions; that is why we’ve
imbued our knowledge of adversaries and cyber
defense into the CIS Critical Security Controls, a set
of prioritized cybersecurity recommendations used
by organizations worldwide to counter the most
pervasive cybersecurity attacks.
There are currently 20 CIS Controls, each of which is
further divided into sub-controls. The CIS Controls
provide the ultimate end-state organizations should
seek to achieve as part of their cybersecurity efforts,
while the sub-controls provide prescriptive actions
organizations can take to achieve the goals. The CIS
Controls cover many of the traditional areas of

Why Inventory
Matters for
Security

As many organizations are chasing down the
“best threat feed” and scrambling to find the tools
with the most “machine learning capabilities,”
they sometimes neglect some of the foundational
security controls that every organization should
master.

™

In a world of clouds, mobile
devices, BYOD, and so on,
why does it matter to protect
hardware? ... because data still
resides somewhere, and we
still have a duty to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of that data.
cybersecurity, such as vulnerability management
(Control 4) and malware defense (Control 8), as
well as objectives that are often considered to be IT
management activities. In this article, we’ll examine
the importance of managing your hardware
and software through CIS Control 1: Inventory of
Authorized and Unauthorized Devices.
In a world of clouds, mobile devices, BYOD, and
so on, why does it matter to protect hardware? ...
because data still resides somewhere, and we still
have a duty to protect the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of that data. Therefore, we better
know what is in our environment and how it is being
stored, processed, and accessed. Your inventory of
hardware assets should include not just a static list
of assets, but also the ability to automatically detect
new assets being connected to your environment, as

well as the ability to deny those unapproved devices.
There are two main reasons why you should
care about maintaining an accurate inventory of
hardware on your network. The first is the more
classical justification in security: “I want to detect
and correct when bad guys walk in and plug
something into my infrastructure.” It might sound
rather far-fetched to think that someone could
just simply walk into your organization and plug
in a device, but this has become a common part of
many pentests for a reason – it works! Of course,
you would hope that staff would be a little wary
of an unknown and unaccounted device suddenly
showing up, but what if that computer was just
a small Raspberry Pi hidden in a universal power
supply?
If you haven’t heard of the companies that now
produce pentesting tools masquerading as normal
office technology, fire up your favorite browser and
learn all the creative places people have stuffed
their favorite pentesting operating system. Neat
stuff for a pen tester; a little more harrowing from a
defender’s perspective.
The second reason an accurate hardware inventory
matters: how can you protect something if you
don’t know it’s there? In order to properly scan,
fix, and secure all your assets, you need to have an
accurate count of them. We’ve seen it happen all
too often where a scanner was misconfigured or a
single device was forgotten, leaving the door open
for cyber criminals to wreak havoc. One of the classic

Inventories can get complicated
and it may not seem like a high
pay off at first, but without
knowing what to protect and how
to keep rogue devices off your
network, you’ll have a difficult
time applying the other Controls
and protecting your organization.
stories about forgotten assets is the case of the
university that was unable to find one of their server
racks, only to discover, after physically following the
Ethernet cable, that it had been walled over!
Inventories can get complicated and it may not
seem like a high pay off at first, but without
knowing what to protect and how to keep rogue
devices off your network, you’ll have a difficult time
applying the other Controls and protecting your
organization. Don’t let your forgotten assets be an
easy target!

Consulting
CIS engaged with several private
sector organizations to provide select
services in 2017. These services include
vulnerability scanning, consulting,
training seminars, and assistance
with implementing CIS-CAT™ Pro.
These services were offered on a “for
fee” basis to allow CIS to cover costs
for services rendered and provide
additional revenue streams to support
other mission efforts. During 2017
CIS performed speaking events
and seminars for 11 organizations,
vulnerability scanning or pen testing
for three organizations, assistance
with implementing CIS-CAT Pro for
two, and the development of specific
policy templates to assist in complying
with the New York State Department
of Financial Services Cybersecurity
Regulations for one large financial
professional association.

Partner Paid
CIS provides select services to state
and local governments on a “for
fee” basis as a way to fund services
beyond the scope of the cooperative
agreement and to generate additional
revenue for CIS to help us achieve our
mission. These services include Albert
Monitoring, vulnerability scanning,
and consulting services. In 2017, CIS
added 18 new Albert devices,
bringing the total number of
partner-paid devices in service to
85. During this time, we were also
engaged to perform four vulnerability
assessments and 17 consulting
engagements. As Albert is a low-cost
intrusion detection and NetFlow
monitoring solution, it is becoming
increasingly popular among state and
local governments looking to enhance
their cybersecurity defenses.
