Threat Thursday: Ficker Infostealer Malware

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

Ficker is a malicious information-stealer that is sold and distributed on underground
Russian online forums by a threat actor using the alias @ficker. This Malware-as-a-Service
(MaaS) was first uncovered in the wild in mid-2020.
Ficker has been previously distributed via Trojanized web links and compromised websites.
For example, it could direct victims to pages purportedly offering free downloads of
legitimate paid services like Spotify and YouTube Premium. It has also recently been
deployed via the known malware downloader, Hancitor.
Notably written in Rust, Ficker has several targets for its information stealing, including web
browsers, credit card information, crypto-wallets, FTP clients and other applications. Along
with anti-analysis checks, the malware can also deploy further functionality and download
additional malware once a system is successfully compromised.

Risk & Impact

Ficker offers several paid packages, with different levels of subscription fees to use their
malicious program. Once the malware subscription is purchased, the malware author
provides a web-based panel to the buyer to collect and examine information stolen from
victims, as well as the executable of the information stealer itself.

The creator of the malware is frequently active on the forums related to the malware, as
seen in the image below:

Figure 2: Translated “update log” from malware author
Since its introduction last year, Ficker has been deployed in a wide variety of ways. This is
likely due to multiple threat actors using the malware differently in smaller individual
campaigns.
In its early days, Ficker victims had mostly downloaded and executed the threat accidentally
after visiting compromised websites or inadvertently clicking on malicious web links. Threat
actors will often create fake ads for legitimate and popular services to lure unsuspecting
users into visiting or clicking on Trojanized material.
For example, Ficker has previously been hosted on lure pages masquerading as a
“Microsoft® Store” webpage, to entice users to download malicious applications while lulling
them into a false sense of security.

Hancitor
In recent months, Ficker has been deployed and dropped by the known malware family
Hancitor. Hancitor’s attack chain often begins with the threat actor sending out fake
DocuSign malspam emails, which results in a victim unknowingly downloading a Trojanized
Microsoft® Word document, thinking they are getting a real DocuSign doc.
Once the fake DocuSign document is opened and its malicious macro code is allowed to
run, Hancitor will often reach out to its command and control (C2) infrastructure to receive a
malicious URL containing a sample of Ficker to download, as seen below:

Figure 3: Example of Hancitor downloading Ficker infostealer
Depending on the commands the Hancitor C2 sends, Ficker is often injected into an
instance of svchost.exe on a victim’s machine, as seen below. It does this to further avoid
detection and hide the activity of this malicious executable.

Anti-Analysis and Initial Checks
When analyzing the file statically, we found that Ficker is heavily obfuscated. It also
contains multiple anti-analysis checks, which are meant to thwart analysis and prevent the
malware from executing in virtualized environments.
The malware author has also included checks so that the malware will not execute if it is
running in selected countries, which is likely intended to protect the threat actors who tend
to purchase such malware. Ficker achieves this by checking the keyboard layout of the
victim’s machine. If their keyboard layout is related to one of these nations, the malware will
terminate:

Russia

be-BY

Belarus

Uzbekistan

Armenia

kk-KZ

To do this, Ficker will reach out to the web API at api[.]ipify[.]org. This is a public IP address
web API used by the malware to gather the external IP address of the victim’s device. The
threat likely uses this as another anti-virtualized environment check, as the malware will not
reach out to its C2 infrastructure if it doesn’t get a successful response to this API call.
Once the victim’s IP address is obtained, the malware will attempt to reach out to its C2
server. If a response is sent successfully, the malware will receive its configuration
commands to perform its desired actions. If the malware cannot obtain such information
from this API call, it will wait until an Internet connection is re-established before reaching
out to its C2.

Stolen Data
Unlike traditional information stealers, Ficker does not write its stolen data to disk.
Traditional infostealer families will often store a local copy of the data it intends to steal, and
then exfiltrate it after a set period of time. Instead, Ficker loops through its instructions and
sends its information directly to the operator of the malware.
The malware author has designed Ficker to have another unique feature: decrypting stolen
data server-side rather than “victim-side.” This is likely done to avoid detection, but it also
gives Ficker’s creator greater control over who is allowed to use their malware.
When sending stolen data, Ficker will initially encrypt it using an XOR rotation. During
analysis, it appears that the same XOR key (0x0A) is used across all samples.
Depending on its commands, Ficker will attempt to exfiltrate the following information:
Chromium web browsers
Saved login credentials
Cookies
Auto-compete history
Mozilla-based web-browsers.
Saved login credentials
Cookies
Auto-complete history
Credit card information
Cryptocurrency wallets
FileZilla FTP client
WinScp FTP client
Discord login

Pidgin accounts
Thunderbird accounts
The malware will also gather system information, as shown below:

The malware also has screen-grab abilities, which allow the malware’s operator to remotely
capture an image of the victim’s screen. The malware also enables file-grabbing and
additional downloading capabilities once connection to its C2 is established, as shown
below. This enables further stages of exploitation on a victim’s device.

Once information is sent back to Ficker’s C2, the malware operator can access and search
for all exfiltrated data.

YARA Rule
The following YARA rule was authored by the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team to
catch the threat described in this document:

7/10

import "pe"
rule Mal_Infostealer_Win32_Ficker_Stealer
{
meta:
description = "Yara rule to detect Ficker Stealer"
author = "Blackberry Threat Research Team"
date = "04-08-2021"
strings:
$x1 = "kindmessage"
$x2 = "SomeNone"
$x3 = ".Kind"
condition:
//PE File
uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and
// Must have the following sections in the following order
pe.section_index(".text") == 0 and
pe.section_index(".data") == 1 and
pe.section_index(".rdata") == 2 and
pe.section_index("/4") == 3 and
pe.section_index(".bss") == 4 and
pe.section_index(".idata") == 5 and
pe.section_index(".CRT") == 6 and
pe.section_index(".tls") == 7 and
// Must be less than
filesize < 300KB and
//One of $x
(2 of ($x*))
}
