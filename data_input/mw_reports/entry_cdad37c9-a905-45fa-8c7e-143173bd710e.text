Joker malware on Google Play Store continues to scare Android users. Its variants continue to find new
tricks and tactics to stay undetected by doing small changes in its code or changing the payload download
techniques.

Technical Analysis
In this blog, we will be analyzing the new Joker sample com.camera.phototimezonecamera. It is clear
from Figure 2 that this new piece of Joker has adapted to multistage dex file loading; as the class name of a
service declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file is not defined in the classes.dex in the APK’s root folder.
This technique has not been seen in any of the previous Joker malware samples.

2/5

Figure 2: Undefined Class Name in AndroidManifest.xml
This means that the class not mentioned in the classes.dex would be loaded in memory at run-time using
any one of the dynamic loading techniques.
Once launched, the malicious Android Package (APK) retrieves first level malicious payload, “a”, a .jar file
(containing the payload dex) from grouplearn[.shop as shown in Figure 3 , which enables the parent
malware with additional malevolent capabilities.

Figure 3: Malicious First Level Payload from C2
This first level payload has a base64 encoded URL to download the next payload as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Reference to the second payload in base64 encoded format
The second payload,”w.iov”, again a .jar file, downloaded from implemente[.life as shown in the Figure 4,
has the class reference of “okhttp3.service” class from the AndroidManifest.xml of
com.camera.phototimezonecamera as shown in Figure 5.
