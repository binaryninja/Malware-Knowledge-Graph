Introduction

The highly active threat group FIN7 has been continuously broadening their cybercrime
horizons and recently added ransomware to its attack arsenal. They are known to hold a
notorious status due to their achievement in deploying extensive backdoors in leveraging
software supply chains, distributing malicious USB sticks, and cooperating with other groups.
Nowadays, its initial approach is to carefully pick high-value companies from the pool of
already compromised enterprise systems and force them to pay large ransoms to restore
their data or seek unique ways to monetize the data and remote access.
FIN7 is also attributed[8] to the espionage campaign named Carbanak, and is known to be
interacting[3] with other hacker groups well-known under names such as LockBit, Darkside,
REvil, or MAZE. Most notably, FIN7 has gathered several uncategorized hacking teams and
created fake infosec firms[5] to trick security researchers into executing ransomware attacks
by taking on names such as Combi Security and Bastion Secure.
From 2013 onwards, the victims ranging from food producers, critical infrastructure providers,
to healthcare and financial firms have suffered significant magnitude of financial losses
caused by this threat group. While FIN7’s primary objective is to directly steal financial
information, they will also steal sensitive information to sell on underground marketplaces, or
reuse it in their upcoming ransomware attacks. Moreover, the group appears to be as active
as ever, bringing up a relatively greater deal of successful methods on techniques and
attack surfaces ; e.g. utilizing the go-to tools called POWERPLANT, rclone, and so on. The
group has specialized in PowerShell programs and unique commands that can be observed
across malware infections.
PRODAFT Intelligence Team (PTI) puts forward the cybercriminal investigation with its visibility
into critical elements of FIN7 infrastructure and vital data on its kill chain. On top of that, this
report discusses crucial insights of the attack vectors, infection mechanisms and toolkits
used by this group to exploit the network from the initial infection, the operational details,
and regional distribution.

Please note that this report has two versions. The ”Private Release” is provided to
law enforcement agencies, applicable CERTS / CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A.
Threat Intel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the
”Public Release” is publicly disseminated for the purpose of advancing the global fight
against high-end threat actors and APTs.

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

Executive Summary

This report demonstrates the continuous threat intelligence research carried out by the
PRODAFT threat intelligence team (PTI). The main aim is to elaborate on the comprehensive
TTP of the APT group known as FIN7. The data captured by the PTI team contains information
about attack tools used by the FIN7 group, various backup files, and conversation history.
Moreover, in private chats, we identified the inner details of various cyber-attack operations
conducted against large institutions based in the USA and Europe.
The Organizational Structure section of the report further covers and reveals the FIN7 group
hierarchy, disclosing the nicknames and addresses of the members. The group sequence
exhibits clear structures distributed into management, developers, penetration testers and
affiliate positions, essentially making them study the targets’ internal procedures more
efficiently and successfully. PRODAFT is the first organization that gained visibility into the
organizational structure of FIN7 and the real identities of some of its members. Furthermore,
we share information on their account activities that previously involved illegal operations.
During our team’s analysis of Jabber conversation history, we observed that the purpose
of these attacks was to infiltrate the target corporation networks and encrypt valuable
data to request ransom payments from the institutions. After entering the systems of large
to medium-sized organizations, members of the attacker group predominantly deploy
Darkside or REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware on victim computers.
For the purpose mentioned above, threat actors had mainly exploited well-known Microsoft
Exchange vulnerabilities (ProxyShell and ProxyLogon) to gain initial access to their targets
due to the availability of easy-to-use public tools. PTI team also identified that the FIN7
group developed tailored systems to quickly discover and infiltrate the high-value targets
by performing mass scans.
Apart from exploitation to gain initial access, it has been observed that FIN7 also performs
social engineering attacks or uses already stolen enterprise credentials. We discovered
several methods of their e-mail phishing techniques with malicious document attachments,
as briefly analyzed in the corresponding sections of this report. Stolen credentials were
found to be purchased from underground markets and checked with in-house developed
scripts/tools.
The overall tactics and behaviour of the group reveal habitual patterns. After the initial access,
FIN7 proceeds with the execution of the rest of the ransomware attack chain, encrypting the
files, leaving a note inside the targeted systems and directing the institution’s representatives
to the chat platforms hosted inside the TOR network. There they negotiate a ransom payment
in cryptocurrency with their victims ; if the institution refuses to pay the ransom money, the
attacker group publicly shares the files stolen from target institutions on a website in the
TOR network. However, an unusual action after this chain is that they leave an SSH-based
backdoor on the target systems. It has been concluded that the objective of this backdoor
is to re-target the victims with other types of ransomware to gain more profit, whilst this
presumption is echoed by the conversations held among the threat actors.

Furthermore, the PTI team has disclosed that the owner of the obtained data is an active
member of the FIN7 group who is responsible for providing tailored access to the targeted
institutions. The conversation history exposed the fact that the subject threat actor is also
providing tailored access to other ransomware distributors.
Last but not least, the aforementioned behavioural patterns, tactics, techniques and
procedures confirmed that FIN7 attempts to filter and prioritize vulnerable targets in order
to minimize their effort and maximize their profit. They are doing so by considering several
parameters, such as annual revenue, foundation date, and the number of employees in the
company. A specific page discovered in their management panel shows the value of each
vulnerable target. This page demonstrates a particular type of feasibility study considered
a unique behaviour among cyber-crime groups.
The inner workings of FIN7 present an intriguing insight into one of the most notorious and
advanced cybercrime groups. All the provided information allows the readers to make
further deductions while guiding them with a cohesive, meticulously crafted image.

Analyst Note : Although we analyzed millions of lines in Jabber logs, various scripts, and
executable files sizing more than a few GBs in total belonging to the FIN7 group, we are
still looking for possible collaborations with other threat intelligence teams to go over the
remaining parts.

Technical Analysis

The FIN7 group is known for their highly sophisticated and targeted attacks. In this section,
we will uncover the methods and tools used by the FIN7 team to carry out their operations.
This includes details on their infrastructure, attack arsenal, communication environment, initial
vectors, and post-exploitation techniques. We will also discuss one of their most notable
campaigns and the impact they have had on organizations around the world.

4.1

Initial Vectors

The FIN7 hacking group often uses custom scripts to exploit public-facing web
applications. In conversations between group members as shown in below, they have
discussed using the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange applications to run
arbitrary PowerShell scripts on victims’ servers. This allows them to gain unauthorized access
and potentially steal sensitive information.

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

Before using the exploit for CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability, the FIN7 group checks whether or
not the vulnerability exists on the victim servers. Thereon the PTI team found the README file
describing this operation for Exchange servers on detecting vulnerability.

Figure 13. README of the script distributed within the team - Translated from Russian.

With aforesaid, for using exploit against Exchange vulnerability, this threat group purchases
the stolen accounts of OWA on specific internet markets, and examines their validity. A file
README is given below with commands of Python-script for checking accounts (see Figure 14).

Figure 14. Help page of the script distributed within the team - Translated from Russian.

In addition to the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability, the FIN7 team members were quite
interested in other types of Microsoft Exchange exploits, including ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, or
CVE-2021-42321. To take advantage of these vulnerabilities, they developed tailored scripts
to automate the exploitation process. They customized public exploits and sometimes
combined them with zero-day vulnerabilities to create even more effective attacks. It’s likely
that they decided to develop a new system to automate this process, and they created the
tailored system (as described in Section 4.4) for that purpose. This system allowed them to
quickly and efficiently exploit any vulnerable systems they came across.

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

In addition to exploiting the vulnerabilities mentioned above, FIN7 has also been known to
use other attack vectors, such as BadUSB attacks. In March 2020, public reports linked FIN7
to these social engineering attacks, which involve convincing potential victims to plug in USB
flash drives containing malicious code into their computers. We observed several BadUSB
scripts in the team’s toolkit (as shown in Figure 15) and published technical analysis on some
of them 2 .

Figure 15. Excerpt of the FIN7 Team’s attack arsenal - Ready-to-ship flash drives.

In BadUSB attacks, the attacker modifies a USB flash drive to act as a human interface
device (HID), such as a keyboard, and use it to input commands into the victim’s machine. In
FIN7’s BadUSB attacks, they have been known to modify their USBs to act as a keyboard
and simulate keyboard strokes to invoke a malicious Powershell command. However, they
recently added a new SSH-based backdoor (as shown in Figure 16) to their arsenal, which
allows them to steal confidential files from the target system using reverse SSH connections
(SFTP). This adds another layer of sophistication to their attacks and makes it even harder
for victims to detect and defend against them.

mentions attacks on POS machines and manipulations of international payment systems.
From these messages, it appears that Alex is the leader of the FIN7 group, as mentioned

In a conversation, two FIN7 team members were discussing their BadUSB attack payloads,
which had been obtained by antivirus companies. They mentioned that the payloads were
marked as FIN7, which shows that they are aware of and track the activities of security
researchers. This level of awareness and tracking suggests a high level of sophistication
and dedication to their operations. However, threat intelligence efforts have disrupted their
operation and exposed their tactics, making it harder for them to carry out successful attacks.

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

In addition to the tactics and techniques they have already been known to use, the PTI team
has discovered that FIN7 is also affiliated with ransomware groups such as REvil, LockBit,
and Darkside. One of the ways they infiltrate victim networks and subsequently encrypt
their devices is by purchasing stolen authentication data, such as VPN, RDP, Firewall, Email
accounts and other access types used by enterprises. These accounts are typically stolen
by stealer malware and sold on underground markets, where FIN7 and other threat actors
can purchase them. This allows them to gain access to a wide range of systems and carry
out their attacks more easily.

Figure 19. Files containing purchased stolen accounts.

The FIN7 group carefully scrutinizes the validity of stolen accounts and uses a service
like Zoominfo to select the firms and organizations with the highest revenue. Once

determine the ransom amount based on the company’s revenue. A sample file containing
purchased stolen accounts can be seen in Figure 19. This file gives the threat actors
access to all of the victim’s information, including their browser, website URL, username, and

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

In order to maintain versatility and ensure access to as many channels as possible, FIN7
also commonly uses spear phishing as an attack vector. The group members distribute
spam e-mails by demanding payment with an attached malicious file .docm. This file has a
macro script which opens a backdoor in a victim’s device. Figure 20 depicts an example of
a phishing text message sent via e-mail in the Italian language. It is translated as, ”Hello,
Please pay the invoice ; we have not yet received your payment. If the payment has already
been sent, ignore this e-mail. Thank you.”

Figure 20. Phishing E-Mail text.

When the victim opens the attached document, a legitimate message appears that says
”To see the attached document, click on Enable Content.” This allows the malicious script to
be activated on the victim’s computer, opening a backdoor that allows FIN7 to silently gain
access. This is a common trick that attackers use to trick victims into enabling the malicious
content, allowing them to infect the victim’s device without their knowledge.

Attack Arsenal

Throughout our investigation, the FIN7 group consistently used the multi-functional tool
known as Carbanak to open backdoors on victim computers. In July 2020, we published
a technical analysis 3 of Carbanak version 3.7.4, which was compiled in November 2019
according to the PE file header. The interface of the tool is titled ”Command Manager 3.7.4 Russian version. Checkpoint Software Inc.” and has capabilities such as port forwarding,
RDP/VNC access, command line access, file transfer, and more. As previously mentioned in
the report, the keyword ”checkpoint” is often used by Alex (see 3.1), the manager of the FIN7
team. This tool is an important part of FIN7’s arsenal and is used in many of their attacks.

Figure 24. Carbanak Client - Command Manager.

In addition to using Carbanak, FIN7 threat actors are currently developing a new remote
access Trojan (RAT) called Icebot. This new tool has similar capabilities to Carbanak, Lizar,
and Tirion and is being tested in their testing environments. We expect it to be widely
deployed on victim devices in the future. This indicates that FIN7 is continuously evolving
and updating their tactics and tools in order to maintain their ability to carry out successful
attacks.

FIN7 often use tailored, versioned, and highly dynamic PowerShell scripts developed by their
own development team to produce executables for the deployment of fresh instances. These
scripts, along with instructions and public-private keys, are packaged into a deployment
pack (as shown in Figure 27) and distributed among the core team members.

Large-Scale Auto-Attack Campaign

During the investigation, the PTI team noticed a unique system used by the FIN7’s
sub-team that targets the Microsoft Exchange servers and other public-facing applications
in particular by mass scale scanning. The deeper analysis revealed that the attackers
directly scanned and exploited hundreds of Microsoft Exchange servers with Proxyshell
(CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) vulnerabilities.
After the Proxyshell vulnerabilities were announced as part of the April 2021 Microsoft
Exchange Server Security Updates[4], the first proof-of-concept (POC) examples of these
vulnerabilities began to appear in August of that year. Most threat actors, including those
deploying LockFile[1], Babuk[6], and QBot[7], first used these vulnerabilities in August and
September 2021. However, our team discovered that FIN7’s initial operations using these
vulnerabilities started in June 2021, before the public POCs were released. This indicates that
FIN7 was actively monitoring the situation and was able to quickly take advantage of these
new vulnerabilities to carry out their attacks.
Threat actors exploit ProxyShell vulnerabilities to establish remote PowerShell sessions on
the vulnerable Exchange Servers. There are several ways that attackers have used the
PowerShell to create web shells. Following vulnerabilities are observed to be exploited :
: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution(RCE) vulnerability
• CVE-2021-34473
that does not require any user action or privilege to exploit ;
: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability after
• CVE-2021-34523

: Microsoft Exchange Server security feature bypasses vulnerability
• CVE-2021-31207
flaw that allows attackers to gain administrative access.

Exchange Exploitation Module

On June 1, 2021, the FIN7 team created an automated attack system called Checkmarks
using the Django framework. They primarily used the system to scan for exchange servers
and run Microsoft Exchange exploits on them, as seen in the screenshot in Figure 30. This
allowed the team to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in exchange servers worldwide. The
below table shows the details of the tailored system.

After the target domains are added to the panel, the scanner service uses the given IP
addresses to scan the exchange server for OWA files. If an exchange server is detected in
any of the domains, the exploit is applied and a shell is dropped over via Powershell. The
panel not only performs exploitation, but also provides various details on the victim, as seen
in Figure 31.

The FIN7 team successfully carried out exchange server attacks in June 2021 using a custom
exploit code. However, this exploit was later removed from their panel. After September 4,
2021, they began targeting victims using an open source exploit[2], as seen in the log file in
Figure 32. The image below shows a victim that has been successfully scanned and had a
Powershell script run on it. When the Proxyshell attack is successful, post-exploitation steps
are automatically executed, including extracting all emails from Active Directory (AD) and
collecting all Exchange Server information.

The Marketing team at FIN7 first gathers information on potential victims, including their
current revenue, number of employees, headquarter details, domain, and website. They then
share this information with the Pentesters to determine if the victim is a worthwhile target. If
a firm is deemed to have a sufficient market size, the Pentester leaves a comment for the
admin on how the server connection can be used, how long the attack can last, and how
far it can go. This information is used to shape the next stages of the attack. This level of
planning and coordination is not typical among other cybercrime groups and is a distinct
characteristic of FIN7.

Figure 34. Custom auto-attack system - Victim prioritization.

In the remaining section of the Victim company details page, there is a list of the relevant
victims’ AD domains, along with their company URL details and mail information obtained
from the exchange server, as seen in Figure 34. If the company meets the criteria for
targeting, it will be flagged by the threat actor for the admin to see. This allows the FIN7
team to easily identify and prioritize potential victims.

Auto-SQLi Module

In addition to the auto-exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, threat actors
also developed a module for the SQL Injection attacks. In cases where an attack does not
meet a definitive result and cannot be proceeded within the server, the target victim is
marked for scanning by SQLMap tool. Ultimately, all URLs are scanned to acquire if there are
any SQL injection vulnerabilities.

When starting a scan, the OS command parameter is given to SQLMap to collect the tasklist
and domain information of the victim, as shown in Figure 35. The system runs automatically
and provides remote access to attackers from the victim’s internal system if the attack is
successful. Crowdstrike detected the attacks carried out by this system and attributed it to
the FIN7 in one of their posts 6 .

The attack outputs show that the FIN7 team uses specific SQLMap configurations within their
operations (see Figure 36). The team has designed the system to be highly customizable,
allowing them to easily implement new attack modules using different tools like SQLMap.
This flexibility allows the team to adapt to different situations and target a wide range of

Victim Prioritization

The PTI team has shed light on FIN7’s prioritizing of the companies with the highest
revenue to get profitable operations. From their chain attack it is apparent that the
company size, revenue, market capitalization and investment are categories that hold the
greatest significance in their target selection. The goal is not to attack them all, but to
target the companies that will bring them the highest income. Besides the techniques used
in high-profile targeting, the threat group worked with many different services to set targets
and analyze them as provided with an evidence in Figure 37.

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

The Darkside Ransomware team started to attack large companies from more than
15 countries in August 2020. These companies included law firms, financial services,
manufacturing factories and information technologies. Thereupon, the Darkside Ransomware
group was responsible for the infamous Colonial Pipeline attack in May 2021. The attack led
the company to actively and temporarily close the 5500 mile pipelines which in fact carry
approximately 45 percent of fuel used on the east coast of United States. 9 It is noteworthy
to mention that the Darkside group appeared, FIN7 members touched upon the news about
this group in their conversations.

To further confirm the connection, a text file named darkside_readme.txt was discovered in
the infrastructure of the FIN7 team.

Initially, based on further PTI discoveries, there was a discussion led by FIN7 about the
payments that each member receives from the operation. It has been evaluated that from
the amount they receive ; 25% goes to the ransomware owner, 20% to authentication data
of the victim’s network, and the highest amount is received by the head of the team who
deals with ransomware (nickname : Rash). The rest of the money is distributed among the
group members, as indicated in Figure 49

According to the given correspondence among the members, the head of FIN7 decided to
engage in ransomware operations since the POS machines do not bring enough income to
satisfy the members.

To keep the money flowing in, FIN7 members also sell victims’ credit card information to third
parties. As it occurs, they sell the credit card details after the victim pays the ransom for
encrypted information, as seen in Figure 55

Figure 55. Conversation about the selling stolen credit cards.

Ransomware victims normally pay the ransom cost in Bitcoin or Monero cryptocurrencies. In
order to protect themselves while exchanging those cryptocurrencies for another currency
type, they use specific services to get them in cash. Eventually, the obtained money is
delivered to the threat actors by a courier service as they try to remain inconspicuous ; so
the delivery usually takes place when they are in a crowded place.

Victim Re-targeting

Intending to get into the victim’s network, and subsequently encrypt servers and
computers, the threat actors use the access that had been sold on particular internet
markets - those that are specialising in selling stolen victim data. The stolen data are mostly
obtained from the victims’ computers, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the victim’s network.
Once the threat actors have gained access to a victim’s network, they typically install
backdoors to facilitate their ransomware attacks and ensure they are able to collect ransom
payments. After the attack is complete, the group may resell or reuse the access they have
gained to launch additional attacks. Even if the victim takes steps to remove the initial
vulnerabilities, the existing backdoors can continue to provide a means for future infections.
This allows the threat actors to repeatedly target the same victim, potentially causing
significant damage and disruption.

Figure 57. Re-targeting the Victims.

From the text messages that have been acquired it is clear that the exact same actor firstly
uses the malware Sodinokibi, which belongs to REvil. However, after a while, the LockBit
ransomware is used on the same victim (see Figure 57).

Internal Threatening and Member Intimidation

Another shocking revelation clearly indicates that the group members are not always on
good terms among themselves. It has been exposed that the administrator of the group
threatens the team members by insisting that they have to work more while giving them
ultimatums or even threatening to hurt their family members in case of resigning or escaping
from responsibilities. The conversation excerpts illustrating those practices are found in the
figures below.

Statistics and Observations

The analysis of the FIN7 group reaffirms the occurrence of substantially severe infections
worldwide, whilst in almost all cases, the targets are only enterprise-level corporations. Our
PTI team has correlated these victim details gleaned from multiple affiliate accounts and
servers to provide insight into some of FIN7’s behavioural patterns, workflows, and activity
timelines.

Figure 60. Victim distribution of the FIN7 group.

During the investigation, The PTI team identified more than 8,147 FIN7 victims across the
globe, and the majority of victims commonly originated from USA 16.74%. It has been
observed that threat actors often target victims from Russia at a high rate. However, none of
these victims is encountered in the later stages of the attack cycle. This may be because
the attackers are opportunistically targeting a large number of victims and then filtering
them based on certain criteria. As a result, only a small portion of the initial group of victims
are actually affected by the attack. All details regarding the victims’ origins are depicted in
Figure 60.
In addition to mass-scale exploitation and spear-phishing attacks, the FIN7 group has also
been observed using VPN or RDP credentials obtained from underground markets to gain
unauthorized access to victims’ systems. We strongly recommend that organizations take
steps to protect themselves, such as by implementing strong authentication measures like
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), fixing public vulnerabilities, and regularly monitoring for
suspicious activity.

FIN7 Unveiled : A deep dive into notorious cybercrime gang

Conclusion

This report has provided detailed information and unparalleled insights into one of
the notorious threat groups in the cybercrime industry. FIN7 has established itself as an
extraordinarily versatile and well-known APT group that targets enterprise companies. Before
diving into technical analysis and their attack tactics, techniques and procedures, the key
members’ organizational structure and clear hierarchy have been described in further detail.
As has been steadily outlined throughout the report, FIN7 uses various techniques to obtain
the data they are looking for - with the aim to monetize them afterwards. Some of those
techniques include utilizing public exploits, buying stolen credentials from underground
markets, cooperating with other ransomware groups, or using social engineering methods
such as distributing malware through malicious USBs and sending spear-phishing emails.
Despite increased detection solutions and awareness within the targeted sectors, utilizing
public exploits is a powerful approach for gaining access to the victims’ systems. To this date,
the FIN7 group compromised and caused monetary damage to 8,147 victims, predominantly
residing in the USA (16.74%). It is essential to mention that they managed to infiltrate all those
high-profile companies after scanning 1,826,508 targets.
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the toolkits and strategies used by
the FIN7 hacking group. By analyzing these tactics, we can identify potential defenses
against their attacks and aid the intelligence community in their efforts to protect against
future incidents. It is important to note that these attacks are carefully coordinated to
maximize their impact before industry-wide information sharing and countermeasures are
implemented. By understanding the methods used by FIN7, we can take steps to better
protect ourselves and our organizations.
Ultimately, the report elaborates on the FIN7 attack activities and techniques that are
unfortunately gaining popularity in the cybercrime market. The attackers have been
motivated by the vision of financial gains since 2013. As the report confirmed, their signature
move is to thoroughly research the companies based on their revenue, employee count,
headquarters and website information to pinpoint the most profitable targets. Although
they have internal issues related to the unequal distribution of obtained monetary resources
and somewhat questionable practices towards their members, they have managed to
establish a strong presence in the cybercrime sphere. They are a highly structured criminal
organization, as demonstrated by their previous campaigns and comparison with other
hacking groups. They conduct their operations with an exceptionally good access to
resources ranging from financial services to software and valuable networks.
