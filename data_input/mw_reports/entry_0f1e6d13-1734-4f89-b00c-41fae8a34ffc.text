On the 15th of September 2019, we have published a report[1] about a sharp increase in
Charming Kitten attacks against researchers from the US, Middle East, and France, focusing on
Iranian academic researchers, Iranian dissidents in the US. In our last report, we exposed a new
cyber espionage campaign that was conducted in July 2019. Since then, we observed another
wave of these attacks, leveraging new impersonating vectors and IOCs.
Until these days, Iran was not known as a country who tends to interfere in elections around the
world. From a historical perspective, this type of cyber activity had been attributed mainly to the
Russian APT groups such as APT28 (known as Fancy Bear). The group is infamous for hacking
American Democratic National Committee emails and targeting German and French campaign
members, in an attempt to circumvent the elections in the US, Germany, and France.
Microsoft’s October announcement exposes, for the ﬁrst time, that Charming Kitten, an Iranian
APT group, plays a role in the domain of cyber-attacks for the purpose of interfering with
democratic procedures.
On 4th of October 2019[2], Microsoft has announced that Phosphorus (known as Charming Kitten)
attempted to attack email accounts that are associated with the following targets: U.S.
presidential campaign, current, and former U.S. government ofﬁcials, journalists covering global
politics, and prominent Iranians living outside Iran. These spear-phishing attacks were conducted
by Charming Kitten in August and September. We evaluate in a medium-high level of
conﬁdence, that Microsoft’s discovery and our ﬁndings in our previous and existing
reports is a congruent operation.

Our evaluation based on the following issues:
1. Same victim proﬁles – In both cases, the victims were individuals of interest to Iran in the
ﬁelds of academic research, human rights, opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s
regime (such as NIAC) and journalists. Although the congruent is not exactly similar, our
sample is mainly based on Israeli victims.
2. Time overlapping – In our latest report, we mentioned that we have observed an
escalation of the attacks in July-August 2019. In their announcement, Microsoft mentioned
that the attacks occurred on ‘In a 30-day period between August and September’.

3. Similar attack vectors – In both cases, Charming Kitten used similar attack vectors which
are:
1. Password recovery impersonation of the secondary email belonging to the victims in
both cases.
2. Both attack vectors used spear-phishing emails in order to target Microsoft, Google
and Yahoo services.
3. In our research, we identiﬁed a spear-phishing attack via SMS messages, indicating
that Charming Kitten gathers phone numbers of the relevant victim. Microsoft found
that Charming Kitten gathers phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor
authentications of the relevant victims to gain control of their email accounts.
In this report, we uncovered four new spear-phishing methods used by this group, alongside with
new indicators of this operation.
Indicators of compromise are available for subscribers of the ClearSky threat intelligence
service in MISP events 1745.
