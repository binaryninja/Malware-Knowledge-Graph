Malicious spam campaigns delivering banking Trojans

In mid-March 2021, we observed two new spam campaigns. The messages in both cases
were written in English and contained ZIP attachments or links to ZIP files. Further research
revealed that both campaigns ultimately aimed to distribute banking Trojans. The payload in
most cases was IcedID (Trojan-Banker.Win32.IcedID), but we have also seen a few QBot
(Backdoor.Win32.Qbot, also known as QakBot) samples. During campaign spikes we
observed increased activity of these Trojans: more than a hundred detections a day.
IcedID is a banking Trojan capable of web injects, VM detection and other malicious actions.
It consists of two parts – the downloader and the main body that performs all the malicious
activity. The main body is hidden in a PNG image, which is downloaded and decrypted by
the downloader.
QBot is also a banking Trojan. It’s a single executable with an embedded DLL (main body)
capable of downloading and running additional modules that perform malicious activity: web
injects, email collection, password grabbing, etc.

Neither of these malware families are new – we’ve seen them being distributed before via
spam campaigns and different downloaders, like the recently taken-down Emotet. However,
in the recent campaign we observed several changes to the IcedID Trojan.

Technical details
Initial infection
DotDat
The first campaign we called ‘DotDat’. It distributed ZIP attachments that claimed to be some
sort of cancelled operation or compensation claims with the names in the following format
[document type (optional)]-[some digits]-[date in MMDDYYYY format]. We assume the dates
correspond with the campaign spikes. The ZIP archives contained a malicious MS Excel file
with the same name.
The Excel file downloads a malicious payload via a macro (see details below) from a URL
with the following format [host]/[digits].[digits].dat and executes it. The URL is generated
during execution using the Excel function NOW(). The payload is either the IcedID
downloader (Trojan.Win32.Ligooc) or QBot packed with a polymorph packer.

The Excel file contains obfuscated Excel 4.0 macro formulas to download and execute the
payload (IcedID or QBot). The macro generates a payload URL and calls the WinAPI
function URLDownloadToFile to download the payload.

After a successful download, the payload is launched using the EXEC function and Windows
Rundll32 executable.

Summer.gif
The spam emails of the second campaign contained links to hacked websites with malicious
archives named “documents.zip”, “document-XX.zip”, “doc-XX.zip” where XX stands for two
random digits. Like in the first campaign, the archives contained an Excel file with a macro
that downloaded the IcedID downloader. According to our data, this spam campaign peaked
on 17/03/2021. By April, the malicious activity had faded away.

Like in the other case, Excel 4.0 macro formulas and the URLDownloadToFile function are
used in this campaign. The main difference in the download component is that the URL is
stored in a cell inside the malicious file.

Though the URL seems to refer to a file named “summer.gif”, the payload is an executable,
not a GIF image. To execute the payload, the macro uses WMI and regsvr32 tools.

IcedID
As we mention above, IcedID consists of two parts – downloader and main body. The
downloader sends some user information (username, MAC address, Windows version, etc.)
to the C&C and receives the main body. In the past, the main body was distributed as a
shellcode hidden in a PNG image. The downloader gets the image, decrypts the main body
in the memory and executes it. The main body maps itself into the memory and starts to
perform its malicious actions such as web injects, data exfiltration to the C&C, download and
execution of additional payloads, exfiltration of system information and more.
IcedID new downloader
Besides the increase in infection attempts, the IcedID authors also changed the downloader
a bit. In previous versions it was compiled as an x86 executable and the malware
configuration after decryption contained fake C&C addresses. We assume this was done to
complicate analysis of the samples. In the new version, the threat actors moved from x86 to
an x86-64 version and removed the fake C&Cs from the configuration.

Configuration of the old version of IcedID downloader

New version configuration
We also observed a minor change in the malware’s main body. While it’s still distributed as a
PNG image, and the decryption and C&C communication methods remain the same, the
authors decided not to use shellcode. Instead, IcedID’s main body is distributed as a
standard PE file with some loader-related data in the beginning.
Geography of IcedID attacks
Geography of IcedID downloader detections, March 2021 (download)
In March 2021, the greatest number of users attacked by Ligooc (IcedID downloader) were
observed in China (15.88%), India (11.59%), Italy (10.73%), the United States (10.73%) and
Germany (8.58%).

Qbot
Unlike IcedID, QBot is a single executable with an embedded DLL (main body) stored into
the resource PE section. In order to perform traffic interception, steal passwords, perform
web injects and take remote control of the infected system, it downloads additional modules:
web inject module, hVNC (remote control module), email collector, password grabber and
others. All the details on Qbot, as well as IoCs, MITRE ATT&CK framework data, YARA rules
and hashes relating to this threat are available to users of our Financial Threat Intelligence
services.

In March 2021, QBot was also most active in China (10.78%), India (10.78%) and the United
States (4.66%), but we also observed it in Russia (7.60%) and France (7.60%).
