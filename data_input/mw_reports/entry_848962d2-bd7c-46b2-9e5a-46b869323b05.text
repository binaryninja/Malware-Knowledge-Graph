Targeted Threats
By Katie Kleemola and Seth Hardy
August 2, 2013

Background
As part of our ongoing study into targeted attacks on human rights groups and civil society
organizations, the Citizen Lab analyzed a malicious email sent to Tibetan organizations in
June 2013. The email in question purported to be from a prominent member of the Tibetan
community and repurposed content from a community mailing list. Attached to the email
were what appeared to be three Microsoft Word documents (.doc), but which were trojaned
with a malware family we call “Surtr”.1 All three attachments drop the exact same malware.
We have seen the Surtr malware family used in attacks on Tibetan groups dating back to
November 2012.

Delivery Mechanism
While the malicious attachments appear to be DOC files due to their file extension, they are
actually RTFs crafted to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word: CVE-2012-0158.
This particular vulnerability was first exploited in early April 2012 and a patch was released
by Microsoft on April 10, 2012. Currently, the sample is detected as malicious by 34 percent
of antivirus (AV) engines on VirusTotal (VT).

Although CVE-2012-0158 was first published and used in the wild in April 2012, samples
using this template were only initially detected by three AV engines (on VT). Therefore, while
a third of AV engines had a detection signature for CVE-2012-0158 as late as April 2013, it
was possible to design a document using a year old vulnerability that was recognized as
malicious by very few AV products. This number has since risen and it is currently being
detected by 34 percent of the AV products listed on VT.
This vulnerability highlights the need to keep both operating systems and applications up to
date as well as to exercise vigilance concerning links and email attachments.
Malicious attachments with this template all use a similar dropper which originally drops the
payload to the temporary file directory.

Payload
Surtr creates either a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process
using CreateRemoteThread function.
It also creates the following folders:
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/123
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/Burn
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/LiveUpdata_Mem
It creates multiple copies of the payload including in both the Burn and LiveUpdata_Mem
folders. The copy in the Burn folder is called [VICTIM COMPUTER NAME].dll and there are
three copies in the LiveUpdata_Mem folder whose names consist of 6 random alphanumeric
characters which are then appended with .dll, _Fra.dll and _One.dll. These copies will differ
from the original payload dropped in the %TEMP% folder by filling the resource section with
varying amounts of 00 bytes. This also results in the malware having a much larger file size
(30-50mb) possibly in an attempt to evade antivirus heuristics.

Surtr connects to a command and control server (C2) and downloads a stage two
component to %ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/Burn/_[VICTIM
COMPUTER NAME].log. This particular sample connects to internet.3-a.net on port 9696.
In May 2012, internet.3-a.net resolved to the same IP (184.82.123.143) as
android.uyghur.dnsd.me, which is a C2 used in Android malware attacks that targeted the
Tibetan community as previously documented by the Citizen Lab.
The stage two component that was downloaded in this particular case has an internal name
of x86_GmRemote.dll, however we have seen an alternate stage two used with the name
Remote.dll as well. Our analysis in this post focuses on the GmRemote variation as it has
been seen in multiple attacks.
Surtr’s capabilities include listing of file directories and contents on the victim computer and
any USB drives connected to a victim machine, viewing web cache, executing remote
commands and logging keystrokes.
In order to store temporary information, Surtr creates the following folders:
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/MpCache
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_DiskLoydb
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_KeyLoydb
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_skins
%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/UsbLoydb
For example, in nView_DiskLoydb, a file called FileList.db that contains file and directory
listings will be placed and nView_KeyLoydb will contain text files with keylogger output. The
keylogger output is disguised by adding a constant to the ordinal value of the character.
This data can then be sent to the C2. It is compressed using zlib DEFLATE so the network
traffic is not human readable without decompression.
It can also download additional malware onto the victim computer, which can provide
attackers with further abilities like accessing the victim computer’s webcam or microphone. In
particular, we have seen Surtr used in conjunction with the Gh0st RAT derived LURK0
malware.
For persistency, Surtr adds a key to the registry to ensure it runs when the infected computer
is restarted. It also stores its C2 information and a campaign code in the registry.

Other Samples & Variations
We have seen a large number of similar samples sent to Tibetan groups that use the same
stage two (GmRemote) and communicate with the following C2s: dtl.dnsd.me, dtl.eatuo.com,
dtl6.mooo.com and tbwm.wlyf.org. These C2s were also used in previous attacks
documented in an earlier Citizen Lab post on LURK0 malware targeting the Tibetan
community.
One particular sample (md5: ad9e5f79585eb62bc40b737e98bfd62e) which connects to C2
domain dtl6.mooo.com (which resolved to the same IP as the other dtl domains mentioned
above) on port 6178 was seen to download LURK0 malware after the initial Surtr infection.
This LURK0 sample had the campaign code ZQ6 that connects to C2 domain tbwm.wlyf.org
on port 3103. This domain also resolved to the same IP as the dtl domains.
We have also found reports of other Surtr stage 2 (GmRemote) samples that have campaign
codes which suggest they may be targeted at commercial and government targets.
The first sample was found via ThreatExpert. It uses campaign code kmlg-0308, and
connects to a C2 at flyoutside.com. This domain and eight others are registered to
toucan6712@163.com:

www.paulfrank166.2waky.com (192.198.85.102), campaign code 0201-2116
44758b9a7a6cafd1b8d1bd4c773a2577 – connects to C2 domain www.flyoutside.com (same
as the first sample found on ThreatExpert), campaign code lg-0109
Most of these samples have campaign codes that suggest commercial targets. However, we
do not have information about where these samples were submitted from, so the target
sector and victims cannot be confirmed.
A second GmRemote sample was found via the web, called Trojan/Subxe.89E1 by Anchiva.
This sample connects to google.djkcc.com and uses campaign code in1102. Other
subdomains under djkcc.com include:
airforce.djkcc.com
domain.djkcc.com
google.djkcc.com
indianembassy.djkcc.com
mailnic.djkcc.com (MailNIC is an Indian email site at the National Informatics Centre)
microsoft.djkcc.com
rediffmail.djkcc.com (Rediffmail is an Indian email site)
While we do not have information about what victims these samples target, the campaign
code, C2 domain, and related subdomains give some possible indications.
One additional find via VTI is a GmRemote sample internally named:
GmKeyBoradServer_DLL.dll (MD5 e7e1c69496ad7cf093945d3380a2c6f4).
It exports functions (GmFunctionType, GmInitPoint, GmMyInitPoint, GmRecvPoint,
GmShutPoint, GmVerSion) that are referenced in other GmRemote samples, although none
of them have any real content.
These additional samples suggest that Surtr is being used to target groups beyond the
Tibetan community and is possibly being utilized by multiple threat actors.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The attacks we have observed that use the Surtr malware family are another example of the
persistent targeted malware campaigns the Tibetan community faces. The specific attack
reported in this post demonstrates that attackers are actively monitor mailing lists and
discussion groups used by the Tibetan community and repurpose the content for use in
targeted malware attacks.
For communities under persistent threat from targeted malware campaigns, user vigilance
and education are essential for reducing risk.
7/9

Users should carefully examine the sender’s email address of emails and exercise
caution in opening unexpected or unsolicited attachments or opening unverified links.
See Citizen Lab’s Recommendations for defending against targeted cyber threats for
additional information, and Tibet Action Institute’s Detach from Attachments and Think
Before You Click campaigns.
The Citizen Lab is continuing to monitor targeted malware campaigns using Surtr and will
post updates as they are available.

1 Surtr is a fire giant in Norse Mythology. We chose Surtr as this malware family’s namesake

because the malware creates a folder named ‘Burn’
