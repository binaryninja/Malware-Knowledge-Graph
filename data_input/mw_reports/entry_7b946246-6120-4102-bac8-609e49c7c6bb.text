Mummy Spider (TA542, Emotet) recently resumed their malicious activity with the notorious information-stealing
malware, Emotet, after a year-long hiatus.[1] As part of this return, the Emotet malware has been observed delivered
via the TrickBot malware, which is organized by the Wizard Spider (TrickBot, UNC1878) group.[2]
Emotet and Trickbot are dangerous families that have undergone numerous changes and upgrades over years, with
Emotet being first discovered in 2014 and TrickBot in 2016.[3] The longevity of these malware families, even with
international law enforcement taking down Emotet infrastructure as of January 2021, showcases the relentless nature
of the threat actors behind them.
To assist in helping the community, especially with the online shopping season upon us, Anomali Threat Research has
made available two threat actor focused dashboards: Mummy Spider and Wizard Spider, for Anomali ThreatStream
customers. The Dashboards are preconfigured to provide immediate access and visibility into all known Mummy
Spider and Wizard Spider indicators of compromise (IOCs) made available through commercial and open-source
threat feeds that users manage on ThreatStream.
Customers using ThreatStream, Anomali Match, and Anomali Lens are able to immediately detect any IOCs present in
their environments and quickly consume threat bulletins containing machine-readable IOCs. This enables analysts to
quickly operationalize threat intelligence across their security infrastructures, as well as communicate to all
stakeholders if/how they have been impacted.
Anomali recently added thematic dashboards that respond to significant global events as part of ongoing product
enhancements that further automate and speed essential tasks performed by threat intelligence and security
operations analysts. In addition to Mummy Spider and Wizard Spider, ThreatStream customers currently have access
to multiple dashboards announced as part of our November quarterly product release.
Customers can integrate the Mummy Spider and Wizard Spider dashboard, among others, in the “+ Add Dashboard”
tab in the ThreatStream console:
