Part 1: Waterbear Malware
In April 2020, highly malicious cyber activity was detected in several Taiwan government agencies. In one
environment alone, out of the thousands of endpoints scanned, 30 endpoints were confirmed to be infected, and
10 high-risk endpoints were connected by these compromised endpoints. 10 key malware were discovered
during these sophisticated targeted attacks — most of them were Waterbear Loader malware.
This article is Part 1 of a series of articles. Click here to read Part 2: Owlproxy Malware.

1/11

CyCraft AIR assigns Threat Level 10 to the most severe and most damaging malware.

Highlighted Tactics
The attackers discovered and leveraged a weak point in trusted and commonly used data loss prevention (DLP)
software in order to trigger malware and maintain persistence. The government agencies targeted for attack in
April 2020 had already been compromised prior to the April attacks; however, CyCraft AIR (our automated
detection and response platform) discovered that not all the malware from the previous attack was removed
during another vendor’s IR investigation, allowing the attackers to use the previously compromised endpoints
yet again.
The discovered Waterbear Loader malware used several methods to evade defense. (Each method will be
expanded upon later in the article.)
DLL hijacking to stealthily trigger next stage malware
Enlarging binary size to bypass scanning protocols
Heaven’s Gate to avoid antivirus detection
Forcing DLLs to unload to obfuscate malware
Padding memory with Kernel32 content to confuse analyses

Network Level Activity
The attackers first compromised a user’s endpoint to harvest administrative credentials. The credentials were
then utilized to RDP a web server. With the connectivity of the web server, the attackers “net use” through
(proxying) the webserver, allowing them to distribute malware directly to other endpoints.
As mentioned before, several malware was not removed from a previous IR investigation. One endpoint in the
victim’s private network was still compromised. The attackers used this previously compromised endpoint in the
victim’s private network as the C2 server for this attack.

System Level Activity
DLL Hijacking
One key feature of this attack was DLL Hijacking.

What is DLL Hijacking?
2/11

A DLL hijacking attack exploits the Windows search and load mechanism, allowing attackers to inject code into
applications through disk manipulation. By simply injecting a DLL file in the right location, attackers can cause
vulnerable applications to load malicious DLLs.
The attackers leveraged a DLL hijacking vulnerability in the DLP software to enlarge its defensive evasion
capability and to persistently trigger next-stage malware. However, the DLP software failed to verify the integrity
of their loaded DLLs. Thus the DLP software loaded the malicious DLL with high privilege.

The attacker modified LOG4C.DLL to implant a new entry in the import table. The new entry will enforce the
DLP software to load the malicious SecureFile.dll (or LIBDIG.dll). The loaded DLL then injects shellcode to
system services, including Winmgmt, sens, Wuauserv and LanmanServer. Then, the next-stage malware
payload is invoked to communicate to the C2 server.

3/11

Increased Size
File-based scanners sometimes skip the scanning of larger files to maintain performance. The attackers
enlarged the file size to bypass scanning altogether. The original size of file oci[.]dll is 66.5 KB however, as the
above screenshot of CyberTotal demonstrates, oci[.]dll had been enlarged to 130 MB. Thus allowing it to be
ignored by numerous security scanning tools.

Windows IKEEXT Service Abuse

4/11

The threat actor made use of Windows IKEEXT Service to load even more malware into memory —
WLBSCTRL.DLL. Windows IKEEXT Service is a service for APN authentication that is disabled in the default
Windows setting. This service is widely abused by attackers we observe.

RICH Header

The Waterbear Loader malware resurrected a 10-year-old antivirus evasion technique known as Heaven’s Gate.
In this particular case, the attackers applied Heaven’s Gate to inject shellcode into the 64-bit system service
from 32-bit WoW64.
Just as 64-bit and 32-bit programs are quite different, so are analysis mechanisms. Malware equipped with
Heaven’s Gate contains both 64-bit and 32-bit parts. Therefore, some monitor/analysis systems will only apply
32-bit analysis and will fail the 64-bit part; thus, this approach will break some monitor/analysis mechanisms.

5/11

Waterbear Loader forced itself to be unloaded, allowing it to evade detection from some memory forensic tools.

What is Heaven’s Gate?
This antivirus evasion technique permits 32-bit malware to hide API calls by switching to a 64-bit
environment. Malware typically remains hidden inside the loader making it difficult for the AV to detect.
While Heaven’s Gate was first considered to be an advanced technique, over the last decade the
Heaven’s Gate exploit has been observed in more and more rootkits as well as other malware, such as
the infamous Emotet trojan.
Even though usage of the Heaven’s Gate spread, Microsoft’s release of Control Flow Guard (CFG) in
Windows 10 immediately hindered the exploit’s effectiveness as CFG prevented code jumps from WoW64
32-bit execution to native 64-bit code execution space. However, like most exploits, attackers still equip
them when targeting legacy systems and the like — further demonstrating the need for organizations to
update defenses early and update them often.

Behavior

6/11

1. Waterbear Loader first checks whether the current execution context is WoW64, and looks for Winmgmt,
sens, Wuauserv, LanmanServer to inject the shellcode.
2. Then, Waterbear Loader uses xor to decrypt strings in file with key 0x2a361c78
3. Waterbear Loader reads the encrypted payload. In this case: C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\TrayBar.admx
4. Then uses RC4 to decrypt it with key:
690c402f435878175d454028455a751b5372791e4358750c4359720b76626e1953747d0a0457781552361c78
5. In an attempt to further confuse analysis, Waterbear Loader padded contents from Kernel32.dll in front of
and behind their shellcode.
6. Used x64_InjectShellcode to inject shellcode to the previously found service by Heaven’s Gate.
7. In the end, the LdrData data is modified and forced to free the library by FreeLibraryAndExitThread.

Mitigation
1. Add listed IOCs to preventative solution blacklists.
2. Adjust detection and response solutions to detect listed IOCs.
3. Meticulously tracking down the root cause of the attack (not just the endpoint) and thoroughly removing
malware is not only paramount in an IR investigation but could also prevent future attacks.
4. As DLP software is widely deployed in sensitive organizations, is daily-used software, and often has high
privilege, DLP vendors and customers both need to constantly be striving on hardening security to maintain
resilience even in the worst of situations.
5. Do not rely on a one-solution security policy. Preventative solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus) and DLP
solutions are no longer enough to maintain resilience during an attack of this sophistication. AI-driven detection
and response solutions, such as our award-winning CyCraft AIR, not only reduce mean dwell time but also
increase SOC efficiency, automate investigations, and reduce alert fatigue.
