COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Plaintiff Google LLC ("Google") for its Complaint against the Defendants listed below
alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1.

Malicious software, or "malware," finds its way onto unsuspecting victims'

computers through a number of different distribution methods. One of the primary means of
distributing malware is through using illegally "cracked" software, 1 which purports to be
innocuous third party software, that can be modified to surreptitiously install malware on a user's
device, such as a computer. Users download such cracked software and install on their
computers, thus infecting their computer with malware.
2.

CryptBot is a kind of malware that is commonly spread through the distribution of

cracked software, as described above. The Defendants are engaged in the distribution of
CryptBot malware designed to steal sensitive information from victims' computers, through

1 "Cracked software" refers to software that has been modified without authorization from its owner, typically to
undermine technical protection measures designed to prevent copying. The term "cracked software" in this
Complaint refers to all maliciously modified software, including freely available software that is distributed by its
developer without technical protection measures.

websites that distribute “cracked” software (“Malware Distribution Enterprise”). Defendants’
criminal scheme is perpetrated via a pay-per-install (“PPI”) network known as “360installer,”
which fosters the creation of websites that offer illegally modified software (“Cracked Software
Sites”).2 These websites offer software infected with CryptBot malware, such as maliciously
modified versions of Google Chrome and Google Earth Pro, and also cracked third party
software. The Malware Distribution Enterprise operated by Defendants in this case is one of the
primary means of spreading the CryptBot malware to new victims.
3.

CryptBot is malware often referred to as an “infostealer” because it is designed to

steal user information from victims’ computers such as social media account logins, website
logins, browser cookies, credit cards, and cryptocurrency wallets. Such information is uploaded
to the CryptBot botnet command-and-control (“C2”) server, and then sold for use in malicious
computer hacking campaigns with serious consequences for victims. 3
4.

CryptBot is designed to target the users of certain Internet browsers including

Google Chrome. Once executed, the CryptBot malware checks the infected computer for an
installation of Google Chrome, and then attempts to locate, collect, and extract user credentials
saved to Google Chrome.
5.

Google brings this action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt

Organizations Act (“RICO”), Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), Lanham Act, and New
York state common law against Defendants’ criminal enterprise to disrupt the Malware
Distribution Enterprise and the CryptBot botnet, to prevent it from causing further harm to users,
and to recover damages for the harm Google has already endured.

10.

Pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1057(b), Google’s

registrations for the Google Marks constitute prima facie evidence of their validity and of
Google’s exclusive right to use the marks in connection with the identified goods and services.
11.

Google has expended substantial time, money, and other resources in developing,

advertising, and promoting the Google Marks. The Google Marks have been the subject of
substantial and continuous marketing and promotion by Google since as early as 1997.
12.

The Google Marks are distinctive and identify goods and services as originating

from, endorsed by, or otherwise affiliated with Google.
Defendants
13.

The defendants listed in paragraphs 14 through 17 are individuals who have

conspired to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. They each have participated in the
operation or management of the Malware Distribution Enterprise and have engaged in criminal
acts causing harm to Google and countless others.
14.

Defendant Zubair Saeed is an individual who resides in Pakistan.

15.

Defendant Raheel Arshad is an individual who resides in Pakistan.

16.

Defendant Mohammad Rasheed Siddiqui is an individual who resides in Pakistan

(Defendants Zubair Saeed, Raheel Arshad, and Mohammad Rasheed Siddiqui, collectively,
referred to as the “Malware Distribution Defendants”).
17.

Plaintiff does not know the true names and capacities of the operators of the

CryptBot botnet (the “CryptBot Defendants”), and therefore sues these defendants by the
fictitious names Does 1 through 15. Each of the Doe Defendants is responsible in some manner
for the conduct alleged, having agreed to become part of the Malware Distribution Enterprise in
an effort to distribute CryptBot malware that forms the larger botnet.
5

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
18.

This Court has federal question jurisdiction over Google’s claims under RICO,

the CFAA, and the Lanham Act. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law
claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. The state law claims asserted herein are intimately related to the
RICO, CFAA, and Lanham Act claims, are built on the same factual predicates, and are part of
the same controversy.
19.

Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this district, and the exercise of

jurisdiction over Defendants is proper pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964 and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 301 and
302 (McKinney 2022). Defendants have transacted business and engaged in tortious conduct in
the United States and in New York that gives rise in part to Google’s claims. Defendants have
also engaged in intentional, wrongful, illegal, and/or tortious acts, the effects of which
Defendants knew and intended would be felt in the United States and New York. Defendants
have intentionally distributed maliciously modified software, leveraging infrastructure hosted in
New York, caused malware to be installed on victims’ machines in this district, in New York,
and throughout the United States; have intentionally directed victims’ machines in this district, in
New York, and throughout the United States to participate in intentional, wrongful, illegal,
and/or tortious acts. Defendants were aware of the effects in the United States and New York of
those acts; the activities of their co-conspirators and agents were to the benefit of Defendants;
and their co-conspirators and agents were working at the direction, under the control, at the
request, and/or on behalf of Defendants in committing those acts.
20.

Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c) because

Defendants are not residents of the United States and may be sued in any judicial district. Venue
is also proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and 18 U.S.C. § 1965 because a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Google’s claims occurred in this judicial
6

district, because part of the property that is the subject of Google’s claims is situated in this
judicial district, because a substantial part of the harm caused by Defendants has occurred in this
judicial district, and because Defendants transact their affairs in this judicial district. Defendants
avail themselves of the privilege of conducting business in New York, and utilize
instrumentalities located in this judicial district to carry out acts alleged herein.
21.

Defendants have affirmatively directed actions at New York and the Southern

District of New York by targeting their activities, including theft of funds and information, at
individual computer users located in the Southern District of New York. Defendants have
distributed maliciously modified software to and directed harmful computer code at the
computers of individual users located in New York and the Southern District of New York.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Pay-Per-Install Networks
22.

“Pay-Per-Install” or “PPI” refers to a service designed to generate and direct

Internet traffic so that users download and then install a particular file. PPI services offer the
ability to attract users to download a particular file or link provided by a customer. That
customer is usually a developer seeking to find users to download and install a particular file.
The developer pays the PPI service for each user installation. A PPI service will often have a
network of different domain names and websites to generate and maintain a user base to whom
they target download links. Accordingly, a single PPI service may be associated with hundreds
of seemingly unrelated websites.
23.

The ultimate value of a PPI service relies upon the developer’s ability to convert

installations into revenue, since the developer has to pay the PPI service. When a developer
wants to use a PPI service to promote the distribution of its software, the goal is to generate a
profit. In other words, a developer hires a PPI because it has devised a way to make money off

7

the cracked software installation. In some cases, the value of paying a fee to the PPI is tied the
developer’s ability to convert users from the free, demonstration (“demo”) version of the
software to the paid version. This is not the case when it comes to cracked software (since the
entire point of cracked software is that it is “free”), which has a different revenue model. For
“cracked” software distributed with PPIs, a developer’s revenue model is typically stealing
information from the users that click the promoted installation files.
24.

For PPIs that advertise the free distribution of cracked software, the websites that

are created to host the installation links typically advertise that they are cracked versions of
otherwise legitimate software. These websites are created by the PPI’s affiliates. PPI affiliates
create or manage the websites the PPIs use to promote a developer’s installation links. On
information and belief, malicious hackers use cracked software as a vehicle to distribute malware
because users downloading such software are less likely to make a formal complaint or to
exercise good cyber hygiene.
25.

Cracked software PPIs, which already operate outside of the law by distributing

cracked software in violation of intellectual property laws, are aware that their sites are
associated with the distribution of malware and often use a wide collection of seemingly
unrelated domain names and website addresses in order to obfuscate their illicit conduct.
Distribution of “Cracked” Software as a Means for Spreading Malware
26.

Cracked software is typically downloaded by users looking for free versions of

paid products, but malware is also often distributed in maliciously modified versions of software
programs that developers, including Google, make freely available to users. In some instances,
the cracked software retains all or most of the legitimate software’s functionality.

8

27.

PPI networks that focus on the distribution of malware are aware that their paying

developer customers pay them from the proceeds of malicious computer hacking. 4 PPI networks
distribute their customers’ installation links through “affiliate” webpage developers. PPI
networks pay their affiliates a fee for every installation their webpage generates. 5 PPIs pay this
fee from their customers’ payment of the PPI service for the installations. PPIs have a network of
different affiliate websites they can use to promote their developers’ customer software.
28.

When a user downloads software, whether legitimate or maliciously modified,

they typically have to run an executable file that will either install the software from the
downloaded file itself or run an installer application that pulls in relevant install files from the
Internet. Because users expect to run an executable file to install software, users typically do not
realize that the installer is installing malware, in addition to the desired software. And a user’s
subsequent attempt to uninstall the maliciously modified software would not remove any
malware deployed from the initial installation.
29.

When PPI networks are identified as sharing maliciously modified software, they

are often the subject of complaints by the legitimate software developers who demand removal
of the offending material. PPI networks that ignore these demands (and continue to advertise
their services) have a reputation as providers who are willing to distribute digital contraband
including malicious software. In such instances, and upon information and belief, the PPI
networks and their customers are aware that the software they distribute is not provided or
sanctioned by its legitimate owners, and that the customer responsible for that maliciously

4

This Complaint recognizes that “hacking” is a term that can describe both malicious and non-malicious conduct
and specifies that it is referring to malicious “hacking” that represents the unauthorized access of a computer system
for purposes of fraud or other malicious conduct.
5
For example, the 360installer website discussed below advertises that it pays $2 per installation.

9

modified product must monetize installations in order to pay the PPI network’s per-installation
fees.
The CryptBot Botnet
30.

A “bot” (short for “robot”) is a computer or device that is infected by malware

and that can be tasked to conduct specific activities. A “botnet” is a network of internetconnected devices (bots), each of which are infected by malware. The botnet is controlled by
“command-and-control” (“C2”) servers, which can instruct the devices comprising the botnet to
perform any number of disruptive or even criminal tasks. The C2 servers typically are controlled
remotely by individual operators, referred to as “bot controllers.” While a botnet may operate
through various pieces and iterations of malware used to access and control computers without
authorization, the term itself describes the resulting network of computers that can be controlled
by a malicious actor or actors for one or more malicious purposes.
31.

A botnet can leverage its infected computers in many different ways, and different

botnets may have different foci. The CryptBot botnet specifically focuses on the theft of user
information related to authentication, such as credentials, certain computer and browser
identifying information, cryptocurrency account information, and other personal information
about a computer’s user.
32.

CryptBot was initially identified in 2019, but made a resurgence in early 2022.

While CryptBot has been known to be distributed through the use of phishing emails, the most
recent open source intelligence from various security analysts notes that one of CryptBot’s
primary distribution methods is through websites—such as the Cracked Software Sites—that
offer links to cracked software.6

6

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revamped-cryptbot-malware-spread-by-pirated-software-sites/

10

33.

CryptBot is coded, operated, and managed by the CryptBot Defendants. CryptBot

leverages multiple distribution methods, but focuses heavily on distribution through cracked
software sites generally.
34.

CryptBot is designed to automatically identify and steal sensitive information

from the computers it infects and then send the stolen data to C2 servers to be harvested and
eventually transferred or sold to hackers to use in connection with data breach campaigns.
Malicious hackers who target large computer networks will usually incorporate the use of stolen
account credentials throughout the course of their hacking campaign. These can be used to gain
an initial foothold into an organization’s network, or to help a threat actor move laterally within a
breached network once they are inside.
35.

CryptBot is designed to target the users of a number of specific Internet browsers,

including Google Chrome. Once executed, the CryptBot malware checks the infected machine
for installation of Google Chrome, and then attempts to locate, collect, and extract user
credentials saved to Google Chrome. Additionally, CryptBot is coded to take screenshots and
steal data stored by users in Chrome Extensions. The CryptBot Defendants recently released an
update to the CryptBot malware specifically designed to overcome certain limitations in its
ability to steal information associated with the latest version of Chrome, showing that the
botnet’s creators have and continue to specifically adapt the malware to target Google Chrome
and its users.
36.

Today’s malicious hacker has online access to a myriad of tools and services to

support their nefarious conduct. Typically, a malicious threat actor hacking an organization’s
network may use a large number of stolen credentials that are purchased from an online illicit
marketplace (“Stolen Credential Vendors”).

11

37.

Upon information and belief, credentials stolen by the CryptBot malware are

primarily monetized through the trafficking of such stolen credentials and other sensitive
information (such as social security numbers and credit card information) through Stolen
Credential Vendors.
The Cracked Software Sites
38.

The Malware Distribution Enterprise leverages the “360installer” PPI service that

maintains approximately 161 active domains, each of which is associated with the Cracked
Software Sites as part of its distribution network.
39.

The Malware Distribution Defendants work together to maintain and support the

Cracked Software Sites, which distribute cracked software in order to attract users to their
customers’ (the CryptBot Defendants’) download links in return for payment from the CryptBot
Defendants as set forth below.
40.

Specifically, the Malware Distribution Defendants operate the PPI business

known as 360installer as well as its associated bulletproof hosting service, “Offshoric.” As a part
of their service model, the Malware Distribution Defendants incentivize the creation of cracked
software sites by paying their affiliates a fee for every installation that results from a download
from that affiliate’s site. See Declaration of David J. Youssef (“FTI Decl.”) ¶¶ 6-12, 16-24.
According to the Malware Distribution Defendants’ 360installer.com website, affiliates are paid
$2 per installation. Id. ¶ 17.
41.

In order to pay this fee and also turn a profit, the Malware Distribution

Defendants work with the CryptBot Defendants, who monetize the installations through the theft
and eventual sale of sensitive, stolen information. This criminal activity funds 1) the sustaining
operation of the Malware Distribution Defendants’ PPI service and its Cracked Software Sites;
2) the promotion of the PPI service’s affiliates; and 3) creation of additional websites for
12

maliciously modified software, creating more opportunities for the CryptBot Defendants to
spread CryptBot. Id. ¶¶ 57-59.
42.

The Malware Distribution Defendants and the CryptBot Defendants share and

jointly pursue the same goal: profit from the distribution of CryptBot malware through cracked
software installation files seeded with malware. The Malware Distribution Defendants maintain
the Cracked Software Sites, which use the allure of free and popular software, to sustain an
infrastructure that directs Internet traffic to download CryptBot, infecting more computers.
43.

Websites such as the Cracked Software Sites are subject to being taken down by

legal authorities or private parties pursuant to law enforcement activity, legal process, or cease
and desist letters related to violations of intellectual property rights. Accordingly, many such
websites are hosted by what are known in the hacking community as “bulletproof” hosters.
“Bulletproof” hosters are web hosting services that turn a blind eye to illegal content and will
ignore or evade legitimate complaints or legal process to remove or take down the offending
content.
44.

The Cracked Software Sites are hosted by a number of different web hosting

providers, but a majority of these sites are hosted by OffShoric, a “bulletproof” web hosting
service owned and operated by the Malware Distribution Enterprise. Id. ¶¶ 11, 16, 54.
45.

The “About Us” page on OffShoric’s website lists Defendants Saeed and Siddiqui

as “Founders” of OffShoric, and has links under the “Trusted Clients” section to a number of
Cracked Software Sites that blatantly advertise cracked software.
The Malware Distribution Enterprise Distributes Cracked Google Software and CryptBot
46.

The Malware Distribution Enterprise offers maliciously modified versions of

Google software to its users.

13

47.

In a number of instances, the Malware Distribution Enterprise follows their usual

model of soliciting affiliates to create webpages advertising cracked versions of software that
otherwise requires a licensing fee but ultimately delivers malware. In other instances, and in
particular with Google products that are otherwise free to users such as Google Earth Pro and
Google Chrome, the Malware Distribution Enterprise uses installer packages bearing Google
trademarks to deliver malware. Analysis of these software packages reveals that they redirect
users to a series of hacker-related infrastructure that assess certain aspects of the computer (e.g.,
its operating system and browser versions) to identify whether affiliate malware would be
effective on the relevant machine. If so, malware is installed on the machine.
48.

Paragraphs 49 through 51 provide some examples of the Cracked Software Sites

used by the Malware Distribution Enterprise to distribute CryptBot.
49.

“Mazterize.net” is a Cracked Software Site.
a. Below is a screen capture from Mazterize.net:

14

b. “Mazterize.com” is a related site, using the “.com” top-level domain. Below is
a screen capture from “Mazterize.com”:

50.

“SadeemAPK” is a Cracked Software Site with the domain name sadeemapk.com.

Below is a screen capture from SadeemAPK.

15

51.

“CracksFiles” is a Cracked Software Site with the domain name cracksfiles.com.

Below is a screen capture of CracksFiles from February 2023. As recently as March 1, 2023, the
links on the CracksFiles page have been removed.

52.

The Malware Distribution Enterprise is a major distribution arm for CryptBot. Of

the 161 domains associated with the Cracked Software Sites that were active on March 3, 2023
(the “Active Domains”), approximately 90 are associated with the delivery of malware, and
approximately 29 are confirmed to be associated with CryptBot. Additionally, the Cracked
Software Sites include an additional 14 inactive domains that have historically been used by the

16

Malware Distribution Enterprise to distribute CryptBot. All of the Cracked Software Sites listed
in paragraphs 49 through 51 have been associated with the distribution of CryptBot malware.
53.

While a significant portion of the Active Domains were associated with CryptBot

at the time of testing,7 the domains associated with both the Cracked Software Sites and
CryptBot C2 infrastructure change dynamically. CryptBot is known to be generally distributed
through “phishing emails and cracked software,” 8 and has been described as “one of the most
actively-changing malware with distribution pages constantly being distributed.” 9 Accordingly,
at any given point in time, only a portion of the Cracked Software Sites are likely to include
installation files that lead to the distribution of CryptBot. This allows both the Malware
Distribution Defendants and the CryptBot Defendants to more effectively keep their distribution
pages online. As set forth above, CryptBot targets Google users’ information and Google
products once it is installed on a machine, and CryptBot has been updated specifically in order to
make it more effective against later versions of Google software.
Harm to Google, its Users, and the Public
54.

The Malware Distribution Enterprise harms Google, its users, and the public in

two distinct, but related ways.
55.

First, the Malware Distribution Enterprise relies on attracting users that are

willing to click on links that the Cracked Software Sites promote. In doing so the Malware
Distribution Enterprise harms the legitimate owners of such software, including Google (in the
case of Google Chrome and Google Earth Pro).

56.

Monetization of the Cracked Software Sites by the Malware Distribution

Enterprise ultimately relies on the malicious theft (and sale) of sensitive information, including
user credentials, to monetize both the operation of the CryptBot botnet as well as the Cracked
Software Sites. As alleged in paragraph 34, although CryptBot is designed to steal information
associated with many different browsers and applications, it also specifically targets Google
Chrome users. Accordingly, the distribution of CryptBot harms not only Google Chrome users,
but tarnishes the product’s reputation as a secure browsing platform.
57.

The owners of infected devices are harmed in numerous ways, including through

the unauthorized access and criminal misuse of their device or information stolen from the same.
58.

Beyond Google and Google users, the continued proliferation of malware via the

Cracked Software Sites harms the Internet as a whole. Based on an assessment of web traffic
associated with the Cracked Software Sites connected to the distribution of CryptBot, these sites
alone have led to approximately 672,220 CryptBot infections a year. FTI Decl. ¶ 63. Each
infection can lead to the theft of user information that is leveraged in malicious hacking.
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
CLAIM 1
Violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c)–(d) as to all Defendants
59.

Google incorporates by reference each and every foregoing paragraph of the

Complaint as if set forth in full.
60.

At all relevant times, Google is a person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §

1961(3).
61.

At all relevant times, Google is a “person injured in his or her business or

property by reason of a violation of” RICO within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).

18

62.

At all relevant times, each Defendant is a person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.

§§ 1961(3) and 1964(c).
The RICO Enterprise
63.

The Defendants are a group of persons associated together in fact for the common

purpose of carrying out an ongoing criminal enterprise, as described in the foregoing paragraphs
of this Complaint; namely, the Malware Distribution Enterprise, which distributes malware
through the distribution of illegally cracked software via the Cracked Software Sites.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Predicate Acts
64.

At all relevant times, the Defendants conducted or participated, directly or

indirectly, in the conduct, management, or operation of the Malware Distribution Enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) and in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), with such conduct and activities affecting interstate and foreign
commerce.
65.

Defendants have directly or indirectly engaged in an unlawful pattern of

racketeering activity involving thousands of RICO predicate offenses, including violations of the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)), incorporated as a RICO predicate
act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(G) and 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B); wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343); identity fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1028); and access device fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1029).
66.

Google was injured in its business and property by reason of the Defendants’

violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), as described herein. These injuries are a direct, proximate, and
reasonably foreseeable result of these violations, and Google will continue to be harmed.
67.

Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Google is entitled to recover treble damages plus

costs and attorneys’ fees from the Defendants.

19

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants
68.

RICO provides, in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(G), that any act indictable under 18

U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B) constitutes a RICO predicate act. Among the acts that are indictable
under 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B) are violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)—a provision of
the CFAA—if such violation results in damage as defined in §1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(VI).
69.

The Defendants have violated and continue to violate the CFAA, 18 U.S.C. §

1030(a)(5)(A), resulting in damage as defined in Section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(VI), by knowingly
causing the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such
conduct, intentionally causing damage without authorization to a protected computer. 10
70.

As noted above in paragraph 58, the Cracked Software Sites connected to the

distribution of CryptBot have led to approximately 672,220 CryptBot infections a year. Each
installation of a malicious installer package leading to the installation of CryptBot amounts to
multiple transmissions of code intended to cause damage without authorization to a protected
computer.
Wire Fraud Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants
71.

The Defendants, with intent to defraud and obtain money or property by means of

false or fraudulent pretenses, commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 by transmitting
or causing to be transmitted, by means of wire communication in interstate or foreign commerce,
writings, signs, and signals for the purpose of executing fraudulent schemes. Defendants have
violated and continue to violate the wire fraud statute.
72.

The Malware Distribution Enterprise commits wire fraud, in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 1343, each time that it tricks the owner of a device into unknowingly downloading

10

A “protected computer” includes any computer “used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or
communication.” 18 U.S.C § 1030 (e)(2).

20

and installing CryptBot malware on the owner’s device through fraud, misrepresentation, and
deception, as alleged in paragraphs 38-45.
73.

As described in paragraphs 47 and 49, the Malware Distribution Enterprise

leverages installer packages for Google Earth Pro and Google Chrome to install malware on
unsuspecting users’ machines.
74.

Google has suffered injury to its business or property as a result of these

fraudulent schemes.
Identity Fraud Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants
75.

The Defendants, in furtherance of the Malware Distribution Enterprise, commit

identity fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7) by knowingly transferring, possessing, and
using, without lawful authority, means of identification of their victims with the intent to
commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, unlawful activity in violation of state and federal
law and affecting interstate commerce.
76.

Specifically, as alleged in paragraphs 34-37, the CryptBot Defendants target and

steal, among other things, users credentials, in order to traffic in such credentials for profit.
Additionally, as alleged in paragraphs 32-42, the CryptBot Defendants’ theft of such credentials
is aided and abetted by the Malware Distribution Defendants, who help distribute the CryptBot
malware used to exfiltrate such sensitive information from victim users.

Access Device Fraud Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants

78.

The Defendants, knowingly and with intent to defraud, and in furtherance of the

Malware Distribution Enterprise, committed and continue to commit access device fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1029(a)(2)-(3), by trafficking in or using unauthorized access
devices in the form of stolen passwords, credentials, and other account information in order to
21

obtain anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during a one-year period, and/or possessing
fifteen or more unauthorized access devices, and affecting interstate or foreign commerce. As
previously mentioned, FTI estimates that the Malware Distribution Enterprise is associated with
approximately 672,220 infections annually, and each infection is likely to lead to the theft of
sensitive information.11 360installer pays $2 per installation, so with over hundreds of thousands
of infections, the affiliate payments alone are believed to be well in excess of $1,000 annually.
Those affiliate payments are only a portion of the value of the stolen information. Accordingly,
and upon information and belief, the stolen information at issue here exceeds $1,000 per year.
79.

Specifically, as alleged in paragraph 34-37, the CryptBot Defendants target and

steal “access devices” in the form of stolen credentials from Google Chrome users to traffic these
credentials for profit. Additionally, the CryptBot Defendants’ theft of such credentials is aided
and abetted by the Malware Distribution Defendants, who help distribute the CryptBot malware
used to exfiltrate such sensitive information from victim users.
