Earlier today, our products detected and successfully blocked a large number of ransomware
attacks around the world. In these attacks, data is encrypted with the extension “.WCRY” added to
the filenames.
Our analysis indicates the attack, dubbed “WannaCry”, is initiated through an SMBv2 remote code
execution in Microsoft Windows. This exploit (codenamed “EternalBlue”) has been made available
on the internet through the Shadowbrokers dump on April 14th, 2017 and patched by Microsoft on
March 14.
Unfortunately, it appears that many organizations have not yet installed the patch.

A few hours ago, Spain’s Computer Emergency Response Team CCN-CERT, posted an alert on
their site about a massive ransomware attack affecting several Spanish organizations. The alert
recommends the installation of updates in the Microsoft March 2017 Security Bulletin as a means
of stopping the spread of the attack.
The National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K. also issued an alert and confirmed infections at 16
medical institutions. We have confirmed additional infections in several additional countries,
including Russia, Ukraine, and India.
It’s important to understand that while unpatched Windows computers exposing their SMB
services can be remotely attacked with the “EternalBlue” exploit and infected by the WannaCry
ransomware, the lack of existence of this vulnerability doesn’t really prevent the ransomware
component from working. Nevertheless, the presence of this vulnerability appears to be the most
significant factor that caused the outbreak.

Analysis of the attack
Currently, we have recorded more than 45,000 attacks of the WannaCry ransomware in 74
countries around the world, mostly in Russia. It’s important to note that our visibility may be limited
and incomplete and the range of targets and victims is likely much, much higher.

The malware used in the attacks encrypts the files and also drops and executes a decryptor tool.
The request for $600 in Bitcoin is displayed along with the wallet. It’s interesting that the initial
request in this sample is for $600 USD, as the first five payments to that wallet is approximately
$300 USD. It suggests that the group is increasing the ransom demands.

The tool was designed to address users of multiple countries, with translated messages in
different languages.

Language list that the malware supports
Note that the “payment will be raised” after a specific countdown, along with another display
raising urgency to pay up, threatening that the user will completely lose their files after the set
timeout. Not all ransomware provides this timer countdown.
To make sure that the user doesn’t miss the warning, the tool changes the user’s wallpaper with
instructions on how to find the decryptor tool dropped by the malware.

Malware samples contain no reference to any specific culture or codepage other than universal
English and Latin codepage CP1252. The files contain version info stolen from random Microsoft
Windows 7 system tools:

For convenient bitcoin payments, the malware directs to a page with a QR code at btcfrog, which
links to their main bitcoin wallet 13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94. Image metadata
does not provide any additional info:

For command and control, the malware extracts and uses Tor service executable with all
necessary dependencies to access the Tor network:

The example of a “user manual” in English:
What Happened to My Computer?
Your important files are encrypted.
Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer
accessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a
way to
recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files
without our decryption service.

Can I Recover My Files?
Sure. We guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. But you have not so
enough time.
You can decrypt some of your files for free. Try now by clicking .
But if you want to decrypt all your files, you need to pay.
You only have 3 days to submit the payment. After that the price will be doubled.
Also, if you don’t pay in 7 days, you won’t be able to recover your files forever.
We will have free events for users who are so poor that they couldn’t pay in 6 months.
How Do I Pay?
Payment is accepted in Bitcoin only. For more information, click .
Please check the current price of Bitcoin and buy some bitcoins. For more information, click .
And send the correct amount to the address specified in this window.
After your payment, click . Best time to check: 9:00am – 11:00am GMT from Monday to Friday.
Once the payment is checked, you can start decrypting your files immediately.
Contact
If you need our assistance, send a message by clicking .
We strongly recommend you to not remove this software, and disable your anti-virus for a while,
until you pay and the payment gets processed. If your anti-virus gets
updated and removes this software automatically, it will not be able to recover your files even if
you pay!
It also drops batch and VBS script files, and a “readme” (contents are provided in the appendix).
Just in case the user closed out the bright red dialog box, or doesn’t understand it, the attackers
drop a text file to disk with further instruction. An example of their “readme” dropped to disk as
“@Please_Read_Me@.txt” to many directories on the victim host. Note that the English written
here is done well, with the exception of “How can I trust?”. To date, only two transactions appear
to have been made with this 115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn bitcoin address for almost
$300:

Q: What's wrong with my files?

A: Ooops, your important files are encrypted. It means you will not be able to access them
anymore until they are decrypted.
If you follow our instructions, we guarantee that you can decrypt all your files quickly and safely!
Let’s start decrypting!
Q: What do I do?
A: First, you need to pay service fees for the decryption.
Please send $300 worth of bitcoin to this bitcoin address:
115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn
Next, please find an application file named “@WanaDecryptor@.exe”. It is the decrypt software.
Run and follow the instructions! (You may need to disable your antivirus for a while.)
Q: How can I trust?
A: Don’t worry about decryption.
We will decrypt your files surely because nobody will trust us if we cheat users.
* If you need our assistance, send a message by clicking on the decryptor window.
Once started it immediately spawns several processes to change file permissions and
communicate with tor hidden c2 servers:
attrib +h .
icacls . /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q
C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Temp\taskdl.exe
@WanaDecryptor@.exe fi
300921484251324.bat
C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Temp\taskdl.exe
C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Temp\taskdl.exe
The malware checks the mutexes “Global\MsWinZonesCacheCounterMutexA” and
“Global\MsWinZonesCacheCounterMutexA0” (Update: Thanks Didier Stevens for the correction
on the extra mutex name!) to determine if a system is already infected. It also runs the command:
cmd.exe /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete &
bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set
{default} recoveryenabled no & wbadmin delete catalog -quiet

This results in an UAC popup that user may notice.

The malware use TOR hidden services for command and control. The list of .onion domains
inside is as following:
gx7ekbenv2riucmf.onion
57g7spgrzlojinas.onion
Xxlvbrloxvriy2c5.onion
76jdd2ir2embyv47.onion

sqjolphimrr7jqw6.onion

Mitigation and detection information
Quite essential in stopping these attacks is the Kaspersky System Watcher component. The
System Watcher component has the ability to rollback the changes done by ransomware in the
event that a malicious sample managed to bypass other defenses. This is extremely useful in
case a ransomware sample slips past defenses and attempts to encrypt the data on the disk.

12/15

System Watcher blocking the WannaCry attacks
Mitigation recommendations:
1. Make sure that all hosts are running and have enabled endpoint security solutions.
2. Install the official patch (MS17-010) from Microsoft, which closes the affected SMB Server
vulnerability used in this attack.
3. Ensure that Kaspersky Lab products have the System Watcher component enabled.
4. Scan all systems. After detecting the malware attack as
MEM:Trojan.Win64.EquationDrug.gen, reboot the system. Once again, make sure MS17010 patches are installed.
