Forensic analysis shows phones of those close to journalist were targeted before and after
he was murdered
In the wake of the brutal murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the NSO Group
emphatically denied that its government clients had used its hacking malware to target the
journalist or his family.
“I can tell you very clear. We had nothing to do with this horrible murder,” Shalev Hulio, the
chief executive of the Israeli surveillance firm, told the US TV news programme 60 Minutes in
March 2019. It was six months after Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was killed in
Turkey by assassins dispatched by Saudi Arabia, a client of NSO.
Now a joint investigation by the Guardian and other media, based on leaked data and
forensic analysis of phones, has uncovered new evidence that the company’s spyware was
used to try and monitor people close to Khashoggi both before and after his death.

In one case, a person in Khashoggi’s inner circle was hacked four days after his murder,
according to peer-reviewed forensic analysis of her device.

The investigation points to an apparent attempt by Saudi Arabia and its close ally the United
Arab Emirates to leverage NSO’s spy technology after Khashoggi’s death to monitor his
associates and the Turkish murder investigation, even going so far as to selectthe phone of
Istanbul’s chief prosecutor for potentialsurveillance.

What is in the data leak?
The data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to
have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group,
which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers
were selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit
journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared
access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have
worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security
Lab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses.
What does the leak indicate?
The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients
identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the
presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the
phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether
any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and
US numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals
some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with
Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers
on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the
start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds.
What did forensic analysis reveal?
Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were
successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30,
the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced.
Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful
infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of
information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of
targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages.

Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the
University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed
signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic
methods, and found them to be sound.
Which NSO clients were selecting numbers?
While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say
which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its
tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the
pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to
identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan,
Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the
United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO.
What does NSO Group say?
You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not
have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the
consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s
technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list
of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to
believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments
using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been
used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that
anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the
consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from
accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no
bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still
do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group
technologies”. Following publication, they explained that they considered a "target" to be a
phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus,
and reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent "targets" of
Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative
of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus.
What is HLR lookup data?
The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating
mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and
their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in
routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be
used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to
connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an
4/10

interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether
Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use
its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to
Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.
Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.
While the investigation mostly points to Khashoggi’s close associates being targeted in the
months after the murder, it also identified evidence suggesting that an NSO client targeted
the phone of his wife, Hanan Elatr, several months before his death, between November
2017 and April 2018.
The client appears to have used NSO’s spyware, Pegasus, which can transform a phone into
a surveillance device, with microphones and cameras activated without a user knowing.
Pegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video
A forensic examination of Elatr’s Android phone found that she was sent four text messages
that contained malicious links connected to Pegasus. The analysis indicated the targeting
came from the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally. However, the examination did not confirm
whether the device had been successfully infected.
“Jamal warned me before that this might happen,” Elatr said. “It makes me believe they are
aware of everything that happened to Jamal through me.” She added that she was
concerned his conversations with fellow dissidents might have been monitored through her
phone. “I kept my phone on the tea table [in their Virginia home] while Jamal was talking to a
Saudi guy twice a week.”
Elatr’s number was also contained in a leak of numbers that were selected by clients of NSO
as candidates for possible surveillance. Access to the leak was shared with the Guardian
and other media by Forbidden Stories, a nonprofit organisation, as part of a collaborative
investigation called the Pegasus project. Examination of phones was done by Amnesty
International’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the Pegasus project.
US intelligence agencies have already concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed
bin Salman, was responsible for ordering the murder of Khashoggi, a former Saudi
government insider whose criticism of the kingdom’s regime in the pages of the Washington
Post was seen as a threat to the Saudi heir.
A team of Saudi agents killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul during his
visit there to pick up documents he needed to get married to his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who
later became an outspoken advocate for accountability over his murder.

Forensic analysis revealed that Cengiz’s phone was first infected with Pegasus just four days
after his murder, on 6 October 2018. Her phone was also hacked on two other days in
October 2018. Further attempts to hack her phone followed in June 2019, although they did
not appear to be successful.Data analysis suggested that Saudi Arabia was behind her
hacking. Cengiz said she was not surprised she had been hacked: “I was thinking this after
the murder. But what can you do?”
A close friend of Khashoggi, Wadah Khanfar, the former director general of the Al Jazeera
television network, was also hacked using Pegasus, with analysis showing that his phone
was infected as recently July 2021.
The phone analysis discoveries and leaked phone records suggest that Saudi Arabia and its
allies used NSO’s spyware in the aftermath of the murder to monitor the campaign for justice
led by friends and associates of Khashoggi, while also showing an intent to spy on the official
Turkish inquiry into his murder.
Khashoggi associates who were targeted for possible surveillance after his death, according
to the leak, include Abdullah Khashoggi, the journalist’s son; Azzam Tamimi, a PalestinianBritish activist and friend, and Madawi Al-Rasheed, a London-based scholar who co-created
an opposition party of expatriate Saudis in the wake of the murder.

Analysis of Rasheed’s phone found evidence of an attempted hack in April 2019, but there
was no evidence the spyware was successfully installed.
Other Khashoggi-connected names linked to in the data were Yahya Assiri, a UK-based
Saudi activist who documents human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and was in close
contact with Khashoggi before his death, and Yasin Aktay, a friend of Khashoggi and a top
aide to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. No forensics were able to be carried
out on their phones.
Q&A
What is the Pegasus project?
Show
The Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its
clients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship
product is Pegasus, spying software – or spyware – that targets iPhones and Android
devices. Once a phone is infected, a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats, photos,
emails and location data, or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing.
Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty
International had access to a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected as targets
by clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16
7/10

other news organisations, including the Washington Post, Le Monde, Die Zeit and
Süddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several
months on the investigation, which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories.
In an interview, Aktay said he had already been alerted by Turkish intelligence officials that
his phone had been hacked after Khashoggi’s death because the Saudis were still trying to
create a “map” of the journalist’s connections. “It was needless,” Aktay said of the
surveillance. “I was just a friend of his.”

The phone number of İrfan Fidan, the Istanbul chief prosecutor who later formally charged 20
Saudi nationals over the killing, also appeared in the list of numbers of possible candidates
for surveillance by NSO Group clients.

Without forensic examination of their phones, it is not possible to know whether these targets
were infiltrated or successfully hacked using Pegasus.
In a statement, NSO said: “Our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous
murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We can confirm that our technology was not used to listen,
monitor, track, or collect information regarding him or his family members mentioned in your
inquiry.”
Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, which is a partner in the
Pegasus project, said new discoveries about Khashoggi-related targets indicated an attempt
by Saudi Arabia and others to gather intelligence on the fallout from the killing.
“The targeting indicates a clear intention to know what the prosecutor and a few other high
political actors were doing,” she said. “They saw Turkey as the heart of what they needed to
control.”
On Tuesday 27 July, at 8pm BST, a panel including Agnès Callamard, secretary general of
Amnesty International, will discuss the global implications of the Pegasus project. Book your
