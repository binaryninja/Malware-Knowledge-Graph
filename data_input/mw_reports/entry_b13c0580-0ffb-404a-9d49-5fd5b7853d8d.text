Investment banking firm Morgan Stanley has reported a data breach after attackers stole
personal information belonging to its customers by hacking into the Accellion FTA server of a
third-party vendor.
Morgan Stanley is a leading global financial services firm providing investment banking,
securities, wealth and investment management services worldwide.
The American multinational company's clients include corporations, governments,
institutions, and individuals in more than 41 countries.

Guidehouse, a third-party vendor that provides account maintenance services to Morgan
Stanley's StockPlan Connect business, notified the investment banking company in May
2021 that attackers hacked its Accellion FTA server to steal information belonging to Morgan
Stanley stock plan participants.
The Guidehouse server was breached by exploiting an Accellion FTA vulnerability in January
before the vendor patched it within five days of the fix becoming available.
Guidehouse discovered the breach in March and the impact to Morgan Stanley customers in
May, when it notified the financial services company of the incident and that no evidence was
found of the stolen data being disseminated online by the threat actors.
"There was no data security breach of any Morgan Stanley applications," Morgan Stanley
said in data breach notification letters sent to impacted individuals.
"The incident involves files which were in Guidehouseâ€™s possession, including encrypted files
from Morgan Stanley."
However, even though the stolen files were stored in encrypted form on the compromised
Guidehouse Accellion FTA server, the threat actors also obtained the decryption key during
the attack.
Morgan Stanley says that the documents stolen during this incident contained:
Stock plan participants' names
Addresses (last known address)
Dates of birth
Social security numbers
Corporate company names
The company added that the files stolen from Guidehouse's FTA server did not contain
passwords information or credentials that the threat actors could use to gain access to
impacted Morgan Stanley customers' financial accounts.
"The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very
seriously," a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told BleepingComputer. "We are in close contact
with Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients."

Clop gang and FIN11 behind series of Accellion hacks
While the attackers' identity was not disclosed in Morgan Stanley's data breach notification, a
joint statement published by Accellion and Mandiant from February shed more light on the
attacks, directly linking them to the FIN11 cybercrime group.

The Clop ransomware gang has also used an Accellion FTA zero-day vulnerability (disclosed
in December 2020) to steal data from multiple companies.
Accellion has said that roughly 300 customers used the 20-year-old legacy FTA software,
with less than 100 of them being breached in these attacks.
Starting in January, BleepingComputer has reported multiple data breaches impacting
companies and organizations after their Accellion FTA servers were compromised, allowing
the cybercrime groups to exfiltrate sensitive information.
So far, these threat actors have hit energy giant Shell, cybersecurity firm Qualys, the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Singtel, supermarket giant Kroger, the Office of the
Washington State Auditor ("SAO"), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission
(ASIC), and multiple universities and other organizations.
In February, Five Eyes members have also issued a joint security advisory on these attacks
and extortion attempts.
