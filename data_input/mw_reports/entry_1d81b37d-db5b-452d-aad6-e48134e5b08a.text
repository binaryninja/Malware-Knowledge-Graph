Royal Ransomware Deep Dive
kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/royal-ransomware-deep-dive

The threat actor group behind Royal ransomware first appeared in January 2022, pulling
together actors previously associated with Roy/Zeon, Conti and TrickBot malware. Originally
known as “Zeon” before renaming themselves “Royal” in September 2022, they are not
considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation because their coding/infrastructure
are private and not made available to outside actors. Since the start of 2023, they have
escalated their attacks to focus on top tier corporations for larger ransoms. Their ransoms
reportedly range from $250,000 to over $2 million. Although known for using the double
extortion method of both encrypting and exfiltrating data, as of this writing the group does not
have a data leak site where they publish the names of their victims.
Until recently, the Royal group was observed primarily targeting systems running Windows
operating system; however, reports surfaced in February 2023 of a variant able to
compromise Linux/virtual machines.

To gain initial access into a victim network, the group has seemed to favor call-back phishing
ploys, often impersonating food delivery or software providers needing subscription
renewals. After a victim calls the telephone number in the phishing email to dispute/cancel
the supposed subscription, the victim is persuaded by the threat actor to install remote
access software on their computer, thereby providing the actors with initial access to their
organization’s network.
Open and closed-source intelligence has also reported the group exploiting web
vulnerabilities to compromise networks, indicating a potentially greater level of sophistication
than the call-back scheme suggests. Another initial access method associated with the group
is the abuse of Google Ads to deliver malware: users browsing the internet click on ads they
believe to be legitimate, but ultimately lead to downloads of BatLoader, a multifaceted initial
access malware. Other tools utilized by Royal include the post exploitation framework Cobalt
Strike for persistent access along with PowerSploit, common remote access tools and
exfiltration tools such as MegaCMD and SharpExfiltrate.

Investigation

Initial Exploit

2/13

In one incident, Kroll’s review of the available evidence suggested that the Royal
ransomware actors likely gained access into the environment by purchasing their way in from
an unrelated actor; many actors are known to serve as “brokers” for such access. Kroll
determined that a renamed version of the remote access and management software
NetSupport Manager was installed during a previous incident on the victim’s network. In
Kroll’s experience investigating similar attack patterns, a phishing email most likely delivered
an .iso file for the software; however, due to the passage of time and normal rollover of logs,
no remnant of a potential phishing email existed at the time of the investigation. In Kroll’s
experience, the time between the initial installation of the remote access tool and when it
was ultimately used by Royal ransomware actors indicated that the software was not
installed by the ransomware actors, but rather they purchased the access.
MITRE ATT&CK: T1588: Obtain Capabilities

Internal Scouting
Kroll observed the Royal actors using the network scanning tool Netscan to identify network
shares and other network information. While Netscan is legitimate open-source software,
many threat actors are known to use it for reconnaissance because the tool is lightweight
and provides an extensive suite of network scanning capabilities. ADFind was also identified
as a method to enumerate domain members and groups. In addition, the threat actors used
batch scripts to ping, or identify, other systems on the network, along with common
commands such as “net user” and “net localgroup” to gain an understanding of the
environment.

Toolkit Deployment
The Royal threat actors leveraged legitimate remote access tools such as Splashtop, Atera
Agent and AnyDesk to maintain command and control (C2) within the environment. The use
of all of these tools is not uncommon, as they provide guaranteed persistence by ensuring a
number of channels are available for re-entry. The actors additionally deployed Cobalt Strike
to maintain control via an HTTPS malleable C2 configuration, commonly with recently
registered domains (Figure 2).

MITRE ATT&CK: T1573.001: Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography
To enable the deployment of the ransomware, Royal actors are known to disable antivirus
software, such as Microsoft Defender, with PowerShell commands (Figure 3) as well as tools
such as PowerTool64.exe and GMER to remove endpoint detection and response (EDR)
software. Both GMER and PowerTool64 are designed to remove rootkit type malware, but
can also be used maliciously to remove applications at the kernel level. These tools can
prevent the creation of handles, threads and processes from software such as EDR, which in
turn can prevent the detection of other malicious tools.

Escalation
Our investigators observed the threat actors leveraging the common post exploitation tool
PowerSploit, in particular via the Find-LocalAdminAccess module, in order to identify
machines where the current user has local administrator privileges (Figures 4 and 5).

Lateral Movement
Royal actors leverage the information gained from PowerSploit to navigate around the
network via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) before installing remote access tools and
disabling antivirus/EDR as they land on new devices. Cobalt Strike is also used to pass
explicit credentials to conduct activities across the network.
MITRE ATT&CK: T1021.001: Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol

Mission Execution
As Royal actors employ the double extortion strategy, one of their main aims is to identify
and exfiltrate sensitive information. The group uses a number of tools to extract files to cloud
storage stealthily via automations, including SharpExfiltrate and Megacmd.exe.
MITRE ATT&CK: T1537: Transfer Data to Cloud Account
MITRE ATT&CK: T1020: Automated Exfiltration
Once data is exfiltrated, Royal actors will then execute the ransomware binary. This is
typically undertaken by a batch script that lists computers, the unique identification key and
the percentage of file encryption to use in values between 1 and 100 (Figure 6).

MITRE ATT&CK: T1059.003: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell
MITRE ATT&CK: T1064: Scripting
The analyzed sample depicted in Figure 7 is a 32-bit Portable Executable written in C++;
Kroll’s malware analysis team was able to determine the exact date and time when this was
compiled. When run from the command line, the ransomware accepts three arguments:
-path (the path to be encrypted)
-id (a 32-character alphanumeric ID unique to the victim, which will also be appended
to the Tor URL)
-ep (percentage of the file to be encrypted. It accepts values between 1 and 100, and if
a value is given that is not in the range 1-100, the ransomware will encrypt 50%)

5/13

Figure 7 - Ransomware Configuration Detailing Command Arguments
After parsing the command line arguments, the ransomware deletes the Volume Shadow
Copies to prevent restoration (Figure 8). It achieves this by creating a new vssadmin.exe
process with the argument "delete shadows /all /quiet".

6/13

Figure 8 - Ransomware Configuration Detailing Volume Shadow Copy Deletion
The ransomware ensures that the -id parameter is 32 characters long and that the current
path does not contain certain file extensions (such as .exe, .dll or .bat) or already encrypted
files (with extension .royal). It then proceeds with the encryption routine, which uses
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It finally writes the ransom note in a file named
“README.TXT” (Figure 9). The note’s text is contained within the .rdata section of the
executable, along with the RSA public key and other strings used by the program.

If a ransom is not agreed, the actors claim they will post the victim’s exfiltrated information on
their data leak site. While no data leak site for Royal has been identified as of this writing,
similar threat actor groups often post a summary of the victim, along with a link to
view/download the collected victim data.

Recommendations

10/13

Kroll has identified recommendations relating to this alert:
Recommendation

Observation

Monitor PowerShell execution

The threat actor utilized Cobalt Strike. Monitoring
PowerShell execution can identify malicious activity
associated with Cobalt Strike.

Ensure PowerShell is logged
and create detections for
encoded script execution.
Audit user, administrator and
service accounts
Ensure accounts have the
correct access and privileges.
Implement the principle of
least privilege.
Implement multifactor
authentication

The threat actor is often able to install tools on user
endpoints. Limiting the privileges of users can prevent a
threat actor from installing malicious software.

Enabling multifactor authentication can prevent a threat
actor from moving laterally and accessing sensitive data.

Multifactor authentication can
restrict access to sensitive
areas and can prevent lateral
movement.
Review backup strategies
Ensure multiple backups are
taken and at least one backup
is isolated from the network.
Review remote access tools
Whitelist and limit the use of
multiple remote access tools
within the network.

As a ransomware actor’s main aim is to disrupt business,
ensuring a viable backup and recovery strategy is in place
can allow a business to recover quickly.

Threat actors leverage legitimate remote access tools to
maintain persistence. Ensure remote access is monitored
and that only approved remote access tools exist in the
environment.
