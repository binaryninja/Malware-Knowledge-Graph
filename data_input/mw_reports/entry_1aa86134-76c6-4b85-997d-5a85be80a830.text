Indicators of Compromise Associated with OnePercent
Group Ransomware
Summary
The FBI has learned of a cyber-criminal group who self identifies as the
“OnePercent Group” and who have used Cobalt Strike to perpetuate
ransomware attacks against US companies since November 2020. OnePercent
Group actors compromise victims through a phishing email in which an
attachment is opened by the user. The attachment’s macros infect the system
with the IcedID1 banking trojan. IcedID downloads additional software to include
Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike moves laterally in the network, primarily with
PowerShell remoting.
OnePercent Group actors encrypt the data and exfiltrate it from the victims’
systems. The actors contact the victims via telephone and email, threatening to
release the stolen data through The Onion Router (TOR) network and clearnet,
unless a ransom is paid in virtual currency. OnePercent Group actors’ extortion
tactics always begin with a warning and progress from a partial leak of data to a
full leak of all the victim’s exfiltrated data. The extortion/data leak typically
follows these steps:

IcedID can also be delivered using TA551 (also known as Shathak and GoldCabin).

• Leak Warning: After initially gaining access to a victim network, OnePercent Group actors leave a
ransom note stating the data has been encrypted and exfiltrated. The note states the victim needs
to contact the OnePercent Group actors on TOR or the victim data will be leaked. If the victim does
not make prompt communication within a week of infection, the OnePercent Group actors follow
up with emails and phone calls to the victim stating the data will be leaked.
• One Percent Leak: If the victim does not pay the ransom quickly, the OnePercent Group actors
threaten to release a portion of the stolen data to various clearnet websites.
• Full Leak: If the ransom is not paid in full after the “one percent leak”, OnePercent Group actors
threaten to sell the stolen data to the Sodinokibi Group2 to publish at an auction.
Ransom Note Details and TOR Website
OnePercent Group ransom notes are uniquely named and provide a link to the TOR website, which victims
must access by downloading and using a TOR browser. This website is used to communicate the ransom
amount, provide technical support, and negotiate with the victims via an online chat functionality. The
victims are instructed to pay the ransom to a Bitcoin address, and advised that a decryption key will be
provided in 24-48 hours after payment.

File Names and Tools used by Attackers
The following applications are leveraged by OnePercent actors to compromise victims. While some of
these applications support legitimate purposes, they can also be used by threat actors to aid in system
compromise or exploration of a victim company’s enterprise network:

Technical Details
OnePercent Group actors gain unauthorized access to victim networks through phishing emails with a
malicious zip file attachment. The zip file includes a Microsoft Word or Excel document that contains
malicious macros that allow the actors to subsequently infect the victim’s system with the banking Trojan
IcedID. The actors use IcedID to install and execute the software Cobalt Strike on the victim’s network to
move laterally to other systems within the environment through PowerShell remoting. The actors use
rclone for data exfiltration from the victim’s network. The actors have been observed within the victim’s
network for approximately one month prior to deployment of the ransomware.
Once the ransomware is successfully deployed, the victim will start to receive phone calls through spoofed
phone numbers with ransom demands and are provided a ProtonMail email address for further
communication. The actors will persistently demand to speak with a victim company’s designated
negotiator or otherwise threaten to publish the stolen data. When a victim company does not respond,
the actors send subsequent threats to publish the victim company’s stolen data via the same ProtonMail
email address.
The FBI identified the following indicators of compromise (IOCs) that we assess are likely associated with
this activity.

Back-up critical data offline.
Ensure administrators are not using “Admin Approval” mode.
Implement Microsoft LAPS, if possible.
Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage device. This
information should not be accessible from the compromised network.
Secure your back-ups and ensure data is not accessible for modification or deletion from the
system where the original data resides.
Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote
access/RDP logs.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least privilege
in mind.
Implement network segmentation.
Use multi-factor authentication with strong passphrases.
