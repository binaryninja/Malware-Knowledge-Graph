Vulnerability
0day
Zero-day
On Jan. 31, KISA (KrCERT) published an advisory about an Adobe Flash zero-day
vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) being exploited in the wild. On Feb. 1, Adobe issued an
advisory confirming the vulnerability exists in Adobe Flash Player 28.0.0.137 and
earlier versions, and that successful exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to take
control of the affected system.
FireEye began investigating the vulnerability following the release of the initial advisory from
KISA.
Threat Attribution

1/2

We assess that the actors employing this latest Flash zero-day are a suspected North
Korean group we track as TEMP.Reaper. We have observed TEMP.Reaper operators directly
interacting with their command and control infrastructure from IP addresses assigned to the
STAR-KP network in Pyongyang. The STAR-KP network is operated as a joint venture
between the North Korean Government's Post and Telecommunications Corporation and
Thailand-based Loxley Pacific. Historically, the majority of their targeting has been focused
on the South Korean government, military, and defense industrial base; however, they have
expanded to other international targets in the last year. They have taken interest in subject
matter of direct importance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) such as
Korean unification efforts and North Korean defectors.
In the past year, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has discovered newly developed wiper
malware being deployed by TEMP.Reaper, which we detect as RUHAPPY. While we have
observed other suspected North Korean threat groups such as TEMP.Hermit employ wiper
malware in disruptive attacks, we have not thus far observed TEMP.Reaper use their wiper
malware actively against any targets.
Attack Scenario
Analysis of the exploit chain is ongoing, but available information points to the Flash zeroday being distributed in a malicious document or spreadsheet with an embedded SWF file.
Upon opening and successful exploitation, a decryption key for an encrypted embedded
payload would be downloaded from compromised third party websites hosted in South
Korea. Preliminary analysis indicates that the vulnerability was likely used to distribute the
previously observed DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.
Recommendations
Adobe stated that it plans to release a fix for this issue the week of Feb. 5, 2018. Until then,
we recommended that customers use extreme caution, especially when visiting South
Korean sites, and avoid opening suspicious documents, especially Excel spreadsheets. Due
to the publication of the vulnerability prior to patch availability, it is likely that additional
criminal and nation state groups will attempt to exploit the vulnerability in the near term.
FireEye Solutions Detections
FireEye Email Security, Endpoint Security with Exploit Guard enabled, and Network Security
products will detect the malicious document natively. Email Security and Network Security
customers who have enabled the riskware feature may see additional alerts based on
suspicious content embedded in malicious documents. Customers can find more information
in our FireEye Customer Communities post.
