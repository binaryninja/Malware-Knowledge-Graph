Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Executive Summary
As the attack surface increases, defenders must focus on their most
important goal: reducing their adversaries’ operational space.
Adversaries have more tools at their disposal than ever
before. They also have a keen sense of when to use each
one for maximum effect. The explosive growth of mobile
endpoints and online traffic works in their favor. They have
more space in which to operate and more choices of
targets and approaches.
Defenders can use an array of strategies to meet the
challenges of an expanding threat landscape. They can
purchase best-of-breed solutions that work separately to
provide information and protection. And they can compete
for personnel in a market where talent is in short supply and
budgets are tight.
Stopping all attacks may not be possible. But you can
minimize both the risk and the impact of threats by
constraining your adversaries’ operational space and, thus,
their ability to compromise assets. One measure you can
take is simplifying your collection of security tools into an
interconnected and integrated security architecture.
Integrated security tools working together in an
automated architecture can streamline the process of
detecting and mitigating threats. You will then have time
to address more complex and persistent issues. Many
organizations use at least a half dozen solutions from just
as many vendors (page 53). In many cases, their security
teams can investigate only half the security alerts they
receive on a given day.
The Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report presents
research, insights, and perspectives from Cisco Security
Research. We highlight the relentless push-and-pull
dynamic between adversaries trying to gain more time
to operate and defenders working to close the windows

3

of opportunity that attackers try to exploit. We examine
data compiled by Cisco threat researchers and other
experts. Our research and insights are intended to help
organizations respond effectively to today’s rapidly evolving
and sophisticated threats.
This report is divided into the following sections:
Attacker Behavior
In this section, we examine how attackers reconnoiter
vulnerable networks and deliver malware. We explain how
tools such as email, third-party cloud applications, and
adware are weaponized. And we describe the methods
that cybercriminals employ during the installation phase
of an attack. This section also introduces our “time to
evolve” (TTE) research, which shows how adversaries keep
their tactics fresh and evade detection. We also give an
update on our efforts to reduce our average median time to
detection (TTD). In addition, we present the latest research
from Cisco on malware risk for various industries and
geographic regions.
Defender Behavior
We offer updates on vulnerabilities in this section. One
focus is on the emerging weaknesses in middleware
libraries that present opportunities for adversaries to use
the same tools across many applications, reducing the
time and cost needed to compromise users. We also share
Cisco’s research on patching trends. We note the benefit
of presenting users with a regular cadence of updates to
encourage the adoption of safer versions of common web
browsers and productivity solutions.

Executive Summary and Major Findings

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study

Industry

This section covers the results of our third Security
Capabilities Benchmark study, which focuses on security
professionals’ perceptions of the state of security in
their organizations. This year, security professionals
seem confident in the tools they have on hand, but
they are uncertain about whether these resources can
help them reduce the operational space of adversaries.
The study also shows that public security breaches are
having a measurable impact on opportunities, revenue,
and customers. At the same time, breaches are driving
technology and process improvements in organizations.
For more in-depth analysis around the state of security
in organizations, go to page 49.

In this section, we explain the importance of ensuring
value chain security. We examine the potential harm of
governments stockpiling information about zero-day
exploits and vulnerabilities in vendors’ products. In addition,
we discuss the use of rapid encryption as a solution for
protecting data in high-speed environments. Finally, we
outline the challenges of organizational security as global
Internet traffic, and the potential attack surface, grow.

4

Conclusion
In the conclusion, we suggest that defenders adapt their
security practices so they can better meet typical security
challenges along the attack chain and reduce adversaries’
operational space. This section also offers specific
guidance on establishing an integrated and simplified
approach to security: one that will connect executive
leadership, policy, protocols, and tools to prevent, detect,
and mitigate threats.

Executive Summary and Major Findings

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Major Findings
● Three leading exploit kits—Angler, Nuclear, and
Neutrino—abruptly disappeared from the landscape
in 2016, leaving room for smaller players and new
entrants to make their mark.
● According to the Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study, most companies use more than five
security vendors and more than five security products
in their environment. Fifty-five percent of the security
professionals use at least six vendors; 45 percent use
anywhere from one to five vendors; and 65 percent
use six or more products.
● The top constraints to adopting advanced security
products and solutions, according to the benchmark
study, are budget (cited by 35 percent of the
respondents), product compatibility (28 percent),
certification (25 percent), and talent (25 percent).
● The Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study found that, due to various constraints,
organizations can investigate only 56 percent of
the security alerts they receive on a given day. Half
of the investigated alerts (28 percent) are deemed
legitimate; less than half (46 percent) of legitimate
alerts are remediated. In addition, 44 percent of
security operations managers see more than 5000
security alerts per day.
● Twenty-seven percent of connected third-party cloud
applications introduced by employees into enterprise
environments in 2016 posed a high security risk.
Open authentication (OAuth) connections touch the
corporate infrastructure and can communicate freely
with corporate cloud and software-as-a-service
(SaaS) platforms after users grant access.

5

● An investigation by Cisco that included 130
organizations across verticals found that 75 percent
of those companies are affected by adware infections.
Adversaries can potentially use these infections to
facilitate other malware attacks.
● Increasingly, the operators behind malvertising
campaigns are using brokers (also referred to as
“gates”). Brokers enable them to move with greater
speed, maintain their operational space, and evade
detection. These intermediary links allow adversaries
to switch quickly from one malicious server to another
without changing the initial redirection.
● Spam accounts for nearly two-thirds (65 percent)
of total email volume, and our research suggests
that global spam volume is growing due to large and
thriving spam-sending botnets. According to Cisco
threat researchers, about 8 percent to 10 percent of
the global spam observed in 2016 could be classified
as malicious. In addition, the percentage of spam
with malicious email attachments is increasing, and
adversaries appear to be experimenting with a wide
range of file types to help their campaigns succeed.
● According to the Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study, organizations that have not yet suffered a
security breach may believe their networks are safe.
This confidence is probably misplaced, considering
that 49 percent of the security professionals surveyed
said their organizations have had to manage public
scrutiny following a security breach.

Executive Summary and Major Findings

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

● The Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study also found that nearly a quarter of the
organizations that have suffered an attack lost
business opportunities. Four in 10 said those
losses are substantial. One in five organizations lost
customers due to an attack, and nearly 30 percent
lost revenue.
● When breaches occur, operations and finance
were the functions most likely to be affected (36
percent and 30 percent, respectively), followed
by brand reputation and customer retention (both
at 26 percent), according to respondents to the
benchmark study.
● Network outages that are caused by security breaches
can often have a long-lasting impact. According to
the benchmark study, 45 percent of the outages
lasted from 1 to 8 hours; 15 percent lasted 9 to 16
hours, and 11 percent lasted 17 to 24 hours. Fortyone percent (see page 55) of these outages affected
between 11 percent and 30 percent of systems.

6

● Vulnerabilities in middleware—software that serves
as a bridge or connector between platforms or
applications—are becoming more apparent, raising
concerns that middleware is becoming a popular
threat vector. Many enterprises rely on middleware,
so the threat could affect every industry. During the
course of a Cisco® project, our threat researchers
discovered that a majority of new vulnerabilities
examined were attributable to the use of middleware.
● The cadence of software updates can affect user
behavior when it comes to installing patches and
upgrades. According to our researchers, regular and
predictable update schedules result in users upgrading
their software sooner, reducing the time during which
adversaries can take advantage of vulnerabilities.
● The 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study
found that most organizations rely on third-party
vendors for at least 20 percent of their security, and
those who rely most heavily on these resources are
most likely to expand their use in the future.

Executive Summary and Major Findings

Introduction

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Introduction
Adversaries have a vast and varied portfolio of techniques
for gaining access to organizational resources and for
attaining unconstrained time to operate. Their strategies
cover all the basics and include:
● Taking advantage of lapses in patching and updating
● Luring users into socially engineered traps
● Injecting malware into supposedly legitimate online content
such as advertising

They have many other capabilities, as well, from exploiting
middleware vulnerabilities to dropping malicious spam. And
once they’ve achieved their goals, they can quickly and
quietly shut down their operations.
Adversaries work nonstop to evolve their threats, move with
even more speed, and find ways to widen their operational
space. The explosive growth in Internet traffic—driven
largely by faster mobile speeds and the proliferation of
online devices—works in their favor by helping to expand the
attack surface. As that happens, the stakes grow higher for
enterprises. The Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study found that more than one-third of organizations that
have been subject to an attack lost 20 percent of revenue
or more. Forty-nine percent of the respondents said their
business had faced public scrutiny due to a security breach.
How many enterprises can suffer such damage to their
bottom line and remain healthy? Defenders must focus their
resources on reducing their adversaries’ operational space.
Attackers will then find it extremely difficult to gain access

to valuable enterprise resources and to conduct their
activities without being detected.
Automation is essential to achieving this goal. It helps
you understand what normal activity is in the network
environment, so you can focus scarce resources on
investigating and resolving true threats. Simplifying
security operations also helps you become more effective
at eliminating adversaries’ unconstrained operational
space. However, the benchmark study shows that most
organizations are using more than five solutions from
more than five vendors (page 53).
Such a complex web of technology, and the overwhelming
number of security alerts, is a recipe for less, not more,
protection. Adding more security talent can help, of
course. With more experts on board, the logic goes, the
better the organization’s ability to manage technology and
deliver better outcomes. However, scarce security talent
and limited security budgets make hiring sprees unlikely.
Instead, most organizations must make do with the talent
they have. They rely on outsourced talent to add muscle to
their security teams while also conserving budget.
The real answer to meeting these challenges, as we
explain later in this report, is to operationalize people,
processes, and technology in an integrated manner. To
operationalize security is to truly understand what the
enterprise needs to protect, as well as what measures
should be used to protect those vital assets.

The Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report presents our latest security industry advances designed to help
organizations and users defend against attacks. We also look at the techniques and strategies that adversaries
use to break through those defenses. The report also highlights major findings from the Cisco 2017 Security
Capabilities Benchmark Study, which examines the security posture of enterprises and their perceptions of their
preparedness to defend against attacks.

Introduction

The Expansion of the
Attack Surface

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

The Expansion of the
Attack Surface
Mobile devices. Public cloud. Cloud infrastructure. User
behavior. Security professionals who participated in Cisco’s
third annual Security Capabilities Benchmark Study cited
all those elements as top sources of concern when they
think about their organization’s risk of exposure to a cyber
attack (Figure 1). This is understandable: The proliferation
of mobile devices creates more endpoints to protect. The
cloud is expanding the security perimeter. And users are,
and always will be, a weak link in the security chain.
As businesses embrace digitization—and the Internet of
Everything (IoE)¹ begins to take shape—defenders will have
even more to worry about. The attack surface will only
expand, giving adversaries more space to operate.
For more than a decade, the Cisco® Visual Networking
Index (VNI) has provided global IP traffic forecasts and

analyzed the dynamic factors that facilitate network growth.
Consider these statistics from the most recent report,
The Zettabyte Era—Trends and Analysis:²
● Annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte (ZB)
threshold by the end of 2016 and reach 2.3 ZB per year by
2020. (A zettabyte is 1000 exabytes, or 1 billion terabytes.)
That represents a threefold increase in global IP traffic in
the next 5 years.
● Traffic from wireless and mobile devices will account for
two-thirds (66 percent) of total IP traffic by 2020. Wired
devices will account for only 34 percent.
● From 2015 to 2020, average broadband speeds will
nearly double.
● By 2020, 82 percent of all consumer Internet traffic globally
will be IP video traffic, up from 70 percent in 2015.

The Expansion of the Attack Surface

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

In addition, the Cisco VNI™ Forecast and Methodology,
2015–2020 white paper³ predicts that the volume of
global Internet traffic in 2020 will be 95 times as great as
it was in 2005.
Of course, opportunistic cybercriminals pay close
attention to these trends, too. We are already seeing
operators in the shadow economy taking steps to become
more agile in this changing environment. They are creating
highly targeted and varied attacks designed to succeed
across the expanding attack surface. Meanwhile, security
teams are in a constant firefighting mode, overwhelmed
by alerts. They’re having to rely on an array of security
products in the network environment that only add more
complexity and can even increase an organization’s
susceptibility to threats.

Organizations must:
● Integrate their security technology
● Simplify their security operations
● Rely more on automation

This approach will help reduce operational expenses, ease
the burden on security personnel, and deliver better security
outcomes. Most important, it will give defenders the ability
to focus more of their time on eliminating the unconstrained
space in which adversaries currently operate.

Web Attack Methods: “Short Tail” Threats
Help Adversaries Lay the Groundwork
for Campaigns
Reconnaissance is, of course, a foundational step for
launching a cyber attack. In this phase, adversaries look for
vulnerable Internet infrastructure or network weaknesses
that will allow them to gain access to users’ computers and,
ultimately, to infiltrate organizations.
Suspicious Windows binaries and potentially unwanted
applications (PUAs) topped the list of web attack
methods for 2016 by a significant margin (see Figure 2).
Suspicious Windows binaries deliver threats such as
spyware and adware. Malicious browser extensions are
an example of PUAs.
Facebook scams, which include fake offers and media
content along with survey scams, ranked third on our
list. The continued prominence of Facebook scams
on our annual and midyear lists of the most commonly
observed malware highlights the foundational role of social
engineering in many cyber attacks. Facebook has nearly
1.8 billion monthly active users worldwide.⁴ It is logical
territory for cybercriminals and other actors looking to dupe
users. One positive development is the company’s recent
announcement that it is taking steps to eliminate fake
news and hoaxes. Critics suggest such content may have
influenced voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.⁵

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Browser redirection malware rounded out the top five most
commonly observed malware types for 2016. As discussed
in the Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report,⁶ browser
infections can expose users to malicious advertising
(malvertising), which adversaries use to set up ransomware
and other malware campaigns. Cisco threat researchers warn
that malicious adware, which includes ad injectors, browsersettings hijackers, utilities, and downloaders, is a growing
problem. In fact, we have identified adware infections in 75
percent of the companies we recently investigated as part
of our research into the adware problem. (For more on this
topic, see “Investigation Finds 75 Percent of Organizations
Affected by Adware Infections,” page 23.)
Other malware types listed in Figure 3, such as browser
JavaScript abuse malware and browser iFrame abuse
malware, are also designed to facilitate browser
infections. Trojans (droppers and downloaders) also
appear among the top five most commonly observed
malware types, which indicates that they remain popular
tools for gaining initial access to users’ computers and
to organizational networks.
Another trend to watch: consistently high use of malware
that targets users of the Android operating platform.
Android Trojans have been moving steadily up the shorttail list over the past 2 years. They ranked among the top

10 most commonly seen types of malware in 2016. Loki
malware, which appears toward the very end of the short
tail shown in Figure 2 (see previous page), is particularly
troublesome because it can replicate and infect other files
and programs.
Figure 3 helps to illustrate malware trends that Cisco
threat researchers have observed since late 2015. It
shows that adversaries have made a definite shift in the
reconnaissance phase of web-based attacks. More threats
now specifically seek vulnerable browsers and plugins. This
shift corresponds with adversaries’ growing reliance on
malvertising, as it becomes more difficult to exploit large
numbers of users through traditional web attack vectors.
(See the next section, “Web Attack Vectors: Flash Is
Fading, but Users Must Remain Vigilant,” page 15.)
The message for individual users, security professionals,
and enterprises is clear: Making sure that browsers are
secure, and disabling or removing unnecessary browser
plugins, can go a long way toward preventing malware
infections. These infections can lead to more significant,
disruptive, and costly attacks, such as ransomware
campaigns. These simple steps can greatly reduce your
exposure to common web-based threats and prevent
adversaries from finding the operational space to carry out
the next phase of the attack chain: weaponization.

Attackers pair remote access malware with exploits in deliverable payloads.

Web Attack Vectors: Flash Is Fading, but Users Must Remain Vigilant
Adobe Flash has long been an attractive web attack
vector for adversaries who want to exploit and
compromise systems. However, as the amount of
Adobe Flash content on the web continues to decline—
and awareness about Flash vulnerabilities grows—it is
becoming more difficult for cybercriminals to exploit
users at the scale they once enjoyed.
Adobe itself is moving away from full development and
support of the software platform and has encouraged
developers to adopt newer standards such as HTML5.⁷
Providers of popular web browsers are also taking a strong
position on Flash. For example, Google announced in 2016
that it will phase out full support for Adobe Flash on its
Chrome browser.⁸ Firefox is continuing to support legacy
Flash content, but it is blocking “certain Flash content that
is not essential to the user experience.”⁹
Flash may be fading, but exploit kit developers are helping
it endure as an attack vector. However, there are signs this
may be changing. After three leading exploit kits—Angler,
Nuclear, and Neutrino—abruptly disappeared from the
threat landscape in 2016, our threat researchers observed
a significant decline in Flash-related Internet traffic. (See
“Disappearance of Major Exploit Kits Presents Opportunities
for Smaller Players and New Entrants,” page 20.) The
actors behind the Angler exploit kit heavily targeted Flash
vulnerabilities to compromise users. The Nuclear exploit kit
had a similar focus on Flash. And Neutrino relied on Flash
files to deliver exploits.

Users must remain cautious and should uninstall Flash
unless they need it for business reasons. If they must use it,
they must stay current with updates. Using web browsers
that feature automatic patching capabilities can help. As
noted in “Web Attack Methods: ‘Short Tail’ Threats Help
Adversaries Lay the Groundwork for Campaigns” on
page 13, using secure browsers—and disabling or removing
unnecessary browser plugins—will significantly reduce your
exposure to web-based threats.
Java, PDF, and Silverlight
Both Java and PDF Internet traffic experienced notable
declines in 2016. Silverlight traffic has already reached a
level that is not worthwhile for threat researchers to
track regularly.
Java, once the dominant web attack vector, has seen
its security posture improve significantly in recent years.
Oracle’s decision in early 2016 to eliminate its Java
browser plugin has helped to make Java a less attractive
web attack vector. PDF attacks are also increasingly rare.
For that reason, they can be easier to detect, which is why
many adversaries now use this strategy less often.
However, as with Flash, cybercriminals still use Java, PDF,
and Silverlight to exploit users. Individual users, enterprises,
and security professionals must be aware of these potential
roads to compromise. To reduce their risk of exposure to
these threats, they must:
● Download patches
● Use up-to-date web technology
● Avoid web content that might present risk

Application Security: Managing OAuth Connection Risk Amid an App Explosion
When enterprises shift to the cloud, their security perimeter
extends into the virtual realm. However, that security perimeter
quickly dissipates with each connected third-party cloud
application that employees introduce into the environment.
Workers want to improve their productivity and stay
connected while on the job. But these shadow IT
applications create a risk for enterprises. They touch the
corporate infrastructure and can communicate freely with the
corporate cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms
as soon as users grant access through open authentication
(OAuth). These apps can have extensive—and, at times,
excessive—access scopes. They must be managed carefully
because they can view, delete, externalize, and store
corporate data, and even act on behalf of users.
The cloud security provider CloudLock, now part of Cisco,
has been tracking the growth of connected third-party cloud
applications across a sample group of 900 organizations
representing a range of industries. As Figure 4 shows, there
were about 129,000 unique applications observed at the
beginning of 2016. By the end of October, that number had
grown to 222,000.
The number of applications has increased approximately
11 times since 2014. (See Figure 5.)
Classifying the Riskiest Applications

● Community trust rating: Peer-driven and crowd-sourced
evaluations are used for this assessment.
● Application threat intelligence: This comprehensive
background check by cybersecurity experts is based on an
application’s various security attributes, such as security
certifications, breach history, and analyst reviews.

several evaluations:
● Data-access requirements: Organizations answer the
following questions, among others: What permissions
are required to authorize the application? Does granting
data access mean that the application has programmatic
(API) access to corporate SaaS platforms through OAuth
connections? Can the application (and by extension,
the vendor) act on behalf of users and take actions with
corporate data, such as viewing and deleting?

Risk Scores and Examples
After categorizing third-party cloud applications using the CARI, CloudLock assigns a risk score for each app
on a scale of 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk).
An app that would score 1 on the scale might have, for example, minimal access scopes (it can see email only),
a 100 percent community trust rating, and no breach history.
An app that would score 5 on the scale might be one with full account access (it can see all emails,
documents, navigation history, calendar, and more), an 8 percent trust rating (meaning, only 8 percent of
administrators trust it), and no security certification.

CloudLock used the CARI to categorize the 222,000
applications it had identified across the 900 organizations
in its sample. Of those total applications, 27 percent
were deemed to be high risk, while the majority fell into
the medium-risk category. (See Figure 6.) Half of those
organizations had OAuth connections related to a
popular gaming application that was released in the
summer of 2016.

Attacker Behavior

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Cutting Through the Noise
To identify suspicious user and entity behavior in
corporate SaaS platforms, including third-party cloud
applications, security teams must sift through billions of
user activities to define normal patterns of user behavior
in their organization's environment. They must look for
anomalies that fall outside those expected patterns. Then
they need to correlate suspicious activities to determine
what might be a true threat that requires investigation.
An example of suspicious activity is excessive login activity
from several countries in a short period. Say that normal
user behavior in a certain organization is for employees to
log in to a specific application from no more than one or
two countries per week. If one user starts logging in to that
application from 68 countries over the course of one week,

a security team will want to investigate that activity
to confirm that it is legitimate.
According to our analysis, only 1 in 5000 user activities—
0.02 percent—that are associated with connected third-party
cloud applications is suspicious. The challenge for security
teams, of course, is pinpointing that one instance.
Only with automation can security teams cut through
the “noise” of security alerts and focus their resources
on investigating true threats. The multistage process
of identifying normal and potentially suspicious user
activities that is described above—and illustrated in
Figure 9—hinges on the use of automation, with
algorithms applied at every stage.

Through the malicious use of email, file attachments, websites, and other tools, attackers transmit
their cyberweapons to targets.

Flash remains an attractive web attack vector for
adversaries, but it is likely to become less so over time.
Fewer sites and browsers are supporting Flash fully or
at all, and there is generally greater awareness about
Flash vulnerabilities. (For more on this topic, see “Web

Nuclear was the first to disappear, suddenly ceasing
operation in May. Why its authors abandoned it is a
mystery. The Neutrino exploit kit, which also left the scene
in 2016, relied on Flash files to deliver vulnerabilities. (See
Figure 11 on next page for a list of top vulnerabilities in
known exploit kits in 2016.)

2016 saw dramatic changes in the exploit kit environment.
At the start of the year, Angler, Nuclear, Neutrino, and RIG
were clear leaders among exploit kits. By November, RIG was
the only one from that group still active. As Figure 10 shows,
exploit kit activity dropped off significantly around June.

A Giant Goes Silent
Angler—the most advanced and largest among known
exploit kits—also targeted Flash vulnerabilities and was
linked to several high-profile malvertising and ransomware
campaigns. However, unlike Nuclear and Neutrino’s
disappearance, Angler’s departure in 2016 is not a mystery.
In late spring, about 50 hackers and cybercriminals
were arrested in Russia; the group was linked to the
Lurk malware, a banking Trojan that specifically targeted
Russian banks.¹⁰ Cisco threat researchers identified clear
connections between Lurk and Angler, including the fact
that Lurk was being delivered largely through Angler
to victims inside Russia. Following the arrests, Angler
vanished from the exploit kit marketplace.¹¹

Now that three of the most dominant exploit kits have
cleared the field, smaller players and new entrants can
expand their market share. And they are becoming more
sophisticated and agile. Exploit kits that appeared poised
for growth in late 2016 were Sundown, Sweet Orange,
and Magnitude. These kits, as well as RIG, are known to
target Flash, Silverlight, and Microsoft Internet Explorer
vulnerabilities. (See Figure 11.) Uninstalling Flash, and
disabling or removing unnecessary browser plugins, will
help users reduce the risk that they will be compromised
by these threats.

Attacker Behavior

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Malvertising: Adversaries Use Brokers to Increase Speed and Agility
Users are directed to exploit kits in two primary ways:
compromised websites and malvertising. Adversaries
will place a link to an exploit kit landing page into a
malicious ad or a compromised website, or they will
use an intermediate link, known as a broker. (These
links, positioned between compromised websites and
exploit kit servers, are also referred to as “gates.”)
The broker serves as an intermediary between the
initial redirection and the actual exploit kit that delivers
the malware payload to users.
The latter tactic is becoming more popular as attackers
find they must move faster to maintain their operational
space and evade detection. Brokers allow adversaries
to switch quickly from one malicious server to another
without changing the initial redirection. Because they
don’t need to constantly modify websites or malicious
ads to start the infection chain, exploit kit operators
can carry out longer campaigns.
ShadowGate: A Cost-Effective Campaign
As it becomes more difficult to compromise large
numbers of users through traditional web attack
vectors alone (see page 15), adversaries are
relying more on malvertising to expose users to
exploit kits. Our threat researchers dubbed a recent
global malvertising campaign “ShadowGate.” This
campaign illustrates how malicious ads are providing
adversaries with more flexibility and opportunity to
target users across geographic regions at scale.
ShadowGate involved websites ranging from popular
culture to retail to pornography to news. It potentially

22

affected millions of users in North America, Europe,
Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. The campaign’s
global reach and use of many languages are noteworthy.
ShadowGate, which used domain shadowing, was
first seen in early 2015. It would go quiet at times
and then randomly start up again to direct traffic to
exploit kit landing pages. Initially, ShadowGate was
used to direct users to the Angler exploit kit only.
But after Angler disappeared in the summer of 2016,
users were directed to the Neutrino exploit kit, until
that vanished as well a few months later. (For more
on this story, see “Disappearance of Major Exploit Kits
Presents Opportunities for Smaller Players and New
Entrants,” on page 20.)
Even though ShadowGate saw a high volume of web
traffic, only a tiny fraction of interactions led to a user
being directed to an exploit kit. The malicious ads
were mostly impressions—ads that render on the page
and require no user interaction. This online advertising
model allowed the actors responsible for ShadowGate
to operate their campaign more cost-effectively.
Our research into ShadowGate led to a joint effort with
a major web hosting company. We worked together to
mitigate the threat by reclaiming registrant accounts
that adversaries had used to host the activity. We then
took down all applicable subdomains.
For more details on the ShadowGate campaign,
see the September 2016 Cisco Talos blog post,
Talos ShadowGate Take Down: Global Malvertising
Campaign Thwarted.

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Investigation Finds 75 Percent of Organizations Affected by Adware Infections
Adware, when used for legitimate purposes, is software
that downloads or displays advertising through redirections,
pop-ups, and ad injections and generates revenue for its
creators. However, cybercriminals are also using adware
as a tool to help increase their revenue stream. They
use malicious adware not only to profit from injecting
advertising, but also as a first step to facilitate other
malware campaigns, such as DNSChanger malware.
Malicious adware is delivered through software bundles;
publishers create one installer with a legitimate application
along with dozens of malicious adware applications.
Bad actors use adware to:
● Inject advertising, which may lead to further infections or
exposure to exploit kits
● Change browser and operating system settings to
weaken security

We categorized the adware into four groups, based on the
primary behavior of each component:
● Ad injectors: This adware usually resides in the browser and
can affect all operating systems.
● Browser-settings hijackers: This adware component can
change computer settings to make the browser less secure.
● Utilities: This is a large and growing category of adware.
Utilities are web applications that offer a useful service to
users, such as PC optimization. These applications can inject
advertising, but their primary purpose is to convince users
to pay for the service. However, in many cases, utilities are
nothing more than scams and provide no benefits to users.
● Downloaders: This adware can deliver other software,
such as a toolbar.

We determined that 75 percent of the organizations in our
study were affected by adware infections.

● Break antivirus or other security products
● Gain full control of the host, so they can install other
malicious software
● Track users by location, identity, services used, and sites
commonly visited

and infrastructure information (for example, a company’s

To assess the scope of the adware problem for enterprises,
Cisco threat researchers examined 80 different adware
variants. About 130 organizations across verticals were
included in our investigation, which took place from
November 2015 to November 2016.

Figure 13 shows the types of incidents we observed
in the organizations included in our investigation. Ad
injectors were the primary source of infections. This
finding indicates that most of these unwanted applications
target web browsers. We have also seen an increase
in browser-based infections during the last few years,
which suggests adversaries are finding success with this
strategy for compromising users.

All the adware components we identified during our
investigation can place users and organizations at risk
for malicious activity. Security teams must recognize the
threat that adware infections pose and make sure that
users in the organization are fully aware of the risks.

Global Spam Is Increasing—and So Is the Percentage of Malicious Attachments
Cisco threat researchers conducted two studies in 2016
using opt-in customer telemetry to estimate what percentage
of total email volume is spam. We found that spam accounts
for nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of total email volume. Our
research also suggests that global spam volume is growing,
due primarily to large and thriving spam-sending botnets like
Necurs. In addition, we determined through our analysis that

about 8 percent to 10 percent of global spam observed in
2016 could be categorized as malicious.
From August to October 2016, there was a significant
increase in the number of IP connection blocks (Figure 14).¹²
This trend can be attributed to an overall rise in spam volume,
as well as reputation systems adapting to information about
spam senders.

The five-year graph from the Composite Blocking List
(CBL), a DNS-based “blackhole list” of suspected spamsending computer infections,¹³ also shows a dramatic
increase in total spam volume during 2016 (Figure 15).

volume observed in 2016. This graph shows the overall
size of the SpamCop Block List (SCBL) from November
2015 to November 2016. Each row in the SCBL
represents a distinct IP address.

A review of 10-year data from CBL (not shown) suggests
that 2016 spam volume is close to the record-high levels
seen in 2010. New antispam technologies, and high-profile
takedowns of spam-related botnets, have helped to keep
spam levels low in recent years. Our threat researchers
attribute the recent increase in global spam volume to
the Necurs botnet. Necurs is a primary vector for Locky
ransomware. It also distributes threats such as the Dridex
banking Trojan.

Between November 2105 and February 2016, SCBL size
hovered below 200,000 IP addresses. In September and
October, SCBL size exceeded 400,000 IP addresses before
dropping off in October, which our threat researchers
attribute to the operators of Necurs simply taking time off.
Also note the significant decline in June. At the end of May,
there were arrests in Russia related to the Lurk banking
Trojan (see page 21). Subsequently, several high-profile
threats, including Necurs, went silent. However, 3 weeks
later, Necurs was back in action, adding more than 200,000
IP addresses to the SCBL in less than 2 hours.

Attacker Behavior

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Many of the host IPs sending Necurs spam have been
infected for more than 2 years. To help keep the full scope
of the botnet hidden, Necurs will send spam only from a
subset of infected hosts. An infected host might be used
for 2 to 3 days, and then sometimes not again for 2 to
3 weeks. This behavior complicates the job of security
personnel who respond to spam attacks. They may believe
they have found and successfully cleaned an infected host,
but the actors behind Necurs are just biding their time until
they launch another attack.

Patterns with .wsf files during 2016 (see Figure 17) provide
an example of how adversaries will evolve malicious
spam tactics over time. This file type was rarely used as
a malicious attachment before February 2016. Then, the
use of this file type begins to grow as the Necurs botnet
becomes more active. By July, .wsf files accounted for
22 percent of all malicious spam attachments. This was
also around the time that global spam activity increased
dramatically (see previous section), an uptick that was due
largely to the Necurs botnet.

Seventy-five percent of total spam observed in October
2016 contained malicious attachments. Most of that spam
was sent by the Necurs botnet. (See Figure 17.) Necurs
sends malicious .zip attachments that include embedded
executable files such as JavaScript, .hta, .wsf, and VBScript
downloaders. In calculating the percentage of total spam
containing malicious attachments, we count both the
“container” file (.zip) and the “child” files within it (such as
a JavaScript file) as individual malicious attachments.

Through August, September, and October, we saw
fluctuations in the percentages of .wsf files. This indicates
that adversaries were pulling back at times when the file
type was being detected more frequently.

Malicious Attachments

Attackers Experiment with Attachment Types to Keep

The specific percentages for the different file types
in a given month are derived using the percentage of
total spam that contained malicious attachments seen
in that month. So, for example, in July 2016, .docm
files represented 8 percent of the total percentage of
malicious attachments observed.

continually evolving their strategies, experimenting with a
wide range of file types, and quickly switching tactics when
they don’t find success.

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Hailstorms and Snowshoes
Two types of malicious spam attacks are especially
problematic for defenders: hailstorm attacks and snowshoe
attacks. Both employ the elements of speed and targeting,
and both are highly effective.
Hailstorm attacks target antispam systems. The operators
behind these attacks take advantage of the very small
window of time between the moment they launch their
spam campaign and when antispam systems see it and
push coverage out to antispam scanners. Adversaries
typically have only seconds or minutes to operate before
their campaigns are detected and blocked.

Contrast the hailstorm attack to a snowshoe spam
campaign, also shown in Figure 18, where attackers
attempt to fly under the radar of volume-based detection
solutions. The number of DNS lookups is steady, but there
are only about 25 queries per hour. These low-volume
attacks allow adversaries to quietly distribute spam from a
large swath of IP addresses.
Even though these spam attacks operate differently, they
do have things in common. Through either approach,
adversaries can:
● Evade a bad reputation by sending from clean IPs
and domains
● Emulate marketing mail with professional content and
subscription management

The spike in Figure 18 is a hailstorm attack. The activity
is shown in the Cisco Investigate interface. Just before
the attack, no one was resolving the IP address. Then,
suddenly, the number of computers resolving the domain
in DNS spiked to more than 78,000 before dropping back
down to zero.

● Use well-configured email systems rather than sloppy scripts
or spam bots
● Properly set up forward-confirmed reverse DNS and Send
Policy Framework (SPF) records

Adversaries can also impair content detection by mutating
text and cycling through file types. (For more details on
how cybercriminals evolve their threats to evade defenders,
see the “Time to Evolve” section on page 34.) For more
information on how they experiment with malicious file
attachments for spam, see the previous section.

Once the threat is in position, it installs a back door on a target’s system, providing adversaries with
persistent access.

Web Attack Methods: “Long Tail”
Snapshot Reveals Threats That Users
Can Easily Avoid
The so-called long tail of the web attack methods spectrum
(Figure 20) includes a collection of lower-volume malware
types that are employed at a later stage in the attack
chain: installation. In this phase, the threat that has been
delivered—a banking Trojan, a virus, a downloader, or some
other exploit—installs a back door in the target system,
providing adversaries with persistent access and the
opportunity to exfiltrate data, launch ransomware attacks,
and engage in other mischief.
The threats listed in Figure 20 are samples of malware
signatures found outside the top 50 most commonly
observed malware types. The long tail of web attack
methods is, essentially, a snapshot of threats that are
quietly at work on a machine or system after a successful
attack. Many of these infections were first spawned by an
encounter with malicious adware or exposure to a wellcrafted phishing scam. These are situations that users can
often easily avoid or quickly remediate.

Vertical Risk of Malware Encounters: Attackers See Value Across the Board
In the Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report, a key
message about the risk of malware was that “no vertical is
safe.” Judging from our researchers’ periodic examination
of attack traffic (“block rates”) and “normal” or expected
traffic by industry, this message held true in the latter half
of the year.

In looking at verticals and their block rates over time
(Figure 21), we see that, at some point over the course of
several months, every industry has been subject to attack
traffic and at varying levels. It’s clear that as attacks rise
and fall, they affect different verticals at different times—
but none are spared.

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Regional Overview of Web Block Activity
Adversaries frequently shift their base of operation,
searching for weak infrastructure from which they can
launch their campaigns. By examining overall Internet traffic
volume and block activity, Cisco threat researchers can offer
insight on where malware is originating.
As Figure 22 shows, traffic from the United States
edged up slightly from the block rates seen in the Cisco
2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report. The United States

houses the far greater share of blocks, but this should be
considered a function of the country’s far greater share of
online traffic. In addition, the United States is one of the
world’s largest targets of malware attacks.
The takeaway for security professionals: Much like the
vertical web block activity, the regional web block activity
shows that malware traffic is a global problem.

2016

Figure 23 also shows that the median TTD was about 15
hours by the end of April 2016, which is greater than the
13-hour figure we reported in the Cisco 2016 Midyear
Cybersecurity Report.¹⁴ That 15-hour figure is based on data
collected from November 2015 through April 2016. It was
not derived using our modified approach to analyzing more
detailed retrospective information about files. Using the new
midyear TTD figure, we can report that TTD declined to about
9 hours for the period from May through October 2016.

Figure 23 Median TTD by Month

Dec

The median TTD fluctuated throughout 2016 but trended
downward overall. Increases in the median TTD indicate
times when adversaries launched a wave of new threats.
The subsequent decreases reflect periods where
defenders gained the upper hand and could identify
known threats quickly.

Adversaries will evolve certain malware families to avoid
detection and increase their time to operate. This tactic
hinders defenders’ progress in gaining, and then maintaining,
an edge in detecting many types of known threats. (For more
on this topic, see “Time to Evolve: For Some Threats, Change
Is Constant,” page 34). However, the fact that cybercriminals
are evolving their threats frequently and rapidly indicates that
they are facing intense and constant pressure to find ways to
keep their threats operating and profitable.

2015 Nov

This new insight helped us to determine that our median TTD
was 39 hours in November 2015. (See Figure 23.) By January
2016, we had reduced the median TTD to 6.9 hours. After
collecting and analyzing data for October 2016, our threat
researchers determined that Cisco products had achieved a
median TTD of 14 hours for the period from November 2015
to October 2016. (Note: The median TTD figure for 2016 is
the average of the medians for the period observed.)

Reviewing retrospective data is important not only for
determining a more accurate measure of our median
TTD, but also for studying how threats evolve over time.
Numerous threats in the landscape are particularly evasive
and can take a long time to identify even though they are
known to the security community.

Median Hours

Cisco is continually refining our approach to measuring
TTD so that we can ensure we are tracking and reporting
the most accurate estimate of our median TTD. Recent
adjustments to our approach have increased our visibility into
files that were categorized as “unknown” when first seen
and then later identified as “known bad” after continuous
analysis and global observation. With a more holistic view
of data, we are better able to pinpoint when a threat first
emerged and exactly how long it took for security teams to
determine that it was a threat.

Source: Cisco Security Research

Cisco defines “time to detection,” or TTD, as the window of time between a compromise and the detection of
a threat. We determine this time window using opt-in security telemetry gathered from Cisco security products
deployed around the globe. Using our global visibility and a continuous analytics model, we are able to measure
from the moment malicious code runs on an endpoint to the time it is determined to be a threat for all malicious
code that was unclassified at the time of encounter.

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Time to Evolve: For Some Threats, Change Is Constant
Cybercriminals use various obfuscation techniques to
keep their malware strong and profitable. Two common
methods they employ are evolving their payload delivery
types and quickly generating new files (defeating hash-only
detection methods). Our researchers closely examined
how adversaries have used these two strategies to help six
well-known malware families—Locky, Cerber, Nemucod,
Adwind RAT, Kryptik, and Dridex—evade detection and
continue compromising users and systems.
Through our analysis, we sought to measure the “time to
evolve” (TTE): the time it takes adversaries to change the
way specific malware is delivered and the length of time
between each change in tactics. We analyzed web attack
data from different Cisco sources—specifically, web proxy
data, cloud and endpoint advanced malware products, and
composite antimalware engines.
Our researchers looked for changes in file extensions
delivering the malware and the file content (or MIME)
type as defined by a user’s system. We determined that
each malware family has a unique pattern of evolution.
For each family, we examined the patterns in both web
and email delivery methods. We also tracked the ages of
unique hashes associated with each malware family to
determine how quickly adversaries are creating new files
(and thus, new hashes).

34

Through our research, we learned that:
● Ransomware families appear to have a similar rotation of new
binaries. However, Locky uses more file extension and MIME
combinations to deliver its payload.
● Some malware families employ only a handful of file delivery
methods. Others use 10 or more. Adversaries tend to use
effective binaries over long periods. In other cases, files pop
up and then drop off quickly, indicating that the malware
authors are under pressure to switch tactics.
● The Adwind RAT and Kryptik malware families have a higher
median TTD. (For more on TTD, see page 33.) We also see
a greater mix of file ages for these families. This suggests
that adversaries reuse effective binaries that they know are
difficult to detect.
● Looking at the file ages for the Dridex malware family, it
appears that the shadow economy may be abandoning use
of this once-popular banking Trojan. In late 2016, detection
volume for Dridex declined, as did the development of new
binaries to deliver this malware. This trend suggests that
the malware’s authors no longer see value in evolving this
threat—or that they have found a new way to package the
malware that has made it harder to detect.

Attacker Behavior

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

TTE and TTD
The six malware families we analyzed in our TTE study are
listed in Figure 24. The chart depicts the median TTD for
the top 20 malware families (by detection count) that our
researchers observed from November 2015 to November
2016. Our average median TTD for that period was about 14
hours. (For details on how we calculate TTD, see page 33.)
Many of the malware families that Cisco products are
detecting within the median TTD are industrialized threats
that spread quickly and are therefore more prevalent.
Cerber and Locky, which are both types of ransomware,
are examples.

Old and pervasive threats that adversaries don’t bother to
evolve much, or at all, are also typically detected below the
median TTD. Examples include malware families like Bayrob
(botnet malware), Mydoom (a computer worm that affects
Microsoft Windows), and Dridex (the banking Trojan).
In the following sections, we present research highlights
on TTE and TTD for the Locky, Nemucod, Adwind RAT, and
Kryptik malware families. Detailed findings for Cerber and
Dridex are included in the Appendix on page 78.

TTE Analysis: Locky
Through our TTE research, we learned that Locky and
Cerber employ a limited number of file extension and MIME
combinations to deliver malware through the web or by
email. (See Figure 25.) We observed several combinations
that included file content types related to Microsoft Word
(msdownload, ms-word). However, the associated file
extensions (.exe and .cgi) did not point back to a Word
file. We also identified content types that pointed to
malicious .zip files.

The top half of the chart depicts the ages of files that were
observed during a specific month. The bottom portion of
the chart shows monthly changes in the volume of Lockyrelated hashes, both new and previously observed files.

Both Locky and Cerber also appear to use new binaries
frequently as an attempt to evade file-based detection. File
ages for the Locky malware family are shown in Figure 26.

In Figure 26, also note the decline in volume in June as well
as the distribution of file ages. The Necurs botnet, which
was known to deliver Locky, was taken down in June. This
likely sidelined the malware authors’ efforts to keep the
malware fresh during that month. However, it’s clear that
they recovered quickly. By July, the malware had returned
to its more standard mix of file ages with the majority (74
percent) being less than a day old when first detected.

The rapid cycling of binaries for this ransomware is not
surprising. Instances of Locky and Cerber are often
detected either on the same day they are introduced or
within 1 to 2 days after, making it imperative for adversaries
to evolve these threats continually if they want them to
remain active and effective. (Figure 24, discussed earlier,
shows that Cisco products detected both Locky and Cerber
ransomware within the median TTD in 2016.)

Adversaries use this downloader malware to distribute
ransomware and other threats, such as backdoor Trojans that
facilitate click fraud. Some variants of Nemucod also serve as
engines for delivering the Nemucod malware payload.

Figure 28 File Extension and MIME Combinations for
Nemucod (Web and Email Vectors)

One reason Nemucod malware was so prevalent in 2016,
according to our threat researchers, is that its authors
frequently evolved this threat. Cisco identified more than 15
file extension and MIME combinations associated with the
Nemucod family that were used to deliver malware through
the web. Many more combinations were used to deliver the
threat to users through email (Figure 28).
Several file extension and MIME combinations (web and
email) were designed to point users to malicious .zip files
or archives. Adversaries also reused many combinations
during the months we observed.
As Figure 29 shows, many Nemucod hashes are less
than 2 days old when they are detected. In September
and October 2016, almost every binary related to the
Nemucod family that was blocked was less than a day old.

Adwind RAT used a wide range of hash ages throughout
most of the period observed in 2016, except during
September and October, when most files seen were
1 to 2 days old (Figure 32).

We also found that the median TTD for Adwind RAT
is consistently higher than the median TTD for other
malware families we analyzed (Figure 33). The malware’s
authors have apparently developed hard-to-detect
delivery mechanisms that keep Adwind RAT successful.
Therefore, they don’t need to rotate through new hashes
as frequently or as rapidly as the actors behind other
malware families do. The Adwind Trojan is also known by
other names, such as JSocket and AlienSpy.

Cisco threat researchers found that Adwind RAT (remote
access Trojan) malware is delivered through file extension
and MIME combinations that include .zip or .jar files. This
is true whether the malware is being delivered through the

Kryptik, like Adwind RAT malware, had a median TTD that
was consistently higher (about 20 hours) than other malware
families Cisco analyzed for the TTE study from November
2015 through October 2016 (Figure 36). However, by
October, Cisco products had reduced the median TTD
window for Kryptik malware to less than 9 hours (Figure 36).
The Kryptik malware family also used a wider range of
hash ages than the other malware families we analyzed,
particularly during the first half of 2016. The ability of
Kryptik’s authors to rely on older hashes for so long indicates
that defenders had trouble detecting this malware type.
During the period that we observed, Kryptik’s authors
employed a wide range of payload delivery methods through
the web attack vector. The authors used JavaScript files
and archive files such as .zip files in file extension and MIME
combinations for both web and email. (See Figure 34.)
Some of the combinations date back to 2011.

In our analysis of the six malware families, we find that
adversaries must shift tactics frequently to take advantage
of the small window of time during which their threats
can operate successfully. These adjustments indicate that
defenders are getting better at detecting known malware
quickly, even after a threat has evolved. Attackers are under
pressure to find new ways to avoid detection and keep their
campaigns profitable.

Vulnerabilities on the Decline in 2016
In the second half of 2016, vendor-disclosed vulnerabilities
dropped significantly from 2015, according to our research
(Figure 37). The National Vulnerability Database shows
a similar decline. The reasons for the drop in disclosed
vulnerability advisories are not entirely clear.

paying off. That is, vendors are now focusing on identifying
vulnerabilities and correcting them before products reach
the market.
In 2016, Apple was the vendor showing the most dramatic
decline in vulnerabilities: The company reported 705
vulnerabilities in 2015, and 324 vulnerabilities in 2016 (a 54
percent decline). Similarly, Cisco reported 488 vulnerabilities
in 2015, and 310 in 2016 (a 36 percent decline).

It should be noted that 2015 was an unusually active year
for vulnerabilities, so the 2016 numbers may reflect a
normal pace of vulnerability advisories. From January to
October 2015, total alerts reached 7602. During the same
time period in 2016, total alerts reached 6380; during this
period in 2014, total alerts were 6272.

A concern among security researchers is that “vulnerability
fatigue” may be setting in among security professionals.
In recent months, there has not been a major vulnerability
announcement that sent shock waves through the industry,
as Heartbleed did in 2014. In fact, the hype around
“named” vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed and the
increase in 2015 likely contributed to the level of fatigue—
or, at least, to less interest in reporting vulnerabilities.

The high number of vulnerability reports in 2015 may
indicate that vendors were looking more closely at existing
products and code, more carefully implementing secure
development lifecycle (SDL) practices, and identifying
vulnerabilities and subsequently fixing them. The decline in
reported vulnerabilities may indicate that these efforts are

Cisco is now using severity/impact ratings (SIRs), in which the rating levels are “critical,” “high,” “medium,” and “low.” The ratings reflect a simplified
prioritization of scores from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In addition, Cisco has adopted CVSS v3.0, the successor to CVSS v2.0.
Because of this change, some vulnerabilities may have higher scores than before, so security professionals may see a small increase in vulnerabilities that
are rated “critical” and “high,” instead of “medium” and “low.” For more information about this scoring change, read the Cisco Security blog post,
The Evolution of Scoring Security Vulnerabilities: The Sequel.

In the Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study
(page 49), security professionals indicated a slight decrease
in their agreement about security operationalization. This
decrease may be connected to “fatigue” about the need to
continually implement upgrades and patches. For example,
in 2016, 53 percent of security professionals said they
strongly agreed that they review and improve security
practices regularly, formally, and strategically; in 2014 and
2015, 56 percent strongly agreed.
Of course, a decline in vulnerabilities should not lead to
overconfidence about the threat landscape: No one should
adopt the mindset that attention to threats can lapse, even
in the absence of high-profile vulnerabilities.
As we’ve advised in past reports, security professionals
should make a concerted effort to prioritize patches. If a
lack of staffing and other resources prevents the timely
installation of all available patches, evaluate which ones are
most critical to network safety, and place those at the top
of the to-do list.

Middleware: Adversaries See Opportunity
in Unpatched Software

Server and Client Vulnerabilities
As discussed in the Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity
Report, adversaries are finding space and time to
operate within server-side solutions. By launching
attacks within server software, they can potentially gain
control of more network resources, or move laterally
among other critical solutions.

In the Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report, we
shared data about attacks against server-side systems.
In 2017, middleware, which connects platforms or
applications, is poised to attract attackers seeking
places to operate where defenders are slow to react
or recognize a threat.

Cisco researchers have tracked client and server
vulnerabilities by vendor (Figure 40).

Cisco researchers, while looking for vulnerabilities in
third-party software, discovered an average of 14 new
vulnerabilities in software per month. Most of those
vulnerabilities (62) were attributable to the use of middleware.
Of those 62 vulnerabilities, 20 were found within code that
handles PDFs; 12 were found in code that handles images;
10 were found in code for common office productivity
solutions; nine were found in code for compression; and
11 were found in other libraries (Figure 41).

Vulnerabilities in middleware pose a unique security threat
because their libraries are not usually updated as rapidly
as software that is more client-facing—that is, software that
users interact with directly on a day-to-day basis, such as
productivity solutions. Middleware libraries may be left out
of software audits, so vulnerabilities remain in place.

Defender Behavior

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Organizations may gamble on middleware being safe
and may place greater attention on updating high-profile
solutions. But they can lose the bet that adversaries
won’t seek entry to networks through these low-profile
pathways. Middleware thus becomes a security blind spot
for defenders and an opportunity for attackers.
The challenge of updating middleware libraries closely relates
to the open-source software problem (discussed in the Cisco
2015 Midyear Security Report), since many middleware
solutions come from open-source developers. (However, the
problem at hand can affect both open-source and proprietary
middleware developers.) Therefore, middleware libraries may
rely on many developers to keep them updated. On the list of
tasks that an overtaxed IT or security team needs to manage,
middleware library updates may not be a top priority, but they
should be given greater attention.
What is the potential impact of a middleware vulnerability
that is exploited by adversaries? Given the connections
between middleware and other crucial systems, such as
email or messaging, an attacker could move laterally into
these systems and send phishing messages or spam. Or
attackers could masquerade as authorized users and abuse
trust relationships between users to gain further access.
To avoid becoming the victim of an attack launched through
a middleware vulnerability, you should:
● Actively maintain a list of known dependencies and libraries
in the applications you use
● Actively monitor the security of these applications, and
mitigate risks as much as possible
● Insert a service-level agreement in contracts with software
vendors for providing patches in a timely manner
● Routinely audit and review software dependencies and
library use
● Ask software vendors for details on how they maintain and
test their products

In short: Delays in patching increase the operational space
for attackers and allow them more time to gain control of
critical systems. In the next section, we discuss this impact
and trends in the patching of common productivity solutions
such as web browsers.

Time to Patch: Closing the Recovery
Time Frame
Many users do not download and install patches in a
timely manner. Adversaries can use these unpatched
vulnerabilities to gain entry to networks. In our latest
research, we find that the key to encouraging users to
download and install patches may rest in the cadence of
software updates from vendors.
A security patch release is a clear indication to attackers
that there is a vulnerability worth exploiting. Although
sophisticated attackers have likely been exploiting the
vulnerabilities for some time, the notification of a patch tells
many others that it’s open season on the earlier versions.
When software vendors release new versions on a regular
schedule, users become conditioned to downloading
and installing updates. Conversely, when vendor upgrade
releases are erratic, users are less likely to install them.
They will continue to operate outdated solutions that may
contain exploitable vulnerabilities.
Other behaviors that affect the upgrade cycle include:
● How disruptive the reminder experience is
● How easy it is to opt out
● How often the software is used

There are varying windows of time in which users are likely
to install an upgrade when it is released by the vendor. Our
researchers looked at the installations of software on the
endpoints used by our customers. Their software fell into
three categories:
● New versions: The endpoint ran the newest available version
of the software
● Recent versions: The endpoint ran one of the previous three
versions of the software, but not the newest
● Old versions: The endpoint ran software that was more than
three versions behind the current release

As an example, if a software vendor released version 28
on January 1, 2017, version 28 would be new; version 26
would be recent; and version 23 would be old. (The figures
on the next page contain callouts of the weekly time periods
where one or more versions of the software were released.)

Defender Behavior

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

In examining users of Adobe Flash (Figure 42), we found
that, within the first week of an update release, nearly
80 percent of users install the software’s latest version.
In other words, it takes only about one week for the user
population to get up to speed with the latest version. This
one-week “recovery” period represents hackers’ window
of opportunity.

In examining upgrades for the Google Chrome web
browser, we see a different pattern. It reflects a regular
cadence of upgrades, as well as a strong opt-out policy that
makes it difficult for users to ignore update notifications. As
seen in Figure 42, endpoints running the newest version
stay relatively steady over the course of many weeks.
The Chrome data shows that users recover relatively
quickly. In the case of regular updates, one week is roughly
the recovery timeline. In one span of 9 weeks running
through Q2 and Q3 of 2016, however, there were seven
updates. During this time the population recovered, but
upgrade fatigue began to set in. The percentage of users
staying with an older version steadily climbs despite the
majority of the population recovering.

In looking at late Q4 2015 in the Adobe Flash graphic, we
see a sharp drop in the number of users on the newest
version of the solution. In the time period we examined,
Adobe released five versions of Flash in quick succession,
representing a mix of functionality additions, bug fixes, and
security updates. Such a flurry of updates may confuse
users. They may question whether they need to download
so many updates; they can become fatigued by the number
of upgrade notifications; and they may think they’ve
already downloaded a crucial update and can ignore new
notifications. No matter what drives their lack of interest in
installing an update, it’s bad news for defenders.

Mozilla’s Firefox browser also offers updates on a regular
schedule, but the recovery period after an update is released
appears to take as long as a month. That is, users do not
download and install updates as frequently as Chrome
users do. One reason may be that some users might not
use the browser regularly and therefore aren’t seeing and
downloading updates. (See Figure 43 on next page.)

We found that Firefox updated its versions about every other
week, with the frequency of updates increasing over the
course of the observation period. This increase in frequency
is reflected in the growth of old Firefox versions within the
population. The recovery time is roughly 1.5 weeks, but the
times overlap. The population that tries to stay current drops
to as little as 30 percent of the user base. At some point,
two-thirds of the users have resorted to simply running the
browser more than four versions behind the most current
one. So, although Firefox is rapidly addressing issues and
fixing bugs, the user base is not updating and restarting on
the same frequency.

for users to install upgrades after a release. At one point,
there were two releases within 5 weeks, which affected the
user population for more than 3 months, as can be seen
between Q4 of 2015 and Q1 of 2016.
Microsoft announced the end of life of Silverlight in 2012,
although patches and bug fixes are still being released.
However, it poses the same problem that Internet Explorer
does: Outdated and unpatched software invites attackers
to easily exploit it.
The recovery period for Java users shows that most are
running versions of the software that are one to three
versions behind the most recent release. The time to
recovery is about 3 weeks. An unusual pattern with Java
is that the dominant populations are those that use recent
versions. The Java update cycle is from 1 to 2 months.

For software, the level of use seems to also be an indicator
of its vulnerability. When users do not access software
often and therefore aren’t aware of the need to patch and
upgrade it, the ignored software provides space and time
for attackers to operate.

The overall lesson from time-to-patch cycles is that
upgrade release patterns are a contributing factor in user
security posture, which can place networks at risk.

We can see this in the research on Microsoft Silverlight,
which shows a recovery period of as long as 2 months

Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study
To gauge the perceptions of security professionals on the state of security in their
organizations, Cisco asked chief security officers (CSOs) and security operations
(SecOps) managers in several countries and at organizations of various sizes about
their perceptions of their own security resources and procedures. The Cisco 2017
Security Capabilities Benchmark Study offers insights on the maturity level of security
operations and security practices currently in use, and also compares these results
with those of the 2016 and 2015 reports. The study was conducted across 13
countries with more than 2900 respondents.
Security professionals want to make their organizations
more secure, but in a way that responds to the complex
attacker landscape and their adversaries’ efforts to expand
their operational space. Many organizations are relying
on many solutions from many vendors. This tactic adds to
the complexity and confusion of securing networks as the
Internet continues to grow in terms of speed, connected
devices, and traffic. Organizations need to aim for simplicity
and integration if they are to protect themselves.

Perceptions: Security Professionals
Confident in Tools, Less Sure They’re
Using Them Effectively
Most security professionals believe that they have adequate
solutions on hand and that their security infrastructures are
up to date. However, according to our study, this confidence
comes with some uncertainty. These professionals are not
always sure they can muster the budgets and brainpower to
truly take advantage of the technology they have.
Threats to organizations are coming from every direction.
Adversaries are nimble and creative, and they’re able to outfox
defenses. Even in this sobering environment, the majority
of security professionals feel confident that their security
49

infrastructure is up to date, although that confidence appears
to be waning a bit from previous years. In 2016, 58 percent of
the respondents said their security infrastructure is very up to
date and is constantly upgraded with the latest technologies.
Thirty-seven percent said they replace or upgrade their
security technologies on a regular basis but aren’t equipped
with the latest-and-greatest tools (Figure 44).

In addition, more than two-thirds of security professionals
perceive their security tools as very effective or extremely
effective. For example, 74 percent believe their tools are
very or extremely effective in blocking known security
threats, while 71 percent believe their tools are effective
at detecting network anomalies and dynamically defending
against shifts in adaptive threats (Figure 45).
The problem: Confidence in tools does not necessarily
transfer to effective security. As the study indicates,
security departments are wrestling with complicated tools
from many vendors, as well as a lack of in-house talent.
This boils down to an “intent versus reality” problem.
Security professionals want simple, effective security tools,
but they don’t have the integrated approach they need to
make this vision happen.
Security remains a high priority for the top levels of many
organizations. And security professionals believe that
executive teams keep security high on the list of key
organizational goals. The challenge, of course, is to match
executive support with the talent and technology that can
affect security outcomes.
The number of security professionals strongly agreeing that
their executive leadership considers security a high priority
was 59 percent in 2016, down slightly from 61 percent
in 2015 and 63 percent in 2014 (Figure 46). In 2016, 55
percent of security professionals agreed that security roles
and responsibilities are clarified within their organization’s
executive team; in 2015 and 2014, 58 percent agreed.
In summary, security professionals have confidence in the
tools on hand, and they appear to have the ear of corporate
leaders in addressing security issues. But that confidence is
waning slightly. Security professionals are becoming aware
of attacker successes and the unwieldiness of managing
the growing attack surface.

Constraints: Time, Talent, and Money Affect the Ability to Respond to Threats
If security professionals are relatively confident that they
have the tools needed to detect threats and mitigate
damage, they also recognize that certain structural
constraints stand in the way of their goals. A tight budget
is a perennial challenge. But other constraints on effective
security speak to the problems of simplifying and
automating security.
In 2016, 35 percent of security professionals said that
budget was their biggest obstacle to adopting advanced
security processes and technology (a slight decrease from
2015, when 39 percent said budget was the number one
obstacle), as seen in Figure 47. As in 2015, compatibility
issues with legacy systems was the second-most-common
obstacle: 28 percent named compatibility in 2016, compared
with 32 percent in 2015.

The struggle to find talent is a concern, considering
the expertise and decision-making abilities needed to
fight targeted attacks and shifting adversary tactics. A
well-resourced and expert IT security team, paired with
the right tools, can make technology and policies work
together and achieve better security outcomes.

Money is only part of the problem. For example, compatibility
issues speak to the problem of disconnected systems that
don’t integrate. And concerns about the lack of trained
personnel highlight the problem of having the tools but
not the talent to truly understand what is happening in the
security environment.

The number of security professionals varies by organizational
size. As shown in Figure 49, 33 percent of large enterprises
with more than 10,000 employees had at least 200
security employees.
Whatever the constraints, security professionals need to
ask hard questions about the barriers that limit their ability
to face coming threats.
For example, when it comes to budget, how much is
really enough? As survey respondents explained, security
teams must compete against many other corporate
priorities, even within the IT setting. If they can’t secure
funds for more tools, then the budget they do have must
work harder. For example, automation can be used to
offset limited manpower.

Outsourcing and the Cloud Help
Stretch Budgets
Many security professionals participating in
the benchmark study felt they were cashstrapped when making security purchases.
They stretched their budget by outsourcing
some tasks or using cloud solutions. They
also relied on automation.

Similar questions should be asked about the software and
hardware compatibility problem. As compatibility issues
multiply, how many different versions of software and
hardware—most of which may not be operating effectively—
must be managed? And how will security teams handle the
multiple certification requirements needed?

Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Aside from those limitations, security professionals
are also placing slightly less emphasis on security
operationalization. This trend may raise concerns
that security professionals are building a suboptimal
security infrastructure. Signs of a weakening focus on
operationalization can indicate that organizations are not
prepared to defend a widening attack landscape.
For example, in 2016, 53 percent of the respondents
strongly agreed that they review and improve security
practices regularly, formally, and strategically; in 2014 and
2015, 56 percent strongly agreed. Likewise, in 2016, 53
percent said they strongly agreed that they routinely and
systematically investigate security incidents, compared with
55 percent in 2014 and 56 percent in 2015 (Figure 50).
If security professionals are slipping in their goals to put
security into use, then it may not be a surprise that they
can’t effectively deploy the tools they have, much less add
new tools. If, as study respondents told us, they cannot use
the technology that they already have on hand, they need
simpler streamlined tools that automate security processes.
And those tools need to provide a holistic picture of what is
going on in the network environment.
The lack of integration in security can allow gaps of time
and space, where bad actors can launch attacks. The
tendency of security professionals to juggle solutions and
platforms from many vendors can complicate assembling
a seamless defense. As seen in Figure 51, a majority of
companies use more than five security vendors and more
than five security products in their environment. Fifty-five
percent of security professionals use at least six vendors;
45 percent use anywhere from one to five vendors; and
65 percent use six or more products.

If operationalization goals are slipping, if tools are not used at
their maximum effectiveness, and if manpower is not robust,
the result is faltering security. Security professionals are forced
to skip the investigation of alerts simply because they do not
have the talent, tools, or automated solutions available to
determine which ones are critical and why they are occurring.
Perhaps due to several factors—such as the lack of an
integrated defense system or the lack of staff time—
organizations are able to investigate a little more than half
the security alerts they receive in a given day. As shown
in Figure 52, 56 percent of alerts are investigated, and
44 percent are not investigated; of those alerts that are
investigated, 28 percent are deemed legitimate alerts.
Forty-six percent of legitimate alerts are then remediated.
To put the problem into more concrete terms, if an
organization records 5000 alerts per day, this means:
● 2800 alerts (56 percent) are investigated, while 2200 (44
percent) are not
● Of those investigated, 784 alerts (28 percent) are legitimate,
while 2016 (72 percent) are not
● Of the legitimate alerts, 360 (46 percent) are remediated,
while 424 (54 percent) are not remediated
54

The fact that nearly half of alerts go uninvestigated should
raise concern. What is in the group of alerts that is not
being remediated: Are they low-level threats that might
merely spread spam, or could they result in a ransomware
attack or cripple a network? To investigate and understand
a greater slice of the threat landscape, organizations
need to rely on automation as well as properly integrated
solutions. Automation can help stretch precious resources
and remove the burden of detection and investigation from
the security team.
The inability to view so many alerts raises questions about
their impact on an organization’s overall success. What
could these uninvestigated threats do to productivity,
customer satisfaction, and confidence in the enterprise?
As respondents told us, even small network outages or
security breaches can have long-term effects on the
bottom line. Even when losses were relatively minor and
the affected systems were fairly easy to identify and
isolate, security leaders regard breaches as significant
because of the stress they put on the organization.
SHARE

Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

The stresses can affect organizations in many ways. Security
teams must devote time to managing network outages that
occur after a security breach. Nearly half of these outages
lasted as long as 8 hours. Forty-five percent of the outages
lasted from 1 to 8 hours (Figure 53); 15 percent lasted 9 to
16 hours, and 11 percent lasted 17 to 24 hours. Forty-one
percent of these outages affected between 11 percent and
30 percent of the organizations’ systems.

Impact: More Organizations Experience
Losses from Breaches
The effects of breaches aren’t limited to outages. Breaches
also mean the loss of money, time, and reputation. Security
teams who believe they will dodge this bullet are ignoring
the reality of the data. As our study shows, almost half
of organizations have had to cope with public scrutiny
following a security breach. Given the attackers’ range of
ability and tactics, the question isn’t if a security breach will
happen, but when.
As the benchmark study shows, security professionals are
jarred into reality when breaches occur. They often change
security strategies or bolster defenses. Organizations that
have not yet suffered a breach of their networks due to
attackers may be relieved they’ve escaped. However, this
confidence is probably misplaced.

Forty-nine percent of the security professionals surveyed
said their organization has had to manage public scrutiny of
a security breach. Of those organizations, forty-nine percent
disclosed the breach voluntarily, while 31 percent said the
disclosure was made by a third-party (Figure 54). In other
words, nearly one-third of the surveyed organizations were
forced to deal with the involuntary disclosure of a breach.
It’s clear that the days of quietly dealing with breaches may
be long gone. There are too many regulators, media, and
social media users who will expose the news.

The damage to organizations goes far beyond the time it takes
to deal with a breach or outage. There are real and substantial
impacts that enterprises should try mightily to avoid.
As seen in Figure 55, 36 percent of security professionals
said that operations was the function most likely to be
affected. This means that core systems of productivity,
which affect industries from transportation to healthcare to
manufacturing, can slow down or even grind to a halt.

56

After operations, finance was the function most likely to be
affected (cited by 30 percent of the respondents), followed
by brand reputation and customer retention (both at
26 percent).
No organization that plans to grow and achieve success
wants to be in a position of having critical departments
affected by security breaches. Security professionals
should view the survey results with an eye toward their
own organizations, and ask themselves: If my organization
suffers this kind of loss from a breach, what happens to the
business down the road?

Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

The opportunity losses for companies suffering online
attacks are daunting. Twenty-three percent of the surveyed
security professionals said that in 2016, their organizations
experienced a loss of opportunity due to attacks (Figure 56).
Of that group, 58 percent said that the total opportunity lost
was under 20 percent; 25 percent said the lost opportunity
was 20 to 40 percent, and 9 percent said the lost opportunity
amounted to 40 to 60 percent.
Many organizations can quantify the revenue losses
they experience due to public breaches. As seen in
Figure 57, 29 percent of security professionals said their
organizations experienced a loss of revenue as a result of
attacks. Of that group, 38 percent said that revenue loss
was 20 percent or higher.
Online attacks also result in fewer customers. As shown
in Figure 58, 22 percent of organizations said they lost
customers as a result of attacks. Of that group, 39 percent
said they lost 20 percent of their customers or more.

Outcomes: Increased Scrutiny Will Play a
Role in Security Improvements
As the survey results show, the impact of breaches
can be long-lasting and widespread. If one assumes
an organization will be affected by a breach at some
point, the question is, what happens next? Where should
management shift their attention and resources so that
breaches are less likely to occur?

The aftermath of a breach is a learning opportunity,
an experience that should not go to waste in terms of
investing in better approaches.
Ninety percent of the security professionals said that a
security breach drove improvements in threat defense
technologies and processes, as shown in Figure 59. Of
those organizations affected by breaches, 38 percent said
they responded by separating the security team from the

Figure 60 Organizations' Reliance on Outsourcing

Organizations recognize that they have to exercise
creativity to move beyond the constraints of talent,
technology compatibility, and budget. One strategy is to
adopt outsourced services to strengthen the budget and
also tap into talent that may not be in-house.

Outsourced Security Services
2016 (n=2912)

In 2016, 51 percent of security professionals outsourced
advice and consulting, while 45 percent outsourced

Trust Versus Cost: What Drives Security Purchases?
Security professionals want the very best solutions for
protecting their organizations, but their perceptions differ
on how to create the ideal secure environment. Do they
purchase best-of-breed solutions from a variety of vendors
because they trust these solutions will solve many different
problems? Or do they turn to an integrated architecture,
because they believe this approach is more cost-effective?
Although there are many drivers for security investments,
greater simplicity can benefit every organization.
As seen in Figure 63, the security professionals seem
evenly split between trust and cost in choosing between
best-of-breed and architected solutions. Sixty-five percent
said they favor best-of-breed solutions because they trust
them more than an enterprise architecture approach. On
the other hand, 59 percent said they favor an architected
approach because they believe it is more cost-effective.

61

This isn’t an either/or dilemma. Organizations need both
best-of-breed and integrated security solutions. Both
approaches offer benefits and will simplify security while
providing automated response tools (Figure 63).
By combining best-of-breed solutions with an integrated
approach, security teams can take steps toward less complex
yet more effective security. The integrated approach helps
security professionals understand what’s happening at every
stage of defense. Such an approach reduces attackers’
operational space. It is simple, allowing teams to deploy
solutions at scale. It is open, allowing for best-of-breed
solutions as needed. And it’s automated for faster detection.

Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Summary: What the Benchmark Study Reveals
There is a world of difference between amassing security
tools and actually having the capability to use those tools to
reduce risk and close the operational space for adversaries.
Respondents to the benchmark study believe they have the
tools that will thwart attackers. But they also acknowledge
that constraints such as a lack of manpower and poor
product compatibility can render good tools much less
effective than they’d hoped.
The sobering findings regarding the impact of breaches
should provide security professionals with ample evidence
of the need to improve processes and protocols. Faced
with real and immediate effects like lost revenue and

62

customers, organizations can no longer simply wish away
gaps in security protection, because the question is not if
a breach will happen, but when.
One takeaway from the benchmark study is that the
constraints limiting agile and effective security will always
be with us: There will never be as much budget and talent
as security professionals believe they need. If we accept
these constraints, then the idea of simplifying security and
deploying automated solutions makes sense.
Simplifying security also makes use of best-of-breed
solutions and an integrated architecture. Organizations
need the benefits of both approaches.

Value Chain Security: Success in a Digital World Hinges on Mitigating Third-Party Risk
Value chain security is an essential element of success
in a connected economy. Ensuring that the right security
is in the right place at the right time throughout the value
chain—the end-to-end lifecycle for hardware, software,
and services—is an imperative.
The eight stages of the value chain are shown in Figure 64.
Information technology and operations technology are
converging in this digitized world. It is not enough for
organizations to focus only on protecting their internal
business models, offerings, and infrastructure. Organizations
must look at their value chain holistically and consider whether
each third-party that is involved in their business model or
touching their offerings poses a risk to their security.
The short answer is that they likely do: Research by the
SANS Institute found that 80 percent of data breaches
originate from third parties.¹⁵ To reduce risk, organizations
must foster a value chain where trust is not implicit and
security is everyone’s responsibility. As a foundational step
toward achieving this goal, organizations should:
● Identify the key players in their third-party ecosystem and
understand what those third parties deliver

● Develop a flexible security architecture that can be shared
with and deployed across the variety of third parties in
that ecosystem
● Assess whether those third parties are operating within the
tolerance levels set by the organization’s security architecture
● Be alert to new security risks that the ecosystem may
present as digitization increases

Organizations must also think about security before
introducing a new business model or an offering that
requires involvement by, or that otherwise affects, their
third-party ecosystem. Any potential value and productivity
gains must be weighed against potential risks, particularly
around data security and privacy.
Awareness of the importance of the value chain is growing
both globally and in specific industry sectors. Recent U.S. IT
procurement legislation mandated a 1-year assessment by
the U.S. Department of Defense regarding open technology
standards in procurements for information technology and
cybersecurity acquisitions.¹⁶ In the highly converged energy
sector, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC) is actively developing new requirements addressing
its cyber value chain.¹⁷

Organizations, together with their third parties, need to answer
questions such as, “How will data be generated and by
whom?” and, “Should the data be digitally mined?” Further
clarity requires determining the answers to such questions as,
“Who owns the digital assets we are collecting or creating?”
and, “With whom must we share that information?” Another
critical question to answer: “Who owns what liability and
obligation when a breach occurs?”
This value chain-centric approach helps ensure that
security considerations are built in at every stage of the
solutions lifecycle. The right architecture, combined with
adherence to the appropriate security standards, will help
to drive pervasive security—and build trust—throughout the
entire value chain.

Geopolitical Update: Encryption, Trust,
and a Call for Transparency
In previous cybersecurity reports, Cisco geopolitical experts
examined the uncertainty in the Internet governance
landscape, the rights of the individual versus the rights
of the state, and the ways that governments and private
businesses might navigate the data-protection dilemma.
One common topic across these discussions has been
encryption. We believe that encryption will continue to
permeate, perhaps even dominate, the cybersecurity
debate for the foreseeable future.
The proliferation of national and regional data privacy
laws has created unease among vendors and users
attempting to navigate those laws. In this uncertain
environment, issues such as data sovereignty and
data localization have come to the fore, helping to fuel
growth in cloud computing and localized data storage as
businesses seek a creative solution to meeting complex
and evolving privacy regulations.¹⁸
At the same time, the escalating number of data breaches
and advanced persistent threats, and the publicity around
hacks sponsored by nation-states—including those
conducted during high-profile events such as the U.S.
presidential election—are making users even less confident
that their sensitive data and privacy will be protected.

Governments in the post-Snowden era have been
increasingly strident in their desire to regulate digital
communications and to access data when needed.
However, users have been just as ardent in their demand
for privacy. Events such as the recent head-butting
between Apple and the FBI over an iPhone belonging to
a terrorist have done nothing to assuage users’ worries
about privacy. If anything, it taught a generation of digital
users, especially in the United States, about end-to-end
encryption. Many users are now demanding end-to-end
encryption from their technology providers, and they want
to hold the encryption keys.
This marks a fundamental shift in the cybersecurity
landscape as we have known it. Organizations are going to
need to architect their environments so they can navigate
and respond to competing agendas.
While this shift is taking place, more governments are
giving themselves the legal right—often on a broad
basis—to bypass or break encryption or technical
protection measures, often without the knowledge of
the manufacturer, communication provider, or the user.
This is creating tension not only between authorities and
technology firms but also between governments, who are
not necessarily keen to see their citizens’ data accessed
by third-country authorities. Many governments collect
information about zero-day exploits and vulnerabilities
that they discover in vendor software; however, they are
not always transparent with vendors about the information
they possess, or sharing it in a timely manner.
Hoarding such valuable information prevents vendors
from improving security in their products and providing
users with better protection from threats. Even though
governments may have good reason to hold some of
this intelligence close, there is also a need for greater
transparency and trust in the global cybersecurity
landscape. Governments therefore should conduct a frank
assessment of their current policies regarding the hoarding
of zero-day exploits. They should start from the default
position that sharing information with vendors can only
lead to a far more secure digital environment for everyone.

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

High-Speed Encryption: A Scalable Solution to Protecting Data in Transit
As explained in the geopolitical section on page 65,
end-to-end encryption will remain a topic of much
debate and consternation between governments
and industry for the foreseeable future. Regardless
of any tension stemming from this issue, however,
user demand for end-to-end data encryption with
customer-held keys is increasing.
Cisco geopolitical experts anticipate that some
streams and pools of data will likely remain encrypted
with vendor-managed keys at least for the short term,
particularly in ad-driven business models. Elsewhere,
however, we should expect to see the use of end-toend encryption with customer-held keys gaining more
traction, absent a legal mandate to the contrary.
Meanwhile, look for organizations to also seek more
control over how they protect their data while it
is in transit, particularly as it moves at high speed
from one data center to another. This was once an
arduous task for enterprises due to the limitations
of legacy technologies and the impact on network
performance. However, new approaches are making
this process easier.
One solution is application-layer security, where
applications are modified to encrypt data.
Deploying this type of security can be very
resource-intensive, complex to implement, and
operationally expensive depending on how many
applications an organization uses.

66

Another approach seeing increased traction is
encryption capabilities built in to a network or cloud
service to protect data in transit. This is an evolution
of the traditional gateway VPN model, a solution
that addresses the dynamic nature of networks and
the high-speed transmission rates of data center
traffic. Enterprises are using the operational and cost
efficiencies provided by the new capabilities to protect
data coming from any application in that environment
as it travels at high speed to another location.
Network-based encryption is only one tool for
protecting data, however. To ensure they are doing
enough to protect their data while it is in transit or
at rest, organizations should look at the challenge
holistically. A good place to begin is by asking
technology vendors basic but important questions
such as:
● How is data protected when it’s in transit?
● How is it protected when it’s at rest?
● Who has access to the data?
● Where is the data stored?
● What is the policy for deleting data, when and if it
must be deleted?

Again, these questions are only a starting point for a
broader dialogue about data protection that should
evolve to include a discussion of topics such as data
resiliency and availability.

Network Performance and Adoption Versus Security Maturity: Online Speeds, Traffic,
and Preparedness Are Not Growing at the Same Pace
Defenders want to stay ahead of their adversaries. To be
behind them is to be in a potentially dangerous place.
The worry is that defenders can’t improve their security
posture at the same pace that adversaries can gain space
and time to operate. Given the pace of growth of fixed and
mobile Internet traffic worldwide, defenders are obligated
to match this growth with gains in the maturity of their
security infrastructure.

Cisco has matched the VNI Forecast to data about
defender maturity, taken from Cisco’s annual Security
Capabilities Benchmark Study (see page 49). In examining
maturity growth rates in the 2015, 2016, and 2017
benchmark reports, as seen in Figure 65, security maturity
is underwhelming compared with the growth of Internet
traffic. Some countries, such as China and Germany,
actually show a slight decline in maturity over this time
period. Broadband speeds, in particular, are improving
and growing at a significantly greater rate than other
networking variables shown in Figure 65. Faster speeds
and more connected devices foster greater traffic growth,
but organizations are struggling to bolster their security
measures and infrastructures at similar rates.

The Cisco VNI Forecast examines global IP traffic
annually, including mobile and Wi-Fi traffic. The forecasts
provide 5-year projections for IP traffic, the number of
Internet users, and the number of personal devices and
machine-to-machine (M2M) connections that will be
supported by IP networks. (Visit here for more details on
the VNI Forecast.) For example, the forecast estimates
that by 2020, smartphones will generate 30 percent of
total IP traffic.

Certain industries also lag in terms of their security maturity

particular, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and transportation
are behind other industries.

is broadly adopted. Global mobile traffic was 5 percent of
total IP traffic in 2015, according to the VNI Forecast; it is
projected to be 16 percent of total IP traffic by 2020.
It’s clear that security organizations must step up their
maturity efforts, and quickly, if they are to match the growth
in Internet traffic, which portends growth in the potential
attack surface. In addition, organizations must respond to the
growth in the use of endpoints that are not fixed or wired to
corporate networks. They must also accommodate a more
widespread use of personal devices from which workers
access corporate data.

It’s important to note that the dramatic rise in mobile
speeds is an outcome of the broad adoption of 4G and
LTE networks by telecommunications providers. When
large-scale deployments of 5G networks become available
toward the end of this decade, mobile speeds are expected
to become comparable to fixed network speeds. According
to the current Mobile VNI Forecast, global mobile traffic
will likely gain a greater share of total IP traffic when 5G

Faster speeds are not the only factor driving growth
of Internet traffic. The IoT is accelerating the number
of devices that are attached to the Internet, not only
adding to the growth of traffic but also adding potential
pathways for attackers.

Conclusion

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Conclusion
A Rapidly Expanding Attack Surface Requires an Interconnected and
Integrated Approach to Security
In analyzing data from Cisco’s Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study (see page 49), we are able to
examine patterns and decisions that help organizations
minimize risk. We can therefore see where they should
make security investments that can lead to a significant
difference in risk exposure. We measured risk by looking at
the lengths of breaches as well as percentages of system
outages (see Figure 53 on page 55 regarding the length of
breaches and the systems affected).
To understand how organizations create effective
safeguards against risk, we need to examine what drivers
affect their ability to prevent, detect, and mitigate risk.
(See Figure 68.) The drivers must include these elements:
● Executive leadership: The top leadership must prioritize
security. This is critical for the mitigation of attacks, as well
as their prevention. The executive team should also have
clear and established metrics for assessing the effectiveness
of a security program.

● Policy: Policy has strong ties to mitigation. Controlling
access rights to networks, systems, applications, functions,
and data will affect the ability to mitigate damage from
security breaches. In addition, policies to ensure a regular
review of security practices will help prevent attacks.
● Protocols: The right protocols can help prevent and
detect breaches, but they also have a strong relationship to
mitigation. In particular, regular reviews of connection activity
on networks, to ensure that security measures are working,
are key to both prevention and mitigation. It’s also beneficial
to review and improve security practices regularly, formally,
and strategically over time.
● Tools: The judicious and appropriate application of tools
has the strongest relationship with mitigation. With tools in
place, users can review and provide feedback that is vital to
detection and prevention as well as mitigation.

Conclusion

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

The security safeguards that organizations use—prevention,
detection, and mitigation—can be viewed as measures of
influence on an organization’s ability to minimize risk.
(See Figure 68.)
These safeguards must include the following elements:
● Prevention: To minimize the impact of security breaches,
employees must report security failures and problems. It’s
also crucial for security processes and procedures to be
clear and well understood.
● Detection: The best detection methods for minimizing the
impact of breaches are those that allow organizations to
spot security weaknesses before they become full-blown
incidents. To accomplish this, it’s vital to have a good system
for categorizing incident-related information.

72

● Mitigation: Well-documented processes and procedures
for incident response and tracking are key to effective breach
mitigation. Organizations also need strong protocols to
manage their response to crises.

All of these drivers and safeguards are interconnected
and interdependent. Security professionals can’t
simply cherry-pick a couple of drivers and one or two
safeguards, and believe they have solved the security
problem. They need every driver, and every safeguard.
Security teams must analyze where their weaknesses
are—for example, low levels of support from leaders, or
a lack of tools to mitigate breaches—and calculate where
investments in security must be made.

Conclusion

Cisco 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report

The Key Goal: Reducing Adversaries’ Operational Space
Reducing—and ideally, eliminating—the unconstrained
operational space of adversaries, and making attackers’
presence known, must be top priorities for defenders.
The reality is that no one can stop all attacks, or protect
everything that can and should be protected. But if you
focus on closing the operational space that cybercriminals
must have for their campaigns to be effective and
profitable, you can prevent them from reaching critical
systems and data without entirely evading detection.
This report categorized different approaches that
adversaries use to compromise and attack users and
systems. We based our categories—reconnaissance,
weaponization, delivery, and installation—on where the
attacks are typically deployed in the attack chain. This
exercise was meant to illustrate when, how, and where
adversaries take advantage of vulnerabilities and other
weaknesses to gain a foothold on a device or in a
system, launch their campaign, and then reap the
rewards they seek.
We suggest that defenders adapt their security approaches
to stay ahead of attackers’ basic processes. For example,
to undermine adversaries during the reconnaissance phase,
security teams should be:
● Gathering information about the latest threats and vulnerabilities
● Ensuring they are controlling access to their networks
● Limiting the organization’s exposure in an expanding
attack surface

When weaponized threats are delivered, defenders must
apply every tool in their arsenal to prevent them from
spreading and worsening. This is where an integrated
security architecture becomes critical. It will provide realtime insight into threats as well as automated detection and
defense, which are essential for improving threat detection.
At the installation phase, security teams must stay informed
about the state of the environment as they respond to and
investigate the compromise. If that environment is simple,
open, and automated, and if defenders have taken the
other proactive steps outlined above, they can then focus
their resources on helping the business to answer critical
questions such as:
● What did the attackers access?
● Why were they able to get to it?
● Where did they go?
● Are they still operating in our network?

The answers to these questions will allow security teams
not only to take appropriate actions to prevent further
attacks, but also to inform management and the board
about possible exposures and necessary disclosures.
Then, the business can begin the process of ensuring that
it has comprehensive controls and mitigations in place to
address any security gaps—the weaknesses that provided
the operational space adversaries needed to succeed—that
were identified during the compromise.

● Managing configurations
● Developing consistent response practices and procedures
that are informed by this work
