Cofense™ Research reports that the Necurs botnet began a new campaign at approximately
7:30 EST on Aug 15, one appearing to be highly targeted at the banking industry. So far,
Cofense has seen over 3,701 bank domains targeted as recipients.
(Update: The campaign appeared to stop as of 15:37 EST. Number of banks targeted was
updated on 8/16/18. We will update this blog post if the situation changes.)
Necurs is a rootkit first observed in 2012. It utilizes multiple Domain Generation Algorithms
(DGA’s) coupled with .bit domain names as well as P2P communications to remain resilient
against shutdown. Necurs became fairly famous when it began sending waves of Dridex and
Locky a few years ago. We have noticed an uptick in campaigns originating from the Necurs
botnet in recent weeks.
What stood out today is what changed. Necurs for months has been sending a seemingly
never-ending stream of typical spam campaigns. Today at 7:30am EST we noticed a new file
extension attached to its phishing campaigns: .PUB, which belongs to Microsoft Publisher.

1/5

Like Word and Excel, Publisher has the ability to embed macros. So just when you are
feeling confident about a layered defense protecting you from Malicious Word docs, Necurs
adapts and throws you a curveball.
The other eyebrow-raising moment is when it was observed that all of the recipients worked
for banks. There were no free mail providers in this campaign, signaling clear intent by the
attackers to infiltrate banks specifically.
The emails are fairly basic and appear to be coming from someone in India with the subject
of “Request BOI” or “Payment Advice <random alpha numeric>”.

The attached file has a Microsoft Publisher, .pub, extension with an embedded macro. When
executed, the macro gets the URL in the UserForm1.Frame1.tag object which further
downloads from a remote host.

Actions taken upon execution of the downloaded file:
Drop a file to $cwd\smth.exe
Drop a copy of 7za.exe
Drop a password protected archive
Unpack with this command: `7za.exe x archive.7z -pX9e5UD6AN1vQCK08DM4O o”C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows” -aoa`
Drops archive.cab, renames to winksys.exe
Launch winksys.exe
In this same phishing campaign targeting Banking employees, a smaller subset of the
samples used weaponized PDF files. These PDF files are identical to ones used in a very
recent campaign which leveraged .iqy files.
The final payload for this campaign is the FlawedAmmyy remote access trojan.
FlawedAmmyy is based on the leaked source code for Ammyy Admin. This tool provides full
remote control of the compromised host leading to file and credential theft as well as serving
as a beachhead for any further lateral movement within the organization.
Again, as this campaign is evolving more than 2,700 bank domains have been target
recipients. The banks range from small regional banks all the way up to the largest financial
institutions in the world. We have not yet determined the actor(s) behind this specific
campaign or the final goal. Cofense will continue to monitor the campaign for additional
developments.
