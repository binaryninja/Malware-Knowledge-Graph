October
We terminated 9 YouTube channels and 1 ads account as part of our investigation into
coordinated influence operations linked to Vietnam. The campaign uploaded
conspiracy theory content in English and Korean. We believe this operation was
financially motivated
We terminated 4 AdSense accounts and blocked 22 domains from eligibility to appear
on Google News surfaces and Discover as part of our investigation into a reported
coordinated influence operation linked to India. The campaign uploaded a variety of
news content in English to domains that were designed to look as if they were
independent news outlets in various US states and European countries. We believe
this operation was financially motivated. We received leads from the FBI that supported
us in this investigation.
We terminated 37 YouTube channels and 4 blogs as part of our investigation into
coordinated influence operations linked to Sudan. The campaign uploaded content in
Arabic that was supportive of the Sudanese military. Our findings are similar to findings
reported by Facebook.
We terminated 3 YouTube channels as part of our investigation into coordinated
influence operations linked to Uganda. The campaign uploaded content in English that
was critical of Ugandan opposition political parties. Our findings are similar to findings
reported by Twitter.
We terminated 3,311 YouTube channels as part of our ongoing investigation into
coordinated influence operations linked to China. These channels mostly uploaded
spammy content in Chinese about music, entertainment, and lifestyle. A very small
subset uploaded content in Chinese and English about China’s COVID-19 vaccine
efforts and social issues in the U.S. These findings are consistent with our previous
reports.

November
We terminated 86 YouTube channels and 3 blogs as part of our investigation into
coordinated influence operations linked to Nicaragua. The campaign posted content in
Spanish that was supportive of the Nicaraguan government and critical of opposition
political parties. Our findings are similar to findings reported by Facebook.
We terminated 15,368 YouTube channels as part of our ongoing investigation into
coordinated influence operations linked to China. These channels mostly uploaded
spammy content in Chinese about music, entertainment, and lifestyle. A very small
subset uploaded content in Chinese and English about China’s COVID-19 vaccine
efforts and social issues in the U.S. These findings are consistent with our previous
reports. The increased takedown volume compared to prior months is the result of
adjustments made to our detection model, and we do not believe it reflects an increase
in activity by this campaign.
