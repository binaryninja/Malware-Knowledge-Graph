This blog is a product of ongoing collaboration with @ninoseki, a Tokyo-based
researcher who has tracked MoqHao for several years. His public GitHub contains
numerous useful OSINT threat hunting tools.

Introduction
MoqHao (also referred to as Wroba and XLoader) is a malware family commonly associated
with the Roaming Mantis threat actor group. MoqHao is generally used to target Android
users, often via an initial attack vector of phishing SMS messages (smishing).
Roaming Mantis are characterized as Chinese-speaking and financially motivated. The
group has historically targeted countries in the Far East – in particular Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan.
We have previously blogged on a MoqHao campaign targeting Japan during the Golden
Week holiday period in April/May 2021.
In the recent past, several vendors (e.g., Kaspersky) have noted an expansion in Roaming
Mantis’ operations to include several European countries.

Germany (August 2021)
In this blog we will examine open-source hints attributable to the threat actors,
coupled with Team Cymru’s insights, to provide an assessment of Roaming Mantis’
current target base.

Landing Pages
When following a malicious link distributed in a Roaming Mantis smishing campaign, users
are directed to a landing page. These pages are tailored specifically to a target country /
language; users from other regions are presented with an error page (404 – resource not
found).

2/9

Based on the user-agent information for the connecting device, one of two outcomes will
occur:
.
For Android devices, a malicious APK (MoqHao) is downloaded.
.
For Apple (iOS) devices, the user is presented with a phishing page where they are
asked to enter credentials for a spoofed entity.
Landing Page Characteristics

To determine common characteristics of the infrastructure utilized for the hosting of Roaming
Mantis landing pages, 43 IP addresses, which were observed hosting these pages since the
beginning 2022, were analyzed. The following findings were true across all the IPs:
.
The re-use of the same X.509 certificate (SHA1:
834024f91f67445a7fd1a98689cb3f49b4c3ade7), hosted on TCP/443. This certificate
has a common name value of localhost and an alt name value which contains (at the
time of reporting) 335 legitimate domains, summarized as follows:
South Korean entities, such as Naver and Daum.
ccTLDs for .kr (South Korea) and .tw (Taiwan).
.
The presence of Merlin command and control (C2) infrastructure listening on TCP/443,
based on the detection of a JARM fingerprint for this service
(29d21b20d29d29d21c41d21b21b41d494e0df9532e75299f15ba73156cee38).
.
Open ports; TCP/5985, TCP/10081, TCP/47001.
.
Passive scanning of TCP/10081 on the landing page hosting IPs indicated an additional
HTTP service listening on this port. The HTML title value for this service provides useful
insight into victim targeting, as summarized in Table 1 below.

Table 1: Insight derived from TCP/10081 on the Landing Page hosting IPs
As can be seen, in addition to campaigns targeting France, Germany, Japan, South
Korea, and the United States, infrastructure was set up for the specific targeting of
UK-based users. This finding would indicate a further expansion of Roaming Mantis’
operations within Europe.

MoqHao Command & Control
In this section we will examine network telemetry relating to the connections made once the
malicious APK (MoqHao) is installed on a victim Android device.
By examining this stage of the attack, it is possible to identify potential victims with a higher
degree of certainty. This confidence is based on the chain of events leading to this point, i.e.,
a user has interacted with a link contained within an SMS message, visited a landing page,
and the malicious APK has successfully been deployed on the user’s device to the point
where it has begun to beacon to the C2 server.

The starting point for this part of the analysis was a MoqHao sample (SHA1:
74558f86e4b4513f7f52d6b99b7e06d978aec97b) uploaded to VirusTotal by a user in the
United Kingdom on March 16, 2022.
Analysis of this sample identified a C2 server hosted on 103.249.28.207 (EHOSTICT, KR).
Network telemetry for this IP revealed a small number of connections inbound on
TCP/28866, sourced from IP addresses assigned to UK mobile providers.
In addition, 103.249.28.207 was observed as a C2 server in what appeared to be four further
campaigns:
.
TCP/28866 – Spain, Turkey
.
TCP/29869 – South Africa
.
TCP/28844 – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Iran, and Pakistan (South Asia)
.

Figure 2: Victim connections to 103.249.28.207
.
Passive scanning of 103.249.28.207 identified open TCP/3389 (commonly associated with
the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)), with a machine name of WIN-MM79JTRSTL7.

6/9

As an aside, screen captures of RDP activity on 103.249.28.207, sourced from Shodan,
provided another ‘Chinese’ flag for this activity.
As recently as January 05, 2022, a remote login page was captured (associated with
machine name WIN-MM79JTRSTL7), which indicated Chinese language settings – the
characters 密码, meaning ‘password’ in Mandarin, were displayed.
.

.
This login page was visible dating back to the end of 2020, all the time associated with the
same machine name (WIN-MM79JTRSTL7). A screen capture from January 22, 2020,
indicated Korean language settings – the characters 암호, meaning ‘password’ in Korean,
were displayed.
.

.
Given that 103.249.28.207 is assigned to a South Korean provider (Ehost IDC), the
information from Shodan may be indicative of a Chinese-speaking user accessing / utilizing
the machine since late 2020.
A pivot on the value WIN-MM79JTRSTL7 identified a further eight IP addresses, all assigned
to EHOSTICT, KR, which were accessed by the same machine. Network telemetry data was
obtained for these IPs for the beginning of 2022 onwards, where MoqHao campaigns were
identified, they are referenced in Table 2 below

Table 2: Summary of MoqHao C2 servers
.
In the case of 103.249.28.210, samples uploaded to VirusTotal in early 2021 provide an
indication as to when it was an active MoqHao C2. For the remaining IPs it is not clear if they
were previously MoqHao C2s. One possibility may be that they are being configured for
future use.
Although not an exhaustive study of MoqHao C2 infrastructure, it is clear from the
findings of this analysis and other findings from the community, that Roaming Mantis
continue to expand their operations. What was previously considered to be a regional
threat now has a global footprint.
