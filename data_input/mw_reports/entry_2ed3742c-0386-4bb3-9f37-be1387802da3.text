In June 2020, 360 Security Center discovered a new backdoor Pyark written in Python by
the fileless attack protection function. Through in-depth excavation and trace analysis of
the backdoor, we discovered a series of advanced threat actions that have been active
since 2019. By invading various military institutions in Venezuela, the attackers deployed
backdoor to continuously monitor and steal the latest military secrets. We named it APTC-43 based on 360’s way of naming the APT organization
When tracing the attacker’s source, we found that the duration of this attack coincided
with the Venezuelan political chaos, and the network assets used by the attackers were
mostly deployed in Colombia, and some assets were frequently found in Venezuela and
Colombia. After the United Venezuelan coup, the reactionary government headed by Juan
Gerardo Guaidó Márquez fled to Colombia to seek military assistance. We guess the
political background of APT-C -43’s campaign may be to help the reactionaries led by
Juan steal military secrets of the Venezuelan military and provide intelligence support for
the confrontation between the reactionary government and the current Venezuelan
government. Therefore, we named this series of attacks HpReact.
In the process of tracing the source, the campaign was linked to the APT group Machete,
and Machete can be traced back to 2010. The organization is an APT organization with
Spanish roots. Its targets are military, embassies and government agencies in Latin
America. the Lord. Obviously, the HpReact campaign is only a small part of the
organization’s cyber warfare in Latin America.
The picture below shows the decoy document used by APT-C-43 in this campaign. The
content of the document is a policy issued by the Venezuelan authorities to prevent
deserters from going to Colombia to support the reactionary government. More about this
policy. For details, please refer to Appendix 1. It can be seen that the attackers have a
good understanding of Venezuela’s current politics, military, etc., and are good at using
such sensitive files to make decoy documents, which are highly targeted and inductive.

Technical Details
The APT-C-43 organization is good at launching attacks using phishing emails, and
deploys the backdoor program Pyark (Machete) written in python after invading the
victim’s machine. The network communication mainly relies on FTP and HTTP protocols.

After successfully infiltrating the target machine, APT-C-43 organization monitors the
target users, steal sensitive data, etc. The complete process of infecting the target machine
is as follows:

The infection process
The decoy document carries malicious macrocode. Download the next stage of malicious
component NisSrv.bat through FTP protocol, and we can see many variables named after
Spanish vocabulary in the code, such as servidor (server), Usuario (user name),
Contraseña (password), etc.:

The file of “setupXOX.msi” is a Windows Installer installation program made by MSI
Wrapper to deploy the final backdoor components. When we studied the historical
samples of the Machete organization, we found that the organization’s technology for
deploying backdoor has undergone an important change, with a clear time division.
Through the following timeline, we can clearly see that the organization is constantly
changing and innovating its own Attack technique:

Many fields in the installation program are forged into Acrobat Reader installation
program, and the interface after running is related to Acrobat Reader:

After the program runs, the Fpyark backdoor components will be released to the
%ProgramData%\USOEnable directory. The backdoor of Fpyark is writing by python.
During the running process, python is required to execute the environment and various
dependent libraries required by the script, which also caused the size of setupXOX.msi to
reach 8.10M. After installation, the entire directory structure is as follows:

After deploying the above backdoor components, run svchostt.exe according to the
msiwpper configuration file:

The file of “setupXOX.msi” is a virus releaser written in Microsoft Visual Basic language,
which releases NisSrv.bat registered scheduled tasks to realize self-starting and staying.
The program has the following vbp compilation path:

Backdoor module
UpdateSession is the main control module of the backdoor. Its functions include selfstarting of the backdoor, collection of network configuration, keystroke records, and
schedule other modules to execute by means of timers:

UpdateService traverses the disk directory and collects more than ten kinds of sensitive
files with suffixes such as doc, xlsx, and pdf in other directories, except for some system
directories and security software directories.

Summary
The entire campaign of HpReact highly coincides with the timeline of Venezuelan
political turmoil. APT-C-43 took Venezuelan military agencies as the main targets and
carried out surveillance and stealing activities for about two years, forming a significant
impact on Venezuela’s national security. Great safety hazard. In recent years, with the
intensification of cyber warfare in various countries, cyberspace security has become
another important area for each country to maintain national security, and building a
strong cybersecurity has become a top priority for each country.
At present, 360 Total Security has supported the detection of attacks on this organization.

Team Introduction
360 Baize Lab (formerly 360 FirstAid team): Focusing on BOOTKIT/ROOTKIT Trojan
analysis and traceability, it was the first to discover the world’s first UEFI Trojan Spy
Shadow（UEFI⽊马谍影），boot area Trojan Hidden Soul（引导区⽊马隐魂），dual
guns（双枪,）and multiple large-scale dark brush botnets, such as black fog and diaster.
Now it is renamed 360 Baize Lab based on the original business, it is involved in APT
testing and research. The laboratory provides core safety data for 360 Security Guards,
360 FirstAid team and other products, as well as stubborn Trojan detection and killing
solutions, while providing 360 Security Center Technical Support.
