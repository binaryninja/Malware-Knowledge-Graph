OVERVIEW
A cyberespionage campaign against a range of targets, mainly in the energy sector, gave
attackers the ability to mount sabotage operations against their victims. The attackers,
known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically
important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the sabotage capabilities
open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to the energy supply in the affected
countries.
The Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, are a capable
group who are evolving over time and targeting primarily the energy sector and related
industries. They have been in operation since at least 2011 but may have been active even
longer than that. Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies in the US
and Canada before shifting its focus to US and European energy firms in early 2013. More
recent targets have included companies related to industrial control systems.
Dragonfly has used spam email campaigns and watering hole attacks to infect targeted
organizations. The group has used two main malware tools: Trojan.Karagany and
Backdoor.Oldrea. The latter appears to be a custom piece of malware, either written by
or for the attackers.

TIMELINE

A newer approach
used by the attackers
involves
compromising the
update site for several
industrial control
system (ICS) software
producers.

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

Timeline

Figure 1. Timeline of Dragonfly operations
Symantec observed spear phishing attempts in the form of emails with PDF attachments from February 2013
to June 2013. The email topics were related to office administration issues such as dealing with an account or
problems with a delivery. Identified targets of this campaign were mainly US and UK organizations within the
energy sector.
In May 2013, the attackers began to use the Lightsout exploit kit as an attack vector, redirecting targets from
various websites. The use of the Lightsout exploit kit has continued to date, albeit intermittently. The exploit kit
has been upgraded over time with obfuscation techniques. The updated version of Lightsout became known as
the Hello exploit kit.
A newer approach used by the attackers involves compromising the update site for several industrial control
system (ICS) software producers. They then bundle Backdoor.Oldrea with a legitimate update of the affected
software. To date, three ICS software producers are known to have been compromised.
The Dragonfly attackers used hacked websites to host command-and-control (C&C) software.
Compromised websites appear to consistently use some form of content management system.

Victims
The current targets of the Dragonfly group,
based on compromised websites and hijacked
software updates, are the energy sector and
industrial control systems, particularly those
based in Europe. While the majority of victims
are located in the US, these appear to mostly
be collateral damage. That is, many of these
computers were likely infected either through
watering hole attacks or update hijacks and
are of no interest to the attacker.
By examining victims with active infections –
where additional malicious activity has been
detected – it is possible to gather a more
accurate picture of ‘true’ victims.
The most active infections, as in Figure 2, are

Figure 2. Top 10 countries by active infection

in Spain, followed in order by the US, France, Italy, and Germany.

Tools and tactics
Dragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are Remote Access Tool (RAT) type malware
which provide the attackers with access and control of compromised computers. Dragonfly’s favored malware
tool is Backdoor.Oldrea, which is also known as Havex or the Energetic Bear RAT. Oldrea acts as a back door for
the attackers on to the victim’s computer, allowing them to extract data and install further malware.
Oldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some
indication of the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group. The second main tool used by Dragonfly
is Trojan.Karagany. Unlike Oldrea, Karagany was available on the underground market. The source code for
version 1 of Karagany was leaked in 2010. Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken this source code
and modified for its own use.
Symantec found that the majority of computers compromised by the attackers were infected with Oldrea.
Karagany was only used in around 5 percent of infections. The two pieces of malware are similar in functionality
and what prompts the attackers to choose one tool over another remains unknown.

Spam campaign
The Dragonfly group has
used at least three infection
tactics against targets in the
energy sector. The earliest
method was an email spear
phishing campaign, which saw
selected executives and senior
employees in target companies
receive emails containing a
malicious PDF attachment.
Infected emails had one of two
subject lines: “The account”
or “Settlement of delivery
problem”. All of the emails were
from a single Gmail address.
Figure 3 displays the number of
different recipients per day.
The spam campaign began in
February 2013 and continued
Figure 3. Spam campaign activity from mid-February 2014 to mid-June 2013
into June 2013. Symantec
identified seven different
organizations targeted in this
campaign. At least one organization was attacked intermittently for a period of 84 days.

Watering hole attacks
In June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole attacks. They compromised a number of energyrelated websites and injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected visitors to another
compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet
Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer. The fact that the attackers compromised
multiple legitimate websites for each stage of the operation is further evidence that the group has strong
technical capabilities.

In September 2013,
Dragonfly began using
a new version of this
exploit kit, known as the
Hello exploit kit. The
landing page for this kit
contains JavaScript which
fingerprints the system,
identifying installed
browser plugins. The
victim is then redirected
to a URL which in turn
determines the best
exploit to use based on
the information collected.
Figure 4 shows the
compromised websites
categorized into their
respective industries.
Fifty percent of identified
targets were energy
Figure 4. Targeted industries over time
industry related and
thirty percent were
energy control systems, as shown in Figure 4. A clear shift in the attackers targeting can be seen in March 2014
when energy control systems become the primary target.

Trojanized software
The most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of a number of legitimate software
packages. Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the software
bundles they had made available for download on their websites.

Source time zone
Analysis of the compilation timestamps
on the malware used by the attackers
indicate that the group mostly worked
between Monday and Friday, with activity
mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period
that corresponded to a 9am to 6pm
working day in the UTC +4 time zone.

Figure 6. Number of samples compiled per day, UTC time zone

Conclusion
The Dragonfly group is technically adept and able to think strategically. Given the size of some of its targets, the
group found a “soft underbelly” by compromising their suppliers, which are invariably smaller, less protected
companies.

APPENDIX

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

Appendix - Technical Description
Identification of this group is based on the use of two malware families and an exploit kit. The malware families
utilized are Backdoor.Oldrea and Trojan.Karagany. The exploit kit is known as Lightsout and/or Hello. Hello is an
updated iteration of Lightsout that the Dragonfly group began to use in September 2013.
Use of Backdoor.Oldrea appears to be limited to the Dragonfly group. In addition, specific instances of Trojan.
Karagany have been used by this group. Karagany is a Russian RAT sold on underground forums. Instances of
this malware related to the Dragonfly group are identified based on them being delivered through the Lightsout
exploit kit and also a particular packer that this group used. Symantec detects the Trojan.Karagany packer used
by this group as Trojan.Karagany!gen1.
The Lightsout exploit kit is a simple exploit kit that is consistently used to deliver primarily Backdoor.Oldrea and,
in several instances, Trojan.Karagany.

Lightsout exploit kit
A number of sites that use content
management systems were exploited and
an iframe was used in order to redirect
visitors to sites hosting the Lightsout
exploit kit.
An example of an injected iframe can be
seen in figure 7.
Figure 7. Example of injected iframe link
The exploit kit uses browser (e.g.
Internet Explorer and Firefox) and Java
exploits in order to deliver either Backdoor.Oldrea or Trojan.Karagany.
An example of the structure of the Lightsout exploit kit can be seen Table 1. Note that file names and exploits
used may vary.

The values of the [EK_DETERMINED_PARAMETER]
variable may relate to the two different file types
represented by Backdoor.Oldrea and Trojan.
Karagany!gen1 payloads. Oldrea payloads are DLL
files (URLs end in “d” for DLL?) while Karagany!gen1
payloads are portable executables (URLs end in “e”
for EXE?).

Backdoor.Oldrea
At the core of Backdoor.Oldrea is a persistent component that interacts with C&C servers to download and
execute payloads. The components are downloaded by reaching out to the C&C server and performing a GET
request which returns an HTML page containing a base64 encoded string between two comments marked with
the ‘havex’ string.

Installation
File system modifications
• %Temp%\qln.dbx
• %System%\TMPprovider038.dll

Registry modifications
In this specific example, the ‘038’ in the file name indicates the major version number.
• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\”TmProvider”
• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\”TmProvider”
• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\InternetRegistry\”fertger”
• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\InternetRegistry

Code injection
• Backdoor.Oldrea injects code into explorer.exe.

Networking
Post infection, Backdoor.Oldrea will attempt to collect system information such as OS, user name, computer
name, country, language, nation, Internet adapter configuration information, available drives, default browser,
running processes, desktop file list, My Documents, Internet history, program files, and root of available drives.
It also collects data from Outlook (address book) and ICS related software configuration files. This data is
collected and written to a temporary file in an encrypted form before it is POST’ed to a remote C&C server. The
following are examples of a POST request and a POST response:

Various samples process the C&C responses differently.
In one example, the sample searches for the data enclosed by the tag ‘havex’. Once the data is found, it is
decoded using standard base64 + bzip2 and also a xor layer with bytes from the string 1312312. The decoded
data contains a small header followed by an executable MZ-file.
Another sample was found to use standard base64 + reverse xor + RSA-2048 for decrypting received data. The
decrypted data consists of a 6 byte command concatenated with an MZ file. The MZ file is compressed with the
lzma algorithm. RSA keys for decryption, together with other initial configuration information, are stored in the
registry in base64 form.

Payloads
This section includes information about identified payloads downloaded by Backdoor.Oldrea.
The following is a brief description of the functionality for each identified component:
• Tmpprovider is a persistent component that interacts with the C&C server (downloads and executes payloads).
• The InstallerFormDll component usually embeds another executable (DLL) in its resource section to be
loaded. The sample analyzed carried a Web browser password recovery tool originating from
http://securityxploded.com/browser-password-decryptor.php
• The RunExeCmdSingle component is a DLL file that drops and executes another executable. The export
‘runDll’ of this file is where the logic is implemented.
• DropCommandsCmd is a cleanup module, used to remove traces of itself from the infected computer.
• The GetFileCmd modules check for the existence of specific files on the infected host. The two samples look
for the ICS related software file and Outlook’s autocomplete address book file (outlook.nk2).

Page 12

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

Trojan.Karagany
Trojan.Karagany is a back door used primarily for recon. It is designed to download and install additional files
and exfiltrate data. Samples sometimes use common binary packers such as UPX and Aspack on top of a custom
Delphi binary packer/protector for the payload. Where present in samples, the Delphi packer is configured to use
‘neosphere’ as a key to decrypt the payload.
The following is a brief overview of the functionality of Trojan.Karagany:
• Can upload, download, and execute files on the system
• Has plugin capability (may load several plugins for added functionality, such as Web injects)
• Payload is approximately 72Kb in size and is programmed in C/C++
• Contains a small embedded DLL file, which monitors WSASend and send APIs for capturing ‘Basic
Authentication’ credentials

Installation
Trojan.Karagany creates a folder in the user APPDATA directory and chooses the directory name from the
following list:
• Microsoft WCF services
• Broker services
• Flash Utilities
• Media Center Programs
• Policy Definitions
• Microsoft Web Tools
• Reference Assemblies
• Analysis Services
• InstallShield Information
• IIS SQL Server
• Diagnostics
• NTAPI Performance
• WPF Platform
It copies itself in the created directory with hidden and system attributes using a file name chosen from the
following list:
• SearchIndexer.exe
• ImeBroker.exe
• fsutil.exe
• PnPutil.exe
• BdeUISrv.exe
• WinSAT.exe
• pwNative.exe
• SnippingTool.exe
• DFDWizard.exe
• PrintBrmEngine.exe
• WbemMonitor.exe
• dxpserver.exe
• PowerMng.exe

Page 13

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

Trojan.Karagany copies itself with hidden and system attributes where it was first executed as err.log[DIGITS]. It
then copies the legitimate chkdsk utility in the installation folder using the payload file name but with a space before
the file extension. This may fool ordinary users into thinking that this folder contains a legitimate application, for
example PnPutil .exe. Trojan.Karagany!gen1 may create the following additional files in the installation folder:
• Form.api
• inact.api
• prog.cer
• Cent.api
• ie.pdb
It then creates a C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\gl directory as a temporary directory used for uploading files.
Trojan.Karagany then creates a link to itself in the Startup folder as an autostart when the system restarts.

Networking
Trojan.Karagany first checks for a live Internet connection by visiting Microsoft or Adobe websites. It will only reach
out to its C&C server once this check is successful.
