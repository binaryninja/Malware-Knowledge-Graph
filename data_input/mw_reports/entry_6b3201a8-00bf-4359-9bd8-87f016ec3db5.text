Context Information Security’s threat intel and response teams says
it has evidence that the recent supply chain attacks on Airbus are
the work of a newly identified group called Avivore

A number of high-profile cyber attacks on Airbus in the past 12 months, which exploited
virtual private networks (VPNs) used by some of its supply chain partners to access the
aerospace firm’s systems, is likely to have been the work of a previously unidentified threat
group, according to Context Information Security’s researchers.
Dubbed Avivore, the group’s existence came to light during Context’s investigation of a
number of attacks against multinational enterprises that compromise smaller engineering
services and consultancies working in their supply chains.
In such supply chain attacks – also known as Island Hopping – the adversary uses legitimate
connectivity or collaboration tools to bypass the target’s perimeters. These attacks will often
see criminals using chains of activity or connections spanning multiple business and
geographical locations in the victim environment.
The Avivore group, which has not been identified or tracked before, seems to have targeted
assets related to a number of verticals besides aerospace and defence, including
automotive, energy, and space and satellite technology.
“Previous reporting into recent incidents affecting aerospace and defence have linked this
activity to APT10 and JSSD (Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security). Though the nature
of the activity makes attribution challenging, our experience of the campaign suggests a new
group that we have codenamed Avivore,” said Oliver Fay, principal threat intelligence analyst
at Context.
The group appears to operate in the UTC +8 timezone and exploits the PlugX remote access
Trojan, which has been used extensively by APT10.
However, its tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), infrastructure and other tooling is
significantly different to known Chinese-state actors. It is this that has led Context to the
conclusion that Avivore is a previously untracked nation state-level adversary.

According to Context, the group is a “highly capable” actor, skilled at living-off-the-land and
obfuscating its activity in the day-to-day business activities of its victims’ employees. It also
appears to have a high degree of operational security awareness – for example, it clears
forensic artefacts as it progresses to make detection harder.
“The capability of the threat actor makes detecting these incidents challenging, however the
complex nature of the supplier relationship makes investigation, co-operation and
remediation a significant issue,” said James Allman-Talbot, head of cyber incident response
at Context.
“When the organisation that has enabled the intrusion forms a critical part of your value
chain, the operational business risk increases dramatically and difficult decisions need to be
made in a short space of time.”
Context set out a number of recommendations for enterprises to consider adopting whether
they are likely to be a target of a supply chain attack or not.
These include imposing access limitations on supplier and partner connections using VPNs,
such as preventing use outside business hours, agreeing specific locations and IP addresses
for access, and imposing restrictions on access to data and other assets.
Other useful steps could include introducing multifactor authentication and enhancing
auditing and logging at hosts and services into which suppliers connect.
Steps should also be taken to ensure that remote access services implement appropriate log
retention; to ensure that credentials for remote services are stored securely and their use
monitored; and where possible, to make applications, documents and technical information
relating to enterprise networks and remote access services available only to engineers and
IT support staff.

When it comes to comparing SD-WAN vs. VPN services, enterprises choosing between
the technologies should consider factors like cost, cloud usage and application
awareness.
With help from artificial intelligence and automation, client VPN technologies could
innovate the way they handle data flows in hybrid cloud environments.
VPN company NordVPN has introduced NordLynx technology built around the
WireGuard protocol.
