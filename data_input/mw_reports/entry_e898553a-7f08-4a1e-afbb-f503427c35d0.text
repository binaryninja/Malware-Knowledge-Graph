ransomware playbook

Executive summary
Cisco Talos recently became aware of a leaked playbook that has been attributed to the
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group Conti. Talos has a team of dedicated, native-level
speakers that translated these documents in their entirety into English. We also translated a
Cobalt Strike manual that the authors referenced while creating their playbook.
These documents, written mostly in Cyrillic, were allegedly released by an affiliate upset with
Conti. We believe that this translation is an extremely important contribution to the
community, as machine-translated efforts have missed some interesting insights and led to
some garbled passages.
Notably, the LockBit operator we interviewed warned us that something like this would take
place. They stated that in a ransomware cartel, "Someone will sell them out from the inside,"
which is allegedly what took place in this case. The LockBit operator also told us that
ransomware actors use various channels on the messaging app Telegram to stay on top of

1/8

the latest exploits and attack trends. A look into a list of Telegram channels deemed
interesting by the playbook authors shows numerous channels that were potentially
leveraged for this exact use.
Talos' main takeaway from this playbook is that operators of all skill levels are involved with
Conti. Some adversaries who are very new to the malware scene could follow this playbook
to compromise a major, enterprise network with relatively little experience. At the end of this
post, we've attached a full English translation of the documents.

Translation notes
While translating, our linguists discovered many grammatical mistakes, potentially indicating
the writing process was rushed. But based on the language used, the authors likely possess
at least a high school education. It is unclear whether the document was originally written
entirely in Russian or they machine translated some English-language documents and
included them in the playbook. The document contains some peculiar word choices that
could be caused by auto-translation, or just poor writing. The playbook contains transliterated
abbreviations, words and phrases, though this could be because there are no equivalents in
Russian or the authors were unaware or preferred not to use them. However, even if it
included machine translations, the playbook was likely later reviewed and edited to sound
natural for a Russian-speaking audience. Regardless, it is clear that the authors pulled
information from a variety of open-source materials in compiling the document. There are
French passages present in various documents, as well, but only as examples of Cobalt
Strike output, likely indicating that they were created during or copied from an attack
targeting French companies.

Insights into the adversary
References to team leads, chats and conferences indicate that the group is at least
somewhat well-organized. They also display a familiarity with corporate network
environments, such as where prized assets are located and how to access them. This is
particularly true for U.S. and European networks, which they note have enhanced
documentation that provides for easier targeting. Of note, the only "geographical" mention by
the adversaries was the mention of U.S./EU active directory (AD) structures. Their
instructions, which are meticulous and easy to follow, also demonstrate that they are efficient
and methodical.
Through the leaker's posts, we learned that the alleged salary for a Conti pentester was
around $1,500 USD. Several dark web posts noted that this was relatively low and others
said it is more profitable to be legitimately employed than to work with Conti, based on their
2/8

low payments as a whole.

Insights into the leaker
From information derived from the dark web, we learned the alleged identity of the leaker is
"m1Geelka." This is apparently a young individual who was a lower-level member of Conti.

m1Geelka claims that they are not a pentester but are interested in IT.
Based on information from their Telegram account, they appear to be based in Ukraine.
M1Geelka claimed they were not paid by Conti for their services, prompting them to release
this information to exact revenge on Conti.

Later, they claimed they leaked the documents to better understand Conti and not for
revenge, and they only leaked elements that could be detectable by anti-virus (AV) software,
not more private elements, since the leaker respects the work of their coders.

m1Geelka clarifies their reasons for leaking the documents.

Barrier to entry
4/8

One of the biggest takeaways during the translation was the overall thoroughness and detail
of these playbooks. The level of detail provided could allow even amateur adversaries to
carry out destructive ransomware attacks, a much lower barrier to entry than other forms of
attacks. This lower barrier to entry also may have led to the leak by a disgruntled member
who was viewed as less technical (aka "a script kiddie") and less important.

Hunting for admin access
The adversaries list several ways to hunt for administrator access once on the victim
network. They use commands such as Net to list users and tools like AdFind to enumerate
users with access to Active Directory, and even OSINT, including the use of social media
sites like LinkedIn to identify roles and users with privileged access. They note that this
hunting process is particularly easy in U.S. and EU networks because of how they are
structured and how roles and responsibilities are commonly detailed in comments.

Cobalt Strike
The primary tool described in this playbook is the red-teaming framework Cobalt Strike. The
release included a version 4.3 of Cobalt Strike, and the JARM hash for the server matched
what we would expect from a cracked Cobalt Strike server. The tool worked well. The
playbook also pulled heavily from a Russian-language manual describing how to conduct
attacks against Active Directory. We identified the Russian manual the authors were
leveraging, and have translated and included it as well in this report.

Tools listed by the adversary
Besides Cobalt Strike, our linguists identified several other tools and native Windows utilities
listed in the playbook. Of the tools and utilities mentioned, many have been commonly
associated with previous ransomware operations, while others appear to be less familiar. Of
the tools and command-line utilities the adversary mentioned, Talos identified those that
have been commonly used by ransomware operators for reconnaissance and discovery,
such as the use of ADFind to query for information on Active Directory (AD), and whoami to
enumerate groups the user is a member of.
These actors also appear to be using two tools — Armitage and SharpView — that are not
commonly seen in Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) ransomware engagements.
Armitage is a red-team toolkit built on the Metasploit framework that enables the user to

6/8

launch exploits, scans, and more, while SharpView is a .NET port of PowerView, one of
many tools contained within the PowerSploit offensive PowerShell toolkit.
SharpChrome and SeatBelt — two other tools we have not seen used in CTIR ransomware
engagements — were also used for credential-dumping. SharpChrome is a Chrome-specific
implementation of SharpDPAPI and attempts to decrypt logins and cookies. SeatBelt is a
project written in C# that collects system data such as OS information (version, architecture),
UAC system policies, user folders and more.

Comparisons to previous ransomware IR engagements involving Conti
Once our linguists translated the documents, we compared some of the techniques
mentioned in the manuals and guides with activities and TTPs we have observed in CTIR
engagements that involved the Conti ransomware. In many ransomware engagements, CTIR
typically observes the adversary using PowerShell to disable Windows Defender real-time
monitoring. This is in contrast to the adversary's instructions to manually disable real-time
monitoring, which is much more interactive and time-consuming.
However, PowerShell wasn't the only tool mentioned by these adversaries to disable
Windows Defender — the adversaries suggest using GMER as an alternative. GMER is a
tool CTIR has observed across a few ransomware engagements, including at least one Conti
engagement. GMER is marketed as an "anti-rootkit" tool and has been used by ransomware
actors to identify protections and AV and to stop or remove them. Monitoring for the
execution of GMER could help identify precursor activity to ransomware events. Since
GMER hasn't been updated in several years, hash-based tracking is easy and effective.
CTIR assessed in at least one Conti engagement with a high degree of confidence that the
adversary potentially had access to every account within the active directory (AD)
environment. This is interesting given that the leaked Conti documents contain a number of
techniques and advice on AD hunting in the victim environment. The accounts the adversary
leveraged in at least one CTIR engagement also included Administrator and IT accounts,
both of which were emphasized as valuable targets for AD hunting in the leaked playbook.
The adversaries also included instructions on CVE-2020-1472 Zerologon exploitation in
Cobalt Strike. In a previous Ryuk ransomware engagement from Q2 2021, we observed the
adversary access several additional resources within that environment and employ a
privilege escalation exploit leveraging CVE-2020-1472 to impersonate a domain controller.
Talos first started observing Ryuk adversaries using the Zerologon privilege-escalation
vulnerability in September 2020 and continued updating their attacks on the health care and
public health sectors in October. Some researchers have described Conti as the successor
to Ryuk.

Conclusion
7/8

Unfortunately, these ransomware cartels are not going anywhere, and in all likelihood, the
problem will likely get worse before it gets better. These translated playbooks have given
outsiders a glance into the techniques and behaviors of these groups once they are on a
victim network, from the tools they leverage to their capabilities in using OSINT to find
systems of interest on the network. One thing is certain: They clearly provide comprehensive
documentation to their affiliates.
This documentation allows both seasoned criminals and those newer to the scene the ability
to conduct large-scale, damaging campaigns. This shows that although some of the
techniques used by these groups are sophisticated, the adversaries carrying out the actual
attacks may not necessarily be advanced.
Additionally, this translation will provide defenders with a more complete view into the TTPs
of these actors. This is an opportunity for defenders to make sure they have logic in place to
detect these types of behaviors or compensating controls to help mitigate the risk. This
translation should be viewed as an opportunity for defenders to get a better handle on how
these groups operate and the tools they tend to leverage in these attacks.
