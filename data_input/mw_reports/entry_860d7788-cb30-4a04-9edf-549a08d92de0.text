LockBit affiliates using servers to spread ransomware throughout
networks.
Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software, has observed threat actors targeting server
machines in order to spread the LockBit ransomware threat throughout compromised
networks.

1/11

In one attack observed by Symantec, LockBit was seen identifying domain-related
information, creating a Group Policy for lateral movement, and executing a "gpupdate /force"
command on all systems within the same domain, which forcefully updates group policy.

LockBit
LockBit is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operated by malicious actors Symantec tracks
as Syrphid.
Shortly after it first appeared in September 2019, the Syrphid gang expanded its operations,
using a network of affiliates to deploy the LockBit ransomware on victim networks. The
ransomware, which has currently reached version 3.0, has evolved over the past few years,
as has its operators who have recently launched a bug bounty program in order to weed out
weaknesses in the malware’s code and the RaaS operation as a whole.

Attack chain
In one observed instance, before dropping and executing the LockBit ransomware, an
attacker had RDP access to the enterprise network for a couple of weeks at least. This
access may have been obtained through remote desktop applications such as AnyDesk or
Windows RDP, or by exploiting a known vulnerability, etc.
LockBit behaves differently on server machines with domain controllers than on Windows 10
machines. When executed on a server, it has the capability to spread through the network
using Group Policy. On Windows 10 machines it performs routine ransomware activity and
encrypts files.
When LockBit is executed on a server machine it carries out the following actions:
1. Debugger check
LockBit first checks if the malware process is being debugged. If this is the case, it
goes into an infinite loop.

2. Language Check
It calls GetSystemDefaultUILanguage and GetUserDefaultUILanguage to check the
language.
If the language matches with the one on the malware’s list then it terminates
immediately.
LockBit does not target Russia or a selection of nearby countries.

check the language.
3. End running processes and disable services
LockBit ends a list of running processes related to malware analysis and other
processes like Process Explorer, Process Monitor, Wireshark, Dumpcap, Process
Hacker, cmd.exe, TeamViewer, Notepad, Notepad++, WordPad etc.
Disables a list of services related to SQL, backup, and MSExchange etc.
4. Privilege escalation
Duplicates the token by calling DuplicateTokenEx and creates a new process using
CreateProcessAsUserW.
After it achieves privilege escalation, LockBit relaunches itself under DLLHost.exe.
Once the new process is spawned, the LockBit process ends itself.
5. Bypass UAC
LockBit injects code into dllhost.exe with CLSIDs of COM objects, which runs the
following command to bypass UAC:
A. Exploiting USERENV.dll to bypass UAC

C. Exploiting the ICMLuaUtil elevated COM Interface-Object
6. LockBit creates a copy of itself under the SYSVOL directory
“c:\windows\sysvol\domain\scripts\< Lockbit executable>”
7. Creating a Group Policy:
Once the malware identifies it is running as an admin user and a domain controller is
installed on the system, it creates a Group Policy to stop services, end processes, and
copy LockBit etc.
Under the “C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\<policy GUID>” folder, LockBit
creates XML files that are required for the Group Policy.
Computer configurations:
It first creates a policy to turn off Windows Defender, suppress all notifications, disable
file submissions, turn off real-time protection etc.
It then maps the network drive through Group Policy.
Disables services related to SQL server at startup.
User Configurations:
The malware copied the ransomware from SYSVOL to the Desktop directory.
It then creates a scheduled task to end the list of processes previously mentioned.

8. Lateral movement:
LockBit launches powershell.exe to run the command shown below in order to search
through all the computers on the Active Directory. For each host it uses the GPUpdate
force command (gpupdate) to apply the newly created Group Policy.
9. Executes gpupdate command on the domain controller where LockBit is running. Also
runs gpupdate to run policies from the computer configurations and user configurations.
10. Firewall
LockBit reads firewall rules using the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced
Security API's “FwPolicy2” object. The following CLSID COM object is called:

LockBit attempts to delete shadow copies using VSSADMIN and WMIC. It also tries to
disable recovery using the BCDEdit command.
