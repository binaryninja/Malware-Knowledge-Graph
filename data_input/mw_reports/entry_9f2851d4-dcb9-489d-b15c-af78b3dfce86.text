Operation Dream Job

Operation Dream Job's Campaign to
Victimize Job Seekers in Korea
The attack against job seekers in the aerospace and defense industry was first discovered
in 2019. This attack was dubbed ‘Operation Dream Job.’ The attacker disguised as recruiters
from well-known aerospace and defense companies and exploited business-related SNS
accounts to carry out the attacks. Using these accounts, the attackers lured job seekers
with job-related posts. Numerous security vendors have published analysis reports
regarding this attack under different names. Despite the differences in the reported
attack methods and malware strains, the published reports collectively mentioned the
connection between the attack and the North-Korean hacking group, ‘Lazarus.’
In January 2021, JPCERT revealed two major malware strains utilized in attacks related
to Operation Dream Job: Torisma is a malware that was revealed in November 2020, and
Lcpdot is a malware that was recently introduced. AhnLab found out that three variants of
Lcpdot were signed with the ‘2 TOY GUYS LLC’ certificate and decided to analyze the files
signed with the certificate. As a result, variants of Lcpdot malware and other malware were
discovered.
In this report, AhnLab Security Emergency-response Center (ASEC) will examine the
Lcpdot variants used in Operation Dream Job attack while also going over the attack
methods that used malware signed with ‘2 TOY GUYS LLC’ certificate.

1. Analysis of Operation Dream Job
1) Characteristics and Connections
According to numerous security providers and relevant organizations, Lazarus group
has been continuously attacking the aerospace and defense industries with malicious
documents related to employment. These attacks go by various operation names,
but ‘Operation Dream Job’ is most common. Kaspersky categorizes this activity as the
DeathNote cluster of Lazarus group, but the connections are yet to be confirmed. Figure 1
shows the associated operations of Operation Dream Job.

Figure 1. Associated Operation of Operation Dream Job

On July 29, 2020, McAfee revealed that Lazarus group attacked employees in defense
industries in countries like the U.S. through Operation North Star . They also stated that the
attack was related to attacks that occurred in 2017 and 2019.
On August 13, 2020, security provider Clearsky revealed 'Operation Dream Job' that used
fake documents related to defense industry recruitment, targeting Israeli defense workers.
According to this report, Operation Dream Job is related to 'Operation Sharpshooter,'
which McAfee revealed in December 2018, ‘Operation Interception' which was an attack
campaign against European and Middle Eastern aerospace and defense companies,

Report 102

revealed by ESET in June 2020, and McAfee's 'Operation North Star.’
On November 5, 2020, McAfee revealed additional information about Operation North Star
and confirmed attacks against Australian, Israeli, and Russian IP addresses through C&C
server log analysis. Details of Torisma malware analysis were also revealed in the report,
but IOC information of the relevant file was not revealed.
On January 26, 2021, JPCERT published 'Operation Dream Job by Lazarus' in their blog.
Operation Dream Job is a targeted attack that took place between July and August
2020. On August 13, 2020, Clearsky revealed that the attack targeted aerospace and
defense personnel under the disguise of recruitment documents. The article stated that
the operation title was the same, and the attacker is believed to be the Lazarus group.
Although Clearsky did not mention the attack's connection to Operation Dream Job, the
article contained information about Torisma malware, mentioned in ‘Operation North Star:
Behind The Scenes,’ an article published by McAfee in November 2020. It also included
information on Lcpdot malware, the new malware variant.
In January 2021, Google revealed an attack was attempted on their security research, and
the C&C server used in the attack was identical to the C&C server that JPCERT had revealed.
An additional malware strain connected to the same C&C server was found among the
malware strains signed with the certificate associated with other attacks. Some malware
strains were identified to be active in APAC region, and it is believed that activities related
to these malware strains will be continually discovered in all regions.
2) Attack Method
The attack method of Operation Dream Job is not yet fully explained. However, attack
cases detailed in other reports suggest a standard method. It involves developing trust
with the victim through conversation via social networking services, such as LinkedIn,

Report 102

while impersonating a corporate human resource manager. Then, the attacker will send
malware disguised as an employment document.
3) Key Malware Strains
The two key malware strains of Operation Dream Job revealed by JPCERT are Torisma and
Lcpdot.
(1) Torisma
Torisma was first introduced in the article: 'Operation North Star Behind,' published by
McAfee in November 2020. Torisma malware is executed via a Word document that
includes a malicious macro and is usually packed with Themida.
Torisma downloads and executes an additional module from the external server and
performs additional functions, including sending information of the corrupted host and
executing certain files.
(2) Lcpdot
Lcpdot was not mentioned in McAfee's analysis, but it is a malware that was newly
revealed by JPCERT and is also referred to as CookieTime. JPCERT did not reveal the
precise connection between Torisma and Lcpdot, but it is assumed that the malware was
discovered while investigating security breach cases in Japan.
Lcpdot is a downloader similar to Torisma, and some of the samples are protected with
VMProtect packer. It receives the RC4 encryption key and base64-encoded C&C server info
as an argument.
It also uses the Steganography technique to disguise data as GIF files and communicate.
ASEC could not confirm the features of the additionally downloaded module during the
analysis. Thus details of its additional features remain unconfirmed.

All three Lcpdot malware variants were digitally signed with the '2 TOY GUYS LLC'
certificate. Figure 2 shows information on the digital signature that was signed in the file.

4) Additional Activities
Since Lcpdot malware files are collectively signed with an identical digital certificate, ASEC
analyzed the files signed with the certificate, investigated variants of the malware, and
confirmed additional attack cases. Table 1 shows major attack cases between 2020 and 2021.

Table 2. Files Signed with the Certificate

Information about key malware is as follows.
1) March 2020 - ntuser.exe
This malware was first collected on March 6, 2020, and the name of the file is ntuser.exe.
(md5: 06adca7a28b6d1d983912f7f544ee413) It was collected in Korea, and the fact that
the C&C server address contains a Korean website suggests that Korea is the attack target.
Analysis of the malware executed from memory, in Figure 3, revealed that the main body
is encrypted.

Figure 3. Malware that is Executed in the Memory

When malware is executed, it is decrypted and executed in the memory. The code
executed in the memory (md5: 195565729c1bc9d18197e1579431824d) is a malware
variant of Lcpdot, and the file creation date is February 26, 2020. The sample that JPCERT
revealed is believed to be developed around fall 2020 and is a version that is older than
the one found in South Korea.
Afterward, it gives an encryption key as an argument to run Lcpdot, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Encryption Key is Sent as Argument

Figure 5 shows strings such as ‘Cookie=Enable&CookieV=%d&Cookie_Time=32’, a string
unique to Lcpdot.

Note that there are two websites related to ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. It
is unconfirmed whether the server of the developer or the company that operates the ERP
system was infiltrated.
2) March 2020 - citrixvesystem_laptop.exe
The malware collected on March 27, 2020 (md5: 5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) is
disguised as Citrix Workspace program. Figure 8 is the screenshot of the file attributes.

Figure 8. Information of citrixvessystem_laptop.exe File

Citrix Workspace is a digital workspace solution that helps users access company
applications and data from a single, central platform. It's a tool that allows users to access
the web app, company data, file virtual applications, and desktop.
When malware is executed, it attempts to download the file from an industrial supply mall
(hxxps://www.to****9.com/common/Download.asp?id=293). During testing, ‘Update Data.
db' file with the size of 0 bytes was downloaded.
It was confirmed that the normal Citrix Workspace file was included in the resource
(Resource IDR_CITRIXAPP) area, and it was executed after being created.

4) November 2020 - d3d10.dll
The malware that was found in November 2020 is known as ComeBacker. The C&C server
of this sample (dm5: ec0c8d2cb8da72f4b82ebe3c33c9f24f ) has an identical URL to www.
fabioluciani.com , a URL of Figure 10. This URL also happens to be the C&C server of the
attack against Google security researchers in January 2021, revealed by Google.

Figure 10. C&C server identical to other campaigns of Lazarus group

Among the targets of the attack directed to security researchers, Korean security provider
Enki revealed information regarding the attack that was launched against them and the
Zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-26411) that affected the Internet Explorer . A security patch
was later issued on March 9, 2021. The identical certificate and C&C server address suggest
that Operation Dream Job and the attack on security researchers are highly related.
5) January 2021 - igfxaudio.exe
igfxaudio.exe file (md5: 22cb24a51394e3ab9b161cd2f6de234f ) that was collected from
Oman in January 2021 has a size of 4,073,592 bytes, and is packed.

3. Malware Attributions
Figure 11 shows the overview of connections between malware strains and attack
methods related to Operation Dream Job.

Figure 11. Malware Attributions

It is believed that Lcpdot malware revealed by JPCERT was discovered along with Torisma
malware. There are some cases where Lcpdot malware is signed with a specific certificate,
and AhnLab managed to find a variant of Lcpdot and additional malware after analyzing
the files signed with the certificate.
Upon analysis, it was found that since spring 2020, the attacker has been using Lcpdot
type malware to attack various countries, including Korea. It is assumed that the malware
normally connects to 3-4 websites and uses different C&C server address for each attack
target, based on the region and the language. For example, malware found in Korea all
takes a form of a Korean website, and the same goes for Japan, where all malware found
takes the form of websites that exist in Japan. Furthermore, one of the malware signed
with 2 TOY GUYS LLC certificate has the same C&C server address as the one revealed by
Google in 2021 (www.fabioluciani.com).

Report 102

Some statements regarding the malware attribution made by various security providers
have little to no evidence backing up their statement. Thus, security vendors, such as
Clearsky, stated that Operation Sharpshooter and Operation Interception might be
‘somewhat’ associated to Operation Dream Job.
Furthermore, Torisma that JPCERT revealed may seem like it is linked to McAfee's Torisma,
but this cannot be confirmed as McAfee did not reveal the specifics regarding the IOC.
Additionally, JPCERT revealed Lcpdot but did not reveal its exact connection to Torisma
malware. Still, Kaspersky claimed that they confirmed Lcpdot malware's access to the C&C
server, which was used by malware of the Lazarus group.
Categorizing this group of malware into a specific group is challenging and risky when
attack vectors, attack methods, and malware can only be identified in a limited fashion.
This report also does not attempt to claim that there is a definite link between the malware
strains and the Lazarus group. However, AhnLab hopes that this report can help track
related groups via information about Lcpdot variants and other malware that are assumed
to be linked.
4. Overview of AhnLab Response
AhnLab's solutions detect and block the malware related to Operation Dream Job using
the following aliases:

Trojan/Win32.Lcpdot (2021.02.09.00)
Trojan/Win32.Pretendapp (2021.02.09.00)
Trojan/Win64.Nukesped (2021.02.01.01)
Trojan/Win32.NukeSped (2021.02.02.02)
Trojan/Win64.Manuscrypt (2021.02.02.02)
Trojan/Win32.Lcpdot (2021.02.26.04)

Report 102

Activities of Operation Dream Job and Lazarus attack group were revealed recently, but
AhnLab solutions have been detecting them with the aliases stated above. Please note
that some malware may not have been detected as they were not confirmed to be related
to this attack during the analysis phase.
5. Conclusion
Lazarus group is one of the attack groups that have been maintaining high level of
activity since 2020, and many analysts are tracking and performing analysis on the
group. The attack group of Operation Dream Job, assumed to be the Lazarus group, has
been attacking aerospace and defense companies since 2019 under disguise. However,
considering its connection with other attacks, there is a probability that the group may
have launched attacks on other industries as well. Furthermore, multiple group activities
have been detected, although their connections are yet to be confirmed. ASEC will
continue to track the group and the attacks regarding Operation Dream Jobs until further
discoveries are made.
