The State of Security in Control Systems Today

A SANS Survey

Executive Summary
Industrial control systems (ICS), or the hardware and software that monitor and control
physical equipment and processes for critical infrastructure, such as water, oil, gas,
energy and utilities, as well as automated manufacturing, pharmaceutical processing
and defense networks, present a wildly attractive target for those who seek to cause
disruption or to threaten infrastructure for their own purposes. Because of the significant
costs of designing, developing and optimizing control systems, those

referred to in different industries as supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, process control
systems (PCS), process control domains (PCD), or building
automation and control systems (BACS)

seeking to gain technical data for their own use also target them.
SANS recognized the growing concerns about attacks on this sector
with the appearance of Stuxnet and began developing an ICS securityspecific practice, including a growing selection of educational offerings
and an annual survey of professionals working or active in industrial
control systems.1 Since our first ICS security survey, we have seen such

disturbing events as the 2014 German

Executive Summary (CONTINUED)
While control system networks are not necessarily more opaque than IT systems, the
available tools to map and monitor their traffic and attached devices have been less
robust than their IT counterparts. It is essential that industry leaders provide their
security practitioners with the tools, training and resources to gain the insight needed to
protect these critical assets.
Threat vectors do vary, but the top vector consists of external actors

Survey Participants
The 314 respondents who actively maintain, operate or provide consulting services to
facilities maintaining industrial control systems, energy and utilities (29%), together with
related oil and gas production or delivery (5%), far outweigh other industry segments.
The “Other” category accounted for 21% and consisted of a mix of respondents
providing business and government services to this industry. And 13% of respondents
came from business services. Only engineering services and control system equipment
manufacturers accounted for 5% of our sample. All other sectors were represented by
less than 4% of the respondents.
Of the respondents, 70% work in companies of more than 1,000 employees, and 28%
work in companies with more than 15,000 employees. These numbers indicate that
industrialized processes and their support services are typically provided by larger
enterprises.
While respondents’ organizations primarily operate or support control systems in the
United States, we observed an increase in the number of respondents’ employers
outside the U.S., rising from 16% in 2014 to 22% in this survey, with increases fairly
evenly distributed across all regions of the world. Table 1 provides a look at the
international reach of respondents’ organizations.

positive trend, given that these individuals have a perspective on operational concerns
that generally differs from that of the administrative group.

Control System Security Training
It is clear from our results that most of our respondents hold security certifications, but
the largest number of these (52%) is not specific to control systems, such as the CISSP,5
CISA6 or CompTIA. Less than half (43%) have completed the GICSP,7 and even fewer the
ISA99/IEC8 (13%) or IACRB9 (12%). IT security education is valuable, particularly with the
converging technology trends, but it does not translate directly to ICS environments.
We highly recommend that everyone working with the security of control systems and
their networks be trained in ICS-specific considerations. See Appendix A, “ICS Security
Training,” for additional information.

The State of Security in Control Systems Today

Security Threats and Drivers
Survey respondents indicated that their primary business concern regarding the security
of control systems was ensuring the reliability and availability of control systems (35%).
This was followed by ensuring the health and safety of employees—a distant second at
15%. The third most-pressing concern was lowering of risk/improving security at 13%.
These same concerns fall in the top four overall concerns:
• Ensuring reliability and availability: 68%
• Lowering risk/improving security: 40%
• Preventing damage: 28%
• Ensuring health and safety: 27%
Control system reliability and availability are often considered in conflict with efforts
to secure those systems, and this issue has gained attention recently. The increasing
utilization of IP-based technologies in control system environments has brought with
it well-known security concerns. Unfortunately, the methods and tools long in use in IT
can be highly disruptive in the ICS space. The need for nondisruptive methods to secure
control systems, without awaiting the infrequent shutdowns of these systems, is leading
to new products and solutions. See Figure 2 for a ranking of business concerns.

Security Threats and Drivers (CONTINUED)
The fifth most highly rated concern, protecting external people and property, fell from
the top position (21%) in our previous survey to 10% in just one year. It is unclear what
this means. There is clearly a shift in either the attitudes of our respondents or in their
perceptions of the attitudes of their companies.

Risk Perception
General-purpose computing assets (human–machine interface [HMI], server,
workstations) running commercial OSes are considered to be at greatest risk of
compromise by 44% of respondents. Penetration and assessment teams often find
routes into control system networks through corporate IT, so it is not surprising that the
runner-up, chosen by 14% as their primary concern, is connection of office networks to
the internal systems.
Although exploit kits targeting industrial control systems have begun to proliferate,
penetration testers know their fastest route onto an ICS network is often through
connected business systems. See Figure 3.
Which control system components do you consider at greatest risk for compromise?
Rank the top three, with “1” indicating the component at greatest risk.

The State of Security in Control Systems Today

Security Threats and Drivers (CONTINUED)
Survey respondents indicate that the focus remains on securing IT devices and
applications, rather than on the industrial control system components themselves.
The relative maturity of security tools and practices for general-purpose computers
and commercial operating systems may be contributing to the greater attention they
receive. Options for securing ICS systems and networks are newer and less tested. Still,
technologies such as security information and event management (SIEM) solutions
and passive network anomaly detection systems, enabling greater insight into control
system networks with decreased risk of operational disruptions, have begun to grow in
number and establish their safety and reliability.

TAKEAWAY:

Recognizing that decision influencers often deal more closely with the details of
operations, we refined our survey from last year. In addition to asking for the respondents’
perceptions, we added a question to learn how decision makers and decision influencers
perceived the threat. Figure 4 compares these two groups’ perceptions.

Decision Influencers

Figure 4. Threat Perceptions

Our respondents believe decision makers’ concern with cybersecurity threats has
decreased over the past year, with significant percentages moving from the highest to
more moderate levels of concern. This change may be due to advances in organizational
security programs providing better situational awareness and protection. Respondents’
answers, however, indicate decision influencers are notably more concerned than
decision makers, with relatively higher numbers rating their perception of threat as High
or Severe, perhaps attesting to their being closer to the problem and playing a more
hands-on role in threat mitigation.

Incident Detection
A clear year-over-year trend emerged in respondents’ answers to our question about
recent control system infiltration. It appears that more breaches are occurring, with 9%
of respondents acknowledging six or more breaches in 2014, and 17% noting six or
more breaches in 2015. More organizations also acknowledge the possibility of breaches
taking place without their knowledge.
Interestingly, due to company policy, 24% were unable to answer whether they’d been

Another third reported experiencing more than two breaches within the past year, and
the group who believed their systems had been infiltrated six to 10 times in that period
more than tripled, increasing from 3% in 2014 to 11% in 2015. This is a dramatic increase
and supports the widely reported increasing frequency of attacks on control systems.11

network or system noise so as not to be noticed.
Rapid detection is key because the longer breaches remain unknown, the greater the
potential impact. Due to the critical nature of many control systems, the documented
rise in attacks on these systems12 and the potential impact of even brief operational
disruptions, we investigated the time to detection.

Figure 7. Time to Detection

Various industry reports show that security breaches often go undetected for great
lengths of time, even exceeding our greatest answer option by multiples. Such lengthy
times to detection provide more than enough time for attackers to complete their
reconnaissance and install any illicit monitoring, reporting or disrupting malware.
Greater amounts of time also allow attackers to remove the traces that would otherwise
provide forensic investigators with the clues necessary to identify them, their actions
and purposes. So it comes as no surprise that 44% never identified where the infiltrations
or infections took place. Either attackers covered their tracks or the investigations carried
out were not sufficient to find them.

Nearly every other category shrank, with the exception of industrial espionage and

This supports the impression that the Sony attack14 has had a significant impact on the
public mind, given that it was generally characterized as an extortive situation.
Phishing Scams
A note of concern: Phishing scams fell even lower this year as a concern
of respondents despite a growing body of evidence that this key
weakness is frequently exploited by attackers.15 Underestimating the
importance of protecting against phishing is the equivalent of not
requiring background checks on security personnel. “For two years,
more than two-thirds of incidents that comprise the Cyber-Espionage
pattern have featured phishing. The user interaction is not about eliciting
information, but for attackers to establish persistence on user devices,
set up camp, and continue their stealthy march inside the network.”16

SANS ANALYST PROGRAM

The integration of IT into control system networks, a
new option chosen by 19% of respondents as the single
greatest threat vector, was ranked in the top three by 46%.
Those working in this field have long been aware of risks
inherent to the introduction of IP-based technology and
general-purpose computing devices into control systems.
Acceleration of the trend in recent years has increased levels
of concern. Awareness of the issues continues to grow, as
does IT’s level of penetration.

Looking specifically at initiatives intended to increase ICS security, the clear leaders are
performing security assessment/audit of control systems and control system networks,
chosen by 49%, and security awareness training (41%). They are followed closely by
increasing physical security to control access (27%). It is possible that incidents such as

of security technologies by their ICS equipment vendors is mandatory, and even more
concerning that 25% said it is only moderately important or not important. And 10%

Figure 11. Patching and Updating Assets

We must stress here that failure to conduct regular and frequent patching is a
tremendously risky posture. Numerous industry reports identify outdated patches as
one of the largest and most commonly exploited points of vulnerability in both IT and
control systems. A minimal patch management program must at least provide security
practitioners an awareness of what software and systems are out of date so they can
monitor for and protect against relevant exploits. For additional information, read

Once again, OLE for Process Control (OPC) was rated as the least frequently monitored
asset—even though it often provides communications between control systems and
corporate networks. We noted last year that this role and lack of oversight makes OPC a
highly attractive target for attackers seeking a point to pivot from business to operations
networks—and it appears this remains true.

supply and high demand, and very few operating companies have them on staff, which
calls the value of the efforts of these internal teams into question.

Many respondents are following some recommended practices to detect threats aimed

from security vendors, 44% work with governmental agencies and 45% participate in
industry information-sharing groups. Although all of these methods are valuable and
complementary, they are not all in use by the same companies. As noted previously, a

Security Controls and Methodologies (CONTINUED)
Security Policy
Most (86%) respondents identified the individuals with responsibility for control system
security policy as titled officers, including chief security officer, CIO, chief information
security officer, information security officer and CEO. For 8% of respondents, no single
individual set policy; rather, policy was set by committees, teams and boards. The
evolving nature of the control system security landscape and the unique characteristics
of each operation certainly appear to contribute to the diversity of models in use.
IT and control system networks are still very different environments,23 and a strong working
knowledge of both is required to set and implement successful policies. We consider
the involvement of cross-functional teams a positive indication that organizations are
working to ensure inclusion of all aspects of the systems and networks involved.

Security Controls
To gain deeper insight into security responsibility, we also studied who implements
the subsequent controls. It is no surprise to see that for 56% of respondents the asset
owners/operators are chiefly responsible, with 40% tapping engineering management
(see Figure 15).

This growth, however small, is a positive trend. The question of who should bear the
cost of increased security can be a contentious one, with both vendors and customers
presenting business cases placing the burden on the opposite party. Whether operations
or market share is at risk, everyone has a stake in preventing security breaches. We hope
to see increasing consideration of cybersecurity in procurement processes drive greater
efforts to include security from initial product design through disposal.

IT-ICS Convergence
Ongoing issues arising from the continuing integration of commercial operating
systems (Windows, Linux, UNIX) and open communication protocols into control system
networks encouraged us to study how participants are dealing with this convergence of
technologies.
Considering the magnitude of the changes that drive the trend,24 we wondered if
participants have a plan as general-purpose devices and IP-based technologies continue
to grow within control and automation system environments. The majority (83%)
recognize the importance of having a security strategy to address the convergence
of information and operational technologies. Unfortunately, only 47% actually have a
strategy, as shown in Figure 18.

Figure 18. Strategies for IT-ICS Convergence

The changes associated with IT-ICS convergence have been ongoing,25 and many are
both fundamental and far-reaching in effect.26 Although the unique considerations
of each enterprise prevent the creation of a universal road map to deal with these
changes, much guidance does exist on approaches to the problem. A simple Google
search identifies many sources on the subject. It is clear the most serious mistake
an organization could make would be not taking on the challenge of managing this
convergence with a plan.
The survey also examined the collaboration between IT and control systems operations
groups. The majority (70%) of our respondents noted a moderate level of such
collaboration. We hope that the remaining 30% have acquired or developed the
requisite knowledge and skills within their operations environments. On the positive
side, 73% of respondents indicate a trend toward increased collaboration.

It is encouraging that 47% of respondents noted they had some insight into the budget.
We consider that positive because it indicates that those in the trenches are at least
partially involved in the budgeting process, likely including participation in setting
priorities. Unfortunately, that leaves another 53% of respondents with no knowledge
of the budgets. Figure 20 illustrates what we know about the control system security

The State of Security in Control Systems Today

Conclusions
Multiple factors drive the increased targeting of control systems. Connections within
and across network boundaries continue to grow at an accelerating rate, opening new
points of exposure. The introduction of IP-based technology and general-purpose
computing devices into operational environments is introducing new vulnerabilities
along with their benefits. At the same time, the sophistication, capabilities, motivations
and numbers of threat actors are also increasing.
To succeed at protecting these environments, control system and information security
professionals need sufficient training, tools and support—not only so they can respond
to ongoing attacks, but also so they can proactively identify and implement safeguards
to prevent future ones. Yet, the survey suggests necessary resources may be lacking in
many organizations. Rectifying this problem requires increasing cybersecurity budgets.
We believe it essential that business leaders provide security practitioners with the
tools, training and resources to gain the knowledge and insight needed to protect these
critical assets.
Another challenge highlighted in the survey, a lack of visibility into control system
equipment and network activity, continues to inhibit progress in securing assets and
decreases confidence in the accuracy of self-evaluations of vulnerability levels and the
number of breaches experienced.
The results are not all negative. On the positive side, we see collaboration between IT
and control systems personnel on the rise, although there is much room for additional
improvement. Similarly, products and services to improve insight are increasing in
response to the need. We consider this crucial because vendors must also take an active
role in developing solutions. No single party can solve all the problems that have grown
in and around this space.
It is SANS’ hope that the entities with the most to lose, particularly the organizations
built on the dependency and reliability of their control systems, will recognize the
rising level of risk and focus their resources on addressing the serious threats to their
continued operations. For our part, we will continue our mission to support them in
their efforts.
