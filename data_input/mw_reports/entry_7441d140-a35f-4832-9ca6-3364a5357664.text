Momentum Botnet's Newest DDoS Attacks and IoT Exploits

December 16, 2019

We recently found notable malware activity affecting devices running Linux, a platform that has battled numerous issues just this year. Further
analysis of retrieved malware samples revealed that these actions were connected to a botnet called Momentum (named for the image found
in its communication channel). We found new details on the tools and techniques the botnet is currently using to compromise devices and
perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
Momentum targets the Linux platform on various CPU architectures such as ARM, MIPS, Intel, Motorola 68020, and more. The main purpose
of this malware is to open a backdoor and accept commands to conduct various types of DoS attacks against a given target. The backdoors
being distributed by the Momentum botnet are Mirai, Kaiten, and Bashlite variants; the specific sample we analyzed was pushing a Mirai
backdoor. Moreover, Momentum spreads via exploiting multiple vulnerabilities on various routers and web services to download and execute
shell scripts on the target devices.
How does Momentum work?
After infecting a device, Momentum attempts to achieve persistence by modifying the “rc” files; then it joins the command and control (C&C)
server and connects to an internet relay chat (IRC) channel called #HellRoom to register itself and accept commands. The IRC protocol is the
main method of communication with the command and control (C&C) servers. The botnet operators can then control infected systems by
sending messages to the IRC channel.

The distribution server (as seen above) hosts the malware executables. The other server is a C&C server for the botnet. The C&C servers
were live as recently as November 18 2019.
Once the communication lines are established, Momentum can use various commands to attack using the compromised devices. In particular,
Momentum can deploy 36 different methods for DoS, as listed below.

Table 1. Various DoS methods that Momentum is capable of
The malware uses known reflection and amplifications methods that have a variety of targets: MEMCACHE, LDAP, DNS and Valve Source
Engine. In these types of attack, the malware typically spoofs source IP addresses (the victims) to various services run on publicly accessible
servers, provoking a flood of responses to overwhelm the victim’s address.
Apart from DoS attacks, we found that Momentum is also capable of other actions: opening a proxy on a port on a specified IP, changing the
nick of the client, disabling or enabling packeting from the client, and more. In the section below we will run through the specific attack
capabilities of Momentum:
Momentum’s denial-of-service attacks
LDAP DDoS reflection
In a LDAP DDoS reflection, the malware spoofed the source IP address of a target system to publicly accessible LDAP servers which causes it
to send a larger response to the target.
Memcache attack I
In a Memcache attack, a remote attacker constructs and sends a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system
to a vulnerable UDP memcached server. The memcached server then sends a significantly large response to the target. Momentum uses an
HTTP GET request to download a reflection file—the malware uses the same request for the same purpose in other amplified DoS attacks as
well.
Based on initial data from Shodan, there are over 42,000 vulnerable memcached servers that can be affected by this type of attack.
The Momentum botnet uses the following HTTP GET request to download reflection file:
GET / HTTP/1.1

3/7

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.75 [en] (X11; U; Linux 2.2.16-3 i686)
Host: <HOST_Address>:80
Accept: */*
Connection: Keep-Alive
UDP-BYPASS attack
In a UDP-BYPASS attack, Momentum floods the target host by constructing and unloading a legitimate UDP payload on a specific port. Upon
execution of this attack the malware chooses a random port and a corresponding payload, then sends it against the targeted host. The
malware uses multi-threading for this attack; each thread takes a port followed by its payload.
The following is list of some ports followed by their payload:

Table 2. Ports and their payloads
Most of the scripts seen above are used for service discovery. If they are sent to the target device over a long period of time, denial-of-service
may be achieved because they crash a service as a side effect of testing.
Phatwonk attacks
Phatwonk attacks perform multiple DoS methods at once: XMAS, all flags at once, usyn (urg syn), and any TCP flag combination.
Momentum’s other capabilities
Fruitful attacks are also dependent on other capabilities than outright offense. Usually malware attempt to evade detection, maintain open
avenues of communication, and more for a sustained successful campaign.
Momentum has other capabilities that help it spread and compromise devices:

4/7

Fast flux. The Momentum botnet uses the fast flux technique in order to make its command and control network more resilient. A fast flux
network means having multiple IP addresses associated with a domain name and then constantly changing them in quick succession—
this is used by attackers to mislead or evade security investigators.
Backdoor. The attacker can send a command (“BASH”, “SHD” or SH commands) to the IRC channel and malware clients will receive and
execute it on an infected system. The result will be sent back to the same IRC channel where the attacker executed it.
Propagate. Momentum propagates by trying to exploit the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. The particular C&C server that we have
been investigating has 1,232 victims shown. For other Momentum variants and C&C servers there may be more.

Security recommendations and solutions
Smart and connected devices are prone compromise because of limited security settings and protection options. The devices themselves are
often manufactured with operation in mind, not security. Users should take proactive steps in securing their devices, particularly routers. As
mentioned above, the Momentum botnet targets Linux devices which are known to be susceptible to attacks involving botnets, ransomware
and cryptocurrency miners. However, there are different ways to protect such devices from attacks.
