Understanding When to Use LDAP or RADIUS
for Centralized Authentication
Ben Herrmann

INTRODUCTION
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
(RADIUS) protocol are two commonly used protocols for authenticating and authorizing users.
Both protocols perform similar tasks, making it hard to determine which to use. This application
note describes the differences between both protocols as well as security considerations for
implementation.

PROBLEM
LDAP and RADIUS are typically used to authenticate and authorize users, but choosing which
protocol to use for certain tasks can be difficult. In addition, setting up these services can be timeconsuming and confusing. The two protocols operate differently, which leads to varying levels of
security and network traffic.

SOLUTION
Understanding the difference between the protocols can help users select the right protocol for the
right task. This application note also provides general security information on SEL
implementations of LDAP and RADIUS. For information about specific applications, contact the
SEL Engineering Services cybersecurity team.

What Is LDAP?
LDAP is a directory service that is used to search and modify directories over a network, such as
those created by Microsoft® Active Directory® service. An LDAP server contains the directory of
users in an LDAP directory tree. LDAP clients who wish to gain information about entries in the
tree or perform modifications to these entries contact the server. These servers can be replicated
to allow for faster, more reliable access to the directory across a network. LDAP servers can store
various user attributes, such as telephone numbers, emails, and locations, as well as
authentication information. This gives network administrators flexibility when implementing
services such as single sign-on.

What Is RADIUS?
RADIUS is a protocol that allows for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting
(AAA) for user and/or network access control. RADIUS clients contact the server with user
credentials as part of a RADIUS Access-Request message, and the server responds back with a
RADIUS Access-Accept, Access-Reject, or Access-Challenge message. Authentication and
authorization are generally performed in one step to minimize traffic flow, although RADIUS can

support multifactor (or two-factor) authentication using one or more Access-Challenge messages.
Accounting is then performed via additional messages from the client to the server. RADIUS also
supports more complex forms of authentication, such as those described by the Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP).

Design Differences
LDAP
LDAP provides a means of interfacing to a directory. LDAP does not require any security
between the client and server. However, through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS),
LDAP can encrypt user sessions between the client and server. This keeps all information
transferred in LDAP transactions over the network secure. LDAP also benefits from a simple
implementation process that is easy for network users to access. However, LDAP does not
directly support user accounting. Many implementations provide server-side accounting that
varies in scope. Other user activity can be captured by additional protocols, such as Syslog. These
additional protocols allow an LDAP server to provide user authentication services. Figure 1
shows a basic LDAP network.

RADIUS
RADIUS typically acts as an intermediate service that only handles AAA. It can contact a
directory service, either its own or that of a different server, and authenticate and authorize the
user. This process alleviates some of the performance issues with large directory structures by
allowing the caching of user data on the RADIUS server. It also allows the server to integrate
with dedicated authentication servers. The RADIUS server talks to other services using other
protocols, such as LDAP or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). This adds considerable
functionality and security but can complicate setup.
RADIUS protocol lacks encryption on all attributes except for the password field, which can be a
cause for concern to network administrators. However, other protocols described later in this
application note can alleviate security issues. RADIUS can also perform accounting services,
ensuring that sensitive user information is properly tracked. Services such as one-time password
(OTP) generation can also be attached to RADIUS servers. These services are supported through
the use of Access-Challenge messages. Figure 2 shows a basic RADIUS network structure.

Operational Differences
LDAP and RADIUS have some small differences in how they operate. This leads to varying
levels of security and network traffic.
LDAP and RADIUS have several differences in how they interact over the network. LDAP uses
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in order to ensure reliable connection across the network.
TCP ensures a connection, but does require more network overhead. RADIUS uses User
Datagram Protocol (UDP), which minimizes network overhead but does not ensure a connection.
Depending on implementation, this may cause lost packets, errors in packets, and lengthy
timeouts. It may also make the network vulnerable to replay attacks if implemented improperly.
By default, RADIUS packets lack encryption, except on the password field, meaning that
sensitive user information is sent in clear text over the network. To combat this, users need to
implement additional security mechanisms, such as a virtual private network, between RADIUS
servers and clients if all RADIUS attributes need to be encrypted. For additional security,
RADIUS is also flexible enough to allow for other forms of authentication, such as those
implemented using EAP.
By itself, LDAP is unable to support multifactor authentication. Several enterprise solutions are
available, but many require additional resources. These solutions often implement other protocols
as well, including RADIUS. RADIUS can support services that query directory services for user
information as well as additional services, such as OTP servers, for enhanced security. For
general security information on SEL implementations of LDAP and RADIUS, see Table 1.

Network resources used by the two protocols are also quite different (see Table 2). LDAP
sessions often require multiple transactions between the server and the client, which can cause
significant delays during user authentication attempts. RADIUS can cache user information from
the directory server to decrease login times. RADIUS is a simpler, less verbose protocol than
LDAP, which increases the speed of authentication transactions for large databases of users.
However, because RADIUS uses UDP, requests may time out and have to be retried if the
network quality is poor. Authentication client load is reduced when using RADIUS because the
network load is minimized and there is no need for complex settings or directory searches to take
place between the user and the directory service.

While RADIUS can offer considerable functionality, it can be difficult to maintain. Managing
multiple backend services can be confusing for network administrators. RADIUS servers often
communicate using multiple protocols, quickly making troubleshooting difficult. LDAP provides
basic network authentication with minimal hardware requirements and a simpler interface. This
can reduce maintenance and overhead costs as well as reduce stress on network administrators.

CONCLUSION
This brief overview of LDAP and RADIUS provides insight into how these protocols are
commonly implemented. RADIUS and LDAP both allow for centralized authentication services.
LDAP can allow for single sign-on services in the network, but it lacks built-in tools for session
accounting. LDAP can easily be encrypted using TLS as a wrapper. The simplicity of LDAP also
allows for easy setup and integration with an already established network, such as a Microsoft
Active Directory server. RADIUS allows for flexibility in services offered because it can connect
to almost any other network service. RADIUS often allows for faster speed in network
transactions due to its simplicity. However, setup of these services can be time-consuming and
confusing. In short, LDAP excels in situations where simple password authentication is needed
while RADIUS offers additional services for authentication but increased complexity during the
setup and management of the network.
