Recently, on the twitter of Shadow Chaser Group, they tweet information about malware
sample that targeting Vietnam.

Cause this sample related to Vietnam, so I decided to taking time to perform a quick analysis
of this malicious document. A quick check of this document shows that it uses the Template
Injection technique. The advantage of this technique is that when the user open the file, it will
automatically download the fav.ico file from the address
hxxp://office[.]oiqezet[.]com/portals/office/fav.ico .

3/10

In addition, based on the <AppVersion> tag information, it is possible to know that the
attacker created this document from Office 2010 :

At the time of analysis, I could still download the fav.ico (MD5:
9521e4138fd0e6996072778cd4f1f06a) file:

The downloaded fav.ico file is not a PE file, it is an RTF file :

Checking it with the rtfobj tool, the results show that this RTF file has an embedded
object named qax23.xp , with size: 167831 bytes, and has MD5 =
‘ 935553d110e5ded158006d0679226641 ‘.

This technique reminds me some of samples that I’ve analyzed before: [1] , [2], [3], [4].
Thanks to nao_sec for updating the rr_decoder tool to decode the encrypted object.

After dumping the object and then use rr_decoder , I got the Dll file with the original name
Download.dll.

6/10

Here is the result when I upload this Dll to tria.ge site: https://tria.ge/220124k8nknsdhf8/behavioral1

As shown in the figure, the malware after executing will send encrypted data to the address
http://office[.]oiqezet[.]com/portals/office/log.php? , whereby the IP address
of remote address is from Vietnam. To be able to decode the above data, I quickly reversed
code of the Dll file.
The code of this Dll shows that it will collect and aggregate information about the victim’s
computer, including: Host Name, OS Name, OS Version, System type, Architecture,
User Name, InternetInformation, Antivirus product .

8/10

All collected information will be encrypted with the RC4 algorithm, with the
encryption/decryption key is "123abc" , then this encrypted data will continue to be
encoded by the Base64 algorithm before being sent to C2 as picture above.

9/10

Based on the analysis results, by using CyberChef, I can decrypt the encrypted data when
sent to C2 as follows:

End.
