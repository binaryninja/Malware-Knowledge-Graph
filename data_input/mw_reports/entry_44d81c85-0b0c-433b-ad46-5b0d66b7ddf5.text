Military Computer Attack Confirmed

WASHINGTON — A top Pentagon official has confirmed a previously classified incident that
he describes as “the most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever,” a 2008 episode
in which a foreign intelligence agent used a flash drive to infect computers, including those
used by the Central Command in overseeing combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Plugging the cigarette-lighter-sized flash drive into an American military laptop at a base in
the Middle East amounted to “a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to
servers under foreign control,” according to William J. Lynn 3d, deputy secretary of defense,
writing in the latest issue of the journal Foreign Affairs.
“It was a network administrator’s worst fear: a rogue program operating silently, poised to
deliver operational plans into the hands of an unknown adversary,” Mr. Lynn wrote.
The incident was first reported in November 2008 by the Danger Room blog of Wired
magazine, and then in greater detail by The Los Angeles Times, which said that the matter
was sufficiently grave that President George W. Bush was briefed on it. The newspaper
mentioned suspicions of Russian involvement.

But Mr. Lynn’s article was the first official confirmation. He also put a name — Operation
Buckshot Yankee — to the Pentagon operation to counter the attack, and said that the
episode “marked a turning point in U.S. cyber-defense strategy.” In an early step, the
Defense Department banned the use of portable flash drives with its computers, though it
later modified the ban.
Mr. Lynn described the extraordinary difficulty of protecting military digital communications
over a web of 15,000 networks and 7 million computing devices in dozens of countries
against farflung adversaries who, with modest means and a reasonable degree of ingenuity,
can inflict outsized damage. Traditional notions of deterrence do not apply.
“A dozen determined computer programmers can, if they find a vulnerability to exploit,
threaten the United States’s global logistics network, steal its operational plans, blind its
intelligence capabilities or hinder its ability to deliver weapons on target,” he wrote.
Security officials also face the problem of counterfeit hardware that may have remotely
operated “kill switches” or “back doors” built in to allow manipulation from afar, as well as the
problem of software with rogue code meant to cause sudden malfunctions.
Against the array of threats, Mr. Lynn said, the National Security Agency had pioneered
systems — “part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter” — that are meant to automatically
counter intrusions in real time.
His article appeared intended partly to raise awareness of the threat to United States
cybersecurity — “the frequency and sophistication of intrusions into U.S. military networks
have increased exponentially,” he wrote — and partly to make the case for a larger Pentagon
role in cyberdefense.
Various efforts at cyberdefense by the military have been drawn under a single organization,
the U.S. Cyber Command, which began operations in late May at Fort Meade, Maryland,
under a four-star general, Keith B. Alexander.
But under proposed legislation, the Department of Homeland Security would take the leading
role in the defense of civilian systems.
Though the Cyber Command has greater capabilities, the military operates within the United
States only if ordered to do so by the president.
Another concern is whether the Pentagon, or government in general, has the nimbleness for
such work. Mr. Lynn acknowledged that “it takes the Pentagon 81 months to make a new
computer system operational after it is first funded.” By contrast, he noted, “the iPhone was
developed in 24 months.”
