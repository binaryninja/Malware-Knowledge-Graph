ESET research uncovers a cyberespionage operation targeting Venezuelan government
institutions

1/11

Latin America is often overlooked when it comes to persistent threats and groups with
politically motivated targets. There is, however, an ongoing case of cyberespionage against
high-profile organizations that has managed to stay under the radar. The group behind
these attacks has stolen gigabytes of confidential documents, mostly from Venezuelan
government organizations. It is still very active at the time of this publication, regularly
introducing changes to its malware, infrastructure and spearphishing campaigns.
ESET has been tracking a new version of Machete (the group’s Python-based toolset) that
was first seen in April 2018. While the main functionality of the backdoor remains the same
as in previous versions, it has been extended with new features over the course of a year.

Targets
From the end of March up until the end of May 2019, ESET researchers observed that there
were more than 50 victimized computers actively communicating with the C&C server. This
amounts to gigabytes of data being uploaded every week. More than 75% of the
compromised computers were part of Venezuelan government organizations, including the
military forces, education, police, and foreign affairs sectors. This extends to other countries
in Latin America, with the Ecuadorean military being another organization highly targeted
with the Machete malware. The distribution of this malware in these countries is shown in
Figure 1.

Malware operators
Machete’s operators use effective spearphishing techniques. Their long run of attacks,
focused on Latin American countries, has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine
their tactics over the years. They know their targets, how to blend into regular
communications, and which documents are of the most value to steal. Not only does
Machete exfiltrate common office suite documents, but also specialized file types used by
geographic information systems (GIS) software. The group is interested in files that
describe navigation routes and positioning using military grids.
The Machete group sends very specific emails directly to its victims, and these change from
target to target. These emails contain either a link to, or an attachment of, a compressed
self-extracting archive that runs the malware and opens a document that serves as a decoy.
Figure 2 is a typical PDF file displayed to a potential victim during compromise. To trick
unsuspecting targets, Machete operators use real documents they have previously stolen;
Figure 2 is a classified official document that is dated May 21st, 2019, the same day the

3/11

related .zip file was first sent to targets. ESET has seen more cases like this where stolen
documents dated on one particular day were bundled with malware and used on the same
day as lures to compromise new victims.

Figure 2. Decoy (PDF file) in one of the Machete downloaders (blurred)

The kind of documents used as decoys are sent and received legitimately several times a
day by the group’s targets. For example, Radiogramas are documents used for
communication in the Venezuelan military forces. Attackers take advantage of that, along
with their knowledge of military jargon and etiquette, to craft very convincing phishing
emails.

Main characteristics
The Machete group is very active and has introduced several changes to its malware since
a new version was released in April 2018. Previous versions were described by Kaspersky
in 2014 and Cylance in 2017. In Figure 3 we show the components for the new version of
the Machete malware.

Figure 3. Components of Machete

The first part of the attack consists of a downloader that comes as a self-extracting archive,
made with 7z SFX Builder. Once the archive is unpacked by the self-extraction code, the
extractor opens a PDF or Microsoft Office file that serves as a decoy, and then runs the
downloader executable from the archive. That executable is another self-extracting file that
contains the actual downloader binary (a py2exe component) and a configuration file with
the downloader’s target URL as an encrypted string.
All download URLs we have seen are at either Dropbox or Google Docs. The files at these
URLs have all been self-extracting (RAR SFX) archives containing encrypted configuration
and py2exe backdoor components. Since May 2019, however, the Machete operators
stopped using downloaders and started to include the decoy file and backdoor components
in the same archive.
The py2exe binaries can be decompiled to obtain Python code. All of the components –
downloaders and backdoors – are obfuscated with pyobfuscate. This has been used in
previous versions of the malware as well. Figure 4 shows part of one of these obfuscated
scripts.

Figure 4. Script obfuscated with pyobfuscate

5/11

Since August 2018, the Machete components have been delivered with an extra layer of
obfuscation. The scripts now contain a block of zlib-compressed, base64-encoded text
which, after being decoded, produces a script like the one in Figure 4. This first layer of
obfuscation is produced using pyminifier with the -gzip parameter.

Backdoor components
Machete’s dropper is a RAR SFX executable. Three py2exe components are dropped:
GoogleCrash.exe, Chrome.exe and GoogleUpdate.exe. A single configuration file, jer.dll, is
dropped, and it contains base64‑encoded text that corresponds to AES‑encrypted strings. A
schema summarizing the components is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Backdoor py2exe components of Machete

GoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules execution of the
other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.
The Chrome.exe component is responsible for collection of data from the victimized
computer. It can:
Take screenshots
Log keystrokes
Access the clipboard
AES-encrypt and exfiltrate documents
Detect newly inserted drives and copy files
Execute other binaries downloaded from the C&C server
Retrieve specific files from the system
Retrieve user profile data from several browsers
Collect geolocation of victims and information about nearby Wi-Fi networks

Perform physical exfiltration to removable drives
The Machete operators are interested in obtaining specific file types from their targets.
Apart from Microsoft Office documents, drives are searched for:
Backup files
Database files
Cryptographic keys (PGP)
OpenOffice documents
Vector images
Files for geographic information systems (topographic maps, navigation routes, etc.)
Regarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi
networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides
geolocation coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons,
cell towers or Wi-Fi access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude
coordinates to build a Google Maps URL. Part of the code is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Code for geolocation

The advantage of using Mozilla Location Service is that it permits geolocation without an
actual GPS and can be more accurate than other methods. For example, an IP address can
be used to obtain an approximate location, but it is not so accurate. On the other hand, if
there is available data for the area, Mozilla Location Service can provide information such
as in which building the target is located.
The GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C
server. The configuration to set the connection is read from the jer.dll file: domain name,
username and password. The principal means of communication for Machete is via FTP,
although HTTP communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.
This component uploads encrypted files to different subdirectories on the C&C server, but it
also retrieves specific files that have been put on the server by the Machete operators. This
way, the malware can have its configuration, malicious binaries and file listings updated, but

7/11

can also download and execute other binaries.

In conclusion
The Machete group is operating more strongly than ever, even after researchers have
published technical descriptions and indicators of compromise for this malware. ESET has
been tracking this threat for months and has observed several changes, sometimes within
weeks.
At the time of this publication, the latest change introduced six backdoor components, which
are no longer py2exe executables. Python scripts for malicious components, an original
executable for Python 2.7, and all libraries used are packed into a self-extracting file.
Various artifacts that we have seen in Machete’s code and the underlying infrastructure lead
us to think that this is a Spanish-speaking group. The presence of code to exfiltrate data to
removable drives when there is physical access to a compromised computer may indicate
that Machete operators could have a presence in one of the targeted countries, although we
cannot be certain.
A full and comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) can be found in the full
white paper and on GitHub. ESET detects this threat as a variant of Python/Machete.
