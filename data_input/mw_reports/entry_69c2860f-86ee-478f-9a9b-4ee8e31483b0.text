The Operation Buhtrap campaign targets a wide range of Russian banks, used several different code signing
certificates and implements evasive methods to avoid detection.
Late in 2014, we noticed and started to track an undocumented malicious campaign targeting Russian
businesses, and that has been active for well over a year. The malware used in this campaign is a mix of off-theshelf tools, NSIS-packed malware and bespoke spyware that abuses Yandex’s Punto software, a program for
Russian users which silently and automatically changes the keyboard language depending on what the user is
typing. Once the cybercriminals have compromised a computer, they use custom tools to analyze its content,
install a backdoor and finally deploy a malicious module that spies on the system and can enumerate smart
cards.

The campaign targets a wide range of Russian banks, uses several different code signing certificates and
implements evasive methods to avoid detection. As explained later, we believe this campaign is financiallymotivated and that it targets accounting departments in Russian businesses. Operation Buhtrap is a mix of two
words: “Buhgalter” and “trap”. “Buhgalter” means “accountant” in Russian.
This campaign is of particular interest as the techniques used by these cybercriminals are often associated with
targeted attacks and not generally used by financially-motivated cybercriminals. Although we believe it to be a
different campaign, it shares some similarities with Anunak/Carbanak in terms of techniques, tactics and
procedures it uses. In this blog post, we will cover this campaign, its targets, and the tools used by these
criminals.

Targets
The cybercriminals behind this campaign are installing their software only on computers that have Russia as
their default Windows locale. The infection vector we have seen consists of Microsoft Word documents sent as
email attachments that exploit CVE-2012-0158, a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that was patched three years
ago. The images below show two of the decoy documents used in this campaign. The first document, titled
“Счет № 522375-ФЛОРЛ-14-115.doc” mimics an invoice. The second, aptly titled “kontrakt87.doc”, copies a
generic telecommunications service contract from MegaFon, a large Russian mobile phone operator.

2/13

The content of the decoy documents we’ve examined, the tactics and tools used, the references to business
applications contained in some modules, as well as some of the malicious domain names that were used in this
campaign, all lead us to believe that Russian businesses are their primary target.
If we take it into consideration that some of the Command and Control (C&C) domain names are very similar to
some accounting forums or specialized websites, and that the malware contains references to software tools
and banking applications commonly used in accounting departments, we can infer that workers belonging to this
department are the most likely primary targets.
The tools deployed on the victim’s computer allow them to control it remotely and to record the user’s actions.
The malware allows the criminals to install a backdoor, attempt to obtain the account password, and even create
a new account. They also install a keylogger, a clipboard stealer, a smart card module, and have the capability to
download and execute additional malware.
Our telemetry for the malware families linked to this campaign is shown below. Most detections we have for
these threats are located in Russia. Our telemetry also shows that the tools used by this campaign are not
widespread. This reinforces our assumption that these attackers are likely focusing primarily on businesses.

Installation Overview

4/13

If the user opens the malicious attachments on a vulnerable system, an NSIS-packed trojan downloader will be
dropped and executed. It will make several checks on the machine, first looking for malware researcher tools or
evidence that the malware is run in a virtual machine, exiting if it finds any. It will also check whether the
Windows locale is Russian (1049) and uses “FindFirst/NextUrlCacheEntry” and registry key
“Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs” to know whether URLs matching the following patterns were
visited on the computer:
*ICPortalSSL

*ibank

*i-elba

*sib.taatta.net

*ibrs

*clbank.minbank.ru

*isfront.priovtb.com

*iclient

The list of processes is quite exhaustive and does not contain only banking applications. It includes, for example,
“scardsvr.exe” which is Microsoft’s SmartCard reader. This makes sense knowing that this malware has
smartcard reader capabilities. On the other hand, some processes are hard to identify and might be there for
opportunistic reasons.
If all the requirements are met, the final stage is to download an additional file that contains all the modules used
by the cybercriminal to spy on the victim.

6/13

Interestingly, the downloaded archive may differ depending on the results of the checks above. In one of the
earlier version of the NSIS-packed downloader we analyzed, there exist two different archives that can be
downloaded from the C&C: one malicious and one benign.
One of the benign archives we downloaded ultimately installed the Windows Live Toolbar. Although the means to
install the software was malicious, the final payload wasn’t. These tactics were probably put in place to fool
automatic processing systems: since a payload was downloaded, the system could be fooled into thinking that
this is the end of the story.
The archive downloaded by the NSIS-packed dropper is a 7z self-extracting executable and contains different
modules, all distributed as 7z password-protected archives. This downloaded archive contains the different
modules used by this campaign. The picture below better describes the overall installation process and shows
the different modules.

7/13

While the different modules have very different purposes, they are all similarly packaged and a lot of them are
signed with a valid code-signing certificate. We found four different certificates used since the campaign started,
all registered to companies in Moscow. We of course notified the certificate issuer to have them revoked.

The table below lists the different certificates that were found linked to this campaign. We believe they were all
fraudulently obtained.

All the modules that make up this threat share a common install procedure. They are all 7z self-extracting
executables that first decompress a password-protected archive and then execute an install.cmd file. The
following is the first install.cmd file that gets invoked after the first module has been downloaded and executed:

8/13

The install.cmd file will then install the malware or run the various tools, but will first learn more about the
machine it is about to compromise, especially about the account privileges it currently has and which version of
Windows is installed.
If administrator privileges are required and malware is run on a limited account, it uses two different techniques
to attempt privilege escalation.
The first approach uses two files, l1.exe and cc1.exe, which implement a variant of the trick used in the leaked
Carberp source code. It copies cryptbase.dll to %USERPROFILE%, patches it so that it launches the malware
on execution and packs it as a MSU file. Finally, it uses wusa.exe to copy it to the system directory before
launching it. The other technique exploits CVE-2013-3660. Each module that requires privilege escalation has a
32- and 64-bit version of this exploit. If gaining administrator privileges is required, the install.cmd file will try to
use either of these techniques to escalate privileges locally in order to install the different modules.
While tracking this campaign, we downloaded different overall packages. Interestingly, the modules they
contained were not the same. This leads us to believe that different targets might receive different modules.

System Preparation – mimi.exe and xtm.exe
This module will try to:
Recover account passwords
Enable remote desktop service
Create a new account on the compromised computer
mimi.exe includes a modified version of Mimikatz, a well-known open source tool allowing password recovery
for users logged in a Windows system. Both the 32- and 64-bit versions of the tools are included in the
executable resources. While the account password recovery functionality is still there, the executable was
modified to remove the user interaction part of the tool. The executable is also modified so that when run, it will
invoke in succession the “privilege::debug” and “sekurlsa:logonPasswords” commands, effectively compromising
the current local account password.

9/13

xtm.exe has different behavior to reach its goals depending on which Windows version it is run. In WinXP, it has
scripts that will enable remote desktop services and try to create a new account. These steps are required to
give the malware authors full control over the compromised system. xtm.exe will also change system settings, to
allow multiple users to be logged on to the computer at the same time. The screenshot below shows an example
of the type of commands run on a WinXP machine.

Backdoor – lmpack.exe
This module’s sole purpose is to install a backdoor onto the system. It will try to install LiteManager, a third-party
tool that allows remote control of a system.

Once this software is installed, it allows the cybercriminals to connect directly to the victim’s computer and
control it remotely. This software even has a command line option to install the application silently, to create
firewall rules, and finally to start LiteManager silently. Of course all these options are abused by the
cybercriminals.

Spying module – pn_pack.exe
This module is responsible for spying on the user and communicating with the C&C. It will first install Punto,
software made by Yandex that can automatically change keyboard language as the user types. The
cybercriminals are then misusing this software to run the spying module through DLL side loading and are using
it to

10/13

Log all keystrokes and copy clipboard content
Enumerate smart cards present on the system
Handle C&C communications
The module that is ultimately responsible for these tasks is an encrypted DLL that is decrypted and loaded into
memory at runtime by the Punto process. It launches three threads that will ultimately perform the work outlined
above. The fact that Punto is misused by this malware for keylogging purposes is not surprising: several Russian
forums detail explicitly how to misuse this application for this purpose.
This module uses RC4 to encrypt its strings as well as its network communication. It will reach out to the C&C
every two minutes, transmitting any data that have been stolen from the compromised system. A screenshot of a
network communication as well as the different commands that can be received from the server are shown
below.

Command

Description

MZ

The data sent is an executable. The banker module will execute it through the CreateProcess
API

LD

The data sent is code. The banker module will copy it into executable memory and will execute it
by launching a new thread.

As the server commands are sent as a response to a status update from the user, it is not unimaginable that
special code will be sent for specific events, such as when a smart card is detected on the system.
Interestingly, in all the banker modules we analyzed (the latest one having a compilation time of January 18th),
there is a string “TEST_BOTNET” that is sent in every communication with the C&C. At this point, it is unclear
what this means as people and organizations have already been compromised by this malware. As we believe
this operation has been ongoing for more than a year, this is intriguing. Perhaps the future holds the answer.

Conclusion
We can imagine the fraudsters operating in this way: they first compromise a single computer in a business by
sending a spam and luring the person into opening the attachment.
Once the malware is installed on the victim’s computer, the cybercriminals have access to several tools that will
help them to first compromise other computers in the company and second, spy on the user and see whether
some fraudulent banking transactions can be performed.

11/13

While the tools and software used in this campaign are far from being novel, the overall campaign is quite
interesting and intriguing: it diverges quite a bit from the traditional banking malware with which we are familiar.
This campaign is using specific tools to reach its goal, akin to what we are accustomed to see in targeted
attacks. Seeing a campaign like this, inevitably the Anunak/Carbanak documented by Fox-IT and Kaspersky
comes to mind. Although we believe that this campaign is different, some similarities were observed. The
infection vector is similar, it uses a similar modified mimikatz application, and it uses a third-party remote access
tool, changes system settings to allow concurrent RDP sessions, and so on.
It will be interesting to see whether this kind of operation will become the norm and if the popularity of traditional
banking trojan families will diminish in return.
