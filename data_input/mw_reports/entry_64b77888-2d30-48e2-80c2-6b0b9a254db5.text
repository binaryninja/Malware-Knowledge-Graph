Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior from France
and Russia

April 7, 2022

Today we removed three separate networks for violating our policy against foreign or
government interference which is coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) on behalf of
a foreign or government entity. These networks originated in France and Russia and
targeted multiple countries in North Africa and the Middle East.
In each case, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake
accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what
they are doing, and that was the basis for our action. When we investigate and remove these
operations, we focus on behavior rather than content, no matter who‚Äôs behind them, what
they post, or whether they‚Äôre foreign or domestic.

Over the past three years, we‚Äôve shared our findings on over 100 networks of coordinated
inauthentic behavior we detected and removed from our platforms. Earlier this year, we
started publishing monthly CIB reports where we share information about the networks we
take down to make it easier for people to see the progress we‚Äôre making in one place. In
some cases, like today, we also share our findings soon after our enforcement. Today‚Äôs
takedowns will also be included in our December report.
Before we share the details on each network, here are a few trends to note.
Each of the networks we removed today targeted people outside of their country of origin,
primarily targeting Africa, and also some countries in the Middle East. We found all three of
them as a result of our proactive internal investigations and worked with external researchers
to assess the full scope of these activities across the internet.
While we‚Äôve seen influence operations target the same regions in the past, this was the first
time our team found two campaigns ‚Äî from France and Russia ‚Äî actively engage with one
another, including by befriending, commenting and criticizing the opposing side for being
fake. It appears that this Russian network was an attempt to rebuild their operations after our
October 2019 takedown, which also coincided with a notable shift in focus of the French
campaign to begin to post about Russia‚Äôs manipulation campaigns in Africa.
Unlike the operation from France, both Russia-linked networks relied on local nationals in the
countries they targeted to generate content and manage their activity across internet
services. This is consistent with cases we exposed in the past, including in Ghana and the
US, where we saw the Russian campaigns co-opt authentic voices to join their influence
operations, likely to avoid detection and help appear more authentic. Despite these efforts,
our investigation identified some links between these two Russian campaigns and also with
our past enforcements.
We know operations like these will continue to evolve their tactics in response to both the
evolution of the information environment but also in reaction to our detection and removals.
Over time, it‚Äôs become clear that the more we and others in the defender community learn
these deceptive behaviors and technical signals associated with particular threat actors, the
more consistent we now are in detecting them earlier in their life cycle, making it harder for
these campaigns to go undetected for long periods of time.
We shared information about our findings with law enforcement and industry partners. We
are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we‚Äôve said before, it‚Äôs an ongoing effort
and we‚Äôre committed to continually improving to stay ahead.

What We Found
1. We removed 84 Facebook accounts, 6 Pages, 9 Groups and 14 Instagram accounts
for violating our policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior. This activity
originated in France and targeted primarily the Central African Republic and Mali, and
2/14

to a lesser extent Niger, Burkina Faso, Algeria, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and Chad.
The people behind this activity used fake accounts ‚Äî some of which had already been
detected and disabled by our automated systems ‚Äî to pose as locals in the countries they
targeted, post and comment on content, and manage Pages and Groups. They posted
primarily in French and Arabic about news and current events including France‚Äôs policies in
Francophone Africa, the security situation in various African countries, claims of potential
Russian interference in the election in the Central African Republic (CAR), supportive
commentary about French military, and criticism of Russia‚Äôs involvement in CAR. Some of
these accounts also commented on the content that criticized France posted by one of the
Russian operations.
We found this activity as part of our internal investigation into suspected coordinated
inauthentic behavior in Francophone Africa. Although the people behind it attempted to
conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals
associated with French military.
Presence on Facebook and Instagram: 84 Facebook accounts, 6 Pages, 9 Groups and
14 accounts on Instagram.
Followers: About 4,700 accounts followed one or more of these Pages, about 1,400
accounts joined one or more of these Groups and around 200 people followed one or
more of these Instagram accounts. (Updated on January 28, 2021 at 3:00PM PT to
reflect the latest numbers for accounts following these Pages and accounts.)
Below is a sample of the content posted by some of these Pages and accounts:

2. We also removed 61 Facebook accounts, 29 Pages, 7 Groups and 1 Instagram
account for coordinated inauthentic behavior. (Updated on January 28, 2021 at 3:00PM
PT to reflect the latest enforcement numbers for accounts and Pages removed.) This
network originated in Russia and focused primarily on the Central African Republic
(CAR), and to a lesser extent on Madagascar, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea,
Mozambique, South Africa and the CAR diaspora in France.
We identified several clusters of connected activity that relied on local nationals from Central
African Republic and South Africa. This network used a combination of fake and
compromised accounts ‚Äî some of which had been already detected and disabled by our
automated systems ‚Äî to comment, amplify their own content, drive people to off-platform

domains and run Groups and Pages posing as news and civic-focused entities. They also
solicited content from local journalists. The people behind this activity took operational
security steps to conceal their location and identity.
This network posted primarily in French, English, Portuguese and Arabic about news and
current events, including COVID-19 and the Russian vaccine against the virus, the upcoming
election in CAR, terrorism, Russia‚Äôs presence in Sub-Saharan Africa, supportive commentary
about the CAR government, criticism of the French foreign policy and a fictitious coup d‚Äôetat
in Equatorial Guinea. Some of these accounts commented on the content by the Francebased CIB network described above, including in response to its criticism of Russia.
We found this activity as a result of our investigation into the suspected coordinated
inauthentic behavior with links to the network we removed in October 2019. Our assessment
benefited from information shared with us by researchers at Graphika. Although the people
behind this campaign attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation
found links to individuals associated with past activity by the Internet Research Agency (IRA)
and previous operations we attributed to entities associated with Russian financier Yevgeniy
Prigozhin, who was indicted by the US Justice Department.
Presence on Facebook and Instagram: 61 Facebook accounts, 29 Pages, 7 Groups
and 1 Instagram account (Updated on January 28, 2021 at 3:00PM PT to reflect the
latest enforcement numbers for accounts and Pages removed.)
Followers: About 263,000 accounts followed one or more of these Pages, around
29,000 people joined one or more of these Groups and 0 people followed this
Instagram account.
Advertising: About $38,000 in spending for ads on Facebook and Instagram paid for
primarily in South African rand and US dollars.

Bangui on December 04, 2020 The Central African Head of State, Professor ArchangesFaustin TOUADERA participated in the inauguration of BARC after several months of work.
Note that after the appointment of SANI YALO at the head of BARC, the image of this
building which was once far from bearing the name ‚ÄúBARC‚Äù changed at the halt. Note also
that before SANI -YALO is appointed at the head of this building, BARC has a revenue of 83
million and a debt of 3 billion CFA francs. But with SANI YALO, this building is rehabilitated
and modernized with an order for several trucks (200) which will be delivered in the days to
come ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòThe Central African Head of State, Professor Archange-Faustin TOUADERA has
only one option, to give the chance to those who have the will to move the Central African
Republic forward to update their thoughts on advancement.

3. We also removed 197 Facebook accounts, 122 Pages, 16 Groups and 15 Instagram
accounts for coordinated inauthentic behavior. (Updated on January 28, 2021 at 3:00PM
PT to reflect the latest enforcement numbers for accounts and Pages removed.) This
network originated in Russia and focused primarily on Libya, Sudan and Syria.
We identified several decentralized clusters of connected activity that relied on local
nationals from Libya, Egypt, Sudan and Syria. This operation used fake accounts ‚Äî many of
which had been detected and removed by our automated systems at the time of creation or

11/14

soon thereafter ‚Äî to post in Groups, amplify the off-platform domains posing as news
outlets, evade enforcement, and manage Pages masquerading as news entities and militaryaffiliated entities in Libya. These accounts posed as locals based in the countries they
targeted. Some of these Pages went through significant name changes over time.
The people behind this activity posted primarily in Arabic about regional news and events,
including misinformation; supportive commentary about Khalifa Haftar, head of the Libyan
National Army, the Libyan army, and Saif Islam Gaddafi; and criticism of Turkey, Muslim
Brotherhood, the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord and the peace talks at the
Libyan Political Dialogue Forum in Tunisia.
We found this activity as a result of our proactive internal investigation into the suspected
coordinated inauthentic behavior in the region ‚Äî with some limited links to the networks we
removed in October 2019. Our assessment benefited from public reporting by the Stanford
Internet Observatory on a portion of this activity. Although the people behind this activity
attempted to conceal their identity and coordination, our investigation found links to
individuals associated with past activity by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA).
Presence on Facebook and Instagram: 197 Facebook accounts, 122 Pages, 16
Groups and 15 Instagram account (Updated on January 28, 2021 at 3:00PM PT to
reflect the latest enforcement numbers for accounts and Pages removed.)
Followers: About 5.7 million accounts followed one or more of these Pages, 64,500
accounts joined one or more of these Groups and about 99,500 people followed one or
more of these Instagram accounts.
Advertising: Around $186,000 in spending for ads on Facebook paid for primarily in US
dollars and rubles.
