We recently discovered ransomware, which performs MSDTC service DLL Hijacking to
silently execute its payload. We have named this ransomware CatB, based on the contact
email that the ransomware group uses. The sample was first uploaded to VT on November
23, 2022 and tagged by the VT community as a possible variant of the Pandora
Ransomware. The assumed connection to the Pandora Ransomware was due to some
similarities between the CatB and Pandora ransom notes. However, the similarities pretty
much end there. The CatB ransomware implements several anti-VM techniques to verify
execution on a “real machine”, followed by a malicious DLL drop and DLL hijacking to evade
detection.
CatB ransomware contains two files, the dropper (version.dll), packed with UPX, and the
ransomware payload (oci.dll). The dropper handles anti-VM checks, dropping the
ransomware payload and executing it.

Anti-VM
CatB dropper implements three anti-VM/sandbox evasion techniques:
Processor core check – Real computers nowadays all have at least two processors,
so if the ransomware detects only one CPU core, that would be a strong indicator that it
is currently residing on in a sandbox.The ransomware retrieves system information by
GetSystemInfo API function and checks the number of processors. If there are less
than two processors, it exits and does not execute.

Total Physical memory check – As opposed to virtual machines, real machines today
all have at least 2GB RAM, and usually have between 4GB and 32GB. The CatB
Ransomware detects VMs/sandboxes by checking physical memory size. This is done
by retrieving the information about both the physical and virtual memory using the
GlobalMemoryStatusEx API function. In our case, the ransomware checks and exits if
the machine has at less than 2GB of physical memory.

Hard Drive size – Malware can check the machine hdd size and continue execution
leaning on that parameter. This can be done by using the DeviceIoControl Api function
with ‘0x70000’ passed as the dwIoControlCode parameter. CatB ransomware will
execute only in a machine with at least a 50GB hard drive.

DLL Hijacking
If all anti-VM checks pass, the dropper will continue its execution and drop the ransomware
payload (oci.dll) into the C:\Windows\System32 folder. Next, it looks for the MSDTC service
(the Distributed Transaction Coordinator Windows service that is responsible for coordinating
transactions between databases (SQL Server) and web servers) and changes its
configurations.

The configurations changed are the name of the account under which the service should run,
which is changed from Network Service to Local System, and the service start option, which
is changed from Demand start to Auto start for persistency if a restart occurs.

The account under which the service runs was changed to grant admin rights to the service,
as the Network Service account runs with user rights. The cChangeing of the start type will
grants the ransomware the ability to executeion every time the system restarts.
The dropper starts the service after changing its configuration. When this service starts, it
attempts to load, by default, several DLLs from the System32 folder. This gives it the
opportunity to plant an arbitrary DLL (in our case, oci.dll) into this folder in order to execute
malicious code.
Ransomware
The Malicious oci.dll file is loaded into the msdtc.exe process, after which the encryption
process starts. CatB enumerates and encrypts specific hardcoded disks and folders:
1. Disk D:\
2. Disk E:\
3. Disk F:\
4. Disk G:\
5. Disk H:\
6. Disk I:\
7. All files under C:\Users and its sub-directories
8.

CatB avoids encrypting files with .msi, .exe, .dll, .sys, .iso extensions and the NTUSER.DAT
file. An interesting thing about the CatB ransomware is that the ransom note is added into
the beginning of every encrypted file and not as a separate file in every folder as most of the
ransomwares do. It also doesn’t change the file extensions. This might initially confuse users
who may not notice the encryption and the file will just appear to be corrupted as they would
be unable to open it as its binary contents are broken. The ransom note itself looks very
similarly built to Pandora and Crypt ransom notes, with some sections actually being
copy/pastes from them:

There is no official ransom name in the note and no tor website URL. The only method
available to contact the ransomware operator is via email.

Prevention
Minerva Armor’s Ransomware Protection Platform easily prevents CatB ransomware by
simulating environmental data that the ransomware is actively trying to avoid.
For example when the ransomware queries for the number of processors, Minerva Armor
leads it to believe that it is in an environment with only 1 CPU.
