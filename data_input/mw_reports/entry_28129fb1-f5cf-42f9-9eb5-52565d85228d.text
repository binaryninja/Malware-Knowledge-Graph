FIREBALL – The Chinese Malware of 250 Million
Computers Infected
blog.checkpoint.com/2017/06/01/fireball-chinese-malware-250-million-infection/
June 1, 2017

Check Point Threat Intelligence and research teams recently discovered a high volume
Chinese threat operation which has infected over 250 million computers worldwide. The
installed malware, Fireball, takes over target browsers and turns them into zombies.
Fireball has two main functionalities: the ability of running any code on victim computers–
downloading any file or malware, and hijacking and manipulating infected users’ web-traffic
to generate ad-revenue. Currently, Fireball installs plug-ins and additional configurations to
boost its advertisements, but just as easily it can turn into a prominent distributor for any
additional malware.
This operation is run by Rafotech, a large digital marketing agency based in Beijing.
Rafotech uses Fireball to manipulate the victims’ browsers and turn their default search
engines and home-pages into fake search engines. This redirects the queries to either
yahoo.com or Google.com. The fake search engines include tracking pixels used to collect
the users’ private information. Fireball has the ability to spy on victims, perform efficient
malware dropping, and execute any malicious code in the infected machines, this creates a
massive security flaw in targeted machines and networks.
KEY FINDINGS
Check Point analysts uncovered a high volume Chinese threat operation which has
infected over 250 million computers worldwide, and 20% of corporate networks.

The malware, called Fireball, acts as a browser-hijacker but and can be turned into a
full-functioning malware downloader. Fireball is capable of executing any code on the
victim machines, resulting in a wide range of actions from stealing credentials to
dropping additional malware.
Fireball is spread mostly via bundling i.e. installed on victim machines alongside a
wanted program, often without the user’s consent.
The operation is run by Chinese digital marketing agency.
Top infected countries are India (10.1%) and Brazil (9.6%)

INFECTED
The scope of the malware distribution is alarming. According to our analysis, over 250
million computers worldwide have been infected: specifically, 25.3 million infections in
India (10.1%), 24.1 million in Brazil (9.6%), 16.1 million in Mexico (6.4%), and 13.1 million in
Indonesia (5.2%). The United States has witnessed 5.5 million infections (2.2%).
Based on Check Point’s global sensors, 20% of all corporate networks are affected . Hit
rates in the US (10.7%) and China (4.7%) are alarming;but Indonesia (60%), India (43%)
and Brazil (38%) have much more dangerous hit rates.
2/11

Another indicator of the incredibly high infection rate is the popularity of Rafotech’s fake
search engines. According to Alexa’s web traffic data, 14 of these fake search engines are
among the top 10,000 websites, with some of them occasionally reaching the top 1,000.

Ironically, although Rafotech doesn’t admit it produces browser-hijackers and fake search
engines, it does (proudly) declare itself a successful marketing agency, reaching 300 million
users worldwide – coincidentally similar to our number of estimated infections.

A BACKDOOR TO EVERY INFECTED NETWORK
Fireball and similar browser-hijackers are hybrid creatures, half seemingly legitimate
software (see the GOING UNDER THE RADAR section), and half malware. Although
Rafotech uses Fireball only for advertising and initiating traffic to its fake search engines, it
can perform any action on the victims’ machines These actions can have serious
consequences. How severe is it? Try to imagine a pesticide armed with a nuclear bomb.
Yes, it can do the job, but it can also do much more.
These browser-hijackers are capable on the browser level. This means that they can drive
victims to malicious sites, spy on them and conduct successful malware dropping.
From a technical perspective, Fireball displays great sophistication and quality evasion
techniques, including anti-detection capabilities, multi-layer structure and a flexible C&C– it
is not inferior to a typical malware.
Many threat actors would like to have a fraction of Rafotech’s power, as Fireball provides a
critical backdoor, which can be further exploited.
GOING UNDER THE RADAR
While the distribution of Fireball is both malicious and illegitimate, it actually carries digital
certificates imparting them a legitimate appearance. Confused? You should be.

4/11

Rafotech carefully walks along the edge of legitimacy, knowing that adware distribution is
not considered a crime like malware distribution is. How is that? Many companies provide
software or services for free, and make their profits by harvesting data or presenting
advertisements. Once a client agrees to the installment of extra features or software to
his/her computer, it is hard to claim malicious intent on behalf of the provider.
This gray zone led to the birth of a new kind of monetizing method – bundling. Bundling is
when a wanted program installs another program alongside it, sometimes with a user’s
authorization and sometimes without. Rafotech uses bundling in high volume to spread
Fireball.

Figure 4: Bundling in Action
According to our analysis, Rafotech’s distribution methods appear to be illegitimate and
don’t follow the criteria which would allow these actions to be considered naïve or legal. The
malware and the fake search engines don’t carry indicators connecting them to Rafotech,
they cannot be uninstalled by an ordinary user, and they conceal their true nature.
So how do they carry digital certificates? One possibility is that issuers make their living
from providing certificates, and small issuers with flexible ethics can enjoy the lack of clarity
in the adware world’s legality to approve software such as Rafotech’s browser-hijackers.
THE INFECTION MODEL

5/11

As with other types of malware, there are many ways for Fireball to spread. We suspect that
two popular vectors are bundling the malware to other Rafotech products – Deal Wifi and
Mustang Browser – as well as bundling via other freeware distributors: products such as
“Soso Desktop”, “FVP Imageviewer” and others.
It’s important to remember that when a user installs freeware, additional malware isn’t
necessarily dropped at the same time. If you download a suspicious freeware and nothing
happens on the spot, it doesn’t necessarily mean that something isn’t happening behind the
scenes.
Furthermore, it is likely that Rafotech is using additional distribution methods, such as
spreading freeware under fake names, spam, or even buying installs from threat actors.
As with everything in the internet, remember that there are no free lunches. When you
download freeware, or use cost-free services (streaming and downloads, for example), the
service provider is making profit somehow. If it’s not from you or from advertisements, it will
come from somewhere else.

HOW CAN I KNOW IF I AM INFECTED?

6/11

To check if you’re infected, first open your web browser. Was your home-page set by you?
Are you able to modify it? Are you familiar with your default search engine and can modify
that as well? Do you remember installing all of your browser extensions?
If the answer to any of these questions is “NO”, this is a sign that you’re infected with
adware. You can also use a recommended adware scanner, just to be extra cautious.

THE RED BUTTON IN THE WRONG HANDS
It doesn’t take much to imagine a scenario in which Rafotech decides to harvest sensitive
information from all of its infected machines, and sell this data to threat groups or business
rivals. Banking and credit card credentials, medical files, patents and business plans can all
be widely exposed and abused by threat actors for various purposes. Based on our
estimated infection rate, in such a scenario, one out of five corporations worldwide will be
susceptible to a major breach. Severe damage can be caused to key organizations, from
major service providers to critical infrastructure operators to medical institutions. The
potential loss is indescribable, and repairing the damage caused by such massive data
leakage (if even possible) could take years.
Rafotech holds the power to initiate a global catastrophe and it is not alone. During our
research we’ve tracked down additional browser-hijackers that, to our understanding, were
developed by other companies. One such company is ELEX Technology, an Internet
Services company also based in Beijing produces products similar to those of Rafotech.
7/11

Several findings lead us to suspect that the two companies are related, and may be
collaborating in the distribution of browser-hijackers or in trading customers’ traffic. For
example, an adware developed by ELEX, named YAC (“Yet Another Cleaner”) is suspected
to be connected to Rafotech’s operation, dropping its browser-hijackers.
CONCLUSION
In this research we’ve described Rafotech’s browser-hijackers operation – possibly the
largest infection operation in history. We believe that although this is not a typical malware
attack campaign, it has the potential to cause irreversible damage to its victims as well as
worldwide internet users, and therefore it must be blocked by security companies.
The full distribution of Fireball is not yet known, but it is clear that it presents a great threat
to the global cyber ecosystem. With a quarter billion infected machines and a grip in one of
every five corporate networks, Rafotech’s activities make it an immense threat.
