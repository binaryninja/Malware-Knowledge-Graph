ERMAC 2.0: Perfecting the Account Takeover
ERMAC, an Android banking trojan enables bad actors to determine when certain
apps are launched and then overwrites the screen display to steal the user’s
credentials; putting billions of users at risk.
Aug 31, 2022
Android device security has improved dramatically in recent years, motivated by market and
competitive forces. In part, Android security development teams have accomplished this by
focusing on the tools used by malware developers and mitigating their effectiveness.
Malware developers, in response, have had to get creative to achieve their nefarious tasks.
One example is ERMAC, an Android banking trojan that surfaced in August 2021. Based on
the Cerberus banking trojan, ERMAC abuses a built-in feature in the Android Accessibility
Suite intended for users with disabilities. The feature enables actors to accomplish tasks on
Android devices that they otherwise could not do. Specifically, ERMAC uses the Accessibility
Suite to determine when certain apps are launched and then overwrites the screen display to
steal the user’s credentials. Users are usually infected with ERMAC through fake browser
update sites.

Overlay Attacks
Commonly known as an "Overlay" or "Web Injection" attack, ERMAC targets over 400
banking, financial and ecommerce mobile applications – including Amazon, PayPal, and
Microsoft - to hijack credentials. Injections are amongst the oldest and most dangerous
attacks aimed at applications. In this case, HTML code is injected, resulting in overwritten
apps that fool users.

applications.
Users of those apps think they have opened a legitimate app but are presented with
illegitimate content from the malware. When users enter their credentials, the ERMAC trojan
captures them. From the end-user perspective, it is hard to discern whether anything is
different or wrong.
Users must explicitly grant ERMAC access to the Accessibility Suite to perform the overlay
attack. ERMAC typically attempts this by asking users to grant access via a pop-up. If
access is granted, users unknowingly give this set of privileges to the malware.

Once active, the malware performs actions such as knowing which apps are being launched
and redrawing the screen while another app is in focus. Further, it gathers and forwards a list
of all installed apps to the command-and-control server. In response, the server sends back
injection content for other applications.

Subverting Multi-factor Authentication
According to Duo Labs (Cisco/Duo Security) State of the Auth report, multi-factor
authentication (MFA) has gained significant adoption, with 79% of respondents using it in
2021. And most end users do feel they have strong protection against credential theft and
account takeover when using MFA for their online and mobile transactions. After all, if your
credentials are stolen but MFA is enabled, your data and apps are still safe, right?
Wrong! What makes ERMAC so formidable is its ability to get around authentication
methods, thus circumventing MFA. An ERMAC feature known as Google Authentication
Grabber essentially turns ERMAC into an account takeover tool as it steals Google
Authentication tokens. ERMAC can also steal authentication tokens sent via SMS. So, even
if you are doing all the right things – strong passwords and MFA – you are still subject to
account takeover.

The Bigger Picture
It is easy to become complacent and categorize any malware as a one-off. But a detailed
analysis reveals that a highly sophisticated e-crime ecosystem supports ERMAC, its
developers and users.
As reported by researchers, the mastermind group promoting the ERMAC malware is
DukeEugene, aka Duke Eugene or Eugene. They rent the malware, as a service (MaaS),
on underground forums for $5,000 per month, facilitate client communications and provide
access to the malware control panel. DukeEugene has history and expertise in this area,
claiming to be the 2020 author of the BlackRock Android banking trojan. That trojan also
used the MaaS model.

The online forums serving as a marketplace for selling ERMAC and other MaaS offerings are
hosted by "bulletproof posting (BPH) services," which provide infrastructure and hosting
services to criminal actors. These BPHs offer the basic building blocks for illicit command
and control servers and services. BPH providers advertise specific services but often provide
support beyond what they tout on the underground forums.
One of the world’s “top tier” bulletproof hosting providers, actor Yalishanda is associated
with ERMAC. Intel 471’s research revealed that some bot configurations, designed for
ERMAC to connect to command and control servers, lead to Yalishanda's bulletproof hosting
infrastructure. Yalishanda has been active for years, reportedly moving between China and
Russia. His methods and longevity underscore that this high level of e-crime sophistication is
not going away.
ERMAC will likely continue to undergo feature enhancements just like any other app. But it is
essential to realize this is not just another clever, creative piece of malware; it is malware
supported by a sophisticated criminal group with expertise, longevity and infrastructure.
Android users who rely on banking, financial and ecommerce apps must thus remain vigilant
and aware of this persistent threat.
