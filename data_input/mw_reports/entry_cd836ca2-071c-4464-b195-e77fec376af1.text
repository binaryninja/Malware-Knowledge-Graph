Last week, TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes
environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the
attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave
Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors,
mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim. In this blog, I will
explore these container images and what they were designed to do.
The Docker Hub account ‘heavy0x0james’ was created on June 3rd, 2019. In February
2021, the adversaries uploaded six malicious container images that have been observed to
perform attacks in the wild. All six container images initially run a shell file named init.sh, but
in each image it does something different. Then the attackers leverage a binary named zgrab
(MD5= 7691c55732fded10fca0d6ccc64e41dc) in order to scan the internet for more victims.
Below is the list of these malicious container images and their capabilities:

Conclusion
Over the last few years, we at Team Nautilus have detected many kinds of attacks against
Docker and Kubernetes environments, but this is the first time that we see a campaign
designed to massively and systematically scan the internet, search for specific
misconfigurations or outdated software, and attack the potential victims. Some of these
images deploy a cryptominer, some open backdoors, and others are looking to steal AWS
keys. These findings should alert security practitioners that even the smallest
misconfiguration even for a fraction of time matters as it can result in a cyberattack.
When working with Docker and
1. Regularly update your cloud software, specifically Docker and Kubernetes
projects. Previous versions typically have more known vulnerabilities.
2. If possible, avoid exposing unnecessary APIs to the internet. Additionally, try
limiting APIs inbound and outbound traffic to your organization’s network range.
3. Review authorization and authentication policies, basic security policies, and
adjust them according to the principle of least privilege.
4. Regularly monitor the runtime environment. This includes monitoring the running
containers, their images, and the processes that they run. Investigate logs, mostly
around user actions, look for actions you can’t account for regular anomalies or
outliers.
5. Implement a security strategy where you can easily enforce runtime policies, as well as
consider using cloud security tools that will widen your scope and reach within your
cloud resources.
