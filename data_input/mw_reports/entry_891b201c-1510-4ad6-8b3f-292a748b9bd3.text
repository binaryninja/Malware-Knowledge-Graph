Our research team has uncovered new way to leverage mechanisms of the underlying Windows operating
system in order to inject malicious code. Threat actors can use this technique, which exists by design of the
operating system, to bypass current security solutions that attempt to prevent infection. We named this
technique AtomBombing based on the name of the underlying mechanism that this technique exploits.

AtomBombing a ects all Windows version. In particular, we tested this against Windows 10.
Unfortunately, this issue cannot be patched since it doesn’t rely on broken or awed code – rather on how
these operating system mechanisms are designed.

Code Injection 101
The issue we revealed presents a way for threat actors to inject code. Attackers use code injection to add
malicious code into legitimate processes, making it easier to bypass security products, hide from the user,
and extract sensitive information that would otherwise be unattainable.
For example, let’s say an attacker was able to persuade a user to run a malicious executable, evil.exe. Any kind
of decent application level rewall installed on the computer would block that executable’s communication.
To overcome this issue, evil.exe would have to nd a way to manipulate a legitimate program, such as a web
browser, so that the legitimate program would carry out communication on behalf of evil.exe.
This manipulation technique is known as code injection.

Code Injection: An Important Tool in the
Attacker’s Toolbox
There are quite a few reasons why code injection is useful. An attacker may use code injection, for example,
to:
1. Bypass process level restrictions: Many security products employ a white list of trusted processes. If the
attacker is able to inject malicious code into one of those trusted processes, the security product can

easily be bypassed.
2. Access to context-speci c data. Some data is only accessible to certain processes, while inaccessible to
others. For example:
a. Taking screenshots. A process that takes a screenshot of the user's screen, must run within the context
of the user's desktop. However, more often than not malware will be loaded into the services desktop,
not the user’s, preventing the malware from taking a screenshot of the user's desktop. Using code
injection, a malware can inject code into a process that’s already running in the user's desktop, take a
picture and send it back to the malware in the services desktop.
b. Performing Man in the Browser (MitB) attacks. By injecting code into a web browser an attacker can
modify the content shown to the user. For example, in a banking transaction process, the customer will
always be shown the exact payment information as the customer intended via con rmation screens.
However, the attacker modi es the data so that the bank receives false transaction information in favor
of the attacker, i.e. a di erent destination account number and possibly amount. In a MitB attack, the
customers are unaware of the money being funneled out of their account until it’s too late.
c. Accessing encrypted passwords. Google Chrome encrypts the user's stored passwords by using
Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI). This API uses data derived from the current user to
encrypt/decrypt the data and access the passwords. In this scenario, a malware that is not running in
the context of the user will not be able to access the passwords. However, if the malware injects code
into a process that's already running in the context of the current user, the plain-text passwords can be
easily accessed.

Behind the Scenes of AtomBombing
The underlying Windows mechanism which AtomBombing exploits is called atom tables. These tables are
provided by the operating system to allow applications to store and access data. These atom tables can also
be used to share data between applications.
What we found is that a threat actor can write malicious code into an atom table and force a legitimate
program to retrieve the malicious code from the table. We also found that the legitimate program, now
containing the malicious code, can be manipulated to execute that code.
For the technology deep dive, please the researcher’s post here: https://breakingmalware.com/injectiontechniques/atombombing-brand-new-code-injection-for-windows/

Code Injections in the Past
Currently there are just a handful of known code injection techniques. A list of several of these can be found
here: http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/code-injection-techniques/
Additionally, last summer our research team found a new code injection technique called PowerLoaderEx.
PowerLoaderEx enables an attacker to inject code without needing to actually write code or data to the
injected process.
Once a code injection technique is well-known, security products focused on preventing attackers from
compromising the endpoints (such as anti-virus and host intrusion prevention systems), typically update their
signatures accordingly. So once the injection is known, it can be detected and mitigated by the security
products.
Being a new code injection technique, AtomBombing bypasses AV, NGAV and other endpoint in ltration
prevention solutions.

Mitigation
AtomBombing is performed just by using the underlying Windows mechanisms. There is no need to exploit
operating system bugs or vulnerabilities.

AtomBombing: A Code Injection that Bypasses Current Security Solutions

Since the issue cannot be xed, there is no notion of a patch for this. Thus, the direct mitigation answer
would be to tech-dive into the API calls and monitor those for malicious activity.
It’s important though at this point to take a step back. AtomBombing is one more technique in the attacker’s
toolbox. Threat actors will continuously take out a tool – used or new - to ensure that they bypass antiin ltration technologies (such as AV, NGAV, HIPS, etc).
Obviously we need to nd a di erent way to deal with threat actors. Under the assumption that threat actors
will always exploit known and unknown techniques, we need to build our defenses in a way that prevents the
consequences of the attack once the threat actor has already compromised the environment.

Got here from: http://thehackernews.com/2016/...
A lot of hype from that site.
#1 you say "For example, let’s say an attacker was able to persuade a user to run a malicious
executable, evil.exe"
Yea! Hello? If you get any "evil.exe" run on your system you're in trouble.
Not by this technique alone, as the executable can install a number of components (rootkits) in
userland and/or kernel space.
That page goes on to hype it up more talking about "encryption" key hijacking, etc., which is not
particular to this technique..

AtomBombing: A Code Injection that Bypasses Current Security Solutions

Tal_Liberman > MonkeyBoy • 4 months ago

This technique can be used post infection to inject code from one process to another. For
example, on a computer protected by modern security software a malicious executable
such as evil.exe will not be able to communicate because it would be blocked by a
ﬁrewall. It would need to inject code into a browser in order to communicate which will
also be blocked by any standard AV. By using AtomBombing evil.exe can inject code into
a web browser undetected by said AV and then have the web browser communicate on its
behalf undetected by said ﬁrewall.

Why not just use CreateRemoteThread or NtQueueApcThread calling something
like LoadLibrary? Using atom tables just sounds like it would achieve the same
goal with added hassle, and you wouldn't gain anything, since it still requires
NtQueueApcThread, which AFAIK most AV hooks at runtime. It's been used for a
while now, see e.g., [1]
[1]: http://www.codeproject.com/Art...

Use CreateRemoteThread or NtQueueApcThread to call LoadLibrary and
any AV will catch you. Use AtomBombing and you'll bypass most AV
products.
Some AVs do hook NtQueueApcThread but they'll only ﬂag your malicious
behavior if you use NtQueueApcThread to call LoadLibrary or some code
that was allocated dynamically with VirtualAllocEx. Also if you use
NtQueueApcThread to call LoadLibrary you must place a DLL ﬁle on the
disk, which will be picked up by the AV and sent to its cloud service for
reputation analysis. AtomBombing allows you to inject shellcode without
having to touch the disk.

Hacked_OFF • 4 months ago

This explains how we have been able to be hacked for the last 18 months no matter what we do
in terms of security features in Windows 10. This is actually a design feature inserted by Microsoft
as a back door for the security services, as we have discovered. We strongly suspected this and
now it have been proven. Bloody Hell !!!!, Microsoft software update policy is also designed to
allow the security services to compromise updates... so watch out !!!

Threat signatures are always outdated. Use signed hashes to ensure the integrity of your
system's authorized software.

Have you spoken to anyone at Microsoft about this (i.e. MSRC)?

△ ▽ • Share ›
Tal_Liberman > Robert • 4 months ago

This code injection technique is not dependent on a vulnerability in Microsoft. Rather it
leverages legitimate building blocks of Windows.

So, how to apply this? AtomTable allows only Strings and Integers (based on MS documentation).
So, only aﬀected applications are apps that uses GlobalAtomTable in such a way that allows
bypass some security principles (like storing code in form of string, or path to dll in form of string
etc.). Still it sounds like a problem with applications not with Windows API. Apps should consider
data coming from GlobalAtomTable as untrusted source. Can you name application that is
vulnerable to this ﬂow?

Sounds like a very Interesting research, thank you for sharing it.
I was hoping for more technical details but I guess you have reasons not to reveal them at this
point. Nevertheless, I'm puzzled by your claim that "... the legitimate program, now containing
the malicious code, can be manipulated to execute that code" in conjunction with "the issue
cannot be ﬁxed". Does this mean that telling an application to accept code from an atom table
and execute it is a by-design documented feature? If so, it sounds like a gaping hole that
Microsoft will have to close, but if not, then it sounds like you have found a way to trick it to do so
(which also implies a need for a patch). I'll appreciate more information - thanks!
