The Devil’s in the Details: SUNBURST Attribution
domaintools.com/resources/blog/the-devils-in-the-details-sunburst-attribution

Background
Since initial disclosure in December 2020, the supply chain incident involving SolarWinds
was linked in media reports to Russian intelligence entities, specifically Russia’s Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR). As previously reported by DomainTools, although it appears
multiple government sources link the event to SVR, this has resulted in a type of “transitive”
attribution to link the activity to APT29, also known as Cozy Bear or YTTRIUM, the only
commercially-identified threat actor names linked to Russia’s SVR.
Yet none of the commercial entities responding to events linked SUNBURST malware (or
the wider Solorigate campaign), including FireEye, Microsoft, Volexity, and CrowdStrike, to
SVR-associated APT29. Subsequent US government information on the event, from two
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reports which included no
significant attribution statements, to more recent government statements which only assess
that the responsible entity is “likely Russian in origin” and also do not make the SVR claim.
Initially, the only substantive links to Russian intelligence activity (and SVR specifically)
were through leaks to media organizations, with private security companies largely sitting
the discussion out.

This changed on 11 January 2021 with a report published by Kaspersky. The report
identified functional and code-level overlaps between the SUNBURST backdoor associated
with the SolarWinds infection vector and .NET-based backdoor malware referred to as
Kazuar. Of note, Kazuar activity (which according to Kasperksy’s analysis continued
through December 2020) is only associated with one threat group: an entity referred to as
Turla. The implication from Kaspersky’s nuanced analysis is the possibility that SUNBURST
activity and the Turla group are potentially (although far from conclusively, as noted by
Kaspersky researchers) related.

Who is Turla?
Turla—also referred to as Snake, Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug—is assessed
to have been active in some form since as early as 2004. Known for targeting political,
military, and certain sensitive technology sectors, the group is frequently associated with
complex toolsets and audacious operations such as co-opting satellite internet links for
Command and Control (C2) activity.
Turla is associated with Russian interests and activity but has never been the subject of a
detailed report or authoritative document, such as a US Department of Justice (DoJ)
indictment or similar primary source. Several entities, such as Estonian and Czech
intelligence services, link Turla with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). However,
despite multiple historical reports covering Turla activity from the US National Security
Agency (NSA), CISA (then US-CERT) and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC), such entities only highlight that Turla is “widely reported to be associated with
Russian actors,” avoiding any specific attribution.

While Estonian and Czech assessments cannot be completely discounted, it is notable that
the US and UK governments—which have previously performed very specific attribution on
other Russia-linked entities such as APT28 and Sandworm—abstain from similar
assessments. While a Turla-FSB link is possible, at this time it is not as solid as similar
assessments such as GRU links to APT28 and Sandworm.

Examining Possibilities
The most direct conclusion from Kaspersky’s analysis is that SUNBURST is linked to Turla
operations, which would potentially associate the campaign with Russia’s FSB and not
SVR. However, Kaspersky analysts in both their reporting and social media communication
emphasize that while a SUNBURST-Turla link is possible, this is hardly the only possibility
available. Multiple possibilities exist, which will be discussed below.

Turla Involvement
The first and most direct possibility is that Turla is indeed responsible for the SolarWinds
and related intrusion activity. This would provide a very simple and efficient explanation for
Kaspersky’s findings. Yet, there are problems with this assessment and other data points
which do not support the conclusion.

3/7

For one, there is the FSB (likely, although not definitively, associated with Turla) versus SVR
(indicated by multiple direct sources, including some available to DomainTools, as likely
responsible) distinction. While Turla concrete attribution is hardly complete or definitive,
unlike for other Russia-linked threat actors, the consensus of what limited claims exist focus
on FSB. Meanwhile, multiple sources continue to emphasize that SVR is ultimately
responsible for SUNBURST and related activity. The possibility of a single actor moving
among organizations will be discussed below, but as a one-to-one mapping SUNBURSTTurla linkage seems problematic if we trust multiple government and confidential sources.
Admittedly, the sources in question are not without fault or criticism. The Estonian and
Czech reports linking Turla to FSB cite no evidence of significance and these claims are not
backed up in any other reporting. At the same time, SVR involvement in SUNBURST is
based on no public, documented reporting, but instead derives from leaks to the media and
private (if trusted) conversations. The only public statements by US government entities so
far have emphasized a “likely” Russian nexus without naming a specific entity or alluding to
any industry threat actors.
It is worth noting that Turla is associated with complex, high operational security intrusions
since the group’s initial discovery. As such, a multi-staged, stealthy intrusion such as
SUNBURST and related activity would appear to align with Turla’s operations. However,
follow-on actions in victim environments, including extensive use of credential capture and
replay as well as customized Cobalt Strike functionality as documented by FireEye and
Microsoft, align with behaviors associated with APT29. From a pure tradecraft perspective
then, the evidence is inconclusive.

Contracted Actor Responsible
One possibility, which may explain the code overlap with Turla-linked tooling for a different
actor, would be a shared, contracted developer resource supporting two different entities. In
this scenario, malware developer resources are not dedicated to or housed within a single
entity but instead reside as an external service provided to the actual intrusion set.
If this were used, malware sample code-level and function-level overlaps would be artifacts
of common developer environments and tendencies and would be unrelated to the actual
actors using the tools. Malware-centric threat analysis faces pitfalls and traps in that the
analyzed object represents an artifact or tool used by an adversary, rather than necessarily
an item inherent to the adversary itself.
While a malware-focused threat intelligence approach most obviously faces issues with
tools that are publicly available, open source, or otherwise non-exclusive to specific threat
actors, division of labor in cyber operations means overlaps may occur in otherwise “nonpublic” tooling as well. Under these circumstances, a single developer or developer

4/7

resource is relied upon or hired to support tool development by multiple parties. Based on
coding “quirks” and other tendencies, subtle similarities appear within tools not directly or
critically related to tool functionality.
Unfortunately, this type of attribution is incredibly difficult to prove without having significant
insight into the operations and resource management of threat actors. Yet we cannot
discount the existence of malicious tool creators for hire—or even the possibility of shared
“digital quartermaster” resources supporting disparate teams. If this were true, an overlap
with Turla would be an artifact of such an arrangement while the perpetrators of Solorigate
could represent another operational entity entirely.

Joint Operation
An intriguing scenario surrounding the Solorigate activity in general and SUNBURST
deployment in particular would be a joint or divided operation. In this scenario, the cyber kill
chain is not executed or managed by a monolithic entity. Instead, different elements are
operationally responsible for different stages of operations, with separate “access,”
“intrusion,” and “execution” teams taking on specific roles.
If this were to hold as valid, Turla-linked capabilities in SUNBURST may be an artifact of
Turla—a known, capable intrusion actor—having responsibility for initial access operations
to victim networks. Meanwhile, follow-on exploitation and lateral movement are handed over
to another team, with its own methods, tools, and tradecraft for carrying out operations.
As described previously, SUNBURST appears to at least superficially resemble Turla-linked
capabilities and operations, while post-exploitation activity seems more closely linked to
behaviors associated with APT29. Such divergence may not be an anomaly, but actually
represent two distinct teams involved in the same operation.
While limited, public information links these activities to two distinct parts of Russia’s
intelligence community (FSB and SVR, respectively), the possibility of these two
organizations working together or in complementary fashion may be unlikely, but not
outside the bounds of possibility. Both derive from the same ancestor organization—the
Committee for State Security (KGB)—and have identical reporting and chain of command
structures under the Russian President’s Council. That these organizations—typically
divided between mostly (although not exclusively) internal (FSB) and external (SVR)
operations—might collaborate makes more sense than either organization working in
concert with Russia’s other major intelligence entity, the military’s Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU).
Although provocative, this theory would require significantly greater amounts of evidence to
support it. Additional tools or capabilities representing initial access vectors, similar to
SUNBURST, and further details on follow-on capabilities and exploitation would be
necessary to have adequate information to justify delineating operations between distinct

5/7

entities. Nonetheless, we cannot simply dismiss this as a possibility, and we as cyber threat
intelligence analysts should be wary of assuming all operations are “unitary” in nature
instead of composite operations divided among specialist teams.

“False Flag” Operation
The overlaps with Turla-associated functionality in SUNBURST may represent an effort by
the threat actor to throw off attribution through a “false flag,” misdirection operation. As
documented by other researchers, Solorigate and related events may map to completely
different threats previously noted for highly-targeted supply chain activities.
Yet on closer examination, although still possible, this seems less probable. For one,
SUNBURST and related activity operated at a relatively obscure level of program
functionality or tendencies such that it took a third-party, not known to be engaged in any
active investigations in victim environments, to make the connection through very detailed
malware reverse engineering. While one could claim such efforts are part of an
exceptionally savvy, operationally secure operation, this level of effort and the non-obvious
similarities (compared to, say, the ultimately obvious “tells” embedded within the Olympic
Destroyer event) would appear to indicate otherwise. The ability to make this (still tenuous)
link to Turla relies upon recognition of non-obvious, technically obtuse overlaps between
SUNBURST and Kazuar code, making this a very difficult and potentially unreliable
mechanism to divert blame to another party.
Second, while the quality of existing sourcing has already been described as less than ideal
with respect to Solorigate attribution, it remains that multiple US government agencies have
publicly declared that Russia-linked entities are “likely” responsible for the event. While we
may decry lack of additional detail and technical indicators making this case more complete,
that such agencies would go public with such a proclamation in itself indicates a level of
confidence in the assessment which is probably higher than the “likely” modifier attached to
it.
Certainly a “we’re from the government, trust us” stance is problematic and less than ideal,
but overall there are no significant examples of public US attribution statements ultimately
being proved completely or disastrously wrong. In fact, previous work—such as that
identifying Turla as having compromised APT34 to further Turla campaigns—indicates the
US and UK governments are able to unpack false flag events when they occur. Therefore,
although less than ideal, the declaration from CISA, NSA, the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) should give us
as analysts pause before we engage in equally unfounded “whataboutism” in declaring that
SUNBURST may be a false flag operation executed by an entity such as APT41.

Coincidence

6/7

Finally, the items in question identified by Kaspersky may ultimately be the result of
coincidence. Programmatic overlaps may be the result of developers having similar
instructors, viewing the same support forums, or arriving at similar conclusions to similar
problems. Short of additional evidence supporting a link to Turla for SUNBURST
development, we as analysts may remain with only this perspective as a means to explain
why SUNBURST overlapped with Kazuar in subtle, but nonetheless noticeable to the
trained eye, ways.
Although disappointing and unexciting, this explanation may prove to be the most likely
reason for such overlaps to occur. Yet the underlying reasons giving rise to these
coincidences—programming similarities and other oddities—may indicate similar
backgrounds or developer methodologies between Kazuar and SUNBURST even if
operationally the items are used by completely distinct entities. Such an insight may cast an
interesting light upon malware developer tendencies and similar observables, even if this
does not lend any further detail to who is responsible for SUNBURST’s deployment.

Conclusion
Investigation into the Solorigate activity, including its components such as SUNBURST and
recently-disclosed SUNSPOT, remains ongoing. As noted by researchers from Kaspersky,
more evidence is required before linking the activity to any known, tracked entity, although
the technical analysis provided indicates subtle, tantalizing links to historical actors.
Nonetheless, we as cyber threat analysts and network defenders must remain skeptical,
and process alternatives to the identified activity to ensure we do not engage in
assumptions or similar intellectual shortcuts that may disadvantage future investigations.
Overall, the process of specific attribution remains an exceptionally difficult task when
dealing with less than complete information or viewing an intrusion from an external
perspective. While the Solorigate activity and components such as SUNBURST and
SUNSPOT are items of intense scrutiny and interest at this time, accurate attribution may
depend on additional information gathering and leveraging non-cyber sources to clear up
certain doubts and remaining questions. As a result, although this is frustrating on many
levels to CTI professionals, we likely will be waiting months, if not years, before identifying
additional information necessary to learn who is precisely responsible for this event within
the current landscape of threat actors. This is not to say that such a task is impossible, but
rather to emphasize the need for patience, dispassionate analysis, and continual
information gathering to ensure accuracy.
