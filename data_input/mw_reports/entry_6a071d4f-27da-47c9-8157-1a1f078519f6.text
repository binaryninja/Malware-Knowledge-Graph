Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Associated
with Malware within Chinese GovernmentMandated Tax Software
Summary
On 23 July 2020, the FBI disseminated the FLASH message “Chinese
Government-Mandated Tax Software Contains Malware, Enabling
Backdoor Access” (AC-000129-TT) after the FBI observed reporting of
malware distributed through Chinese Government-mandated tax software.
FLASH message AC-000129-TT provided several indicators of compromise
(IOCs) and a summary of security risks associated with the “Golden Tax
System” tax software.
The FBI is disseminating this FLASH message based on the identification of
additional IOCs and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated
with the malware. The FBI advises all organizations conducting business in
China to review FLASH message AC-000129-TT. Observed TTPs associated
with the malware can be mapped to the MITRE1 Adversarial Tactics,
Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK2) for Enterprise framework,
Version 7.0.

Threat
Following the recent disclosure of the GoldenSpy malware, cyber actors have made determined efforts to
remove the malware from victim networks. Each subsequent attempt to remove the malware involves
increasing levels of obfuscation and detection avoidance techniques in an effort to evade newly
implemented network security rules. This reveals the actors’ high level of sophistication and operational
awareness. The software service providers have not provided a statement acknowledging the software
supply chain compromise. The FBI assesses that the cyber actors’ persistent attempts to silently remove the
malware is not a sign of resignation. Rather, it is an effort to hide their capabilities. Organizations
conducting business in China continue to be at risk from system vulnerabilities exploited by the tax software
and similar supply chains.

Please see the attached document for additional indicators of compromise.
Recommended Mitigations
 Evaluate risk exposure and security considerations associated with conducting business in China and
when using third-party software.
 Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching of Internet-connected servers for
known vulnerabilities and software processing Internet data, such as web browsers, browser plugins, and
document readers.
 Actively scan and monitor web applications for unauthorized access, modification, and anomalous
activities.
 Strengthen credential requirements and implement multi-factor authentication to protect individual
accounts, particularly for webmail and VPN access and for accounts that access critical systems.
 Change passwords and do not reuse passwords for multiple accounts.
 Recommend developing a network baseline to allow for the identification of anomalous account activity.
Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity (see attachment for guidance).
 Network device management interfaces, such as Telnet, SSH, Winbox, and HTTP, should be turned off for
WAN interfaces and secured with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Identify and suspend
access of users exhibiting unusual activity.
 When possible, segment critical information on air-gapped systems. Use strict access control measures
for critical data. Be mindful of new and existing cyber infrastructure for work and bioscience
collaborations.
