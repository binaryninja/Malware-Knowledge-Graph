Ransomware

A new blocker called nRansom locks users out of their computers and demands not money,
but nude pictures.

Ransomware has been called the scourge of the Internet for quite a while. It’s really one of
the twenty-first century’s main cyberthreats, and recently it has taken … quite a turn.
Researchers from MalwareHunterTeam have discovered a new strain of ransomware, called
nRansom, that blocks victims’ computers, but instead of requiring money to unlock the
computer, it demands nude photos.

This ransomware seems to be not a cryptor, but rather a blocker, which means that in case
of infection it doesn’t encrypt your files, but simply blocks access to your computer. The
ransom note that appears on the screen informs victims that the only way to get back access
to their computers is to send the aforementioned pictures: ten of them, nude, and
demonstrably of the victims.
They state that they will somehow verify those nudes really belong to the victim before
sending the code that unlocks the computer.

At this point, nRansom has been seen only as a file called nRansom.exe, which means it
affects only Windows users.
We can only speculate on what the criminals are planning to do with any photos they
manage to get. They’ll probably use the pictures to shame the victims and extort either more
nudes or money.
As always, we advise you not to pay the ransom if your computer gets infected. The word
“pay” in this case is as legitimate as in any other; private information is no less payment than
money.
Kaspersky Internet Security detects nRansom as Trojan-Ransom.MSIL.Agent.zz and
neutralizes it right away. In case the blocker has somehow sneaked onto your PC, you can
unblock the computer by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F4 simultaneously. It’s necessary to run
a full scan of your system after that. You can read more about that here.
That technique is available in all of our flagship security solutions, and it works against all
blockers, in case they somehow get onto your computer. However, if you always keep
protection running, that scenario is highly unlikely; Kaspersky Internet Security neutralizes
almost all ransomware species before they can do anything at all, and any that manage to
sneak in under the radar are detected by System Watcher when they attempt to do anything
malicious.
