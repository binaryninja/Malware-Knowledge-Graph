Phish Found in Environments Protected by SEGs
Cisco Ironport
By Ashley Tran, Cofense Phishing Defense Center
The Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) team has identified a phishing
campaign that attempts to harvest Webex credentials. This is not the first time we have seen
an active Webex campaign, however, as we have noted before. It is actually an attack
method that became increasingly common as non-essential workers were pushed into
remote working conditions due to the pandemic. The previous Webex phish utilized

implications of vulnerabilities and SSL certificate fixes for Webex, but this one takes a more
subtle approach: acting as a Webex event invite.

Figure 1: Email Body
The email shown in Figure 1 looks like a relatively normal Webex event invite at a glance.
This email is a simple Webex invite that anyone who uses Webex may be accustomed to.
This invite says that the user has been invited to the event “Leadership&Muscles,” the host is
“Online Leader” and, although it is vague, the mentions of “Leadership” and “Online Leader”

may have most users determine this has to do with work and – without typical phishing
language urging them to join – many may not feel so threatened; they may opt to join the
meeting out of curiosity.
And should a user think to hover-check the button to “join a meeting,” the URL that will show
as a preview will be: hxxp://idbrokerwebex[.]com
Despite the threat actor’s attempts to make this email seem legitimate, however, the subject
of the email already appears off compared to what is seen in the body – a Portuguese
subject paired with an English body? If that does not reveal the true nature of this email then
the threat actor’s carelessness with the From and Sender fields will. Although it is obvious
there was an attempt to make the email appear as though it is coming from Webex with the
inclusion of “[email protected],” the real sender email is next to it:
americacentral02[@]eliteddi[.]com.
Looking into the domain eliteddi.com, we can see that it was recently registered, as seen in
Figure 2.

This was perhaps done in a bid to give themselves a domain to use for sending emails.
When utilizing their own registered domains, this gives the threat actor a legitimate DKIM,
SPF and DMARC to bypass resources. This domain was presumably also used as practice
in setting up this attack because, as noted in Figure 3, the domain is also the host to the

same Webex phish. Because the domain eliteddi[.]com is not part of the actual email itself,
and isn’t actually a part that a user would typically interact with, it can be assumed that this
domain was part of the threat actor’s practice attempt before launching this attack.

Figure 3: Webex phish found on the sender domain eliteddi[.]com
Taking a look at the URL found embedded into the email itself we can see that this URL
looks much more legitimate than the one seen in the threat actor’s practice attempts. This
fraudulent domain was also recently registered according to information found on its
corresponding WhoIs record, as seen in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Domain information for idbrokerwebex[.]com
One thing to note for this fraudulent domain is that the threat actor has tried to mimic a
real Webex URL, one that is typically just a quick redirect when logging into Webex Teams,
but would still be a familiar site to users. The small difference between the legitimate and the
phishing URLs, though, is a simple “.” separating idbroker from webex – a small mistaken
mistype of a user trying to get to this domain can lead to a huge mistake in this case.
The phish itself can be noted in Figure 2.

Figure 5-6: Phishing Page
The Webex phish similar to this has utilized the same template when phishing for
credentials, essentially a perfect copy of Webex’s login page. This page does not have any
noticeable flaws in grammar anywhere or weird formatting. In fact, even the URL in the
address bar does not give anything away immediately should a user glance at it for any sort
of validation.

Compared to the phishing page seen hosted on the threat actor’s “practice” domain noted
above, this one actually has a certificate for the site that, in turn, adds a lock in the address
bar which, to most, indicates that a site is “secure.” This is a relatively common addition,
especially with the use of website builders that give creators a certificate to work
with. However, as noted numerous times in other blogs, threat actors are using
that perception to trick users into trusting their phishing attacks.
The second step of this attack can be noted in Figures 7-8. This step acts more as a
distraction mechanism, as the page looks like any other Webex event registration page. Here
the user would input any amount of information as long as the fields are required, then move
on to the final confirmation page. While this page is more than likely just an attempt to put
any suspicions the user had initially to rest, this page also has the potential to garner more
information about the user.
