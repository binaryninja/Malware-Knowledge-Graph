#StopRansomware: MedusaLocker
SUMMARY
Note: this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of
an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish
advisories for network defenders that detail various
ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors.
These #StopRansomware advisories include recently
and historically observed tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit
stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware
advisories and to learn more about other ransomware
threats and no-cost resources.

Actions to take today to mitigate
cyber threats from ransomware:
•

Prioritize remediating known
exploited vulnerabilities.

•

Train users to recognize and
report phishing attempts.

•

Enable and enforce multifactor
authentication (MFA).

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), the Department of the Treasury, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
are releasing this CSA to provide information on MedusaLocker ransomware. Observed as recently
as May 2022, MedusaLocker actors predominantly rely on vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) to access victims’ networks. The MedusaLocker actors encrypt the victim’s data and leave a
ransom note with communication instructions in every folder containing an encrypted file. The note
directs victims to provide ransomware payments to a specific Bitcoin wallet address. MedusaLocker
appears to operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model based on the observed split of
ransom payments. Typical RaaS models involve the ransomware developer and various affiliates that
deploy the ransomware on victim systems. MedusaLocker ransomware payments appear to be
consistently split between the affiliate, who receives 55 to 60 percent of the ransom, and the
developer, who receives the remainder.
To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your
local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices. When available, please include the following information
regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of
equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact.
To report incidents and anomalous activity or to request incident response resources or technical assistance related to
this threat, contact CISA at report@cisa.gov.
Disclaimer: the information in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory is provided “"as is” for informational purposes only.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
MedusaLocker ransomware actors most often gain access to victim devices through vulnerable
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations [T1133]. Actors also frequently use email phishing
and spam email campaigns—directly attaching the ransomware to the email—as initial intrusion
vectors [T1566].
MedusaLocker ransomware uses a batch file to execute PowerShell script invokeReflectivePEInjection [T1059.001]. This script propagates MedusaLocker throughout the network
by editing the EnableLinkedConnections value within the infected machine’s registry, which then
allows the infected machine to detect attached hosts and networks via Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) and to detect shared storage via Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol.
MedusaLocker then:
•

Restarts the LanmanWorkstation service, which allows registry edits to take effect.

•

Kills the processes of well-known security, accounting, and forensic software.

•

Restarts the machine in safe mode to avoid detection by security software [T1562.009].

•

Encrypts victim files with the AES-256 encryption algorithm; the resulting key is then
encrypted with an RSA-2048 public key [T1486].

•

Runs every 60 seconds, encrypting all files except those critical to the functionality of the
victim’s machine and those that have the designated encrypted file extension.

•

Establishes persistence by copying an executable (svhost.exe or svhostt.exe) to the
%APPDATA%\Roaming directory and scheduling a task to run the ransomware every 15
minutes.

•

Attempts to prevent standard recovery techniques by deleting local backups, disabling startup
recovery options, and deleting shadow copies [T1490].

MedusaLocker actors place a ransom note into every folder containing a file with the victim's
encrypted data. The note outlines how to communicate with the MedusaLocker actors, typically
providing victims one or more email address at which the actors can be reached. The size of
MedusaLocker ransom demands appears to vary depending on the victim’s financial status as
perceived by the actors.

MITIGATIONS
•

•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Implement a recovery plan that maintains and retains multiple copies of sensitive or
proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e.,
hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).
Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure limited
interruption to the organization.
Regularly back up data and password protect backup copies stored offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data
resides.
Install, regularly update, and enable real-time detection for antivirus software on all hosts.
Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as possible.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or
unrecognized accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to
the principle of least privilege.
Disable unused ports.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).
Use National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing and
managing password policies:
o Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64
characters in length.
o Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.
o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.
o Avoid reusing passwords.
o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.
o Disable password “hints.”
o Refrain from requiring password changes unless there is evidence of password
compromise.
Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords and no longer require
regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to
result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.
o Require administrator credentials to install software.
Only use secure networks; avoid using public Wi-Fi networks.
Consider installing and using a virtual private network (VPN) to establish secure remote
connections.
Focus on cybersecurity awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on
information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks
and vulnerabilities, such as ransomware and phishing scams.
