Executive Summary:
LockBit has been implicated as the most active ransomware and has been involved in
the most attacks compared to others of its kind.
LockBit emerged in September 2019 functioning as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS).
Since then it evolved into LockBit2.0 as a variant of the original LockBit ransomware
gang.
During this time, the gang started a double extortion model.
Currently running as LockBit3.0, or LockBit Black, the ransomware gang is actively
targeting multiple sectors, most commonly banking, financial services, and insurance
(BFSI).
LockBit shares behaviors with MegaCortex and LockerGoga. It is self-spreading,
targeted, and uses similar tools.
The largest case of LockBit includes Accenture in August 2021 which stole 6 terabytes
of data and demanded $50 million in ransom.
LockBit 3.0 announced its own bug bounty program to let security researchers and
hackers alike find flaws in their projects and infrastructure hosted on the dark web.

What is LockBit?
LockBit, formerly known as “ABCD” ransomware due to the conversion of encrypted files to
the “.abcd” extension is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) malware. The threat actors have
been updating this ransomware features and capabilities since it was first detected in
September 2019. It also advertised itself as the fastest ransomware to encrypt files. It shares
some similarities with Darkside/black matter ransomware, uses passwords to run like
blackcat/aplhv, and is believed to be part of the LockerGoga & MegaCortex family.
LockBit’s family of ransomware is known to be self-spreading, yet has been found targeting
specific companies that are able to pay a large ransom.

The LockBit creators offer access to the ransomware program and its infrastructure to thirdparty hackers known as affiliates, who break into networks and install it on systems in
exchange for a cut of up to 75% of the ransom paid by victims. LockBit, like most similar
RaaS gangs, employ double extortion tactics in which its associates exfiltrate data from
victim organizations and threaten to disclose it online.
According to research by ransomware incident response provider Coveware, LockBit was
responsible for 15% of ransomware assaults seen in the first quarter of 2022, trailing only
Conti with 16%. According to a more recent assessment, LockBit was responsible for 40% of
the ransomware assaults seen by NCC Group in May, followed by Conti.
While the overall number of ransomware incidents has decreased in recent months, the
percentage that LockBit accounts for is likely to rise, partly because the Conti operation is
believed to have shut down or splintered into smaller groups, and partly because LockBit is
attempting to attract more affiliates by claiming to offer better terms than competitors.

Origin and Evolution
LockBit has evolved from the early days of ABCD. The RaaS affiliate program was released
in early 2020, followed by the data leak site and the addition of data leak extortion later that
year.
During its first year of operation, LockBit remained a minor participant, with other high-profile
gangs—Ryuk, REvil, Maze, and others—being more successful and in the spotlight. With the
release of LockBit 2.0 and after some of the other gangs shut down their activities due to too
2/8

much pressure, the LockBit ransomware gained traction in the second half of 2021.
According to researchers from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, LockBit 2.0 was “the most
impactful and widely deployed ransomware variant we have observed in all ransomware
breaches during the first quarter of 2022, considering both leak site data and data from
cases handled by Unit 42 incident responders.” The group’s LockBit 2.0 site, which it uses to
publish data from corporations whose networks it has infiltrated, names 850 victims, but the
gang claims to have ransomed over 12,125 firms so far.
The group also claims that the LockBit 2.0 ransomware has the quickest encryption
procedure, which according to Splunk researchers is only partially true. LockBit 1.0 and the
ransomware program PwndLocker appear to be faster than LockBit 2.0, but the encryption
process is still quite fast, thanks in part to the fact that these threats use partial encryption.
LockBit 2.0, for example, encrypts only the first 4KB of each file, rendering it unreadable and
unusable while also allowing the attack to finish quickly before incident responders have time
to shut down systems and isolate them from the network.
Researchers have found connections between the current LockBit ransomware variant and
BlackMatter, a rebranded form of the DarkSide ransomware strain that shut down in
November 2021.
LockBit 3.0, also known as LockBit Black, was released in June 2022, including a new leak
site and the world’s first ransomware bug bounty program, with Zcash cryptocurrency as a
payment option.
It encrypts each file by appending the extension “HLJkNskOq” or “19MqZqZ0s” and changes
the icons of the locked files to the “.ico” file dropped by the LockBit sample to initiate the
infection.

Who is LockBit targeting?
According to BlackFog’s most recent “Ransomware Trend Report,” there is a renewed
emphasis on weaker targets, such as education (33% increase), government (25%
increase), and manufacturing (24% increase).
Attacks in June on the University of Pisa (which paid a $4.5 million ransom), Brooks County
in Texas (which paid a $37,000 ransom with taxpayer money), and the Cape Cod Regional
Transit Authority all demonstrate this.
In total, 31 publicly publicized ransomware incidents were recorded by BlackFog in June.
Matt Hull, NCC Group’s worldwide lead for strategic threat intelligence, finally pointed to
“major changes” in the ransomware threat landscape, adding that “it is evident we are in a
transitory phase.”

“This is an ever-changing landscape that must be constantly evaluated,” he said.
According to data from LockBit’s data leak site, nearly half of the victim organizations were
from the United States, followed by Italy, Germany, Canada, France, and the United
Kingdom. According to the LockBit gang member in the previous interview, the concentration
on North American and European firms is owing to a larger prevalence of cyber insurance as
well as higher profits in these regions. Professional and legal services, construction, the
federal government, real estate, retail, high tech, and manufacturing have been the most
impacted industry verticals. The malware also includes code that stops it from being
executed on PCs configured with Eastern European language settings.
Based on tweets by @VX-underground Twitter bot @RansomwareNews from May 17 to
September 221, LockBit accounted for twice as much as its closest competitor, BlackBastaa,
Aplhv/BlackCat, Hiveleak, and clop.

It should also be noted that the LockBit gang has created a separate malware application
called StealBit that can be used to automate data exfiltration. This tool uploads the data
directly to LockBit’s servers rather than using public file hosting sites, which may erase the
data in response to victim complaints. The group has also created the LockBit Linux-ESXi
Locker, which can encrypt Linux servers and VMware ESXi virtual machines.
LockBit attackers spent roughly 70 days within a network before releasing the ransomware in
Q4 2021, 35 days in Q1 2022, and fewer than 20 days in Q2 2022. This means that
enterprises have less time to detect network attacks in their early stages and prevent
ransomware deployment. According to Palo Alto Networks, the attackers’ willingness to

bargain and lessen the ransom sum has also decreased. Last year, the attackers were
willing to reduce the ransom sum by more than 80%, but currently, victims may only expect a
30% price drop on average.

LockBit Operations
After obtaining initial access to networks, LockBit affiliates deploy various tools to expand
their access to other systems. These tools involve credential dumpers like Mimikatz; privilege
escalation tools like ProxyShell, tools used to disable security products and various
processes such as GMER, PC Hunter, and Process Hacker; network and port scanners to
identify active directory domain controllers, remote execution tools like PsExec or Cobalt
Strike for lateral movement. The activity also involves the use of obfuscated PowerShell and
batch scripts and rogue scheduled tasks for persistence.

Once deployed, the LockBit ransomware can also spread to other systems via SMB
connections using collected credentials as well as by using Active Directory group policies.
When executed, the ransomware will disable Windows volume shadow copies and delete
various system and security logs.
The malware then collects system information such as hostname, domain information, local
drive configuration, remote shares, and mounted storage devices then will start encrypting all
data on the local and remote devices it can access. After encrypting all the files LockBit also
changes the file’s icon with their icon.
After the registry entry is created then the icon from the “C:\ProgramData” is loaded in the
registry value. When the encryption process of a file is completed then the icons of files are
changed to the icon present in the above mention registry key.

ransom note by changing the user’s desktop wallpaper with information on how to contact
the attackers.
