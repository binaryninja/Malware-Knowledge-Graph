Through continuous cyber security monitoring, VinCSS has discovered a document
containing malicious code with Vietnamese content that was found by ShadowChaser
Group(@ShadowChasing1) group. We think, this is maybe a cyberattack campaign that was
targeted in Vietnam, we have downloaded the sample file. Through a quick assessment, we
discovered some interesting points about this sample, so we decided to analyze it. This is
the first part in a series of articles analyzing this sample.

File Name: Thông cáo báo chí Kỳ họp thứ nhất của Ủy ban Kiểm tra Trung ương khóa
XIII.docx
SHA-256:
6f66faf278b5e78992362060d6375dcc2006bcee29ccc19347db27a250f81bcd
File size: 23.51 KB (24072 bytes)
File type: Office Open XML Document
Extracting this .docx file and examining the extracted .xml files, we discovered that this
.docx file was created and modified on Kingsoft Office software, which is a popular word
processing and document creation in China.

1/7

We found KSOProductBuildVer = 2052-11.1.0.10228. Search by this value, we guess it
could be Kingsoft Office 2019 version.

Continue analyzing file with olevba tool:

With olevba’s results, it can be seen that this document applies Template Injection technique.

The advantage of this technique is that when the user open the file, it will automatically
download the Main.jpg file from the address hxxp://45[.]121[.]146[.]88/Apricot/Main.jpg.

2/7

Up to the time of our analysis, the Main.jpg file is still downloadable:

Main.jpg is an RTF file:

According to our analysis experience, these RTF files are often used to exploit vulnerabilities
in Equation Editor. Check the file with rtfobj:

3/7

Based on the results in above picture , we can determine that when executing the Main.jpg
file, it will drop the 5.t file into the %Temp% directory, through exploiting the vulnerability in
the Equation Editor to execute the shellcode, and then decode 5.t and execute this file. At
this point, there are two methods to decode 5.t:
Method 1: use rr_decoder.
Use rtfobj to extract 5.t.

Use rr_decode.py for decoding to get payload:

Method 2: Let’s the malware to perform its task by opening the RTF file, it will decrypt
the 5.t payload and create a scheduled task to execute this file:

Check the decrypted file
(d198c4d82eba42cc3ae512e4a1d4ce85ed92f3e5fdff5c248acd7b32bd46dc75), this is a dll
file with the original name Download.dll. This file has only one exported function which is
StartW:

Through examining the Download.dll file, we see it was built with Visual Studio 2019, linker
version 14.28. TimeDateStamp at build time is Thursday, 01.04.2021 01:59:48 UTC. This
value is consistent in TimeDateStamp in FileHeader and Debug Info, type ILTCG.

5/7

RichID information identified that the version of Visual Studio 2019 that the hacker is using is
16.8. The current version of Visual Studio 2019 is 16.9(.6).

During the analysis of this Download.dll file, we discovered indicators of the same code
base, reused from a previous campaign of an APT Panda group that was targeted in
Vietnam. The decoy document of that campaign is Dt-CT-cua-TTg.doc. Dt-CT-cua-TTg.doc
file is also an RTF file, which also takes advantage of Equation's bug to execute shellcode
and drop the first stage payload. For more information please read here.
In the next part, we will analyze Download.dll file in detail, showing the similarities in the
source code in this file and other PE files in the later payloads of the above campaign
analysis.
