In October 2015, Talos released our detailed investigation of the Angler Exploit Kit which
outlined the infrastructure and monetary impact of an exploit kit campaign delivering
ransomware. During the investigation we found that two thirds of Angler's payloads were
some variation of ransomware and noted one of the other major payloads was Bedep.
Bedep is a malware downloader that is exclusive to Angler. This post will discuss the Bedep
side of Angler and draw some pretty clear connections between Angler and Bedep.
Adversaries continue to evolve and have become increasingly good at hiding the
connections to the nefarious activities in which they are involved. As security researchers
we are always looking for the bread crumbs that can link these threats together to try and
identify the connections and groups that operate. This is one of those instances were a
couple of crumbs came together and formed some unexpected connections. By tying
together a couple of registrant accounts, email addresses, and domain activity Talos was

1/12

able to track down a group that has connections to threats on multiple fronts including:
exploit kits, trojans, email worms, and click fraud. These activities all have monetary value,
but are difficult to quantify unlike a ransomware payload with a specific cost to decrypt.

Back in the 0-Day
Let's start a little more than a year ago with the Angler Flash 0-day
(CVE-2015-0310). It's not the 0-day that's of interest. Instead, it's the
group that was hosting it. This was around the time when Angler
began distribution via Domain Shadowing, accounting for the
majority of domain activity hosting Angler. Domain Shadowing is
the process of leveraging hacked registrant accounts to host
malicious activity under subdomains. It started with Angler and has
propagated through most exploit kits. What was interesting about
the Flash 0-day was that it initially wasn't being hosted using
shadowed domains. Instead, it was using registered domains. A
sample of the domains being used can be found below.

During the investigation, we began looking deeper at these domains and found that they
were all registered under a single email address: yingw90@yahoo.com. At this point Talos
was already blocklisting the domains associated with this registrant account and began
tracking it accordingly.

Angler Research
Let's fast forward to the months leading up to our report published
in October 2015. Talos gathered landing page URLs as well as URLs
associated with the rest of the Angler infection chain. We looked at
additional ways to group and slice the data specifically associated
with landing pages. While inspecting the length of the parameters
we found something interesting. For 90% of the landing pages, we

2/12

found the parameters were less than 50 characters in length. The
payloads associated with this 90% varied quite considerably, but
was predominantly ransomware.
We found a group of ~10% that had a parameter around 100 characters. That was a
significant deviation from what would be considered "normal" parameter length. We began
then looking at the payloads and found that every instance we traced that had a parameter
of greater than 100, was delivering Bedep. There are some interesting implications here. Is
it possible that the instance or instances delivering Bedep are different from the instances
delivering additional payloads?
This became an even stronger possibility when we started finding double Angler infections.
It started with users being compromised by Angler and getting an initial payload of Bedep.
This was followed up with, command and control or C2 communication and a download of
click fraud software. This is normal behavior for Bedep. However there was an additional
step. At some point after the infection we began seeing users being directed to other Angler
instances. These systems were delivering other payloads, most commonly ransomware
variants. These seemed to point further to the Angler instances delivering Bedep are
different from those delivering other payloads. Why would one Angler user direct their
compromised users to other Angler instances?
We've mentioned multiple times the Bedep C2 communication, the next section will focus
on Bedep. Below are some samples of the domains we started to encounter.

Bedep
This is obviously using a domain generating algorithm, or DGA. It's
been documented that Bedep makes use of the exchange rates
being hosted by the European Central Bank, as one of the seeds for
the DGA, which is an indicator of Bedep infection. If investigating a
potential Angler infection and a GET request to www.ecb.europa.eu

3/12

is observed there is a high probability the sytem was compromised
with Bedep. We had a large list of DGA based domains and found
our first interesting connection.

The majority of the C2 domains were registered to the same registrant. This registrant also
held all of the domains that were first seen hosting the Flash 0-day. There is a basic pattern
for Bedep C2: the DGA domains for that particular day are registered, they are active while
users connect to them, and then go dark. We profiled these sites and found that they use
the same "stock" webpage. A sample of the web page is shown below:

This is a unique "stock" webpage with an image of pills in the header and a section of links
in the body. In general these links do not go anywhere redirecting back to this main page.

Rabbit Hole Referers
The analysis continued with a focus on the referer data with a
couple of interesting discoveries. They have been labeled as "rabbit
hole referers" because they led us down a rabbit hole of domains,
IPs, and compromise. This lead us to the threat actor(s) responsible
for a significant amount of Angler activity and a close link to the
Bedep downloader.

First, Talos noticed a set of referers that were using a group of domains that resembled
news4newsXXXX.com where XXXX is some variant of year (i.e. 14, 15, 2014, 2015).
Leveraging OpenDNS, Talos found that a single registrant account was responsible for all
these domains. One interesting thing to note is the use of BizCN registrar. There has been
information around various other exploit kits using BizCN registered domains as a gate.
This could be yet another exploit kit making use of the same type of service.

Talos viewed these web pages and they appear to be a normal news site, a sample of
which is shown below.

However, whenever Angler redirection was found, there were a couple of interesting
features. First, the syntax used was similar to the following:

5/12

news4news14[.]com/?source=7-381898&campaign_id=2849
This syntax indicates it may be part of a malvertising campaign based on the campaign_id
variable. However, browsing to something as simple as 'news4news14.com/?q=junk', the
user was directed to an Angler URL with no malicious data served. The second interesting
feature relates to the sites that referred to news4newsXXX.com. There were a large number
of referers that appeared to be using some sort of search function to direct users. However,
Talos was not able to find any legitimate traffic to these domains. It appeared to be
exclusively used as a referrer. Talos dove deeper on two of these referrers in particular:
dinorinwass[.]com/search.php
wittalparuserigh[.]com
Again, leveraging OpenDNS, Talos was able to identify more information regarding the first
domain.

The registrant email address potrafamin44as@gmail.com was then used to gather
information from DomainTools. This led Talos to a name of 'David Bowers' that had a
significant amount of domains registered to them, as well as, a list of other domains that
OpenDNS had categorized as malicious from potrafamin44as@gmail.com. We were also
able to pull a screen capture of the default webpage for this site. The results are familiar,
but not identical to the other sites. This site makes use of notes in the top left of the header
as opposed to the pills present in the other examples.

6/12

Research into some of these domains turned up some interesting results. Talos found that
this particular registrant account was also tied to domains associated with other threats
including Bedep, Kazy, Symmi, and Chir mail worm. The registrant held domains that are
closely related to those Trojans. As far as its relation to Bedep, we found DGA domains
registered to this registrant, as well as domains hosting click-fraud ads. Below are samples
of the requests to the DGA as well as a GET request for one of the ads.

Sample Bedep DGA

Sample Click Fraud Ad
The name 'David Bowers' became increasingly important when looking through the
domains associated with yingw90@yahoo.com. It turns out that the same name and
address are being used for a portion of domains associated with yingw90@yahoo.com.

7/12

The other referer that kept showing up repeatedly was wittalparuserigh[.]com. The
interesting part was that we could find numerous instances where that site was a referer to
one of the news4news sites, but we could not find a single instance of a user browsing to
that page or any subpage directly. At this point, we were curious about the actual redirecting
web page contents, so we went to the URL and found:

That image should look familiar. It is an exact copy of the all the webpages that were found
on the sites running the C2 for Bedep. The data pointed to a connection to
yingw90@yahoo.com. The next step was to start investigating wittalparuserigh[.]com.

However, as shown above, we did not find any reference to yingw90@yahoo.com. Instead
we found a different email address associated with the domain. Next we looked at what
additional domains were registered with this email address. This user had a interesting mix

8/12

of websites including normal looking domains, DGA-like domains, and adult websites. It's
hard to imagine this user could be linked to Angler using the same default web page as the
Bedep C2 sites and not have some connection.

Taking these domains and running a quick search in ThreatGrid found matches for some of
the domains. Additional analysis shows that this account's domains are tied to multiple
different threats, such as a Necurs Variant, Kazy, and Lurk.

Recap
Let's pause for a minute and recap all that has been discussed to
this point. It started a year ago with the Adobe Flash 0-Day that was
incorporated into Angler (CVE-2015-0310). The infrastructure used
to deliver the Flash 0-day exploit led Talos to a series of domains

9/12

that were not shadowed and registered to a single email address
(yingw90@yahoo.com). Talos then started investigating these
various leads and ended up with a group of three email addresses:

There is one final note here. While Talos was continuing its research, @Kafeine posted a
story about 'XXX' or the true name of the Angler exploit kit. In this post, there was a
discussion regarding one of the original Angler users --the indexm.html instance. While
looking at the information we noticed something very interesting, some of the domains
pointed back to this same email yingw90@yahoo.com.

Angler Exploit Server Visibility
Moving back to the recent research of Angler. The image below
should look familiar. It is the diagram illustrating the infrastructure
we exposed.

After our research was published, Talos was able to get some information regarding the
communications of an Angler exploit server. This included repeated connections on TCP
port 225 from the exploit server to another host. This port is actually a reserved IANA port,
but in this case was being used as an HTTP server with basic authentication.

This connection was made repeatedly and each time returned an executable, with a
different hash, that was being used to deliver content to the compromised user. This
appeared to be the system that was delivering payloads to the users. The payload host was
specified in the HTTP transactions, but was not accompanied by DNS requests. We
immediately began looking at this host and found an overlap.

The domain specified in the HTTP requests to the Exploit Server is owned by the same
registrant account that was redirecting users to Angler landing pages with a web site using
the "stock" Bedep C2 web page. This brought the data full circle and cemented the link
between Angler and Bedep.

Conclusion
The organizations responsible for these exploit kit campaigns are
generating millions of dollars in revenue. As a result they are
continually evolving to maximize the amount of users that are
impacted. Security researchers are constantly trying to find
common threads or connections between threats or groups of
threats. This research is an excellent example of how leveraging
little crumbs of information and gathering over long periods of time
can provide meaningful results.
At this point Talos can draw strong connections between Angler and Bedep. It stands to
reason that the instances of Angler that are delivering Bedep are actually tied to Angler
itself. This would explain Bedep being leveraged to drive users to other Angler instances. It
would ensure, as an Angler customer, a certain amount of users would be guaranteed to be
driven to the Angler instance. This would also tie back to the instance that was initially
delivering the Flash 0-day was also owned by the same group. The additional connection
on the back-end of Angler activity to the system delivering the payloads is yet another
thread that keeps these two groups closely aligned. It's not possible with the data we have
to say for certain that the two groups are in fact the same. However, there are a lot of
coincidences that we have outlined to make the case that they are at the very least closely
related and leveraging some of the same infrastructure.
Additionally, through this investigation we have found links between these activities and
other threats including several different trojans that can be delivered through multiple
methods including as email attachments. This points to a larger organization that is using
various threats to infect users for monetary gain.
