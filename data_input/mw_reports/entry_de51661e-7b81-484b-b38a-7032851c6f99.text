Cyber Espionage is Alive
and Well: APT32 and the
Threat to Global
Corporations
May 14, 2017 | by Nick Carr
Cyber espionage actors, now designated by FireEye as APT32 (OceanLotus Group), are
carrying out intrusions into private sector companies across multiple industries and have
also targeted foreign governments, dissidents, and journalists. FireEye assesses that
APT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with
commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with
Vietnamese state interests.

APT32 and FireEye’s Community Response
In the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business
interests in Vietnam, FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants uncovered
activity and attacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a significant intrusion
campaign. In March 2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team
launched a Community Protection Event (CPE) – a coordinated effort between Mandiant
incident responders, FireEye as a Service (FaaS), FireEye iSight Intelligence, and FireEye
product engineering – to protect all clients from APT32 activity.

In the following weeks, FireEye released threat intelligence products and updated
malware profiles to customers while developing new detection techniques for APT32’s
tools and phishing lures. This focused intelligence and detection effort led to new
external victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link
twelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor
activity into FireEye’s newest named advanced persistent threat group: APT32.

APT32 Targeting of Private Sector Company Operations in
Southeast Asia
Since at least 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a
vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.
Furthermore, there are indications that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network
security and technology infrastructure corporations.
Here is an overview of intrusions investigated by FireEye that are attributed to APT32:
In 2014, a European corporation was compromised prior to constructing a
manufacturing facility in Vietnam.
In 2016, Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations working in network security,
technology infrastructure, banking, and media industries were targeted.
In mid-2016, malware that FireEye believes to be unique to APT32 was detected on
the networks of a global hospitality industry developer with plans to expand
operations into Vietnam.
From 2016 through 2017, two subsidiaries of U.S. and Philippine consumer products
corporations, located inside Vietnam, were the target of APT32 intrusion operations.
Table 1 shows a breakdown of APT32 activity, including the malware families used in
each.

Table 1: APT32 Private Sector Targeting Identified by FireEye

APT32 Interest in Political Influence and Foreign
Governments
In addition to focused targeting of the private sector with ties to Vietnam, APT32 has
also targeted foreign governments, as well as Vietnamese dissidents and journalists since
at least 2013. Here is an overview of this activity:
PDFmyURL converts any url to pdf!

A public blog published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation indicated that
journalists, activists, dissidents, and bloggers were targeted in 2013 by malware and
tactics consistent with APT32 operations.
In 2014, APT32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled “Plans to crackdown on
protesters at the Embassy of Vietnam.exe," which targeted dissident activity among
the Vietnamese diaspora in Southeast Asia. Also in 2014, APT32 carried out an
intrusion against a Western country’s national legislature.
In 2015, SkyEye Labs, the security research division of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360,
released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting Chinese public and
private entities including government agencies, research institutes, maritime
agencies, sea construction, and shipping enterprises. The information included in the
report indicated that the perpetrators used the same malware, overlapping
infrastructure, and similar targets as APT32.
In 2015 and 2016, two Vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that
FireEye assesses to be unique to APT32.
In 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that
they were likely used to target members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well
as government employees in the Philippines.

APT32 Tactics
In their current campaign, APT32 has leveraged ActiveMime files that employ social
engineering methods to entice the victim into enabling macros. Upon execution, the
initialized file downloads multiple malicious payloads from remote servers. APT32 actors
continue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails.
APT32 actors designed multilingual lure documents which were tailored to specific
victims. Although the files had “.doc” file extensions, the recovered phishing lures were
ActiveMime “.mht” web page archives that contained text and images. These files were
likely created by exporting Word documents into single file web pages.
Table 2 contains a sample of recovered APT32 multilingual lure files.

Table 2: Sampling of APT32 Lure Files

The Base64 encoded ActiveMime data also contained an OLE file with malicious macros.
When opened, many lure files displayed fake error messages in an attempt to trick users
into launching the malicious macros. Figure 1 shows a fake Gmail-theme paired with a
hexadecimal error code that encourages the recipient to enable content to resolve the
error. Figure 2 displays another APT32 lure that used a convincing image of a fake
Windows error message instructing the recipient to enable content to properly display
document font characters.

Figure 2: Example APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Text Encoding Error Message

APT32 operators implemented several novel techniques to track the efficacy of their
phishing, monitor the distribution of their malicious documents, and establish persistence
mechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory.
In order to track who opened the phishing emails, viewed the links, and downloaded the
attachments in real-time, APT32 used cloud-based email analytics software designed for
sales organizations. In some instances, APT32 abandoned direct email attachments
altogether and relied exclusively on this tracking technique with links to their
ActiveMime lures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services.
To enhance visibility into the further distribution of their phishing lures, APT32 utilized
the native web page functionality of their ActiveMime documents to link to external
images hosted on APT32 monitored infrastructure.
Figure 3 contains an example phishing lure with HTML image tags used for additional
tracking by APT32.

the external image, even if macros were disabled. In all phishing lures analyzed, the
external images did not exist. Mandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring
web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images. When combined
with email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success
rate, and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the
interest of security firms.
Once macros were enabled on the target system, the malicious macros created two
named scheduled tasks as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected
system. The first named scheduled task launched an application whitelisting script
protection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first
backdoor from APT32’s infrastructure and injected it into memory. The second named
scheduled task, loaded as an XML file to falsify task attributes, ran a JavaScript code
block that downloaded and launched a secondary backdoor, delivered as a multi-stage
PowerShell script. In most lures, one scheduled task persisted an APT32-specific
backdoor and the other scheduled task initialized a commercially-available backdoor as
backup.
To illustrate the complexity of these lures, Figure 4 shows the creation of persistence
mechanisms for recovered APT32 lure “2017年员工工资性津贴额统计报告.doc”.

Figure 4: APT32 ActiveMime Lures Create Two Named Scheduled Tasks

In this example, a scheduled task named “Windows Scheduled Maintenance” was created
to run Casey Smith’s “Squiblydoo” App Whitelisting bypass every 30 minutes. While all
payloads can be dynamically updated, at the time of delivery, this task launched a COM
scriptlet (“.sct” file extension) that downloaded and executed Meterpreter hosted on
images.chinabytes[.]info. Meterpreter then loaded Cobalt Strike BEACON, configured to
communicate with 80.255.3[.]87 using the Safebrowsing malleable C2 profile to further
blend in with network traffic. A second scheduled task named “Scheduled Defrags” was
created by loading the raw task XML with a backdated task creation timestamp of June
2, 2016. This second task ran “mshta.exe” every 50 minutes which launched an APT32PDFmyURL converts any url to pdf!

Figure 5 illustrates the chain of events for a single successful APT32 phishing lure that
dynamically injects two multi-stage malware frameworks into memory.

Figure 5: APT32 Phishing Chain of Events

The impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim
environments. Several Mandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access,
APT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their
PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon’s InvokeObfuscation framework.
APT32 regularly used stealthy techniques to blend in with legitimate user activity:
During one investigation, APT32 was observed using a privilege escalation exploit
(CVE-2016-7255) masquerading as a Windows hotfix.
In another investigation, APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to
distribute their malware as a software deployment task in which all systems pulled
the payload from the ePO server using the proprietary SPIPE protocol.
APT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their
malware on a system. For example, APT32 installed one backdoor as a persistent
service with a legitimate service name that had a Unicode no-break space character
appended to it. Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL filename
padded with a non-printing OS command control code.

APT32 Malware and Infrastructure

PDFmyURL converts any url to pdf!

APT32 Malware and Infrastructure
APT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite
of backdoors spanning multiple protocols. APT32 operations are characterized through
deployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD, KOMPROGO,
SOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL. APT32 often deploys these backdoors along with the
commercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor. APT32 may also possess
backdoor development capabilities for macOS.
The capabilities for this unique suite of malware is shown in Table 3.

APT32 operators appear to be well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of
domains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure. The FireEye iSIGHT
Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on these backdoor families
based on Mandiant investigations of APT32 intrusions.
Figure 6 provides a summary of APT32 tools and techniques mapped to each stage of
the attack lifecycle.

Outlook and Implications
Based on incident response investigations, product detections, and intelligence
observations along with additional publications on the same operators, FireEye assesses
that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests.
The targeting of private sector interests by APT32 is notable and FireEye believes the
actor poses significant risk to companies doing business in, or preparing to invest in, the
country. While the motivation for each APT32 private sector compromise varied – and in
cases
unknown
– the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law

some cases was unknown – the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law
enforcement, intellectual property theft, or anticorruption measures that could
ultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations. Furthermore,
APT32 continues to threaten political activism and free speech in Southeast Asia and the
public sector worldwide. Governments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam
diaspora may continue to be targeted.
While actors from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea remain the most active cyber
espionage threats tracked and responded to by FireEye, APT32 reflects a growing host
of new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability. APT32 demonstrates how
accessible and impactful offensive capabilities can be with the proper investment and
the flexibility to embrace newly-available tools and techniques. As more countries utilize
inexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these
threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond
public sector and intelligence targets.
