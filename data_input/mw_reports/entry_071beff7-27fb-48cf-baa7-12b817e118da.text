Symantec Security Response is aware of recent reports of Madi, a Trojan used in targeted
campaigns and observed in the wild since December 2011.
The following is an email example, discovered in the Madi campaign, which included a
malicious PowerPoint attachment:

In one example, opening the PowerPoint attachment displays a series of video stills
showing a missile destroying a jet plane. During the final PowerPoint slide, a dialog
window is displayed to the user requesting permission to run an executable file:

Symantec detects this malicious executable as Trojan.Madi using the latest LiveUpdate
definitions. It is capable of stealing information—including keylogging functionality. The
Trojan can also update itself. We have observed Trojan.Madi communicating with
command-and-control servers hosted in Iran and, more recently, Azerbaijan.
Targets of the Madi campaign appear to be all over the spectrum but include oil
companies, US-based think tanks, a foreign consulate, as well as various governmental
agencies, including some in the energy sector.

Although Madi has been seen targeting various Middle Eastern countries, it has also been
found across the globe from the United States to New Zealand.

Where high profile attacks such as Flamer, Duqu, and Stuxnet utilize different techniques
to exploit systems—including leveraging zero-day attacks—the Madi attack relies on social
engineering techniques to get onto targeted computers.
Targets like Iran, Israel, and Saudi Arabia might suggest involvement of a nation state,
however our research has not found evidence that this is the case. Instead, the current
research indicates these attacks are being conducted by an unknown Farsi-speaking
hacker with a broad agenda.
