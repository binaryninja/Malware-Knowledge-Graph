Summary
Purple Fox rootkit is an active malware campaign that has been distributed using a fake malicious
Telegram installer since early 2022. Purple Fox attempts to stay under the radar by breaking its
attack chain down into multiple discrete stages. Each stage of the attack is carried out by a different
file, with each file being useless without the entire file set. While using legitimate installers is already
a popular technique, using such a popular application is certainly notable, as is breaking up the
malware's functionality to make analysis more difficult.
The malware’s main goal is to gain a foothold on targeted Windows® machines by loading a rootkit
that is planted beyond the reach of antivirus (AV) products, helping the malware remain hidden. This
rootkit provides the attacker with a backdoor into the victim’s machine, from which further malicious
activity can be carried out.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
The attack chain for Purple Fox begins when the victim is lured into launching a Trojanized installer
for the popular instant messaging application Telegram, a freeware, cross-platform, cloud-based
service. The installer is an AutoIt-compiled script, which appears on desktops with the icon shown in
Figure 1.

Figure 1 - Fake malicious installer “Telegram Desktop.exe”
When launched, this fake Telegram installer will create a directory called “TextInputh” within the
“AppData/Temp” folder. The installer drops two files into this directory. One of the files is a legitimate
copy of Telegram.exe, which is not launched or used in the attack chain, but it is created to help the
malicious installer appear legitimate to the target. The other file is an executable called
“TextInputh.exe,” as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 - Files dropped to Temp directory by fake installer
TextInputh.exe is the main malicious downloader. When executed, it will reach out to its commandand-control (C2) server, which at the time of writing was hosted at 193[.]164[.]223[.]77 (as shown
below), to retrieve the next-stage payloads.

Figure 3 - Main downloader creating a connection with the C2
The downloader creates a folder within the “Users/Public/Videos” directory, which is named using a
combination of random numbers. In the analysis carried out for this report, the folder was named
“1642069858.” The files retrieved from the C2 server are stored in this folder.
The first file downloaded is an archive file called “1.rar.” The second file is a copy of 7Zip called
“7zz.exe,” which is used to extract the RAR archive. The unzipped archive contains four files, as
seen in Figure 4. Once these four files have been extracted, the initial archive and the 7Zip
application are both automatically deleted from the machine.

TextInputh.exe also creates a copy of “360.tct,” “rundll3222.exe” and “svchost.txt” within the
“/ProgramData” folder. The file “ojbk.exe” is used to load the file “360.tct”, as seen in Figure 5. This
is a DLL file that is used to read and execute the payload contained within svchost.txt.

Figure 5 - File “ojbk.exe” is used to load the DLL “360.tct”
When svchost.txt is executed, it drops five additional files into the “/ProgramData" folder. These files
are named “Calldriver.exe,” “Driver.sys,” “dll.dll,” “kill360.bat,” and “speedmem2.hg.”
The DLL file “dll.dll” performs a User Account Control (UAC) bypass by modifying the value of three
registry keys to zero. Many malware authors use this technique to elevate process privileges on a
system. The registry keys in question are as follows:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\PromptOnSecureDesktop
The five dropped files work together, with the goal of disabling and blocking antivirus programs, in
particular the security solution “360 AV,” a free antivirus and system optimization utility. This evasion
technique is done prior to the deployment of the final Purple Fox payload, to allow the rootkit to be
planted and launched without being detected.
The file “kill360.bat” is a script that is used to prevent 360 AV processes from running. Within this
script, the names of the four other files that help achieve this can be seen.
This BAT script is used to place a copy of the SQL file “speedmem2.hg” into the 360 AV directory.
Once the files have been executed, the script deletes them from the “/ProgramData” directory in a
bid to clean up after itself and remain undetected on the target machine.

Figure 6 - Functionality of ”kill360.bat”
The Purple Fox malware continues the attack chain by performing a check on the infected machine
for the presence of a pre-set list of antivirus products. This list includes vendors such as TrendMicro,
Kaspersky and McAfee.
The malware will also perform a scan of the victim’s machine to gather a range of information,
including the hostname, CPU type, driver type and memory status. This information is then
exfiltrated to the C2 server, which in this instance is hosted at 144[.]48[.]243[.]79.
At the time of our investigation, this C2 server was no longer online, and as a result, the last stage of
the attack that retrieves the rootkit could not be replicated directly. However, for analysis purposes, a
copy of the payload from the above C2 address that contains the rootkit has been retrieved from
VirusTotal.

Figure 7 - MSI file which contains kernel payload
The payload is an MSI file which contains encrypted shellcode. When launched, it displays an
installation screen and prompts the victim to give a “yes” or “no” response, as shown in Figure 7.
Once the victim has approved the prompt, the system performs a restart. This allows for registry key
changes, including the UAC bypass, to take effect and it allows the rootkit to be deployed at the
kernel level without disruption.

Conclusion
Malware bundling itself with legitimate installers to gain access to a victim’s machine is not new to
world of cybersecurity. Indeed, the threat our team covered last week, Jupyter infostealer, also uses
this highly effective technique. However, the manner in which Purple Fox goes about this malicious
activity brings a new level of creativity to the way these intrusions are performed.
The multistage attack chain used by the latest version of Purple Fox is a devious addition, which will
aid the attacker in remaining undetected by security solutions. This innovative approach to evasion
and disguise makes it easier for Purple Fox to deliver and deploy its final rootkit payload to the
target machine. From here, the possibilities for further malicious activity are practically endless.
