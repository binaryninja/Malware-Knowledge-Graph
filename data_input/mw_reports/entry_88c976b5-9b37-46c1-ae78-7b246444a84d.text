5 March 2021 / QNAP

Background
On March 2, 2021, 360Netlab Threat Detection System started to report attacks targeting the
widely used QNAP NAS devices via the unauthorized remote command execution
vulnerability (CVE-2020-2506 & CVE-2020-2507)[1], upon successful attack, the attacker will
gain root privilege on the device and perform malicious mining activities.
Due to the possible big impact, we contacted and informed the vendor on March 3, and
decided to share some information with this quick blog.
Note 1, there is currently no public available PoC for CVE-2020-2506 & CVE-2020-2507,
also according to the vendor’s request, we are not disclosing the technical details of the
vulnerability in order to protect QNAP NAS users, we speculate that there are still hundreds
of thousands of online QNAP NAS devices with the vulnerability.
We named the mining program UnityMiner, we noticed the attacker customized the program
by hiding the mining process and the real CPU memory resource usage information, so
when the QNAP users check the system usage via the WEB management interface, they
cannot see the abnormal system behavior.
Previously We have disclosed another QNAP NAS in-the-wild vulnerability attack here[2].

Vulnerability impact
Our 360 FirmwareTotal system shows that the following models are affected by the
vulnerabilities. The QNAP NAS installed Helpdesk app prior to August 2020 is affected. The
following is the list of known models that could be vulnerable.

Brief analysis of the mining kit
1. Overview
The mining program consists of unity_install.sh and Quick.tar.gz .
unity_install.sh is used to download & set up & start the mining program and hijack the
manaRequest.cgi program in the original device;
Quick.tar.gz contains the miner program, the miner configuration file, the miner startup

script and the forged manaRequest.cgi .
Unity is the XMRig miner program
Quick
├── config.json
├── manaRequest.cgi
├── start.sh
└── unity

2. unity_install.sh
Core functions：
Check if unity process exists, kill if it exists
Check the CPU architecture of the device and download the mining kit for the
corresponding architecture, currently it only supports ARM64 and AMD64
Set the mining parameters in config.json based on the number of CPU cores, the
program makes sure it only uses half of the cores for mining.
Unpack the mining program, set cron and execute the mining script start.sh (once
every minute, time interval is set directly to * * * * * * )
3. start.sh
Core function：

Checking for unity process and starting it if it does not exist.
Rename the system file /home/httpd/cgi-bin/management/manaRequest.cgi to
manaRequests.cgi (this file is responsible for viewing and modifying the system
information of the device)
Copy the manaRequest.cgi file from Quick.tar.gz to the /home/httpd/cgibin/management/ directory, replacing the system's own file with the same name.
4. config.json
The group uses its own Pool(Proxy), so the real XMR Wallet cannot be seen. There are 3
groups of mining configurations, user are "xmr2", pass are "x", Pool(Proxy) are as follows.
aquamangts.tk:12933
a.aquamangts.tk:12933
b.aquamangts.tk:12933

5. manaRequest.cgi
Core function：
Hijack the system's original file of the same name, after receiving HTTP requests, first
detect whether there is a unity mining process in the system, if not, then directly
transfer the HTTP request to the system's original file of the same name (has been
renamed to manaRequests.cgi ) to process, and then end the execution of.
count=`ps -fe | grep unity | grep -v "grep"`
if [ "" == "$count" ];then
/home/httpd/cgi-bin/management/manaRequests.cgi
exit 0
fi

If the unity mining process exists on the system, after forwarding the HTTP request to
the system's original file of the same name for execution, log the results of the
execution (to the .log.log file) and then tamper with the execution results by
1. Subtract 50 from the CPU status data
2. Delete the unity process information from the execution result
So when the user suspects something going on with the device and checks the usage, he
will see pretty normal CPU usage and tempc, and all the system processes will look normal.

Suggestions
QNAP NAS users should check and update their firmware promptly.
