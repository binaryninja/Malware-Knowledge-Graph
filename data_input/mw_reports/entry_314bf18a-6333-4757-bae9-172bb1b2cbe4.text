EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 2018, the Cybereason Nocturnus team identiﬁed an advanced, persistent attack targeting
global telecommunications providers carried out by a threat actor using tools and techniques
commonly associated with Chinese-afﬁliated threat actors, such as APT10. This multi-wave
attacks focused on obtaining data of speciﬁc, high-value targets and resulted in a complete
takeover of the network.

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

Key Points
Earlier this year, Cybereason identiﬁed an advanced, persistent attack targeting
telecommunications providers that has been underway for years, soon after deploying into
the environment.
Cybereason spotted the attack and later supported the telecommunications provider
through four more waves of the advanced persistent attack over the course of 6 months.
Based on the data available to us, Operation Soft Cell has been active since at least 2012,
though some evidence suggests even earlier activity by the threat actor against
telecommunications providers.
The attack was aiming to obtain CDR records of a large telecommunications provider.
The threat actor was attempting to steal all data stored in the active directory,
compromising every single username and password in the organization, along with other
personally identiﬁable information, billing data, call detail records, credentials, email
servers, geo-location of users, and more.
The tools and TTPs used are commonly associated with Chinese threat actors
During the persistent attack, the attackers worked in waves- abandoning one thread of
attack when it was detected and stopped, only to return months later with new tools and
techniques.

Security Recommendations
Add an additional security layer for web servers. For example, use WAF (Web Application
FW) to prevent trivial attacks on Internet-facing web servers.
Expose as few systems or ports to the Internet as possible. Make sure that all web servers
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
and web services that are exposed are patched.

INTRODUCTION
Watch our CEO Lior Div's keynote on the operation.
In 2018, 30% of the telecommunications providers reported sensitive customer information was
stolen due to an attack. These telecommunications providers have been expanding in size, to the
point where In the past thirteen years, mobile cellular phone subscribers have quadrupled in size
and sit at 8 billion subscribers today. Due to their wide availability and the fundamental service
they bring, telecommunications providers have become critical infrastructure for the majority of
world powers.
Ask the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar.
Sign up for the Operation Soft Cell webinar.
Much like telecommunication providers, many other critical infrastructure organizations provide a
valuable targets for nation state threat actors, due to their high impact. In studies, nearly a quarter
of critical infrastructure organizations reported they had been hit by nation state attacks and 60%
said disruptive cyber attacks are among the threats they are most worried about.
Threat actors, especially those at the level of nation state, are seeking opportunities to attack
these organizations, conducting elaborate, advanced operations to gain leverage, seize strategic
assets, and collect information. When successful, these attacks often have huge implications.
Last year, we identiﬁed a threat actor that has been operating in telecommunications provider
environments for at least two years. We performed a post-incident review of the attacks and were
able to identify changes in the attack patterns along with new activity every quarter.
The threat actor mainly sought to obtain CDR data (call logs, cell tower locations, etc.) belonging
to speciﬁc individuals from various countries. This type of targeted cyber espionage is usually the
work of nation state threat actors.
We’ve concluded with a high level of certainty that the threat actor is afﬁliated with China and is
likely state sponsored. The tools and techniques used throughout these attacks are consistent
with several Chinese threat actors, such as APT10, a threat actor believed to operate on behalf of
the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

The threat actor changed activity every quarter.
The attack began with a web shell running on a vulnerable, publicly-facing server, from which the
attackers gathered information about the network and propagated across the network. The threat
actor attempted to compromise critical assets, such as database servers, billing servers, and the
active directory. As malicious activity was detected and remediated against, the threat actor
stopped the attack.
The second wave of the attack hit several months later with similar inﬁltration attempts, along with
a modiﬁed version of the web shell and reconnaissance activities. A game of cat and mouse
between the threat actor and the defenders began, as they ceased and resumed their attack 2
more times in the span of a 4 month period.

Anatomy of the Attack
Initial Compromise: the Modiﬁed China Chopper Web Shell
The initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an IIS server,
coming out of the w3wp.exe process. An investigation of the web shell, later classiﬁed as a
modiﬁed version of the China Chopper web shell, uncovered several attack phases and TTPs.
The threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands, steal
credentials, and deploy other tools.

Malicious web shell activity as observed in the Cybereason solution.

Commands executed via a modiﬁed version of the China Chopper web shell.
China Chopper is a web shell ﬁrst discovered in 2012 that is commonly used by malicious
Chinese actors. It is used to remotely control web servers, and has been used in many attacks
against Australian web hosting providers. The web shell parameters in this attack match to the
China Chopper parameters, as described in FireEye’s analysis of China Chopper. This tool has
been used by several Chinese-afﬁliated threat actors, such as APT 27 and APT 40. It is important
to note that this tool is widely available and can be used by other threat actors.

Reconnaissance and Credential Stealing
The threat actor launched a series of reconnaissance commands to try to obtain and enumerate
information about the compromised machine, network architecture, users, and active directory
enumeration.

Example 1: Reconnaissance Commands

Example 2: Reconnaissance Commands

Modiﬁed “nbtscan”
One of the reconnaissance commands was to run a modiﬁed nbtscan tool ("NetBIOS nameserver
scanner") to identify available NetBIOS name servers locally or over the network. Nbtscan has
been used by APT10 in Operation Cloud Hopper to search for services of interest across the IT
estate and footprint endpoints of interest. It is also capable of identifying system information.

NetBIOS Scanner execution as seen in the Cybereason solution.

NetBIOS scanner is set to scan an internal IP range.

Modiﬁed Mimikatz
Following the reconnaissance phase, the threat actor attempted to dump credentials stored on
the compromised machines. The most common credential stealing tool used by the threat actor
was a modiﬁed mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes. This version of mimikatz did not require any
command line arguments, most likely in an attempt to avoid detection based on command-line
auditing. The dumped hashes were used to authenticate to other machines via pass the hash. We
renamed this sample to maybemimi.exe.

maybemimi strings.

Dumping the SAM Hive from the Registry
In order to obtain credentials, the threat actor used another technique that can be seen in the
below screenshots. They dumped speciﬁc hives from the Windows Registry, such as the SAM
hive, which contains password hashes.
Reg.exe is being spawned from a shell process.

Command-line arguments indicate SAM hive dumping.

Lateral Movement
Once the threat actor mapped the network and obtained credentials (through net use), they
began to move laterally. They were able to compromise critical assets including production
servers and database servers, and they even managed to gain full control of the Domain
Controller. The threat actor relied on WMI and PsExec to move laterally and install their tools
across multiple assets.
The following example demonstrates how the threat actor moved laterally from the ﬁrst machine,
compromised by the modiﬁed version of the China Chopper web shell, to other machines inside
the network.
/c cd /d "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\ecp\auth\"&wmic
/node:[REDACTED] /user:"[REDACTED]" /password:"[REDACTED]" process call create
a.bat&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]
WMI command used by the threat actor to move laterally.

Maintaining a Long-term Foothold and Stealing Data
The threat actor abused the stolen credentials to create rogue, high-privileged domain user
accounts which they then used to take malicious action. By creating these accounts, they ensured
they would maintain access between different waves of the attack. Once the threat actor regains
their foothold, they already have access to a high-privileged domain user account. This
signiﬁcantly reduces the “noise” of having to use credential dumpers repeatedly, which helped
them evade detection.

PoisonIvy
A second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets was
through the deployment of the PoisonIvy RAT (PIVY). This infamous RAT has been associated
with many different Chinese threat actors, including APT10, APT1, and DragonOK. It is a
powerful, multi-featured RAT that lets a threat actor take total control over a machine. Among its
most notable features are:
Registry Editor
Screenshot Grabber
Credential Stealer
Interactive Shell
File Manager with Upload and Download Support
Process Monitor
Keylogging and Various other Surveillance Features

The control panel for PoisonIvy.
Courtesy of Sam Bowne - samsclass.info
We assume the threat actor used PoisonIvy for keylogging and other surveillance features, as
they had that functionality available to them as shown in the screenshot above.
The strain of PIVY in this attack used a DLL side-loading technique to stealthily load itself into
memory. To accomplish this, it exploited a trusted and signed application. The PIVY payload was
dropped along with the trusted and signed Samsung tool (RunHelp.exe) in the following manner:
1. A nullsoft installer package (NSIS) was created with a legitimate, signed Samsung tool in it.
2. Once executed, the installer script within the NSIS package extracted the Samsung tool
and added a fake DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), which is
required by the application.
3. The DLL contains a PIVY stager, which is then loaded by the Samsung tool.
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
4. After the fake DLL was loaded by the Samsung tool, it decrypted a blob payload in the

5. It was able to achieve persistence by creating a rogue scheduled task.

Post-persistence execution of PIVY, side-loaded into a legitimate Samsung application.
PIVY’s use of DLL side-loading to abuse Samsung tools is not new, and has been reported
previously by Palo Alto. In 2016 it was used to attack pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong, most
probably by Chinese threat actors.

⚠ Note: Our team has reached out to and advised the targeted organizations on active
containment actions.

Secondary Web Shells
In later stages of the attack, the threat actor deployed two other custom-built web shells. From
these web shells, they launched reconnaissance commands, stole data, and dropped additional
tools including portqry.exe, renamed cmd.exe, winrar, and the notorious hTran.

Reconnaissance and lateral movement commands launched from the secondary web shell.

Data Exﬁltration
The threat actor exﬁltrated stolen data using multiple different channels including web shells and
hTran.

Compressing the Stolen Data
In an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data, the threat actor used winrar to compress and
password-protect it. The winrar binaries and compressed data were found mostly in the Recycle
Bin folder, a TTP that was previously observed in APT10-related attacks, as well as others. This
threat actor is known to stage the data in multi-part archives before exﬁltration.
The threat actor used the following commands to compress the data.
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers

rar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -[password] [REDACTED].rar [REDACTED].temp

rar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -[password] [REDACTED].rar [REDACTED].csv
rar a -r -[password] [REDACTED].rar sam system ntds.dit

Compressed stolen data exﬁltrated via web shell.
The contents of the compressed data was crucial in understanding the threat actor’s motivation
for the attack, as well as what type of information they were after.

hTran
In order to exﬁltrate data from a network segment not connected to the Internet, the threat actor
deployed a modiﬁed version of hTran. This ‘connection bouncer’ tool lets the threat actor redirect
ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate C2 server trafﬁc. There have
been numerous reports of hTran being used by different Chinese threat actors, including: APT3,
APT27 and DragonOK.
The threat actor made some modiﬁcations to the original source code of hTran. Many strings,
including the debug messages, were intentionally changed and obfuscated in an attempt to evade
detection and thwart efforts to identify the malware by antivirus and researchers.

Obfuscated debug messages.
Since the original source code for hTran is publicly available, we were able to compare the debug
output to the original source code to show that it has indeed been modiﬁed.

Understanding the Motive
When you think of large breaches to big organizations, the ﬁrst thing that comes to mind is usually
payment data. An organization that provides services to a large customer base has a lot of credit
card data, bank account information, and more personal data on its systems. These attacks are
usually conducted by a cybercrime group looking to make money.
In contrast, when a nation state threat actor is attacking a big organization, the end goal is
typically not ﬁnancial, but rather intellectual property or sensitive information about their clients.
One of the most valuable pieces of data that telecommunications providers hold is Call Detail
Records (CDRs). CDRs are a large subset of metadata that contains all details about calls,
including:
Source, Destination, and Duration of a Call
Device Details
Physical Location
Device Vendor and Version
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
For a nation state threat actor, obtaining access to this data gives them intimate knowledge of any

individuals they wish to target on that network. It lets them answer questions like:

12/21

9/11/2019

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

Who are the individuals talking to?
Which devices are the individuals using?
Where are the individuals traveling?
Having this information becomes particularly valuable when nation-state threat actors are
targeting foreign intelligence agents, politicians, opposition candidates in an election, or even law
enforcement.

Example 1: CDR Data

https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers

13/21

9/11/2019

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

Example 3: CDR Data
Beyond targeting individual users, this attack is also alarming because of the threat posed by the
control of a telecommunications provider. Telecommunications has become critical infrastructure
for the majority of world powers. A threat actor with total access to a telecommunications provider,
as is the case here, can attack however they want passively and also actively work to sabotage
the network.
This attack has widespread implications, not just for individuals, but also for organizations and
countries alike. The use of speciﬁc tools and the choice to hide ongoing operations for years
points to a nation state threat actor, most likely China. This is another form of cyber warfare being
used to establish a foothold and gather information undercover until they are ready to strike.

Threat Intel Research
The following sections detail the methodology and work process used to piece together the
various stages and components of the attack. This work enabled us to not only reconstruct these
attacks, but also to ﬁnd additional artifacts and information regarding the threat actor and its
operations.

Methodology
Step 1: Creating and Maintaining an IOC Inventory
The ﬁrst step in this process was to create a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise
(IOCs) observed throughout the different stages of the attack. This list included various indicators,
such as ﬁle hashes, domains, IP addresses, ﬁle names, and registry/service names. In addition to
this, our reverse engineers were able to extract further IOCs from the collected samples, which
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
have also been added to the list.

14/21

9/11/2019

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

The list of IOCs was periodically updated and fed back into our threat intel engine as more were
discovered.

Step 2: Hunting for Known Evil
Equipped with an ever-growing list of known IOCs, our team set out to hunt for “low-hanging fruit”
across multiple environments. This step was done by using both internal sources, such as the
Cybereason solution, as well as hunting for indicators in the wild.
The hunt for “known evil” yielded interesting results that helped uncover additional compromised
assets as well as more parts of the attack infrastructure.

Step 3: Threat Actor’s Arsenal
Perhaps one of the most interesting steps involved identifying and analyzing the tools the threat
actor used throughout the attack. The combination of the preference of tools, sequence of use,
and speciﬁcally how they are used during the attack says a lot about a threat actor, especially
when it comes to attribution.
One of the more notable aspects was how the threat actor used mostly known tools that were
customized for this speciﬁc attack. Each tool was customized differently, and included re-writing
the code, stripping debug symbols, string obfuscation, and embedding the victim’s speciﬁc
information within the tools’ conﬁguration.
However, the threat actor also used tools we were not able to attribute to any known tool. These
tools were used in the later stages of the attack, once the operation was already discovered. This
was most likely to decrease the risk of exposure or attribution.
Finally, the payloads were almost never repeated. The threat actor made sure that each payload
had a unique hash, and some payloads were packed using different types of packers, both known
and custom.
The main tools these attacks had in common are:
1. Web Shells
A modiﬁed version of the China Chopper web shell was used for initial compromise.
Custom-built web shells were used for later phases of the attack.
2. Reconnaissance Tools
A modiﬁed version of Nbtscan was used to identify available NetBIOS name servers
locally or over the network.
Multiple Windows built-in tools were used for various tasks, including whoami,
net.exe, ipconﬁg, netstat, portqry, and more.
WMI and PowerShell commands were used for various tasks.
3. RAT
PoisonIvy was used to maintain access across the compromised assets.
PlugX was used in some of the instances that we're aware of.
4. Credential Dumpers
A modiﬁed version of Mimikatz was used to dump credentials stored on the
compromised machines.
A PowerShell-based Mimikatz was also used to dump credentials stored on the
compromised machines.
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
5. Lateral movement

15/21

9/11/2019

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

PsExec was also used for lateral movement.
6. Connection Proxy
A modiﬁed version of hTran was used to exﬁltrate stolen data.
7. Compression tool
Winrar was used to compress and password-protect stolen data.

Step 4: Creating a TTP-based Behavioral Proﬁle
One of the key components of threat hunting is to create a TTP-based behavioral proﬁle of the
threat actor in question. Malware payloads and operational infrastructure can be quickly changed
or replaced over time, and as such, the task of tracking a threat actor can become quite difﬁcult.
For that reason, it is crucial to proﬁle the threat actor and study its behavior, the tools it uses, and
its techniques. These behavioral-based TTPs are less likely to change drastically, and are\ key
factors of any threat hunt or attribution efforts.
The Cybereason solution is compatible with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which made it easy
to keep track of the observed TTPs and correlate the data with known threat actors.
The following chart reﬂects the behavioral proﬁle of the threat actor based on the most frequently
observed techniques used throughout these attacks.

In order to make sense of all the data, we fed it into multiple threat intelligence sources, including
our own and third parties.

⚠ Note: Since we cannot share any IOCs, we will refer to ﬁle hashes, hostnames, IP
addresses and other IOCs as generic placeholders.

Hostname1 is the hostname that was used for the C2 server targeting the telecommunications
providers.

Hostname1 connected to multiple tools.
In analyzing the ﬁles, it is clear they are all contacting the same host hostname1. hostname1 was
the C2 server that the malware and web shells connected to.
Once we determined the hashes in the scope of the attack were only connecting to hostname1,
which is a dynamic DNS hostname, we looked to see if we could ﬁnd more information about the
C2 server.
A simple WHOIS query revealed that the IP address was registered to a colocation hosting
company in Asia, though there was no other publicly available information about this IP address.
By querying all of our threat intel resources about this IP address, we discovered that it was
associated with multiple dynamic DNS hostnames.

https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

Multiple dynamic DNS hostnames.
We were unable to ﬁnd indications of connections to Dynamic.DNS2 and Dynamic.DNS3.
However, they were registered and associated with IP.Address1.
For the other dynamic DNS hosts, we leveraged various threat intel repositories and crafted
queries that searched for executables with these IP addresses and hostnames in their string
table. One of the queries returned a few DLLs with identical names to the DLL we had initially
investigated. However, the hashes were different. After obtaining the found DLLs, we patched
them back into the NSIS installer and detonated the samples in our testing environment. Dynamic
analysis of the newly obtained DLLs revealed a new set of domains and IP addresses that were
completely different. These domains were actually related to different telecommunications
providers.

⚠ Note: Cybereason immediately reached out to those telecommunications providers and
provided them all of the necessary information to handle the incident internally.

Strings from the dumped memory section of the injected shellcode. We can see many details
about the attack including domains and C2 server IP addresses.

The threat actor’s infrastructure.
The threat actor had a speciﬁc pattern of behavior that allowed us to understand their modus
operandi: they used one server with the same IP address for multiple operations. This server is a
key component in their ‘non-attributable’ infrastructure.
The threat actor separated operations by using different hostnames per operation, though they
are hosted on the same server and IP address. The domains and server registration information
https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
pointed to three main countries: China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

19/21

9/11/2019

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

This is cheap and efﬁcient for the threat actor, but is almost transparent for a seasoned
researcher with access to the right threat intelligence tools. There are previous reports of threat
actors including APT10 and APT1 using dynamic DNS.
Monitoring this infrastructure gave us information about if and when the threat actor was starting
new waves of the attack or additional attacks on other providers.
When researching C2 servers, it is important to watch for:
Association with domains, especially if they are dynamic DNS domains.
File hashes that are associated with the IP address or the domain of the C2 server.
Static information and metadata from associated samples that could be used to
broaden the search after additional information is gathered.
This demonstrates the importance of proper operational security and a separation between tools
and operations for threat actors.

Step 6: Rounding Up Immediate/Potential Suspects
Attribution is a ﬁckle and delicate art. In most cases, it is very difﬁcult to achieve 100% certainty
when attributing an attack to a speciﬁc threat actor. It can be tempting to attribute an attack to a
certain threat actor whenever certain tools-of-the-trade, IP addresses, strings, or “indicative”
techniques are observed.
However, it is important to bear in mind that the aforementioned data points are often prone to
manipulation and reuse across different threat actors. Further, they are not impervious to
psychological warfare, as in, trying to “pin” an operation on a different threat actor to avoid proper
attribution.
In order to increase the certainty level when attributing to a speciﬁc threat actor, we took the
following aspects of the attacks into consideration:
Indicators of Compromise
TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures)
Threat actor's tools
Motive behind the attacks
Regional and industry considerations
Carefully examining each of the different aspects plays an important role in avoiding
misattribution. This model offers a more balanced interpretation of the data that is based on a
myriad of components. By performing a contextualized review of the data, you are able to yield a
more wholesome result with greater certainty.
When it comes to attributing Operation Soft Cell, we are unable to achieve 100% certainty with
regard to the identity of the threat actor. However, based on our interpretation of the data, we
conclude with a high level of certainty that:
The threat actor behind Operation Soft Cell is likely state-sponsored.
The threat actor is afﬁliated with China.
After following the above attribution model and carefully reviewing the data, we are able to narrow
down the suspect list to three known APT groups, all of which are known to be linked to Chinahttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers
APT10, APT27, and DragonOK.

20/21

9/11/2019

Operation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers

Having found multiple similarities to previous attacks, it is our estimation that the threat actor
behind these attacks is likely linked to APT10, or at the very least, to a threat actor that shares
tools, techniques, motive and infrastructural preferences with those of APT10.
While we cannot completely rule out a “copy-cat” scenario, where another threat actor might
masquerade as APT10 to thwart attribution efforts, we ﬁnd this option to be less likely in light of
our analysis of the data.

Conclusion
In this blog, we have described an ongoing global attack against telecommunications providers
that has been active since at least 2017. The threat actor managed to inﬁltrate into the deepest
segments of the providers’ network, including some isolated from the internet, as well as
compromise critical assets. Our investigation showed that these attacks were targeted, and that
the threat actor sought to steal communications data of speciﬁc individuals in various countries.
Throughout this investigation, we have uncovered the infrastructure that facilitated the malicious
operations taken by this threat actor. The data exﬁltrated by this threat actor, in conjunction with
the TTPs and tools used, allowed us to determine with a very high probability that the threat
actor behind these malicious operations is backed by a nation state, and is afﬁliated with China.
Our contextualized interpretation of the data suggests that the threat actor is likely APT10, or at
the very least, a threat actor that shares, or wishes to emulate its methods by using the same
tools, techniques, and motives.
It’s important to keep in mind that even though the attacks targeted speciﬁc individuals, any entity
that possesses the power to take over the networks of telecommunications providers can
