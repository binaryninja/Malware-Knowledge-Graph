Today has been busy with ransomware and we have some some good news coming later
today. For this story, though, we are going to take a look at the Azer variant of the Cryptomix
ransomware. This version of Cryptomix was discovered today by security researcher
MalwareHunterTeam right as a decryptor for the previous version, Mole02, was released.
While this ransomware encrypts files in a similar manner to all others in this family, I did
notice some changes in this version that will be outlined below.
As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and decide to
pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it. You can also
discuss or receive support for Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated
Cryptomix Help & Support Topic.

Changes in the Azer Cryptomix Ransomware Variant
While overall the encryption methods stay the same in this variant, there have been some
differences. First and foremost, we have a new ransom note with a file name
of _INTERESTING_INFORMACION_FOR_DECRYPT.TXT. This ransom note contains
instructions to contact either webmafia@asia.com or donald@trampo.info for payment
information.

The next noticeable change is the extension appended to encrypted files. With this version,
when a file is encrypted by the ransomware, it will modify the filename and then append the
string -email-[email_address].AZER to the encrypted file. For example, an test file
encrypted by this variant has an encrypted file name
of 32A1CD301F2322B032AA8C8625EC0768-email-[webmafia@asia.com].AZER.

Folder of Encrypted Azer Files
Last, but not least, this version performs no network communication and is completely offline.
It also embeds ten different RSA-1024 public encryption keys, which are listed below. One of
these keys will be selected to encrypt the AES key used to encrypt a victim's files. This is
quite different compared to the Mole02 variant, which only included one public RSA-1024
key.
As this is just a cursory analysis of this new variant, if anything else is discovered, we will be
sure to update this article.
