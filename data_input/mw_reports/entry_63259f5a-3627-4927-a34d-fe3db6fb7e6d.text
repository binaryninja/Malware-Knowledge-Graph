Meet Ovidiy Stealer: Bringing credential theft to the masses

2/14

July 13, 2017 Proofpoint Staff
Overview
Proofpoint threat researchers recently analyzed Ovidiy Stealer, a previously undocumented credential
stealer which appears to be marketed primarily in the Russian-speaking regions. It is under constant
development, with several updated versions appearing since the original samples were observed in
June 2017. The growing number of samples demonstrate that criminals are actively adopting this
malware. Ovidiy Stealer is priced at 450-750 Rubles (~$7-13 USD) for one build, a price that includes a
precompiled executable that is also "crypted" to thwart analysis and detection.
It should be noted that some antivirus solutions are detecting Ovidiy Stealer with generic and heuristic
signatures only. With only heuristic detection, it is possible that an AV solution will detect the behavior of
Ovidiy Stealer but label it in logs with a generic description and thus SOC analysts monitoring alerts
may well see the event but not recognize its significance. Instead, Ovidiy Stealer could be active an
organization's network, throwing alerts but not identified specifically.
Distribution
We believe that Ovidiy Stealer is currently being spread via email as executable attachments,
compressed executable attachments, and links to an executable download. It is also likely spread via
file hosting / cracking / keygen sites, where it poses as other software or tools. In several cases, we
observed the Ovidiy Stealer bundled with a “LiteBitcoin” installer, further validating this claim.

Figure 1: This file, spread as “litebitcoin-qt.zip,” bundles Ovidiy Stealer and another RAT, Remote
Manipulator System by TektonIT. While the software is installing both malware samples begin to reach
out to the Command and Control (C&C) servers ovidiystealer[.]ru and rmansys[.]ru.
[Update 7/14/2017: The content of this site has been removed since this article was published. The site
itself appears to still be online.]

Analysis
5/14

At the time of writing, we have observed versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.5 distributed in the wild. Ovidiy
Stealer is written in .NET and most samples are packed with with either .NET Reactor or Confuser.
Upon execution the malware will remain in the directory in which it was installed, and where it will carry
out tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no persistence mechanism built into this malware, so on
reboot it will cease to run, but the file will remain on the victim machine.
Ovidiy Stealer is modular and contains functionality to target a multiple applications -- primarily
browsers -- listed below.
FileZilla
Google Chrome
Kometa browser
Amigo browser
Torch browser
Orbitum browser
Opera browser
Because a separate module carries out the targeting of each application, the fewer the modules
selected, the smaller the malware payload size. Buyers can select as few as a single module, for
example just “Google Chrome”.

Figure 4: Example displaying the code for locating and stealing stored FileZilla passwords
Ovidiy Stealer utilizes SSL/TLS for communication with its command and control server. It currently
utilizes the domain ovidiystealer[.]ru for its command and control (C&C) communications; which is is
also the domain used to market and sell the malware. The initial C&C beacon is a POST reporting the
following details:
id: DiskID and ProcessorID
ver: Ovidiy Stealer version
cn: Windows username
os: Operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7)
user: Registered Ovidiy Stealer username

Figure 5: Network traffic capture of initial checkin beacon generated by the stealer
The unique ID provided for each infected machine is a combination of the 8 character DiskID and 16
character ProcessorID, combined into one string. We observed a commonly hardcoded ProcessorID of
“BFEBFBFF000206A7” being used if the function checking the ProcessorID resulted in an empty buffer,
and at least one sample containing “Rofl” for that value. Ovidiy Stealer traffic also includes a hardcoded
User-Agent “E9BC3BD76216AFA560BFB5ACAF5731A3”. This is the md5 hash of the phrase 'litehttp',
which is also the default User-Agent of the open-source LiteHTTP Bot.[1]. We believe that Ovidiy author
reused the open-source code of the LiteHTTP Bot project.

If the stealer is able to find passwords from targeted applications, it will follow up its initial checkin with
another request reporting the passwords of targeted applications:
id: DiskID and ProcessorID
site: Website with saved credentials
program: Targeted application
login: Saved application username
pass: Saved application password
user: Registered Ovidiy Stealer username

Sales and Support
Ovidiy Stealer is offered for sale on ovidiystealer[.]ru, a domain which will help attract potential
customers and, as noted above, also the C&C domain. The malware boasts support, features, and login
access to the web panel. The admin panel for Ovidiy Stealer allows the botmaster to view statistics on
infected machines, view logs, build more stubs, and manage the account.

From the admin console, the botmaster has the capabilities to view and filter logs from infected
machines.

To simplify purchasing, the team behind Ovidiy Stealer uses a service known as 'RoboKassa' to collect
payment for new stubs. RoboKassa is a Russian equivalent to PayPal, allowing users to conduct
payment using credit cards and other types of payment to the sellers; in this case the seller is “Ovidiy”
(Fig. 11).

Like many other markets with many choices, the malware market is competitive and developers must
market the strengths and benefits of their products in order to attract buyers. To help drive sales, the
development team includes statistics on the progress of certain modules, and other plans for future
releases of the malware. In addition, the site includes “testimonials" from satisfied customers,
presumably to demonstrate to other would-be criminals that they can be profitable when using Ovidiy
Stealer.

Figure 12: Reviews and development progress. The user ACE’s comments translate to English as: “I
only need the stealer for burglary on order. I explain what it is: I accept an order for the hijacking of a
certain person's account. After I work with him and install the stealer. That's all, for one order I get 300500 rubles. Without this project it would be impossible! Thank you!”
The main author of this project goes by the handle "TheBottle," evident from the informational page of
the Ovidiy Stealer website. Moreover, the name 'TheBottle' is observed in at least one sample's PDB
string:
C:\Users\TheBottle\documents\visual studio 2017\Projects\Ovidiy\Ovidiy\obj\Debug\Ovidiy.pdb

Conclusion
Ovidiy Stealer is a new password stealer that entered the criminal ranks barely one month ago. While it
is not the most advanced stealer we have seen, marketing and an entry-level price scheme make it
attractive and accessible to many would-be criminals. Ovidiy Stealer is lightweight and simple enough to
work with relative ease, allowing for simple and efficient credential exfiltration. A lightweight, easy-touse, and effective product coupled with frequent updates and a stable support system give Ovidiy
Stealer the potential to become a much more widespread threat. Stolen credentials continue to be a
major risk for individuals and organizations, because password re-use can enable one stolen login to
compromise several more accounts, and the sale of stolen accounts continues to be a lucrative market
for criminal looking for quick profits. Ovidiy Stealer highlights the manner in the cybercrime marketplace
drives innovation and new entrants and challenges organizations that must keep pace with the latest
threats to their users, their data, and their systems.
