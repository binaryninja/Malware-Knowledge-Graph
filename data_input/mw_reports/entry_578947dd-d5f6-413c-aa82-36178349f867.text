Emotet malware was first identified in 2014 and its original purpose was to obtain banking
credentials and other sensitive information; however, the malware is regularly updated and
new functionality is added. Emotet malware is now one of the most prevalent and dangerous
malware threats faced by businesses.
The malware can detect whether it is running in a virtual environment and will generate false
indicators in such cases. The malware is polymorphic, which means it changes every time it
is downloaded. That makes it difficult to detect using the signature-based detection methods
employed by standard anti-virus software.
The malware also has worm-like features which allows it to rapidly spread to other networked
computers. Emotet is also capable of spamming and forwarding itself to email contacts. As if
infection with Emotet is not bad enough, it can also download other malware variants onto
infected devices.
Emotet malware is one of the most destructive malware variants currently in use and
cleaning up Emotet attacks can be incredibly costly. The Department of Homeland Security
has reported that some attacks on state, local, tribal, and territorial governments have cost
more than $1 million to resolve.
Emotet malware is primarily distributed via spam email, either through malicious attachments
or hyperlinks to websites where the malware is silently downloaded. The lures used in the
messages are highly varied and include most of the commonly used phishing lures such as
shipping notifications, fake invoices, payment requests, PayPal receipts.
Now the threat actors behind the malware have adopted a new tactic to increase infection
rates. Once installed on a device, the malware accesses email conversation threads and
forwards the message to individuals named in the thread.
The original email conversation is unaltered, but a hyperlink is added to the top of the
message. The link directs the recipient to a webpage where a file download is triggered.
Opening the document and enabling macros will see Emotet downloaded. Email attachments
may also be added to previous conversation threads in place of hyperlinks.
Since the messages come from a known individual with whom an email conversation has
taken place in the past, the probability of the document being opened is greater than if
messages come out of the blue or are sent from an unknown individual.

Several cybersecurity firms have identified a campaign using this tactic, including phishing
intelligence provider Cofense and security researcher Marcus Hutchins (MalwareTech).
The current campaign uses revived conversations from before November 2018, although
more recent conversations may be revived in further campaigns. Any revived old email
conversation that contains a link or an attachment could indicate a user has been targeted
and that at least one member of the email exchange has been infected with Emotet.
The current campaign is not only extensive, it is also proving to be extremely successful.
Spamhaus reports that there have been 47,000 new infections in the past two months alone,
while Cofense reports that it has identified more than 700,000 infections in the past 12
months.
Protecting against this dangerous malware requires a powerful anti-spam solution and good
security awareness training for staff. SpamTitanâ€™s new features can help to detect malicious
emails spreading Emotet malware to better protect businesses from attack.
