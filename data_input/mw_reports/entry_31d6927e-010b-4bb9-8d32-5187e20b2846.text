Python network worm that spreads on the local network and gives the attacker control
of these machines.
This code is not finished and works more like a "worm template" for you to get inspiration at
the moment.
You can bruteforce ssh servers, spread with USBs, etc..

Bruteforcing local machines with port 22 open.

Downloading necessary libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

Executing
Windows & Linux:
python worm.py

Compilation (.exe)
Targeted machines wonÂ´t probably have python and the required libraries installed. To run
this code on other machines, you need to convert it into an executable.
I recommend the Pyinstaller library.
To use it, simply write these commands in your terminal:
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller worm.py
