Hackers are deploying new Linux malware variants in cyberespionage attacks, such as a
new PingPull variant and a previously undocumented backdoor tracked as 'Sword2033.'
PingPull is a RAT (remote access trojan) first documented by Unit 42 last summer in
espionage attacks conducted by the Chinese state-sponsored group Gallium, also known as
Alloy Taurus. The attacks targeted government and financial organizations in Australia,
Russia, Belgium, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
Unit 42 continued to monitor these espionage campaigns and today reports that the Chinese
threat actor uses new malware variants against targets in South Africa and Nepal.

The Linux variant of PingPull is an ELF file that only 3 out of 62 anti-virus vendors currently
flag as malicious.
Unit 42 was able to determine it's a port of the known Windows malware by noticing
similarities in the HTTP communication structure, POST parameters, AES key, and the
commands it receives from the threat actor's C2 server.
The commands the C2 sends to the malware are indicated by a single uppercase character
in the HTTP parameter, and the payload returns the results to the server via a base64encoded request.
The parameters and corresponding commands are:
A – Get the current directory
B – List folder
C – Read text file
D – Write a text file
E – Delete file or folder
F – Read binary file, convert to hex
G – Write binary file, convert to hex
H – Copy file or folder
I – Rename a file
J – Create a Directory
K – Timestamp file with a specified timestamp in "%04d-%d-%d %d:%d:%d" format
M – Run command
Unit 42 comments that the command handlers used in PingPull match those observed in
another malware named 'China Chopper,' a web shell seen heavily used in attacks against
Microsoft Exchange servers.

Sword2023 details
Unit 42 also found a new ELF backdoor that communicated with the same command and
control server (C2) as PingPull.
This is a simpler tool with more basic functions like uploading files on the breached system,
exfiltrating files, and executing a command with "; echo <random number>\n" appended to it.
The echo command adds random data on the execution log, possibly to make analysis more
challenging or obfuscate its activity.
Unit 42 discovered a second Sword2023 sample associated with a different C2 address
impersonating the South African military.

The same sample was linked to a Soft Ether VPN address, a product that Gallium is known
to use in its operations.

The cybersecurity firm comments that this isn't a random choice, as in February 2023, South
Africa took part in joint military exercises with Russia and China.
In conclusion, Gallium continues to refine its arsenal and broadens its target range using the
new Linux variants of PingPull and the newly discovered Sword2023 backdoor.
Organizations must adopt a comprehensive security strategy to effectively counter this
sophisticated threat rather than relying solely on static detection methods.
