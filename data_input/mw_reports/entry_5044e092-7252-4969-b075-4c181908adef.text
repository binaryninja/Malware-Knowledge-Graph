CVE 2014-0322 Malware - Sakurel (Feb 21, 2014)
Description
The Dell SonicWall Threats Research Team has spotted the latest malware being served in the recent CVE
2014-0322 attack. We have already shared our analysis on the exploit behavior so we will now discuss the
behavior of the malware payload, Sakurel.
This malware has many features and contains multiple levels of embedded files. The malware ultimately seeks
to steal information and provide a backdoor to the infected system, and uses different modules to accomplish
its tasks.
The file that gets dropped after exploitation, 'stream.exe', has fairly basic dropper behavior. The file contains an
XOR-encoded binary which gets decoded and executed in memory.

The decoded malware contains additional embedded modules, including one that provides for privilege
escalation if the current user is not an administrator.

1/4

After checking if the current process is running as an administrator, the escalation module is extracted and
dropped with a .dat extension, then executed via 'rundll32'.

This DLL contains a well-known technique for escalating user privileges via the 'sysprep' tool. This uses a UAC
bypass which affects 32-bit versions Windows 7 and Windows 8.

Once the malware has administrator privileges, it extracts an OCX file from its resources and moves a copy of
its original dropped incarnation into "MicroMedia" underneath "%APPDATA%\Local\Temp" and creates the
following registry key to execute when the system boots up:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MicroMedia:
%APPDATA%\Local\Temp\MicroMedia\MediaCenter.exe

Once the malware has acquired sufficient access and achieved peristence on the machine, the Windows 'hosts'
file is modified to redirect a number of domains to IP addresses controlled by the attackers. These strings from
the binary show the domains the attackers are redirecting:

The following strings, which include command and control domains and paths, are encoded in the binary with
the XOR key 0x56:

Overall the main motive of this malware is to steal user credentials from the targeted domains. The malware
also provides full backdoor access to the system via the command and control structure. We will continue to
monitor this threat and provide updates on its capabilities.
Dell SonicWALL Gateway AntiVirus provides protection against this threat via the following signature:
GAV: Sakurel.EX (Trojan)
