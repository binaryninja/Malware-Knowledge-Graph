FORT MEADE, Md. –
To better enable defense against malicious cyber actors, U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber
National Mission Force has identified and disclosed multiple open-source tools that Iranian
intelligence actors are using in networks around the world.
These actors, known as MuddyWater in industry, are part of groups conducting Iranian
intelligence activities, and have been seen using a variety of techniques to maintain access
to victim networks.
MuddyWater is an Iranian threat group; previously, industry has reported that MuddyWater
has primarily targeted Middle Eastern nations, and has also targeted European and North
American nations.
MuddyWater is a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security
(MOIS). According to the Congressional Research Service, the MOIS “conducts domestic
surveillance to identify regime opponents. It also surveils anti-regime activists abroad

through its network of agents placed in Iran’s embassies."
Should a network operator identify multiple of the tools on the same network, it may indicate
the presence of Iranian malicious cyber actors.
Below are some technical aspects of how the threat actor could be leveraging malware in
networks.
These include side-loading DLLs in order to trick legitimate programs into running malware
and obfuscating PowerShell scripts to hide command and control functions. New samples
showing the different parts of this suite of tools are posted to Virus Total, along with
JavaScript files used to establish connections back to malicious infrastructure.

Previous PowGoop Sample:
These three samples are all part of the same PowGoop instance. They were
identified in a folder with several other legitimate executables and DLLs.
Goopdate.dll uses DLL side-loading to run when a the non-malicious executable
GoogleUpdate.exe is run. goopdate.dll will then de-obfuscate goopdate.dat,
which is a PowerShell script used to de-obfuscate and run config.txt. Config.txt is
a PowerShell script that establishes network communication with the PowGoop
C2 server. It uses a modified base64 encoding mechanism to send data to and
from the C2 server. The IP of the C2 server is often hardcoded in config.txt
Goopdate.dll hides comms with malicious cyber actors’ C2 servers by executing
with Google Update service.
Additional PowGoop DLL Side-Loading variants:
Uses same technique to de-obfuscate .dat file, which is a PowerShell script to
decode another PowerShell script with .txt file extension
This open source code has been used for espionage & ransomware-- libpcre2-80.dll & vcruntime140.dll (PowGoop variant) leverage different naming conventions
to avoid antivirus & manual detection.
Additional PowGoop Loader variants:
Any instances of these files may indicate an attacker in the network: Open-source
cyber research found PowGoop Loader variants in compromised networks, deobfuscating a PowerShell script that allows an attacker command and control
functions.
De-obfuscates .txt file, which is another PowerShell script and main C2
functionality

Additional PowGoop C2 Beacon variants:
These malware reach out from victim networks & contact malicious
infrastructure. If you see these files, MCAs are likely seeing their beacon too.
Each sample reaches out from the victim network and contacts malicious
infrastructure. If you see these files on the network, chances are they are seeing
their beacon as well.
JavaScript samples:
The samples issue a GET request to malicious servers. The JavaScripts are
associated with groups also employing PowGoop.
Mori Backdoor sample:
This sample is an indicator that a network has been compromised – this is the
Mori Backdoor and is employed by malicious cyber actors for espionage. This
malware uses DNS tunneling to communicate to its C2 infrastructure.
This sample is a likely Mori Backdoor. This sample utilizes regsvr32.dll to run.
Key IOCs are the creation of the Mutex 0x50504060 and creation of the registry
key HKLM\SOFTWARE\NFC
