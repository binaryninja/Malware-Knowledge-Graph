Blue Termite is one of the attacks that the attacker
group called "CloudyOmega (Claudio mega)” is
deployed. The targeted attacks-mail and malware have

been last fall, reported by Symantec and Trend Micro.

For example, in an e-mail that the source is "health
insurance union secretariat”, the file is attached that
was disguised as a Word document file "Notice of

health insurance”, actually a self-extracting executable




file (exe) at is, when will open this, infection with
malware of the body is executed in the back that Word
document of the dummy is displayed. And it initiates
communication with the attacker’s command server (C

& C servers) to perform activities such as information
theft.

According to Kaspersky Lab’s observation,
communication to the C & C server is generated from
last year September 18, 10, but in December there was
also time to more than 100 cases per day, then, calm
down. But later this year in April, it becomes active
again, that came out some days there are more 140

when many.

In addition, where it was classified communication
source of the IP address, but of which 27% were anti-
virus vendors and virtual environment for automatic
analysis, such as that carried out the malware analysis,
that 73% is occupied by the Japanese organization have
you found. It says that it only has to analyze about half
of the observed data in the Kaspersky Lab, still the




organization more than 300 locations in Japan, you
have to be the thing that has been invaded by this

malware.

Note that this figure are those based on the number
of unique IP addresses, it is going to be considered
when using multiple IP addresses at the same
organization. Also, its not always have evolved into
activities such as information theft at all say (do not
know), but, at least, malware is successful in the
invasion, C & C number organization of considerable
communication with the server has occurred I would

that there.

After
the

malware infection, it called for confirmation of
whether the environment is or attack. Directories and

files in the PC, and to reference the operation to that




process, and ends the activity if it is determined not to
be attacked. This corresponds the environment, such

as the above-mentioned anti-virus vendor.

On the other hand, if it is determined that it is
attacked, dropping hacking tools or similar, another
type of malware, the acquisition of internal network
management authority, in addition to performing
activities such as spread to other terminals, the type of
compromised tissue is also discriminated. Stealing
your mail account and browser session information if
it is determined that the news media, to try to steal
sensitive information such as a document file if it is

determined that that he except news agency.

Kaspersky at a press briefing, introduction and
content of the theft has been e-mail account
information from news organizations, energy-related,
defense-related, the case of sensitive information, such
as manufacturing. As a case that is likely to further the
most damage is large, it was introduced that there was
a case that had been access to the Windows system

directory in the information communication business.




And that in a business that provides cloud services,
believed to have been stolen until the administrator

authority of the mission-critical server body.

customer web site that is operating on its cloud service,
Blue Termite C & C server is installed a large number, it
is found that Kaspersky Lab has 80 reviews alone was

able to parse domain has been abused It is other,




domestic several thousand
domain in May point in time
you have to be in the hands of

the attacker.

C & C servers but were often
placed abroad far, Blue those domestic C & C servers in
Termite is used, the ratio is up to 93%. The
communication of malware that had penetrated into
the tissue, and that is difficult to judgment and cut off

by the standard of overseas server.

The Blue Termite information of cloud services
business who are under attack of, already it is assumed
has to offer from Kaspersky Lab to the police, that
should know at least the operators. However, at present
business who announced that its I have not even one

company.

In Kaspersky Lab, behavior after infection of these
malware, back doors and hacking tools are using, from
the commonality of the C & C server, cyber attacks on
this time discovered the Japan pension mechanism, a

series of Blue Termite that has continued from last fall




Description and was determined to be a part of the
attack. “Our will discard the confidence unfounded
such as okay, everyone recognizes the fact that there is

likely to be atarget,” it can be appealed the need.
