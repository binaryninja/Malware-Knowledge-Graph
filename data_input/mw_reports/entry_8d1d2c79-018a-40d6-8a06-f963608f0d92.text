Iran is honing its Facebook fakes, according to research.
SecureWorks

Before she disappeared from Facebook, Mia Ash was a fun-loving, young photographer who
used the world's biggest social network to showcase her work. Ash was popular too.
Stretching back to April 2016, she'd befriended a lot of individuals, as many as 500, with
similar interests. Her looks almost certainly helped her apparent popularity.
Ash was thrown off of Facebook earlier this year, though. Not for any obvious infraction. But
because Facebook had been handed proof by SecureWorks researcher Allison Wikoff that
convinced them Ash was a fake. Not only that, her persona has been tied by Wikoff to one of

Iran's busiest cyberespionage groups, known as OilRig.
Alongside profiles across LinkedIn and DeviantArt, Ash was one of the most developed fakes
Wikoff had ever seen in her years researching spy activity on the web. “What we’ve seen in
the past is just a fake LinkedIn profile, but this had LinkedIn, Facebook, a Blogger profile, two
domains, two email addresses, and WhatsApp. Traditionally we haven’t seen across the
board," Wikoff told Forbes.
According to the researcher, Ash was active shortly after a surge in hacker activity from
OilRig in December, as previously reported by Forbes. Using stolen images of a real young
woman from Romania, Ash reached out to an employee of a targeted organization in the
Middle East, the name of which SecureWorks isn’t reporting, sharing an interest in
photography, shifting initial contact from her LinkedIn profile with more than 500 connections
to her Facebook account. A relationship, albeit a fake one, was established, with chats over
WhatsApp too. (Forbes and SecureWorks have attempted to contact the woman whose
images were used, but with no success).
Eventually, she sent an email to the unwitting target, containing an Excel file, a supposed
survey to do with photography. She asked him to open it on his corporate network, which he
did. Then OilRig’s signature malware, known as PupyRAT, attempted to run and steal
passwords for the corporate network. Fortunately, in that case, the security products of the
organization sprung into action and prevented any data loss.
Despite the failure of the attack, Ash provides proof that OilRig has become adept at creating
fake online personas. Wikoff says Ash tried and in many cases succeeded in grooming a
range of technical individuals working for Middle East and Africa, most working in the oil and
gas field. She was convincing enough to befriend an oil and gas cybersecurity pro with 10
years experience, according to Wikoff.
Fake news from Iran?
But Ash was one of a large number of fake profiles developed by Iranian-linked hacker
groups over recent years, as they hone their craft. In recent months they've been
experimenting with fake news outlets too. A separate group believed to be of Iranian origin,
known as Charming Kitten, set up the blandly-named BritishNews, spamming a significant
amount of content earlier this year, up to a sudden stop in April, according to a report handed
to Forbes by Israeli security firm ClearSky.
The fake agency used stolen content from across the web and was designed to draw in
targets to visit the official BritishNews website, from where malware would be delivered. The
fake agency had a fake employee too. Again, LinkedIn was key to creating the persona,
though it's unclear just who Charming Kitten was trying to target with BritishNews.
The only employee of the fake BritishNews agency, according to ClearSky.

ClearSky

ClearSky also reported on another fake profile earlier this week, believed to have been
established by yet another Iranian-linked hacker crew called CopyKitten. Back in 2013, the
crew had set up a handful of Facebook profiles to spread links to a copy of Israeli news site
Haaretz. One Facebook fraud, named Amanda Morgan, was still active up to this month and
was also promoting a fake news service called Emet Press. No malware were delivered over
the sites and ClearSky believes they were only set up to establish trust. Most have now had
their social sites cut down, others simply remain dormant, said ClearSky head of intelligence
Eyal Sela.
Iran's use of personas isn't new. Historically, Iran's defense and intelligence units have long
been linked to social media-led campaigns. The Newscaster attacks of 2014, for instance,
saw myriad LinkedIn personas set up profiles posing as journalists. It's only the quality of the
fakes that's increasing.
Facebook response
For its part Facebook has been responsive to requests to remove fake profiles. Alex Stamos,
chief security officer for Facebook, told Forbes the company would be taking more of a
manual approach rather than relying on automated technologies for dealing with nation statesponsored fakes.
"A lot of that work ... is more about looking for the patterns of malicious behavior that are
expressed by those kinds of grooming attacks by advanced nation state adversaries,"
Stamos said. "That would be more of a manual process that's helped by automation."
With Iran not giving up on its social exploitation, expect that game of whack-a-mole to
continue.
