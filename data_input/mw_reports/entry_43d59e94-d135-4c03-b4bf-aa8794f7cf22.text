Introduction
State-sponsored cyberwarfare is no different than physical battles or terrorist attacks in terms of scope and damage.
Arguably, cyber attacks are much worse because the identity of attackers are easily concealed, slowing down any
process that could bring perpetrators to justice. Attackers are also not restricted by time and location. Interestingly,
Middle Eastern countries and some members of the European Union (EU) have recently figured in targeted attacks,
either as an aggressor or a victim, for seemingly political reasons.
At the recently concluded “31st Chaos Communication Congress of the Chaos Computer Club (31C3),” cybersecurity
researchers discussed the ways and means by which threat actors can use widely available software to cover their
tracks and carry out their campaigns. [1] The focus of this particular lecture was the GHOLE malware used in targeted
attack campaigns. GHOLE is believed to have been active since 2011 based on the compilation date of its oldest samples.
Targeted attacks are well-planned cyberthreat activities aimed at specific organizations. In this paper, we delve
into the malicious activities of a cyberthreat group, known in the cybersecurity industry as Rocket Kitten, which has
been hitting different public and private Israeli and European organizations. Rocket Kitten has so far launched two
campaigns—“GHOLE” malware attacks and one we have dubbed “Operation Woolen-GoldFish.” We named it as
such because “Woolen” is attributed to the malware developer and one of the threat actors behind this campaign;
“GoldFish” serves as an attribute to the location of origin with which the campaign was seemingly launched from.
The Rocket Kitten group used spear-phishing emails in order to penetrate their target systems. Based on the malware
samples we have obtained from files with macro malware specific to the GHOLE malware campaign, we found that
they were mostly interested in the defense industry, the IT sector, government entities, and academic organizations.
Certain details from the malware samples show that Operation Woolen-GoldFish was most likely to be a statesponsored campaign.

Victims and Targets
The content of the files we have collected from this group of attackers is quite straightforward. They contain
information that is very customized in relation to the target entity. Some files are written in German, while
others contain information specific to just one vertical. All of these have been used for spear-phishing emails
against various targets.
Seeing the content of these files, we suspect they have all been used for spear phishing against the following:
•

Civilian organizations in Israel

•

Academic organizations in Israel

•

German-speaking government organizations

•

European organizations

•

European private company

Rocket Kitten’s New Campaign Matures
The GHOLE Campaign
In February 2015, the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ received an alert from Europe that triggered
several targeted attack indicators related to a specific malware family, prompting our threat defense experts
to investigate further. The alert showed an infected Microsoft™ Excel® file that soon proved to have been
launched by Rocket Kitten. When a user opens the Excel file attachment in the spear-phishing attempt, a .DLL
file is dropped onto the system and is executed using a macro embedded in the file. Macros are small scripts
within files that are usually used to automate common repetitive tasks. However, these can also be used for
malicious intent, such as infecting machines of unsuspecting users with malware, just like in this situation.
Trend Micro detects the malware as TROJ_GHOLE.A. It is common for Rocket Kitten to use GHOLE in their
targeted attack campaigns. The dropped .DLL file (SHA1 hash: 07a77f8b9f0fcc93504dfba2d7d9d26246e5878f;
BKDR_GHOLE.B) is scanned on VirusTotal, but there were no results, raising further interest to analyze the
binary. [2‒3]
The .DLL file contained an export function named, “function,” instead of the usual, “gholee,” found in previous
samples from this malware family. We suspect that the attacker did this on purpose so the malware can bypass
detection and stay within the targeted system that would eventually give it more freedom to move laterally.

Export Function: Function
The top-right boxed code in the screenshot, displayed to the right, shows
an unusual code that uses “push” to pass values like those shown in the
screenshots below it. When passed to WINAPI, it will look like a string on
stack.
The first block contains the address of the command-and-control (C&C)
server of the malware, which is located at IP address, 83.170.33.60. This
value is specified in the code, as shown in the third screenshot.
The second boxed code in function, ZKXdu80x, is the client version. The
third is an encryption key with a length of 256 bytes (2,048 bits) used for
network communications, and starts with the pattern,
GET /index.php?c=xxxxxxxx&r=xxxxx&u=1&t=.
In all samples we have analyzed, the “c” argument is 8 bytes long and
differs across variants. This can be used as a unique identifier for each
of the infected machines. The “r” argument has a variable length, 5–7
bytes; the “u” argument is always 1 byte long.
Other communication patterns can be found in the binary and can be
used as indicators of compromise:
•

index.php?c=%s&r=%lx

•

index.php?c=%s&r=%lx&u=1&t=%s

•

index.php?c=%s&r=%x

Related Samples
We found several Microsoft Office® files containing variants of the GHOLE malware family that were used to
infect machines. As the Excel spreadsheet used in this campaign is disguised to look relevant and important,
users were prompted to open it and execute the embedded macro. The use of macros to infect computers is
deemed amateur. This shows that there is a gap between the maturity of the malware, which is good enough
for its purpose, and the way it is delivered, which raises questions about the attackers’ professional capacity.
We decided to look at the spear-phishing attempts from a wider perspective and analyzed more samples from
this malware family. Based on available evidence, only the Rocket Kitten group is known to have used GHOLE
in the attacks related to Operation Woolen-GoldFish. It is interesting to note that the GHOLE malware is in fact
a modified CORE IMPACT® product. CORE IMPACT is a sophisticated penetration-testing tool from CORE, a
legitimate company. [4]

After studying the sample infected and dropped files, we established a timeline using the dates when the
executable files were compiled. This timeline should be reliable unless the attackers played with the time
stamps, which would be surprising in this campaign since all binary compilation dates fit quite well with the
spear-phishing attacks.
As is often the case with malware families specifically used in targeted attacks, there are actually very few
different samples in the wild, compared with traditional cybercrime malware.

Number of malware samples compiled

The Microsoft Office files used by the attackers to infiltrate their targets’ networks are also very interesting
because they contain metadata. Metadata can be defined as “the information about the information,” which
in this case is the information pertaining to the file itself. Some of details of the available metadata were
useful, particularly, the creation date, modification date, author, and last modification author. We will tackle the
metadata later on in this paper.

Use of Malware Scanner
During the course of this investigation, we found out that some samples of the GHOLE malware have been
submitted to an online-malware-scanning site, av.zerodays.ir, to estimate the detection rate of their malware.
[5] Three samples appeared to have been scanned using this service before they appeared elsewhere. One
sample was submitted 26 days before it was scanned in other online malware analysis service sites. This
led us to believe that the malware controllers submitted the original samples to the av.zerodays.ir system
themselves. We would like to point out that the av.zerodays.ir online service is free and available to everyone
on the Internet. We contacted a representative of the company, who in turn told us that they “do not condone
cybercrime or in any way affiliated to any entity that could have been part of this campaign.”

GHOLE Malware Communication and Control
The communications established by this malware family from an infected workstation
to the C&C server are done by directly communicating with the IP addresses hardcoded in the binaries, as seen in the export function display. There were no domain
names involved in this campaign. We were able to obtain a list of C&C servers, which
are mostly hosted in Germany, via a satellite communication service provider known
as Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (IABG): [6]
•

83.170.33.37

•

83.170.33.60

•

83.170.43.67

•

83.170.33.80

•

84.11.26.230

•

84.11.75.220

•

84.11.146.55

The last IP address, 84.11.146.55, was associated with one malware sample. It belongs
to IABG with only the following information available:
•

inetnum: 84.11.146.0 - 84.11.146.255

•

netname: DE-IABG-TELEPORT-ERTEBATAT

•

descr: IABG - Teleport customer Ertebatat

•

country: DE

The other IP addresses were used by different malware samples. These IP addresses
also belonged to IABG and could all be connected to the same customer. In fact, all of
the IP ranges on which these C&C servers are identified belonged to one customer,
who rents the following IP ranges from IABG:
•

84.11.26.224–84.11.26.255

•

84.11.37.128–84.11.37.159

•

84.11.75.192–84.11.75.255

•

83.170.33.32–83.170.33.63

•

83.170.33.64–83.170.33.95

•

Joinebiz.com was an e-business solution provider that ceased to operate in 2006. Incidentally, it held office in
Isfahan, Iran, which is the country Mr. Mehdi Mahdavi used as reference for renting the IP ranges used by the
GHOLE malware.
These details can loosely be tied to the entities presented above but caution is strongly advised because the
names are quite common. We have yet to determine if these names belong to one person, if the same person
is the one who rents IP ranges from IABG, if his servers were compromised and used as proxy servers, or if he
provides part of his infrastructure to the Operation Woolen-GoldFish targeted attack group.

Operation Woolen-GoldFish: Rocket
Kitten’s New Campaign
Point of Entry
Sending out spear-phishing emails is a common
technique used as a point of entry in the initial stage
of compromise. It is, in fact, still widely used in
attempts to gain privileges in targeted companies’
systems. Several social engineering tricks can be
used to make a user click a link or open a file.
One of the spear-phishing emails sent out by the
Rocket Kitten group looked like a simple office
correspondence.

Sample spear-phishing email used by the group
in 2014

The attachment was a Microsoft Office file. User
participation is needed to execute the macros in the
file. If the user does not run the macros, the computer
will not be infected by the GHOLE malware. By the
end of 2014, however, we saw significant changes
in the attack behavior of the Rocket Kitten group in
terms of spear-phishing campaigns and malware
infection scheme. The second spear-phishing email
sample has been sent to one target in Israel.
This email sample was sent sometime in February
2015. This also used the identity of a recognized
Israeli engineer. We anonymized the email address,
as well as the OneDrive™ link. We also removed the
signature used in it.
A known figure in the Israeli defense field was used
in a similar tactic with the same email content. The
decoy file used an Adobe® .PDF file instead of a
Microsoft PowerPoint™ presentation. The .PDF file
was a Web article from the Washington Post. The file
showed “pc12” as the author and the last modifier.

Initial Compromise
The attackers used a OneDrive link in their campaign. OneDrive is a free online cloud
storage system from Microsoft that comes with several gigabytes of data storage
capacity.
The OneDrive link leads to an archive file containing a file named, “Iran’s Missiles
Program.ppt.exe.” This file, which has been taken offline, used the PowerPoint
icon but was really an executable file. The attackers probably decided to store their
malicious binaries online rather than sent them as an attachment to bypass email
detection.
Once executed, the file drops a nonmalicious PowerPoint file used as a decoy
file, while silently infecting the system with a variant of the CWoolger keylogger.
We decided not to show the content of this file given the sensitivity of the persona
impersonated in this social engineering lure.
We tried to look for this decoy file on the Internet but it was nowhere to be found,
which was quite surprising. We compared the metadata on this file with the other
files authored by the spoofed engineer and it showed the same exact file properties,
particularly the way the “author” field was written. The file also shows a “Last modified
by:” field containing the information pc12.

Malware binary

Rocket Kitten has signed pc12 at the last modified section of some of the files used
in their spear-phishing activities. We do not know if this string refers to one Rocket
Kitten member or to a third party, who could have edited the files. The latter is very
unlikely though, since it has been used both in campaigns and files aimed at different
targets. We believe pc12 is, indeed, an indicator of Rocket Kitten activities.
We have a strong suspicion, based on the PowerPoint file, that the spoofed
engineer’s computer was compromised by the Rocket Kitten group because he
presents an interesting profile and is well-known in his field. Therefore, the file sent to
other Israeli targets could have been stolen directly from this person’s computer.

Possible Attribution
Wool3n.H4t
Cybercriminals quite often forget about metadata, which is generated by the software
they use to produce or modify the files. Those who are more meticulous alter this
information to lead investigators to false tracks.

As seen above, different authors worked on these files. Wool3n.H4t seemed to be the main author who
collaborated with aikido1 and Hoffman. No particular information could be found on aikido1 and Yusi, the
supposed partners of Wool3n.h4t. There were also times when Wool3n.H4t used U.S. and U.K. country codes
as last modification information. The most recent modification in the two PowerPoint files told us that W00l3n.H4t
slowly changed his infecting methods around October 2014.
There was not much information on Wool3n.H4t, which is not a common nickname, on the Internet. However,
we found that this nickname owned an inactive blog hosted by a free service in Iran and was registered in
several underground hacking forums. The blog only contained two posts signed by Masoud_pk, which could be
part of the real identity of Wool3nh4t. Masoud is the one of the top 50 commonly used first names in Iran.

Wool3n.H4t’s Recent Activities: CWoolger Keylogger
One malware sample (SHA1 hash: d5b2b30fe2d4759c199e3659d561a50f88a7fb2e; detected as TSPY_
WOOLERG.A) surfaced as we tried to look for more information on Wool3n.H4t. [7] We took interest in this
because the binary contained the following debug string:
•

C:\Users\Wool3n.H4t\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\C-CPP\CWoolger\Release\CWoolger.pdb

Debug strings are strings that are sometimes left behind in binaries, revealing information about the developer
behind the code. This debug string shows us that the binary was compiled by a user account named
“Wool3n.H4t,” and that the project behind this code was dubbed “CWoolger.”
This malware is a keylogger, although from a technical point of view, it is not as advanced as its
contemporaries. The malware also embedded some File Transfer Protocol (FTP) credentials of the attackers in
clear text in the binary.
Consistent with the other malware used by the threat actors involved in Operation Woolen-GoldFish, the C&C
reference is hard-coded as an IP address in the binary. A domain name was not used. Moreover, it lands on the
system with a name, which is very similar to some GHOLE malware variants, NTUSER.dat{…}.exe.
The malware starts by creating a mutex called “woolger” and creates a copy of itself, %TEMP%\NTSuser.exe,
in the TEMP folder before executing it. It creates a VBScript in the same folder named “wsc.vbs.”

The script installs the persistence mechanism of the malware, a link named, “WinDefender,” in the startup

It then enables keylogging by calling the SetWindowsHookExW application programming interface (API) and
calls SetTimer API to prepare a timer job for uploading the log files.

Once the machine is infected, the keylogger records all keystrokes in %temp%/wlg.dat using the following

The upload function of this malware ran at specific intervals based on a previous random value. If the log file is
larger than 3,000 bytes, an uploadToCnC function will be called to transfer the log file via FTP.

Upload function

The C&C server reached in our sample is 107.6.181.116, which belongs to SingleHop (AS32475). The
credentials used to connect with the FTP server are hard-coded in clear text in the binary. When the file is sent
to the server, it is renamed using the following format:

Conclusion
Operation Woolen-GoldFish is alive and active. From a technical point of view, the threat actors involved in
this campaign are less mature in terms of technical capacity and tactic sophistication compared with other
targeted attack groups we are monitoring, yet they are improving and gaining traction. The spear-phishing
email attacks are getting a little more aggressive and now have less user interaction at the point of entry.
Nevertheless, it is unfortunately not because an attacker is inferior in skills that there are fewer victims.
Operation Woolen-GoldFish has managed to successfully infiltrate several companies and organizations in
Israel and Europe. One PowerPoint file used as a lure in spear-phishing attempts seems to indicate that the
group has successfully victimized one well-known engineer in Israel and used one of his unreleased files
as bait. Time and again, lack of proper security understanding and implementation has led individual and
corporate users around the world to fall victim to creative malicious activities of threat actors. Threat actors
are also known to be multiskilled.
In this case, we were able to confirm that Wool3n.H4t was not only responsible for most of the infecting Office
files used, but was also capable of developing malware. The discovery of the CWoolger keylogger compiled
on 7 February 2015 may be the strongest indication that this targeted attack group, where Woole3n.H4t seems
to a part of, is very active and may be developing its own malware. With Wool3n.H4t as both the malware
developer and infrastructure controller, it can be loosely deducted that the group comprise of very few people.
Seeing the evolution of this targeted attack group, we believe its members, especially Wool3n.H4t, are
traditional or old-fashioned cybercriminals. This assumption is based on the way the campaign spreads and
evolves, including the use of nicknames and password used by Wool3n.H4t, which indicates that he rather
comes from an underground hacking group. This campaign, like the first one the group launched, shows
that the targeted entities do have a particular interest for the Islamic Republic of Iran. While motives behind
targeted attack campaigns may differ, the end results are one and the same—shift in power control, either
economically or politically.
The authors would like to thank Ilja Lebedev for his valuable input in this research.
