Want to learn more about the sanctions against Suex and what this means for the
larger fight against ransomware? Watch Chainalysis investigators and U.S. Treasury
executives discuss the Suex investigation and new OFAC guidance on sanctions risk
for ransomware payments now.
Today, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that Russiabased cryptocurrency Over The Counter (OTC) broker Suex was designated pursuant to
Executive Order 13694 and added to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons (SDN) List, thereby prohibiting Americans from doing business with the company.
We are proud to share that Chainalysis tools aided in the investigation of Suex.
Since opening its doors in 2018, Suex has moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
cryptocurrency, mostly in Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether, much of which is from illicit and high-risk
sources. In Bitcoin alone, Suex’s deposit addresses hosted at large exchanges have
received over $160 million from ransomware actors, scammers, and darknet market
operators. Chainalysis’ investigation reveals that the OTC is converting cryptocurrency into
cash at physical branches located in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and possibly also at other
offices outside of Russia as well. Suex is also found to have received over $50 million worth

of Bitcoin sent from addresses hosted at illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2018
through 2021, well after BTC-e was shut down by U.S. authorities for its own money
laundering activity on behalf of cybercriminals.
Chainalysis has been tracking Suex’s money laundering activity for some time now.
Following this investigation, we can reveal that multiple Suex addresses are included in the
group of 273 service deposit addresses we identified as receiving 55% of all funds sent from
illicit addresses in 2020 in our most recent Crypto Crime Report. Suex addresses also
appear in the Rogue 100, a list of 100 OTC deposit addresses we identified as belonging to
major money laundering facilitators in 2019.
Today’s designation is important because it represents significant action taken by the U.S.
government to combat the money launderers who make all other forms of cryptocurrencybased crime profitable. As we discussed in our most recent Crypto Crime Report, a very
small group of illicit services facilitates the majority of the money laundering for all
cryptocurrency-based crime. Suex is one of the biggest and most active of those services.
Shutting them down would represent a significant blow to many of the biggest cyber threat
actors operating today, including leading ransomware attackers, scammers, and darknet
market operators.

Who is Suex?
Suex is a cryptocurrency OTC broker legally registered in the Czech Republic. However, it
has no known physical presence there and instead operates out of branch offices in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, as well as other locales in and around Russia and in the Middle East.
Suex claims it can convert cryptocurrency holdings into cash at these branch locations and
even facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrency for physical assets like real estate, cars, and
yachts.

Suex’s blockchain footprint
Suex operates as a nested service, meaning it operates using addresses hosted by larger
exchanges in order to tap into those exchanges’ liquidity and trading pairs. While many
nested services are legitimate, some exchanges don’t hold nested services to high enough
compliance standards, meaning they can be exploited for money laundering.
Blockchain analysis reveals that Suex has received tens of millions worth of cryptocurrency
payments from addresses associated with several forms of cybercrime, as well as from
addresses associated with the now-shuttered exchange BTC-e. While Suex’s activity
spanned several cryptocurrencies, we’ll dive more into its Bitcoin transaction history below
using Chainalysis Reactor.

Suex has received over $481 million in Bitcoin alone since becoming active in February
2018, based on the value at the time of transfers. Those transfers include substantial funds
received from cybercriminals. Specifically, Suex has received:
Nearly $13 million from ransomware operators including Ryuk, Conti, Maze, and
several others
Over $24 million from cryptocurrency scam operators including the fraudsters
behind Finiko, a scam that took in over $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency from victims
primarily in Russia and Ukraine
Over $20 million from darknet markets, primarily the Russia-based Hydra Market

Additionally, Suex received over $50 million worth of cryptocurrency from addresses
associated with BTC-e, an illicit cryptocurrency exchange shut down by authorities in 2017
for facilitating large-scale money laundering on behalf of cybercriminals.

Interestingly, the transfers from BTC-e to Suex took place well after BTC-e was shuttered,
with some occurring as recently as this year. We believe Suex may have processed these
transfers on behalf of BTC-e administrators, associates, or former users attempting to
liquidate cryptocurrency trapped at the exchange. Our analysis of Suex’s blockchain activity
combined with proprietary investigative techniques suggests to us that the OTC carried out
cryptocurrency-for-cash exchanges on behalf of users at its Moscow and St. Petersburg
branch locations, but possibly at others as well.

Chainalysis has labeled these addresses in all of our products as being associated with a
sanctioned entity and today will be alerting any customers with any exposure to these
addresses.

A big win in the fight against money laundering
Shutting down cryptocurrency-based money launderers is one of the most important
strategies to combat cryptocurrency-related crime. It all comes down to incentives. If
cybercriminals have no way of moving ill-gotten cryptocurrency to services where it can be
stored safely or converted into cash, there’s much less reason for them to use
cryptocurrency in the first place. A small group of illicit services facilitate the majority of
cryptocurrency-based money laundering, and Suex is one of the worst offenders, so today’s
action represents a positive step forward in the fight against cybercrime. We commend
OFAC for making this designation and look forward to working with our partners in the public
and private sectors to continue the fight against money laundering service providers.
