This report presents the recommendations of
the Partnership against Cybercrime Working
Group as a first step towards establishing a
global architecture for cooperation.

Cybercrime is a global threat that should concern
every decision-maker, whether at the corporate or
national level. According to the World Economic
Forum Global Risks Report 2020, over the next 10
years, cyberattacks will be the second greatest
risk businesses will face.1 While nation state cyber
activities tend to garner the most international
attention, cybercriminals are responsible for the
majority of malicious activity on the internet –
cybercrime is estimated at about 80%.2 As a
result, reducing cyber risk means reducing and
mitigating cybercrime.

Traditionally, governments have been responsible
for combating crime. However, the unique realm
of cyberspace has proved that governments do
not and will not have all the capabilities needed to
combat the cybercrime threat alone. In fact, many
of the required capabilities reside in the private
sector, such that private companies must be part
of the solution. Enabling stronger operational
collaboration between the private and public
sectors at the global level and combining their
resources and capabilities are therefore crucial
elements in reducing the risk posed by cybercrime.
Various significant collaborative initiatives exist, but

mutual interests and benefits of working together
towards a shared goal. The members of the World
Economic Forum Partnership against Cybercrime
Working Group engaged in a series of virtual yet
intense discussions that resulted in the three main
recommendations presented in this report. The
approach chosen for this initiative was not only to
understand the challenges, but to design forwardlooking and action-oriented solutions.
The first two sections of this report present the
challenge of cybercrime and the need to foster
public-private cooperation. The third and fourth
sections lay out the principles and considerations
formulated by the working group to support
collaborative action against cybercrime. The final
section outlines a potential global architecture to
increase existing efforts and facilitate the required
cooperation.
This report highlights the commitment of an
engaged, purpose-driven multistakeholder
community that continues to develop and
implement these concepts with the aim of reducing
cybercrime globally. We hope it will encourage other
like-minded individuals and organizations to join us
in advancing this critical mission.

The World Economic Forum created the Partnership
against Cybercrime initiative to address this global
challenge by exploring ways to amplify publicprivate cooperation against cybercrime and
overcome existing barriers to cooperation. The
initiative brought together key private and public
stakeholders, including leading law enforcement
agencies, international organizations, cybersecurity
companies, service and platform providers, global
corporations and leading not-for-profit alliances.

Foreword
A public-private partnership against cybercrime
is the only way to gain an edge over
cybercriminals. This report provides key insights
on how to achieve this together.

Of all the types of crime, cybercrime continues
to increase at the fastest rate. According to
INTERPOL’s recent assessment of the global
cyberthreat landscape,3 cybercriminals are
developing and boosting their attacks at an
alarming pace, exploiting the fear and uncertainty
caused by the unstable social, economic and
health situation around the world.
Jürgen Stock
Secretary-General
International Criminal Police
Organization (INTERPOL),
Lyon

While crimes such as burglary and assault are
more visible, cybercrime is largely hidden, leading
many people to underestimate its actual damage
or the likelihood of becoming a victim. But the
effects of cybercrime can be just as devastating as
physical crimes, impacting numerous individuals
and organizations everywhere.
To address this threat, we must create barriers
to entry, such as raising the cost of engaging
in criminal activities and the overall risk for
cybercriminals. Law enforcement agencies
worldwide are actively investigating cybercrimes
with the aim of prosecuting cybercriminals.

INTERPOL, through its Global Cybercrime
Programme, is facilitating law enforcement
cooperation and promoting police capacities in the
field of cyber. But this is not enough.
Against cybercrime, the solution can only come
from public-private cooperation. The private
sector plays a fundamental role in the ability to
understand and act against cybercriminals. Only
by ensuring that leading companies work side
by side with law enforcement can we effectively
respond to the cybercrime threat.
The World Economic Forum is well positioned
to promote this cooperation. With INTERPOL
and other primary stakeholders from the
private and public sectors, it has devised the
recommendations presented in this report.
Implementing them and continuing to work
together through the Partnership against
Cybercrime will drive momentum to amplify
collaboration in our joint fight against cybercrime.

Executive summary
The public and private sectors must work
together to fight cybercrime. To do so, each
needs to embrace effective ways of working
together and foster needed alliances.

Cybercrime impacts everyone, from individuals
to global corporations and critical infrastructures
or governments. It causes immense, though not
always visible, damage to economies and societies.
It drastically undermines the benefits of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, increases inequality and
hinders international cyber stability efforts.
As in the case of any other crime, systematic
containment efforts against cybercrime must
also include actions against the sources of the
threat. This can only be achieved through stronger
operational collaboration between the private and
public sectors, leveraging private companies’
unique position and capabilities in this field. While
various significant collaborative initiatives exist, they
remain fragmented and insufficient for current needs
and an ever-evolving cybercrime threat landscape.
Following the 2016 work on Recommendations
for Public-Private Partnership against Cybercrime,
the World Economic Forum’s Partnership against
Cybercrime initiative was launched in January
2020 to explore ways to amplify public-private
collaboration in cybercrime investigations and initiate
a paradigm shift in the way to collectively deal with
the growing impact of cybercrime. The initiative’s
working group included more than 50 representatives
from leading public and private organizations.
This report presents the recommendations of the
Partnership against Cybercrime Working Group in
three areas:

–

Systematizing cooperation

–

Ensuring value for participation in the
cooperation

–

Respecting concerns and challenges

Taking collaborative action to disrupt
cybercrime ecosystems
The working group also emphasized the need to
explore the full spectrum of possible courses of
action to raise the costs and risk for cybercriminals,
leveraging the respective expertise and capabilities
of both the public and private sectors. Specifically,
potential coordinated measures to disrupt and
dismantle criminal activities at scale are insufficiently
used. A decision to participate in such operations
should not be made lightly, but organizations should
not be paralysed by inaction. The Group highlighted
key considerations for decision-makers in assessing
these actions, to maximize the likelihood of success
and minimize unnecessary risks.
Partnering to combat global cybercrime
To increase existing efforts and fully harness the
power of the private sector, facilitating sustainable
and effective cooperation, the working group
recommends launching a three-level system
comprised of:
–

A global partnership, building on the existing
Forum initiative, to bring together international
stakeholders to provide an overarching narrative
and commitment to cooperate; foster interaction
within a global network of entities that drive
efforts to fight cybercrime; and facilitate
strategic dialogues and processes aiming to
support cooperation and overcome barriers in
the long term.

–

Permanent Nodes, a global network of existing
organizations that strive to facilitate publicprivate cooperation over time.

–

Threat Focus Cells, short-term, mission-driven
groups of partners that engage in concrete,
operational, cooperative efforts. These cells will be
hosted and maintained by the Permanent Nodes.

Promoting principles for public-private
cooperation to combat cybercrime
The working group defined six principles, to be
endorsed by both law enforcement and private
companies, which can enable sustainable,
repeatable and effective cooperation:
–

Embracing a shared narrative for collective
action against cybercrime

–

Cooperating on the basis of long-term strategic
alignment

–

Undertaking trust-building behaviours

The global challenge
of cybercrime

1.1 The impact of cybercrime
An estimated 4.66 billion people around the world
currently use the internet,4 a number that has tripled
in the past 12 years as connectivity has become
more accessible, and that will continue to increase.
Our reliance on the use of computers and technology
has changed the way we conduct business,
communicate and socialize, and technology is an
indispensable part of all facets of life.
Humans are increasingly dependent on the internet,
yet our efforts to protect people, data, devices
and the infrastructure of the internet itself from
cybercriminals have not matched the threat they
pose. Cyber criminals steal an estimated $600
billion per year from governments, companies
and individuals,5 while the overall loss of company
revenues over the course of five years, from 2019
to 2023, will reach $5.2 trillion.6 In fact, cybercrime
is one of the most disruptive and economically
damaging criminal activities. Not only does it cause
substantial financial damages and pose a serious
threat to society and the global economy, it also
has indirect effects in undermining the public’s
confidence in digital transformation and overall trust
in technology.
Our connected world has become a lucrative
playground for cybercriminals who can launch
attacks on victims in multiple countries and
jurisdictions with little fear of being caught. They
use malicious software programs and technical
infrastructure to steal funds, intellectual property
and sensitive personal information. They carry out
attacks on individual users, networks and corporate
systems to engage in an enormous amount of
fraudulent and destructive activity. The tools and

services available to criminals as part of the crimeas-a-service model, which lowers the entry barrier
to committing cybercrime and provides relatively
sophisticated cyber capabilities to almost anyone
who is willing to pay, are also significantly increasing
the growing impact of cybercrimes.
The cybercrime threat landscape is quite diverse
and dynamic. Threat actors range from individuals,
to loosely connected cross-national collectives,
to large organizations that in many cases enjoy a
degree of support, tolerance or even direction from
nation states. Cybercriminals abuse encryption,
cryptocurrencies, anonymity services and other
technologies. Financially motivated cybercriminals
constantly innovate to increase their profits. In
addition to financial crimes, criminals use internetbased infrastructure to uphold terrorism and drug
trafficking, and spread disinformation to destabilize
governments and democracies.7
At the macro level, cybercrime is an enormous
barrier to digital trust, greatly undermining
the benefits of cyberspace and hindering
international cyber stability efforts. In addition,
cybercrimes increase global inequality, putting
both the corporations and governments with fewer
resources at higher risk of falling prey to these
activities. Developing countries with weak legal
and enforcement regimes as well as inadequate
capacity to mitigate cyberthreats are particularly
exposed to these crimes. If not mitigated,
cybercrimes could undermine these countries’
efforts to formalize their economies using digital
technologies, negatively impacting the anticipated
digital dividends.

Cybercrime and COVID-19
Cybercriminals are developing and boosting
their attacks at an alarming pace, exploiting the
fear and uncertainty caused by the unstable
social and economic situation caused by
COVID-19 around the world. At the same time,
the higher dependency on connectivity and
digital infrastructure due to the need for physical
distancing further expands the avenues of cyber
intrusion and attack.
To maximize their financial gain and intended
damage, cybercriminals are shifting gears to
target businesses, governments and critical
infrastructure that play a crucial role in responding
to the outbreak. Concurrently, due to the sudden
global shift to teleworking, organizations have
had to rapidly deploy remote systems, networks
and applications. As a result, criminals are taking
advantage of the increased security vulnerabilities
arising from remote working to steal data, make
profits or cause disruption.

This occasion has also offered an irresistible
opportunity for threat actors to perpetuate
cybercrime on a global scale. Social engineering
campaigns using corporate logos have preyed on
the fear, uncertainty and doubt of unsuspecting
users.
INTERPOL’s COVID-19 Cybercrime Analysis
Report reveals several trends emerging as a result
of the crisis, including:
–

Online scams and phishing: Threat actors
have revised their usual online scams and
phishing schemes. By deploying COVID-19
themed phishing emails, often impersonating
government and health authorities,

cybercriminals entice victims to provide their
personal data and download malicious content.
Around two-thirds of member countries that
responded to the global cybercrime survey
reported the significant use of COVID-19 themes
for phishing and online fraud since the outbreak.
–

Disruptive malware: A spike in ransomware
attacks by multiple threat groups that had been
relatively dormant for the past few months
took place in the first two weeks of April
2020. Investigations show that the majority of
attackers accurately estimated the maximum
amount of ransom they could demand from
targeted organizations.

–

Malicious domains: With the increased
demand for medical supplies and information
on COVID-19, cybercriminals have significantly
multiplied registrations of domain names
containing such keywords as “coronavirus” or
“COVID”. In June 2020, 200,000 suspected
malicious domains existed, affecting more than
80 countries around the world.

Europol’s series of reports have revealed similar
trends in European Union member states, including
more targeted attacks on the healthcare sector.
The agency’s reports also document the criminals’
ability to adapt to the crisis, as demonstrated by
the surge of counterfeit and fake products on
darknet marketplaces, including COVID-19 test
kits, masks and pharmaceuticals. In parallel, they
also point to an increase in the amount of child
abuse materials available on the darknet as well as
in the access of illegal websites.

1.2 The first steps to success
The primary solution to lowering the risk of
cybercrime is to increase the cyber resilience of
potential victims, meaning all internet-connected
organizations and users. While resilience has been
the main focus of the cybersecurity market, law
enforcement agencies are also supporting these
efforts, by raising awareness8 and providing alerts,9
advice and best practices.10
There are reasons to be optimistic on this frontier.
Recent research shows an improvement in private
companies’ approaches to prioritizing cyber hygiene
and increasing investments in cyber resilience.11
This is also reflected in the growth of cyber
insurance markets.12 The cybersecurity market also
continues to grow, boosted by huge investments
in innovation, including harnessing such advanced

technologies as machine learning, robotic process
automation and cutting-edge encryption and
mathematical methods.
While cybersecurity efforts are mostly driven by
market forces, more and more private companies
are cooperating with other companies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), significantly
increasing the overall capacity to address
cyberthreats. This includes initiatives usually aimed
at reducing the impact of the cybercrimes on their
victims. Leading examples are the Cybercrime
Support Network,13 which helps individuals and
businesses affected by cybercrimes deal with the
challenges, and Scamadviser,14 which serves as
a global warning list of online scams with 2 million
sites added every month by more than 50 partners.

The victims of cybercrime
Due to the ever-increasing number of internet users
worldwide, the risk and impact of cybercrime on
individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) globally are massive. Identity theft,
romance scams, ransomware and business email
compromise are costing consumers and SMEs
billions with few resources available for prevention,
response and recovery. Cybercrime victims need
a clear path to get support, just as victims of
physical crimes currently have. Unfortunately, few
countries have such services, notably the United

Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Israel, where
citizens and businesses can call one central phone
number or online service to report an incident and
receive advice on how to respond and recover.
Governments and law enforcement agencies
need to define mandates for and ownership of the
response. By increasing reporting and recovery
resources, countries can decrease crime and
revictimization. The process needs to be clear for
victims, in line with a comprehensive response plan
created by governments to support them.

Several initiatives aim to make it harder for
cybercriminals to operate and some reduce their
potential rewards. The Europol-led No More
Ransom!15 project is a good example of a publicprivate initiative aimed at frustrating the cybercriminal
business model and ultimately reducing criminal

financial gain. Other efforts, such as the Global
Cyber Alliance16 created by the New York County
District Attorney and the City of London Police
Commissioner, focus on disrupting cybercriminals
and the vulnerabilities they seek to exploit.

The global threat of ransomware
Ransomware is a fast-evolving threat. Five
years ago, most ransomware attacks, with
some notable exceptions, were random with a
small ransom designed to entice payment. This
strategy evolved into a business model in which
customer service agents assist people with
the purchase of ransomware services and the
deposit of cryptocurrency profits, and ensure that
decryption keys work, to protect their reputation.
More recently, ransomware is targeted at specific
organizations with large, customized demands
based on perceived affordability. The malware
itself is now more sophisticated, designed to act

and spread quickly and even exfiltrate people’s
data as added leverage for extortion. The “honour”
among thieves that kept targets like hospitals and
critical infrastructure off the target list seems to
have crumbled. The best defence for ransomware
is preparation: presume you will get hit, back up
your information resources, ensure continuity of
operations in disruptions to the computer systems,
and drill your response. Form your team in advance
and include legal, technical and law enforcement
members to connect you with initiatives, such as
Europol’s “No More Ransom!”, that have a cache
of free decryption tools and keys.

Nevertheless, as security and users are not perfect,
cybercrime cannot be completely prevented.
Cybercriminals have proven highly adept at
exploiting the digital ecosystem; the risk of getting
caught remains very low due to the anonymity
offered by the internet and the jurisdictional
challenges of nationalized legal systems, whereas
the potential returns are very high. Moreover,
the profits from these malicious activities allow
continuous improvements in the criminals’

capabilities that often surpass the cybersecurity
investments made by their targets.
In the long run, in order to reduce the global
impact of cybercrime and to systematically
restrain cybercriminals, cybercrime must
be confronted at its source by raising the
cost of conducting cybercrimes, cutting the
activities’ profitability and deterring criminals by
increasing the direct risk they face.

1.3 Law enforcement against cybercrime
Law enforcement agencies worldwide are already
engaging in commendable efforts to address this
threat. Countless examples of successful action
exist, although the general public is not usually
aware of them.17
Yet law enforcement agencies still face numerous
challenges as they adjust to fast-evolving digital
crimes. One key difficulty is limited visibility and the
lack of information. Cybercrimes are likely to not be
reported at all.18,19 This situation is made worse by the
anonymity and transnational nature of cybercrimes,
combined with a lack of common terminology and
classification of what constitutes cybercrime.

BOX 4

cyberspace, criminals can live in one country, carry
out crimes in another, leave evidence in a third while
the victim is living in a fourth. Tracking, arresting
and prosecuting cybercriminals require international
information sharing and cross-border operational
cooperation, which are not always aligned with
existing legislative and operational frameworks.
These processes also require speed. Criminals
operate around the clock and constantly improve
their capabilities, while the sharing of information
across borders through mutual legal assistance
treaties tends to be painfully slow.

Cybercrimes are not considered violent crimes;20
they have a significant but almost non-measurable
national impact (mostly due to under-reporting). This
often leads to under-prioritizing law enforcement
efforts against cybercrime, the absence of clear
national cybercrime strategies and a shortage
of resources invested for law enforcement. The
lack of resources is particularly problematic when
addressing cybercrime, which requires specific
tools as well as personnel with technical skills and
expertise who tend to be expensive and in high
demand on the labour market.21

In response to these challenges, the international
community has also started taking action to
enhance national law enforcement capabilities and
facilitate international cooperation on cybercrime;
INTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime Programme and
Innovation Centre in Singapore, Europol’s European
Cybercrime Centre and the Joint Cybercrime Action
Taskforce hosted by the latter Centre are leading
results of these efforts, as are existing international
policy dialogues, such as the United Nations
open-ended intergovernmental expert group on
cybercrime and the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime
Convention Committee representing the State
Parties to the Budapest Convention.

Moreover, the borderless nature of cybercrime
significantly challenges the structured premise of
criminal enforcement based on specific geography.
In the physical world, a crime occurs in a location
with the criminals physically present while, in

However, to date, conventional governmental
criminal justice efforts are proving too limited to
meet the challenge. Research in the United States,
for example, showed the likelihood that less than
1% of cybercrime will result in arrest.22

International and multilateral processes on cybercrime
As cybercrime rose with the introduction of digital
technologies, it also steadily became part of
discussions and processes in several international,
multilateral and multistakeholder fora. The first
multilateral negotiations that aimed to keep criminal
law abreast of technological developments were
launched in 1996 by the Council of Europe,
resulting in the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime
(known as the Budapest Convention). To date
it remains the only legally binding international
treaty that sets common legislative, substantive
and procedural standards for cybercrime
investigations and offers an international criminal
justice cooperation mechanism in this field. The UN
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime
is another legally binding treaty with a broader,
non-cybercrime-specific scope, that at times could
be used to help cooperation in cybercrime cases.
The international landscape also comprises several
fora dedicated to cybercrime discussions, most
notably the Cybercrime Convention Committee
and the UN open-ended intergovernmental
expert group established in 2011 to conduct
a comprehensive study of the problem of

cybercrime. In late 2019, notwithstanding the
global scope of the Budapest Convention, the UN
General Assembly decided to establish an openended ad hoc intergovernmental committee of
experts to elaborate a comprehensive international
convention on countering the use of information
and communications technologies for criminal
purposes, which is expected to engage UN
Member States in several years of negotiations.
On more operational international frameworks, the
Cybercrime Convention Committee’s 24/7 Points
of Contact Network, along with the G7 Roma-Lyon
Group’s High-Tech Crime Subgroup, and its 24/7
Cybercrime Network are key entities that support
international cooperation in cybercrime cases
and complement INTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime
Programme, which builds on the connections
among its National Central Bureaus, its I-24/7
global police communications system, and its
Cyber Analytical platform, together with its recently
launched Cybercrime Knowledge and Operation
Exchanges. Recognizing the dire need to support
the ability of national criminal justice authorities to
deal with cybercrime, capacity building has long

Partnership against Cybercrime

been a consensus priority area of the international
community, with prominent examples of global
initiatives led by the UN Office on Drugs and
Crime’s Global Programme on Cybercrime, the

Council of Europe Cybercrime Programme Office,
and INTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime Programme
and Global Complex for Innovation, further to
important bilateral and regional efforts.

1.4 The way forward
This threat is global – which implies that the solution
must also be a globally coordinated effort. There
is no single solution to reducing the harm caused
by cybercrime, but it is apparent that current
efforts fall short. As long as the barriers to entry for
cybercrime remain low and the prosecution risk for
conducting cybercrimes is limited, cybercriminals
will continue to threaten societies and diminish trust
in the digital economy.

It is inherently clear that a team is stronger than an
individual. Individually, businesses and government
organizations continue to thwart cybercrime the
best way they can with some notable success.
Cyber resilience and cybersecurity are a shared
responsibility that involves everyone and, as
such, requires an ongoing, holistic, systematic
and coordinated approach. To improve the
global security posture and to increase cyber
resilience, however, the public and private
sectors must work together.

Public-private
cooperation against
cybercrime

2.1 The unique role of private companies
In criminal investigations, law enforcement agencies
together with the judiciary traditionally comprise the
criminal justice process, with third parties outside
this structure only responding to legal demands
or requests for information. In this construct, the
primary goal is prosecuting the perpetrators and
adjudicating the crimes. However, when it comes to
cybercrime, the private sector plays an instrumental
role in the potential success of investigations due to
a combination of factors.

BOX 5

BOX 6

Agency for Network and
Information Security

between CSIRTs and Law
Enforcement: interaction with
the Judiciary”, November

csirts-le-cooperation/
at_download/fullReport
(accessed 29 October 2020).

First, preventing and investigating cyber incidents
requires significant technical skills and capabilities.
Law enforcement agencies have different levels of
capabilities in some areas than the private sector, or
do not have the same resources as certain privatesector organizations.

The role of the ICT industry
Internet service providers have unique visibility
into global internet traffic, while technology and
cybersecurity companies have information about the
users of their products and services. This information
gives the private sector insights that can be used to

identify and analyse malicious activities. Moreover, in
many cases, they themselves or their customers are
victims and they have either direct or indirect access
to systems that are being used by criminals, which
creates opportunities for disruptive actions.

Second, practice has shown that companies
subject to a cyberattack may be disinclined to report
cybercrime incidents to law enforcement, and will
turn instead to the private sector for recovery and
investigation. Understandably, one of industry’s
main objectives in the wake of an attack is business
recovery and continuity, which can be in conflict with
law enforcement’s objective to retrieve evidence that
can support its investigation. Moreover, there is often
a lack of confidence in law enforcement’s ability to
effectively investigate cybercrime, while at the same
time there is a fear that reporting cybercrimes may
also create liability or reputational risks and even

have financial implications for the company and
subsequent loss of public and customer trust.
Third, as a result, an organization grappling with a
cyberattack is often more likely to share information
regarding the incident with a contracted privatesector entity (especially security companies and
professional services offering relevant services for
recovery, legal compliance and attribution) or a
non-law enforcement government agency, such
as National Computer Security Incident Response
Teams (CSIRTs).

The special role of National Computer Security Incident Response Teams
CSIRTs, particularly those operating at a national
level, play a crucial role in protecting their
constituencies by preventing and containing cyber
incidents, ensuring information exchange and
cross-sectorial effort coordination and, in many
cases, serving as the first line of support for victims.

management and handling processes (e.g. IP
addresses, web domains) can provide valuable
assistance during cybercrime investigations and
for prosecution. To sustain this effort, legal and
operational frameworks for cooperation need to
be developed at the national level, including joint
training, regular meetings and feedback loops.

At the same time, CSIRTs’ technical background
and the data they acquire during incident

Partnership against Cybercrime

11

Moreover, due to the transnational nature of
cybercrimes, CSIRTs also play a role in supporting
international cooperation and leveraging the
strong CSIRTs international networks, founded
on trust and well-aligned objectives. International

organizations and fora, such as INTERPOL, the
European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)
and the Forum of Incident Response and Security
Teams (FIRST), are already working to enhance
and expand these processes at the global level.

While swift and effective action to a cyber incident
may be aimed at limiting the damage and expediting
the recovery of the organization, that focus does not
preclude working effectively with law enforcement
agencies to increase the latter’s chances of

identifying and apprehending the perpetrators, which
leads to a more substantial and lasting impact.
Harnessing the private sector to work side by side
with law enforcement officials is therefore critical to
successfully combatting cybercriminals.

2.2 Bridging the gap
Private-sector efforts to address cyber risk in general,
and cybercrimes in particular, are mostly focused on
raising the resilience of their products, services and
networks – both through preventive and reactive
measures. Companies’ efforts to deal with concrete
attacks most often entail actions to accelerate

BOX 7

recovery and ensure business continuity, as well
as eventually to prevent future malicious activities.
Using the World Economic Forum framework for
global cybersecurity efforts,23 this process could be
illustrated as a continuous cycle, largely driven by
market forces (Figure 1).

A framework for global cybersecurity efforts
Addressing the three fundamental and unchanged
elements of any cyberthreat – cyberattackers,
cyberattack and cyber weakness – the framework
refers to three overarching, global cybersecurity
strategic goals:
1. Reducing the cyberattack surface: Efforts
aim to raise the overall difficulty of conducting
cyberattacks by reducing points of weakness
across systems and networks that could be
exploited by malicious actors. In the context of
cybercrime, this is mostly about increasing the
security and resilience of potential victims.

Law enforcement’s mission, somewhat separated
from that, is to investigate the criminal act with the
aim of identifying, apprehending and prosecuting
the perpetrators. In some instances, however,
prosecution may not be possible, but that does not

2. Containing cyberattacks: Efforts aim to
disrupt the spread of cyberattacks and reduce
their impact, usually through incident response
and mitigation. In the context of cybercrime,
the cyberattacks are the materialization of the
crime.
3. Restraining cyberattackers: Efforts directly
address the sources of the threat – individuals,
organizations and states or, in general terms,
the offenders.

mean that law enforcement has no role. It must still
be engaged to investigate, identify and assist victims,
and determine if the seizure of a cybercriminal’s
money or infrastructure is possible.

It is necessary to bridge these two processes in a way that will leverage private-sector-led efforts
and capabilities with enforcement efforts, in particular in leveraging private-sector investigations for
enforcement activities and enhancing security efforts based on law enforcement insights.

2.3 Mutual benefit
While the benefits of public-private cooperation for
law enforcement organizations are obvious, private
organizations may hesitate to engage without
understanding the positive outcomes of the process.
First and foremost, sophisticated customers expect
private companies, particularly technology and
financial companies, to be part of the fight against
crime. By participating in collaborative activities,
companies can position themselves as leaders in the
field and active forces for good.

As part of the collaborative process, private-sector
companies will gain access to information from
both law enforcement and other companies, thus
increasing their understanding of the threat. This
additional knowledge can allow the development
of additional technical controls both internally or
through products, allowing the company to protect
its customers and understand the threats important
to them.

Exchanging ideas and data between private-sector
experts can also lead to new findings that drive
product innovation, open new avenues for threat
research and build communication avenues that can
be used in the future to address issues outside of the

collaborative framework. In short, taking advantage
of collective investigation and research can potentially
improve customer sentiment, drive innovation and
build partnerships for future work.

2.4 The roadblocks: Challenges for public-private
cooperation
The value of public-private partnerships is
indisputable, yet connecting disparate organizations
with different missions and goals can be
difficult. Beyond the operational and cultural
challenges associated with cooperation, certain
policy considerations are major roadblocks to
cooperation, on both sides:
–

For companies
Conflict of information sharing with data
protection and privacy laws: Two-way
information sharing is a key component of
any public-private cooperation. While sharing
non-personal data is sufficient in many cases,
operations against malicious actors require
additional details, such as IP addresses, that
stakeholders may be restricted from sharing
due to privacy laws and regulations (such as the
European General Data Protection Regulation
and the US Electronic Communications
Privacy Act). The challenge may increase at the
international level depending on the countries
where the companies are based and their
obligation to comply with national privacyrelated legislation that may limit their ability to
cooperate internationally.
An unclear and diverse regulatory
environment: In many cases, regulatory
guidelines and rules are ambiguous and do not
provide a supportive environment for cooperation.
Companies need to take the initiative and
accept certain risks associated with deciding
which information, if any, and access to give to
law enforcement personnel. While attempting
to work against a shared threat, companies
may unintentionally violate regulations, for
example antitrust laws, or create liability risks for
themselves. This situation hinders companies’
willingness to cooperate.
Agency problems and commercial
sensitivities: Voluntary cooperation with law
enforcement agencies may put companies
at reputational and commercial risk, if they
are perceived as acting at the behest of
governments or jeopardizing privacy. In some

cases, commercial interests and joint operation
needs may conflict.
–

For law enforcement agencies
Restrictions on working with private
companies: By law, most governments cannot
treat companies with similar competencies
and services differently, as dissimilar treatment
could be perceived as offering a competitive
advantage, for example by providing access to
privileged information. Therefore, if collaboration
with the private sector is not specifically
mentioned in their statutes, law enforcement
agencies could argue that they cannot pursue
efforts to cooperate.
Evidence admissibility and availability:
Companies are willing to assist law enforcement
agencies by sharing intelligence relevant to
an investigation, but this information is not
always immediately admissible as evidence.
The challenge arises when the law enforcement
agency requests to receive information
according to evidentiary standards (i.e. when
requesting evidence from the company), which
in some cases causes companies’ unwillingness
to share information. Moreover, regarding crossjurisdiction requests for electronic evidence
from private service providers based in another
country, the current international mechanism of
mutual legal assistance is time-consuming and
slower than the swift action needed to avoid the
loss or change of electronic evidence.
Sensitive information handling: Law
enforcement information relevant to a
cybercrime investigation is often highly
classified and cannot be shared in a normal
manner (using email, etc.), posing challenges
to law enforcement agencies’ ability to
share information with companies. Sharing
this information is necessary for meaningful
collaboration on investigations but adequate
security measures/controls and appropriate
information-handling models must be in place to
allow the sharing of information in a timely and
effective manner.

2.5 Driving cooperation
Despite these challenges, many examples
of successful cooperation between private
companies and law enforcement agencies
exist, including collaboration initiated by a law
enforcement agency, a company or a group of
companies. INTERPOL and Europol are both

BOX 8

working to facilitate multinational and public-private
cooperation. Leading law enforcement agencies
are attempting to engage in enduring discussions
with private companies. Several NGOs are working
to foster multistakeholder relationships to support
cooperation.

Existing mechanisms for cooperation
–

Cyber Defence Alliance (CDA): A partnership
between like-minded financial institutions to
jointly tackle the common threat of cybercrime
by pooling resources, undertaking shared
projects and sharing intelligence in a trusted
environment, to improve the cyber resilience of
all members

–

Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA): A non-profit
organization that facilities both automated
and person-to-person cyberthreat intelligence
sharing among private-sector cybersecurity
providers, and that builds partnerships with
government agencies to combat cyberthreats

–

Europol: A law enforcement agency that
established the European Cybercrime
Centre (EC3) in 2013 to strengthen the
law enforcement response to cybercrime
in the EU and thus help protect European
citizens, businesses and governments
from cybercrimes. The EC3 hosts the Joint
Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), driving
EU and non-EU law enforcement agency
intelligence-led coordinated action against key

Frameworks and mechanisms to support,
strengthen and increase cooperation in
a systematic and ongoing manner need
to be built. Creating new organizations or
replicating existing efforts is not required;
instead, overarching processes, concepts and
partnerships that can complement and amplify
existing efforts should be introduced.

cybercrime threats and targets, and established
advisory groups on financial services, internet
security and communication providers to foster
trust and facilitate results-driven cooperation
with private stakeholders
–

INTERPOL: An international organization that
plays a unique role in facilitating police-topolice cooperation in the field of cyber through
its Global Cybercrime Programme, providing
neutral platforms for collaboration and
information sharing. The Global Cybercrime
Programme focuses on developing cybercrime
threat responses and coordinating cybercrime
operations and law enforcement cyber
capability development; INTERPOL’s Project
Gateway provides one such platform for publicprivate information sharing on cybercrime

–

US National Cyber-Forensics and Training
Alliance (NCFTA): A US-based non-profit
organization founded in 2002 to facilitate
information sharing between law enforcement
agencies, industry and academia, and identify,
mitigate and disrupt cybercrime threats

These structures are needed not only to help
overcome barriers to cooperation, but also to
improve the effectiveness of the collaboration
and ensure its sustainability. Also crucial is to
build structures that allow the creation of truly
international efforts to address the global challenge.

Promoting principles
for public-private
cooperation to
combat cybercrime

3.1 The rationale
Since the publication of the World Economic
Forum’s Recommendations for Public-Private
Partnership against Cybercrime in 2016, which
outlines ways to encourage dialogues and
cooperation to fight cybercrime, the Partnership
against Cybercrime initiative has identified six

Principle 1

principles for public-private cooperation against
cybercrime. These principles provide a framework
for action-driven cooperation that can ensure
success and sustainability in collaborative activities
while overcoming key challenges.

Embracing a shared narrative for collective action against cybercrime
The cooperation should be based on a multistakeholder approach, in which different stakeholders, while
recognizing their different motivations, have joint ownership of a shared narrative and objective for the
greater good of reducing cybercrime across all industries and globally.

Principle 2

Cooperating on the basis of long-term strategic alignment
Stakeholders need to commit to a long-term dialogue and to finding common ground for cooperation,
based on an improved understanding of their respective needs, goals and values. The collaboration should
include identifying strategic barriers to the cooperation and ways to overcome them; understanding and
deconflicting respective priorities; recognizing new opportunities for cooperation and partnerships; and
developing new approaches and common knowledge in support of collaborative efforts.

Principle 3

Undertaking trust-building behaviours
Successful cooperation requires a certain level of trust that allows participants to feel comfortable in the
cooperation. This trust can be achieved by building and maintaining an atmosphere of transparency,
equity and fairness in all interactions. Joint decision-making and voluntary sharing are important elements
in building this conducive atmosphere. Interacting regularly and discussing trust-hindering actions are also
needed to build trust over time.

Principle 4

Systematizing the cooperation
Cooperation should be built on institutional relationships rather than on personal relations, leveraging the
respective advantages each sector brings and emphasizing common interests. This is needed both to develop
sustainable cooperation that is not at risk when people change directions, and to improve cooperation when
trust and personal rapport are limited. When collaborating on concrete actions, it is important to facilitate
improvements by analysing successes and failures based on clearly defined objectives and expectations.
Partnership against Cybercrime

16

Principle 5

Ensuring value for participating in the cooperation
Capturing both the cooperation’s concrete value as well as any other opportunities it creates is essential to
ensure continued commitment and increasing investments by all stakeholders. The mutual recognition of
efforts is the easiest way to achieve this when successes can be communicated publicly. Moreover, twoway feedback during and following the collaboration can also optimize value creation for both sides, while
the cooperation should be supported and endorsed by their leadership to ensure that the value creation is
aligned with the public and the private sectors’ strategic interests.

Principle 6

Respecting concerns and challenges
All the stakeholders should acknowledge and address each other’s privacy, legal and other governance
and geopolitical limitations and concerns from the outset in order to pre-empt any roadblocks to the
cooperation.

BOX 9

A multilevel framework
These principles are aimed at global cooperation,
but they can be applied to facilitate cooperation
on a regional, national or local level. Law
enforcement agencies can engage with local
stakeholders to improve both security and
enforcement efforts. Even global corporations’

national or regional operations can gain
much from the cooperation at the local level.
Implementing those principles normally
requires some adjustment to local needs and
circumstances, based on a continuous dialogue
between the stakeholders.

Taking collaborative
action to disrupt
cybercrime
ecosystems

4.1 Taking action against cybercrime
Traditional efforts to deter criminals have focused
on raising the risks to the individual criminal
actor through attribution and prosecution by law
enforcement agencies and the judiciary. This
approach is of course the ultimate way to stop crime.
In the case of cybercrime, however, it is extremely
difficult to achieve this goal by these means alone,
and the chances of inefficiency and failure are high.
Even the exceptional efforts of international law
enforcement agencies in recent years to investigate
cybercrimes and prosecute cybercriminals, and their
many successes, have proven insufficient to lower
the rate of cybercrime. Most often, the operations
involved in investigations and prosecutions against
cybercrime do not combine public-sector efforts and
private-sector capabilities. The investigations have
also shown that cybercrime does not resemble crime
perpetrated in the physical world and thus cannot
be combated using traditional methods. Instead, a
paradigm shift in the way the law enforcement and
private-sector communities collaborate to address
this crime is required.
As mentioned, a promising way to deter
cybercriminals is to raise the cost of engaging in
criminal activities. One indirect way to raise these
costs is to improve potential victims’ cybersecurity.
But, although this tactic is crucial, its results are
limited because criminals often find the weakest
links in the cybersecurity chain.
A more direct approach, with the potential for
large-scale impact, is to disrupt cybercriminal
ecosystems that contain infrastructures and assets.
This approach can include taking steps to restrict
revenue streams and prohibit the promotion of
illegal sites and the hosting of criminal content.
These restrictions can be applied, for example,
by seizing the merchant account used to accept
payment for the fraudulent activity or the domain
that the illegal content is hosted on.
Disruption focuses on massively disabling malicious
technical infrastructure. Criminals who engage in
cybercrime, such as business email compromise,

intellectual property theft or tech support fraud,
need to lose their investments as quickly as they
make them. Quickly eliminating criminal investments
can inhibit their ability to execute the crime, which
is especially needed when criminal activities pose
an immediate danger to victims and society. In
some cases, it may also allow returning some of the
losses to the victims.
Private-sector companies and their stakeholders
are frequently the victims of cybercriminal conduct,
but they are also in a good position to lead
disruption efforts. Not only do private companies
have superior access to technical information
and the capacity to identify, track and analyse
cybercriminal activities, in many cases they have
more direct or indirect opportunity to dismantle the
cyber infrastructures and assets criminals use.
To date, cybercrime enforcement has been a
patchwork of government and private-sector efforts
to stay one step ahead of sophisticated criminals.
While law enforcement agencies are used to
focusing mostly on the more traditional attribution,
asset seizure, arrest and prosecution approach,
some private companies have taken the lead on
more immediate preventive and disruptive measures,
either unilaterally or through civil court action.
Effective action against cybercrime can be achieved
through well-coordinated collaboration between
relevant public and private actors, leveraging their
expertise and advantages, exploring all possible
courses of action and prioritizing joint action
against the top threats. Private companies need
to recognize that they have a significant role to
play in not only identifying criminal trends and
activities, but also in actively countering them, while
law enforcement agencies need to acknowledge
the unique role private companies can play and
embrace cooperation as a key option. By working
together against cybercriminals, they can dismantle
malicious infrastructure, gather and preserve
evidence for arrest and prosecution, and rescue
and restitute lost assets.

Partnership against Cybercrime

BOX 10

Disruption is here and now!
Certain disruption operations have already proven
successful. For example, in 2014, a global
effort disabled the “GameOver Zeus” botnet
and rescued over 1 million infected computers
from criminal control. Similarly, through a publicprivate partnership in 2016, criminal control of
the “Avalanche” network was severed and over
2 million infected computers were liberated.

These two examples show that the disruption of
a cybercriminal ecosystem substantially increases
the threat actors’ cost of conducting their activities,
and protects the public. But such actions are too
infrequent and have taken too long. To effectively
combat cybercrime, disruptive operations must
be rapid and coordinated, applying a systematic
approach and measuring their lasting impact.

4.2 Prioritizing disruption
To determine if disruption is the appropriate and
optimal action, the threat should be evaluated
to determine whether disabling the technical
infrastructure will mitigate or eliminate the threat.
But the determination is not either/or. In operations
coordinated by public- and private-sector actors,
a combination of traditional and disruptive
approaches may work best. Working with the
disruptive model along with traditional techniques
will increase the costs for cybercriminals and their
risk of arrest. But this combination requires the
parties involved to be pragmatic, and carefully and
flexibly synchronizing the action to be taken.

Once it is assembled and its goals are set, the team
will need to sufficiently comprehend the criminal
scheme and its infrastructure to be effective.
To design an effective disruption operation, the
decision-makers should be aware that the criminal
investigation will not be the same as a traditional one.
Traditional investigations are often narrowly restricted
to attribution of responsibility and location of the
underlying criminal actor. The underlying criminal
infrastructure, however, is not necessarily tied solely
to a single criminal actor or enterprise. Therefore,
consideration should be given to the operation’s
appropriate scope, to achieve the biggest impact.

Managing and coordinating joint action raises
certain challenges and risks. To ensure successful
operational cooperation, especially when the aim is
disruptive action, decision-makers should take into
account three key considerations:
Operational objectives
At the operation’s outset, who should participate
must be considered first, including certain
participants but possibly excluding others. Several
factors will make a difference in the decision:
for example, where the criminal actor(s) and
infrastructures are located, which law enforcement
agencies are already investigating, what privatesector companies (that are tracking the threat or
whose services are being used by the criminal)
have a stake in the case, and where the victims are
located. Taking into account geopolitical factors that
may influence the viability and eventual success of
the operation is also important.

Legal and policy factors
To effectively disrupt criminal infrastructure, the
jurisdiction(s) where the infrastructure is located
should be identified. The legal authority for a publicor private-sector entity to act in that jurisdiction then
needs to be clearly established. In some cases, a
public- or private-sector partner will inherently possess
the authority needed to act, although all actions
should be performed in compliance with human rights
considerations and due process safeguards. In other
cases, public- or private-sector actors will need to use
the authority of the courts. In cases where a criminal’s
infrastructure is located in a jurisdiction that does not
allow coordinated action, the team may be able to
identify another jurisdiction that could provide the legal
authority to execute the disruption in a different way.
For example, if directly confiscating the infrastructure
is not possible, seizing websites could be an effective
alternative when the domain registrar is located within
the legal authority jurisdiction.

After participants are identified, they should
determine the disruptive operation’s goal. The
participants in this type of operation will play different
roles and may have different goals and measures
of success. Timely disruptions are important to
protect victims, and proper coordination can help
to preserve all or most of the evidence needed
for prosecution. The diverse objectives can be
reconciled, but the stakeholders must identify and
share their goals. They should recognize that their
individual goals may not be fully achievable but
should be willing to negotiate their role to support
the disruption of the criminal’s infrastructure.

In addition to identifying the appropriate legal
authority, it is important to consider whether the
disruption could interfere with recognized rights to
privacy or privacy regulations. During the operation,
all information sharing should occur in accordance
with applicable national privacy laws and
agreements. All information should be secure, have
limited access and include documented procedures
for sharing. Therefore, relying upon existing sharing
centres and protocols may make sharing more
efficient. Transparency regarding the operation, the
legal authorities involved and the results is essential,
but naming all participants may not be practical or

appropriate. Disruption operations should be lawful
and legitimate acts designed to disable a criminal’s
infrastructure in order to protect the public.
Unintended consequences
Military wisdom suggests that “no battle plan
survives first contact with the enemy”. Therefore,
any disruptive action must take into account the
potential for unintended consequences. Negative
consequences can result from dismantling a
criminal’s infrastructure, affecting those not involved
in the criminal activity. For example, legitimate
consumers or businesses may unknowingly – often
through compromise – use part of the criminal’s
infrastructure. Other government entities with
legitimate investigations related to national security
or criminal activity could be at work. In almost all
operations, unwitting victims who are using an

infected device will need remediation. The team will
also have to consider their legal liability, as those
involved in the disruption could be held responsible
for any damages. Careful consideration of possible
unintended consequences to legitimate disruption
activities will help to minimize the possible damage,
allow for proper notice and anticipate remediation.
The disruption will likely become public and, for the
identified team members, the publicity can result
in retaliation by the criminals. In some instances,
a disruption could be viewed as a crime or hostile
act. Importantly, public- and private-sector actors
must vigilantly monitor their systems to minimize
any technical or financial harm and communicate
appropriately with the public at large about what
has happened, while allowing stakeholders to
control their level of exposure.

“How do you defeat a botnet? (It takes a village)
“From December 2015 to October 2018, a
cybercriminal ring used malware known as
‘Kovter’ to infect and access more than 1.7 million
computers worldwide and used hidden browsers on
those computers to download fake web pages. Ads
were then loaded onto those pages to falsify billions
of ad views, resulting in businesses paying over $29
million for ads they believed were viewed by actual
human users. The botnet was part of a sophisticated
infrastructure of command-and-control servers
that also monitored whether individually infected
computers had been detected by cybersecurity
companies as involved in fraud. The botnet was
controlled by three Russian nationals located abroad.

“Following the arrest of one of the suspects, the FBI
worked with private-sector companies to reroute
or ‘sinkhole’ traffic to prevent further victimization,
executed seizure warrants to take control of 23
internet domains used by the criminals, and worked
with server-hosting companies in six countries
to preserve and then take down 89 servers used
to operate the scheme … working closely with
foreign partners – specifically, Malaysian, Bulgarian,
Estonian, German, French, Dutch, British, and
Swiss authorities and Europol – to assist with
aspects of the investigation and with apprehending
three indicted subjects for arrest and extradition.

“The US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) worked with the nonprofit
National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance
(NCFTA) to bring together multiple private-sector and
nonprofit organizations to dismantle the botnet. The
NCFTA played a key role by providing a collaborative
information-sharing platform that enabled partners to
share cyberthreat indicators, develop an operational
strategy, and coordinate sequenced actions.

“Within hours, a criminal cyber infrastructure that
had been generating millions of fraudulent electronic
bid requests per minute went completely dark.
Eight defendants were indicted for their role in
orchestrating the botnet and another fraudulent
digital advertising scheme, and to date several have
appeared and entered guilty pleas in U.S. courts.”

4.3 Moving forward
Decision-makers should consider these three factors
when assessing whether and how to participate in
a disruption operation. Careful assessment of these
issues and others that may arise in a particular set of
circumstances will maximize the likelihood that the
disruption will be successful while minimizing any
unnecessary risks. Although the decision to participate
in a disruption operation should not be made lightly,
organizations should not be paralysed by inaction.
Applying the necessary amount of effort and taking the
risks involved are justified because sufficiently large and
timely disruption operations will make it more costly

and difficult for criminals to rebuild their infrastructure,
whether it pertain to their finances, personnel or
technology. In addition, the information gained from
operations will allow victim identification and remediation
and can protect the public from future harm.
To fully enjoy the benefits of collaborative action
against cybercrime, suitable frameworks must be
put into place to enable sustainable and effective
relations. Specifically, collaboration needs neutral
and supportive spaces for considering these issues
in a joint decision-making process.

Partnering to combat
global cybercrime

5.1 A global architecture for public-private
cooperation against cybercrime
Despite enormous investment from both the
public and private sectors, current global efforts
to limit the growth of cybercrime are fragmented
and insufficient. The systemic containment of
cybercrime will only happen when the scope, scale
and speed of public-private cooperation deepens,
expanding internationally and sustained over the
long term. The response to cybercrime requires an
equally scalable approach. This section presents
an architecture for carrying out actions based on
these principles, by forming a global network of
stakeholders committed to the shared mission.
In facilitating cooperation, the problem is neither
a lack of willingness nor a shortage of operational
platforms. Law enforcement agencies, NGOs

and private companies cooperate eagerly and
frequently. A significant number of collaborative
initiatives already exist, and multiple operational
bodies dot the global cyber landscape. Instead, the
problem is that these efforts remain fragmented,
unconnected and sporadic. No existing architecture
facilitates global, comprehensive and coordinated
efforts against cybercrime, allows participants to act
as equal partners, or takes into consideration both
public and private equities. But building on existing
frameworks and lessons learned to date in the fight
against cybercrime to shape such an architecture
could lead to a systematic transformation in the way
the respective capacities of the public and private
sectors are leveraged, and to turning the tables on
cybercriminals.

5.2 Building a successful architecture
As with many efforts in the information age, a
government-centric, hierarchical approach to
combatting cybercrime will not succeed. Global
public-private cooperation cannot be centrally
managed by one organization. Regardless of other
shortcomings, conflicting priorities among sovereign
nations render such a structure unworkable.
Instead, an effective architecture should take a
different form and have the following characteristics:
A distributed structure: Like the internet itself,
the architecture should be distributed, comprised
of autonomous elements and connected through
many different pathways. A distributed structure is

the only way to achieve the scope, scale and speed
needed to combat cybercrime.
Trust: Trust is essential for successful cooperation.
Trust is built up over time; nothing can replace
personal relationships or the confidence stemming
from historical success. However, the architecture
should include operational processes designed
to enhance confidence and trust when personal
rapport has not yet been built among stakeholders.
For example, establishing business rules and using
technology that provides stakeholders maximum
control over their data and assets enhance their
willingness to share.

Unlocking the potential of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs)
Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are a set
of emerging technologies that can fundamentally
reduce the risks associated with collaboration
and information sharing (particularly in regulated
environments). Techniques, such as federated
analysis, homomorphic encryption and secure
multiparty computation, are allowing to compute
over encrypted data and thus enabling to process
queries on each other’s data without ever learning
what the other party’s data is.
PETs can unlock enormous possibilities of joint
investigations between the public and private

Flexible design: An effective architecture must
cover many different use cases and deal effectively
with regional variations. It must adapt to the varied
public-private relationships and cultures in different
communities. What works in South-East Asia, for
example, will not directly apply to Europe.
Multilevel: Experience shows that small, focused
groups are best at carrying out operational
activities. Further, different targets require different
small-group compositions. Yet, these groups require
legal, technology and organizational infrastructure
to succeed; large, permanent organizations are
much more efficient at providing and maintaining
such infrastructure. Thus, certain architectural
elements need to be temporary, while others should
be permanent. The temporary elements come into
existence for a specific purpose, then expand or
contract as needed over the course of an activity,
and disband. The permanent elements provide the
“infrastructure” needed when a collaboration occurs
in order to avoid inefficiencies or to “reinvent the
wheel”.

sectors, for example by illuminating potential
data and investigative opportunities in different
organizations, while keeping the organization in full
control over its data.
The Cyber Defence Alliance (CDA) is currently testing
the use of a PET-enabled collaborative platform with
financial institutions to improve their ability to identify
fraud in data by interrogating each other’s systems
for suspicious cybercrime activity. If successful,
these trials may improve efficiency across
investigation teams while maintaining appropriate
privacy requirements protecting the data.

Transparent processes: Effective cooperation
requires processes that are transparent and
repeatable. These processes can be technical (e.g.
agreeing to a standard for exchanging information),
business oriented (e.g. establishing standard
procedures for conducting meetings) or operational
(e.g. deciding on the methods used to engage in and
coordinate actions among the members of the team).
Transparent rules: The policies and business rules
governing the collaboration framework should be
transparent and equitable (both in terms of the
expectations and the treatment of participants). They
should also incentivize team members to provide
information, allocate resources and take action.
Equity: The architecture should treat the interests
of all participating organizations equally and should
allow the goals, priorities and outcomes of a
specific cooperative activity to be set collectively; no
single entity or side should dominate the process.
Both public- and private-sector team members
should take on leadership positions, depending on
the circumstances.

5.3 A framework for success
What would an architecture against cybercrime
incorporating these characteristics look like? One
structure suggested by the Partnership against
Cybercrime Working Group envisions a three-level
system:
–

FIGURE 2

A global partnership, building on the existing
Forum initiative, to bring together international
stakeholders to provide an overarching narrative
and commitment to cooperate; foster interaction
within a global network of entities that drive
efforts to fight cybercrime; and facilitate

support cooperation and overcome barriers in
the long term.

organizations that strive to facilitate publicprivate cooperation over time.

5.4 A global partnership: The strategic level
A global partnership is needed to enhance
commitment and harness power towards
successful and rewarding collaboration, while
inspiring renewed trust and confidence among the
stakeholders through strategic alignment.

and stakeholders, enhancing the sustainability,
global reach and effectiveness of the operational
processes. The Permanent Nodes would share
feedback from their collaborative efforts and the
partnership would support continuous learning
and shared problem-solving. It would also
promote improved cybercrime mapping, thereby
identifying new opportunities for cooperation,
and would facilitate the development of shared
priorities, as the different stakeholders will have
different perspectives on the global risks arising
from cybercrime.

The partnership could be formed by building on
the existing World Economic Forum Partnership
against Cybercrime initiative, which brings
together an action-oriented community of leading
stakeholders committed to the shared goal of
acting collaboratively against cybercrime.
The Partnership against Cybercrime would provide
the needed strategic processes and would promote
three key objectives:
–

To foster a shared narrative to increase
commitment and affiliation
Leaders in the public and private sectors need
to recognize their responsibility and ability
to restrain cybercrime through collaborative
action. Private companies should commit and
contribute their capabilities to supporting the
greater good. Similarly, public agencies should
recognize the unique role private companies
can play and provide space for their leadership
in collaborative efforts. This narrative would
also highlight the need for new approaches
to combating cybercrime and the reasons
traditional models, even though necessary in
general, will not work in this context. Over time,
embracing this shared narrative would allow
stakeholders to increase their commitment and
willingness to cooperate as well as build trust
and affiliation between them.

To improve stakeholders’ understanding of
respective interests, needs, goals, priorities
and constraints
Members of the partnership would engage
in an ongoing dialogue to better understand
their different perspectives and to shed light on
various elements that could potentially boost
or hinder successful cooperation. A key effort
would be to explore ways to overcome the
barriers to cooperation, including working with
relevant policy-makers to better address policies
or laws hindering effective collaboration against
cybercrime.

This global partnership’s members would include
the Permanent Nodes, which would host the
cooperative efforts; relevant national authorities;
leading cyber-related service and platform
providers; large, cyber-mature private corporations;
and highly targeted end users. The members
would assert their willingness to participate in
cooperation efforts and to support the strategic
goals by endorsing the principles for public-private
cooperation and the partnership’s objectives.

To amplify operational cooperation
The partnership would facilitate insight sharing
and learning between the Permanent Nodes

After 2-3 years, the members of this partnership
would consider transforming it into an independent
entity, an Alliance to Combat Global Cybercrime.

5.5 Permanent Nodes: The coordination level
The Permanent Nodes provide connectivity
between the conceptual narrative developed at
the strategic level and the actions taken by the
Threat Focus Cells. In particular, the Permanent
Nodes provide the capabilities needed to increase
and sustain the Threat Focus Cells’ cooperative
activities over time and to keep them aligned with
the strategic goals. Neutral organizations, the
Permanent Nodes would work with both public
and private stakeholders equally, and would take
a leading role in initiating cooperative efforts and
in incentivizing participants to provide information,
allocate resources and take actions.
Typical Permanent Nodes would be NGOs and
non-profit organizations that are already spurring
cooperation between private companies and law
enforcement agencies, such as the US National
Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA),
the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), the Cyber
Defence Alliance (CDA) and the Financial Services
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FSISAC). INTERPOL and Europol, which are also
leading international collaborations that include
private companies, would also serve as important
Permanent Nodes, allowing a much broader
connection with law enforcement agencies around
the world.
The Permanent Nodes’ key contributions would
include:
Infrastructure: The Permanent Nodes would
provide the underlying infrastructure needed to
make the Threat Focus Cells effective, such as
communications capability, legal agreements,
reporting mechanisms, office space, etc. Each
activity would not require new infrastructure
and multiple Threat Focus Cells could use the
infrastructure at the same time.

Operational rules: The Permanent Nodes would
establish, maintain and help enforce the Threat
Focus Cells’ technical and non-technical operational
rules, such as regulating the handling of shared
information. These rules would require official,
legal arrangements, and should be transparent
and equitable. Each Permanent Node may have a
different set of rules, depending on the nature of its
mission and the stakeholders involved.
Operational efficiency: The Permanent Nodes
would collaborate together to reduce the Threat
Focus Cells’ potential overlaps or inefficiencies. They
would help each other identify trusted stakeholders
to fill expertise and capability gaps, and develop and
implement the means to federate trust so the member
of one Permanent Node may seamlessly participate in
another Permanent Node’s Threat Focus Cell.
Strategic dialogue: The Permanent Nodes would
enable the dialogue between stakeholders to ensure
a deeper understanding of the goals and priorities
for concrete operational opportunities. They would
also facilitate joint decisions on the goals of the
Threat Focus Cells. The Permanent Nodes might
also ease joint decision-making processes, taking
into account operational objectives, legal and policy
factors, and unintended consequences, as well as
other stakeholders’ concerns, such as their risk
appetite, costs and reputational implications.
In this model, each Permanent Node would eventually
sponsor and support many Threat Focus Cells
comprised of diverse participants in varying stages
of action. Choosing which Permanent Node would
sponsor a particular Threat Focus Cell would depend
on a variety of factors, including the Cell’s level of
participant representation within a Permanent Node’s
existing membership or the threat’s disproportionate
impact on a Permanent Node’s home region.

5.6 Threat Focus Cells: The operational level
Under this architecture, the main operational unit
would be the Threat Focus Cells. These cells
would be temporary trust groups consisting of
both public- and private-sector organizations and
they would focus on discreet cybercrime targets
or issues. Each cell would be sponsored and
supported by the Permanent Node best suited for
the task. The Threat Focus Cells should be able to
deliver operational outcomes faster than traditional
law enforcement approaches — potentially in as
little as 90 to 180 days. Each cell would be in
“sprint” mode, reminiscent of the agile software
development approach, and it would disband upon
completion. While cell structures and processes
must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate

the varying needs of different collaborations,
consistency in a few key elements would support
efficiency and interoperability:
Leadership: Ideally, each Threat Focus Cell would
be led jointly by a private-sector participant, a
law enforcement participant and a designated
representative of the sponsoring Permanent
Node. The first two co-leads should be subject
matter experts and serve as the collaboration’s
driving force. The third co-chair would oversee
the collaboration’s administrative and supporting
functions, such as systems access, logistics and
reports, and would contribute on the substance.

Partnership against Cybercrime

25

Composition: Effective operations require the
participation of the right organizations, or they will not
achieve the desired scope and scale. At the same
time, too many participants can render the activity
unwieldy or erode trust. Therefore, Threat Focus
Cells would typically include between 10 and 15
individual participants, based on their organizations’
willingness, resources and capabilities to contribute
to the collaborative efforts. Private-sector participants
would typically represent organizations that can
act to enhance cybersecurity on behalf of large
constituencies, that have unique access to relevant
cybersecurity information and threat intelligence, or
that can contribute on an ecosystem-wide basis.
Specialists not affiliated with these organizations
but possessing needed subject matter expertise
could also be invited. Law enforcement members
would typically represent national-level agencies with
pending investigations into the cybercrime issues
being considered. Other government participants
could come from network defence or sector-specific
agencies, depending on the target and the nature of
the contemplated operations.
Goals: All participants would need to agree on
the Threat Focus Cell’s desired outcomes. The
goals, priorities and outcomes for a cell should
not be driven by any single entity. In many cases,
the goal would be a culminating operation, which
could include an infrastructure takedown, public

advisories and arrests. However, a Threat Focus
Cell’s aim could also be to scout a new threat.
Identifying and arresting cybercriminals can be
part of a lengthy process and are subject to
considerations outside a cell’s control. Thus, a longterm prosecution goal should not prevent the cell
from taking other actions to protect customers and
the public. However, each cell would strive to help
law enforcement agencies obtain the information
and technical assistance needed to prosecute
those responsible for criminal activity.
Collaboration methods: Initial or periodic in-person
meetings might be required to build trust, share
sensitive information, establish roles, and set goals
and timetables. The Threat Focus Cells would likely
need to operate using remote communication. The
sponsoring Permanent Node would provide the
infrastructure and facilities to support this virtual work.
Operational rules: Although the Threat Focus
Cells’ rules would vary, a few would be common to
all cells to promote efficiency and interoperability.
The providing organization should clearly indicate
handling requirements on shared information, for
example, and the participants would agree to abide
by those requirements. Additionally, participants
should agree not to take unilateral action prior to the
cell’s culminating operation and to immediately raise
any concerns to the Threat Focus Cell’s leadership.

5.7 Defining success
Measuring success in cybersecurity has always
been challenging. In fact, the lack of effective,
widely accepted performance metrics has hindered
the field’s development since its inception.
Nevertheless, tracking progress is necessary to
correct or adjust courses of action and report on
successes (or shortcomings). In addition, what
constitutes success varies over time: activities that
are beneficial or necessary in the short term may
be insufficient in the long run. Therefore, identifying
metrics on which to focus over the short, medium
and long terms is recommended.
In the short term (1 year), success would be
measured by the ability to convene the community
for action and create the conditions for cooperation.
This step will lay the foundation for taking action.
To succeed in this effort, it is necessary to gather
stakeholders in constructive and iterative dialogues
and interactions, bridging the public-private,
operational-policy and geopolitical gaps. One
simple way to gauge success is by the number of
stakeholders embracing the shared narrative and
the principles for public-private cooperation.
In the medium term (2-3 years), success would
be measured by the number of concrete and
successful collaborative actions taken by the
Permanent Nodes against cybercrime. This metric

should reflect the specific threats tackled – in
joint actions or actions supported by different
stakeholders. In addition, it would be necessary to
advocate for the policy processes that are needed
to ensure successful and sustainable cooperation.
Success does not necessarily mean a reduction
of policy barriers, but the promotion of relevant
solutions.
In the long term, the goal is to reduce cybercrime to
an economically sustainable level. But determining
whether the initiative has achieved this level of
impact will not be easy. Simple percentages are
impossible to calculate since the total amount of
cybercrime in the world is not only unknown but
is unquantifiable. As a result, gauging success will
require proxy indicators. Some indicators that would
point towards a decrease in overall cybercrime
include a decreasing number of reported incidents;
lower estimates for the economic impact of
cybercrime; an increasing number and frequency of
disruptive actions, including arrests and prosecution
of cybercriminals; and a decreasing price for
criminal services (due to decreased demand) and
an increasing price for others (due to increased
risk). One of the key tasks in its first few years
would be to identify the most relevant, measurable
and verifiable proxy indicators and determine how
to track them over time.
Partnership against Cybercrime

Conclusion
Next step: implementation
The risk from cybercrime continues to grow,
affecting everyone; current solutions are simply
not sufficient. As long as the entry barriers to
cybercrime are critically low, people will continue to
suffer from its impact. Collaborative work is needed
to make it harder for attacks to succeed and to
make the penalties much stronger so the costs to
the criminals outweigh the gains.

In the coming months, the Partnership against
Cybercrime Working Group will continue to
prepare the implementation of these concepts and
widen the scope of the initiative’s efforts. Leading
companies and law enforcement agencies are
invited to pledge their continued commitment and
support to the effort to facilitate cooperation in the
fight against cybercrime.

Businesses, governments, NGOs and international
organizations must face the challenges associated
with cooperating against cybercrime head-on.
This report aims to help stakeholders overcome
the challenges and foster the operational and
conceptual processes needed. Making them a reality
would be a significant step forward in this fight.

The suggested architecture could eventually evolve
into a newly envisioned, independent Alliance to
Combat Global Cybercrime. In the interim, the
World Economic Forum and key stakeholders will
work together to promote the desired processes
and assess the validity of the concept.
The need to combat cybercrime is pressing and the
time to act is now.
