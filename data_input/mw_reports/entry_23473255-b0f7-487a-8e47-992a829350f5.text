TOP 10 VULNERABILITIES OF CONTROL SYSTEMS
AND THEIR ASSOCIATED MITIGATIONS – 2007
North American Electric Reliability Council

National SCADA Test Bed Program
December 7, 2006
Preamble
This document provides practices that can help mitigate the potential risks that can occur to
some electricity sector organizations. Each organization decides for itself the risks it can
accept and the practices it deems appropriate to manage those risks.

Introduction
This reference document provides a non-prioritized list of the top 10 most common
vulnerabilities that put control systems in the electricity sector at risk. The list is based on the
combined expertise of the NERC Control System Security Working Group (CSSWG). The
CSSWG updates the list annually based on changes in industry implementation or available
technology. Asset owners are encouraged to use this list to augment their risk management
processes.
The U.S. Department of Energy National SCADA Test Bed (NSTB) program has provided
initial recommended mitigation strategies to the list of vulnerabilities prepared by the CSSWG
members. Three levels of mitigation strategies are proposed – foundational, intermediate,
and advanced. Foundational strategies are considered to be minimal mitigation strategies
typically involving the establishment of security policy and fundamental implementations.
Intermediate strategies are a next step in establishing a secure posture and involve readily
available technologies or the stronger implementation of baseline policies. Advanced
mitigation strategies provide long term achievable security posture guidance but may include
tools or technologies that are currently not readily available.
This year’s list also includes explanatory examples to clarify the intent of the CSSWG for each
vulnerability, and in some cases cautionary notes are also provided where appropriate.
However, in all cases the reader is reminded that technology should always be designed and
tested for the specific control system environment where they are intended to be deployed to
properly consider safety and operational considerations.

Top 10 Vulnerabilities of Control Systems
1. Inadequate policies, procedures, and culture that govern control system security.

A New Jersey Nonprofit Organization

•
•
•
•
•

Clash between operational culture with modern IT security methods.
Lack of overall awareness and appreciation of the risk associated with enabling the
networking of these customized control systems.
Absence of control system information security policy.
Lack of auditing, enforcing, or adhering to control system information security policy
not adhered to, enforced or audited.
Lack of adequate risk assessment

Mitigation Strategies:
Foundational
• Assign a senior manager with overall responsibility for leading and managing the
entity’s implementation of, and adherence to, robust control system security practices.
• Document and implement a cyber security policy that represents management’s
commitment and ability to secure its critical infrastructure assets. Periodically review
and update.
• Develop security procedures and implementation guidance to enable employees to
implement specific elements of the cyber security policy.

activities.
2. Inadequately designed control system networks that lack sufficient defense-in-depth
mechanisms.
•
•

Network security of control system devices were not adequately considered when
originally designed. These systems were designed with availability and reliability in
mind.
Control systems may not be capable of secure operation in an internetworked
environment without significant investment to reengineer the technology so it is in
accordance with appropriate risk assessment criteria.

Mitigation Strategies:
Foundational

security perimeter to ensure authenticity of the accessing party, where feasible (e.g.,
restrict remote access to field devices).
• Include detailed security requirements in all design specifications.
Intermediate
• Implement compartmentalization design concepts to establish electronic security
perimeters and cyber asset separation necessary for a defense-in-depth architecture.

firewall, or physical disconnection when not in use. This secure method should be
established and monitored in accordance with the established security policy and
procedures.
• Follow the NERC security guideline “Securing Remote Access to Electronic Control
and Protection Systems”.

Advanced
• Design access levels into the system that restricts access to configuration tools and
operating screens as applicable. Segregate development platforms from run-time
platforms.
• Use proximity based authentication technology, such as RFID Tokens.
