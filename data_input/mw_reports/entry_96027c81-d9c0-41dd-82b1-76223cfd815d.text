Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers
discovered the Cueisfry first-stage downloader trojan while
analyzing a spearphishing message sent to an email account
belonging to an intelligence-related group in Japan. The message
was part of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign targeting
government officials and economic institutions in Southeast Asia.
Behavior
The attachment contained a Rich Text Format (RTF) file that exploited CVE-2014-1761,
which affects multiple Microsoft Word releases and allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via crafted RTF data. Upon exploitation, the RTF file drops the Epdate.exe file
(MD5: 1c29b24d4d4ef7568f519c470b51bbed) and executes it from the system's %TEMP%
folder (see Figure 1). The compilation timestamp of the dropped Epdate.exe file was April 21,
2014, indicating that it was created the day before the email was sent.

When executed for the first time on a victim's computer, Epdate.exe (the Cueisfry trojan)
checks for the existence of “AntiVir_Update.URL” in the Startup folder. When that check fails,
Cueisfry writes the file to the Startup folder to allow the malware to maintain persistence and
automatically launch with a system restart and across logins. Cueisfry does not communicate
with its command and control (C2) server during this initial run. When the victim logs back
1/3

onto the system, Windows automatically triggers the AntiVir_Update.URL file in the Startup
folder. As with its initial run, Epdate.exe checks for the AntiVir_Update.URL file in the Startup
folder. Confirming the file's existence, Cueisfry establishes a connection to the hard-coded
C2 IP address 198.55.103.148. This IP address is still active as of this publication.
Upon execution, Cueisfry checks for proxy settings on the victim's systems by querying the
HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet Settings registry key and reading
values for ProxyEnable and ProxyServer. Then it writes information about processes running
on the victim's system to %TEMP%~Proc75C.DAT. After gathering the system's process
information, Cueisfry relays it to the C2 server (see Figure 2).

Conclusion
The details of the spearphishing email and dropped Cueisfry malware demonstrate attackers'
sophistication when targeting high-value organizations. The use of CVE-2014-1761 reveals
attackers' ability to exploit a newly disclosed vulnerability. Organizations can protect
themselves from such attacks by applying security updates as they become available from
vendors. Organizations should also invest in programs to educate and train employees in
detecting and reporting spearphishing attempts.
