eSentire Threat Intelligence Malware Analysis:
CaddyWiper
esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-caddywiper

First discovered by ESET researchers in March 2022, CaddyWiper malware is a new type of
wiper malware used by Russian threat actors to target Ukrainian organizations, and the
fourth wiper identified since the invasion of the Ukraine. Unlike ransomware, the only
objective of using wiper malware is to damage files, data, hard drives, or entire programs
and cause as much destruction as possible in the targeted organization’s endpoints and
network.
eSentire’s Threat Intelligence (TI) team assesses with high confidence that as the hybrid war
between Russia and Ukraine continues, threat actors will continue developing more
destructive malware with the goal to disrupt the operations in Ukrainian infrastructure since
the wiping malware does not need to be sophisticated to perform the basic wiping
capabilities.

Key Takeaways
eSentire TI assesses that CaddyWiper has a low level of sophistication compared to
the other wipers observed targeting Ukrainian organizations (HermeticWiper).

CaddyWiper specifically doesn’t target Domain Controllers to keep the foothold on the
victim’s network to be able to obtain credentials, move laterally and infect more
machines.
eSentire TI assesses that it’s probable that this is done to keep the foothold on the
Domain Controller and gain access to other machines on the network.
eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) is currently implementing the detections
developed to identify CaddyWiper malware activities across MDR for Endpoint,
performing global threat hunts against the IOCs associated with the CaddyWiper
malware, and actively monitoring for any signs of compromise.

Case Study
The destructive malware named CaddyWiper was first reported by ESET Researchers on
March 14, 2022. The malware was first detected at 11:38 a.m. local time (5:38 a.m. EST)
targeting organizations in Ukraine. According to ESET, the infection mechanism is similar to
the HermeticWiper malware in that it operates via Default Domain Policy.

Technical Analysis on CaddyWiper
eSentire TI has observed 4 CaddyWiper samples targeting Ukrainian organizations in the
wild including a UPX packed version. CaddyWiper is the fourth wiper observed targeting
Ukrainian organizations since January 2022.
CaddyWiper is a PE32 (32-bit) executable written in C++ programming language with a file
size of 9.00 KB (9,216 bytes). The compilation timestamp for all the wiper samples dates to
March 14, 2022 (on the same day when the first attacks were observed).
The malware samples do not appear to be digitally signed except for one sample (SHA-256:
1e87e9b5ee7597bdce796490f3ee09211df48ba1d11f6e2f5b255f05cc0ba176). The file is
signed by TrustAsia (Exhibit 2).

The wiper uses stackstrings, which is the technique used by malware developers to
“conceal” the strings from an analyst (Exhibit 3).

The wiper checks if the infected machine is a Domain Controller via the
DsRoleGetPrimaryDomainInformation API. The API gets state data for the computer,
which includes the state of the directory service installation and domain data. If the infected
machine is not a Domain Controller, the malware recursively wipes the files in C:\Users and
D:\ directories. Additionally, CaddyWiper attempts to wipe the files in the driver letters
alphabetically starting from D:\ drive until it reaches Z:\ drive (Exhibit 4).
While running the sample on the sandbox machine, the malware did not wipe all the files
completely in the mentioned folders, except for shortcut files. The sample also skips wiping
the files under C:\ drive.

If the infected machine is the Domain Controller, the wiper will exit (Exhibit 5).

Exhibit 5: The malware doesn't proceed with executing the wiping instructions on a Domain
Controller

The jump to the function responsible for wiping the files is not taken. Instead, it will exit via
the RtlExitUserThread command (Exhibit 6).

The jump to the function responsible for wiping the files is not taken. Instead, it will exit via
the RtlExitUserThread command (Exhibit 6).

The wiper enumerates through the files, takes ownership of the files overrides File
Permissions with SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege and AdjustTokenPrivileges APIs and
overwrites 10485760 bytes of data with zeroes (Exhibit 7).

7/11

Exhibit 7: The wiper is overwriting 10485760 bytes of data with 0's

After the malware finishes overwriting the files, it uses the DeviceIoControl API with the
control code IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX to access the extended information
about the drive's partitions (decrements from Physical Drive 9 to Physical Drive 0).
Specifically, it accesses the data on the Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table
(GPT) partitions of the hard drives to proceed with the wiping process.

Exhibit 8: Decrementing loop (the wiper decrements the drives from 9 to 0)

We assess that the wiper sample does not have any similarities with the previous wipers
(WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper) that were used to target Ukrainian organizations.
The only distinctive characteristic of CaddyWiper is that it does not target Domain
8/11

Controllers. We believe it’s probable that this is done to keep the foothold on the Domain
Controller to gain access to other machines on the network and that CaddyWiper was
developed within one month or less.

What eSentire is doing about it
Our Threat Response Unit (TRU) combines threat intelligence gleaned from research,
security incidents, and the external threat landscape to create actionable outcomes for our
customers. We are taking a holistic response approach to combat all malware by deploying
countermeasures, such as:
Implementing the detections to identify CaddyWiper malware activities across eSentire
MDR for Endpoint solutions.
Performing global threat hunts against the IOCs associated with the CaddyWiper
malware
Actively monitoring for any signs of compromise.
Our detection content is backed by investigation runbooks, ensuring our SOC cyber analysts
respond rapidly to any intrusion attempts. In addition, our Threat Response Unit closely
monitors the threat landscape and addresses capability gaps and conducts retroactive threat
hunts to assess customer impact.

Recommendations from eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU)
We recommend implementing the following controls to help secure your organization against
the CaddyWiper malware:
Address security issues in Active Directory: thoroughly reviewing and securing
SYSVOL permissions, patching any known vulnerabilities, implementing LeastPrivilege Administrative Models.
If working with organizations based in Ukraine, perform access control review on the
traffic.
Confirm that all the devices are protected with Endpoint Detection and Response
(EDR) solutions.
While the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries grow in
sophistication, they lead to a limited set of choke points at which critical business decisions
must be made. Intercepting the various attack paths utilized by the modern threat actor
requires actively monitoring the threat landscape, developing, and deploying endpoint
detection, and the ability to investigate logs & network data during active intrusions.
eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) is a world-class team of threat researchers who
develop new detections enriched by original threat intelligence and leverage new machine
learning models that correlate multi-signal data and automate rapid response to advanced
9/11

threats.
