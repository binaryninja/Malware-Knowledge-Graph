INTRODUCTION
From April 19-24, 2017, a politically-motivated, targeted campaign was carried out

against numerous Israeli organizations. Morphisec researchers began investigating
the attacks on April 24 and continue to uncover more details. Initial reports of the
attacks, published April 26 (in Hebrew) by the Israel National Cyber Event
Readiness Team (CERT-IL) and The Marker, conﬁrm that the attack was delivered
through compromised email accounts at Ben-Gurion University and sent to multiple
targets across Israel. Ironically, Ben-Gurion University is home to Israel’s Cyber
Security Research Center. Investigators put the origin of the attack as Iranian;
Morphisec’s research supports this conclusion and attributes the attacks to the
same infamous hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns.
The attack was delivered via Microsoft Word documents that exploited a former
zero-day vulnerability in Word, CVE-2017-0199, to install a ﬁleless variant of the
Helminth Trojan agent. Microsoft released the patch for the vulnerability on April 11,
but many organizations have not yet deployed the update. The attackers actually
based their attack on an existing Proof-of-Concept method that was published by
researchers after the patch release.
By hunting through known malware repositories, Morphisec identiﬁed matching
samples uploaded by Israeli high-tech development companies, medical
organizations and education organizations, indicating that they were victims of the
attack. For security purposes, Morphisec is not revealing these names.
The delivery was executed by compromising the email accounts of a few highproﬁle individuals at Ben-Gurion University. The Word document was sent as a reply
to legitimate emails sent from those accounts and was propagated to more than 250
individuals in different Israeli companies, according to CERT-IL.
Upon deeper investigation into the installed Helminth ﬁleless agent, we identiﬁed a
near perfect match to the OilRig campaign executed by an Iranian hacker group
against 140 ﬁnancial institutions in the Middle East last year, as analyzed by
FireEye , Palo Alto Networks and Logrhythm. This group has become one of the
most active threat actors, with noteworthy abilities, resources and infrastructure;
speculations indicate the hacking organization to be sponsored by the Iranian
government. In other recent attacks (January 2017), the group used a fake Juniper
Networks VPN portal and fake University of Oxford websites to deliver malware as
described by ClearSky.
Our report presents the technical details of the attack, emphasizing differences from
last year’s attack. In particular, there are several enhancements to different evasive
mechanisms and some modiﬁcations in the communications protocol, which
delivers PowerShell commands from the C&C.
The most important difference is that the use of macros was exchanged with a
vulnerability exploit. With their ability to set up the attack in a relatively short time,
the threat actors could correctly speculate that their window of opportunity between

patch release and patch rollout was still open.
At the time of publication, the C&C servers are still active and will be listed herein as
all other signatures and indicators of compromise.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

The different delivered documents, as shown below, are generally named with some
random number <random number>.doc.

Morphisec identiﬁed the following set of documents:

CVE-2017-0199 Vulnerability Exploit
The most notable difference from last year’s OilRig campaign is the way the attack
was delivered. In the previous campaign, the Iranian group sent specially crafted
Excel and Word ﬁles, which contained macros that targeted individuals were
convinced to enable.
In this campaign, no macros were required. Each document utilized the vulnerability
by an embedded link that delivers an .hta ﬁle (html executable).

Morphisec identiﬁed the following delivered test<number>.hta ﬁle with the same
signature delivered from the following domains:

Name

Delivery Server

test4.hta

hxxp://comonscar[.]in (82.145.40.46)

The .hta ﬁle is immediately executed by mshta.exe, the Windows process which
executes html executables. As a result, the user is usually shown a warning
message, despite the fact that the HTA is still executed even if the user chooses
“No”:

The .hta ﬁle in this attack is much more sophisticated than in previous versions, and
actually disables this message by sending an “Enter” command to the warning
window. This is covered in the next section.

HTA Execution and Persistency
The HTA execution goes through the following steps:
1. Before installing the agent, the .hta ﬁle sends the “Enter” key into the Word
application to remove the warning message and minimize any appearance of
suspicious execution. It is done by creating and executing a 1.vbs script.

2. The next step writes and executes the 0011.ps1 PowerShell script, which is
described in the following section.

3. The last step kills the original process that activated the .hta ﬁle, to remove any
suspicion.

Helminth Trojan Installation and Persistency
0011.ps1 script, which is activated by the .hta ﬁle, is in charge of generating the
Helminth Trojan PowerShell and VBS ﬁles.

1.vbs

BE7F1D411CC4160BB221C7181DA4370972B6C867AF110C12850CAD779819

Morphisec identiﬁed the following structure:

This structure matches the attack structure from October 2016, as described by
Logrhythm:

Aside the unique generation of the ﬁles, the structure and the functionality of the
trojan is very similar to the previous campaign:
1. The PowerShell script ps1 creates similar variants of Helminth trojan
PowerShell and VBS ﬁles templates (DnS1.Ps1, DnE1.Ps1, backup1.vbs).
Those templates are regenerated on the infected computer by replacement of
all variables and function names to random names in order to slow down

detection and remediation.

2. All the scripts are installed in the Public\Libraries\RecordedTV\ folder.
3. As in the previous campaign, persistency is achieved by adding a schedule
task with a similar name to the Google update task
(“GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI”), which executes vbs every 3 minutes:

Note: All the parameters in the 0011.ps1 script can be reconﬁgured, therefore
some of the names could be different for the tasks and locations.

Communication Protocol
We will focus here on the DnE1.Ps1 ﬁle because all other ﬁles are almost identical
to the previous campaign. This ﬁle executes some of the same commands executed
by VBS script in the previous campaign, but there are differences as well. The script
connects to a C&C server – vpsupdate[.]tk. At the time of this report’s publication,
the C&C server is still live; the server was ﬁrst registered on April 16, 2017. The goal
of the script is to:
Download bat script
Execute it and upload the results back to the C&C
Clear traces

At each new activation (ﬁrst) activation of the download command (GET request),
the infected computer receives a bat script for activation from the C&C:
vpsupdate[.]tk/index.aspx?id=<random character><randomnumber>[b] (the “b”
is for download)
The ﬁle name of the bat script is then delivered through the response headers, and
the content of the bat script is delivered through the response. Both of them are
encoded in base 64.

The name of the ﬁle is default.bat (decoded from Content-Disposition property in the
header) and it is saved temporary in the dn folder (described in the next section).
Note: Morphisec identiﬁed several other samples of communication with different
C&C servers (“alenupdate[.]info” and “maralen[.]tk”) in which a more advanced
customized version of Mimikatz was sent to speciﬁc users, and an additional agent
was installed in the “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Idle\” directory:

Back to the popular variant of the protocol: As soon as the ﬁle executes and the
result output is written to default.bat.txt (similarly to the previous campaign), the
resulting ﬁle is uploaded back to the C&C using the following URL command (POST
request):
vpsupdate[.]tk/index.aspx?id=<random character><randomnumber>[u] (the “u”
is for upload)

At the same time, the DnE1.Ps1 is executed. The DnS1.Ps1 is also executed and
communicates with the C&C using DNS exchange queries (the same as in the
previous campaign). This kind of communication is very hard to block since DNS is
a basic functionality required in any organization.

Delivered Commands
The bat script is a customized version of Mimikatz (with slight modiﬁcation from the
last campaign). Its goal is to gather information from the computer and the network:

The added commands are chcp to handle non-ASCII characters (e.g. Hebrew) and
the validation of the scheduled task (which should have been added by the
persistency mechanism).
As mentioned in the previous section, Morphisec identiﬁed an advanced version of
the same bat script communicating with the alenupdate[.]info C&C. In that case, the
information that is gathered includes A.V., Firewall and AntiSpy product information.
The persistent tasks are slightly different as well, “Google Update Core” and
“Google Sync Core”.

Remediation
1. The scheduled task “GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI” should be removed. Note
that regular Google update tasks look like GoogleUpdateTask[Machine|User]*
without the “s” in Tasks).
1. In case “Google Update Core” or “Google Sync Core” exists, those need
to be removed as well.
2. Access Public\Libraries\RecordedTV folder. Note that the Libraries folder in
Public is hidden, and you should delete the folder and not the RecordedTV
icon – if you have only the icon, then the agent is not installed.
3. If the following directory exists, remove it: “Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Idle”
4. If the following directory contains “WinInit.lnk” or “SyncInit.lnk” ﬁles, remove
those ﬁles: “%userproﬁle%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup”

Conclusion
Every few years, a new “logic bug” CVE in OLE object linking is identiﬁed; the
previous one was three years ago (CVE-2014-0640). This kind of vulnerability is

rare but powerful. It allows attackers to embed OLE objects (or links in the case of
CVE-2017-0199) and bypass Microsoft validation of OLE execution without warning.
In essence, it is the same as playing animation in PowerPoint.

Such vulnerabilities should be patched immediately.
It is signiﬁcant to note how the Iranian threat actors advanced their abilities in such
a short time:
Utilizing a vulnerability PoC immediately after its publication
Setting up the required infrastructure with multiple domains and delivery
servers
Increasing the sophistication of the delivered Helminth agent, including
regeneration of its signatures on the infected computer
Improving the customized information gathering Mimikatz version
With many organizations taking high-risk vulnerabilities seriously and patching them
as quickly as possible, attackers can no longer exploit them for an extended period
of time. We therefore expect that threat actors will return to macro-based campaigns
like Hancitor.
