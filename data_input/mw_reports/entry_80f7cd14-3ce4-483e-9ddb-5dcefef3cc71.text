Overview
ICS-CERT has received reports and investigated infections of the Mariposaa botnet, which
have affected the business networks of multiple control system owners in recent months.
ICS-CERT has no information to indicate that these infections have specifically targeted
United States Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR), or any specific sector or
organization.

Background
In May 2009, Defence Intelligence announced the discovery of a botnet, called “Mariposa.”
An investigation followed this discovery and targeted bringing down the criminal network
behind what has become one of the largest botnets on record.
After months of investigation by the Guardia Civil in Spain, the FBI, security firm Panda
Security, and Defence Intelligence, authorities took down a 12.7 million strong zombie
network in December. In February 2010, Spanish authorities arrested three suspects in
Spain.b
Although the primary command and control (C2) infrastructure for the Mariposa botnet is
considered to have been rendered inoperative by the Mariposa Working Group,c malware
files that were used by the botnet are still thought to be on computers in production
environments and should be identified and removed. Additionally, it is not uncommon for new
groups to assume control of old or abandoned botnets by compromising existing command
and control or by establishing new command and control infrastructure using slightly
modified malware.

Details

1/8

In February 2010, a US utility company (USUTIL1) was notified by another US Utility partner
company (USUTIL2) that a USUTIL1 employee had visited USUTIL2 with a Mariposainfected laptop. There had been no indication from USUTIL1’s computer network defense
mechanisms (Anti-Virus, Intrusion Detection Systems, Firewalls etc.) that an infection had
occurred and USUTIL2’s notification was USUTIL1’s first indication that there was an issue.
USUTIL1’s investigation found that the initial infection vector may have been a USB drive
shared at an industry conference. An instructor shared a USB drive among participants at a
training event attended by USUTIL1’s employee. It is believed that when the employee
returned and connected his laptop to the corporate network, the malware spread to multiple
business systems.
To date, none of USUTIL1’s control systems are known to be affected by the botnet malware.
USUTIL1’s internal investigation found the malware file “Schl.exe” in deleted files on one
system. USUTIL1’s continued searching and found other systems with this deleted file.
These systems were also attempting to make UDP connections with systems outside of their
firewall.
ICS-CERT was contacted and at the request of the organization, deployed a fly-away team
to assist with identification and analysis of the malware.

Analysis
A dynamic analysis was made on the file schl.exe. The method used for code injection is
similar to the method described by Defence Intelligenced however, callbacks appeared to be
unique. It should be noted that the following information is solely from ICS-CERT’s
investigation into the malware variant found at USUTIL1. This information, along with other
open source information should be leveraged in any comprehensive detection and mitigation
activities.
The following information can be used to develop detection signatures:

File: SCHL.EXE
Size: 140800
MD5: 645C4DD7508B3DC83807FCF9918FE1C7
SHA1: d452e2df58fad206b2213683356033822ff335c9
Type: PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit

Antivirus Identification
Microsoft: Trojan:Win32/Meredrop
Mcafee: Backdoor-EEC.gen
Symantec: Trojan Horse

Note: All network traffic in/out is UDP
The initial outbound packet is 49 bytes (7 bytes encrypted payload) to hnox[dot]org or
socksa[dot]com, using UDP port 21039, for the purpose of establishing the C2 channel. The
C2 server responds from 21039 to the same local port, with a UDP packet of varying length
and encrypted payload. C2 command syntax appears to be consistent with the Mariposa
botnet.

Malware Files
schl.exe – dropper
jack.exe – dropped file
config.inf – dropped file
desktop.ini – dropped file (0-byte file located at source of originally executed file)
Botnets, including Mariposa, are highly dynamic. C2 operators frequently update their code
to evade detection or implement new features. Other files may also be associated with
Mariposa, so the list above is not a complete list of files used by Mariposa. For example,
Defence Intelligenceee has also identified blackjackson.exe, which provided Mariposa with
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) capability by using the BlackEnergy DDoS bot.

Windows Registry Modifications
Key: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon]
Value: "Taskman" = "<file_path>\schl.exe"
Note: Where "file path" = location of schl.exe when executed

Affected Operating Systems
Although botnet malware can affect any operating system, most current botnets including
Mariposa target Windows systems.f

Impact
Although the primary Mariposa C2 is believed to be inactive, the malware is still spreading.
The possibility exists that another actor will attempt to “commandeer” the existing C2 or
create a new C2 infrastructure. Without C2 direction, the malware won’t perform malicious
actions; however, the malware still presents a risk and any remaining Mariposa malware
should be identified, removed, and systems should be properly re-imaged or restored if reimaging is not feasible.
Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each
organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this
vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.

Recommendations
5/8

Because IP addresses, UDP ports, and domains used by the C2 structure of Mariposa
changed continually, it created a difficult challenge for security administrators to mitigate the
capabilities of this botnet. The best mitigation strategy is to track down compromised
systems using all information available about the malware. Organizations should establish
firewall rules to block communication from malware to known command and control sites and
monitor their network for this activity to identify compromised machines. Additionally, UDP
connections are used for Mariposa communication, so observance of your network activity is
the best place to start. If one system is frequently sending outbound UDP packets,
regardless of port, mark it as suspicious and investigate the source of the traffic on the
system.
It is important to identify all of the infected machines and to disable them simultaneously to
prevent re-infection of your assets. Advanced threats such as botnets can be extremely
difficult to eradicate. If a compromised system is missed, the threat can re-infect “clean”
systems. Clean systems should be isolated while the remainder of the network is cleaned, or
the clean systems risk being re-infected. In large networks, this can be a challenging
exercise.
As mentioned, IP addresses, ports, and domains used by Mariposa’s C2 system have
continually changed. These changes created new malware variants (mariposa had over
1,500 variants) resulting in a persistent and dynamic botnet. It is important to use all
available information when eradicating and defending against a botnet infection to ensure
that all variants are detected and properly removed.
Here are some general guidelines for dealing with Mariposa malware:
Any infected systems should be immediately isolated from the network.
Any systems sharing network drives with the infected systems, including file servers
hosting said network drives, should also be isolated from the network.Reimage infected
hosts prior to returning to normal operation.
Consider maintaining an infected system for more detailed analysis (i.e., digital media
analysis, malware collection).
Review antivirus software specific removal guidelines for the malware if re-imaging is
not possible.
Users should refrain from or be administratively prohibited from browsing the Internet
using Windows accounts with Administrator-level privileges. This reduces the potential
damage an infection can inflict upon a system.
Organizations should warn users about the risks of using USB drives on business
systems. For more information, review ICS-CERT CSAR -10-090-01- USBs Used as
Attack Vectorg and US-CERT Cyber Security Tip ST08-001, “Using Caution with USB
Drives.”g
Keep systems up to date with the latest patches and antivirus signatures.
Establish an internet proxy service and monitor it for suspicious activity.
