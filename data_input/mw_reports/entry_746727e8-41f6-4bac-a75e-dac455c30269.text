Team

Key Takeaways
Those involved in media make for appealing targets given the unique access, information,
and insights they can provide on topics of state-designated import.
Proofpoint researchers have observed APT actors since early 2021 regularly targeting and
posing as journalists and media organizations to advance their state-aligned collection
requirements and initiatives.
The identified campaigns have leveraged a variety of techniques from using web beacons for
reconnaissance to sending malware to establish initial access into the target’s network.
The focus on media by APTs is unlikely to ever wane, making it important for journalists to
protect themselves, their sources, and the integrity of their information by ensuring they have
an accurate threat model and secure themselves appropriately.

Overview
Journalists and media organizations suffer from many of the same threats as everyone else.
Between threat actors wanting to steal credentials to resell or to utilize compromised hosts for
brokered initial access to spread ransomware, among other threats, this sector is no stranger to
the dangers of the threat landscape. Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, however, look to
those in the field of media for different purposes; ones that could have far-reaching impacts.
Journalists and media organizations are well sought-after targets with Proofpoint researchers
observing APT actors, specifically those that are state-sponsored or state-aligned, routinely
masquerading as or targeting journalists and media organizations because of the unique access
and information they can provide. The media sector and those that work within it can open doors
that others cannot. A well-timed, successful attack on a journalist’s email account could provide
insights into sensitive, budding stories and source identification. A compromised account could be
used to spread disinformation or pro-state propaganda, provide disinformation during times of war

or pandemic, or be used to influence a politically charged atmosphere. Most commonly, phishing
attacks targeting journalists are used for espionage or to gain key insights into the inner workings
of another government, company, or other area of state-designated import.
Proofpoint data since early 2021 shows a sustained effort by APT actors worldwide attempting to
target or leverage journalists and media personas in a variety of campaigns, including those welltimed to sensitive political events in the United States. Some campaigns have targeted the media
for a competitive intelligence edge while others have targeted journalists immediately following
their coverage painting a regime in a poor light or as a means to spread disinformation or
propaganda. For the purposes of this report, we focus on the activities of a handful of APT actors
assessed to be aligned with the state interests of China, North Korea, Iran, and Turkey.

Targeting Journalists’ Work Email Accounts
As observed in Proofpoint data, targeting journalists’ work email accounts is by far the most seen
locus of attack used by APT actors against this target set. It is important to note that journalists are
communicating with external, foreign, and often semi-anonymous parties to gather information.
This outreach increases the risk of phishing since journalists, often by necessity, communicate with
unknown recipients more so than the average user. Verifying or gaining access to such accounts
can be an entry point for threat actors for later stage attacks on a media organization’s network or
to gain access to desired information.

China
Since early 2021, the APT actor tracked by Proofpoint as TA412, known also as Zirconium based
on public reporting by Microsoft about a phishing reconnaissance team within this larger APT
threat actor designation, has engaged in numerous reconnaissance phishing campaigns targeting
US-based journalists. TA412, which is believed to be aligned with the Chinese state interest and to
have strategic espionage objectives, has favored using malicious emails containing web beacons
in these campaigns. This is a technique consistently used by the threat actor since at least 2016,
however, it was likely in use for years prior. Web beacons, which are commonly referred to as
tracking pixels, tracking beacons, and web bugs, embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the
body of an email that, when enabled, attempts to retrieve a benign image file from an actorcontrolled server.
Proofpoint researchers assess these campaigns have been intended to validate targeted emails
are active and to gain fundamental information about the recipients’ network environments. Web
beacons can provide the following technical artifacts to an attacker which, in turn, can serve as
reconnaissance information as a threat actor plans their next stage of attack:
Externally visible IP addresses
User-Agent string
Email address
Validation that the targeted user account is active

4/17

The campaigns by TA412 and their ilk evolved over the course of months, adjusting lures to best fit
the current US political environment and switching to target US-based journalists focused on
different areas of interest to the Chinese government. The campaigns which targeted journalists
were part of a broader pattern of reconnaissance phishing conducted by this threat actor over
many years.
2021: Between January and February 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified five campaigns by
TA412 targeting US-based journalists, most notably those covering US politics and national
security during events that gained international attention. Of note a very abrupt shift in targeting of
reconnaissance phishing occurred in the days immediately preceding the 6 January 2021 attack
on the US Capitol Building. Proofpoint researchers observed a focus on Washington DC and White
House correspondents during this time. The malicious emails utilized subject lines pulled from
recent US news articles, such as “Jobless Benefits Run Out as Trump Resists Signing Relief Bill,”
“US issues Russia threat to China,” and “Trump Call to Georgia Official Might Violate State and
Federal Law.”
The message bodies duplicated text included in the news articles and the web beacon URLs
included a benign PNG file with a 0x0 aspect ratio that was retrieved as part of the web beacon in
the following format:
hxxp://www.actor-controlled domain[.]com/Free/<Targeted User Email
Fragment>/0103/Customer.png.
The URL structure designates an actor-controlled domain, a campaign identifier, a victim identifier,
a campaign date, and the name of the benign PNG resource.

block downloadable content, then the web beacon URL should be presented to the target with an
option to download the remote content, as seen in this image.
In August 2021, after a months-long break, TA412 again turned to targeting journalists, but this
time those working cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy issues with a focus on China. Those
targeted appeared to have written extensively on social media privacy issues and Chinese
disinformation campaigns, signaling an interest by the Chinese state in media narratives that could
push a negative global opinion or perception of China. These campaigns mirrored those identified
earlier in 2021 but demonstrated an evolving web beacon URL structure that changes over time.
The observed structure was:
hxxp://[actor-controlled
domain/IP]/stringhere/AbbreviatedVictimAddress[@]AbbreviatedTargetedOrganization/filename[.
]png.
2022: After an observed pause in targeting journalists, Proofpoint researchers identified a
resumption of targeting this sector on February 9, 2022. The campaigns were numerous and
occurred over a period of ten days. These campaigns strongly resembled those noted in early
2021 and indicated a desire to collect on US-based media organizations and contributors with a
focus on those reporting on US and European engagement in the anticipated Russia-Ukraine war.
Subjects included:
New bill aims to prohibit US military aid to Ukraine
US issues Russia threat to China
Macron reveals Putin 'guarantees'
UK to arm Ukraine with anti-ship missiles against Russia - Kiev's envoy
US says how Ukraine stand-off can be resolved
UK says invasion 'highly likely'
White House says door for diplomacy with Russia remains open, but troop buildup is
continuing
Another Chinese APT group, TA459, in late April 2022 targeted media personnel with emails
containing a malicious Royal Road RTF attachment (acknowledge.doc) that, if opened, would
install and execute Chinoxy malware. This malware is a backdoor that is used to gain persistence
on a victim’s machine. Researchers at Bitdefender have observed the threat actor’s use of
Chinoxy extensively in Southeast Asia since at least 2018. Of note, the targeted entity was
responsible for reporting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which aligns with TA459’s historic
mandate of collecting on intelligence matters related to Russia and Belarus.

This campaign used a possibly compromised Pakistani government email address to send the
emails and looked to entice media recipients with a lure on foreign policy in Afghanistan. To add to
the credibility of the emails, TA459 included links to a benign YouTube video produced by the
Islamabad Security Dialogue, which references disinformation campaigns.

North Korea
In a vengeful twist, the North Korea-aligned TA404 in early 2022 targeted a US-based media
organization with job opportunity-themed phishing. This attack occurred after the organization
published an article critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un—a well-known motivator for
action by North Korea-aligned APT actors. TA404, known more broadly as Lazarus, typically
engages in highly targeted campaigns that begin with benign messages. This campaign aligned
with that expected behavior. It started with reconnaissance phishing that used URLs customized to
each recipient. The URLs impersonated a job posting with landing pages designed to look like a
branded job posting site. If a victim interacted with the URL, which contained a unique target ID,
the server resolving the domain would have received confirmation that the email was delivered,
and the intended target had interacted with it. This request also provides identifying information
about the computer, or device, allowing the host to keep track of the intended target.
While Proofpoint researchers did not observe follow-up emails, considering this threat actor’s
proclivity for later sending malware-laden email attachments, it is likely that TA404 would have
attempted to send malicious template document attachment or something similar in the future.
Researchers at the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on March 24, 2022 disclosed details on
this campaign as part of “Operation Dream Job.” While journalism and media were not listed
among the targeted sectors, Proofpoint has observed shared indicators of compromise utilized in
both campaigns identified earlier this year and those reported by Google TAG.

Targeting Journalists’ Social Media Accounts
Targeting journalists and media organizations for their social media account credentials can have
significant consequences. For example, in 2013 a threat actor took over the official Associated
Press Twitter account and posted a tweet claiming President Barack Obama had been injured in
an attack on the White House. The stock market dropped more than 100 points in roughly two
minutes following the tweet. Two years later, in 2015, a threat actor compromised about 130
Twitter accounts of influential individuals and tricked some of their followers into transferring more
than $100,000 in Bitcoin to attacker-controlled accounts.
While often times campaigns looking to compromise social media accounts, including those by
APTs, do not result in such severe or observable outcomes, they can still wind up requiring more
than just an account reset or the activation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially since
enabling MFA is not a guarantee of complete account protection.

Turkey
Since early 2022, Proofpoint researchers have observed a prolific threat actor, tracked as TA482,
regularly engaging in credential harvesting campaigns that target the social media accounts of
mostly US-based journalists and media organizations. This victimology, TA482’s use of services
originating from Turkey to host its domains and infrastructure, as well as Turkey’s history of
leveraging social media to spread pro-President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and pro-Justice and
Development Party (Turkey’s ruling party) propaganda support Proofpoint’s assessment that
TA482 is aligned with the Turkish state.
Ongoing campaigns have narrowed in on Twitter credentials of any individuals that write for media
publications. This includes journalists from well-known news outlets to those writing for an
academic institution and everything in-between. The malicious emails are typically Twitter security
themed and attempt to grab a recipient’s attention with subjects alerting the user to a suspicious or
new login location.

If the target clicks on the link supplied in the email, they are taken to a credential harvesting
landing page which impersonates a Twitter login page to reset their password.

Figure 5. A TA482 landing page designed to steal a user’s credentials.
Proofpoint researchers cannot independently verify the motivations behind these campaigns, but
the possibilities abound and, based on historical Turkey threat actor activity, could include using
the compromised accounts to target a journalist’s social media contacts, use the accounts for
defacement, or to spread propaganda. It is possible these attacks will ramp up as Turkey’s 2023
parliamentary and presidential elections draw near.

Posing as Journalists
There is an inherent sense of intrigue when one is approached by a journalist to discuss an area of
expertise. The allure of having research highlighted in the media is often a great motivator to
overlook or disregard signs that this opportunity may not be entirely legitimate. This social
engineering tactic successfully exploits the human desire for recognition and is being leveraged by
APT actors wishing to target academics and foreign policy experts worldwide, likely in an effort to
gain access to sensitive information.

Iran
Multiple Iran-aligned APT actors use journalists or newspapers as pretexts to surveil targets and
attempt to harvest their credentials. One of the most active in Proofpoint telemetry is TA453, also
known as Charming Kitten. TA453, which we assess with high confidence supports the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps intelligence collection efforts, routinely masquerades as journalists

11/17

from around the world. The threat actor uses these personas to engage in benign conversations
with targets, which consist mostly of academics and policy experts working on Middle Eastern
foreign affairs.
As can be seen in Figure 6, the content of TA453’s initial outreach emails indicate a degree of
research on the intended target likely to enhance the believability of the request and to encourage
further dialogue.

Figure 6. Screenshot of a benign TA453 conversation starter, posted by and used with permission
from Mahsa Alimardani via Twitter.
If the initial email is ignored, TA453 will often recontact individuals to follow up (Figure 7). If the
targeted recipient does engage in conversation with the persona, TA453 will eventually invite them
to a virtual meeting to have further discussions via a customized, but benign PDF (Figure 8).

12/17

Figure 8. Example of a TA453 benign PDF uploaded to VirusTotal.
The vast majority of TA453 campaigns ultimately lead to credential harvesting. The benign PDFs,
similar to Figure 8, are typically delivered from file hosting services and almost always contain a
link to a URL shortener and IP tracker that redirects targets to the credential harvesting domains
on actor-controlled infrastructure.

Figure 9. Standard TA453 attack chain.
TA456, also known as Tortoiseshell, is another Iran-aligned threat actor that routinely
masquerades as media organizations sending newsletters across the ideological spectrum,
including Fox News and the Guardian. TA456 has repeatedly targeted the same users with
newsletter themed emails containing web beacons. This activity likely has complemented TA456's
efforts to deliver malware via relationships built on social media similar to previous campaigns.

emails.

Lastly, TA457, an Iran-aligned threat actor active in Proofpoint data since late 2021, has been
known to masquerade as an “iNews Reporter” to deliver malware to public relations personnel for
companies located in the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. For example, in early March 2022, TA457
sent an email with the ironic subject “Iran Cyber War” and the actor-controlled domain newsspot[.]live. The campaign continued TA457’s pattern of using news themed lure websites to deliver
a malicious URL. The URL structure (news-spot[.]live/Reports/1/?id=[Campaign/Lure
Identifier]&pid=[TargetIdentifier]) has both an identifier to track which lure documents to deliver
along with a PID to determine which recipient is receiving the phish. The themes of documents
have included Iran, Russia, drones, war crimes, “secret weapons,” and more. When a user clicks
the malicious URL, two files are downloaded: a Word document and an .scr file. When macros are
enabled on the document, it drops an embedded executable file (DnsDig.exe). When the
reader.scr file is dropped, it downloads DnsDig.exe from the URL and also drops iran.pdf as a
decoy to the user. DnsDig is a TA457 remote access trojan that uses DNS tunneling to a
hardcoded domain (cyberclub[.]one). Figure 11. Attack chain of TA457 “Iran Cyber War”
campaign.

Figure 11. Attack chain of TA457 “Iran Cyber War” campaign.
Between September 2021 and March 2022, Proofpoint observed TA457 campaigns approximately
every two to three weeks. The March 2022 campaign targeted both individual and generic, group
email addresses such as international.media@[redacted].com at less than ten Proofpoint
customers involved in energy, media, government, and manufacturing.

Conclusion
Targeting journalists and media organizations is not novel. APT actors, regardless of their state
affiliation, have and will likely always have a mandate to target journalists and media organizations
and will use associated personas to further their objectives and collection priorities. From
intentions to gather sensitive information to attempts to manipulate public perceptions, the
16/17

knowledge and access that a journalist or news outlet can provide is unique in the public space.
Targeting the media sector also lowers the risk of failure or discovery to an APT actor than going
after other, more hardened targets of interest, such as government entities.
The varied approaches by APT actors—using web beacons for reconnaissance, credential
harvesting, and sending malware to gain a foothold in a recipient’s network—means those
operating in the media space need to stay vigilant. Assessing one’s personal level of risk can give
an individual a good sense of the odds they will end up as a target. Such as, if you report on China
or North Korea or associated threat actors, you may become part of their collection requirements
in the future. Being aware of the broad attack surface—all the varied online platforms used for
sharing information and news—an APT actor can leverage is also key to preventing oneself from
becoming a victim. And ultimately practicing caution and verifying the identity or source of an email
can halt an APT attack in its nascent stage.
