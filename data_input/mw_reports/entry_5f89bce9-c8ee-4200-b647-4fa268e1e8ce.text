Executive summary
A previously unconfirmed, financially motivated threat group operating under the selfproclaimed name, “Karakurt” started ramping up attacks late in the third quarter of
2021 and continued into the fourth quarter.
The presence of Karakurt was first identified in June 2021 as it registered its apparent
dump-site domains: karakurt[.]group and karakurt[.]tech, followed by their Twitter
handle “karakurtlair” in August 2021.
Accenture Security first observed Karakurt intrusion clusters in September 2021,
when multiple sightings occurred within a short timeframe.
The threat group has claimed to have impacted over 40 victims across multiple
industries between September 2021 and November 2021.
Of note, Karakurt focuses solely on data exfiltration and subsequent extortion, rather
than the more destructive ransomware deployment.
Accenture Security observed the threat group modify its tactics depending on the
victim environment, favoring a more “living off the land” approach and often avoiding
the use of common post-exploitation tools like Cobalt Strike.
While Accenture Security identified that the threat group utilized attack infrastructure
previously associated with other cybercrime operators, we are not yet able to
determine if the threat group operates under an affiliate-based model, or a
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, based on observed intrusion clusters.
Accenture Security assess with high confidence that the group's operations have just
begun, and that Karakurt activity will likely continue to proliferate into the foreseeable
future, impacting additional victims.
The information outlined in this blog is based on information collected from CIFR incident
response engagements, threat intelligence insights, open-source intelligence (OSINT)
analysis and various media and industry reports.
This is a developing story; additional technical analysis of the intrusion clusters, attacker
TTPs and indicators of compromise (IOCs) will be released to the community in a separate
blog post.

Summary & timeline
Accenture Security has identified a new threat group, the self-proclaimed Karakurt Hacking
Team, that has impacted over 40 victims across multiple geographies. The threat group is
financially motivated, opportunistic in nature, and so far, appears to target smaller
companies or corporate subsidiaries versus the alternative big game hunting approach.
Based on intrusion analysis to date, the threat group focuses solely on data exfiltration and
subsequent extortion, rather than the more destructive ransomware deployment. In
addition, Accenture Security assesses with moderate-to-high confidence that the threat
group’s extortion approach includes steps to avoid, as much as possible, drawing attention
to its activities.

Victimology
Based on our collection sources, Accenture Security is currently aware of over 40 victims
spanning multiple industry verticals and size. The Karakurt group does not appear to focus
on a specific industry vertical or size. Of known victims, 95% are based in North America
with the remaining 5% in Europe. From our investigations into the group’s activity, we
5/11

determined that it typically uses credential access as the initial vector into victims’ networks
and utilizes applications already installed to move laterally and exfiltrate data, if available. In
addition, the threat group will typically contact the victim multiple times, using different
communication methods, to apply additional pressure during extortion attempts. Figure 5
includes the known impacted industry verticals to date, based on Accenture Security’s
collection sources.

Compromise activity & detection opportunities
Initial access

The primary method for initial access into victim networks includes internet-facing systems
via virtual private network (VPN) using legitimate credentials. Due to a lack of forensic
evidence, it is unclear how the credentials were obtained by the threat group. One
possibility is exploitation of vulnerable VPN devices, but all cases included inconsistent or
absent enforcement of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.
In Table 1 below, Accenture Security noted logons from four different hosting providers, to
include the autonomous system that currently hosts the Karakurt group’s blog site.

Persistence

The use of legitimate credentials, service creation, remote management software and
distribution of command and control (C2) beacons across victim environments using Cobalt
Strike are the predominant approaches used by the threat group to further its foothold and
maintain persistence.
However, in recent intrusions, the threat group did not deploy backup persistence using
Cobalt Strike. Instead, it persisted within the victim’s network via the VPN IP pool or
installed AnyDesk to allow external remote access to compromised devices. The group was
then able to leverage previously obtained user, service, and administrator credentials to
move laterally and take action on objectives.
Privilege escalation

Accenture Security observed the threat group leveraging Mimikatz in at least one intrusion
set, as well as PowerShell to dump ntds.dit and exfiltrate it for offline analysis.
However, the threat group appears to escalate privileges using the aforementioned
techniques and tools only if needed, typically using previously obtained credentials.
Defense evasion

Using valid credentials, pre-existing “living off the land” tools and techniques and remote
management software has enabled the threat group to further evade defenses.
In one intrusion, Accenture Security also observed the threat group avoiding the use of
common post-exploitation tools or commodity malware in favor of credential access. This
approach enabled it to evade detection and bypass security tools such as common
endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
Discovery

If the threat group’s preferred tools are not present within victims’ networks, it will download
common remote management and file transfer utilities via a browser to support subsequent
exfiltration activities (e.g., AnyDesk, FileZilla, 7zip, etc.).

7/11

The threat group was also observed running internet speed tests via a browser to check for
upload speeds before executing exfiltration activities. In addition, the use of Angry IP
Scanner was identified in at least one intrusion set.
Lateral movement

The threat group has been known to use AnyDesk, or other available remote management
tools, remote desktop protocol (RDP), Cobalt Strike, PowerShell commands and valid
credentials taken from initial access to move laterally.
Command and control

In addition to using valid credentials to log into the VPN directly, the threat group has
utilized Cobalt Strike for C2 for backup persistence, if needed.
Exfiltration and impact

The threat group has been seen utilizing 7zip and WinZip for compression, as well as
Rclone or FileZilla (SFTP) for staging and final exfiltration to Mega.io cloud storage.
The staging directories utilized for exfiltration were C:\Perflogs and C:\Recovery.

Suggested mitigations
Employ robust and routine user-awareness and training regimens for users of all
systems.
Ensure that a robust crisis management and incident response plan are in place in the
event of a high impact intrusion.
Maintain best practices against malware, such as patching, updating anti-virus
software, implementing strict network egress policies, and using application
whitelisting where feasible.
Patch infrastructure to the highest available level, as threat actors are often better
able to exploit older systems with existing vulnerabilities.

8/11

Ensure all internet-facing security and remote access appliances are patched to the
latest versions.
Disable RDP on external-facing devices and restrict workstation-to-workstation RDP
connections.
Employ a strong corporate password policy that includes industry standards for
password length, complexity, and expiration dates for both human and non-human
accounts.
Use MFA where possible for authenticating corporate accounts to include remote
access mechanisms and security tools. Admin accounts should be cross-platform
MFA enforced.
Use admin accounts only for administrative purposes and never to connect to the
network or browse the internet.
Do not store unprotected credentials in files and scripts on shared locations.
Deploy EDR across the environment, targeting at least 90% coverage of endpoint and
workload visibility.
Encrypt data at rest where possible and protect related keys and technology.
Hunt for attacker TTPs, including common “living off the land” techniques, to
proactively detect and respond to a cyber-attack and mitigate its impact.
