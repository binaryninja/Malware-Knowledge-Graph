The Carbanak ﬁnancial APT group made the headlines when Group-IB and Fox-IT broke
the news in December 2014, followed by the Kaspersky report in February 2015. The two
reports describe the same cybercriminal gang which stole up to several hundreds of
millions of dollars from various ﬁnancial institutions.
However, the story is interesting not only because of the large amount of money stolen
but also from a technical point of view. The Carbanak team does not just blindly
compromise large numbers of computers and try to ‘milk the cow’ as other actors do,
instead they act like a mature APT-group. They only compromise speciﬁc high-value
targets and once inside the company networks, move laterally to hosts that can be
monetized.
A few days ago CSIS published details about new Carbanak samples found in the wild.
In this blog we will describe the latest developments in the Carbanak story.

Casino hotel hack
At the end of August, we detected an attempt to compromise the network of a casino hotel
in the USA. The infection vector used in this attack may have been a spearphishing e-mail
with a malicious attachment using an RTF-exploit or .SCR ﬁle. The attackers’ aim was to
compromise PoS servers used in payment processing.
The main backdoor used by attackers was the open-source Tiny Meterpreter. In this case,
however, the source was modiﬁed – the process injection to svchost.exe was added to its
functionality.
This Tiny Meterpreter backdoor dropped two diﬀerent malware families:
Win32/Spy.Sekur – well known malware used by the Carbanak gang
Win32/Wemosis – a PoS RAM Scraper backdoor
As mentioned here by our colleagues from TrendMicro, Carbanak malware is capable of
targeting Epicor/NSB PoS systems, while Win32/Wemosis is a general-purpose PoS RAM
Scraper which targets any PoS that stores card data in the memory. The Wemosis
backdoor is written in Delphi and allows the attacker to control an infected computer
remotely.
Both executables were digitally signed with the same certiﬁcate:

2/15

The certiﬁcate details:
Company name: Blik
Validity: from 02 October 2014 to 03 October 2015
Thumbprint: 0d0971b6735265b28f39c1f015518768e375e2a3
Serial number: 00d95d2caa093bf43a029f7e2916eae7fb
Subject: CN = Blik
O = Blik
STREET = Berzarina, 7, 1
L = Moscow
S = Moscow
PostalCode = 123298
C = RU
This certiﬁcate was also used in the digital signature of a third malware family used by the
same gang: Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM.
Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM – overview
Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM (also known as Win32/Toshliph) is a trojan used as one of their
ﬁrst-stage payloads by the Carbanak gang. The binary of the testing version was signed
with a Blik certiﬁcate: moreover, Spy.Agent.ORM shares some similarities in the code
with “the regular” Carbanak malware.
3/15

The Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM malware family is already known in the industry because of
two blogposts. In July 2015 security company Cyphort reported the compromise of a
news portal and a banking site – rbc.ua and unicredit.ua. It turns out that the
compromised sites served Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM. After that, Blue Coat reported a
spearphishing attempt targeting Central Bank of Armenia employees, the payload being
the same.
This malware appeared on our radar at the beginning of summer 2015, and afterwards we
started to track it.
We have seen attempts to attack various companies in Russia and Ukraine using
spearphishing e-mails that have malicious attachments consisting of .SCR ﬁles or .RTF
exploits.
Here is an example of a spearphishing email sent to one of the biggest Forex-trading
companies:

Roughly translated from Russian to English, it says:
“Due to the high volatility of the ruble exchange rate the Bank of Russia sends rules of
trading on the currency market. Password the attached document: cbr”
4/15

Here is another example of a spear phishing attempt. Email with this text was sent to the
largest electronic payment service in Russia:
Постановлением Роскомнадзора от 04.08.2015г. Вам необходимо заблокировать
материалы попадающие под Федеральный закон от 27.07.2006 N 152-ФЗ (ред. от
21.07.2014) “О персональных данных”. Перечень материалов в документе.
Пароль roscomnadzor
Another rough translation from Russian to English:
“According to Roscomnadzor prescript you should block the materials, which you can ﬁnd
in the attachment. Password is roscomnadzor”
We have seen similar .SCR ﬁles with following ﬁlenames:
АО «АЛЬФА-БАНК» ДОГОВОР.scr (Alfabank contract)
Перечень материалов для блокировки от 04.08.2015г.scr (List to block)
Postanovlene_ob_ustranenii_18.08.2015.pdf %LOTS_OF_SPACES% ..scr
Правила Банка России от 06.08.2015.pdf %LOTS_OF_SPACES% .scr (Rules of
Bank of Russia)
All these attachments contained a password protected archive with .SCR ﬁle. The ﬁles
had Adobe Acrobat reader icon or MS Word icons.
In other cases attackers used RTF ﬁles with diﬀerent exploits, including an exploit for one
of the latest Microsoft Oﬃce vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-1770, which was patched by
Microsoft in June 2015 in MS15-059.
We have seen RTF ﬁles with the following names used in attacks:

Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM – Technical details
Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM is a small and simple backdoor that enables the attackers to
assess the victim. When executed the trojan connects to a C&C server and receives
commands to grab screenshots, enumerate running processes and get information about
the system and campaign ID. Based on that information malware operator decides
whether the infected computer is useful: that is, whether it’s the intended target or just a
system that was accidentally infected.
Here is list of commands that it can receive from C&C server:
Command

The latest sample of this malware family found in the wild is also digitally signed with a
diﬀerent certiﬁcate:

The certiﬁcate details:
Company name: In travel TOV
8/15

Validity: from 21 July 2015 to 21 July 2016
Thumbprint: 7809fbd8d24949124283b9ﬀ14d12da497d9c724
Serial number: 00dfd915e32c5f3181a0cdf0aﬀ50f8052
Subject: CN = In travel TOV
O = In travel TOV
STREET = prospekt Pravdi 33
L = Kiev
S = Kievskaja
PostalCode = 04108
C = UA
Also, the latest sample is able to gain system privileges via an exploit and install itself as a
system service. The trojan attempts to exploit a vulnerability – CVE-2015-2426 in the
OpenType manager module (ATMFD.dll) – which was patched by Microsoft in MS15-078.
The exploit for this vulnerability was leaked in a Hacking Team dump.

The digital certiﬁcate for Blik used in this case is not the only link between
Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM and Win32/Spy.Sekur (Carbanak malware). They share
similarities in code – take a look at the function that generates the BOTID-value, for
example:

9/15

The BOTID-value is a unique value generated on the basis of the hardware parameters of
infected computer, and it’s used by attackers for computer identiﬁcation. In both cases
generation is based on the MAC-address and computer name and the resulting value is
formatted using the wsprintf –function.

Sinkhole statistics
10/15

Our sinkhole of some C&C domains used by the Win32/Wemosis has resulted in hits from
bots in the following countries.

As the attacks are highly targeted, the total number of victims is low in absolute numbers.
Victims in the USA are situated in several states, including Nevada (Las Vegas),
California, and New York, and include casinos and hotels.

Conclusions
Even after it has reportedly stolen hundreds of millions of dollars, the infamous Carbanak
APT group isn’t resting on its laurels. On the contrary, it is very active and keeps attacking
speciﬁc targets related to the ﬁnance industry, including banks, Forex-trading companies,
and even an American casino hotel. Recently, we have detected malware used by the
Carbanak group in the following countries, among others:
United States of America
Germany
United Arab Emirates
11/15

As described in this blog post, the gang doesn’t use just one malware family to carry out
its operations but several. While the code in the diﬀerent families – Carbanak
(Win32/Spy.Sekur), Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM, and Win32/Wemosis – is diﬀerent it does
contain similar traits, including the same digital certiﬁcate.
Furthermore, the attackers are updating their arsenal with the latest exploits, such as the
Microsoft Oﬃce remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2015-1770, or the zero-day
exploit leaked in the Hacking Team dumps, CVE-2015-2426.
We continue to monitor the Carbanak threats. For any enquiries or sample submissions
related to the subject, contact as at: threatintel@eset.com.
