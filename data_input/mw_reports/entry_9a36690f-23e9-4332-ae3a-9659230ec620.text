17/32

A-3. Security consulting offered by Suncrypt
1. Defend your credentials from mimikatz
Limit administrator privileges to the smallest group possible
Even if you have thousands of user accounts, you should probably only have 2–5 administrator accounts
Start with two accounts and force users to justify any additional accounts added to the administrator group
upgrade the schema and functional level of your forest and domain to at least 2012 R2
**This domain functional level adds a fairly new group called “Protected Users”. Along with other protections, the members
of the Protected Users group cannot authenticate by using NTLM, Digest Authentication, or CredSSP. These changes
provide powerful protections that make Mimikatz almost worthless.
2. Verify KB2871997 has been installed to apply additional required security.
After you install this security update, the default setting for non-protected users on Windows 7 and Windows 8 is to not
force clear leaked logon session credentials
To override this default you can add the following registry dword, , and set it to a recommended value of 30 seconds
**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\TokenLeakDetectDelaySecs
Stop storing passwords in memory by changing the “UseLogonCredential” registry setting to ‘0’ instead of the default
value of “1” and passwords are no longer available to Mimikatz
**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest

18/32

UseLogonCredential 0 : not store credentials in memory
UseLogonCredential 1 : store credentials in memory
3. Start monitoring your systems for unauthorized software and malware, which should help identify Mimikatz installation
and activity
4. In your specific case the critical vulnerabiliry contained Forti VPN, please update FortiVpn and monitor for updates and
Windows updates
5. Inform your IT stuff to remove the posibility of storing user passwords within the network
6. Also we recommend you to use SentinelAV and dattoo backup system. Also Veeam Tapes is good ,but pc with veeam
should be in WORKGROUP and user should be different from main domain
7. Every PC should have AV. Don’t let any pc without AV
8. Also try configure 2FA (at all network pc) when you connect to remote desktop
9. Use password on AV
10. Also tip for you: If you want chage Fortigate VPN to other . We dont reccomend you to use Sonic VPN,Pulse Secure,
because its under massive hack

A-3. Transaction analysis
Bitcoin transaction analysis paid by victim
Payment date : 2021–06–15 05:46
Amounts : 7.044 BTC

19/32

Bitcoin transaction analysis via Xarvis
6.1951973 BTC amount, which is about 88%, finally flows to the following two addresses, and money laundering is
performed through coin mixing
Address : 1CWnkH6kmZMUPsMCe8PN77Ndo2ASHhA8Sg
Amounts : 4.9340973 BTC
Transactions time : 2021–06–16 07:40
Address : 1GykxLzh7Eftbyd7ABW1D74tGFUziLyqxK
Amounts : 1.2611 BTC
Transactions time : 2021–06–25 09:41

20/32

If you look at the amount divided by performing Coin mixing, it is distributed in exactly the same amount.
In particular, the pattern in which the same amount is divided by a combination of 0.001 BTC, 0.002 BTC, and 0.004
BTC is a typical feature of mixing performed by ChipMixer, and it is suspected that coin laundering was attempted
using ChipMixer.
Currently, there are addresses that have some remaining amount excluding them, and it seems that monitoring is
needed for transactions in this addresses.
Address : bc1qapaljnz2zxfmpfgz9kq2prswsuxhe54l2k9u7y
Amounts : 0.7048 BTC

C-1. The post of selling FortiNet VPN
REvil ransomware has posted a purchase article on an underground forum to purchase VPN-related access information,
and there is a possibility that ransomware groups may use VPN-related access information purchased through DDW in a
ransomware attack
Currently, the RAMP forum is operated for the purpose of promoting affiliate programs and sales services related to
ransomware RaaS, so the credential information posted on the forum is highly likely to be misused by ransomware
groups
According to a post posted on July 15, 2021, a user has announced that Fortinet VPN access information will be
posted

Conclusion
As the Suncrypt ransomware victim paid a high cost, it is necessary to review and apply the security consulting
content that could be obtained as a post-service service to other companies.
As the number of active users in the RAMP forum increases, continuous monitoring of users and posts is necessary.
