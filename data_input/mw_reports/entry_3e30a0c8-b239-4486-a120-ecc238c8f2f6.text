Last summer, a wave of sextortion emails began flooding inboxes around the world. The
spammers behind this scheme claimed they’d hacked your computer and recorded videos of
you watching porn, and promised to release the embarrassing footage to all your contacts
unless a bitcoin demand was paid. Now, French authorities say they’ve charged two men
they believe are responsible for masterminding this scam. One of them is a 21-year-old
hacker interviewed by KrebsOnSecurity in 2017 who openly admitted to authoring a banking
trojan called “Nuclear Bot.”
The author of a banking Trojan called Nuclear Bot — a teenager living in France — recently
released the source code for his creation just months after the malware began showing up
for sale in cybercrime forums. Now the young man’s father is trying to convince him not to act
on a job offer in the United States, fearing it may be a trap set by law enforcement agents.
