Update 16 - 03/12/2021 - 0458 ET
On Thursday afternoon (March 11th), security researcher Michael Gillespie reported ID
Ransomware received a sudden increase in ransomware notices coming from IPs belonging
to Microsoft Exchange servers. The encrypted files can be identified by their .CRYPT file
extension and the file marker DEARCRY! (screenshot of the magic bytes). The ransom
notice is named readme.txt and includes the following contact emails:
konedieyp@airmail[.]cc
uenwonken@memail[.]com

Microsoft has since confirmed this new family of ransomware is being used after the initial
compromise of unpatched on-premises Exchange Servers. Microsoft Defender has received
updates to detect this and may also be discoverable by the creation of a Service named
msupdate according to James Quinn.

Update 15 - 03/11/2021 - 1504 ET
We are observing an uptick in post-exploitation activity. Many of these TTPs were previously
disclosed in our March 9th Tradecraft Tuesday but the relevant slides can be found here:
Opera Browser DLL Sideloading Services
Cobalt Strike Loading from VSPerfMon Scheduled Tasks
Sapphire Pigeon Activity Leading to Mimikatz
PowerShell Based Lateral Movement Over SMB
With that said, there are some amazing blogs which highlight additional TTPs. We strongly
suggest reading these resources:

Update 14 - 03/11/2021 - 1413 ET
The last three days have been packed with mass analyzing verified intrusions of our
partners. With this data, we've shared specific threat actor IOCs (not client data) with
relevant Law Enforcement, CERTs, and national security organizations. For public
organizations looking to do their own logging/monitoring/blocking/response, we feel
comfortable sharing these observed exploit sources under TLP:WHITE. Huntress has direct
evidence these IP addresses were used for exploitation and webshell interaction:

Update 13 - 03/08/2021 - 1610 ET
If interested, tomorrow on Tradecraft Tuesday (March 9 at 1300 ET) we will be covering the
post-exploitation techniques we have observed. Everything from the web shells to the
malware dropped.___
Update 12 - 03/06/2021 - 0632 ET
Yesterday we started seeing multiple partners' on-prem Exchange servers receive malicious
scheduled tasks that executed a PowerShell downloader from
hxxp://p.estonine[.]com/p?e . This server was hosted on Digital Ocean and resolved to
IP address 188.166.162[.]201 and delivered a base64 encoded/compressed PowerShell
3/5

script. Oddly enough, this PowerShell looked very similar to a previous coin miner campaign
reported by Carbon Black in 2019. After reporting the incident to Digital Ocean (hosting) and
NameCheap (registrar), we started digging into Layer 4 of the delivered payload. After
deobfucating this (which produced Layer 5) we learned there were two Mimikatz DLLs (x86
and x64) embedded within the script which gets reflectively loaded/injected.

Stay vigilant because it looks like things may start to heat up

Update 11 - 03/05/2021 - 2319 ET
Brian Krebs' fantastic reporting estimates 30,000+ unique US organizations have been
compromised. Many researchers beyond the Huntress team are scratching their heads on
why did this incident escalated from the "limited and targeted" attacks observed by Volexity
on Jan 6th, 2021 to this worldwide incident. Notable commenters include former CISA
Director Chris Krebs and Microsoft's Hafnium blog has been updated with additional
resources to aid those performing investigations.
Also of note is Microsoft has updated their CSS Exchange repo on Github with their own
Nmap NSE to "detect whether the specified URL is vulnerable to the Exchange Server SSRF
Vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855)." Folks have reported improved accuracy but warned a bug
in Nmap could cause false inaccessibility errors. This is reportedly fixable by adding --minrtt-timeout 3 to Nmap's parameters. We recommend using this Microsoft version going
forward to assist validating your patch status and will provide feedback if we discover better
alternatives.

Update 10 - 03/05/2021 - 1704 ET
Just a quick update to our 1254 ET post.
We've confirmed the Nmap NSE script will display "potentially vulnerable" for both fully
patched server AND servers with only the most recent CU level (which is still vulnerable).
The script scrapes the OWA page to determine the version of Exchange. The OWA page
only includes the version number as major.minor.X but you need major.minor.X.Y to
confirm the fully patched version.
That said, the script is useful for finding unpatched versions quickly. Just be aware you need
to verify the complete patch level for servers that have the most recent CU applied.

4/5

Also, the various Exchange registry keys, such as ClientAccessRole, are not completely
reliable for patch verification. Here only the latest CU level version is reported, but patches to
a CU do not appear to update the version number stored in the registry.

Update 9 - 03/05/2021 - 1254 ET
Tons of folks couldn't join the webinar yesterday so we want to more useful points:
The internet is now mass scanning for these webshells
Microsoft published a script to assist the detection of malicious Exchange activity
The Nmap NSE to find vulnerable exchange boxes is not perfect (more on this shortly)
Using the registry's exchange build data is not perfect (more on this shortly)
More community resources are starting to pour in, so we'd like to highlight them:
NinjaRMM created great collection vendor knowledge. Check it out!
Shodan has added some detection capabilities. Unsure if it has the same accuracy
issues as the Nmap NSE released earlier this week.

Just finished the webinar and our team is in the process of sending the slides and
recordings. In case you didn't make it, here's some of the most useful data
