A new spear phishing campaign is taking place in Russia targeting dissenters with opposing
views to those promoted by the state and national media about the war against Ukraine.
The campaign targets government employees and public servants with emails warning of the
software tools and online platforms that are forbidden in the country.
The messages come with a malicious attachment or link embedded in the body that is
dropping a Cobalt Strike beacon to the recipient's system, enabling remote operators to
conduct espionage on the target.
The campaign's discovery and subsequent reporting come from threat analysts at
Malwarebytes Labs, who have managed to sample several of the bait emails.

Multiple phishing pathways
The phishing emails pretend to be from a Russian state entity, a ministry, or a federal
service, to entice recipients to open the attachment.
The "Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications of the Russian Federation"
and the "Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and mass communications" are
the primary two spoofed entities.
The threat actors use three different file types to infect their targets with Cobalt Strike,
namely RTF (rich text format) files, archive attachments of documents laced with malicious
documents, and download links embedded in the email body.
The case of the RTFs is the most interesting due to involving the exploitation of CVE-202140444, a remote code execution flaw in the rendering engine used by Microsoft Office
documents.

As is to be expected, all of the phishing emails are written in Russian, and they seem to have
been crafted by native speakers of the language and not machine translated, suggesting that
the campaign is endeavor from a Russian-speaking actor.
Apart from Cobalt Strike, Malwarebytes also noticed parallel attempts to deploy a heavily
obfuscated PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) with next-stage payload fetching
capabilities.

Crackdown on dissidents
The targets of this campaign work mainly in the Russian government and public agencies,
including the following entities:
Portal of authorities of the Chuvash Republic Official Internet portal
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs
ministry of education and science of the Republic of Altai
Ministry of Education of the Stavropol Territory
Minister of Education and Science of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania
Government of Astrakhan region
Ministry of Education of the Irkutsk region
Portal of the state and municipal service Moscow region
Ministry of science and higher education of the Russian Federation
The above organizations indicate that the phishing actors target individuals who hold key
positions and could cause problems to the central government by instigating war-opposing
movements.

The so-called "special operation" in Ukraine hasn't unfolded the way Kremlin had envisioned,
and western sanctions manifested on a scale way beyond what was accounted for, so this
campaign may be the result of the higher government ramping up its alertness
against potential coups.
This is a very likely explanation of why Russia-based hackers are interested in conducting
espionage against semi-high ranking government officials and ministry employees, but at this
time, it's just an assumption.
Malwarebytes has mapped the infrastructure used by the threat actor(s) behind the latest
campaign and will continue to monitor the associated activity.
