During 2018, iDefense observed several events likely attributed to the POND LOACH (aka
APT32 and OceanLotus) threat group, an adversary that has likely been active since 2013.
This group is allegedly behind an intrusion event into at least one organization operating in
the hospitality sector in 2018, according to recent reporting by security researchers at
CrowdStrike.1
About POND LOACH

iDefense has moderate confidence that POND LOACH has been operating in or near
Vietnam and is possibly supported by the Vietnamese government. This assessment is
based upon open- and closed-source information pertaining to prior targeting of foreign
governments, journalists, dissidents and private sector organizations operating across
numerous industries with significant business interests in Vietnam, with these entities
including countries in Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Laos and Cambodia (e.g.
Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]).

1/5

POND LOACH appears to be well funded, as evidenced by its developed variety of custom
backdoors to target Windows and Mac operating systems, as previously noted by security
researchers at Palo Alto Networks2 and ESET.3 One of these custom backdoors that
iDefense has continued to track is known as BadCake. This backdoor is commonly dropped
by either an SFX or an exploit document (e.g. Microsoft Corp. Word or PDF file).
Some of this backdoor’s observed capabilities include:
Arbitrary file, process and registration creation
Fingerprinting the local machine
Running arbitrary shellcode
Once dropped, it is usually divided into multiple components in order to be side-loaded, in a
fashion similar to other remote access tools including PlugX4 and NetTraveler.5 Several
examples of BadCake abusing legitimate, signed executables to carry out DLL side-loading
techniques include the following:
Symantec file rastlsc.exe to import the rastls.dll malware file
McAfee file mcoemcpy.exe to import the McUtil.dll malware file
POND LOACH tactics and techniques

iDefense analysts have used the MITRE ATT&CK6 framework to map the observed POND
LOACH tactics and techniques shown below:
Initial Access
Drive-by Compromise: Watering hole attacks via use of malicious JavaScript to
profile websites
Spear Phishing Attachment: Spear phishing e-mails containing malicious
documents (RTF, Word, Excel) with embedded executable content
Valid Accounts: Use of legitimate local admin account credentials
Execution
PowerShell: Use of PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders for execution
Regsvr32: Creates a scheduled task that uses regsvr32.exe to execute a COM
scriptlet that dynamically downloads a backdoor and injects it into memory
Scheduled Task: Use of scheduled tasks to persist on victim systems, including
BadCake creating a scheduled task to execute the executable that sideloads the
DLL at a set time or interval each day.
Signed Script Proxy Execution: Use of PubPrn.vbs within execution scripts to
execute malware, possibly bypassing defenses
User Execution: Attempts to lure users to execute a malicious dropper contained
within spear-phishing attachments
Persistence
New Service: Creates a Windows service to establish persistence
Web Shell: Use of Web shells to maintain access to victim websites
2/5

Privilege Escalation
Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: Use of CVE-2016-7255 vulnerability to
escalate privileges
Defense Evasion
Binary Padding: Inclusion of garbage code to mislead anti-malware software
and researchers
DLL Side-Loading: Use of genuinely signed executables from Symantec
Corporation and McAfee, LLC to load malicious DLL files, such as with BadCake,
when the Symantec executable (rastlsc.exe) is used to load a malicious DLL file
(rastls.dll) from the same directory
Indicator Removal on Host: Clears select event log entries
Masquerading: Use of hidden or non-printing characters to help masquerade
filenames on a system, such as appending a Unicode no-break space character
to a legitimate service name
Obfuscated Files or Information: Use of Invoke-Obfuscation framework to
obfuscate actor’s PowerShell; also performs other forms of code obfuscation
Timestomp: Use of a scheduled task named “Scheduled Defrags” with a
backdated task creation timestamp of June 2, 2016
Credential Access
Credential Dumping: Use of Mimikatz to dump stolen system and user
credentials
Discovery
System Information Discovery: Collects the victim operating system version
and computer name
System Owner/User Discovery: Collects the victim's username
Lateral Movement
Application Deployment Software: Compromises McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator
(ePO) to move laterally by distributing malware as a software deployment task
Remote File Copy: Adds JavaScript to victim websites to download additional
frameworks that profile and compromise website visitors
Collection
Automated Collection: Ability to fingerprint the local machine
Exfiltration
Exfiltration over Command-and-Control (C2) Channel: Use of domain
generation algorithm (DGA) to create subdomains for C2 servers that are
hardcoded into the malware

3/5

C2
Commonly Used Port: Use of port 80 for C2 communications
Uncommonly Used Port: Use of port 25123 for C2 communications
Standard Application Layer Protocol: Use of HTTP protocol for C2
communications; use of JavaScript that communicates over HTTP or HTTPS to
attacker-controlled domains to download additional frameworks
Custom C2 Protocol: Use of a custom TCP protocol, with which the adversary is
able to filter who receives the real C2 address by ensuring each sample
generates a unique domain name system (DNS) request based on profile data
extracted from the host; use of Cobalt Strike malleable C2 functionality to blend in
with network traffic
Looking forward

In recent years, POND LOACH actors have continued to use TTPs such as strategic website
compromise (SWC) and spear-phishing attacks to deliver custom website profiling tools and
malware backdoors. The likely objective for this group appears to be infiltrating the digital
assets of foreign public- and private-sector organizations with significant interests in Vietnam
to steal intellectual property and confidential business information that may benefit
Vietnamese state entities. iDefense analysts believe that this group will continue to be active
into next year and that it will re-tool its arsenal as needed to avoid network defense
mechanisms.
