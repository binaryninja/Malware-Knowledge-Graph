Technical links between the REvil and GandCrab ransomware families prove that the
GandCrab malware authors did not retire in June 2019 as they claimed. Tuesday, September
24, 2019 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
On May 31, 2019, the developers of the highly profitable GandCrab 'ransomware-as-aservice' announced that they were retiring after earning over $2 billion USD since January
2018. The news was met with interest and skepticism within the security community, as
1/9

multiple affiliate groups regularly conducted extremely successful GandCrab campaigns
since its inception. After analyzing the threat landscape, Secureworks® Counter Threat
Unit™ (CTU) researchers determined that some or all of GandCrab's developers, which the
CTU™ research team refers to as GOLD GARDEN, simply shifted their focus to a different
ransomware variant.

Enter REvil
The REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) ransomware was first spotted in the wild (ITW) on April
17, when threat actors leveraged an Oracle WebLogic exploit to deliver both REvil and
GandCrab. CTU analysis and tracking of REvil samples suggest that the ransomware was in
development and testing between April 10 and May 7 and was not intended for public
release.
Following the release of version 1.01 on May 7, the REvil developers, which CTU
researchers refer to as GOLD SOUTHFIELD, began pushing a new release of the
ransomware at the beginning of each month. The features and modifications of each version
are listed in the Appendix of this blog post. As of this publication, August is the only skipped
month. This cadence and the ransomware's capabilities indicate a structured development
process by dedicated and experienced malware authors.
After GOLD GARDEN's retirement announcement, REvil activity increased with expanded
delivery methods such as malicious spam campaigns and RDP attacks. This surge suggests
that the ransomware operators deemed it ready for public release. On June 20, REvil was
leveraged in a strategic web compromise (SWC) against the Italian WinRAR . it website,
replacing the WinRAR installation executable with an instance of the malware to infect
customers' systems. On the same day, threat actors breached at least three managed
service providers (MSPs) and used the access to deploy REvil to the MSPs' customers.
Other high-profile supply-chain attacks involving REvil have impacted 22 Texas
municipalities and hundreds of dentist offices in the United States. Figure 1 shows a timeline
of REvil releases and malicious activity.

Connecting the dots
Numerous characteristics indicate that the same developers were involved in producing
GandCrab and REvil, suggesting a connection between members of the GOLD GARDEN
and GOLD SOUTHFIELD threat groups. In a technical analysis of REvil version 1.01, CTU
researchers identified possible overlap between REvil and GandCrab. Even the earliest
identified REvil sample (REvil Beta) included elements that appear to refer to GandCrab.

Nearly identical string decoding function
CTU researchers found that the string decoding functions employed by REvil and GandCrab
are nearly identical. Because malware authors typically implement custom
encoding/decoding logic in their malware, the code can be used as a fingerprint to identify
other samples associated with the malware family. When analyzing REvil, CTU researchers
identified and extracted a portion of the opcodes (outlined in red in Figure 2) associated with
its string decoding function.

When searching VirusTotal for samples containing this opcode pattern, 286 unique samples
were identified. Further analysis of all 286 samples were confirmed to be either GandCrab or
REvil (including REvil's decryptor). CTU researchers have not identified other malware
families using this opcode pattern as of this publication, supporting the theory that these
malware families share code.

Similar URL building logic
REvil 1.00 implements URL building functionality that produces the same command and
control (C2) URL pattern as GandCrab. The C2 URLs for both families consist of two URI
subpaths followed by a randomly generated resource name and an extension (see Figure 3).
The subpath names and extension are retrieved from the hard-coded values listed in Table 1.

While technically it would be possible for an unaffiliated threat actor to reproduce this logic
within a separate malware family, doing so with such accuracy would require the threat actor
to reverse engineer a GandCrab sample. Given the level of effort requires and the
insignificant nature of the URI pattern, it is more likely that code originally created for
GandCrab was repurposed in REvil.

Hints at GandCrab version 6
CTU analysis of the REvil Beta sample revealed two findings that are significant in proving a
link between GandCrab and this first-identified version of REvil:
gcfin and gc6 debug paths — A debug path is typically created by the integrated
development environment (IDE) used by the malware author. Competent malware
authors remove this information prior to distribution, as it could reveal the malware's
name or details about the malware author's environment. The REvil Beta sample
includes the d:\code\csrc\!1\new_a\gcfin\bin\debug\rwenc_exe_x86_debug.pdb debug
path. gcfin is the malware author's name for the development project, and in context
with other evidence appears to refer to “GandCrab Final”. Similarly, a discovered REvil
file decryptor executable specifies the D:\\gc6\\core\\src\\common\\debug.c debug path.
The reference to gc6 in the debug path could be a reference to GandCrab 6, which
suggests that REvil was originally intended as GandCrab version 6.
REvil version 6.00? — REvil populates a stat JSON data structure with information
about the malware and the compromised host. Starting with REvil 1.00, the stat JSON
is encrypted and sent to the attacker's C2 server. CTU researchers determined that the
integer value assigned to the ver key located within the stat JSON represents the
malware version. REvil interprets the value as hexadecimal. The REvil Beta sample
includes the hard-coded value 1536, which converts to hexadecimal is 0x600 and
indicates version 6.00. This version does not align with REvil's incremental numbering
pattern as the next release is version 1.00, but it would align with the GandCrab
numbering pattern given that the last observed version of GandCrab was 5.2.

Region whitelisting
Both REvil and GandCrab whitelist similar keyboard locales to prevent infection of Russiabased hosts. Malware authors commonly whitelist regions where they reside to prevent
scrutiny from local law enforcement. This similarity does not establish a direct connection
between REvil and GandCrab but does indicate that the malware authors likely reside in the
same region.

5/9

Conclusion
GandCrab's 'ransomware-as-a-service model' proved to be a highly lucrative endeavor for
GOLD GARDEN, so it is unlikely that the threat actors abandoned all malicious activity.
Characteristics of REvil that appear to be operational security mistakes by the malware
authors enabled CTU researchers to technically link the REvil and GandCrab ransomware
families. This link indicates that the malware authors have shifted their focus from GandCrab
to REvil.
