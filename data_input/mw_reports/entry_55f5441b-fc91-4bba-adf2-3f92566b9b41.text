Dragonﬂy 2.0? Delta Elektroniks and Pre-embedded Malware

Delta Elektroniks highly likely supported by the Russian government and a direct
threat to energy sector supply chain operations
Treadstone 71 asserts with high conﬁdence that Delta Elektroniks (DE) is likely a front company directly associated with Energetic
Bear (Dragonﬂy), and the equipment purchased from DE is vulnerable to supply chain threats due to malware embedded in the
Taiwanese Delta Electronics (T-DE) programmable logic controller (PLC) software. T-DE is not aware of the infections allowing
customers to download and install infected PLC software for the initial purposes of cyber espionage. Long term intentions include
possible physical sabotage operations. The PLCs appear to be genuine production parts with malware introduced post
production. Veriﬁcation of Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov’s identity is incomplete; the name is likely ﬁctitious and probably statesponsored. Evidence that suggests this outcome:
Malware Targets SCADA Devices
TTPs are like Dragonﬂy or Energetic Bear (B2)
Targeting SCADA devices is consistent with espionage practices (B2)
Provides hackers a foothold into US critical infrastructure Delta Website in Taiwan
A copycat website in Russia is suspicious and consistent with masquerade techniques (C3)
A legitimate Russian business would not conduct themselves in such a way (C2)
Multiple other sites deliver the same software (C3) …
