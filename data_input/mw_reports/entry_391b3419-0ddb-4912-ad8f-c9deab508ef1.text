Tools and infrastructure used in the WannaCry ransomware attacks have strong links to Lazarus, the group that was responsible for the
destructive attacks on Sony Pictures and the theft of US$81 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank. Despite the links to Lazarus, the
WannaCry attacks do not bear the hallmarks of a nation-state campaign but are more typical of a cybercrime campaign. Our analysis only
allows us to attribute these attacks to the Lazarus group. The technical details do not enable us to attribute the motivations of the attacks to a
specific nation state or individuals.
Prior to the global outbreak on May 12, an earlier version of WannaCry (Ransom.Wannacry) was used in a small number of targeted attacks
in February, March, and April. This earlier version was almost identical to the version used in May 2017, with the only difference the method of
propagation. Analysis of these early WannaCry attacks by Symantec’s Security Response team revealed substantial commonalities in the
tools, techniques, and infrastructure used by the attackers and those seen in previous Lazarus attacks, making it highly likely that Lazarus
was behind the spread of WannaCry. These earlier versions of WannaCry used stolen credentials to spread across infected networks, rather
than leveraging the leaked Eternal Blue exploit that caused WannaCry to spread quickly across the globe starting on May 12.

Summary of links
Following the first WannaCry attack in February, three pieces of malware linked to Lazarus were discovered on the victim’s network:
Trojan.Volgmer and two variants of Backdoor.Destover, the disk-wiping tool used in the Sony Pictures attacks.
Trojan.Alphanc, which was used to spread WannaCry in the March and April attacks, is a modified version of Backdoor.Duuzer, which
has previously been linked to Lazarus.
Trojan.Bravonc used the same IP addresses for command and control as Backdoor.Duuzer and Backdoor.Destover, both of which have
been linked to Lazarus.
Backdoor.Bravonc has similar code obfuscation as WannaCry and Infostealer.Fakepude (which has been linked to Lazarus).
There is shared code between WannaCry and Backdoor.Contopee, which has previously been linked to Lazarus.

February attack
The first evidence Symantec has seen of WannaCry being used in the wild was February 10, 2017, when a single organization was
compromised. Within two minutes of the initial infection, more than 100 computers in the organization were infected.
The attackers left behind several tools on the victim’s network that provided substantial evidence into how WannaCry spread. Two files,
mks.exe and hptasks.exe (see Appendix C: Indicators of Compromise), were found on one affected computer. The file mks.exe is a variant of
Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz), a password-dumping tool that is widely used in targeted attacks. The latter file, hptasks.exe, was used to then
copy and execute WannaCry on other network computers using the passwords stolen by mks.exe.
The spread of WannaCry by hptasks.exe was a two-stage process. In stage one, when run, hptasks can be passed a target list of IP
addresses as an argument. When given this command, hptasks reads previously stolen credentials from a file called cg.wry and uses them to
connect to every computer in the set of IP address ranges. All connection attempts are logged into the log.dat file. If a successful connection
is made to a remote computer, and there is no file with a .res extension in either the Admin$, or C$\Windows folders, then hptasks.exe will
copy the files listed in Table 2 onto the remote computer.

Table 1. Files copied by hptasks.exe onto target computers
After hptasks.exe executes WannaCry on the remote computer, the second stage begins. hptasks can pass several arguments to the
WannaCry installation on the remote computer, including a new set of IP addresses. If WannaCry is run with these IP addresses as
arguments, it does not encrypt the files on the local computer. Instead, it connects to the IP addresses passed, accesses the Admin$ and C$
share on those computers using the credentials embedded in the resource section in a file called c.wry, and then remotely encrypts those
files.
In addition to hptasks.exe and mks.exe, five other pieces of malware were discovered on a second computer on the victim’s network. Three
of these tools are linked to Lazarus. Two were variants of Destover (Backdoor.Destover) a tool used in the Sony Pictures attacks. The third
was Trojan.Volgmer, malware that has previously been used by Lazarus in attacks against South Korean targets.

March and April attacks
Beginning on March 27, at least five organizations were infected with a new sample of WannaCry. There does not appear to have been a
pattern to those targeted, with the organizations spanning a range of sectors and geographies. These attacks revealed further evidence of
links between those behind WannaCry and the Lazarus Group.
Two different backdoors were used to deploy WannaCry in these attacks: Trojan.Alphanc and Trojan.Bravonc. Alphanc was used to drop
WannaCry onto computers belonging to at least two of the known victims, with a slightly modified version of the malware deployed to each
victim.
Alphanc shares a significant amount of code with Backdoor.Duuzer, a sub-family of the Destover wiping tool used in the Sony attacks (see
Appendix B: Shared Code). In fact, Symantec investigators believe Alphanc is an evolution of Duuzer. Duuzer has also previously been linked
to the activity of Backdoor.Joanap and Trojan.Volgmer, which have both been previously linked to Lazarus.
Symantec researchers were able to establish a detailed timeline of the activity of Alphanc on one of the victim’s systems, from the time it got
on the system to when WannaCry was deployed.

Timeline of Alphanc activity
Alphanc was deployed on the target computer as armsvc.exe and minutes later copied itself to a new name, javaupdate.exe. The sample
executed from this location:
cmd.exe /c "copy c:\Users\Administrator\AppData\armsvc.exe c:\windows\system32\javaupdate.exe >
C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK15DA.tmp" 2>&1
Minutes later, mks.exe, the same credential dumper used in the February WannaCry attacks, was created and executed. There was no
activity for three days, until the attackers returned and deployed a version of RAR and created a password-protected archive. Moments later a
network scanner called g.exe ran. This performed a DNS lookup for all IP addresses in the IP address range selected by the attackers,
probably to determine computers of interest. A two-day gap in activity followed before the attackers returned to profile the local network.
Examples of commands used include:
cmd.exe /c "net view > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK2301.tmp" 2>&1
cmd.exe /c "net view /domain > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK6C42.tmp" 2>&1
cmd.exe /c "time /t > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NKC74F.tmp" 2>&1
Then, the file taskhcst.exec was created by javaupdate.exe. This was the WannaCry ransomware. The .exec extension is renamed to .exe,
as illustrated blow. This was likely a safety check so that the attacker would not mistakenly execute the file prematurely.
cmd.exe /c "ren C:\Windows\taskhcst.exec taskhcst.exe > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK833D.tmp" 2>&1
Approximately 45 minutes later, the attacker copied the javaupdate.exe backdoor to a remote computer. A file called bcremote.exe was then
also copied to this computer; this was the same tool that was called hptasks.exe in the February attack, and was used to spread WannaCry
across the network. The configuration file for this file was then copied, and finally WannaCry itself was copied over:
cmd.exe /c "net use \\REDACTED\ipc$ REDACTED /u:REDACTED > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK2E.tmp" 2>&1
cmd.exe /c "copy c:\windows\system32\javaupdate.exe \\REDACTED\c$\windows\javaupdate.exe >
C:\Users\REDACTEDAppData\Local\Temp\NK3E49.tmp" 2>&1
cmd.exe /c "copy c:\windows\beremote.exe \\REDACTED\c$\windows\ > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK4DD5.tmp" 2>&1
cmd.exe /c "copy c:\windows\c.wry \\REDACTED\c$\windows\ > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK7228.tmp" 2>&1
cmd.exe /c "copy c:\windows\taskh*.exe \\REDACTED\c$\windows\ > C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\NK7DCF.tmp" 2>&1

2/8

The same process took place on a second server on the network, and when the bcremote.exe command was executed, WannaCry was
spread across the network.

Trojan.Bravonc
Fewer details are available about the operation of Trojan.Bravonc, but it was used to drop WannaCry onto the computers of at least two other
victims, and displays some fairly definitive links to the Lazarus group.
It connects to a command and control (C&C) server at the IP address 87.101.243.252, which is the same IP address used by a sample of
Destover, a known Lazarus tool. This IP address was also referenced in Blue Coat’s From Seoul To Sony report.
Duuzer has also been observed using this IP address as a C&C server. Bravonc and a variant of Destover also share cryptographic related
code (See Appendix B: Shared Code). In addition, Bravonc’s method of spreading (over SMB using hardcoded credentials), was the same
technique used by Joanap, another Lazarus-linked tool.

May attacks: WannaCry goes global
On May 12, a new version of WannaCry was released which incorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit that used two known vulnerabilities
in Windows (CVE-2017-0144 and CVE-2017-0145) to spread the ransomware to unpatched computers on the victim’s network and also to
other vulnerable computers connected to the internet.
The incorporation of EternalBlue transformed WannaCry from a dangerous threat that could only be used in a limited number of targeted
attacks to one of the most virulent strains of malware seen in recent years. It caused widespread disruption, both to organizations infected
and to organizations forced to take computers offline for software updates. The discovery and triggering of a kill switch by security blog
MalwareTech halted its spread and limited the damage.
The earlier versions of WannaCry and the one used in the May 12 attacks are largely the same, with some minor changes, chiefly the
incorporation of the EternalBlue exploit. The passwords used to encrypt the Zip files embedded in the WannaCry dropper are similar across
both versions ("wcry@123", "wcry@2016", and "WNcry@2ol7") indicating that the author of both versions is likely the same group.
The small number of Bitcoin wallets used by first version of WannaCry, and its limited spread, indicates that this was not a tool that was
shared across cyber crime groups. This provides further evidence that both versions of WannaCry were operated by a single group.

WannaCry links to Lazarus
Aside from commonalities in the tools used to spread WannaCry, there are also a number of links between WannaCry itself and Lazarus. The
ransomware shares some code with Backdoor.Contopee, malware that has previously been linked to Lazarus. One variant of Contopee uses
a custom SSL implementation, with an identical cipher suite, which is also used by WannaCry. The cipher suite in both samples has the same
set of 75 different ciphers to choose from (as opposed to OpenSSL where there are over 300).
In addition, WannaCry uses similar code obfuscation to Infostealer.Fakepude, malware that has previously been linked to Lazarus; and
Trojan.Alphanc, malware that was used to spread WannaCry in the March and April attacks and which has been linked to Lazarus (see
above).

Fortuitous leak turned WannaCry into global threat
The discovery of a small number of earlier WannaCry attacks has provided compelling evidence of a link to the Lazarus group. These earlier
attacks involved significant use of tools, code, and infrastructures previously associated with the Lazarus group, while the means of
propagation through backdoors and stolen credentials is consistent with earlier Lazarus attacks. The leak of the EternalBlue exploit was what
allowed the attackers to turn WannaCry into a far more potent threat than it would have been had they still been relying on their own tools,
since it bypassed many of the steps the attackers previously had to take, removing both the need to steal credentials and copy it from
computer to computer.
Thanks to Symantec’s Network Protection Research Labs for their contribution to this research.

Appendix A: WannaCry and Lazarus shared network infrastructure
There are a number of crossovers seen in the C&C servers used in the WannaCry campaigns and by other known Lazarus tools. For
example, during the attacks against Sony, a malware family called Backdoor.Destover was deployed. Later variants of Backdoor.Destover
were seen to use the IP address 87.101.243.252 for command and control. The Trojan.Bravonc sample discovered dropping WannaCry also
connects to this IP address. Other shared network infrastructure is listed below:

Appendix B: Shared Code
Shared network code between Trojan.Alphanc and Backdoor.Duuzer
Trojan.Alphanc and Backdoor.Duuzer use similar code to generate the buffer being sent out after connection to the C&C server is
established. This code is part of what could be referred to as a "Fake SSL" handshake. This is similar in concept to the code identified by
Google, but different in implementation. Both samples generate a random number, and use that number to lookup a table for additional data
to send. That table is identical across both samples. In addition, both samples will prepend the same value, 0x16030100, to the start of the
buffer sent to the C&C server.

Shared function identified by Neel Mehta
On May 15, Google researcher Neel Mehta tweeted the following:

7/8

The first hash, 9c7c7149387a1c79679a87dd1ba755bc, is a Ransom.WannaCry variant and ac21c8ad899727137c4b94458d7aa8d8 is a
variant of Backdoor.Contopee, a backdoor used in attacks against several banks. The samples referenced in the tweet contain shared code.
This shared code is part of a custom SSL implementation, using an identical cipher suite. It could be described as "fake ssl". Each cipher
specifies an option for key exchange, authentication, bulk encryption, MAC. The Contopee sample and WannaCry sample have almost
identical pieces of code that reference an identical cipher suite. The cipher suite in both samples has the same 75 different ciphers to choose
from (as opposed to OpenSSL where there are over 300).
