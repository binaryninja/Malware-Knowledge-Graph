A couple of months ago, as we rang in 2016, we thought it would be interesting to take a
quick look back at some OSX malware from 2015 and 2014. As reported by the team at
Bit9+Carbon Black [1], 2015 marked “the most prolific year in history for OS X malware”. We
collected a few samples of malware named in that report, along with some samples of other
notable OSX malware, with the intention of learning more about them and fill in any gaps in
our detection mechanisms (NIDS and Correlation rules). Although our primary objective was
to capture network traffic from the malware samples, we were also interested in other
aspects of the malware like persistence mechanisms (if any) that they utilized, so we
documented that activity as well.
To start off with, we reviewed Flashback, one of the most infamous pieces of OS X malware
that reminded everyone to the fact that OS X is not immune to malware. After that, we played
with KitM, which is spyware, and LaoShu, a RAT. Then we analyzed Mask, a sophisticated
malware that was used for cyber espionage. We also looked into CoinThief malware that
steals bitcoins from the infected machine and the WireLurker malware that is capable of
infecting iPhone devices connected to the compromised machine. Finally, we analyzed
OceanLotus that was discovered May last year and found to be attacking Chinese
government infrastructure. Below is a summary of our findings from analyzing the samples in
a sandbox – the findings include links to fully executable samples, IDS signatures,
persistence mechanisms and C&C details.

the address of CnC server.

Persistence Mechanisms
The samples we looked at used well known [2] persistence mechanisms and were not
difficult to detect. Specifically, the samples that we looked at use the following persistence
mechanisms: launch agents, launch daemons, login items, and browser extensions. For
those that aren't familiar with how these mechanisms are used, below is a short summary.
Launch daemons: These are start-up programs that run when the system first boots up.
Items in /Library/LaunchDaemons and /System/Library/LaunchDaemons load
when OSX starts up, and run as the root user.
Launch agents: These are start-up programs that are executed on a per-user basis.
Items in /Library/LaunchAgents and /System/Library/LaunchAgents load when any
user logs in, and run as that user.
5/7

Items in ~/Library/LaunchAgents load only when that particular user logs in, and run
as that user.
Login items
These programs are run at the end of the login process and can be found in
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist. The login items can be viewed in
System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> [User Name] -> Login Items
Browser extensions
These are plugins that are loaded when a user starts a web browser such as Safari, Chrome,
Firefox or Opera. These plugins are often used to monitor browser activity and steal sensitive
information such as login credentials. Although the samples we looked at used browser
extensions, malicious plugins are not limited to browsers – malicious plugins can be added to
a variety of applications that support plugins.

OTX Stats
In addition to gathering samples, we also took a look at some statistics from Open Threat
Exchange (OTX). The top 3 offenders that we saw in that data were:
1. OSX/Flashback User-Agent (49.5%)
2. OSX ADWARE/Mackeeper (26.6%)
3. OSX/WireLurker (23.7%)
This represents slightly over 20k events and includes only data prior to us enhancing our
detection capabilities, so it doesn't include hits for OceanLotus, LaoShu, CoinThief, or KitM.
The following pulses from Open Threat Exchange (OTX) are related to the samples we
examined:

Observations

6/7

We found this exercise to be quite useful as it allowed us to get better acquainted with the
behavior of the above malware and we were indeed able to improve our detection
capabilities. Part of the process was to obtain fully functional OSX malware samples, but we
found that can sometimes be difficult since many samples on VirusTotal are stand-alone
executables rather than full '.app' bundles. Hopefully, we have made it a little easier for you
to perform your own analysis by including links to fully executable samples.
Although this was an interesting exercise, we noted that most of the C&C servers have been
taken offline, so the risk associated with these samples is not high. However, any signs of
activity from these samples could be an indication of a deeper compromise so they should
not be summarily dismissed.

Looking Ahead
Apple is making strong inroads in the corporate space. Apple's rising market share is making
it lucrative for malware authors to write more OSX malware. In the Silicon Valley (where we
are headquartered), many startups offer Macbooks as the default laptop when onboarding
new hires. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that as the adoption of OSX increases,
so will the prevalence of OSX-based malware. Furthermore, 2015 has been a tremendous
year for OSX-based vulnerability disclosure [3]. As the number of known vulnerabilities
increase, we expect more malware will take advantage of those flaws.
