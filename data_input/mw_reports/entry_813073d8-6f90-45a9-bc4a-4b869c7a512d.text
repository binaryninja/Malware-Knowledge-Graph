New Stealer Rapidly Evolving into Clipper Malware
During a routine threat-hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a post on Telegram selling an
information stealer malware called “NoMercy stealer.” The malware developer is currently selling the
stealer for 780 Indian rupees or 10 USD, indicating that the stealer is developed primarily for Indian Threat
Actors (TA). The NoMercy stealer developer is also rapidly adding new capabilities.
The stealer is very primitive, and our observations indicate that it is at the initial stages of development.
The NoMercy stealer initially checks for the system’s public IP using hxxp://api.ipify[.]org.
After getting the public IP, the stealer registers itself with the Command-and-Control server (C&C). After
registration, the stealer sends various system information to the C&C server.
The stealer then proceeds to continuously send screenshots, keystrokes, webcam photos, and device
audio to the C&C server. The figure below shows the Telegram post made by the NoMercy developer.

The Threat Actors (TAs) behind this group are actively working on enhancing the capabilities of the stealer.
During the course of our analysis, we noticed that the TAs had added new features to this stealer, including
clipper and VPN client-stealer capabilities.
The TAs behind NoMercy are selling this new version of the stealer for 20$. The figure shows the post for
NoMercy stealer version v1.1.0.

The sha-256 of the information stealer is
9ecc76d4cda47a93681ddbb67b642c2e1f303ab834160ab94b79b47381e23a65.
This stealer is a 32-bit, console-based C# executable file. The file is a debug version of this stealer project.
Figure 3 shows the basic file information.

Figure 3 – Static File Information
The NoMercy stealer has a hardcoded configuration embedded into the source code. The configuration
contains the details such as C&C URL, file name for establishing persistence, version information, etc. The
figure below shows the configuration details.

After initial execution, the information stealer copies itself into the start-up folder of the user’s machine.
This results in the execution of the stealer at the time of the system restart.
The figure below shows the malicious file in the start-up folder named “WindowsKernalDrivers.exe.”

After establishing persistence, the stealer generates a unique UID using system artifacts such as the
victim’s public IP and account name. The stealer gets the public IP of the victim from hxxp://api.ipify[.]org
and appends the account name generated using the whoami command. The figure below shows the
method GenerateUID() used to get the UID.

Figure 6 – Function to Generate UID of the Victim System
After generating UID, the stealer registers itself to the C&C server using the UID and stealer’s version
information. The stealer then uses the format for its C&C communications using the method PostUID(). The
TA thus gains information about the victim’s public IP, user account, and stealer version in the below
format:
hxxp://six-clowns-sing-103-119-240-166.loca[.]lt/a?uid=[public IP]@[Current Username]&version=NoMercyv1.0

Figure 7 – Function to Register Victim to C&C
After sending the victim data to the C&C server, the stealer collects various system information data points
from the victim using cmd.exe. The information is extracted using various commands such as whoami, arp,
ipconfig, etc. The figure below shows all these commands being used by the stealer.

Figure 8 – System Information Collected using cmd.exe
After getting the internal system information, the stealer queries and extracts additional system information
from the infected system such as public IP, hardware ID, main memory, GPU, MAC address, private IP, OS
version, details of any antivirus software installed, keyboard language, clipboard, running processes and
CPU information.
The figure below shows the code used by the malware to collect additional system information.

Figure 9 – Other System Information Extracted by the NoMercy Stealer
After collecting the information, the stealer encodes the stolen data to a base64 string and sends the
information to the C&C server.The stealer calls the PostCLIInfoCNC() and PostOtherInfoCNC() methodsfor
sending the information to its C&C server, as shown below.

Figure 10 – Methods to Send Data to C&C Server
After sending all the victim’s information to its C&C server, the malware runs three separate threads for
different operations, which are:
1. Send screenshots
2. Send microphone audio
3. Send webcam snapshots

Figure 11 – NoMercy Stealer Execution
The malicious URL resolves to the IP address 193.34.76[.]44, which is highly active and hosts multiple
malicious files. We have observed strains of various information stealers connecting to this IP.

Conclusion
The NoMercy stealer is a very crude and simple information stealer in its initial stages. The TAs behind this
stealer are actively modifying the stealer and adding additional capabilities.
The active infections are not very high in volume but are a good indicator of the trends of the TAs involved.
One such emerging trend is adding clipper capabilities to the malware. Cyble Research Labs continuously
monitors all new and existing malware to keep our readers aware and informed.
