HermeticWiper and
PartyTicket Targeting
Computers in Ukraine

MALWARE/TOOL PROFILE

Background
HermeticWiper, also known as FoxBlade, is a data wiper found
targeting finance and government contractor organizations in
Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania, according to Symantec.
This report is a technical overview of the HermeticWiper and
PartyTicket malware reported by ESET and Symantec on February 23,
2022. The malware was primarily delivered to Ukrainian organizations
coincident with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is intended for those
looking for a high-level overview of the malware’s TTPs and mitigations.

ESET first reported that their telemetry indicated the
malware was delivered to hundreds of systems in Ukraine, and
the malware was executed on February 23, 2022, following DDoS
attacks on Ukrainian websites earlier that day.

differing significantly in form and function from known
criminal ransomware threats.

Key Judgments
• The use of a wiper malware with an associated
destructive ransomware component is similar
in method to WhisperGate, NotPetya, and other
operations credited to Sandworm.
• There is insufficient evidence at this time to
attribute HermeticWiper to the Russian state,
but the timing of the mass deployment of
HermeticWiper with kinetic attacks and other
cyberattacks on Ukraine, and a methodology
similar to past attacks by Russian governmentassociated actors, lends credence to such an
attribution.
• The PartyTicket ransomware attacks are unlikely
to be a true ransomware campaign conducted
for financial gain. It is more likely that the
ransomware component is a ruse and the real
purpose of the attacks are disruption and data
destruction.

WhisperGate attacks used a similar methodology, wherein
the attack was disguised as ransomware. Both WhisperGate
and HermeticWiper used separate components to prevent a
victim’s system from booting and file corruption; however, the
component that played the role of ransomware changed between
the 2 attacks. With WhisperGate, the wiper itself masqueraded
as ransomware; however, with the HermeticWiper attacks, it was
the file corrupter instead.
ESET reported that in one instance they observed, the
malware was dropped via default Group Policy Objects (GPO),
indicating that the adversaries almost certainly had control of
an Active Directory server on the network.

To create the service, the process’s token privileges are
adjusted again to add SeLoadDriverPrivilege. A service is then
created, configured, and started. Once the driver is successfully
loaded, the created service’s registry entry is removed from
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\. Next, the Volume
Shadow Service (VSS) is stopped and disabled, as shown in
Figure 4, to make recovery more difficult.
The wiper then begins to iterate through all physical
drives on the system one at a time by attempting to access
\\.\PhysicalDrive<1-100>. For each drive, junk data is written to
seemingly random locations of the disk in order to corrupt it.
Additionally, the partitions on each physical disk are enumerated
and any identified as FAT or NTFS file systems are corrupted by
writing random data to the file system header. Although public
reporting has stated that the MBR is “wiped”, which typically
means the MBR is overwritten, in our analysis we have concluded
that only the file system is corrupted along with random locations
on the disk. The end result similarly results in a loss of the stored
data and inability of the victim machine to boot. Appendix A
provides the output from a tool, API Monitor, that captured the
SetFilePointerEX and WriteFile API calls used to corrupt the hard
drives on the victim’s machine. There were no writes to the “0”
index, where the MBR would reside, however there are writes
to the index, 1048576, which is the location of the NTFS file
system header. The additional writes are to seemingly random
locations on disk.
The corruption of the file systems goes beyond a simple

There is no “branding” identifying a particular ransomware
group responsible for the attack, and there are several
misspellings and grammatical errors throughout the note. As
a result, the ransomware component of the HermeticWiper
malware is unlikely to have been developed and distributed by a
criminal ransomware group. Further, the malware contains a list
of files, shown in Figure 12 below, that it seeks to encrypt. Unlike
all other recent, criminal-operated ransomware variants, this list
includes files that are key to the ability of the victim system to
operate, including .dll and .exe files. This further suggests that
this is not legitimate ransomware but rather a destructive piece
of malware.

Endeavoring to prevent, detect and block early-stage activity
observed in the delivery of HermeticWiper, such as malicious
PowerShell usage and SMB exploitation, is thus recommended.
The adversary, nimble enough to exploit more than one type of
system to deliver HermeticWiper, is likely capable of delivering
malware to other vulnerable systems as well, and consistent
patching and updating of all external-facing systems is therefore
critical.
On February 26, 2022, CISA issued an alert concerning the
use of destructive malware, specifically HermeticWiper and
WhisperGate, against Ukrainian organizations. General best
practices and mitigations for wiper malware are provided in the
alert. By keeping updated on the current situation in Ukraine, in
particular in the cyber realm, an organization can better prioritize
patching and other mitigations based on what is currently known
of potential threats.

The table below shows the output from the tool API Monitor and was specifically capturing the API calls SetFilePointerEx,
WriteFile, and wnsprintfw. To get the drive index location that SetFilePointerEx is pointing to, you must combine the “HighPart”
