TRM Analysis Corroborates Suspected Ties Between Conti and Ryuk Ransomware
Groups and Wizard Spider
April 6, 2022

Key Findings
An analysis of leaked private messages of Conti group members, open-source reporting, and
on-chain investigations of salary-related addresses by TRM investigators indicates ties
between two ransomware groups, Conti and Ryuk. Both Conti and Ryuk also appear to be
part of the Wizard Spider cybercriminal group, and are responsible for the TrickBot botnet.
Not only do on-chain investigations indicate funds for salary paid by a Conti core
member were derived from a known Ryuk ransomware address, similarities in code
and other factors suggest that Conti is a rebranding of the Ryuk ransomware. Such a
tactic of rebranding is widely known to be used by ransomware syndicates to cover
their tracks as described by BleepingComputer.

On February 27, 2022, an individual with apparent inside access to Conti’s
infrastructure leaked nearly 160,000 messages from internal chats and other data
shedding light on more than a year of Conti’s operations, uncovering the syndicate’s
ecosystem as well as hundreds of crypto addresses used to extort victims and fund the
group's activities. Authentication of leaks as having come from Conti infrastructure was
confirmed by the threat intelligence community including TheRecord.
The leak was sparked by Conti’s official statement on February 25, 2022, announcing
full support to the Russian State and threatening the world with offensive operations if
any Russian infrastructure is attacked as a possible response to Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine.

Background
Ryuk ransomware, which was active from mid-to-late 2018, was responsible for a high
number of ransomware attacks resulting in millions of USD in losses. For several years, the
threat intelligence community has suspected that both Ryuk and Conti ransomware were
operated by a single group identified as Wizard Spider by CrowdStrike based on the
similarities in code and other factors.
After Ryuk’s suspected rebrand to Conti in approximately May of 2020, the ransomware
continued becoming even more destructive, eventually merging with the group running the
TrickBot botnet at the end of 2021 according to threat intelligence firm AdvIntel. TrickBot
initially emerged in 2016 as a banking Trojan designed to steal user credentials and
personally identifiable information (PII). The prolific botnet then expanded its capabilities to
credential harvesting, crypto mining, and gaining a foothold into the victims’ systems to
deploy ransomware.
TrickBot and Wizard Spider’s Ryuk business relationships first followed a BaaS (Botnet-as-aService) model and grew to a partnership after Ryuk’s rebranding to Conti. Working with
TrickBot, Conti quickly became one of the most profitable and prolific ransomware
syndicates. Threat researcher Jack Cable, who runs the crowdsourcing ransomware site
ransomwhe.re, estimated Conti as being the most profitable group through mid-2021.

Conti Supports Russia, Issues Threats
According to the chatter observed on top-tier dark-web forums, the Russian invasion of
Ukraine and the ongoing military conflict have split the Russian-speaking cybercriminal
community. In dark web chatter, many cybercriminals, including ransomware threat actors,
voiced support for a particular side, while others, like LockBit2.0, tried to maintain a level of
neutrality. On February 25, 2022, Conti openly voiced its support for the Russian State and
posted a threat to the “Western world” on its official extortion site, stating it would strike back
with offensive operations if any of the Russian infrastructures is attacked.

Shortly after Conti’s official statement, on February 27, 2022, an individual with apparent
inside access to Conti’s infrastructure leaked purported internal chat logs consisting of nearly
160,000 messages via Twitter, shedding light on more than a year of Conti’s operations. The
individual who leaked the chats claimed in online tweets to be doing so in retaliation for
Conti’s support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leak also included hundreds of
3/10

crypto addresses, which appear to have been used in the group’s illicit activity to extort
victims and pay for services such as the salaries of the group’s members. Authentication of
leaks as having come from Conti infrastructure was confirmed by the threat intelligence
community including TheRecord.

Connecting Wizard Spider, Conti, and Ryuk
An analysis of the Conti leaks, specifically information within the leaked messages related to
salary payments, as well as the on-chain flow of funds revealed unique insights into the
operation of Wizard Spider. TRM analysts found that, unlike most ransomware syndicates,
Conti implements a model of wage-based employees in addition to the percentage-based
affiliate model used by traditional RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) groups.
TRM on-chain analysis corroborated payments discussed on July 14, 2020; the chats show
actors “Salamandra”, the threat actor in charge of Conti’s HR, and “Stern”, a senior Wizard
Spider team member, discussing a potential candidate for hire, called "bonen". bonen, a
coder with 20 years of experience was hired with a salary of 150,000 Rubles per month
(approximately $2,112 USD at the time). In addition, bonen was paid 15,000 Rubles
(approximately $207 USD) for completing a test assignment. This transaction was also
confirmed by TRM on-chain analysis.
The on-chain investigation also confirmed a transfer of $85,000 USD from Stern to a team
lead on one of the Conti teams operating under the alias “Mango.” The transfer was made to
pay for the salary of Mango’s team. Mango requested the transfer from Stern on July 19,
2021, according to the leaks, so that the funds could then be split across the team of nearly
100 people consisting of pentesters, coders, OSINT investigators, and reverse engineers.
Some of the funds were also set aside for payments for servers and test assignments for
new hires according to the chats between Stern and Mango.

Further investigation identified that the funds for the aforementioned payment from Stern to
Mango were derived from a known Ryuk ransomware address reported by CrowdStrike in
January of 2019. This financial transaction appears to confirm the long-suspected ties
between Ryuk and Conti and underscores the widely adopted tactics of rebranding by
ransomware syndicates to cover their tracks, described by BleepingComputer. However,
despite the rebranding, the cryptocurrency financial transactions carried out by the groups
leave a trail, which can be uncovered, as TRM shows.

The chats further revealed that Wizard Spider is also working on putting together a team that
will attempt to develop an internal Blockchain platform and its own token to circumvent
cryptocurrency tracking by law enforcement and researchers.

“We want to create our own cryptosystem such as etherium, polkadot, and binance smart
chain,” Stern said to their team members on June 28, 2021. “We need to study the
principles, code, and other things to be able to build on. And then, we will be able to integrate
NFT, DEFI, DEX, and all the existing and upcoming trends,” they added.
“Do we think that any of us are gurus of Blockchain and trends? Anyone has any idea the
direction we can take to develop it?”, Stern continued on July 8, 2021. Stern’s crypto
aspirations were met with less enthusiasm from other threat actors such as Mango: “This is a
great idea, but very complicated at the same time. Let’s be realistic, we can’t handle it on our
own with so little experience and resources.”
Despite the fact that the Blockchain project still has not been developed, the threat actors’
interest in expanding into the cryptocurrency and the Defi space does raise significant
concern. Based on the chats, the overall goal for Wizard Spider is to create a threat actorfriendly blockchain product. TRM assesses with a high level of confidence that would provide
an additional stream of revenue as well as an internally controlled payment environment for
the cybercrime underground.

Wizard Spider Likely to Remain a Threat
TRM assesses that Wizard Spider will continue to be a significant threat despite recent
setbacks, notably the phasing out of their long used TrickBot tool at the beginning of
February due to its high detection followed by the leak of internal Conti’s information. Wizard
Spider quickly resumed their operations, posting its first victim on March 2, 2022, on their
extortion site. As of March 23, 2022, the syndicate published 41 victims in total with 22 of
them being US entities. These victims are likely to have been breached by Wizard Spider
before the leak and it is unclear if the syndicate was able to obtain access to any new victims
since then.
Based on tracking the continued level of activity and messages posted by Wizard Spider,
TRM analysts assess that the group is likely to fully restore their operational capacity in the
near future and will continue to run their operations under the same name and not rebrand.
Unlike several other major ransomware operations, which have stated publicly and on the
dark web that they do not target critical infrastructure, Conti/Ryuk has continued to target the
healthcare system even during the COVID-19 pandemic as noted in the Health & Human
Services report “Conti Ransomware and the Health Sector.”
Proprietary source reporting has indicated that several other ransomware groups have
struggled to keep up with all of the entities they have gained access to or to develop an
effective pipeline of accesses, due to a lack of employees such as programmers,
negotiators, and others. Conti’s focus on hiring can be seen as evidence of Conti’s efforts to
be able to run their operation on an industrial scale, bringing things like gaining access and
distribution of the malware in house, allowing them to net hundreds of millions in victim
payments over the years, based on TRM analysis.

Conti’s hiring process consists of the interview and test assignment to measure the
candidate’s skills level. In order to attract new employees “Salamandra”, the threat actor in
charge of the group’s HR, utilizes many available resources, from dark web forums to the
Russian commercial job posting site hh[.]ru.

Based on the chats, the average salary for threat actors is nearly $2,000 USD a month.
While that salary is nearly two times higher than the average salary in the IT industry in
Russia according to salaryexplorer[.]com, the compensation can seem low when compared
to the millions of dollars in payments that Wizard Spider received from its victims. The ability
to spend a relatively small percentage of their income on salaries may be one of the reasons
the core members of Wizard Spider preferred to work with full-time employees as opposed to
the profit-sharing ransomware-as-a-service that most other ransomware groups currently
prefer.

Outlook
TRM is monitoring the discussion of the leaked chats on the dark web to get a sense of the
opinions of other threat actors about the arrangement. In the past, programmers on the dark
web have leaked the source code for malware in retaliation when they felt that they had not
been paid a sufficient percentage of the profit it generated, as happened in the case of the
Buhtrap leak according to proprietary sources.
The research done by TRM analysts demonstrates how critical tracking the flow of funds can
be in understanding the operation of cybercriminal organizations. Although cryptocurrency
has made it possible for ransomware to run successful operations for years and provides a
high level of return on investment for threat actors’ efforts, TRM blockchain analytical tool

allows investigations to follow the flow of funds and uncover valuable intelligence that helps
to connect the dots. TRM continues to monitor Wizard Spider’s activity both on and off-chain
to help mitigate the risk posed by Conti ransomware.
Considering Wizard Spider’s statement on supporting the Russian State and sharing its
political agenda, and their past willingness to target critical infrastructure, the syndicate might
also pose a risk to national security due to its level of sophistication.
