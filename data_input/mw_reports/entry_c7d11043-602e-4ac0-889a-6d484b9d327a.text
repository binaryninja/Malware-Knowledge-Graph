APT5: Citrix ADC Threat Hunting Guidance
Executive summary
APT5 has demonstrated capabilities against Citrix® Application Delivery Controller™
(ADC™) deployments (“Citrix ADCs”). Targeting Citrix ADCs can facilitate illegitimate
access to targeted organizations by bypassing normal authentication controls. As such,
NSA, in collaboration with partners, has developed this threat hunting guidance to
provide steps organizations can take to look for possible artifacts of this type of activity.
Please note that this guidance does not represent all techniques, tactics, or procedures
(TTPs) the actors may use when targeting these environments. This activity has been
attributed to APT5, also known as UNC2630 and MANGANESE.

Introduction
NSA recommends organizations hosting Citrix ADC environments take the following
steps as part of their investigation. Treat these detection mechanisms as independent
ways of identifying potentially malicious activity on impacted systems. Artifacts may vary
based on the environment and the stage of that activity. As such, NSA recommends
investigating any positive result even if other detections return no findings.

File Integrity
A malicious actor enabling continued access will likely require modification to legitimate
binaries. Therefore, NSA recommends organizations regularly check key executables in
their environments for any deviations from the known good copies associated with their
running version. Key executables are those binaries essential for proper execution of
the Citrix ADC appliance. These files include, but may not be limited to: nsppe, nsaaad,
nsconf, nsreadfile, and nsconmsg. The following command can be executed from a
shell to facilitate this comparison:
cd /netscaler ; for i in “nsppe nsaaad nsconf nsreadfile nsconmsg”; do md5
${i} ; done

The MD5 hashes should be compared to known good hashes from the vendor or hashes
of the respective binaries from a known good copy downloaded from the vendor. Any
deviation requires further investigation.

Additionally, the following command can indicate tampering by one APT5 technique. This
is indicated by one line of output, but no output otherwise:
procstat –v $(pgrep –o –i nsppe) | grep “0x10400000 “ | grep “rwx”

NSA also recommends that organizations take scheduled tech support bundles 1 and/or
snapshots of their running environment and store them in an offline or otherwise
immutable location to create a forensic history of systems. These backups can be used
to compare running instances or to reconstruct events if suspicious activity is identified.

Behavioral Checks
In addition to any alterations of legitimate binaries, some of APT5’s activities may be
visible in various system logs. NSA recommends that organizations leverage off-device
logging mechanisms for all system logs, to include dmesg and ns.log, and actively
monitor them for the following activity:


Instances of pb_policy appearing in logs without being linked to expected
administrator activity.


The actors have been seen leveraging tools that run 'pb_policy' twice.
This creates the following logs in ns.log:

<local0.info> [hostname] pb_policy: Changing pitboss policy from X to Y
<local0.info> [hostname] pb_policy: Changing pitboss policy from Y to X

Where X and Y are constant values for your system.


Gaps in logs, or mismatches between logs on the device and in your remote
logging solution.



Legitimate user account activity without a corresponding record of a valid SAML
token being issued by the identity provider for the environment.



Unauthorized modification of user permissions.



Unauthorized modifications to the crontab file and/or existence of suspicious
file(s) in /var/cron/tabs/ and other locations.


Files related to this activity have been discovered in /tmp for some, but not
all, impacted organizations.



The command below can assist in finding files that have been associated
with this activity. While these files have not been discovered in all
environments, their presence may be indicative of actor activity if
discovered.
find / -type f -name “res*” | grep -E ‘res($|\.[a-z]{3})$’

Mitigations
In the event that you have results from the above detection methodology, NSA
recommends the following steps to mitigate the activity, to the extent applicable in your
environment:


Move all Citrix ADC instances behind a VPN or other capability that requires valid
user authentication (ideally multi-factor) prior to being able to access the ADC.



Isolate the Citrix ADC appliances from the environment to ensure any malicious
activity is contained.



Restore the Citrix ADC to a known good state.

Even if you do not have any indications of malicious activity, ensure that your Citrix ADC
appliances are running a current version with the latest updates.

Conclusion
The indicators and context from this analysis can be used by organizations for
defensive purposes against this malicious activity. NSA requests that any additional
insights and/or discoveries be shared with the NSA Cybersecurity Collaboration Center
in order to enhance understanding of this activity and so that it can be used to improve
the overall security posture of the Defense Industrial Base, DoD, and USG.
