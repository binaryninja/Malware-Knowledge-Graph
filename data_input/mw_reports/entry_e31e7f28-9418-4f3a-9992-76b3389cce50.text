BITTER: A Targeted Attack Against Pakistan
blogs.forcepoint.com /security-labs/bitter-targeted-attack-against-pakistan

Introduction
Forcepoint Security Labs™ recently encountered a strain of attacks that appear to target
Pakistani nationals. We named the attack "BITTER" based on the network communication
header used by the latest variant of remote access tool (RAT) used:

Our investigation indicates that the campaign has existed since at least November 2013
but has remained active until today. This post intends to share the results of our research.

Infection Vector
Spear-phishing emails are used to target prospective BITTER victims. The campaign
predominantly used the older, relatively popular Microsoft Oﬃce exploit, CVE-2012-0158,
in order to download and execute a RAT binary from a website. Below is an example of a
spear-phishing email they used earlier this month. The recipient is an individual from a
government branch in Pakistan, while the sender purports to be coming from another
government branch of Pakistan:

Other attachment ﬁlenames they used that also contained the CVE-2012-0158 exploit are
as follows:
Requirement List.doc
Cyber Espionage Prevention.doc
New email guidelines.doc
Gazala-ke-haseen-nagme.doc
Rules.xls
In one instance, they used a RAR SFX dropper that drops both their RAT and a picture of
a Pakistani woman as a decoy. A quick Google image search on the dropped picture
indicates that the picture was grabbed from Pakistani dating sites.

RAT Component
BITTER used RATs that are compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0. They use a
few iterations of their RAT with the main diﬀerence being the RAT's command and control
(C2) communication method. Earlier variants communicated to its C2 via an unencrypted
HTTP POST. Below is an example of an older variant's phone home request:

2/13

Newer ones, on the other hand, use encrypted TCP connection such as the one shown in
the introduction above. Both older and newer variants are used simultaneously today in
the campaign.
The RAT version (SHA1 d7a770233848f42c5e1d5f4b88472f7cb12d5f3d) that they used
in their latest campaign is capable of executing the following backdoor capabilities,
essentially allowing the attackers to gain full remote control over a victim's PC:
Get system information - computer name, current user name, and operating
system
Enumerate logical drives
Enumerate and log ﬁles and their corresponding timestamps
Open a remote command shell
List processes with active UDP connections
Manipulate running processes
Manipulate ﬁles
Download a ﬁle
In addition, the vast majority of their RAT binaries contained the following digital signature
with a non-trusted CA Root certiﬁcate:

The following table shows the timeline of appearance of BITTER RATs, based on their
compilation timestamps, along with their embedded PDB paths:

It is important to note that some of these RATs are distributed at a later time than their
compilation date.

Command and Control
BITTER used free dynamic DNS (DDNS) and dedicated server hosting services in order
to set up their C2s. The download site where the exploit documents download the RAT
binaries are, in most cases, diﬀerent from the actual RAT C2. However, both of them are
typically registered using a Gmail email address and a spoofed identity purporting to be
either from United Kingdom or Great Britain. Below is an example of a spoofed registrant
information for the C2, spiralbook71[.]com:

A list of all related malicious domains we managed to collect are as follows:
The email
address witribehelp@gmail.com points
to an empty Google Plus proﬁle with the
name "WhatsApp Support". Interestingly,
however, the account is connected to
another Google Plus account with the
handle "Love Pakistan":

Intent
While cyber-espionage is a common motivation for targeted attacks, this is often hard to
conclude unless a forensic investigation is conducted on the actual victims' machines. In
some cases, speciﬁc capabilities in RATs provides us with clues on what the attackers'
true intents are.
One of the backdoor capabilities mentioned above is the logging of ﬁles and ﬁles' time
stamps from the victim's machine. Furthermore, an older variant of their RAT from 2014
that has the SHA1 3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2 are found to look for
more speciﬁc ﬁle types. After identifying the logical drives from a victim PC, this RAT
variant proceeds to enumerate ﬁles and check if they match any of the hard coded
document and archive ﬁle extensions below:

7/13

While it is hard to conclude based only on these artifacts, the nature of these targeted ﬁle
types suggests that the attackers may be after sensitive documents.

Other Tools Used
In December 2015 one of the campaign's download sites hosted a binary
at scholars90[.]website/putty. The downloaded ﬁle is a free SSH and Telnet client
application called "PuTTY", which has been used in the past in other targeted attacks.
In addition, the same RAT variant previously
mentioned (SHA1 3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2) connects to the
C2 info2t[.]com/m2s.php. This has also served as a C2 for at least two AndroRAT
variants in the past. The following diagram shows these relationships:
8/13

AndroRAT is an open source remote administration tool for Android. Its GitHub repository
lists the following capabilities:
Get contacts (and all theirs informations)
Get call logs
Get all messages
Location by GPS/Network
Monitoring received messages in live
Monitoring phone state in live (call received, call sent, call missed..)
Take a picture from the camera
Stream sound from microphone (or other sources..)
Streaming video (for activity based client only)
9/13

Do a toast
Send a text message
Give call
Open an URL in the default browser
Do vibrate the phone
The AndroRAT variant with SHA1 7d47ae3114f08ecf7fb473b7f5571d70cf2556da
disguises itself as the Islam Adhan Alarm - an Android app that alerts to prayer times of
Islam, which is the state religion of Pakistan. The variant with SHA1
645a6e53116f1fd7ece91549172480c0c78df0f, on the other hand, disguises itself
as Kashmir News app. Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of South Asia
and is a disputed territory between India and Pakistan.

Protection Statement
Stage 2 (Lure) - Spear-phishing e-mails associated with this attack are identiﬁed
and blocked.
Stage 5 (Dropper File) - Related RATs are prevented from being downloaded.
Stage 6 (Call Home) - Communication between the RAT and command and control
are blocked.

Conclusion
Many targeted attacks continue to be discovered today. It is interesting to see that while
these attacks are not always sophisticated in nature, the same characteristic allows them
to stay under the radar by blending in with common attacks in the wild. BITTER is able to
achieve this by using available online services such as free DDNS, dedicated server
hosting and Gmail to setup their C2s. Such setup is exhibited by today's common
malware.
It is worth noting that in all the artifacts collected in this research, none of the English
words that were used had spelling errors, suggesting that the actors behind BITTER are
proﬁcient in the English language. Furthermore, as discussed above, all the artifacts we
have seen are consistent with Pakistan being the target of this group. There may be other
targets that have not been discovered yet or BITTER may be a branch of a larger
10/13

campaign with broader targets, but only time will tell whether any of these are correct.
