A somewhat interesting and slightly alarming malware campaign, spreading worldwide but
supposed to be targeting the USA that pretends to be an urgent message from the CDC (
Centre for Disease Control ) warning about a flu outbreak. This delivers Gandcrab 5.2
ransomware that currently does not have free decryption available yet.
They are using email addresses and subjects that will scare, shock, persuade or entice a
recipient to read the email and open the attachment.
Remember many email clients or webmail services, especially on a mobile phone or tablet,
only show the Name in the From: and not the bit in <domain.com >. That is why these
scams and phishes and malware deliveries work so well.
To confuse the issue even more the subject line was written in what looks like a mix of cyrillic
& western characters & encoded in UTF8 format so a computer will automatically translate /
decode it. When I first tried to post this, I got a garbled mess of characters in the url to this
post where the Copy & pasting from the email picked up the utf8 format
Subject: =?utf-8?B?Rmx1IHDQsG5k0LVtaWMgd9Cwcm5pbmcu?=

The CDC has not been hacked or had their email or other servers compromised. They are
not sending the emails to you. They are just innocent victims in exactly the same way as
every recipient of these emails. These came from numerous different email addresses &
domains on the same server
The email looks like:

Subject: Flu pаndеmic wаrning.

Fake CDC email

The Word doc attachment is almost empty with just an Urgent Notice Heading. The
scumbags trying to compromise you are hoping that you will enable content & editing to
enable the macros that let this run.

The C2 for this is a well known site https://www.kakaocorp.link/static/tmp/eshe.png
where the ransomware posts encrypted / encoded details about the compromised computer.
As usual this still drops a text file in each folder that it has encrypted and changes the
desktop background
The ransom note looks like this ( I have blurred out a lot of the content) the computer data
section is the same as the details sent to the C2

fake CDC email list

All the alleged senders, companies, names of employees, phone numbers, amounts,
reference numbers etc. mentioned in the emails are all innocent and are just picked at
random. Some of these companies will exist and some won’t. Don’t try to respond by
phone or email, all you will do is end up with an innocent person or company who
have had their details spoofed and picked at random from a long list that the bad guys
6/10

have previously found . The bad guys choose companies, Government departments and
other organisations with subjects that are designed to entice you or alarm you into blindly
opening the attachment or clicking the link in the email to see what is happening.
This email attachment contains what appears to be a genuine word doc or Excel XLS
spreadsheet with either a macro script or an embedded OLE object that when run will infect
you.
Modern versions of Microsoft office, that is Office 2010, 2013, 2016 and Office 365 should be
automatically set to higher security to protect you.
By default protected view is enabled and macros are disabled, UNLESS you or your
company have enabled them. If protected view mode is turned off and macros are enabled
then opening this malicious word document will infect you, and simply previewing it in
windows explorer or your email client might well be enough to infect you. Definitely DO NOT
follow the advice they give to enable macros or enable editing to see the content.
Most of these malicious word documents either appear to be totally blank or look something
like these images when opened in protected view mode, which should be the default in
Office 2010, 2013, 2016 and 365. Some versions pretend to have a digital RSA key and
say you need to enable editing and Macros to see the content. Do NOT enable Macros or
editing under any circumstances.

What can be infected by this
At this time, these malicious macros only infect windows computers. They do not affect a
Mac, IPhone, IPad, Blackberry, Windows phone or Android phone. The malicious word
or excel file can open on any device with an office program installed, and potentially the
macro will run on Windows or Mac or any other device with Microsoft Office installed. BUT
the downloaded malware that the macro tries to download is windows specific, so will not
harm, install or infect any other computer except a windows computer. You will not be
infected if you do not have macros enabled in Excel or Word. These Macros do not run in
“Office Online” Open Office, Libre Office, Word Perfect or any other office program that can
read Word or Excel files.
7/10

Please read our How to protect yourselves page for simple, sensible advice on how to avoid
being infected by this sort of socially engineered malware. Also please read our post about
word macro malware and how to avoid being infected by them
Be very careful with email attachments. All of these emails use Social engineering tricks to
persuade you to open the attachments that come with the email. It might be a
simple message saying “look at this picture of me I took last night” that appears to come from
a friend. It might be a scare ware message that will make you open the attachment to see
what you are accused of doing. Frequently it is more targeted at somebody ( small
companies etc.) who regularly receive PDF attachments or Word .doc attachments or any
other common file that you use every day, for example an invoice addressed to
sales@victimcompany.com.
The basic rule is NEVER open any attachment to an email, unless you are expecting it. Now
that is very easy to say but quite hard to put into practice, because we all get emails with files
attached to them. Our friends and family love to send us pictures of them doing silly things,
or even cute pictures of the children or pets. Many of us routinely get Word, Excel or
PowerPoint attachments in the course of work or from companies that we already have a
relationship with.
Never just blindly click on the file in your email program. Always save the file to your
downloads folder, so you can check it first. A lot of malicious files that are attached to emails
will have a faked extension. That is the 3 letters at the end of the file name. Unfortunately
windows by default hides the file extensions so you need to Set your folder options to
“show known file types. Then when you unzip the zip file that is supposed to contain the
pictures of “Sally’s dog catching a ball”, an invoice or receipt from some company for a
product or service or receive a Word doc or Excel file report that work has supposedly sent
you to finish working on at the weekend, you can easily see if it is a picture or document &
not a malicious program. If you see JS or .EXE or .COM or .PIF or .SCR or .HTA .vbs,
.wsf , .jse .jar at the end of the file name DO NOT click on it or try to open it, it will infect
you.
With these malformed infected word, excel and other office documents that normally contain
a vba macro virus, the vital thing is do not open any office document direct from your email
client or the web. Always save the document to a safe location on your computer, normally
your downloads folder or your documents folder and scan it with your antivirus. Many
Antiviruses do not natively detect vba macro-viruses in real time protection and you need to
enable document or office protection in the settings. Do not rely on your Anti-Virus to
immediately detect the malware or malicious content. DO NOT enable editing mode or
enable macros
All modern versions of word and other office programs, that is 2010, 2013, 2016 and
365, should open all Microsoft office documents that is word docs, excel files and
PowerPoint etc that are downloaded from the web or received in an email automatically in
8/10

“protected view” that stops any embedded malware or macros from being displayed and
running. Make sure protected view is set in all office programs to protect you and your
company from these sorts of attacks and do not over ride it to edit the document until you are
100% sure that it is a safe document. If the protected mode bar appears when opening the
document DO NOT enable editing mode or enable macros the document will look blank or
have a warning message, but will be safe.
Be aware that there are a lot of dodgy word docs spreading that WILL infect you with no
action from you if you are still using an out dated or vulnerable version of word. This is a
good reason to update your office programs to a recent version and stop using office 2003
and 2007. Many of us have continued to use older versions of word and other office
programs, because they are convenient, have the functions and settings we are used to and
have never seen a need to update to the latest super-duper version. The risks in using older
version are now seriously starting to outweigh the convenience, benefits and cost of keeping
an old version going.
I strongly urge you to update your office software to the latest version and stop putting
yourself at risk, using old out of date software.
