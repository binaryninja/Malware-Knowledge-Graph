Key Findings
New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard was targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus
spyware via a June 2018 SMS message promising details about “Ben Hubbard and the
story of the Saudi Royal Family.”
The SMS contained a hyperlink to a website used by a Pegasus operator that we call
KINGDOM. We have linked KINGDOM to Saudi Arabia. In 2018, KINGDOM also
targeted Saudi dissidents including Omar Abdulaziz, Ghanem al-Masarir1, and Yahya
Assiri, as well as a staff member at Amnesty International.
Hubbard is among a growing group of journalists targeted with Pegasus spyware. As
part of our continued investigation into threats against journalists, Citizen Lab also
identified evidence suggesting a Pegasus operator may have been infecting targets
while impersonating the Washington Post in the weeks leading up to and after
Khashoggi’s killing in 2018. There is no overlap between this activity and reported
events surrounding the mobile phone of Jeff Bezos.

1. Background
Pegasus is the name of a mobile phone spyware product made by NSO Group, an Israelibased company that develops and sells surveillance technology.2 Since 2016, researchers
have documented the abuse of Pegasus against journalists, human rights defenders, and
members of civil society. In one case, Pegasus was used to target the wife of a slain
journalist in Mexico.

Several reports by Citizen Lab and Amnesty International in 2018 showed that a Saudi-linked
Pegasus operator that we call KINGDOM was targeting dissidents and regime critics. On
July 31, 2018, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab reported that an Amnesty International
staffer, as well as a “Saudi activist based abroad” (later identified as London-based dissident
Yahya Assiri) was targeted with Pegasus. On October 1, 2018, Citizen Lab reported that
Canadian permanent resident and Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz was targeted with
Pegasus. During the period when his phone was monitored, Abdulaziz was apparently in
close contact with murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashogghi.

operator in 2018.
On November 11, 2018, Forbes reported that Saudi dissident, Ghanem al-Masarir, was
targeted with Pegasus. If the targets had clicked on the links in the text messages they
received, the KINGDOM operator would have been able to closely monitor these individuals’
communications and plans. Abdulaziz filed a lawsuit against NSO Group in Israel, and alMasarir filed a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia in the UK.

2. New York Times Reporter Targeted
Ben Hubbard is the Beirut Bureau Chief of the New York Times. Prior to his promotion to that
role, Hubbard reported on Saudi Arabia, including on Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman
(MbS). In an announcement of his promotion, the New York Times noted that Hubbard had
“turned out deeply revealing reports from a closed society that is changing rapidly under a
headstrong crown prince,” and had “…peeled back the curtain from the prince’s relentless
consolidation of power.”

2.1. Pegasus Infection Attempt
On June 21, 2018, Hubbard received an SMS on his phone stating in Arabic: “Ben Hubbard
and the story of the Saudi Royal Family.” Hubbard provided this message to the Citizen Lab
in October 2018 for analysis. With Hubbard’s consent, we are now able to report on this
case.

June 21, 2018 (screenshots courtesy of Ben Hubbard).
The link sent to Hubbard led to the site arabnews365[.]com, and was sent from a sender that
called themselves “Arabnews.” The full link is:
https://arabnews365[.]com/wqbgGdwlk

Hubbard recalls that he did not click on the link and we are not able to determine whether his
phone was successfully infected.

2.2. Connection with Pegasus Infrastructure
At the time the SMS was sent to Hubbard, the arabnews365[.]com domain was active and
belonged to the portion of NSO Group’s Pegasus infrastructure used by the KINGDOM
operator. The domain was also <independently identified by Amnesty International as
belonging to NSO Group’s infrastructure. In a previous report, we provided a comprehensive
technical description of how we identify and scan for Pegasus infrastructure. In this section,
we briefly summarize this process.

In 2016, Citizen Lab published the Million Dollar Dissident report, the first public research to
identify NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. In Million Dollar Dissident, we reported on an
attempted intrusion of United Arab Emirates (UAE) activist Ahmed Mansoor’s phone using a
text message with a malicious link promising “New secrets about torture of Emiratis in state
prisons.”
Our investigation included scanning the Internet to find Command & Control (C&C) servers
that behaved similarly to the ones communicating with the spyware sent to Mansoor. While
the Pegasus servers we found were pulled offline even before we published Million Dollar
Dissident, we continued to monitor them in case some of them might come back online. In
the weeks after our report, we noticed a small number of Pegasus servers that came back
online, but the servers no longer matched our fingerprint. We built a new fingerprint based on
this behaviour, and began conducting regular Internet scans to find servers matching this
new fingerprint.
In September 2018, Citizen Lab published Hide and Seek: Tracking NSO Group’s Pegasus
Spyware to Operations in 45 Countries, which described the results of this follow-up
scanning, conducted between August 2016 and August 2018. In these scans, we detected
1,091 IP addresses and 1,041 domain names matching our new fingerprint. We further
grouped these IPs and domains into 36 distinct Pegasus operators using a technique we
developed and named Athena. We also devised a new way to conduct DNS Cache Probing,
and used this method to find likely infections, by identifying Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
where one or more user was repeatedly looking up domain names associated with Pegasus
C&C servers.

3. Commercial Spyware Harms Democracy, Press Freedom
As anti-democratic, authoritarian forces are on the rise in many countries, journalists are
increasingly targets for surveillance and physical harm. Products like NSO Group’s Pegasus
spyware provide government clients with a powerful tool to surreptitiously monitor journalists,
their sources, and the stories on which they are reporting. Many of NSO Group’s clients
appear to lack rigorous oversight over their security services, and have a track record of
human rights abuses, including threats against journalists.

3.1. A Growing List of Journalists Targeted with Pegasus
Since 2016, investigations conducted by Citizen Lab and other researchers have now
identified at least 13 journalists and civic media actors targeted with Pegasus spyware
(Figure 4). In Mexico alone, we have documented at least nine journalists targeted with
Pegasus. Azam Ahmed of The New York Times believes he may have received an infection
attempt while working in Mexico, but the message was deleted before Citizen Lab was able
to analyze it.

Troublingly, in both Mexico and Saudi Arabia, spyware infection attempts have been linked to
or associated with targeted killings. For example, our report into Saudi surveillance of Omar
Abdulaziz was published October 1, 2018. The following day, Jamal Khashoggi—Abdulaziz’s
confidant with whom he had been communicating with for months—was executed. Similarly,
two days after Mexican investigative journalist Javier Valdez Cárdenas was gunned down in
a cartel-linked murder, his wife and colleagues received SMS messages designed to install
Pegasus on their phones. These links between murders and attempts of targeted
surveillance are echoed by recent investigative reporting in the Financial Times detailing
targeting against the Rwandan diaspora, including opposition activists and other exiles
threatened by Rwandan death squads.

3.2. An NSO Operator May Have Masqueraded as the Washington
Post
Citizen Lab has also identified evidence suggesting that a Pegasus operator may have been
masquerading as the Washington Post to infect targets in the weeks before and after the
October 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi. While the timing overlaps with the killing, the two
are not necessarily related. We have very recently shared some technical details with the
Post’s information security team, and there are no indications that this targeting affected
anyone at the Washington Post. We also note that there is no overlap between the timeline
of this activity and recently reported events surrounding the mobile phone of Jeff Bezos.

3.3. Commercial Spyware Used to Hack Journalists
NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware is not the only commercial surveillance technology on the
market, nor is commercial spyware the only means by which abusive surveillance of
journalists can be carried out.
Prior Citizen Lab research has identified targeted espionage against Ethiopian journalists
linked to the Ethiopian government, and using spyware sold by Hacking Team (now known
as Memento Labs) and Cyberbit (an Israeli-based spyware vendor). Our Stealth Falcon
report detailed a targeted digital espionage campaign against UK-based journalist Rori
Donaghy using bespoke spyware linked in media reports to UAE-based cybersecurity firm
Dark Matter. Likewise, our research has documented numerous cases of targeted digital
espionage against journalists and news organizations covering Russia, Tibet, and China,
dating back to 2009.
Academic research on journalist security show that journalists do not share the same digital
security practices and perceptions across the profession. For example, a study found that a
common mindset for journalists is to only prioritise digital security if they perceive the stories
they are working on as sensitive enough to attract the attention of government authorities.

7/9

Echoing these findings, ongoing research by the Citizen Lab finds that investigative reporters
tend to take digital security more seriously than their peers who work on non-investigative
beats, and have higher familiarity with digital security tools and practices.
As an investigative reporter covering a sensitive topic, Ben Hubbard was wary of suspicious
messages and chose to share the one he received with us for analysis. Yet, not all targeted
journalists are working on a topic where the risk of surveillance may be so obvious.
Some studies show that differences in education and training, alongside other variables such
as financial incentives and institutional culture, may play a key role in closing or
compounding gaps in digital security practices. For example, a peer-reviewed study that
interviewed journalists in the US and France found journalists, editors, and technical staff
may conceptualise and prioritise security issues differently, to the effect that reporters may
resist and resent top down efforts to change security practices, or may see security as
important, but struggle to get institutional support towards its implementation. Another such
study involving US-based journalists found a general lack of security culture in journalism
and conflict between journalists and IT professionals within news organisations as among
the key barriers to journalists adopting secure tools and practices.
The Citizen Lab recently conducted a survey of 124 journalism schools across the US and
Canada to probe what digital security courses they offered. Only half of the schools surveyed
offered some form of digital security training, and only a quarter required it. Among programs
that offered training, the majority devoted less than two hours to the subject.
Taken together, this body of research shows that more action is needed to prepare
journalists for the digital threats they face. We believe that reports—such as this one—that
continue to expose real cases of digital threats faced by journalists may help motivate those
agitating for more methodical attention to digital security in journalism schools and news
organizations.

4. Conclusion
The targeting of yet another journalist—in this case at the New York Times—makes it clear
that the current regulatory regime for the spyware industry is not working. Absent strong
regulation and control, the industry will continue to bolster authoritarianism by helping
powerful elites invisibly thwart the work of journalists seeking to hold them to account.
In 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom
of opinion and expression concluded that existing legal frameworks are insufficient, and
called for a moratorium on the export, sale, transfer, use, or servicing of privately developed
surveillance tools until a human rights-compliant safeguards regime is in place.

8/9

Unfortunately, states have not acted—leading victims to take accountability into their own
hands. In 2019 alone, several lawsuits were filed against spyware companies and their
government clients, with plaintiffs including spyware targets, a human rights organization,
and a major tech company. While these lawsuits may be the best option in the short-term,
this piecemeal approach cannot provide the same benefits as comprehensive regulation of
the industry. Until there is action on this front, the media and other institutions that protect us
all are vulnerable like never before.
