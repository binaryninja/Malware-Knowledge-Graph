Stuxnet And Its Hidden Lessons
On the Ethics Of Cyberweapons
By P.W. Singer 1
In 2010, computer programmers around the world noticed
a strange kind of cyber attack—although it had global reach, it
was highly targeted and very sophisticated. A German team, led
by Ralph Langner, figured out that the worm, now known as
Stuxnet, specifically targeted certain operations related to the
Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, causing the enrichment
centrifuges to break down without any notice or apparent
reason. As news of this new worm and its effects spread around
the globe, the role of cyber attacks within the laws of war came
into the forefront of discussions about the future of armed
conflict. This article examines how Stuxnet changed the nature
of cyber attacks and the ongoing discussion of where digital
technology fits into the laws of war.

I. The Digital Mystery
Ralph Langner is a jovial fellow with a quick wit, whose sense of
whimsy is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that he wears cowboy
boots. Wearing cowboy boots shouldn’t be all that notable, until one
realizes that Ralph is not from Texas, but Germany, and is not a
cowboy, but a computer specialist. Langner is also incredibly
inquisitive. It was this combination that led him to play a role in the
discovery of one of the most notable weapons in history; and not just
cyber history, but history overall.
Since 1988, Ralph and his team of security experts have been
advising organizations on the safety of large-scale computer system
installations. Their special focus was industrial control systems, such
as the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA),

that monitor and run industrial processes. SCADA is used in
everything from the management and operation of power plants to
the manufacture of candy wrappers. 2
In 2010, like many other industrial control and cybersecurity
experts around the world, Ralph grew concerned about the cyber
worm of unknown origin that was spreading across the world and
embedding itself in these control systems. Thousands of computers in
places like India and the United States had been infected. But the
bulk of the infections (roughly 60 percent) were in Iran. This led
many experts to infer that either Iran had particularly poor cyber
defenses for its SCADA-related programs, which made it more
vulnerable, or a virus had initially targeted some site in Iran and, as
one report put it, “subsequently failed in its primary purpose and run
amok, spreading uncontrollably to unintended targets all over the
world, and thus demonstrating how indiscriminate and destructive
cyber weapons were likely to be.” 3

II. Stuxnet and Its Characteristics
A. Getting Past Operating System Security

Both turned out to be far from the case. Various teams of cyber
experts from around the world began dissecting the code of this cyber
worm, which became known as Stuxnet, and debates grew over its
origin and targets. 4 Ralph and his team were curious, and the more
they explored the code, the more interested they became in it. It was
a wonderfully complex piece of malware like none the world had ever
seen. It had at least four new “zero days” (previously unknown
vulnerabilities), utilized digital signatures with the private keys of two
certificates stolen from separate well-known companies, and worked
on all Windows operating systems down to the decade-old Windows
95 edition. 5 The number of new zero days particularly stood out.
Hackers prize zero days and do not like to reveal them when they
don’t have to. To use four at once was unprecedented and almost
illogical given that one new open door is enough. It was a pretty good

sign that Stuxnet’s makers had enormous resources and wanted to be
absolutely certain they would penetrate their target.
Stuxnet also slipped by the Windows’ defenses using the
equivalent of a stolen passport. To gain access to the kernel, or
operating system’s control system, Stuxnet had to install a component
that could talk to the kernel. The authors chose to target a device
driver, a common tool that allows hardware devices to interact with
the operating system. Windows uses a scheme of digital signatures to
allow trusted hardware manufacturers to write device drivers that are
trusted by the operating system. Unsigned drivers raise an alert for
the user, while signed drivers do not. 6 The drivers in Stuxnet were
signed by two real companies in Taiwan, indicating that the authors
had access to the secret signing keys which were most likely stolen.
Again, this is a rare style of attack: stolen signing keys are incredibly
powerful, would have been well protected, and would be very valuable
in any illicit market.
B. Stuxnet’s Target

Rather than being truly infectious, the malware’s DNA revealed
something even more interesting: Stuxnet was hunting for something
in particular. As Langner delved deeper, he discovered that Stuxnet
was not going after computers or even Windows software in general,
but a specific type of program used in Siemens’s WinCC/PCS 7
SCADA control software. Indeed, if this software was not present, the
worm had built-in controls to become inert. 7 In addition, rather than
trying to spread as widely as possible, as was the goal with past
worms, Stuxnet only allowed each infected computer to spread the
worm to no more than three other computers. It even came with a
final safeguard of a self-destruct mechanism, which caused the worm
to basically erase itself in 2012. Whoever made Stuxnet not only had
a specific target in mind, but didn’t want the code lingering in the
wild forever. 8 This was a very different worm, indeed.
But what was the target? This was the true mystery. Here,
Langner’s background in working with industrial firms proved
particularly useful. He figured out that Stuxnet was only going after a
specific industrial controller, manufactured by Siemens and configured
to run a series of nuclear centrifuges. But the target was not just any
set of nuclear centrifuges; rather, it targeted only a cascade of

centrifuges of a certain size and number (984) linked together. Not so
coincidentally, this was the exact setup at the Natanz nuclear facility,
a site suspected to be part of Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program. 9
Things got especially tricky once Stuxnet found its way into this
target (it was later revealed that the delivery mechanism was
infiltration through Iranian nuclear scientists’ own laptops and
memory sticks). The attack didn’t shut down the centrifuges in any
obvious manner. Instead, it ran a series of subroutines. One, known as
a man in the middle, caused tiny adjustments in the pressure inside
the centrifuges. Another manipulated the speed of the centrifuges’
spinning rotors, causing them to first slow down, then return to
normal speed, destabilizing the rotors and ruining their work. On top
of this, the malware would occasionally push the centrifuge speeds
past the designed maximum. As a result, the centrifuges not only
failed to produce refined uranium fuel, they frequently broke down
and ground to a halt from the damaging vibrations caused by the
various random surges. At other times, the machines literally spun
out of control and exploded.
The effect, Langner wrote, was “as good as using explosives”
against the facility. In fact, it was better. The victim had “no clue of
being under a cyber attack.” Stuxnet had been inside Iranian
networks for over a year, but the nuclear scientists initially thought
their facility was just suffering from a series of random breakdowns.
The scientists just kept replacing the broken centrifuges with new
ones, which would then get infected and break again. 10 Eventually,
though, they wondered whether they were being sold faulty parts or
were suffering from some kind of hardware sabotage. But the
machines checked out perfectly every time, except for the fact that
nothing was working the way it should.
C. What Made Stuxnet Different

This was perhaps the most insidious part of Stuxnet: it was an
integrity attack par excellence. Stuxnet didn’t just corrupt the
process; it hid its effects from the operators. It exploited not just
technical vulnerabilities, but their all-too-human trust that the
computer systems would accurately and honestly describe what was
taking place. For a long period of time, the Iranian engineers didn’t
even suspect a cyber attack; their systems were air-gapped from the

Web. 11 Moreover, up to this point, worms and viruses had always had
an obvious effect on the computer, not the hardware. Eventually, the
attacks had another effect: the Iranian scientists suffered low morale,
under the impression that they couldn’t do anything right; seventy
years earlier a bunch of Americans had built an atomic bomb using
slide rulers, and they couldn’t even get their modern-day centrifuges
to work. Overall, Langner likened the Stuxnet effect to the cyber
version of “Chinese water torture.” 12
When Ralph Langer revealed his findings on his blog, the littleknown German researcher quickly became an international celebrity.
First, he had exposed a top-secret campaign of sabotage (later leaked
in the American media to have been a collaborative effort between US
and the Israeli intelligence agencies, known as “Olympic Games”),
and second, it was a find of global importance. 13
Beyond the operation itself and the impact it had on Iran or even
US relations with other states or international law, Stuxnet stood out
as something more. A new kind of weapon long speculated about but
never seen, a specially designed cyber weapon, had finally been used.
Prior cyber “attacks” had stayed within the digital realm, usually
involving the theft, disruption, or manipulation of information. 14
Stuxnet did that, but caused something new, physical consequences.
This made it like prior weapons in general, in that all weapons
throughout history had caused physical damage. But it also took not
merely cybersecurity but war itself into a new realm, being a weapon
that was made of bits, rather than atoms. Like physical unmanned
systems (such as drones), the worm separated the human point of
decision geographically from the point of action, both physically (the
“trigger” was pulled thousands of miles from the target in Iran), and,
arguably, chronologically (the trigger was pulled months before). The
worm was sent into contexts and locales that the sender couldn’t
expect to know. This meant that, by some definitions, Stuxnet was
the first truly autonomous weapon.
Thus when it came time to weigh the new weapon, the debate
diverged. Judith Donath of Harvard University described Stuxnet as a

demonstration of a new kind of weapon that could only get better:
“The musket of cyberwarfare. What will be its rifle? Its AK-47? Its
atomic bomb?” 15 Others worried that these new and better weapons
would promote a new kind of escalation and global risk. “Stuxnet was
the absolute game changer,” wrote cyber thinker Mikko Hypponen.
“We are entering an arms race where countries start stocking
weapons, only it isn’t planes and nuclear reactors they’re stocking,
but it’s cyberweapons.” 16 Still others were concerned of the opposite,
that not enough people took notice of this “opening shot in a war we
will all lose,” says Leslie Harris of the Center for Democracy and
Technology. 17

III. Stuxnet as Cyberweapon
Stuxnet was all of these things, perhaps, but it was also notable
for another reason. This nasty little worm was a superb illustration of
how ethics can be applied to cyberwar.
There is the popular notion that “all is fair in love and war,” but
the reality is that there are actually a series of strict guidelines that
are supposed to shape behavior in war—what 1600s legal thinker
Hugo Grotius called jus in bello, or law in wartime. Its two most
prominent elements are proportionality and discrimination. The law
of proportionality states that the suffering and devastation that one
side causes, especially collateral damage to unintended targets, cannot
outweigh whatever harm prompted the conflict. 18 In other words, if
the other side stole your cow, you can’t justifiably nuke their city.
The law of discrimination maintains that all belligerent sides must
distinguish between legitimate targets (e.g. a military post) and nonlegitimate targets (e.g. civilians or wounded persons), and do their
utmost to only cause harm to the intended, legitimate targets. 19
Stuxnet stood out as a new kind of weapon in that it was
designed to cause physical damage via cyber means. Its makers
wanted it to damage targets in the real world, but only through
action on digital networks. This was novel enough. But what really
distinguished Stuxnet from traditional weapons was how small its
physical impact was, especially in light of the intense stakes. The
target was a nuclear bomb-making program, one that was already the
target of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions. While it is

certainly arguable whether preemptive action against the Iranian
program was justifiable, the Stuxnet attack makes the question of
proportionality relevant. Stuxnet only broke nuclear centrifuges,
which Iran had illegally obtained to conduct illicit research. Moreover,
it neither hurt nor killed anyone. In comparison, when Israel
attempted to obstruct Iraqi nuclear research in 1981, its forces
dropped sixteen 2,000-pound bombs on a research site during
“Operation Opera,” leveling it and killing eleven soldiers and
civilians. 20
Discrimination also matters when judging the ethics of these
attacks. At face value, Stuxnet seems incredibly indiscriminant. While
limited in the scope of its attacks compared to prior malware, this
was a worm that still got around. It infected not just targets in Iran
but thousands of computers across the world that had nothing to do
with Iran or nuclear research. Many lawyers see this facet of cyber
weapons as proof of their inherent violation of “prevailing codes of
international laws of conflict, as they go beyond just the original
target and deliberately target civilian personnel and infrastructure.” 21
Yet this may be a wrong interpretation, outdated for the cyber
age. While Stuxnet lacked discretion under the old way of thinking,
its very design prevented harm to anyone and anything beyond the
intended target. This kind of discrimination was something never
previously possible in a weapon. As George Lucas, a philosopher at
the US Naval Academy, wrote in an assessment of Stuxnet’s ethics,
“Unless you happen to be running a large array of exactly 984
Siemens centrifuges simultaneously, you have nothing to fear from
this worm.” 22
In effect, judging the ethics of Stuxnet and cyber weapons more
generally turns on which part of the story you care about most. Do
you focus on the fact that this new kind of weapon permitted a
preemptive attack and in so doing touched thousands of people and
computers who had nothing to do with Iran or nuclear research? Or
do you focus on the fact that the cyber strike caused far less damage
than any previous comparable attack and that the weapon was so
discriminating it essentially gave new meaning to the term? Are you a
cyberweapon half full or half empty kind of person?

History may render the ultimate judgment of Stuxnet, however.
As Ralph Langner put it, the fascinating new weapon he discovered
“could be considered a textbook example of a ‘just war’ approach. It
didn’t kill anyone. That’s a good thing. But I am afraid this is only a
short-term view. In the long run it has opened Pandora’s box.” 23
