Emulating Telecommunication

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA

Key Judgments
• Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure used
by UAC-0113, a group linked with medium confidence
to Sandworm by CERT-UA. Sandworm is a Russian
advanced persistent threat (APT) group affiliated with
the Main Intelligence Directorate/Main Directorate (GRU/
GU) of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the
Russian Federation.

This report profiles the unique infrastructure used by the threat activity group
UAC-0113, which is linked with moderate confidence by CERT-UA to Sandworm.
The activity was identified through a combination of large-scale automated network
traffic analytics and analysis derived from open source reporting. The report will
be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence
relating to the activities of the Russian government in cyberspace and network
defenders.

Executive Summary

• Identified staging infrastructure continues the trend of
masquerading as telecommunication providers operating
within Ukraine and delivers malicious payloads via an
HTML smuggling technique that deploys Colibri Loader
and Warzone RAT malware.
• Though the intent of the observed decoy document
found in connection with this activity is not fully known,
it’s likely to be deployed against Ukraine-based targets in
support of military action in the region similar to previous
UAC-0113 lures.

Recorded Future continues to monitor cyber espionage

found to resolve to this same IP address and the use of this
domain continues with the theme of emulating telecommunication

domain kievstar[.]online is of note as the spelling is not typically
employed in Ukraine but has been employed previously by the

LNK file ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації.lnk. The folder and
document translate from Ukrainian to English as “APPLICATION”
and “3_APPLICATION-for-receiving-compensation-additionaldiscount-for-the-families-of-the-deceased2.doc”, respectively.
The document itself does not engage in malicious activity
but is used to hide the operations undertaken by the malicious
LNK file. The Ukrainian-language text details that the document
is an application for citizens to request discounts on fuel from
the head of the Zaporozhye Regional Department for Social
Protection in the Oleksandrivka Raion (district), an area in
Donetsk.

Searches within Hatching Triage’s public sandbox revealed
30 distinct uploaded samples that have also communicated with
both of these Colibri Loader C2 domains, with the earliest sample
submitted on July 4, 2022. Within the 30 samples, there are also
references to a range of other malware including:
• Raccoon Stealer
• RedLine Stealer
• Socelars
• Nymaim
• PrivateLoader
• Dark Crystal RAT
• Djvu Ransomware
• Vidar Stealer

Warzone Rat C2 Server
Network analysis of the Warzone RAT sample deployed by file
“jfilyg7.exe”, revealed communication to 2 C2 domains, darkfox[.]
ddns[.]net, which resolves to IP address 94[.]158[.]156[.]4 and
is listed as being hosted in the city of Odesa, Ukraine, and
darksea[.]ddns, which resolves to IP address 91[.]200[.]114[.]141
which is listed as being hosted in Lviv, Ukraine.

• Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),
intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network
defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon
review, consider blocking connection attempts to and
from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in
the appendix.
• Recorded Future Hunting Packages can be used to
hunt for the presence of malicious files associated with
Warzone RAT and Colibri Loader. YARA rules for each
malware family can be found in Appendix D.
• Recorded Future proactively detects malicious server
configurations and provides means to block them in
the Command and Control Security Control Feed. The
Command and Control Feed includes tools used by
UAC-0113 and other Russian state-sponsored threat
activity groups. Recorded Future clients should alert on
and block these C2 servers to allow for detection and
remediation of active intrusions.
• Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party
Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence modules users can
monitor real-time output from Network Traffic Analysis
analytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity
involving your organization or key vendors and partners.
• Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains
spoofing your organization, through the Recorded
Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. The SecurityTrails
extension is available to any customer that has a
subscription to the Threat Intelligence or Brand
Intelligence modules. The LogoType source and alerting
is exclusive to the BI module, though the TI module does
have access to the data via the Advanced Query Builder.

Outlook
Insikt Group continues to track UAC-0113 infrastructure
observing changes in TTPs as its operations diversify across
Ukraine, this time with a significant focus on telecommunication
providers. There has been a notable continuation of the use
of publically available commodity malware showing UAC-0113
adapting its operations with a willingness to use a variety of
tooling.
Readers should detect, block, and hunt for the presence of
the indicators referenced in connection with UAC-0113 reporting
via the Recorded Future Platform in your network monitoring,
intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and any associated
perimeter security appliances.
