The prevailing perception about fileless threats, among the security industry’s biggest areas
of concern today, is that security solutions are helpless against these supposedly invincible
threats. Because fileless attacks run the payload directly in memory or leverage legitimate
system tools to run malicious code without having to drop executable files on the disk, they
present challenges to traditional file-based solutions.
But let’s set the record straight: being fileless doesn’t mean being invisible; it certainly
doesn’t mean being undetectable. There’s no such thing as the perfect cybercrime: even
fileless malware leaves a long trail of evidence that advanced detection technologies in
Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) can detect and
stop.
To help disambiguate the term fileless, we developed a comprehensive definition for fileless
malware as reference for understanding the wide range of fileless threats. We have also
discussed at length the advanced capabilities in Microsoft Defender ATP that counter fileless
techniques.

I recently unearthed a widespread fileless campaign called Astaroth that completely “lived off
the land”: it only ran system tools throughout a complex attack chain. The attack involved
multiple steps that use various fileless techniques and proved a great real-world benchmark
for Microsoft Defender ATP’s capabilities against fileless threats.
In this blog, I will share my analysis of a fileless attack chain that demonstrates:
Attackers would go to great lengths to avoid detection
Advanced technologies in Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus expose and defeat
fileless attacks

Exposing a fileless info-stealing campaign with Microsoft Defender
ATP’s Antivirus
I was doing routine review of Windows Defender Antivirus telemetry when I noticed an
anomaly from a detection algorithm designed to catch a specific fileless technique. Telemetry
showed a sharp increase in the use of the Windows Management Instrumentation
Command-line (WMIC) tool to run a script (a technique that MITRE refers to XSL Script
Processing), indicating a fileless attack.

Figure 1. Windows Defender Antivirus telemetry shows a sudden increase in suspicious
activity
After some hunting, I discovered the campaign that aimed to run the Astaroth backdoor
directly in memory. Astaroth is a notorious info-stealing malware known for stealing sensitive
information like credentials, keystrokes, and other data, which it exfiltrates and sends to a
remote attacker. The attacker can then use stolen data to try moving laterally across
networks, carry out financial theft, or sell victim information in the cybercriminal underground.
While the behavior may slightly vary in some instances, the attack generally followed these
steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email leads to an LNK file. When double-clicked,
the LNK file causes the execution of the WMIC tool with the “/Format” parameter, which

allows the download and execution of a JavaScript code. The JavaScript code in turn
downloads payloads by abusing the Bitsadmin tool.
All the payloads are Base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool. Two of them result
in plain DLL files (the others remain encrypted). The Regsvr32 tool is then used to load one
of the decoded DLLs, which in turn decrypts and loads other files until the final payload,
Astaroth, is injected into the Userinit process.

Figure 2. Astaroth “living-off-the-land” attack chain showing multiple legitimate tools abused
It’s interesting to note that at no point during the attack chain is any file run that’s not a
system tool. This technique is called living off the land: using legitimate tools that are already
present on the target system to masquerade as regular activity.
The attack chain above shows only the Initial Access and Execution stages. In these stages,
the attackers used fileless techniques to attempt to silently install the malware on target
devices. Astaroth is a notorious information stealer with many other post-breach capabilities
that are not discussed in this blog. Preventing the attack in these stages is critical.

Despite its use of “invisible” techniques, the attack chain runs under the scrutiny of Microsoft
Defender ATP. Multiple advanced technologies at the core of Windows Defender Antivirus
expose these techniques to spot and stop a wide range of attacks.
These protection technologies stop threats at first sight, use the power of the cloud, and
leverage Microsoft’s industry-leading optics to deliver effective protection. This defense-indepth is observed in the way these technologies uncovered and blocked the attack at
multiple points in Astaroth’s complex attack chain.

Figure 3. Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus solutions for fileless techniques used by
Astaroth
For traditional, file-centric antivirus solutions, the only window of opportunity to detect this
attack may be when the two DLLs are decoded after being downloaded—after all, every
executable used in the attack is non-malicious. If this were the case, this attack would pose a
serious problem: since the DLLs use code obfuscation and are likely to change very rapidly
between campaigns, focusing on these DLLs would be a vicious trap.

However, as mentioned, Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus catches fileless techniques.
Let’s break down the attack steps, enumerate the techniques used using MITRE technique
ID as reference, and map the relevant Microsoft Defender ATP protection.

Step 1: Arrival
The victim receives an email with a malicious URL:

The URL uses misleading names like certidao.htm (Portuguese for “certificate”),
abrir_documento.htm (“open document”), pedido.htm (“order”), etc.
When clicked, the malicious link redirects the victim to the ZIP archive certidao.htm.zip,
which contains a similarly misleading named LNK file certidao.htm.lnk. When clicked, the
LNK file runs an obfuscated BAT command-line.
MITRE techniques observed:
T1192 – Spearphishing Link
T1023 – Shortcut Modification
Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Command-line scanning: Trojan:Win32/BadEcho.A
Heuristics engine: Trojan:Win32/Linkommer.A
Windows Defender SmartScreen

Step 2: WMIC abuse, part 1
The BAT command runs the system tool WMIC.exe:

The use of the parameter /format causes WMIC to download the file v.txt, which is an XSL
file hosted on a legitimate-looking domain. The XSL file hosts an obfuscated JavaScript that
is automatically run by WMIC. This JavaScript code simply runs WMIC again.
MITRE techniques observed:
T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation
T1220 – XSL Script Processing
T1064 – Scripting
T1027 – Obfuscated Files Or Information
5/13

Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/WmiFormatXslScripting
AMSI integration engine: Trojan:JS/CovertXslDownload.

Step 3: WMIC abuse, part 2
WMIC is run in a fashion similar to the previous step:

WMIC downloads vv.txt, another XSL file containing an obfuscated JavaScript code, which
uses the Bitsadmin, Certutil, and Regsvr32 tools for the next steps.
MITRE techniques observed:
T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation
T1220 – XSL Script Processing
T1064 – Scripting
T1027 – Obfuscated Files Or Information
Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/WmiFormatXslScripting
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/WmicLoadDll.A
AMSI integration engine: Trojan:JS/CovertBitsDownload.C

Step 4: Bitsadmin abuse
Multiple instances of Bitsadmin are run to download additional payloads:

The payloads are Base64-encoded and have file names like: falxconxrenwb.~,
falxconxrenw64.~, falxconxrenwxa.~, falxconxrenwxb.~, falxconxrenw98.~,
falxconxrenwgx.gif, falxfonxrenwg.gif.
MITRE techniques observed:
T1197 – BITS Jobs
T1105 – Remote File Copy

6/13

Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/WmicBits.A

Step 5: Certutil abuse
The Certutil system tool is used to decode the downloaded payloads:

Only a couple of files are decoded to a DLL; most are still encrypted/obfuscated.
MITRE technique observed:
T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files Or Information
Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/WmiCertutil.A

Step 6: Regsvr32 abuse
One of the decoded payload files (a DLL) is run within the contexct of the Regsvr32 system
tool:

The file falxconxrenw64.~ is a proxy: it loads and runs a second DLL, falxconxrenw98.~, and
passes it to a third DLL that is obtained by reading files falxconxrenwxa.~ and
falxconxrenwxb.~. The DLL falxconxrenw98.~ then reflectively loads the third DLL.
MITRE techniques observed:
T1117 – Regsvr32
T1129 – Execution Through Module Load
T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files Or Information
Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/UserinitInject.B
Attack surface reduction: An attack surface reduction rule detects the loading of a
DLL that does not meet the age and prevalence criteria (i.e., a new unknown DLL)

Step 7: Userinit abuse
7/13

The newly loaded DLL reads and decrypts the file falxconxrenwgx.gif into a DLL. It runs the
system tool userinit.exe into which it injects the decrypted DLL. The file falxconxrenwgx.gif is
again a proxy that reads, decrypts, and reflectively loads the DLL falxconxrenwg.gif. This last
DLL is the malicious info stealer known as Astaroth.
MITRE techniques observed:
T1117 – Regsvr32
T1129 – Execution Through Module Load
T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files Or Information
Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus protection:
Behavior monitoring engine: Behavior:Win32/Astaroth.A
Attack surface reduction: An attack surface reduction rule detects the loading of a
DLL that does not meet the age and prevalence criteria (i.e., a new unknown DLL)

Comprehensive protection against fileless attacks with Microsoft
Threat Protection
The strength of Microsoft Defender ATP’s Antivirus engines in exposing fileless techniques
add to the capabilities of the unified endpoint protection platform. Activities related to fileless
techniques are reported in Microsoft Defender Security Center as alerts, so security
operations teams can further investigate and respond to attacks using endpoint detection
and response, advanced hunting, and other capabilities in Microsoft Defender ATP.

malware reported in Microsoft Defender Security Center; details also indicate whether threat
is remediated, as was the case with the Astaroth attack
The rest of Microsoft Defender ATP’s capabilities beyond Antivirus enable security
operations teams to detect and remediate fileless threats and other attacks. Notably,
Microsoft Defender ATP endpoint detection and response (EDR) has strong and durable

9/13

detections for fileless and living-off-the-land techniques across the entire attack chain.

techniques by antivirus and EDR capabilities
We also published a threat analytics report on living-off-the-land binaries to help security
operations assess organizational security posture and resilience against these threats. New
Microsoft Defender ATP services like threat and vulnerability management and Microsoft
Threat Experts (managed threat hunting), further assist organizations in defending against
fileless threats.
Through signal-sharing and orchestration of threat remediation across Microsoft’s security
technologies, these protections are further amplified in Microsoft Threat Protection,
Microsoft’s comprehensive security solution for the modern workplace. For this Astaroth
campaign, Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (Office 365 ATP) detects the emails with
malicious links that start the infection chain.
Microsoft Threat Protection secures identities, endpoints, email and data, apps, and
infrastructure.

Conclusion: Fileless threats are not invisible
To come back to one of my original points in this blog post, being fileless doesn’t mean being
invisible; it certainly doesn’t mean being undetectable.
An analogy: Pretend you are transported to the world of H.G. Wells’ The Invisible Man and
can render yourself invisible. You think, great, you can walk straight into a bank and steal
money. However, you soon realize that things are not as simple as they sound. When you
walk out in the open and it’s cold, your breath’s condensation gives away your position;
depending on the type of the ground, you can leave visible footmarks; if it’s raining, water
splashing on you creates a visible outline. If you manage to get inside the bank, you still
make noise that security guards can hear. Motion detection sensors can feel your presence,
and infrared cameras can still see your body heat. Even if you can open a safe or a vault,
these storage devices may trigger an alert, or someone may simply notice the safe opening.
Not to mention that if you somehow manage to grab the money and put them in a bag,
people are likely to notice a bag that’s walking itself out of the bank.
Being invisible may help you for some things, but you should not be under the illusion that
you are invincible. The same applies to fileless malware: abusing fileless techniques does
not put malware beyond the reach or visibility of security software. On the contrary, some of
12/13

the fileless techniques may be so unusual and anomalous that they draw immediate
attention to the malware, in the same way that a bag of money moving by itself would.
Using invisible techniques and being actually invisible are two different things. Using
advanced technologies, Microsoft Defender ATP exposes fileless threats like Astaroth before
these attacks can cause more damage.
