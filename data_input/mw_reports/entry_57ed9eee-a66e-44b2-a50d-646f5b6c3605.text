APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure

Introduction:
APT groups using COVID-19
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, upending
economies, livelihoods, schools and hospital systems—nearly every facet
of everyday life has been touched. Such uncertainty and fear surrounding
the virus and its impact represents a golden opportunity for threat actors
to exploit the situation. By using social engineering tactics such as spam
and spear phishing campaigns with COVID-19 as a lure, cybercriminals and
threat actors increase the likelihood of successful attack.
From late January on, several cybercriminal and statesponsored groups have been doing just that, using
coronavirus-themed phishing emails as their infection
vector to gain a foothold on victim machines. Just
like the coronavirus itself, China was the first target of
Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT) groups, and as the
virus spread worldwide, so did the cyberattacks.

In this paper, we provide an overview of several different
APT groups using coronavirus as a lure, as well as a
description of their varied attack vectors. We categorize
the APT groups according to the technique they used
to send spam or phishing emails: Template injection,
Malicious macros, RTF exploits, and malicious LNK files.

Once their victims’ attention was captured by social
engineering, threat actors used various techniques
to deploy malware, such as embedding macros in
Microsoft documents attached to phishing emails or
exploiting system or browser vulnerabilities to drop
malicious software.

Template injection
Template injection refers to a technique in which threat actors embed
a script moniker in the lure document—usually a Microsoft Office
document—that contains a link to a malicious Office template via an XML
setting. Upon opening the document, the remote template is dropped
and executed. Kimsuky and Gamaredon are examples of APTs using
template injection.
Kimsuky
Kimsuky (also known as Velvet Chollima) is a NorthKorean threat actor group that has been active since
2013 and is known to be behind the KHNP (Korea Hydro
& Nuclear Power) cyber terrorism attacks of 20141. The
group mainly targets Korean think tanks, DPRK/nuclearrelated targets, and several US firms with the main
goal of delivering malicious payloads to its targets and
stealing web application accounts.
Starting in early March 2020, Kimsuky began using
spear phishing emails with COVID-19 in the subject
line as its initial infection vector. The emails contain
malicious documents weaponized with CVE-2017-01992.
This vulnerability allows remote code execution by
exploiting a flaw in the Microsoft Office OLE interface to
deliver malware.
Upon opening the document, a prompt asks victims
to “enable content” to show information about the
coronavirus.

Figure 2: Malcious document after enabling content

After enabaling the content, a script moniker “in
word/_rels/setting[.]xml[.]rels” is triggered and drops a
Microsoft document template called web.dotm from the
following url:
http://crphone[.]mireene[.]com/plugin/editor/
Templetes/normal.php?name=web

Figure 3: setting.xml.rels content

Figure 1: Malicious document used as a lure

The “web.dotm” has an embedded macro which is designed to target Mac users (Figure 4). This macro also runs
on Windows OS, however, it only executes its main malicious functionality on a Mac. There is an “If statement” that
checks the operating system and executes a remote Python script called “Secured.APP”.

Figure 4: Malicious macro embedded in web.dotm

Figure 5 shows the content of “Secured.APP”, which executes the second stage Python script. Based on the
directory information provided in this script, it seems it is targeting users with Microsoft Office version 2016
or earlier.

Figure 5: Secured.APP

The second payload, as depicted in Figure 7, is spyware
that collects information by running several commands
and sending the collected data to its C&C server. The
main function is “SpyLoop”, which collects and sends
device/user information in an infinite while loop.
The list of collected information, stored in separate files
(Figure 6), is as follows:
• Architecture info
• System info
• Apple Pay
• Audio
• Bluetooth
• Camera
• External network info
• Firewall
• Hardware info
• Language and region
• List of running processes
• List of installed Applications
• List of files in Documents/Downloads/Desktop
directory
• List of volumes
• List of users

Figure 6: Content of collected information

The directory is then compressed with a password
(“doxujoijcs0qei09213@#$@”) and uploaded as a zip file
in an http request as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Second Python script

The next function in the loop is “ExecNewCommand”, which is likely used to download additional content. It then
sleeps for five minutes and repeats the same process. At time of writing, it only responded with a “200 OK”.

Gamaredon
Gamaredon is a Russian APT that primarily performs cyber espionage operations against Ukrainian military forces,
as well as individuals related to the Ukrainian government. Gamaredon has been active since 2013 and often uses
spear phishing as its initial infection vector.
Between March 23 and 25, Gamaredon sent phishing emails using the COVID-19 theme and employed remote
template injection within their lure, a Microsoft Word document written in Russian. (Figure 8).
Upon opening the document, a remote template is
dropped from the link provided in the XML setting
(Figure 9).
We were not able to retrieve this template at time of
publishing, but found other similar templates used by
this APT days before this campaign and realized they
are using similar malicious macros. Figure 10 shows an
example of such a macro.
Instead of executing the malicious behavior upon
opening the document (using the “auto_open” function),
the malicious macro in this document is executed in
the “Document_close” function. This could be to bypass
dynamic analysis if the document is not closed before
the sandbox times out.
The macro collects the computer name, home drive’s
label/serial number, and BIOS information (using WMI)
and sends it to a hardcoded C2 server with this format:
http://Server/ComputerName_DriveSerialNumber/
BiosVersionInfo

Figure 8: Lure document

Figure 9: Template injection

It then creates a VBS script in the %APPDATA% directory and makes it persistent by copying it into the startup
directory. In addition to the mentioned items, the script also collects keyboard layout and country code and checks
whether Process explorer or Wireshark are running on the system.

Figure 10: Macro embedded in template

The APT group then drops its custom backdoor “Pterodo” that is capable of downloading other malware variants
and collecting sensitive information3.

Malicious Macros
Embedding malicious macros is the most popular method of infection used
by APTs. In this attack vector, a macro is embedded in the lure document
that will be activated upon its opening. In the following sections, we look at
APTs using this method in their COVID-19 lure.
Kimsuky
In the previous section, we mentioned that Kimsuky is
using template injection to infect Mac users. We also
observed this actor using COVID-19-themed malicious
macros to target Windows users mostly in South Korea4.
(Figure 11):

Figure 11: Malicious document targeting Windows users

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 10

The malicious macro is obfuscated, as shown in Figure 12:

Figure 12: Malicious obfuscated macro

After de-obfuscating the script, we can see the value stored in the content variable as:

This uses “mshta” to execute a malicious search.hta file from its server. The content variable is then executed by
Wscript. The “Search.hta” contains a script that downloads another script. The downloaded script is spyware that
collects sensitive information, such as IP addresses, usernames, list of processes, RDP information, and Outlook
information and sends it back to the server.

Konni (APT37)
Konni is a North Korean APT that has been active since
2012 and is known to target South Korean organizations
in the chemicals, electronics, manufacturing,
aerospace, automotive, and healthcare industries. In
2017, the group expanded its operations, targeting
organizations in several other countries, such as the US,
Japan, Vietnam, Russia, Nepal, China, India, Romania,
Kuwait, and countries in the Middle East. Recently,
researchers found several communalities between this
APT and Kimsuky, showing there is a close tie between
these two groups5.

Figure 13 shows the lure document, named “Keep an
eye on North Korean cyber.doc”:

Konni is known to use spear phishing emails, strategic
web compromises, and torrent file-sharing sites to
compromise its victims. In mid-March, they began
sending spear phishes with COVID-19 warnings,
ironically advising readers to watch out for North Korean
cybercrime spikes related to the spread of the virus.

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 11

The embedded macro in this document includes an encrypted executable code that is XOR decoded and stored
in the “C\Users\UserName\” directory (Figure 14). The dropped executable is a downloader for their popular Konni
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) downloaded from6:
http://phpview[.]mygamesonline[.]org/3.dat

Figure 14: Embedded macro

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 12

APT36
APT36 is another threat group that has employed macro-embedded COVID-19 themes in their recent campaigns.
The group is believed to be Pakistani state-sponsored, mainly targeting the defense, embassies, and government
of India.7 Their coronavirus attacks began on March 12 and included phishing emails with attached malicious
documents, which dropped Crimson RAT payloads on victim machines.

Patchwork
Patchwork, also known as Dropping Elephant, Chinastrats, APT-C-09, and Quilted Tiger, is an Indian threat actor
that has been active since 2013. The primary targets of this APT are organizations related to diplomatic and
government agencies in China, Japan, the Middle East, the UK, the US, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.
Patchwork mainly uses spear phishing methods to gain access to victims’ machines.
In early February, Patchwork began sending phishing emails with a COVID-19 theme, using malicious Excel
documents to target Chinese organizations (Figure 15).

Figure 15: Lure document

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 13

The embedded macro (Figure 17) is simple: It downloads a script from the URL embedded as a formula in column
“X”, row “100”. (Figure 16).

Figure 16: Url embedded in the cell

Figure 17: Macro

The downloaded Scriptlet “window.scr” (Figure 18) is responsible for dropping and executing another payload,
which is a custom backdoor developed by the actor.

Figure 18 window.scr

Hades
Hades is the APT group behind the attack against the
Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Evidence suggests
that this group is connected to the well-known Russian
threat actor APT288.
In their recent campaign called Tricky Mouse, Hades
targeted Ukrainian users using COVID-19 lures9, 10.
The attack started by sending a macro-embedded
document to victims (Figure 19).
The embedded macro (Figure 20) decodes and drops a
RAT executable into the victim’s machine.

Figure 19: Hades lure document

Figure 20: Embedded macro

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 15

The RAT is dropped in the local user directory as “conhost.exe”. That RAT is a .NET executable obfuscated by
“Eazfuscator.net” (Figure 21):

Figure 21: Hades RAT

After de-obfuscation. we saw that the RAT had several functionalities, such as collecting system and user
information, taking screenshots, and logging keystrokes.
The “Kdaapk” module is responsible for performing C&C communications. The C&C URL is hardcoded within this
module as you can see in Figure 22:

Figure 22: Hades RAT after deobfuscation

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 16

TA505
TA505 is an APT group that started its activity by
distributing the Dridex banking Trojan on mass scale
in 201411. The group is considered unique, as it’s a
financially-motivated team of threat actors that uses a
wide variety of malware families.

As you can see in Figure 24, upon opening the
document, a progress bar dialog box pops up
(UserForm1_show). The dialog box is used to confuse the
user while the main malicious functionality is located in
the popped-up dialog box activate function (Figure 25).

Starting on March 9th, TA505 used malicious macros
in their COVID-19 themed documents, which included
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Figure 23 show such a
document after enabling its content:

Figure 23: Lure document

Figure 24: Embedded macro

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 17

When the dialog box is popped up, the “UserForm_
Activate()” function is executed, which calls
“Nlgebredneh()” function:

Figure 25: Trigger function of the dialog box

The “Nlgebredneh()” function drops “paper.xls” in the
“%APPDATA%” temp directory and extracts “oleobject1.
bin” from “paper.xls”. In the next step, it decrypts the
content of “oleobject1.bin” into “reinforce.dll” in the
“%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Templates” directory.
Finally, it executes the DLL file.

Figure 26: The “Nlgebredneh” function

The DLL file is a small downloader that decrypts the next
payload into memory. The downloader drops additional
malware families associated with TA505, such as
banking Trojans and RATs.

TA542

Ocean Lotus

TA542 (Mummy Spider) is a Russian-speaking threat
actor group behind the distribution of Emotet, which
was first seen in the wild in 201412. At first, TA542 used
modules from the Feodo banking Trojan, but over time
developed their malware with modular architecture
adding new capabilities.

APT32 (Ocean lotus, Sea Lotus) is a Vietnamese APT that
has been active since 2014.

Since the emergence of COVID-19, TA542 has started
using coronavirus themes in various email distribution
campaigns. Malicious documents distributed by the
actor have embedded macros that act as a downloader
for Emotet malware13.

Bitter
Bitter is suspected to be a south Asian APT group
targeting Pakistan and China since 201514. According
to other security researchers, this group has also used
COVID-19 themes to target China15. Macro-embedded
documents distributed by this group download and
drop a variant of its custom RAT that has been written
in .Net. Unfortunately, we were not able to retrieve any
sample related to this campaign.

The group has targeted private sectors as well as
governments and journalists from Australia, Brunei,
Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US,
and Vietnam. Ocean Lotus has used strategic web
compromises and spear phishing to gain foothold into
victims’ machines16.
Ocean Lotus also used malicious macro-embedded
documents with COVID-19 themes to target China,
starting February 19. In this attack, the malicious
document dropped the “Denis” Trojan, a malware family
that has been developed by this group17.

RTF exploit
RTF is a flexible text format that was introduced by Microsoft a long time
ago. The flexibility of embedding any object type within makes RTF files
vulnerable to many OLE objects related vulnerabilities. Several threat
actors, especially Chinese ones, use RTF files in their campaigns. Among
them are the Calypso group and Winnti threat actors who have used RTF
files in their COVID-19 campaigns.
Calypso Group
Calypso is a Chinese APT group that has been
performing cyber espionage operations since 201618, 19.
The group has targeted governments in Brazil, India,
Kazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, Belarus, Mongolia, and
Turkey.
In the new campaign, called Vicious Panada, Calypso
Group has targeted the Mongolian public sector by
sending malicious RTF files to victims disguised as
COVID-19 related documents20.

In this campaign, the RTF file exploits the equation
editor vulnerability to drop “intel.wll” into the “AppData/
Roaming/Microsoft/Word/STARTUP/” directory (Figure
27). “intel.wll” is then executed each time the Microsoft
Word application is launched. This DLL downloads
additional payloads, including a backdoor with several
capabilities, such as taking screen shots, executing new
processes, or collecting system information.

The RTF file has been weaponized with the Royal Road
RTF weaponization tool. The tool is known to be used by
several Chinese actors and has the capability to embed
objects within RTF files that exploit vulnerabilities
related to Microsoft Equation Editor. (CVE-2017-11882,
CVE-2018-0798, CVE-2018-0802)21.

Figure 28: RTF file embedding k.dll

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 20

Looking at the Equation Native Stream, we can see that
this DLL is made persistent by using the run registry key
“Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” (Figure 29).
In this case, “k.dll” is executed each time the system
reboots.

Figure 29: Equation native stream

A code similarity check between “k.dll” and “intel.wll”
showed that both have similar functionalities and the
same exported function named “Engdic”.

Chinese actor (Winnti)
Another Chinese threat actor that used the Royal Road
weaponization framework with a COVID-19 theme
recently dropped a backdoor variant named Chinoxy by
exploiting the equation editor vulnerability22, 23. Some
evidence suggests that Winnti is the actor behind this
campaign, but we cannot confirm it22, 24, 25.

Malicious LNK files
LNK files are shortcut files used by Microsoft Windows. They are considered
a Shell item type that can be executed. From 2013 on, attackers have
used malicious LNK files to infect their victims. A few APTs started using
malicious LNK with COVID-19 themes from late February to mid-March to
ensnare victims.
Mustang Panada
Mustang Panda is a Chinese threat actor that has
targeted NGOs (non-government organizations) since
2017. The group’s main targets are US think tanks and
NGO organizations in Mongolia. Mustang Panda uses
spear phishing emails to initiate its attacks and usually
drops either Poison Ivy or the PlugX RAT26, 27.
In their COVID-19 phishing campaign, Mustang Panda
sent an LNK file containing a malicious HTA application,
which contained a VB script (Figure 30).

Figure 30: HTA file

APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure 22

In the properties of this LNK file, there is a command that will be executed when the file is opened (Figure 31).

Figure 31: Command

The command calls “mshta.exe” to execute the HTA application that drops and runs a payload. The payload has a
resource that is dropped in the victim’s machine. The final payload in this campaign is either a variant of PlugX RAT
or Cobalt Strike.

Higaisia
Anomali has reported another threat group called Higaisia using malicious LNK files to perform malicious
operations using COVID-19 themes. The actor sends an LNK file disguised as a PDF via spam campaigns. After
opening the LNK file, an actual PDF file is opened28.
It is assumed that the group behind this campaign is a North Korean actor targeting English speaking people/
organizations28.
Opening the LNK file leads to execution of the command embedded in the property section (Figure 32). The
command decodes an embedded base64 payload and drops it into the victim’s machine.

Figure 32: Command

The dropped payload is a cabinet file that contains multiple files. The content of the cabinet file is extracted using
the legitimate Windows executable “extract.exe”. From there, multiple stages are executed and finally, a variant of
the PlugX RAT is dropped.

Conclusion
In this report, we provided an overview of various APT groups using the
COVID-19 pandemic as a theme in several different types of malicious
campaigns to increase the odds of their attacks’ success. This shows that
threat actors are closely monitoring public events happening around
the world, and quickly employing those themes in attack vectors to take
advantage of the opportunity.
We expect that in the coming weeks and months, APT threat actors will continue to leverage this crisis to craft
phishing campaigns using social engineering techniques and other malicious tactics embedded into lure
documents to compromise their targets.
