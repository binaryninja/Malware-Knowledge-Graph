Protecting VSAT Communications
VSAT communications are at risk
Commercial Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) networks are increasingly used for
remote communications in support of U.S. government missions. Due to the nature of
VSAT network communication links and recent vulnerabilities discovered in VSAT
terminals, network communications over these links are at risk of being exposed and
may be targeted by adversaries for the sensitive information they contain or to
compromise connected networks. Most of these
NSA recommends:
links are unencrypted, relying on frequency

separation or predictable frequency hopping
 Segmenting and encrypting
rather than encryption to separate

communications. Public vulnerability research has
 Updating equipment and
found certain terminal equipment vulnerable to
firmware
compromise and illicit firmware modification [1].
NSA recommends that VSAT networks enable any available transmission security
(TRANSEC) protections, segment and encrypt network communications before
transmitting across the VSAT links, and keep VSAT equipment and firmware up to date.
Recent Russian cyber activity in Ukraine further underscores the risk to VSAT
communications for both espionage and disruption. According to a recent U.S. and
European Union statements, the Russian military launched cyber attacks in late
February against commercial satellite communications networks to disrupt Ukrainian
command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into
other European countries. The activity disabled very small aperture terminals in Ukraine
and across Europe, including tens of thousands of terminals outside of Ukraine that,
among other things, support wind turbines and provide Internet services to private
citizens [2].

Encrypt network communications over VSAT links
VSAT systems (including terminals, modems, and ground stations) should be treated as
unencrypted wireless networks for cybersecurity purposes. In other words, they should
not be relied on to provide confidentiality from motivated cyber actors. Although they
offer "virtual" network separation capabilities, such logical isolation cannot be trusted to

provide access control, separation, or confidentiality of sensitive information. Further,
many of these networks can be gateways to the Internet, making them easy targets for
remote exploitation. When using VSAT networks—as with any other untrusted transport
network—information should first be secured using network encryption solutions to
achieve confidentiality and protect against malicious cyber activity. According to US
policy, controlled unclassified information (CUI) should be encrypted with commercial
network encryption solutions, such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) or Transport
Layer Security virtual private networks (TLS VPNs) first. Depending on network needs,
many solutions exist to provide scalable encryption links.
Point-to-point communications over otherwise unencrypted IP-based networks may
utilize (in accordance with NIST SP 800-131A rev2 and SP 800-56A rev3 guidance)
IKE/IPsec-encrypted VPNs using certificates or pre-shared keys to authenticate peers
and a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange of at least 3072 bits or Elliptic Curve DH
(ECDH) keys of 384 bits or larger (groups 14, 15, 16, 19, or 20) [3]. Point-to-point
communications for National Security Systems should conform to CNSSP 15 standards
[2]. Pre-shared keys should not be used with aggressive mode and should be protected
from unauthorized disclosure. These IPsec VPNs provide mutual authentication to both
ends of the VPN and protect the confidentiality of the data in transit. Similar
cryptographic algorithms should be employed for TLS-based VPNs. Multipoint
encrypted VPNs may be appropriate in architectures where many point-to-point VPNs
are unmanageable. Examples of commercial multipoint VPN products include Cisco ®
GET VPN, Cisco FlexVPN (previously known as DMVPN), and Juniper® Auto Discovery
VPN (ADVPN).
Encrypted VPN solutions protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of network
traffic before passing it over the VSAT link. NSA recommends using mutually
authenticated, encrypted TRANSEC. The encryption should be applied down to and
including the outermost vendor-proprietary transmission protocol, using an NSAapproved cryptographically generated pseudorandom key stream (AES 256) and key
management scheme.
Best practice guidance on using commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) is that
network owners not use descriptive naming conventions and identifiers in SATCOM and
mobile communications device configurations. This can complicate identification of
devices and network topologies by external actors to understand their purposes.

Additional VSAT best practices
NSA recommends keeping all IT equipment up to date. VSAT equipment is no
exception [4]. Networking equipment is increasingly becoming a target for malware, and
the vulnerabilities above suggest that VSAT terminals and network infrastructure could
be targeted like other networking technologies. Avoiding direct Internet access can
reduce the attack surface, but should not be seen as a substitute for closing known
terminal equipment vulnerabilities through software and firmware updates. Device
updates and upgrades should be acquired from trusted, known-good sources.
In addition, VSAT systems utilize vendor-specific default credentials, which are
published in user manuals; these passwords can enable root access to VSAT network
management systems. NSA recommends changing all default credentials.
VSAT networks are designed for high-availability connections with sometimes little in
terms of default authentication measures. Due to this, NSA recommends that VSAT
networks be segmented with approved firewalls and other similar technology. This
segmentation should isolate the management plane of the network, such as the network
management system, so that it is not accessible by remote VSAT modems apart from
vendor-identified ports and protocols.

Worldwide connectivity
Commercial VSAT technologies provide valuable, worldwide connectivity options,
enabling multiple mission types when more robust options are unavailable or
impractical. Users of such networks should ensure that data transmissions are
encrypted, adopt network hygiene best practices, and seek to continuously monitor the
VSAT network for unauthorized activity. Users should consider possible threats and the
associated mission impacts when selecting SATCOM solutions.▪
