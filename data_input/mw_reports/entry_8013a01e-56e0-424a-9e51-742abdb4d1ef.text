Unknown attacker using previously undocumented toolset targets
defense, healthcare, and ICT sectors.
An espionage campaign using a previously undocumented toolset has targeted a range of
organizations in South East Asia. Among the identified targets are organizations in the
defense, healthcare, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors. The
campaign appears to have begun in September 2020 and ran at least until May 2021.
The toolset used by the attackers includes loaders, a modular backdoor, a keylogger, and an
exfiltration tool designed to abuse cloud storage service Dropbox.

Attacker toolbox
The initial infection vector employed by the attackers remains unknown. The earliest sign of
attempted compromise is a loader that decrypts and loads a payload from a .dat file. At least
two different file names have been observed for the .dat file: sdc-integrity.dat and scsintegrity.dat. The loader also calls the DumpAnalyze export from the decrypted payload.
The payload has yet to be identified but is almost certainly a modular backdoor. This can be
inferred from one of the modules identified. This "Orchestrator" module points to the
existence of a separate DLL module that exposes at least 16 functions, as well as the
existence of a custom binary command and control (C&C) protocol used by Orchestrator but
implemented separately.
This module appears to be a core component of the backdoor. It runs as a Windows service
and a large part of its functionality is implemented in a separate DLL that is loaded from
registry (located in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.z\OpenWithProgidsEx\
<value_name_resolved_at_runtime>).
The module is expected to export the following functions:
Construct
ConnectHost1
ForceCloseSocket
Accept
Recv
RecvEx
Send
SendEx
BindShell
TransmitData_htran
KillChildenProcessTree (sic)

GetPseudoSocketInfo
Decrypt_ByteToByte
The module loads a configuration either from a file
(CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\Keys.dat) or from the registry
(HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.z\OpenWithProgidsEx\CONFIG). The configuration is encrypted.
The module uses the function Decrypt_ByteToByte from the separate DLL to decrypt the
configuration. The configuration is expected to contain the following options (stored in XML
format):
FLAG
Ip
Dns
CntPort
LstPort
Blog
DropboxBlog
SvcName
SvcDisp
SvcDesc
SvcDll
OlPass
OlTime
SelfDestroy
The module also uses the hardcoded mutex name, Global\QVomit4.
Other tools used in the campaign include a keylogger, which shows signs of being authored
by the same developer, sharing unique strings with other tools and string obfuscation
techniques. The attackers also used 7zr, a legitimate tool that is a lightweight version of the
7-Zip archiver, in addition to a data-exfiltration tool that sends stolen data to Dropbox.

Possible false flags
The nature of the targets and the tools used have all the hallmarks of an espionage
operation. Symantec has yet to attribute the attacks to a known actor and it appears that the
attackers took some steps to complicate attribution. For example, it is not clear what
language the group speaks and samples of the backdoor module found contained strings in
what appeared to be both Cyrillic and Urdu scripts.

3/5

The only potential clue found to date is that one of the organizations attacked was also
targeted by a tool used by the China-linked Leafhopper group (aka APT30) during the same
time period. However, there is no evidence as yet to tie the tool to this campaign.
