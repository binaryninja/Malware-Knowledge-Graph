Summary
Description
This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North
Korean government. This malware variant is known as SHARPKNOT. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North
Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean
government.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced
mitigation.
This malware report contains analysis of a malicious 32-bit Windows executable file. When executed from the command line, the malware
overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) and deletes files on the local system, any mapped network shares, and physically connected
storage devices.
The following Yara rule can be used to detect this malware:

Description
This file is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable. Analysis indicates the primary purpose of this application is to destroy a compromised
Windows system by overwriting and deleting the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the victim's system and deleting files on network mapped
shares as well as physically attached storage devices.
The malware must be executed from a command line using any alphanumeric character or string as an argument. Once executed, the
malware first attempts to disable the "System Event Notification" and "Alerter" services (Figure 1).
Note: The Alerter service is present in Windows XP and Windows 2003, which are no longer supported by Microsoft. Current operating
systems supported by Microsoft do not run the Alerter service.
Next, the malware overwrites the MBR, displaying a status in the command (CMD) window. If the malware is able to overwrite the MBR, an
"OK" status is displayed in the CMD window. If the malware is unable to overwrite the MBR, a "Fail" status is displayed.
After the MBR is overwritten, the malware attempts to gain access to physical and network drives attached to the victim's system and
recursively enumerate through the drive’s contents. When the malware identifies a file, it overwrites the file's contents with NULL bytes,
renames the file with a randomly generated file name (Figure 2), then deletes the file, making forensic recovery impossible.
If the malware is able to overwrite, rename and delete the file, the CMD window will display a “Break>" status. If the malware is only able to
delete the file, the CMD window will display a “Del>" status (Figure 3).
Once the malware has completed deleting files, the system is rebooted. If the malware has executed successfully, the system is rendered
inoperative.

Recommendations
NCCIC would like to remind users and administrators of the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's
systems:
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the
file header).
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats; implement appropriate ACLs.
