Additionally, Emotet malware, Ryuk ransomware, and related infections caused business
disruptions to multiple industrial and related
entities. Although not specifically targeted to
ICS, such attacks demonstrate how commodity malware, sometimes limited to IT networks
only, impacts operations especially when there
is interconnectivity on the operations technology (OT) networks that is not fully understood,
documented, or hardened.

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

R EC O M M E N DATIONS
Dragos recommends
implementing a riskbased and ICS-specific
cybersecurity program,
which may leverage
existing engineering and
corporate resources.

Such a program should evaluate the potential impact of an ICS-disruptive cybersecurity incident
and include ICS-specific monitoring, threat detection, and response. Traditional, and even modern,
information technology (IT) enterprise approaches
are insufficient to defend an industrial environment.

UNDERSTAND AND ANTICIPATE
THREAT PROLIFERATION
Due to the increasing proliferation of threats, asset
owners and operators across all industries must
be aware of threats to ICS. As evidenced by XENOTIME and MAGNALLIUM, activity groups that
historically target one vertical can expand their
focus at any time.

CONDUCT OSINT ASSESSMENTS
Dragos has observed adversaries including
XENOTIME accessing publicly available data that
support disruptive attacks. Asset owners and
operators are encouraged to conduct regular
open source intelligence (OSINT) assessments.
Users should identify and limit information
available about vendors and partners; documents,
schematics, and data sheets; job advertisements;
and credentials in public dumps. Security teams
should also identify gaps in security architecture
such as remote login portals that lack strong
passwords and multi-factor authentication.
Additionally, users should proactively identify
scanning or automated information scraping
activity and implement mechanisms to prevent
automation such as requiring CAPTCHA or an
email address to download public documentation.
Ensure all employees limit exposure of sensitive
information, such as employment data on LinkedIn,
that could facilitate targeting operations.

DEPLOY ICS-SPECIFIC
MONITORING AND THREAT
DETECTION

Every year this becomes more and more evident. If
you don’t see it, you can’t respond to it. If you don’t
know you have it, you don’t know how to protect
it. These are the basic axioms of monitoring and
detection forming the basis of any defensible
environment. ICS environments provide unique
assets, configurations, processes, data, protocols,
and many other distinctive characteristics that
significantly hamper traditional IT enterprise
products from performing effectively. It is
insufficient to use an “IT” approach to achieve ICS
defensibility.
Asset owners and operators should monitor for
potentially malicious behaviors within the ICS, such
as monitoring for callouts to the internet or internetroutable IP addresses, new account creation, new
devices on the network, and configuration changes
outside of change windows.

THE HUMAN AND

SAFE TY
COM P O NENT
As geopolitical tensions continue
to increase, Dragos anticipates
a corresponding increase in
cybersecurity activity directed
towards critical infrastructure and
industrial entities.

Following escalatory messages over the summer between
the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, Dragos identified an
uptick in malicious activity against ICS.9 Indeed, Dragos first
identified MAGNALLIUM targeting electric utilities between
July and August 2019, coinciding with heightened tensions in
the Middle East.
Dragos anticipates ICS-targeting activities will continue, and
that such activities can put human life at risk.

TH RE ATS
I N D E TA I L

Threats to ICS are increasing in sophistication and number. In
2019, through intelligence gathering, information sharing, and
incident response engagements, Dragos identified a variety
of new and ongoing threats to ICS. The following are the most
concerning to Dragos.

9

PROLIFERATION OF
THREATS
Cyber threats to ICS are proliferating as adversaries increasingly invest money, time, and talent into the ability to disrupt
critical infrastructure. Such targets include oil and gas, electric
power, and water.

10

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

Disruptive or destructive attacks on critical infrastructure require significant resources, which
are increasing across the board as capabilities
and targeting expand. The proliferation of cyber
threats to ICS can be illustrated by the activity
groups XENOTIME and MAGNALLIUM.
In 2019, Dragos identified a change in behavior for XENOTIME, the activity group behind
the destructive TRISIS malware. While working
with clients across various utilities and regions,
Dragos identified a persistent pattern of activity
attempting to gather information and enumerate network resources associated with US and
Asia-Pacific electric utilities.10 XENOTIME expanded its probing activity to include electric
utilities, using the same techniques previously
deployed against oil and gas entities. Additionally, as identified in previous Dragos reporting,
XENOTIME has targeted, and in some cases
successfully compromised, original equipment

manufacturers (OEMs), potentially impacting
the entire industrial supply chain.11
Also this year, Dragos identified MAGNALLIUM beginning to target electric, financial, and
government entities in North America. This behavior coincided with an escalation of political
and geographic tensions in the Middle East over
the summer.12 The activity demonstrated an expansion of the behavior for the group previously
focused on oil and gas entities, largely in or relating to operations in the Middle East.

It is important to note this behavior is not a
shift – rather it is an expansion of targeting
for two groups historically focused on the
oil and gas sector. This means that all ICS
entities must be aware of malicious activity
and adversary behaviors across industrial
sectors as interest and targeting from any
group could change.

Leverage ICS-specific threat
intelligence to become knowledgeable about adversary

DISRUPTIVE MALWARE,
RANSOMWARE, AND
SABOTAGE
DR AGOS HAS IDENTIFIED AN UPTICK IN MALWARE
INFECTIONS, PARTICUL ARLY R ANSOMWARE, AT
INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES GLOBALLY. LIK E IN 2018,
DISRUPTIVE IT MALWARE WAS AGAIN A THRE AT
TO ICS ENTITIES IN 2019.
This year the major malware
families and events included
LockerGoga, Emotet, and Ryuk
infections. Additionally, Dragos
identified an increase in new
IT-based wiper malware activity targeting industrial entities
in the Middle East. Dragos has
also responded to ransomware
events impacting ICS environments, underscoring the
potential threat to operations
from IT-focused malware if it
breaches IT/OT boundaries.

The LockerGoga variant likely used at Hydro encrypted
all files outside the Windows
directory, instead of just files
with typical document extensions. The Hydro variant also
implemented various changes
to make restoration difficult, if
not impossible. Thus, Dragos
classified LockerGoga as a
destructive malware type used
for sabotage instead of mere
ransomware.
Superficially,
this is similar to the NotPetya

ransomware event from June
2017, where malware appearing to be ransomware actually
resulted in system loss due to
the inability to recover files.15
Emotet first appeared toward
the end of 2018, infecting
multiple ICS-related entities.
Throughout 2019, it continued
to affect businesses, with a
brief drop-off over the summer.16 Emotet is a modular
trojan commonly observed
deploying Trickbot and Ryuk
malware. In February 2019,
Emotet malware infected a
deep draft vessel bound for
the Port of New York and New
Jersey which impacted their
shipboard network (though no
essential control systems were
impacted) according to the US
Coast Guard.17 Ryuk affected
multiple organizations associated with the aviation industry.

Additionally, Mitsubishi Canada Aerospace experienced a Ryuk ransomware attack beginning on
March 19 and lasting “weeks,” according to local
media.18 Ryuk also impacted an unspecified marine
facility, disrupting its camera and physical access
control systems, as well as causing a loss of critical process control monitoring systems, according
to a December bulletin from the US Coast Guard.19
In June, UK’s National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC) warned of ongoing Ryuk ransomware
campaigns targeting global organizations. Then in
October, the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) released an
advisory on a widespread malicious email campaign to spread Emotet malware in Australia. The
Australian government received dozens of reports
of confirmed Emotet infections in sectors including
critical infrastructure providers and government
agencies. The ACSC said it was aware of at least
19 Emotet infections in Australia, some of which
deployed the Trickbot malware.20
Numerous other malware events disrupted ICS
entities in 2019. In July, a ransomware attack on
the IT systems at Johannesburg, South Africa’s
City Power prevented prepaid electricity purchase
via online systems, and prevented customers who
had previously bought power to load it to their meter boxes; 21 in September, Rheinmetall Automotive
experienced an unnamed malware attack that
disrupted some production processes; 22 also that
month, a cyber event disrupted production and

distribution at Danish health device manufacturer
Demant; 23 BitPaymer ramsomware impacted order
fulfillment and delivery at the automation firm Pilz
in October; 24 and oil company Petroleos Mexicanos
experienced a ransomware attack in November
that disrupted the company’s administration, business, billing, and supply chain operations.25
Government and intelligence organizations frequently publish detailed information on threats to
businesses and citizens alike, providing some valuable visibility into threat trends in various countries.
However, such releases provide a limited view of
malicious activity. Dragos performed incident
response cases against a number of IT-focused
malware infections at industrial organizations, including a Sodinokibi ransomware infection at an
ICS entity that disabled multiple systems required
for control of the affected plant. Such events often
go unreported in the public sphere, thus Dragos’
incident response capabilities and intelligence
collection generate additional insights into threat
trends like disruptive ransomware.
2019 also saw two new IT-based wiper malware
strains targeting energy entities in the Middle
East. Dragos discovered KILLGRAVE malware associated with operations against the oil and gas
industry in the UAE in July 2019, with likely links
to the MAGNALLIUM activity group. Additionally, in
December, IBM released public details on a wiper
called ZeroCleare targeting unspecified industrial
and energy environments in the Middle East.26 Dragos continues to observe evidence of ZeroCleare
use and related variants in the wild.

ENTITIES THIS YE AR. IN 2019, NE W THRE ATS EMERGED AFFECTING
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERS (MSPS),
AND BACK BONE INTERNE T SERVICE PROVIDERS.
Dragos identified the new activity group HEXANE targeting telecommunications entities in
addition to oil and gas in Africa, the Middle East,
and Southwest Asia. Additionally, Microsoft 27
and security firm Cybereason28 published
reports on threat actors targeting telecommunications providers globally.
Telecommunications networks are valuable
targets for ICS-targeting attackers. Gaining
access to a mobile or satellite network could allow an adversary to interact with upstream and
midstream operations that utilize cellular devices or satellite connections for communication,
monitoring, and management. Geographically
dispersed and remote operations – such as
pipeline compressor stations and offshore oil
wells, or solar or wind farms – often depend on
cellular or satellite communication networks.
Dragos observed ICS-specific targeting via

telecommunications networks indicating activity corresponding to initial access attempts,
or Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain, trying to
bridge to Stage 2 capabilities or access.29
In April, media reporting indicated business process and information technology outsourcing
firm Wipro, which provides services for various
ICS verticals, allegedly suffered a breach of
corporate systems.30 Adversaries then used
this access to launch follow-on attacks against
Wipro clients. Although not directly involved in
industrial operations, Wipro products and services – such as the company’s Promax offering
– are often tied to industrial processes for
data collection, processing, and analysis.31 The
breach was one of multiple third-party service
provider attacks Dragos and other entities have
identified since 2017, highlighted in Dragos’
2018 Year in Review reporting.32

14

External parties routinely have access to operations,
and thus it presents an issue where third-party access
bypasses corporate IT. Multiple related services surrounding
ICS operations – from managing corporate IT through
performing data collection and analysis on industrial
processes – rely on trusted third parties deeply integrated
into the organization’s operations.

RECOMMENDED
SECURITY
IMPROVEMENT

In April, Cisco Talos revealed a sophisticated DNS
hijacking campaign called Sea Turtle.33 It targeted
40 organizations in 13 countries, primarily national security organizations in the Middle East and
North Africa, and compromised victims included
“prominent energy organizations.” The goal of the
campaign was to steal credentials to access the
primary victims’ networks. The attacks began as
early as January 2017 and continued through this
year.

Indeed, Dragos has identified at least one ICStargeting activity group targeting vulnerable
VPN appliances, and security researchers
identified active exploitation of the Windows
vulnerability. In 2019, Dragos also responded
to cyber events in which adversaries used RDP
connections as a means to obtain initial access.
In May, Microsoft published an advisory detailing
a critical vulnerability in Remote Desktop
Services which could allow an attacker to send
a specially crafted packet to a target system via
RDP and achieve control of the system.34 The
vulnerability is known as “BlueKeep” or CVE2019-0708 and affects Windows 7, Windows
Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows
2003 and Windows XP. If an attacker utilizes

the target network in

fashion.
Microsoft said in its initial
advisory the vulnerability
could enable a malware
outbreak similar to the
WannaCry attacks in 2017.

In November, researchers
revealed attackers actively
exploiting vulnerability to
install cryptocurrency mining malware on victim
machines.35 This is a relatively low impact
exploitation of the vulnerability considering the
scale and scope of potential consequences. It
is likely attackers will continue to exploit this
vulnerability, with potentially more disruptive
effects. The RDP vulnerability is concerning
to ICS asset owners and operators. ICS
environments often contain older versions
of Windows operating systems on devices
including human machine interfaces (HMIs),
data historians, and OPC servers. It is especially
concerning for DMZ jump hosts, which may
have exposure to corporate networks and would
be the initial ICS entry point for any future worm
which uses this vulnerability.

16

RDP access is a valuable entry point for attackers, even if
patched against this vulnerability but not properly defended.
In the Sodinokibi ransomware event mentioned above,
Dragos incident responders observed that attackers remotely
compromised a plant by brute forcing RDP access. That
is, an adversary tried numerous passwords against the
victim’s RDP endpoint which was exposed to the internet and
eventually guessed correctly.

Adversaries are also targeting vulnerable VPN
appliances for initial access to target networks.
Dragos identified PARISITE targeting known vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure Pulse Connect Secure
(CVE-2019-11510), 36 Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Portal (CVE-2019-1579), 37 and Fortinet
FortiOS (CVE-2018-13379)38 VPN applications.
Dragos identified that the identified activity began
as early as April 2019. The exploited vulnerabilities
could allow remote attackers to take control of a
vulnerable system. Details of the vulnerabilities
were published earlier this year, and government
intelligence agencies previously said multiple adversaries are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities
worldwide.39
VPN gateways are common targets for adversaries as they can provide outside access to internal
networks and may lack some security protection mechanisms prevalent inside a perimeter.
Third-party services often use VPNs to connect
with customers for things like business or maintenance purposes thus making them a valuable
target for adversaries aiming to take advantage of
trusted relationships.

RECOMMENDED
SECURITY
IMPROVEMENT
If possible, do not allow direct access from the internet. Exposing
RDP could allow for attackers to
bypass a network’s security stack.
Enforce multifactor authentication
on all remote services.

Enterprise VPN clients are often used for remote
access from IT to OT environments. Dragos has
previously reported on adversaries that have shown
interest in VPN services, including XENOTIME.
Additionally, a September 2019 report described
a series of cyberattacks that targeted Airbus via
VPN connections between the company and its
suppliers reportedly with the intention to steal
commercial information and intellectual property.40 Dragos observes that similar techniques can
be used for other disruptive or destructive ICS-specific cyber incidents.

17

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

COMMON TACTICS REMAIN EFFECTIVE
ICS-TARGE TING ADVERSARIES CONTINUE TO USE COMMON
AND POPUL AR TACTICS TO ACHIE VE INITIAL ACCESS.

In June, Dragos identified MAGNALLIUM using brute
force password spraying techniques against oil and
gas entities in the US, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific
region, a new method of initial access for this group.
The group implemented the same technique against
additional energy companies including electric
utilities in the following months. Password spraying
refers to adversaries targeting large numbers of
accounts using common passwords to perform
large-scale authentication attempts.
Although password spraying is
a relatively common technique
attackers use to gain access to
enterprise resources, organizations are often vulnerable to
these types of attacks because
of poor account management
and authentication policies for
external resources.
MAGNALLIUM also remained
faithful to its often-observed
phishing
behavior.
MAGNALLIUM frequently uses
job-themed phishing lures,
largely focused in the Middle
East. However, in June and

November, Dragos identified
MAGNALLIUM phishing campaigns using North American
job-themed phishing lures; this
change in phishing behavior
aligned with shifts in targeting for other MAGNALLIUM
activity, including password
spraying as mentioned above.
Throughout the year, Dragos
observed watering hole activity associated with DYMALLOY
and
ALLANITE.

can be a useful phishing route for an adversary
as it can bypass email security filters and attackers can leverage users’ network connections to
appear as a legitimate contact.
Finally, in July and August, Dragos observed a
phishing campaign by an unknown adversary that
utilized traditional email phishing messages mimicking engineering entities to deliver “LookBack”
malware to electric utilities. Dragos collaborated with our intelligence sharing partners to
learn more about the campaign’s targeting, and
Dragos identified adversary infrastructure,
including domains spoofing major engineering
standards bodies and a utility regulator. The
messages specifically targeted electric utilities
in the US. Security firm Proofpoint published
public details on the campaign. 41

Although common enterprise
tactics remain effective, adversaries are moving towards
ICS specific capabilities. Environmental context is key to
threat detection; for instance,
the difference between lateral movement in a DMZ or
lateral movement from an
engineering workstation to a
safety instrumented system
can make all the difference in
detection and response.
To that end, Dragos collaborated with MITRE on creating the
new ATT&CK for ICS 41 framework. It is designed to help
analysts, defenders, and other
security practitioners better
understand threat behaviors
affecting industrial environments and develop defensive
strategies. The existing and
widely used ATT&CK for Enterprise framework breaks down

common tactics, techniques,
and procedures observed
by numerous activity groups
and buckets them into separate fields like initial access,
command and control, and
lateral movement. Building on
the existing documentation,
Dragos and MITRE created a
framework specifically for ICS
to identify what behaviors and
methods we observe targeting
operations environments. New
categories specific to operations environments within the
ATT&CK for ICS framework
include inhibiting control or
response functions, and the
ultimate impact.
Some of the tactics and
visibility we have on ICS activity groups are detailed

Dragos categorizes behavior by activity group,42 creating
threat analytics that provide comprehensive data around
actions, capabilities, and intentions for our Dragos Platform
technology.

We report on these threats in our WorldView intelligence
reporting. We currently publicly label 11 ICS-focused activity
groups and track more unlabeled activity of interest. The
following summaries include newly identified activity groups
as well as recent activity that Dragos links with high confidence
to tracked activity groups.

Additionally, and unlike other activity groups
Dragos tracks, HEXANE also targeted telecommunication providers in the greater Middle
East, Central Asia, and Africa, potentially as a
steppingstone to network-focused man-in-themiddle* and related attacks.

* A “man-in-the-middle” attack describes an adversary surreptitiously compromising communications between two or more
parties and can be used to conduct espionage or disrupt or alter communications.

22

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

HEXANE intrusion activity includes malicious documents that
drop malware to establish footholds for follow-on activity.
Although the group appears operational since at least mid-2018,
activity accelerated in early- to mid-2019. This timeline, targeting,
and increase of operations coincides with an escalation of
tensions within Middle East, a current area of political and
military conflict.
HEXANE’s telecommunications targeting appears to follow a
trend demonstrated by other activity groups. ICS adversaries are
increasingly targeting third-party organizations along the supply
chains of potential targets. For instance, in 2018, Dragos identified
the activity group XENOTIME targeting several industrial original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and hardware and software
suppliers.

HEXANE demonstrates similarities to the activity groups
MAGNALLIUM and CHRYSENE, which are discussed below. These activity groups perform ICStargeting activities focused largely on oil and gas, and share some similar observed tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Like HEXANE, MAGNALLIUM also increased its activity in
early- to mid-2019. However, the collection of HEXANE behaviors, tools, and victimology makes
this a unique entity compared to these previously observed activity groups.

I C S AT T & C K M A P P I N G H I G H L I G H T
HEXANE uses User Interaction (T863) for Execution.
DEFINITION

Adversaries may rely on a targeted organizations’ user interaction for the
execution of malicious code. User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to
documents. Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code
into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers. Execution of this code requires that the user enable scripting or write
access within the document. Embedded code may not always be noticeable
to the user especially in cases of trojanized software.

IN CONTEXT

HEXANE used ICS-themed phishing lures targeting industrial entities which
required victims to enable macros to execute its malware.

Dragos identified PARISITE activity targeting ICS-related
entities using known VPN vulnerabilities.43 PARISITE’s
current focus of targeting vulnerable VPN appliances
indicates an interest in initial access to enterprise networks
in order to gain access to industrial networks.
PARISITE infrastructure and capabilities date from at least
2017, indicating operations since at least that time. PARISITE
uses known open source penetration testing tools for
reconnaissance and to establish encrypted communications.
This aligns with other activity groups increasingly using
publicly available tools and resources as opposed to
customized malware once achieving initial access.
At this time, PARISITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific
disruptive or destructive capability. Dragos intelligence
indicates PARISITE serves as the initial access group and
enables further operations for MAGNALLIUM.

I C S AT T & C K M A P P I N G H I G H L I G H T
PARISITE uses Exploitation of Remote Services (T866) for Lateral
Movement.
DEFINITION

Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of a
programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system
software or kernel itself to enable remote service abuse. A common goal for
post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to
enable access to a remote system.

IN CONTEXT

PARISITE exploits known vulnerabilities in VPN appliances for initial access
and lateral movement, specifically targeting ICS entities. Such access can
enable a foothold for establishing OT network compromise.

Initially focused on oil and gas entities largely
operating in the Middle East, MAGNALLIUM’s
expansion to additional industries in 2019
coincides with heightened tensions between
multiple countries in the Middle East.

26

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

This year Dragos observed MAGNALLIUM deploying password
spraying campaigns, a new initial access behavior for this group.
MAGNALLIUM also relies extensively on phishing, frequently
using job-themed lures to entice victims.
In July, Dragos identified a new disruptive malware dubbed
KILLGRAVE associated with MAGNALLIUM activity. The malware
targeted industrial entities in the Middle East and includes
various capabilities to disrupt or potentially destroy infected
systems depending on parameters. It represents a new threat
to industrial entities either through indirect disruption via IT
impacts, or direct disruption if attackers gain access to the ICS
environment. Dragos intelligence indicates this malware was
likely a coordination between MAGNALLIUM and PARISITE, with
the latter staging the malware via VPN gateway compromise and
MAGNALLIUM distributing it through the victim network.

energy firms and an aircraft holding company, the group continues to expand targeting across the
energy sector and related industries.

MAGNALLIUM’s Impact causes Loss of View (T829)
DEFINITION

Adversaries may cause a sustained or permanent loss of view where the ICS
equipment will require local, hands-on operator intervention; for instance, a
restart or manual operation. By causing a sustained reporting or visibility
loss, the adversary can effectively hide the present state of operations. This
loss of view can occur without affecting the physical processes themselves.

IN CONTEXT

MAGNALLIUM activity includes creating and deploying IT-centric wiper malware targeting industrial entities that has the ability to cause loss of view
within operations if the malware crosses the IT/OT boundary.

After further investigation, Dragos observed
WASSONITE tools and behaviors targeting
multiple industrial control system (ICS) entities
including electric generation, nuclear energy,
manufacturing, and organizations involved in
space-centric research. WASSONITE has been
active since at least 2018.

28

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

WASSONITE targeting focuses on Asian entities, largely in
India, as well as possibly Japan and South Korea. At this time,
WASSONITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive
or destructive capability. All the activity represents Stage 1 of the
ICS Kill Chain: access operations within IT networks.
WASSONITE operations rely on deploying DTrack malware for
remote access to victim machines, capturing credentials via
Mimikatz and publicly available tools, and utilizing system tools
to transfer files and move laterally within the enterprise system.
Researchers first disclosed DTrack in late September 2019, 45
and identified the tool targeting Indian financial institutions
and research centers. DTrack is loosely connected to an earlier
observed malware family, ATMDTrack, used for robbing ATM
machines.

WASSONITE uses Valid Accounts (T859) for Persistence
DEFINITION

Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account
using credential access techniques. In some cases, default credentials for
control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials
may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on
hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access
to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an
adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to
restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware
or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide,
to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send
legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create
accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to
provide a means of backup access for persistence.

IN CONTEXT

WASSONITE captures and re-uses legitimate credentials to establish persistence within victim networks. Such behaviors can be deployed to facilitate
access to OT environments and control system devices.

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

Available data indicates XENOTIME relies on capturing legitimate
system credentials to move throughout the target network while
deploying a combination of legitimate Windows utilities and
custom-developed tools. Evidence suggests that unique tools
associated with XENOTIME have been in development since
2014.
Dragos has also observed entities associated with XENOTIME
experimenting with the Cobalt Strike penetration testing
framework. This follows the previously-mentioned trend
concerning adversaries leveraging legitimate penetration testing
frameworks for use in malicious campaigns.
Dragos considers XENOTIME to be the most dangerous and
capable activity group. It is responsible for the disruptive and
nearly life-threatening TRISIS malware attack on an oil and gas
facility in the Middle East in 2017.

XENOTIME uses Engineering Workstation Compromise (T818) for
Initial Access
DEFINITION

Adversaries may compromise and gain control of an engineering workstation as an Initial Access technique into the control system environment.
Access to an engineering workstation may occur as result of remote access
or by physical means, such as a person with privileged access or infection by
removable media. A dual-homed engineering workstation may allow the adversary access into multiple networks. For example, unsegregated process
control, safety system, or information system networks. An Engineering
Workstation is designed as a reliable computing platform that configures,
maintains, and diagnoses control system equipment and applications. Compromise of an engineering workstation may provide access to and control of
other control system applications and equipment.

IN CONTEXT

In the TRISIS event, XENOTIME compromised a workstation capable of communicating with a safety instrumented system (SIS) to act as a staging point
for its disruptive malware.

new DYMALLOY-related activity indicating
a return to operations outside of Ukraine –
including North America and APAC.

32

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

DYMALLOY targeting generally focuses on energy companies
and advanced industry entities in Europe, Turkey, and North
America. Its attention largely shifted to Ukraine this year,
coinciding with Ukrainian parliamentary elections in July
2019. Previously, DYMALLOY has demonstrated ability to
achieve long-term and persistent access to IT and operational
environments for intelligence collection and possible future
disruption events.
DYMALLOY has used malware backdoors including Goodor,
DorShel, and Karagany. These are commodity malware
families, not unique to any particular group, but used together
as a toolkit makes this group’s behavior unique. Overall,
DYMALLOY avoids using custom toolkits in its operations,
making detection and specific attribution more difficult
without recognizing the entirety of adversary actions. Dragos
has also found the group leveraged Mimikatz, an opensource software security tool for extracting passwords from
memory on Windows systems.

DYMALLOY uses Screen Capture (T852) for Collection
DEFINITION

Adversaries may attempt to perform screen capture of devices in the control
system environment. Screenshots may be taken of workstations, HMIs, or
other devices that display environment-relevant process, device, reporting,
alarm, or related data. These device displays may reveal information regarding the ICS process, layout, control, and related schematics. In particular, an
HMI can provide a lot of important industrial process information. Analysis
of screen captures may provide the adversary with an understanding of intended operations and interactions between critical devices.

IN CONTEXT

DYMALLOY successfully obtained HMI screenshots while conducting reconnaissance in target operations networks.

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

ALLANITE activity historically focuses on ICS reconnaissance
and information gathering against US and UK victims. ALLANITE
avoids using malware for initial infection and subsequent
activity, relying instead on credential capture from authentication
attempts and use of native Windows system tools for system
discovery and information gathering.
ALLANITE relies upon insecure environments lacking adequate
network traffic control and using single-factor authentication
mechanisms for operational techniques. There is no evidence
that ALLANITE possesses or aims to use any disruptive or
destructive capability within target ICS environments. Although
superficially similar to other ICS activity groups such as Dragonfly
and DYMALLOY, ALLANITE’s methods, tools, and technology are
significantly different from these other entities.

ALLANITE uses Point and Tag Identification (T852) for Collection
DEFINITION

Adversaries may collect point and tag values to gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the process environment. Points may be values such as
inputs, memory locations, outputs or other process specific variables. Tags
are the identifiers given to points for operator convenience. Collecting such
tags provides valuable context to environmental points and enables an adversary to map inputs, outputs, and other values to their control processes.
Understanding the points being collected may inform an adversary on which
processes and values to keep track of over the course of an operation.

IN CONTEXT

ALLANITE obtained access to ICS environments, identified point and tag
values like device type and control functions. Such information could be
combined with exfiltration of plant schematics to develop and conduct tailored operations.

Dragos identified phishing activity
associated with this group in early 2019
using IT-themed lures and PowerShell
for post-exploitation. Dragos identified
additional samples of this group’s malware
indicating they are active and evolving in
more than one area.

36

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

While observed activity has not revealed an ICS-specific capability,
the CHRYSENE’s ability and intentions strongly indicate the group
is collecting information and achieving initial access in target
networks that would be necessary precursors to an attack on
ICS operations. CHRYSENE has not been observed in further
exploitation; they appear to operate as a specialized team in
victim acquisition passing the victim to another group for further
operations.
This group has some similarities to HEXANE. CHRYSENE-related
activity is known by other names within the security community
including Greenbug, APT34, and OilRig.48 In April 2019, an
unknown entity leaked a slew of hacking tools used by CHRYSENE,
compromising their known operations and behaviors.49 Dragos
assesses CHRYSENE likely shifted its behavior and retooled
following this leak.

CHRYSENE uses Scripting (T853) for Execution
DEFINITION

Adversaries may use scripting languages to execute arbitrary code in the
form of a pre-written script or in the form of user-supplied code to an interpreter. Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from
compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead
of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code
just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and
every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers
to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they
can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many
different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a
useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters
may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment.
Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to
be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly
scripting to perform a task.

IN CONTEXT

When CHRYSENE gains code execution on a target host, it may deploy encoded malware; the executable is decoded and launched via PowerShell
command. PowerShell commands can be deployed by adversaries on Windows hosts within the ICS environment.

38

THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS

In 2019, Dragos identified two new customized
applications linked to RASPITE. While the
two items were not identified until recently,
analysis indicates both were developed and
likely deployed in 2017, coinciding with the first
known activity from RASPITE. Further analysis
indicates that both applications are tools that
RASPITE, or another entity, would leverage as
part of an intrusion for network enumeration or
propagation.
RASPITE leverages custom software and
scripts to manipulate victim machines, install
malicious services, and enable remote access
to victim networks. After almost exclusively
focusing on political and strategic targets in the
Middle East in 2017, RASPITE pivoted to ICSrelated organizations in North America in 2018.

RASPITE uses Drive-by Compromise (T817) for Initial Access
DEFINITION

Adversaries may gain access to a system during a drive-by compromise,
when a user visits a website as part of a regular browsing session. With
this technique, the user’s web browser is targeted and exploited simply by
visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific
community, such as trusted third-party suppliers or other industry specific
groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack
relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise
or watering hole attack.

IN CONTEXT

Dragos observed RASPITE using watering holes for credential capture.
Though the compromised websites were not ICS-specific, employees of the
targeted ICS entities would be likely to visit them.

DEFINITION

Adversaries may perform data destruction over the course of an operation.
The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files
on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of
malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed
over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard
part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

IN CONTEXT

ELECTRUM deployed a wiper module in the 2016 CRASHOVERRIDE event.
The module was designed to impede the target’s recovery process and delete configuration files which would inhibit restoration on infected SCADA

DEFINITION

Adversaries may use spearphising attachment, a variant of spearphishing, as
a form of social engineering attack against specific targets. Spearphishing
attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs
the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are
electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual,
company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and
access.

IN CONTEXT

Dragos observed COVELLITE targeting grid operators with phishing attacks
attempting to gain initial access to their networks. Such access could establish a foothold for future compromise and potentially help facilitate
movement to the OT network.

43

CON C LUS IO N
Dragos anticipates activity targeting and affecting ICS to
increase into 2020 and further. We expect to see more
adversaries expand their focus to additional critical
infrastructure and industrial environments, which will
likely align with activity associated with military or
geopolitical conflict. Although defenders continue to gain
insight through OT-specific detection and monitoring
platforms, it is imperative we continue to improve
visibility into activities and threats impacting critical
infrastructure.
Although 2019 did not produce a disruptive or destructive
attack with an impact like CRASHOVERRIDE or TRISIS,
Dragos expects adversaries to be developing such
capabilities and will likely leverage them for disruptive
effects in the future.
Despite adversaries continuing to evolve and develop their
capabilities, Dragos anticipates continued collaboration
with our partners, clients, and the community at large
to improve cybersecurity awareness and better secure
industrial control systems.

In 2020, we plan to continue embodying
our mission to safeguard civilization.
