Justice Department Seizes $6.1 million Related to Alleged
Ransomware Extortionists
The Justice Department announced today recent actions taken against two foreign nationals
charged with deploying Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to attack businesses and government
entities in the United States.
An indictment unsealed today charges Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, a Ukrainian national, with
conducting ransomware attacks against multiple victims, including the July 2021 attack
against Kaseya, a multi-national information technology software company.
The department also announced today the seizure of $6.1 million in funds traceable to
alleged ransom payments received by Yevgeniy Polyanin, 28, a Russian national, who is
also charged with conducting Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware attacks against multiple victims,
including businesses and government entities in Texas on or about Aug. 16, 2019.

According to the indictments, Vasinskyi and Polyanin accessed the internal computer
networks of several victim companies and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to encrypt
the data on the computers of victim companies.
“Cybercrime is a serious threat to our country: to our personal safety, to the health of our
economy, and to our national security,” said Attorney General Garland. “Our message today
is clear. The United States, together with our allies, will do everything in our power to identify
the perpetrators of ransomware attacks, to bring them to justice, and to recover the funds
they have stolen from their victims.”
“Our message to ransomware criminals is clear: If you target victims here, we will target
you,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. “The Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware group
attacks companies and critical infrastructures around the world, and today’s announcements
showed how we will fight back. In another success for the department’s recently launched
Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, criminals now know we will take away your
profits, your ability to travel, and – ultimately – your freedom. Together with our partners at
home and abroad, the Department will continue to dismantle ransomware groups and disrupt
the cybercriminal ecosystem that allows ransomware to exist and to threaten all of us.”
“The arrest of Yaroslav Vasinskyi, the charges against Yevgeniy Polyanin and seizure of $6.1
million of his assets, and the arrests of two other Sodinokibi/REvil actors in Romania are the
culmination of close collaboration with our international, U.S. government and especially our
private sector partners,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The FBI has worked creatively
and relentlessly to counter the criminal hackers behind Sodinokibi/REvil. Ransomware
groups like them pose a serious, unacceptable threat to our safety and our economic wellbeing. We will continue to broadly target their actors and facilitators, their infrastructure, and
their money, wherever in the world those might be.”
“Ransomware can cripple a business in a matter of minutes. These two defendants deployed
some of the internet’s most virulent code, authored by REvil, to hijack victim computers,” said
Acting U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas. “In a matter of
months, the Justice Department identified the perpetrators, effected an arrest, and seized a
significant sum of money. The Department will delve into the darkest corners of the internet
and the furthest reaches of the globe to track down cyber criminals.”
According to court documents, Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2
ransomware attack against Kaseya. In the alleged attack against Kaseya, Vasinskyi caused
the deployment of malicious Sodinokibi/REvil code throughout a Kaseya product that caused
the Kaseya production functionality to deploy REvil ransomware to “endpoints” on Kaseya
customer networks. After the remote access to Kaseya endpoints was established, the
ransomware was executed on those computers, which resulted in the encryption of data on
computers of organizations around the world that used Kaseya software.

Through the deployment of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware, the defendants allegedly left
electronic notes in the form of a text file on the victims’ computers. The notes included a web
address leading to an open-source privacy network known as Tor, as well as the link to a
publicly accessible website address the victims could visit to recover their files. Upon visiting
either website, victims were given a ransom demand and provided a virtual currency address
to use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid the ransom amount, the defendants provided the
decryption key, and the victims then were able to access their files. If a victim did not pay the
ransom, the defendants typically posted the victims’ stolen data or claimed they sold the
stolen data to third parties, and victims were unable to access their files.
Vasinskyi and Polyanin are charged in separate indictments with conspiracy to commit fraud
and related activity in connection with computers, substantive counts of damage to protected
computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted of all counts, each
faces a maximum penalty of 115 and 145 years in prison, respectively.
The $6.1 million seized from Polyanin is alleged to be traceable to ransomware attacks and
money laundering committed by Polyanin through his use of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware.
The seizure warrant was issued out of the Northern District of Texas. Polyanin is believed to
be abroad.
On Oct. 8, Vasinskyi was taken into custody in Poland where he remains held by authorities
pending proceedings in connection with his requested extradition to the United States,
pursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Poland. In
parallel with the arrest, interviews and searches were carried out in multiple countries, and
would not have been possible without the rapid response of the National Police of Ukraine
and the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine.
The FBI’s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices are leading the investigation. Substantial
assistance was provided by the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the
National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern
District of Texas and Senior Counsel Byron M. Jones from the Justice Department’s
Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the FBI’s Dallas and Jackson
Field Offices, and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
conducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust, who were an
integral part of coordination. Investigators and prosecutors from several jurisdictions,
including: Romania's National Police and the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime
and Terrorism; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; France’s Court of Paris and BL2C
(anti-cybercrime unit police); Dutch National Police; Poland’s National Prosecutor’s Office,
Border Guard, Internal Security Agency, and Ministry of Justice; and the governments of
Norway and Australia provided valuable assistance.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),
Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), Germany’s Public Prosecutor’s Office Stuttgart and State Office of Criminal
Investigation of Baden-Wuerttemberg; Switzerland’s Public Prosecutor’s Office II of the
Canton of Zürich and Cantonal Police Zürich; United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency; U.S.
Secret Service; Texas Department of Information Resources; BitDefender; McAfee; and
Microsoft also provided significant assistance.
This case is part of the Department of Justice’s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task
Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion
attacks. As part of the task force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys’
Offices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital
extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware,
identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their
crimes. The department, through the task force, also strategically targets the ransomware
criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government
agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.
For more information about the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task
Force, read the Deputy Attorney General’s recent guidance memo on related investigations
and cases. For more resources on ransomware prevention and response,

An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
