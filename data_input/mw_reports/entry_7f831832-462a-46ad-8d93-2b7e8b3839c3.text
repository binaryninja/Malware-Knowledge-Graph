Summary
AT&T Alien Labs™ has recently observed the presence of a new remote access trojan (RAT)
malware in its threat analysis systems. The malware, known as FatalRAT (Firstly named by
@c3rb3ru5d3d53c), appears to be distributed via forums and Telegram channels, hidden in
download links that attempt to lure the user via software or media articles.

Key takeaways:
AT&T Alien Labs performed a malware analysis of the FatalRAT threat.
We have observed a new spreading mechanism via Telegram channels.
Analyzed samples are capable of performing defense evasion techniques, obtaining
system persistence, logging user keystrokes, collecting system information, exfiltrating
over encrypted command and control (C&C) channel.

Analysis
1/15

FatalRAT is a remote access trojan with a wide set of capabilities that can be executed
remotely by an attacker. The malware runs several tests before fully infecting a system,
checking the existence of multiple virtual machine products, disk space, number of physical
processors, and more (T1497.001).

Figure 1. AntiVM techniques from a system report.
One of the tests run by FatalRAT involves checking for existence of virtual machine services,
as shown in figure 2.

Figure 2. AntiVM techniques includes searching for services.
Another includes querying the registry, as shown in figure 3.

Figure 3. AntiVM techniques - registry check.
If the machine passes the malware AntiVM tests, FatalRAT will then starts its malicious
activity.
First, it decrypts each of the configuration strings separately (T1027). These configuration
strings include the Command and Control (C&C) address, new malware file name, service
name, and other settings.

Figure 4. Decrypting configuration strings.
Figure 5 shows the routine used by FatalRAT for decrypting strings.

The malware will disable the ability to lock the computer by using CTRL+ALT+DELETE. For
this purpose, the registry key DisableLockWorkstation is set to “1” as shown in figure 6
(T1112).

Figure 6. Disable computer lockdown.
After the computer lockdown is disabled, the malware activates a keylogger (T1056.001).
See figure 7.

FatalRat can persist either by modifying the registry (T1547.001) or by creating a new
service (T1569.002). If persistence is done by modifying the registry, it will create the value
'Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SVP7' to execute the malware at boot
time. When using setting service for persistence, FatalRat will retrieve the description from
its configuration as seen above in figure 4.

Figure 8. FatalRat registry persistence.
The malware collects information from an infected machine and sends it to the C&C (T1020),
as shown in figure 9. This includes external IP address, username, and other information
about the victim.
Additionally, as a defense evasion technique, FatalRAT identifies all security products
running on the machine by iterating through all running processes and searching for the
existence of a predefined list of security products (T1562.001), as shown in figure 10.

Figure 9. Collecting information.

Figure 10. Security product process search.
Furthermore, to make it easier for the attacker to detect which security products are installed,
it will convert the process name above to a product name before sending the list to the C&C.
See figure 11.

Figure 11. Security product process to name.

6/15

To communicate back to the C&C, the malware uses an arithmetic routine to encrypt the data
sent between the victim and the attacker. This encryption includes a one-byte XOR key and
the addition of a constant to the obtained value (121 in this case) (T1573.001). See figure 12.

Figure 12. C&C communication decrypting routine.
The encrypted message is then sent to the C&C as seen in the config from figure 4 through
port 8081.

Figure 13. Encrypted communication between infected host and C&C.
The malware then waits for the attacker’s commands, of which it supports a wide range. For
example, it has several routines to handle different browsers. Some of these routines include
deleting user info for specific browsers (Edge, 360Secure Browser, QQBrowser,
SogouBrowser, and Firefox). For Chrome, it will query for user info and then delete the
content. Deleting saved information will force the user to input, for example, user and
password which the malware can capture with its keylogger. (T1119)

Figure 14. Parsing C&C command.
Some of the commands FatalRat supports are shown below.
Spreading itself on the victim network by brute-forcing weak passwords through IPC$. If
successful, the malware copies itself to the dedicated folder as %Folder%\hackshen.exe and
will execute the copied file remotely. See figures 15-17.

Either steal stored data (for chrome for example) or delete saved information with a handler
for different browsers. See figure 18.

FatalRat also includes additional commands, for the following:

Recommended actions
1. Do not click links or install software from unknown sources.
2. Install an antivirus and keep your system updated.
3. Always use an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution or enable system log
monitoring to allow SIEM correlation.
4. Monitor network traffic to command and control (C&C) patterns.

Conclusion
The newly identified FatalRat malware has been using techniques like obfuscation, antisandbox and antivirus evasion, encrypted configurations, logging user keystrokes, system
persistence, login brute force, collection of system data, and encrypted communications with
command and control server. Alien Labs has discovered multiple samples in the past few
months, with a slight dip in July. However, we expect to continue to see the presence of
FatalRat and its variants in our samples in the near future. AT&T Alien Labs will continue to
monitor this threat and update intelligence as activity emerges.
