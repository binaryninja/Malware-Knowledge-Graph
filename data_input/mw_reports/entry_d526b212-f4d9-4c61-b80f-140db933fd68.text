Who was behind the 2009 hack and leak of emails from the University of East Anglia material that fuelled climate change sceptics? Gordon Corera investigates this cyber cold
case
In 2009, someone broke into the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and
stole emails. The material was distributed online - mainly on blogs linked to climate change
sceptics. It was used to make the case that scientists were surreptitiously twisting the facts to
exaggerate climate change. That was not the case. But before that became clear, events
would take on a life of their own, sparking a global media storm.
This is a story that matters - firstly because it may have set back by years efforts to combat
climate change. But also because it foretold a future in which emails would be stolen and
weaponised and where information and social media would be used to cast doubt on science
and expertise.
More than a decade on, as the UK hosts a new global climate summit - COP26 in Glasgow the mystery of who was behind ‘Climategate’ remains.
