Just a few days after Microsoft and a coalition of security firms took action against the
infrastructure used by the Trickbot malware operators, taking control of command-andcontrol servers and locking down the malicious content on them, the botnet has bounced

back and is humming right along with new C2 servers in several European and South
American countries.
On Monday, Microsoft announced a coordinated takedown operation aimed at disrupting the
Trickbot botnet, a global malware distribution and operation network that has been operating
since at least 2016. The takedown involved Microsoft obtaining court orders to seize control
of some Trickbot C2 servers based in the United States and also filing a copyright
infringement claim against the operators for misusing Microsoft’s software. The operation
follows a familiar road map that security companies and law enforcement agencies have
used to target botnets for more than a decade, targeting the C2 infrastructure to cut off
communications between infected machines and the Trickbot operators.
This method has worked well in some cases, but cybercrime groups have paid attention and
taken steps to ensure that their infrastructure is resilient and can survive a takedown attempt.
In the case of Trickbot, the operators have already set up a new fleet of C2 servers outside
the U.S., many of them in Germany, and others in the Netherlands, Colombia, Russia, and
Indonesia. These are the first layer of command servers that infected machines reach out to,
with other layers of control behind them. Unlike other botnets that use virtual private servers
on bulletproof hosting services for C2, the current crop of Trickbot control servers are housed
on compromised MikroTik consumer routers.
“It was a very well set up network and geographically distributed to make it hard to take
down. Microsoft’s action only affected the servers in the U.S., and it didn’t surprise me at all
to see new control servers pop up this quickly,” said Mark Arena, CEO of Intel 471, a security
firm that tracks Trickbot activity closely.
“They’ve learned from previous takedowns because Microsoft and others have used these
tactics before.”
The Trickbot malware is often associated with the Emotet loader and recently, the Ryuk
ransomware. The operators of Trickbot sell access to infected machines to other cybercrime
groups, especially high-level groups that have established reputations in the cybercrime
underground. Those sales are not just limited to underground groups, however. This past
summer, Intel 471 published research demonstrating a link between Trickbot and an attack
group known as Lazarus that is tied to the North Korean government. In the linked
operations, it appears that the Trickbot group sold access to compromised machines and
networks to DPRK actors, who then used that access for their own purposes.
“TrickBot certainly appears to be a source of compromised accesses that DPRK threat actors
can leverage. The operators or users of TrickBot seem to be well-versed in identifying
interesting organizations they’ve compromised for follow-up intrusion activity, be it through
Anchor or common intrusion tools (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, BloodHound, Empire, etc.), or
to pass off or sell to other threat actors, i.e., DPRK threat actors,” the research report says.

Within a few days of the Microsoft takedown operation this week, researchers observed the
Emotet botnet, which sends malicious spam, delivering new spam templates to infected
machines. Those templates included malicious documents that eventually loaded the Emotet
trojan, which then contacted a C2 server to download and run Trickbot. Business as usual.
But that doesn’t mean the actions by Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command, which
reportedly has been running its own effort to disrupt Trickbot, were futile.
“From a company perspective, it’s hard for this to be effective unless you’re willing to go on
the offensive like Cyber Command,” Arena said. “But it’s good for the U.S. to be seen as a
hard target for these groups.”
