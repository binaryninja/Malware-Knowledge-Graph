While analyzing a massive phishing campaign aimed at stealing payment data of Dutch
residents, the researchers from the Group-IBComputer Emergency Response Team (CERTGIB) discovered an approach previously unseen in the Netherlands that allows
cybercriminals to limit access to phishing websites to only potential victims. By doing this,
they ultimately increase the success rate of their fraudulent operations. According to CERTGIB data, an average phishing page's lifespan is about 24 hours; the phishing pages that
used the new approach lived six days on average.
Group-IB analysts identified multiple phishing websites impersonating Dutch financial
organizations that are part of a single network of more than 750 connected domains. The
phishing infrastructure was first seen in March 2021 and remains active until today. The
campaign was codenamed RUNLIR by Group-IB researchers, as it uses RU, NL and IR in
the domain naming pattern. As part of the analysis, Group-IB researchers also observed a
very unconventional "Cut the card" phishing scheme that requires fraudsters' efforts both
online and offline.
RUNLIR uses the combination unique for the Netherlands that involves the BlackTDS antibot service, the notorious bulletproof hosting services of Yalishanda and different versions of
the uAdmin phishing kit. This approach ensures that their phishing pages are only shown to
victims and not to security professionals.
The cybercriminals use this approach as it allows them to distinguish between unsuspecting
victims and security researchers by checking if the page viewer is connecting using a Dutch
mobile network to narrow down their reach. Nevertheless, Group-IB researchers quickly
established the necessary access conditions and upgraded their Threat Intelligence &
Attribution system with a specific proxy server to bypass these restrictions. The approach,
discovered by Group-IB CERT analysts, is new and has not been seen in phishing attacks in
the Netherlands in the past.
This blog post offers a comprehensive analysis of the unusual phishing campaign in which
the unconventional approach was first seen and a detailed description of it.
"Cut the card" phishing scheme
Among Group-IB's customers are leading Dutch financial organizations. As part of the
regular monitoring and blocking efforts, CERT-GIB analysts discovered a phishing campaign
impersonating Dutch financial organizations, including its customers. The campaign, which
targeted Dutch residents, began as early as March 2021. CERT-GIB was able to take down
those websites related to its customers immediately upon detection.

However, further analysis revealed that these phishing resources were part of a network of
more than 750 connected domains used by the criminals to host phishing pages
impersonating banks, transportation, logistics, government, telecom, housing, marketplace,
and utility companies to target users in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and other
countries. It must be considered that each of the domains has an average of three
subdomains, every one of which is able to host different phishing pages. The campaign was
codenamed RUNLIR by the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team, due to the phishing domains
naming pattern.
The phishing infrastructure shown on the Group-IB Network Graph below has been on our
radar since March 2021. CERT-GIB eliminated the websites related to its customers and is
continuing to monitor the infrastructure as phishing domains tend to reappear after some
time.

The phishing infrastructure relies on the infamous Yalishanda bulletproof hosting provider
and uses the FastFlux technique. This infrastructure is used to make the phishing sites more
resilient to take downs by global CERT teams. The sites use the BlackTDS anti-bot service
and only accept mobile devices as visitors. The cybercriminals' approach by using the
Yalishanda bulletproof hosting in combination with the BlackTDS services allows them to
mitigate unwanted eyes on the RUNLIR phishing campaign. BlackTDS is a cybercrime-as-aservice provider that provides the following services: anti-detection, traffic distribution
towards exploit kits, availability of domains that can be used for malicious campaigns like
phishing. The usage of Yalishanda, BlackTDS and customized forks of uAdmin increases the
likelihood of successful campaigns. The detailed analysis of the combination of tools can be
found in the next section of the post.
The investigation into the phishing infrastructure itself revealed that various local brands
were being impersonated, but there was one specific scheme that caught the attention of our
analysts. The unorthodox scheme instructs the victims to cut up their banking cards. It is for
that reason that we will take a dive into this phishing attack impersonating one of the Dutch
banks.
The specialized 'Cut up your banking card' scheme observed by Group-IB researchers,
typically has 5 steps. The victim count is unknown, however, according to Dutch media
reports local residents fell prey to a variation of the scheme in June 2021. Below you can find
a step-by step guide into the phishing scheme.

The initial vector, just like with many phishing campaigns, is smishing. The victim receives a
rogue SMS impersonating a local organization, which warns the users that their banking card
expires soon, and that they need to follow the link in order to prevent blockage. The smishing
message also informs the victim that the request to get a new card will be free.

5/15

Next, after clicking on the link, the unsuspecting victim is requested to provide their banking
information, including the e.dentifier response token. The e.dentifier is the physical token tool
used by the customers of Dutch banks to generate a secure token, which must be used
during the login process. Once the cybercriminals have logged in with the stolen token, they
will be in full control of the customer's banking account. In the online banking account, they
can see the amount of money the victim has, and they are able to find additional information,
such as addresses.
The websites from the screenshots provided below were blocked by the CERT-GIB
team immediately upon detection.

6/15

After the response token is sent to cybercriminals, the phishing website prompts the victim to
share all the personal data, including their name, full address, postal code, DOB, phone
number, and email address. Phishers often request more information than the minimum that
is required. Thus, the crooks have higher chances to capitalize on it by selling the data on
the dark web, for example. This information also allows the criminals to perform a quick scan
on the web to obtain a photo of their victim, which, if needed, can be used in their attack.

7/15

The criminals then ask the victim to share the PIN number of their existing bank card to use it
to steal money later. Additionally, they request that the victim provide a "new PIN code",
which leads the victim to believe that they are dealing with the legitimate website of their
bank and their existing card is not usable anymore.

In the following step, the victim is instructed to cut the card in two; the cut has to be made
through the center of the card. In fact, this step actually does not disable the functionality of
the payment card as the chip itself remains untouched. The victim is then requested to
provide a 'time' at which a 'banking employee' can come to pick up the card that has been
'cut in two'.

8/15

In the next step, the victim needs to select a window of time for the appointment with the
"bank employee" to take place. This "employee" will come to pick up the card that has been
cut in half. This card, of course, remains functional.

9/15

The last step is the official page and website of the bank that the crooks impersonated. In
this stage, the phishers have collected all the information that they need.

At the end of this scheme, the cybercriminals have all of the information needed to login and
abuse the victim's bank account. The card of the victim can be fixed by simply using some
tape, and, as the crooks have access to their bank account, they can come and pick the old
card from the victim's physical mailbox.

10/15

They are also able to request a new bank card. Just like with a card cut in half, the crooks
can get the bank card to the victim's address and pick it up once it has arrived. They will wait
for the delivery, and once the card has been delivered, the criminals will force themselves
into obtaining the newly sent card.
Information theft
When analysing the phishing websites targeted at Dutch residents involved in the RUNLIR
campaign, Group-IB researchers discovered that the campaign attempts to steal the user
information via verwerk1.php. In this specific PHP file, code is provided that requests the
information from the victim via text boxes. Once the values have been provided into the
textbox, they will be transferred to the code that is responsible for storing the information.

The code itself appears to be a genuine financial environment. It is also worth mentioning
that the campaign continues to utilize sources taken from the official target environment. The
cybercriminal(s) behind this campaign use this technique as it allows them to quickly set up
the phishing resource. Each customization can, of course, be a trigger for the victim to
identify that they are dealing with a phishing/malicious site.

The RUNLIR campaign itself uses a domain generation pattern, which has a preference for
utilizing a specific prefix, numeric values, and various top-level domains such as '.IR', and
'.RU'.
Cybercrime takes advantage of legitimate security tools
When trying to access resources involved in the RUNLIR campaign from their regular
workstation, CERT-GIB analysts would always receive the answer seen below in the image.

Deeper analysis revealed that the phishers were using the BlackTDS GEO tracking service
when a visitor tried to access the page.

Cybersecurity professionals use GEO tracking to verify that their users/visitors are from the
expected region. For example, a work environment that should only be accessible from the
Netherlands does not need to allow connections from Germany. This same concept is now
used by BlackTDS to allow cybercriminals to narrow down their reach. There is also a further
reason why the criminals might use this technique; it gives them control of the victims they
hunt down. We have seen this happen before with Russian malware, which would not run on
systems using the Russian language.
Every system with a connection to the web has to make use of an internet routing path, and
these internet routing paths are controlled by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). This means
that your mobile device will use a different route to a page when compared to a system in the
office.
The route can be explained as the system utilizing a different network. Your phone might use
the mobile network provided by your mobile internet provider, and your local system might
use your home or office network.
The RUNLIR campaign utilizes the following services to block unwanted visitors from their
phishing websites and increase the likelihood of successful phishing attempts:
BlackTDS
● They require the browser's user-agent to be a mobile user-agent
● They require the visiting IP address to connect from a mobile network
● They can detect the referrer URL and take action based on that.
● They make use of available domain patterns
Yalishanda
● Infamous bulletproof hosting service that hinders takedown efforts significantly
Phishing Kits
● Various versions of the U-Admin phishing panel, that allow cybercriminals to interact with
the actual phishing site in real time and are used to collect and manage the stolen user data
The phishing campaign uses the combination of the above tools to exclude unwanted
visitors, namely cybersecurity researchers and CERT teams, from their websites.

12/15

Nevertheless, Group-IB researchers were able to bypass the cybercriminals' detect evasion
methods by setting up a proxy that uses mobile networks, and the websites revealed
themselves:

The fact that cybercriminals have begun adopting this method is a clear indication that the
threat actors and their phishing campaigns are continuously evolving. Hence, it's really
important to constantly study cybercriminals' TTPs.
Recommendations

14/15

Here are some steps that regular users can take to better protect themselves against these
types of threats.
1. Do not click on links that you are not 100% confident are real
2. Double check that URL of a website is the official one before you submit any
information
3. If you think you may have been a victim of a phishing attack, quickly get in contact with
your bank, the organization being impersonated by the fraudsters, and the police. They
can issue an alert, which may ultimately raise awareness and reduce the victim count.
4. Keep in mind that usually official organizations do not use common URL shorteners, so
links leading to bit.ly, s.id, tny.sh and others, should be treated with suspicion. You
should double check the final destination.
5. Always use your official banking application on your mobile device.
6. Report any identified phishing emails or SMS to CERT-GIB, fraudehelpdesk.nl, or
scamadviser.com. These reports help cybersecurity professionals to investigate and
take action against fraudulent websites, in addition to helping protect other victims.
