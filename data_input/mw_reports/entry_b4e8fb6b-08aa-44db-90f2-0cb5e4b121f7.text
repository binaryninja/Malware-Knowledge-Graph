Raccoon Stealer is one of 40-plus malware families tracked through Team Cymru’s Botnet
Analysis and Reporting Service (BARS), a service which underpins our Threat Intelligence
Feeds.

Introduction to Raccoon Stealer
Raccoon Stealer is an information stealer sold to ‘affiliates’ as a Malware-as-a-Service
(MaaS) on multiple underground forums. Affiliates are provided access to a control panel
hosted on the Tor network as an onion site, where they can generate new malware builds
and review data collected from infected hosts.
Raccoon Stealer has been marketed as a service in the underground economy since at least
April 2019.

Figure 1 – Raccoon Stealer Advertisement
Raccoon Stealer has the capability to steal the following data from infected systems:
Saved passwords
Credit card information
Cryptocurrency wallets
Browser data (cookies, saved forms, etc.)
In this blog we will examine Raccoon Stealer’s initial command and control (C2)
infrastructure and assess the scale of the threat based on recent victim data.

Raccoon Stealer C2 Infrastructure
Raccoon Stealer advertisements refer to its back-end infrastructure as ‘the heart’ of the
project. The following points are emphasised as strengths over its competitors:
Automated deployment of new ‘gates’ to minimise downtime.
Existing builds still function after new ‘gates’ are deployed.
Control panel hosted on the Tor network as an onion site.
In this context, a gate is a reverse proxy that forwards traffic from victims to upstream C2
infrastructure.
At the time of execution, Raccoon Stealer samples retrieve the URL of the active gate from a
Telegram channel that is unique to the affiliate. The URL is stored in an encrypted string
located in the public description of the Telegram channel.

Figure 2 – An Example of an Affiliate Telegram Channel
A Telegram channel is created for each Raccoon Stealer affiliate, with the currently active
gate information supplied as an encrypted string in the public channel description. When a
new gate is deployed, the public channel description for all affiliates’ Telegram channels are
automatically updated to point to the new gate.
Further insight into the Raccoon Stealer infection chain is detailed in Avast’s recent blog on
the same topic.

Tracking Gates
Since July 2021 (a period of approximately 250 days), we have observed a total of 135
distinct gates, indicating an average ‘up time’ of less than two days. However, this average is
impacted by a small number of longstanding gates – particularly around the Christmas / New
Year period in 2021/22. Over 25% of the gates were active for less than 12 hours.
One key observation we were able to make is that regardless of the number of affiliates or
Telegram channels in operation, Raccoon Stealer only ever uses a single gate IP address at
any one time, which is consistent across all affiliate operations.

Figure 3 – A Summary of Raccoon Stealer ‘Gates’
As can be seen, based on the legend in Figure 3, several hosting providers are utilised by
the Raccoon Stealer operators. Since July 2021, a total of 17 distinct providers were
observed, nearly half on just one occasion, with MIVOCLOUD (47), SERVERASTRA-AS
(26), PQ-HOSTING-AS (21) and GOOGLE (18) being the most frequently occurring
providers.
Overall, it is clear the operators of Raccoon Stealer have deployed a dynamic
approach to limit the impact of cyber defence techniques (e.g., the active blocking of
IPs) on their service. Although we would note that beyond the initial gates the
infrastructure remains broadly static.

Victimology
Previous research published by Cybereason in October 2019 assessed that Raccoon Stealer
had, at the time, already infected over 100,000 endpoints. In this victimology we seek to
provide an updated indication as to the global impact of Raccoon Stealer today.
As previously referenced, during December 2021 and January 2022, several gate IP
addresses remained static for multiple days. This afforded us the opportunity to examine a
larger victim data sample than is usually available for any one particular gate IP address.
We will focus on two such gates which were active for 21-days combined.
When examining network telemetry for these gates, a total of ~95,000 distinct IP addresses
were observed connecting over TCP/80 (the port used for initial victim connections to the
gate).

4/5

Attempts were made to filter out ‘unlikely’ victims, for example by omitting connections from
large hosting providers, or from IP addresses identified as proxies or anonymisation
services. Caveats must also be made for occurrences involving dynamically assigned IPs or
scanning activity.

Figure 4 – Potential Raccoon Stealer Victims
Figure 4 provides an illustration of WHOIS information for the ~95,000 IP addresses
beaconing to the Raccoon Stealer gates. This data indicated significant concentrations in
Brazil, India, Indonesia, and the United States, as well as clusters in Southeast Asia,
Northern Africa and Europe.
As has been covered by other commentators on this threat activity, we also note an absence
of potential victims in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries – which remains
consistent with the Raccoon Stealer advertising (‘NO CIS EVER!’).
Our assessment of the Raccoon Stealer operators is ‘likely Russian-speaking, but not
necessarily Russian-based’. A future blog will explore our understanding of the management
of Raccoon Stealer.
In conclusion, based on Team Cymru’s snapshot of global internet activity, Raccoon
Stealer continues to ‘create’ thousands of new victims per week from countries
around the world.
