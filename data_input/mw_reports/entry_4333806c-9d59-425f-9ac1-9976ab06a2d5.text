Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is often implemented as a form of enterprise identity
security to protect organizations against credential theft , dictionary attacks, and brute force
techniques. But what if MFA is intercepted by a fraudster? In the cyber arena, where there is
a continuous arms race with offensive and defensive strategies trying to outcompete each
other, techniques that overcome MFA have existed for some time. In this blog, we share the
techniques that utilize surprisingly simple tools that were used to overcome enterprise
identity access management (IAM) and conduct supply chain attacks.
Introduction
For many years, cybercriminals have used social engineering and phishing attacks to trick
unsuspected victims into providing their credentials. These credentials have been used to
provide cybercriminals with access to a wide range of company resources for a number of
well-documented purposes. To remain ahead of threat actors, and in its mission to fight all
types of cybercrime, Group-IB helps organizations protect their digital assets and identify the
miscreants targeting them by investigating phishing attacks.

On July 26, 2022, Group-IB intelligence analysts received a request from a client of our
Threat Intelligence solution asking for additional information on a recent phishing attack that
they had experienced. The investigation started after the client provided domain names and
IP addresses used in the attack.
Using a combination of Group-IB Threat Intelligence, and in-house and public tools we
were able to obtain a list of domains that had been attacked. Our client was only one of
several well-known organizations that were targeted in a massive phishing campaign
codenamed 0ktapus by Group-IB researchers. The initial objective of the attackers was
clear: obtain Okta identity credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes from users
of the targeted organizations. With this information in hand, the attackers could gain
unauthorized access to any enterprise resources the victims have access to.
This case is of interest because despite using low-skill methods it was able to compromise a
large number of well-known organizations. Furthermore, once the attackers compromised an
organization they were quickly able to pivot and launch subsequent supply chain attacks,
indicating that the attack was planned carefully in advance.
Group-IB decided to make its research on 0ktapus publicly available when Signal reported
1,900 of their user’s accounts were probably hacked. We hope this blog will provide a better
understanding of what happened and will give useful recommendations on how to prevent
your organization from becoming a victim.

Attack scheme overview
Based on the request from our client, and from public reports made by Twilio and Cloudflare,
the attacks were well designed and executed. The attackers targeted employees of
companies that are customers of IAM leader Okta. These employees received text
messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of
their organization. Examples of observed phishing SMS messages can be found in the two
public reports mentioned above.

Deep dive into the attack
Phishing sites
In total, the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team detected 169 unique domains involved in the
0ktapus campaign. When analyzing these phishing sites, Group-IB analysts pay attention to
all resources being used. On many occasions, there are images, fonts or scripts that are
unique enough that they can be used to find other sites using the same phishing kit. In this
case, we found an image that is legitimately used by sites leveraging Okta authentication,
being used by the phishing kit.
If we correlate the hash value of this image with the keyword “_nuxt” (which is a folder name
utilized by the frontend of the phishing kit), we can obtain a unique list of related domains.
These domains were all used by the attackers to target organizations in multiple industries,
located mostly in the United States and Canada. Based on the fact that many of these
organizations use Okta’s Identity and Access Management services to secure access to
enterprise resources, we named this campaign 0ktapus.
At this time, it became very clear that the threat actors’ immediate intentions were to gain
access to the corporate services of the organizations.

in the phishing campaigns

Figure 2: Sample of phishing sites found that emulate Okta authentication pages
Interestingly, the domains being registered for the attacks used keywords like sso, vpn, okta,
mfa, and help. Although, those are commonly used keywords, on occasions other keywords
are used, or no keywords at all. As part of best practices, we also started tracking those
keywords. However, often we only need to discover one domain to find the others.
From the victim’s point of view, the phishing site looks quite convincing as it is very similar to
the authentication page they are used to seeing. Victims are prompted for their username
and password, and once provided a second page is shown asking for their 2FA code. Once
the code has been handed to the phishers, the browser is forced to download a legitimate
copy of the remote administration tool AnyDesk. It is still unknown the true purpose of
pushing AnyDesk.exe to the victim’s asset, especially when the phishing link was sent via
SMS to a mobile phone. Thus we decided the attacker didn’t configure the phishing kit
properly in order to target mobile devices. That may indicate that the attacker is
inexperienced.

organization
The frontend of the phishing sites uses the Nuxt.js framework while the backend uses
Django, running on port 8080.

emulated Okta authentication pages
The phishing site is static, meaning attackers cannot interact with victims in real-time like
more sophisticated phishing kits do. However, to gain access before the 2FA codes expire,
the attackers need to use the compromised data as soon as they get it. Most likely, this
means that attackers were continuously monitoring their tools and using the credentials as
soon as they received them.

With an efficient way to find new phishing sites, the next step was to locate a copy of the
phishing kit being used. For this, we used Virustotal. It is well known that even cyber
criminals use the popular antivirus scan service. A search for the hash of the image we were
using to track phishing domains resulted in many false positives and one true positive. It
appears that the miscreants had shared the kit among themselves using the file hosting
service Pomf.cat and one of them scanned the link with Virustotal to make sure there was no
malware in it.
With a copy of the phishing kit in our possession, we were ready to start digging and get a
better understanding of the threat our client was facing.

Nowadays, many phishing actors prefer to use kits that deliver the compromised data
obtained from victims to a Telegram channel controlled by them. Therefore, we were not too
surprised to see that this kit was not any different. Hiding at the end of the file containing the
settings for Django, were a few lines dedicated to the configuration of the Telegram bot and
the channel used by the kit to drop compromised data.

Analysis of compromised data
Group-IB utilized patented technologies implemented in Threat Intelligence service to
uncover the information obtained from all 0ktapus campaigns launched since March 2022.
The analysis of compromised credentials sheds light on targets and helps us understand the
attacks’ potential impact.

8/16

The analysis shows that most targeted companies are located in the USA. That list also
includes companies that are headquartered in other countries but have US-based employees
that were targeted.

9/16

Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to identify all targeted companies, because ⅔ of the data
didn’t contain a corporate email, but only usernames and 2FA codes. In those cases, we
could only identify the region of residence of the victims.

Most companies in the victims’ list are providing IT, software development, and cloud
services. As described in Twilio’s blog, the attackers try to obtain credentials in order to
access private data, corporate emails and internal documents.
Seeing financial companies in the compromised list gives us the idea that the attackers were
also trying to steal money. Furthermore, some of the targeted companies provide access to
crypto assets and markets, whereas others develop investment tools.
Based on recent news about hacked Signal accounts, we can assume the fraudsters may try
to get access to private conversations and data. That information can be used as business
intelligence and reselled to the victim's competitors or could be used to ransom a victim.
According to published blogs by Twillio and Cloudflare, victims received SMS with phishing
links. It is still unknown how fraudsters prepared their target list and how they obtained the
phone numbers. But, according to the compromised data we analyzed, the actors started
their attacks targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies. Chances are,
some phone numbers may have been obtained from those initial attacks.

Supply chain attacks
Recent disclosures reveal that the initial compromises were just part of the attack. In many
cases the attacker targeted mailing lists or customer-facing systems in order to launch
supply chain attacks:
Marketing firm Klaviyo was breached and personal information connected to
cryptocurrency-related accounts, reportedly including names, addresses, emails, and
phone numbers, was stolen. This information could be used in order to steal
cryptocurrency.
Email platform Mailchimp was breached to gain access to data from crypto-related
companies and disrupt operations. Mailchimp was used by technology firm
DigitalOcean to send confirmation emails, password resets, email-based alerts. By
initiating and redirecting password resets the customers of DigitalOcean could have
been compromised.
Phone number verification provider Twilio was breached, which allowed the attacker to
attempt to re-register Signal accounts to new mobile devices.
While it is possible that the threat actor may have been lucky in their attacks it is far more
likely that they carefully crafted their attacks in order to launch the sophisticated supply chain
attacks outlined above. It is not yet clear if the attacks were planned end-to-end in advance
or whether opportunistic actions were taken at each stage. Regardless, it is clear that the
attack has been incredibly successful and the full scale of the attack may not be known for
some time.

Subject X
Using Telegram features, it is possible to get some information about the channel used by
the phishing kit to collect compromised data, such as its name and the users administering it.

campaigns that emulated Okta authentication pages
Unfortunately, there was no useful information on the first Telegram account, but luck was on
our side with the second one. For now, we will call the creator of the “Okta” channel, Subject
X, allegedly a 22-year-old software developer.

Figure 10: Subject X’s Telegram account
Using Group-IB Threat Intelligence to monitor Telegram channels used by cybercriminals, we
were able to identify a few channels where Subject X was active at some point. One of the
posts made by Subject X in 2019 led us to his Twitter account. The same tool also gave us
the name and last name the administrator of the channel was using, before adopting the
name “X”.

Looking up the Twitter handle on Google gives back a GitHub account containing the same
username and profile picture. This account also suggests the location of Subject X is North
Carolina, United States.

From here, we went down the rabbit hole of Internet clues that led us to the alleged identity
of Subject X.
Recommendations to avoid becoming a victim
Maintaining a secure organization requires ongoing vigilance. Security measures such as
MFA can appear secure but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively
simple tools. Using Group-IB Threat Intelligence helps maintain a strong security posture by
equipping security teams and tools with the latest insight into attackers.
Group-IB recommends the following to mitigate similar attacks:
1. End users should always check, carefully, the URL of the site where you are entering
your credentials. This is especially important for users with privileged accounts.
2. Treat all URLs that were received from unknown sources as suspicious. If in doubt,
forward them to your security team for analysis.
3. Implement a FIDO2-compliant security key from a vendor like YubiKey for multi-factor
authentication, like Cloudflare suggests
4. If you think your credentials might have been compromised, immediately change your
password, sign off from all active sessions, and report the incident to your manager and
security team.
In line with Group-IB's mission of fighting cybercrime, we will continue to explore the
methods, tools, and tactics used by these phishing actors. We will also continue to inform
and warn targeted organizations worldwide. We always strive to ensure that organizations
under attack are notified as quickly as possible to help reduce potential damage. We also
consider it our responsibility to share our findings with the cybersecurity community and
encourage researchers to study advanced threats, share data, and use our technologies to
combat cybercrime — together.
If you are interested in what we do and would like to become an expert in the same field, you
can take our Digital Forensics, Incident Response, and Threat Intelligence training courses.
