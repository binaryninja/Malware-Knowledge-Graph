How we’re protecting users from government-backed attacks from
North Korea

As part of Threat Analysis Group (TAG)’s mission to counter serious threats to Google and
our users, TAG has been tracking government-backed hacking activity tied to North Korea for
over a decade. Today, as a follow up to Mandiant’s report on APT43, we are sharing TAG's
observations on this actor and what Google is doing to protect users from this group and
other government-backed attackers. Because TAG’s visibility into this actor is distinct from
Mandiant’s, TAG uses the name ARCHIPELAGO to track a subset of APT43 activity.
TAG began tracking ARCHIPELAGO in 2012 and has observed the group target individuals
with expertise in North Korea policy issues such as sanctions, human rights and nonproliferation issues. These targets include Google and non-Google accounts belonging to
government and military personnel, think tanks, policy makers, academics, and researchers
in South Korea, the US and elsewhere.
To safeguard users at-risk, TAG uses our research on serious threat actors like
ARCHIPELAGO to improve the safety and security of Google’s products. TAG adds newly
discovered malicious websites and domains to Safe Browsing to protect users from further
exploitation. We also send all targeted Gmail and Workspace users government-backed
attacker alerts notifying them of the activity. We encourage potential targets to enroll in
Google's Advanced Protection Program, enable Enhanced Safe Browsing for Chrome and
ensure that all devices are updated.

ARCHIPELAGO phishing: persistent and targeted
ARCHIPELAGO often sends phishing emails where they pose as a representative of a
media outlet or think tank and ask North Korea experts to participate in a media interview or
request for information (RFI). The emails prompt recipients to click a link to view the
interview questions or RFI. When the recipient clicks, the link redirects to a phishing site that
masquerades as a login prompt. The phishing page records keystrokes entered into the login
form and sends them to an attacker-controlled URL. After the recipient enters their
1/7

password, the phishing page redirects to a benign document with contextually appropriate
interview questions, or an RFI that would make sense to the recipient based on the content
of the original phishing email.

ARCHIPELAGO invests time and effort to build rapport with targets, often corresponding with
them by email over several days or weeks before finally sending a malicious link or file. In
one case, the group posed as a journalist for a South Korean news agency and sent benign
emails with an interview request to North Korea experts. When recipients replied expressing
interest in an interview, ARCHIPELAGO continued the correspondence over several emails
before finally sending a OneDrive link to a password-protected file that contained malware.
ARCHIPELAGO has also sent links that lead to “browser-in-the-browser” phishing pages.
The phishing pages present users with a fake browser window rendered inside the actual
browser window. The fake browser window displays a URL and a login prompt designed to
trick users into thinking they are entering their password into a legitimate login page.

Shifting phishing tactics
ARCHIPELAGO has shifted their phishing tactics over time. For several years, they sent
typical phishing messages that posed as Google Account security alerts. Over time this
technique became less successful and ARCHIPELAGO has evolved and experimented with
new phishing that might be more difficult for users and common security controls to catch.

Example from 2015 of an ARCHIPELAGO phishing email
One example of ARCHIPELAGO’s shifting phishing techniques is a campaign in late 2022
where they sent links to a benign PDF file hosted in OneDrive. The PDF claimed to be a
message from the State Department Federal Credit Union notifying customers they detected
malicious logins from their Google Account and that the customer should click the link in the
PDF to verify activity from their Gmail account. If clicked, the link directed recipients to a
phishing page. ARCHIPELAGO created unique PDFs for each recipient so that when the
recipient clicked, the phishing page was pre-populated with the recipient’s email address.

By placing the phishing link inside a benign PDF hosted on a legitimate cloud hosting
service, ARCHIPELAGO was likely trying to evade detection by AV services that do not scan
links inside files.

Malware operations

For several years, ARCHIPELAGO focused on conducting traditional credential phishing
campaigns. More recently, TAG has observed ARCHIPELAGO incorporate malware into
more of their operations, including efforts to evade detection and develop novel malware
techniques. To protect their malware from AV scanning, ARCHIPELAGO commonly
password-protects their malware and shares the password with recipients in a phishing
email.

decrypting the attachment is included in the body of the phishing email.

Encoding malware payloads and commands in Drive file names
ARCHIPELAGO has experimented with their malware over time, including using novel
malware delivery techniques. In 2020, they began testing a then-new technique with files
they hosted on Google Drive. ARCHIPELAGO encoded malicious payloads in the filenames
of files hosted on Drive, while the files themselves contained zero bytes of content. They also
used Drive file names for C2, placing encoded commands in file names. Security
researchers at Huntress and IssueMakersLab publicly reported on this technique.
Google took action to disrupt ARCHIPELAGO’s use of Drive file names to encode malware
payloads and commands. The group has since discontinued their use of this technique on
Drive.

Malware packaged in ISO files
ARCHIPELAGO has also attempted to deliver malware via Drive using ISO files, a file format
that has gained popularity among threat actors ranging from government-backed attackers to
financially motivated groups. In one case TAG recently examined, ARCHIPELAGO sent a
phishing email with a Drive link to an ISO file, Interview_with_Voice_of_America.iso. The ISO
file contained a ZIP, which, in turn, contained a password-protected document. When
decrypted, the document installed VBS-based malware related to BabyShark.

Malicious Chrome Extensions
ARCHIPELAGO has also used malicious Chrome extensions in combination with phishing
and malware. The earliest versions of these extensions, reported as STOLEN PENCIL in
2018, included functionality to steal usernames, passwords and browser cookies. They were
delivered via phishing emails with a link that directed recipients to a lure document that
prompted users to install the malicious Chrome extension. Google has since introduced
several changes to the Chrome extension ecosystem, including enhanced transparency
through the Chrome Web Store and Manifest V3, that effectively disrupt threat actors from
distributing malicious extensions like STOLEN PENCIL via the Chrome Web Store. In 2018,

Chrome also made improvements to the extension review process by making extensions that
request powerful permissions subject to additional compliance review while also conducting
ongoing monitoring of extensions that use remotely hosted code.
More recently, ARCHIPELAGO has attempted work-arounds to install a new malicious
Chrome extension known publicly as SHARPEXT. If successfully installed on a user system,
SHARPEXT can parse emails from active Gmail or AOL Mail tabs and exfiltrate them to an
attacker-controlled system. As a result of improved security in the Chrome extension
ecosystem, ARCHIPELAGO must now complete several additional steps to install the
extension, including first successfully installing malware on the user system and then
overwriting the Chrome Preferences and Secure Preferences files to allow the extension to
run.

Protecting against advanced threats
TAG, in partnership with Mandiant and other security teams across Google, is committed to
our mission of understanding and countering advanced threats. We apply our research to
ensure Google’s products are secure and our users are safe. For individuals at high risk of
this activity and other serious threats, Google provides advanced security resources,
including Enhanced Safe Browsing and the Advanced Protection Program. When these tools
are used in combination with Google’s Security Checkup, they provide the fastest and
strongest level of protection against serious threats.
