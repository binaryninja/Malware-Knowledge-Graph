As reported by Facebook and Apple, Microsoft can confirm that we also recently experienced
a similar security intrusion.
Consistent with our security response practices, we chose not to make a statement during
the initial information gathering process. During our investigation, we found a small number
of computers, including some in our Mac business unit, that were infected by malicious
software using techniques similar to those documented by other organizations. We have no
evidence of customer data being affected and our investigation is ongoing.
This type of cyberattack is no surprise to Microsoft and other companies that must grapple
with determined and persistent adversaries (see our prior analysis of emerging threat
trends). We continually re-evaluate our security posture and deploy additional people,
processes, and technologies as necessary to help prevent future unauthorized access to our
networks.
