As Diavol Ransomware Is New on the Threat Landscape Researchers Weren’t Sure Where it
Would Fit.

We recently witnessed the appearance of a new ransomware strain that was dubbed as
Diavol ransomware by the security researchers from FortiGuard Lab.
Diavol ransomware could be linked to the Wizard Spider threat actor as the researchers
discovered a few similarities in the M.O. used by the malware. Wizard Spider is a
cybercrime group from Russia that uses Trickbot, Ryuk, and Conti ransomware as their
primary tools.
It is believed that the Health Service Executive cyberattack in Ireland could’ve been
conducted by this very organization. The cybercrime group has been known to have a
tendency towards wire fraud previously when they also used Diavol and Conti threat
payloads in ransomware attacks back in early June this year.

What’s New?
As Diavol ransomware is a relatively new actor in the threat landscape, researchers weren’t
sure where it would fit, but a recent report indicates a strong connection with Wizard Spider.
Both Diavol and Conti ransomware families’ samples use the same asynchronous I/O
operations for file encryption queuing, along with virtually identical command-line
parameters.
However, despite similarities, the researchers couldn’t find a strong connection
between Diavol and Wizard Spider. Some notable differences, making the attribution
impossible have been identified.
There are no built-in checks in Diavol that stop the payloads from running on Russian
targets’ systems, as Conti does. Additionally, there is no evidence of data exfiltration
abilities before encryption.
Diavol’s encryption uses user-mode Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs), a function that
executes without synchronization in the context of a particular threat.
The technique is also known as AtomBombing, and is a code injection technique that often
goes undetected by antivirus solutions. The APC in question uses an asymmetric
encryption algorithm, thus making it stand apart from other ransomware families, and on
that very chain of thought, it also speeds up significantly the encryption process.
Symmetric algorithms are often used to significantly speed up the encryption process,
therefore are being used by the vast majority of ransomware families.
Diavol ransomware also lacks any type of obfuscation as does not use packing or antidisassembly methods, thus making the analysis harder as the malware gets stored in
bitmap images.

Another interesting aspect about Diavol ransomware is the fact that upon execution, the
ransomware manages to extract the code from the images’ PE resource section in order to
then load them within a buffer with permissions to run, with the code extracting 14 different
routines that will execute in the following order:
Create an identifier for the victim
Initialize configuration
Register with the C&C server and update the configuration
Stop services and processes
Initialize encryption key
Find all drives to encrypt
Find files to encrypt
Prevent recovery by deleting shadow copies
Encryption
Change the desktop wallpaper
Right before Diavol ransomware is done, it will change each encrypted Windows device’s
background to a black wallpaper with the following message: “All your files are encrypted!

Conti payloads named locker.exe were found in the network, thus strengthening the
possibility that the threat actor could indeed be Wizard Spider.
The journalists at CYWARE believe that the connection of this ransomware to already
established cybercrime groups shows how ransomware operations are constantly evolving,
and it will probably not be a surprise if more of such established cybercrime groups will be
joining the list of ransomware operators in the upcoming months.
