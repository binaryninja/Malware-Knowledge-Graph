Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for February: MUMMY
SPIDER
February 8, 2018
Adam Meyers Research & Threat Intel

In continuance of our monthly blog post to introduce a new threat actor, February 2018
features a criminally motivated actor we call MUMMY SPIDER. This actor is associated
with the malware commonly known as Emotet or Geodo.
MUMMY SPIDER is a criminal entity linked to the core development of the malware most
commonly known as Emotet or Geodo. First observed in mid-2014, this malware shared
code with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan. However, MUMMY SPIDER swiftly
developed the malware’s capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command
and control (C2) communication and a modular architecture.
MUMMY SPIDER does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, MUMMY
SPIDER usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a
period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version.

After a 10 month hiatus, MUMMY SPIDER returned Emotet to operation in December 2016
but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is
currently acting as a ‘loader’ delivering other malware packages. The primary modules
perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection
from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is
also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the
banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.
MUMMY SPIDER advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it
became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by
MUMMY SPIDER or with a small trusted group of customers.
