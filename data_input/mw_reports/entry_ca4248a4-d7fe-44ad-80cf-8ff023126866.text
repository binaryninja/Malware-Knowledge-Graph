Talking about the unprecedented success story of the People’s Republic of China (hereafter simply ‘China’) has
almost become a cliché. However, it is undeniable that China has developed into a key actor in world politics, and
other states cannot overlook or ignore its opinion or intentions on whichever considered terrain. With its immense
and growing influence over the whole planet, cyberspace is no exception.
According to Internet Live Stats, the number of internet users has already surpassed 3.4 billion, with 721 million
coming from China.1 Naturally, China is increasingly dependent on various cyber assets and the Chinese authorities
have reacted accordingly. We have witnessed a growing emphasis on cyber security measures, as well as an increase
in the country’s readiness to take advantage of the opportunities that the internet provides, and to respond to the
threats it poses to national security. With the largest population in the world, China holds a sizeable pool of experts
with potential value for the government and its cyber operations.
Understanding China’s cyber structure, strategies and organisation is not an easy task. The Chinese have not
established an exhaustive approach to cyber issues in the form of a strategy clearly outlining the country’s cyber
objectives and their execution. This has created much uncertainty for both China’s domestic environment and,
understandably, outsiders for whom the complex hierarchies, command structures and various defence papers are
very confusing. Even though the Chinese do not seem to mind a certain degree of mystery, a step suggesting their
increasing desire to manage their cyber operations more efficiently can be seen in the recent creation of the Central
Internet Security and Information Leading Group, for which Xi Jinping has taken personal responsibility to define
China’s cyber strategy. This also stands as a good example of how the Chinese understand cyber as something
strongly integrated with society, and do not separate it from the general flow of governance. Admittedly, the
challenges that originate from such a distinctive approach to cyber have great potential to affect the Western world’s
activities in cyberspace for a number of reasons.
First, the way in which the world’s biggest internet community is governed influences the overall development of
the internet worldwide. Granting netizens the opportunity to become a part of the online world free from physical
constraints, or restricting their access to information and using the internet as a tool against dissent are the two
fundamentally different choices facing the Chinese government. As it has so far stuck to the second option, China’s
participation in the global internet community has been greatly hindered, and thus countless opportunities for
cooperation have been missed.
Secondly, there is significant evidence that the Chinese government, together with the Chinese military, private
corporations, and unaffiliated citizens, conduct intrusions against major Western powers as well as in the
neighbouring region every day, targeting academia, industry and government facilities for the purpose of amassing
technological secrets.2 For example, the Chinese have, among other high-tech weapon system designs, obtained
those of the F-35 stealth fighter – America’s most expensive military investment ever. 3 The underlying purpose of
these activities is to gain advantage in the economic, political and military fields, and often simply show the extensive
harm they are capable of causing should the need arise.

2 Richard Clarke, a former special advisor on cyber security to President George W. Bush, illustrates the situation rather
comprehensively, believing the Chinese hacking to be unprecedented in the history of espionage: ‘Exabytes of data have been
copied from universities, industrial labs, and government facilities. The secrets behind everything from pharmaceutical formulas
to bioengineering designs, to nanotechnology, to weapons systems, to everyday industrial products have been taken by the
People’s Liberation Army and by private hacking groups and given to China.’ Clarke, Richard A., and Robert K. Knake. Cyber War:

While some experts suggest that China’s cyber units have so far ‘outmanned and outclassed’4 their adversaries, the
West has actually demonstrated firm responses. For instance, several Chinese telecommunication companies such
as Huawei have been banned from contracting and acquiring any broadband network providers in the US and
Australia.5 It seems that whichever direction the Chinese offensive cyber capabilities develop, the West is unwilling
to accept any growing danger to its private information, cyber infrastructure or security in general. 6
In order to establish a comprehensive understanding of China’s cyber attitude, it is of paramount importance to
know its strengths and weaknesses. For that purpose, this paper aims to give readers a detailed overview of China’s
cyber capabilities, related documents and strategies, and the general command structure of its tactical execution
layer. Importantly, the country’s distinct approach raises the necessity of introducing the general national strategic
thinking and framework into which cyber falls. The paper acts as a comprehensive starting point for anyone aiming
to get a foothold on affairs related to China and cyber.

As with most states, China is heavily dependent on technology, making the government highly concerned about
developments regarding the internet and the information flow that it generates. The Chinese see uncontrolled
information as a threat to the regime, paying great efforts to obtain the economic gains that the internet provides,
but simultaneously maintaining political control.7 It is believed that, for the Chinese, the whole concept of the
internet is built around controlling information through real-time censorship, constituting a completely different
view from that in the West.8 Indeed, ever since the internet became a publicly available communication platform in
China, the question was not whether to control it, but rather how to control it. 9 The most explicit example of such
regulatory measures is of course the Great Firewall of China, which by monitoring all traffic in Chinese cyberspace
enables the authorities to deny access to a variety of selected websites and disconnect all Chinese networks from
the global internet network.
Other than being afraid of the growth of internal opposition through information, the government is also very
sensitive about foreign information systems. Despite local technology and telecom companies’ efforts to supply high
quality products for domestic use, a large part of technology connected to Chinese networks still originates from the
West. Chinese officials are convinced that these systems are equipped with Trojan horses and loopholes to steal
China’s national secrets and prevent its further economic upsurge. 10 To counter these fears, the government has

imposed heavy controls over the information security industry, deterring foreign investors, especially the Americans,
from seeking business opportunities in China. Yet, demonstrating how far the Chinese still are from the desired
technological independence, Beijing was not particularly pleased when in early 2014, Microsoft decided to stop
customer support for Windows XP, the operating system used extensively in Chinese government computers.

Public discussion about the nature and future of cyberspace was brought to the international level only very
recently.11 In 2013, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts, including the representative from China,
concluded that the UN Charter and international law are fully applicable to state behaviour in cyberspace, a position
which has also been taken by NATO countries.12 However, this position impliedly assumes the use of already existing
institutional framework, which, facilitated by ICANN, is more multi-stakeholder than intergovernmental. The latter
would better allow each government to regulate the internet itself, the main premise of China’s strong belief in socalled ‘cyber sovereignty’.
China has introduced its alternative position through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the UN
General Assembly, together with Russia and several Central Asian countries, first in 2011, with a revised version in
January 2015.13 A common line between the SCO countries is a belief in the primacy of the nation state, which should
be carried over into cyberspace.14 According to a report by the US-China Security Review Commission, this allows
the Chinese to dwell on two corollaries. Firstly, the users of cyberspace, both domestic and foreign citizens within a
state’s territory, should be controlled by the host state, a clear contradiction of the Western position which supports
a liberal cyberspace respecting human rights.15 In China’s political culture, maintaining social order is unquestionably
more important than individual privacy.16 Secondly, China is particularly sensitive in exercising its right to sovereignty
in cyberspace and does not want it to be interfered with by any other state or international organisation. 17 Therefore,
somewhat contradictory to its position regarding the UN report, China does not see international law as the main
regulator of cyberspace, but prefers each state setting its own rules.18 China has also criticised the Tallinn Manual as
an effort to manipulate cyberspace through law. 19
Another concern characterising China’s attitude towards general governance of cyberspace is its antipathy to the
US. As many official statements by the Chinese press, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and academics have shown,
China is concerned about the US using its status and influence as the world’s leading technology power to establish
international rules and norms favourable to the US. Thus, China often justifies its actions in cyberspace as a response
to hostile developments by the US military.20 A point further strengthening this understanding is the fact that ICANN
11 When talking about rules in the internet, it is necessary to distinguish between two separate concepts. First, ‘internet

governance’ is a term for norms, rules and procedures that shape the use of the internet in general, and is facilitated by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Different from ‘Internet governance’ is the framework of how a
sovereign state behaves in cyberspace.

is located in Los Angeles and is under US jurisdiction, even though it is independent of the US government. Moreover,
as the US is a founding member of the majority of the world’s international institutions, China believes it to have
exceptional control over cyberspace and its governing principles. For example, during the Budapest Conference on
Cyberspace in 2012, the official statement of the Chinese representative included points that criticised the US for
militarising cyberspace and unfairly allocating cyber resources among only developed states to maintain its control.21
This is why several Chinese experts believe China has a key role in promoting a new, ‘common and inclusive global
internet governance’22 model that redistributes digital resources and governance rights more equitably. Admittedly,
such a model would probably lack legitimacy in the eyes of a large part of the international community.23

The different understandings of internet governance can be seen as part of the general existential competition
between China and the West, which often asks whether China will continue growing as the peaceful lion as it claims,
or whether conflict with the liberal democratic ideologies is bound to occur. As the US undeniably has the greatest
economic and military capabilities among the West, it has taken the lead in containing China’s growth. Whereas
physical confrontation has so far been avoided, the situation is certainly fiercer in cyberspace, which both the US
Department of Defense (DoD) and the PLA have begun to view as a new domain of conflict, seeing cyber espionage
and malicious activities from both parties, who refuse to admit their state-level involvement and rather blame their
opponent.24 China considers itself equal with the US when it comes to comparing the two countries’ size, power and
influence in the online field, which creates tensions over who should dominate the digital world.25 Understandably,
such tensions frustrate cooperative interaction not only in the cyber domain, but also in the economic and political
fields.
After the US indicted five PLA officers for stealing data from American corporations in May 2014, 26 many saw the
cyber-agreement between President Xi and President Obama in September 2015 as a positive development. Both
Presidents pledged not to knowingly conduct or support cyber theft, including that of intellectual property, trade
secrets, or confidential business information in general.27 Some cyber security firms have indeed noted a reduced
number of attacks against American businesses, but this might be due to improved tactics making the attackers
harder to detect, or simply a turn to new, uninformed targets in other countries, and not because of any deep respect
for the agreement.28 FireEye’s recent report states that the China-based units’ operations against US companies saw
a decline in frequency a year before the Xi-Obama agreement and have since become more focused and calculated

23 The subject of a broader-based internet governance model was brought up at the World Conference on International
Telecommunications in 2012. The outcome was a clear split between nations favouring the introduction of a multilateral
governance model (most of the so-called BRICS countries, with the exception of India, and developing countries) and those
opposed to it, including the USA, EU member states, Australia and Japan.

and have maintained their level of success. The report attributes such changes to military and political changes
within China, the frequent exposure of Chinese hackers, as well as the pressure and threat of sanctions from the
US.29 Nevertheless, the overall situation has remained fairly static and therefore the Xi-Obama agreement should
not be seen as a turning point.
It is essential to note that the foundation of such behaviour, as well as Chinese thinking on asymmetric warfare in
general and particularly on cyber-war, was laid down in Unrestricted Warfare – a book written by two PLA colonels
Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui in 1999 to provide a strategy of how China as a weaker country could defeat a
technologically superior foe outside the scope of using hard military power. Part of the American media irresponsibly
depicted the book a grand strategy to destroy the US due to its precise scrutiny of the American military. Indeed,
the colonels identified the US military’s main weakness as its dependence on ICT-networked systems through which
the Chinese could obtain an asymmetric advantage. 30 According to SIPRI’s database, at the time of the book’s
publication, the difference in the two countries’ military expenditure was about 15-fold. Even though the gap has
closed significantly, the US defence budget is still around three times that of China.31 Therefore, if the front door
remains closed, the smart player will try to sneak in through the back door or a window. That is exactly what the
Chinese strategy is about – knowing that even with wholesale modernisation, it will not be the equal of the US
military for decades, and so China is ready to win any confrontation without physical battles by using efficient and
overwhelming cyber-attacks.32
However, even though the book has predominantly been characterised as a plan to defeat the US, it really should
be perceived as an opportunity to understand China’s different operational thinking on the power struggle in
general. This is something that needs to be noticed and learned not only by the US, but also by other Western powers
if they want to be on par with China in the cyber race. Colonels Qiao and Wang noted that it is vital to recognise that
the battlefields in future wars will be traditionally non-war spheres like cyberspace, which strongly affect national
security.33

In looking into Chinese cyber developments, one should also be aware of their dissimilar terminology for cyber as
compared to the North-Atlantic area.34 Efforts have been made to reconcile the mismatches, but these continue to
be met by a remarkable lack of enthusiasm. What can be done for the purpose of this research is to explain the most
significant differences.
To begin with, the Chinese do not use the word cyber as extensively as the West. They perceive everything related
to cyber developments as part of a broader transformation from an industrial society to an information society,
referring to the process as informationisation or informatisation (the latter is normally used in translations and has

34 As Keir Giles and William Hagestad point out in their comprehensive paper on English, Chinese and Russian mismatching
cyber definitions, the common disparities need to be removed to achieve a mutual understanding on governing cyberspace. It
is easier to accept the current situation, but a better solution may exist in composing an international cyber lexicon that
addresses all the relevant terms. This, however, will be a tremendous challenge due to the opposition of China and other
alternative players like Russia, who find it more appealing to seek cooperation among themselves and other like-minded
countries instead of engaging into a constructive dialogue with the US-led English-speaking countries. See more at: Giles, Keir,

wider use).35 Similarly, while the West classifies cyberspace as the global domain covering the use of electronics,
interdependent networks of information technology infrastructure including the internet, and other
telecommunication networks and data,36 the Chinese term closest to what would translate as cyberspace merely
entails the necessary components of a connected device and actions related to using it.37 For the Chinese, cyberspace
is thus only a subset of information space – the landscape for the largest scale communication to the world’s
population, which includes human information processing and cognitive space. 38
It is also important to distinguish between cyber security and information security. The West, including the NATO
allies, sees cyber security as the security of computer and information systems as physical and logical entities, and
information assurance or information security as referring to security of the content. The Chinese, however, view
both the information systems and the content of information as integral and connected parts of information
security.39 This holistic understanding thus extends the use of the term from purely ICT-related issues to mental
aspects and explains why the Chinese government’s approach to information security has been control-seeking and
restrictive. Likewise, the Chinese have adopted information warfare as a distinct, yet integrated and discrete
discipline, which is incompatible with the Western view, which has recently been dividing the concept into smaller
and separate disciplines, such as psychological operations and strategic communications. The Chinese use cyber
warfare only when describing Western countries and their cyber operations. 40
It would be a major challenge to have each player adopt a single lexicon, but as long as one understands what is
behind the varying definitions, it will become easier to evaluate cyber relationships between China and the West. In
this paper, unless specifically referring to a Chinese initiative or particular concept, cyber and its derivations should
be read in the conventional Western understanding. However, dissimilar terminology is certainly not the hardest of
the obstacles on the way to elaborating sophisticated cyber cooperation between China and the West. China’s
notion of sovereignty and independence has restrained it from considering Western points of view and international
law’s efficiency in cyberspace. Reluctant to adopt the US-led positions, the Chinese prefer to control cyberspace
through its government and military, as opposed to the West which prefers a liberal environment, giving space to
individuals and private corporations. Having analysed China’s previous behaviour and firmly held attitudes, it seems
unlikely that its stance will see a significant change any time soon. Therefore, instead of fighting the red dragon in
the dark and without much success, it might be more useful to get to know her first. However, it is a large and
complicated task due to continuing uncertainties that are not only a problem for the outsiders, but also for the
Chinese themselves.

In 1999, colonels Qiao and Wang presented dependence on ICT-networks as the main weakness of the US military.
Today, the PLA has reached a point where its reliance on information technology is no less than that of the
Americans. At the same time, cyber security is also concerned with industrial and civilian developments where public
and private sector actors’ interests often mismatch, making it difficult to implement a streamlined approach.
Logically enough, cyber security has become one of the priorities for both the PLA and the Chinese government,
which has taken various steps to address the challenges of legal loopholes, incomplete institutions, and

unsatisfactory education among the public.41 As a bystander, it is not easy to understand what exactly China’s cyber
policies are built on, as rather than a single official document systematically listing out its cyber strategy, the policies
derive from several key founding documents that have been adopted over time and have been most influential in
policy-making in the cyber sphere. However, analysing these together allows gaining a rather sharp picture of China’s
overall position in cyberspace. Even though many of the adopted initiatives have seen only limited success, this
chapter will shed light on the most important documents together with their main content and goals. It will conclude
by analysing China’s new strategic direction taken after establishing the Central Leading Small Group for Internet
Security and Informatisation in February 2014.

Prior to establishing China’s national civilian cyber security plan, referred to as Document 27, several working groups
had touched upon related issues. However, lack of coordination and constant restructuring have continuously
caused much uncertainty for all the players. A national-level focus on information technology began in 1986 with
the establishment of the State Economic Information Management Leading Small Group, and continued in 1999 and
2001 with the establishment and re-establishment of the State Informatisation Leading Group (SILG). In 2003, the
State Network and Information Security Coordination Small Group (SNISCSG) was created as a sub-group under SILG,
chaired by the current Premier Li Keqiang. The objectives for these three groups were to develop indigenous
information technologies and place them into a national security context. 42 China’s tenth Five-Year Plan of 2001
prioritised developing domestic information security infrastructure and initiating large-scale investments to both
state-sponsored and private IT-firms, which were to focus on anti-malware protection and general internet
security.43 In the early 2000s, ICT development received attention from both President Jiang Zemin and President
Hu Jintao who started to talk about national security and economic security as an indivisible pair, hence promoting
the need to ‘leapfrog’ over the competitors in order to turn China’s historical disadvantages into strengths through
innovative development.44

In 2003, SNISCSG issued Document 27, which implemented major cyber security related policies and national
strategies, including disaster recovery, incident management and e-government security plans.45 The initially
classified Document 27’s persisting idea was the concept of ‘active defence’,46 drawing various policies for protecting
critical infrastructure, enhancing encryptions and dynamic monitoring, improving indigenous innovation, and also
touching upon cyber security’s leadership, better coordination and funding. Document 27 was helpful in formulating
necessary policies, but the dismissal of SNISCSG in 2008 left China’s civilian cyber security disorganised, leading to
various separate, unaligned policy initiatives from different bodies. Even though SNISCSG was reconstituted in 2009,
no open records of its meetings are available and various ministries have been assigned the responsibilities to

implement Document 27’s strategies.47 Materials in English about Document 27 are limited, and therefore the exact
directions on how and through which means the strategies were to be executed also remain unclear.

Since February 2006, all information security developments and related policies can in one way or another be linked
to China’s 15-year grand strategy for future innovation. Issued by the State Council, it is more precisely entitled the
‘The National Programme for the Development of Science and Technology in the Medium and Long Term 20062020’. Dieter Ernst from the East-West Centre considers this document a cornerstone to China’s overall
standardisation strategy, which consists of various legal documents and policy initiatives. He also believes that the
strategy should be analysed in a broader context with China’s goal to level up with the Western life quality and
income level, not only when talking about technology or cyberspace. In order to achieve that goal, instead of merely
accepting the current standards, the government wants to become a lead shaper, or at least a co-shaper, of
international standards through innovation.48 Accordingly, the document lists China’s goals for technological
indigenous innovation and recognises the need for increased investment in research and development.
Other research49 suggests that the plan reflects China’s resolve to overcome domestic, social and environmental
issues through technological innovation, while continuing with the firm understanding that only the government can
drive such innovation, guiding enterprises and the business sector which will execute the strategies. Perhaps the
most important aspect for the international community is Beijing’s strong determination to loosen ties with foreign
innovation firms and set the foundation for a truly independent base of knowledge. Concerns over the possibly of
an emergent ‘techno-nationalism’ seem therefore justified. The plan calls for China not to obtain any ‘core
technologies in key fields that affect the lifeblood of the national economy and national security’ from abroad,
including next-generation internet technologies, digitally controlled machine tools, and high-resolution earth
observation systems.50
In order to deliver this, the government has increased R&D expenditure which will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2020.
While it is believed that China will have overtaken the US by 2020, 51 estimated figures for China in 2016 remain
around 2%, or $396.3 billion, while those of the US are 2.77% and $514 billion, still maintaining a significant gap
between the two.52 Even though China’s figures show an almost two-fold increase from $213.4 in 201053, they need
to be taken with a degree of scepticism, as large part of the budget is spent on developing infrastructure, rather
than on scientific research. Nevertheless, Chinese researchers and enterprises do have increasingly more incentives
and support to develop intellectual property, fulfilling the government’s wish to reduce dependence on foreign
technologies. Despite good intentions, such policies may actually amplify industrial espionage, as many local
businesses lack the required skills and thus acquire the needed technology from abroad and simply modify it as
necessary, often illegally.54 Here, one can find another controversy: a part of the Chinese understanding of
‘indigenous’ highlights producing original innovations such as new products and services. 55 This seemingly

contradicts the purpose of Chinese cyber espionage, which allows the perpetrators to remain far from originality
and rely instead on already established models.
The 15-year strategy does not address any particularly military related goals or concerns. Its further aim is to
prioritise energy, water supply and environmental technologies together, and to recognise that a better position on
intellectual property rights would also strengthen China’s general competitiveness in the world markets. 56 However,
Timothy Thomas has brought out the plan’s aspects that could in some ways be associated with enhancing China’s
capabilities in the offensive side, considering the strategy a counterpart to the American National Military Strategy
for Cyberspace Operations.57 One interpretation of the strategy’s goal would therefore be the desire to secure the
home front before assaulting other countries. Indeed, given the intertwined nature of digital world, civilian
cyberspace is certainly the most vulnerable target and would suffer the most harm if successfully attacked. By
contrast, Dieter Ernst believes that the crux of this plan remains how to execute the key objective of indigenous
innovation while becoming more and more integrated into global corporate production networks, often led by
Western ideals.58
While the 15-year strategy has initiated the improvement of China’s innovation system, its success depends on
reinforcing open markets and international linkages between China’s technology and global standards, while
executing its domestic innovation and thus creating a ‘two-track’ approach.59 Indeed, China’s technology giants such
as Huawei and Xiaomi are gradually entering the world markets, but the opposite direction allowing foreign
technology firms to trade in China is still restricted. For example, the extensive ‘Multi-Level Protection Scheme’
introduced in 2007 intended to protect national security through prohibiting foreign companies from selling any
core products to the government, banking, transportation, and other critical infrastructure companies, and the 2010
‘Compulsory Certification for Information Security Scheme’ required that foreign companies wishing to sell to the
Chinese government must give their products’ intellectual property rights to the government. A continuation to that
trend in February 2015 saw the beginning of a ‘cyber security new regime’ which assumes that all foreign technology
firms supplying Chinese banks might be required to share their source code and even include back doors into
hardware and software.60 The attention that everything related to cyberspace and information technology is
continuously receiving shows that the Chinese have not given up their ambitions.

In July 2012, the State Council’s Information Office (SCIO) issued a New Policy Opinion (NPO), translated as ‘The State
Council vigorously promotes informatisation development and offers several opinions on conscientiously protecting
information security’.61 Even though released nearly a decade after Document 27 and more than half a decade after
the 15-year strategy, its overall concerns remain the same, showing that not all goals have been met. It persistently
notes China’s exposure to urgent challenges in international competition over the control, use and acquisition of
information. More precisely, the disparity between the West and China in digital infrastructure, inefficient exchange
of information between government and industry, poor cyber security planning, inadequate defence capabilities,
and a continuously large share of control over core technologies by foreigners attract the most attention. 62 Unlike
previous documents, the NPO connects developments in information security to people’s economic and social

improvement. This shows an expansion from ‘safeguarding national security information’ to ‘promoting stable and
rapid economic development and social harmony and stability’. 63
Giles and Hagestad have distilled the NPO’s four policy mandates, which like the previously analysed documents
focus on civil cyber defence:


Firstly, the NPO places strong emphasis on the security of all critical information systems and infrastructure,
especially focusing on information networks. This can be interpreted as an order, rather than guidance, on
what the policymakers must protect – the internet, radio networks and private telecommunications
systems, as well as information networks related to finance, energy and transportation. Its clear goal is to
secure those industries where a cyber attack would cause tremendous harm to China’s economy. 64



Secondly, the NPO seeks to strengthen the governmental and classified information security systems, which
are often attractive targets for hacktivists like Anonymous. For execution, the State Council expects the
government agencies to reduce their internet connectedness and enhance information security and
confidentiality protection monitoring by establishing a hierarchical system to protect classified information
systems.65



Thirdly, the NPO seeks to increase protection of industrial control systems of facilities such as oil and gas
pipelines, nuclear and power infrastructures, as well as transportation and urban facilities, all invoking the
memory of Stuxnet. This should be achieved through strengthening regulations and conducting more
frequent security checks and risk assessments. 66



Finally, the NPO turns to safeguarding Chinese citizens’ personal information, noting its significance in
achieving the general welfare of the country and thus promising protection of demographic, geographical
or similarly sensitive data.67 This step can be considered a countermove to an attack in 2012 which
compromised millions of users’ data on an opinion forum, Tianya, and a retail site, 360buy.com.68

The NPO is certainly a very comprehensive document, which covers the majority of essential areas of cyber security.
The State Council’s recommendations indicate the main weaknesses of China’s information security model, and
point out the increased vulnerabilities from growing dependence on the internet. Continuing hostility towards
foreign technologies also suggests that related trade barriers will not be abolished in the near future. However, as
an intriguing point in light of President Xi’s anti-corruption campaign, the NPO does not seem to address corruption,
which is widespread within the technology industry. As the crackdown has not proven fully successful, the
government could think of rewarding legitimate officials and entrepreneurs to prevent dishonest players from
compromising the industry’s development. Overall, the NPO indicates that information security had, by 2012,
already become one of the government’s priorities.

The analysis of these documents indicates that China’s main information security concerns have remained rather
similar throughout the years. Guided by these principles, 2014 was finally considered a year of breakthrough towards
a better regulated cyberspace. The establishment of the Central Leading Small Group for Internet Security and
Informatisation on 27 February 2014 shows President Xi’s personal commitment, as he is the first party head to chair

a leading small group related to information management.69 When explaining the necessity of the new body, Xi has
pointed out China’s need to catch up with the West in innovation, and further developed his argument that ‘no
internet safety means no national security and no informatisation means no modernization’.70 The leading group
gives unprecedented priority to both internet security and information management as a single concept, trying to
fight the lack of a coordinated approach that has caused problems in the past. President Xi has referred to internet
security and information management as ‘two wings of one bird, two wheels on one car’.71 With Xi as its head, the
new group should be able to make firm demands and solve internal discrepancies where necessary.
As part of the new initiative, November 2014 saw the first World Internet Conference, hosted in Wuzhen, China.
With the presence of representatives from various big names like Apple and Microsoft, President Xi affirmed that
under the terms of mutual respect and trust, China was willing to cooperate with other states to achieve a peaceful
cyberspace and a multilaterally governed, transparent internet, while sticking to the notion that state sovereignty
must be fully respected in cyberspace.72 At the second Conference a year later, President Xi delivered a keynote
speech in which he called for ‘building a cyber community of common destiny and put forward the principles of
respecting cyber sovereignty, safeguarding cyber security, encouraging cyber opening up, and building cyber
order’.73 As part of his ideas, Xi proposed building an internet governance system based on a multilateral approach,
and denounced unilateralism in which only a few parties discuss the future of the internet. 74 His other proposals
concerned the digital gap, cultural diversity in cyberspace, the digital economy, and cyber security in general,
indicating the core elements of China’s cyber strategy. While this call might be a chance for deeper cooperation with
China, it also impliedly depicts China’s dissatisfaction with the current system and the desire to guide the existing
structure and governance of cyberspace and technological development closer to their way of thinking. 75 Indeed, in
the National Meeting on Cyber Security and Information Technology held in April 2016, President Xi once again
reaffirmed the importance of cyber sovereignty, implying a rejection of the applicability of international law and
existing regulations in cyberspace.76
Overall, despite the lack of one single strategy clearly listing China’s future plans and ambitions, the different pieces
of information allow a number of conclusions. The existing and newly created mechanisms must improve the
security of the domestic internet infrastructure, reinforce the move towards indigenous innovation detailed in the
15-year plan, and, most importantly, help China become the leading actor on the global stage by promoting an
alternative attitude to internet governance. The Chinese government understands the value and power of
technology, innovation, and the internet, but remains extremely careful in operating the ‘double-edged sword’,
being aware that free information, once released, is impossible to stop and has great potential to shake the
foundation of the communist party and the political order of China. Last year, for example, the government set up
a doctrine of Seven Baselines for using the internet, requiring that whatever is expressed online, must respect seven
elements: laws and regulations, the socialist system, the country’s national interest, citizens’ lawful rights and

interests, public order, morality, and accuracy.77 Given this, it is likely that the government will continue with a
similar supervisory mind-set.

Institutional fragmentation has been a constant feature in China’s cyber organisation. A mixture of government
institutions and military departments, together with uncoordinated action between central and local authorities,
has created a strong incentive for establishing a more streamlined and synchronised approach. To give a clear
overview of the exact institutions in play, this chapter will introduce the past and recently launched initiatives that
shape China’s cyber governance, including Xi Jinping’s Central Leading Small Group for Internet Security and
Informatisation. The chapter will examine both civilian and military organs, and will first cover how the general
responsibility of cyber security is organised and coordinated by looking at the bodies responsible for the decisions
and execution.
The military part of the chapter first introduces the military’s strategic thought and then focuses on the role of the
People’s Liberation Army and its cyber espionage and intelligence units, which have previously acted mainly under
the 3rd and 4th Departments of the General Staff Department, but are expected to see a restructuring under the
newly created Strategic Support Force. This section also includes an analysis of the patriotic hacktivist groups which,
despite their usefulness to the government, may seriously hamper China’s overall development and foreign
relations.

As Amy Chang has noted, the key driver for formulating China’s cyber security strategy remains maintaining the
communist party’s ruling power.78 Therefore, as with any other subject, the party ultimately commands all the
mechanisms regulating China’s cyberspace. So far, it has not been able to effectively reduce the large number of
stakeholders with competing interests. However, like the noticeable trend in several other countries like Israel and
the US, China’s recent steps have allowed it to move towards a more streamlined unified command line for cyber.
The highest-level decision-makers in China are the Politburo Standing Committee, the State Council, and the Central
Military Commission. For policy-making, it is the State Council that usually adopts new initiatives, including those in
cyberspace, such as the 15-Year Plan in 2006 and the New Policy Opinion in 2012, but there are several government
agencies charged with the execution of policy. In 1982, when China was not even connected to the internet, the
State Council set up a government body for digital affairs, seeking to centralise control over the developing
79
‘computers and large-scale integrated circuits’. Groups with similar structures and roles remain the key
organisations today, but before turning to explaining their current functions, ministerial-level agencies which mostly
perform general policy implementation will be introduced:


The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) was established in 2008 as an attempt to
centralise information technology development. It undertakes all State Council work on information
management and carries similar domestic responsibilities to the Department of Homeland Security in the
US. It also sets standards, holds exercises, inspects network security, and coordinates information and
telecoms security through a special department. 80 Whereas the primary duty to respond to cyber-attacks
rests with the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Centre of
China (CNCERT) – a non-governmental technical centre established in 2002, MIIT has been influential in

16

supporting its work through helping it build virus and vulnerability databases, finding malicious IP and
domain name providers, and guiding CNCERT to engage in international cooperation. 81 MIIT also contains
the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND), which
drafts guidelines, policies, laws and regulations involved with science, technology and industry for national
defence.82 Prior to MIIT a separate ministry, the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defence (COSTIND), carried out similar tasks.


The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) investigates cybercrime and takes care of critical infrastructure
protection together with development work through a wide network of research labs.83 It is also responsible
for overseeing the commercial products used by the government and controlling all commercial
information security companies. Importantly, MPS operates the Great Firewall of China and is also involved
with conducting domestic intelligence.84



The Ministry of State Security (MSS) functions as an organ to conduct counterespionage,
counterintelligence, foreign intelligence, and domestic intelligence. Its efforts originally focused on
countering separatism, terrorism and religious extremism, which are often described as the three
existential challenges to the Communist Party. However, despite having attracted little public attention,
MSS’s estimated cyber capabilities have grown significantly in order to collect further political and economic
data on foreign governments, NGOs and domestic dissidents.85

Other than these institutions, various sources have also highlighted the importance of the State Encryption Bureau,
which conducts party, civilian and military encryption management, including restricting the import and export of
any encrypted devices; and the State Secrets Bureau, which manages all classified networks and has been
increasingly engaged in keeping up with the technological changes China is witnessing.86 As all of the three ministries
and the two bureaus operate under the State Council, they are seemingly equal in hierarchy. However, looking at
past actions and attention, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology seems to be the main force behind
executing the tangible progress of China’s cyberspace.
On the research and development side, further attention has been paid to a number of government affiliated
research institutions, such as the Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations, which acts directly
under MSS, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Not surprisingly, Tsinghua
University and Peking University, the top two academic institutions in China, are closely related to the government’s
information technology related research work. Deeper strategic development is run by the PLA through institutions
such as the Academy of Military Science and the PLA Information Engineering University. March 2016 saw the
launch of the Cyber Security Association of China, consisting of academic institutes, individuals and internet
companies such as Tencent, to speed up the development of industry standards and better coordinate research on
cyber security.87

Central leading groups and Leading small groups have become a common feature in China’s political culture to tackle
issues that the existing bureaucratic machine is incapable of solving. Complying directly with the orders of the party’s
highest leaders, these are perhaps the most efficient mechanisms to the adoption of successful reforms. Whereas
the State Informatisation Leading Group (SILG) and the State Network and Information Security Coordination
Small Group (SNISCSG) – the first efforts to develop China’s indigenous information technologies and formulate a
secure Chinese cyberspace – were guided by the State Council, the recently established Central Leading Small Group
for Internet Security and Informatisation (CLSGISI) acts directly under the direction of President Xi, and has thereby
assumed unprecedented authority. The leading group reportedly consists of 22 members: next to Xi Jinping, the
Premier Li Keqiang and a Standing Committee member Liu Yunshan act as vice-chairs, to lead eight other Politburo
members and eleven ministerial-level officials. As it is common in China for a new body to take over the duties of a
previously existing organ, this group has subsumed the roles of the SILG and SNISCSG, by merging most of the
members from the previous two bodies. 88 Next to the obvious significance of the group deriving from its high
leadership which shows cyber security’s weight in Chinese policy-making, the group is hoped to act as a middleman
resolving internal misunderstandings between the ministerial-level institutions described above.
More than two years after its establishment, the CLSGISI itself has not been much discussed in the English-speaking
media, but the executive body implementing President Xi’s reforms – the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)
– has caught its attention rather often. The CAC is basically a refreshment of the State Internet Information Office
(SIIO) as its Chinese name and chairman Lu Wei remained the same, although Lu unexpectedly stepped down in
June 2016 to be replaced by Xu Lin. SIIO was founded in 2011 to better coordinate the ‘rectification’ of the internet,
working in close cooperation with MIIT and MPS to patrol social media, where user-created content generates a
serious nuisance to the government. Establishing SIIO was a specific step by the State Council Information Office
(SCIO), which manages the general domestic information flow. 89 Seemingly tied with Xi’s power consolidation and
countering domestic disobedience, CAC’s predominant function remains the same as that of SIIO – to monitor
information movement and further strengthen the grip on websites allegedly undermining domestic stability.
The creation of CAC also represents an attempt to combine propaganda with technological innovation and
development.90 For example, CAC has published a choral anthem, which includes verses such as ‘with loyalty and
devotion, we watch over our domain day and night.’91 Affirming the significance of the future of China’s cyberspace,
Time Magazine included Lu Wei among the 100 most influential people in 2015, emphasising his (former) power to
pilot more than 700 million Chinese netizens. 92 CAC has so far executed its power by blocking foreign VPNs, closing
and monitoring WeChat (the most popular messaging application in China) accounts of individuals perceived as
threatening, and possibly coordinating cyber-attacks against anti-censorship groups such as GreatFire.org, an
organisation seeking to bring transparency to the Great Firewall by providing information on any blocked websites
and keywords.93 The beginning of 2016 saw a proposal for a new cyber security law that would include provisions
theoretically banning local service providers from enabling connections to sites with domain names registered

abroad. MIIT has, however, said that the core of the new regulations has been misunderstood, and they would not
affect foreign companies launching services in China or users accessing such websites.94 Despite the fact that the
second reading of the draft regulations in June 2016 saw certain amendments, the existing draft further reaffirms
the state’s strict approach to controlling cyberspace and is soon expected to become adopted as law.95
Each of these mentioned bodies has been trusted with specific tasks. While academia and specific institutions
conduct research and strategic development work, it is the ministerial-level organisations which come up with policy
initiatives and direct the required changes. Establishing the Central Leading Small Group for Internet Security and
Informatisation and the CAC as its executive body represents an additional step from the previously existing
bureaucracy, as their authoritative leadership guarantees a better coordinated action between the ministries and
bureaus. In terms of policy-making efficiency, it is a positive step towards a less fragmented system, but it also
constitutes a part of President Xi’s campaign to restrict anti-party and liberal movements through the opportunities
the internet creates, which is demonstrated by the CAC’s predominantly restricting activities.

The following sections will look more closely at China’s cyber security from the military’s strategic and organisational
perspective, which is intertwined with the goals and activities of the civilian agencies thus far discussed. While the
militaries of the US and Russia have each published official documents on activities in cyberspace, the PLA has not
issued any specific doctrine. However, the concept of information has always been extremely important in China’s
military strategies, and the contemporary emphasis on gathering information and intelligence is entirely in line with
ancient Chinese strategists such as Sun Zi. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the guiding principles of the PLA’s
conducts before engaging in analysing the specific activities of its cyber units.

The concept of information plays a central role in Chinese military thinking. As cyberspace is strongly related to
information, one can find relevant content within general military documents which explain the PLA’s ambitions in
cyberspace. For example, the Military Strategic Guidelines, normally renewed every 10-15-years, lead defence and
military policies strongly towards modernisation, while recognising the importance of the ability to fight in ‘technical
conditions’ and implying the significance of information technology in overall strategies. 96 Furthermore, the recently
updated Science of Military Strategy, a book issued by the Academy of Military Sciences, the most important
research institution of the PLA, puts even stronger emphasis on conflict in the network domain and elaborates on
developments of high-tech local war, giving guidelines on how to behave in such circumstances.97 In fact, its chapter
on information warfare openly declares that China does have specialised network warfare units, operating within
both the military and the civilian spheres, and carrying out both offensive and defensive cyber operations. 98
Another initiative was launched in October 2014 when President Xi and the Central Military Commission issued a
document entitled Opinion on Further Strengthening Military Information Security Work, which listed the basic
principles and priorities for the PLA, but also provided directives for the military in the information security field.99

In May 2015, the Chinese Ministry of National Defence issued China’s Military Strategy, also referred to as the 2015
Defence White Paper, which places intense focus on the informatisation of warfare, and declares China’s intention
to further develop cyber force and ‘enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence,
support for the country’s endeavours in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation’.100
Importantly, the document also reaffirms China’s goal to build an informationised military to be able to win future
informationised wars.101
China’s ambition to achieve superiority in cyberspace is related to the belief that disabling the enemy’s most valuable
operation systems in the initial phases of a conflict would bring a quick victory. Looking at the available documents,
it seems that China is moving towards a common approach that incorporates cyber war with a kinetic attack.102 This
also corresponds with the Chinese strategists’ hypothesis that informatisation creates a new battlefield which the
PLA must master.103 However, there are also pragmatic economic and political objectives behind the military’s cyber
activities, mainly short and long-term gains from espionage against other governments and the private sector. Next
to collecting valuable information from abroad, perhaps even more essential is the surveillance conducted against
the Chinese citizens in order to maintain control and political stability within the communist system. The main
targets normally include political dissidents and democracy activists, but also Tibetans, Uighurs and Falun Gong
followers to examine their networks and communication methods. 104 While these activities are not conducted only
through military mechanisms, the paper will later show that the PLA’s role is certainly vital in sustaining such
operations.
Interestingly, China has always emphasised its defensive nature in every aspect of warfare, including information
security. The 2013 Defence White Paper proclaimed China’s right to protect its interests of national security and
delivered a promise not to attack unless attacked first, including in cyberspace.105 Whereas several Western
countries have communicated a similar position, the Chinese attitude relies on Mao Zedong’s ‘active defence’ as
already emphasised in Document 27 in 2003, assuming to attack only after being attacked.106 Yet, Mao’s ‘active
defence’ can also be interpreted as the alternative use of defensive and offensive. This, together with different
strategic cultures, creates a situation where an act considered defensive by the Chinese might seem offensive to the
West.107 As an interesting parallel, ‘active cyber defence’ is widely discussed in the West, referring to the ability to
detect and mitigate key threats before suffering from any damage, including the capacity to launch aggressive and
offensive countermeasures.108 Thus, Western actions taken under the concept of ‘active cyber defence’ might
similarly seem offensive to the Chinese. Connecting the Chinese and the Western understandings of active defence,
it seems that each has understood that in cyberspace, mere defensive capabilities are not enough to deter
adversaries from attacking one’s networks. As the Chinese have recently admitted the existence of purely offensive
cyber units in the PLA, it is increasingly clear that conflict in cyberspace has achieved fundamental importance in the
Chinese understandings of policy making, both in peacetime, and in any future war.109

In 1986, China launched Programme 863 to catch up with the West in key strategic industries through foreign
intelligence collection, and to reduce its dependence on foreign technologies. The plan was intensified after the Gulf
War in 1991, when the PLA was stunned by the sophistication of US weaponry. 110 Relying on this imperative, the
Chinese military has implemented numerous reforms and modernisation plans, the latest and most comprehensive
of them approved in December 2015 to adjust to the 21 st century’s cyber era and exploit its opportunities. Parts of
the Chinese military have become useful tools for the government to conduct political and economic cyber
espionage, and also to help reduce the PLA’s own technological and strategic disadvantages relative to its
competitors.
Prior to the largest restructuring within the PLA’s modernisation drive, the General Staff Department’s
Communications Department was restructured into the Informatisation Department, together with establishing
several smaller information-related departments in the PLA regions and academia to raise the level of
informatisation in the PLA.111 However, it seems that these developments should not receive too much attention in
light of the reforms President Xi announced on the last day of 2015. Three new organs were introduced: the PLA
Rocket Force, the PLA Strategic Support Force, and the Army Leadership Organ. Importantly, the Rocket Force
assumed the responsibilities of the PLA Second Artillery Force and earned promotion to a status equal to the PLA
Army, Navy and Air Force. By today, it appears that the Strategic Support Force (SSF) has also been given a status
equal to these professional service branches, and will likely formulate the core of China’s information warfare effort
by comprising forces in the space, cyber and electromagnetic domains, thus finally bringing China’s military-related
informatisation activities under one umbrella. 112
However, the reforms are currently being implemented and the date of actual completion remains unknown.113 So
far, two (former) executive bodies of the PLA’s General Staff Department (GSD): the 3rd and the 4th Departments,
have been trusted with cyber intelligence and cyber-warfare respectively. Even though both departments will most
likely become integrated under the SSF, their successors’ corresponding goals and practices are expected to remain
similar, and therefore, it is appropriate to introduce these institutions in more detail.

Before giving full attention to the 3rd Department (3/PLA), sometimes also referred to as the Technical Department,
it is necessary to recall that the MSS carries similar intelligence responsibilities in the civilian side. Also, the General
Staff Department’s 2nd Department (2/PLA) is considered the conventional intelligence gathering agency and is
involved with collecting and analysing mainly open-source information through its global network of defence
attachés. Whereas it is not regularly engaged with covert operations, its non-official cover officers are believed to
have had significant success in collecting valuable data about US and other Western weapon systems. 114
Nevertheless, neither MSS nor 2/PLA have played as significant role in cyber intelligence as 3/PLA.
According to Nigel Inkster, 3/PLA has so far been the main operational force of the PLA’s cyber activities, as almost
all operations that have been tracked originate from its official premises.115 Appearing to be a counterpart to the
National Security Agency in the US, 3/PLA’s main focus has been on collecting signals intelligence (SIGINT). Before
the internet’s surge, it operated as a conventional SIGINT agency, but did not possess known overseas collection

capabilities matching those of the Americans or the British.116 More recently, its role has been narrowed to cyber
network exploitation (CNE) or espionage, and despite its presence in scandalous news stories quite often, 3/PLA has
proven to be a highly beneficial component of China’s military. At the same time, it has managed to remain rather
mysterious about its interactions with other domestic intelligence units, including the MSS, leaving open the
question of how efficient the coordination and information sharing among the domestic bodies is. Nevertheless,
looking at 3/PLA’s wide-ranging structure, traditional competence in SIGINT, its high performance in computing and
cryptology, and its status as China’s largest employer of professional linguists, one may assume its respective
importance, or even a central role among other institutions. 117 However, with the announced creation of the SSF, it
is likely that China’s strategic intelligence and informatisation units will be merged into one central intelligence
structure, leaving open the question of in what form 3/PLA will continue, if at all.
3/PLA’s headquarters is in Beijing, where it runs political and logistics departments together with the Science and
Technology Intelligence Bureau and the Science and Technology Equipment Bureau, which commands three
research institutes responsible for computing, sensor technology and cryptography, respectively named the 56th,
57th and 58th Research Institutes. In addition, 3/PLA manages or is affiliated with several Computer Network Defencerelated institutions such as the National Research Centre for Information Security Technology, the Information
Security Research Institute, and the PLA Communications Security Bureau.118 Next to these bodies, it is the 12
operational bureaus that play the most important role in 3/PLA’s structure. Each of the bureaus usually carries out
a specific task, for example intercepting radio or satellite communications, conducting cryptology, translation, or
intelligence analysis on diplomatic communications, foreign militaries, economic entities, educational institutions,
and individuals considered worthy of surveillance.119
The 2nd and 12th Bureaus deserve further attention.120 First, the Shanghai headquartered 2nd Bureau, also known as
Unit 61398 by its Military Unit Cover Designator, seems to specifically target the US and Canada to obtain political,
economic, and military intelligence. It was exposed in February 2013, when Mandiant published an unprecedentedly
thorough report on a unit they named APT-1, which has achieved public attention through its very similar missions,
capabilities, resources and location to the 2nd Bureau. After having observed APT-1’s long-term and extensive cyber
espionage operations for several years, Mandiant concluded that APT-1 is most likely government-funded and one
of the most prolific and dangerous of China’s cyber actors.121 According to the size of its physical infrastructure, APT1 is staffed by at least hundreds, if not thousands of people, all required to be competent in computer network
operations and English.122 Indeed, as Mandiant notes, 87% of APT-1’s victims are in English-speaking countries and
belong to industries that China has said to carry strategic importance to national growth. With the apparent help of
recruited linguists, malware authors and industry experts, APT-1 had by the time of the report’s publication obtained
hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations over 20 industries.123

A year after the Mandiant’s report, a threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike disclosed another unit of 3/PLA. Namely,
the 12th Bureau, or Unit 61486, also headquartered in Shanghai is believed to support China’s space surveillance
network and tasked to intercept satellite communications and collect space-based SIGINT.124 According to the
CrowdStrike report, the group, also called Putter Panda, has been active since 2007, allegedly targeting the
aerospace industries in both Europe and the US through attacks on the government, defence, research and
technology sectors. The group’s methodology relies on deploying malware through targeted emails in the form of
spear phishing.125 The uncovering of the 12th Bureau shows that China can use cyber espionage on two strategic
levels: illegally obtained intellectual property allows it to speed up its own space-related developments, but also
enables exploitation of an opponent’s satellite weaknesses during a real conflict.126
Evidently, collecting foreign intelligence through cyber espionage has been fully institutionalised and prioritised for
3/PLA. However, 3/PLA’s operations are often in parallel with those of the Military Region Technical Reconnaissance
Bureaus (TRB), which operate under seven military regions and are independent of 3/PLA. Like 3/PLA, the TRBs’
responsibilities include computer network exploitation, but also cryptology and communications intelligence. 127
Next to the military region TRBs, the PLA runs Service TRBs which intercept communications in areas related to their
interests, such as the air force or the navy.128

Even though the 4th Department (4/PLA) has received less attention than 3/PLA, it (or its respective future successor
under the SSF) is expected to fall under greater scrutiny due to the revelation of the existing network attack forces
in the 2015 edition of The Science of Military Strategy.129 Formerly known as the Electronic Countermeasures
Department, 4/PLA is the institution one should become familiar with when seeking to prepare for the increasingly
hyped danger of cyber war. Hierarchically the equal of 3/PLA, 4/PLA was traditionally responsible for electronic
warfare, but has recently also assumed the task of carrying out computer network attacks (CNA) 130 as a result of the
PLA’s adoption of an offensive information warfare doctrine, the Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),
which is an ‘organic combination of electronic warfare and computer network warfare’, as explained by General Dai
Qingmin, former Commander of 4/PLA.131 Therefore, unlike 3/PLA, this department’s mission is offensive, rather
than defensive electronic warfare or pure intelligence collection and analysis. 132 The simplest offensive activities
could be denial-of-service attacks to disrupt services or the use of worms or Trojan Horses to obtain sensitive data.
4/PLA can also engage in collecting electronic intelligence and providing tactical electronic support measures. 133
Furthermore, it manages electronic countermeasures (ECM) units, which have obtained increasing coverage in the
PLA media due to the increasing interconnection between information and electronic-based missions and

conventional army elements during military exercises. 134
Importantly, 4/PLA is also responsible for managing a number of research institutions related to developing new
ECM. Apparently, the most notable of these is the 54th Research Institute, which provides engineering support and
facilitates the department’s connection with other entities under the China Electronic Technology Corporation. For
training junior officers, 4/PLA runs the PLA Electronic Engineering Academy located in Hefei as the primary academic
electronic warfare centre in China.135 Interestingly, and again deriving from the Chinese historic understanding of
information as the key to victory, several of the research institutes under 4/PLA have focused on how to counter key
American C4ISR systems. Some of the methods include, for example GPS jamming, Joint Tactical Information
Distribution System countermeasures, and synthetic radar jamming. Such electronic warfare capabilities would be
coordinated with CNA tools to conduct a complete attack against the enemy’s key command and networks. 136
Regarding the interaction between the 3/PLA and 4/PLA, it is likely that some of their duties, such as R&D,
intelligence collection, or managing a joint network warfare training system overlap. 137 However, the offensive
nature of 4/PLA’s operations distinguishes it from 3/PLA and has thereby made it a centre of discussion on cyber
warfare. Yet, 3/PLA has undeniably been more attractive to foreign researchers due to its enduring cyber espionage
activities, which are currently more tangible than actual cyber war. What might indicate the next possible targets of
the PLA cyber units is China’s thirteenth five-year plan introduced in October 2015, which outlines the industries in
which China aims to achieve the most growth. Therefore, other than the defence sector, developers of clean energy,
electric cars, computer chips as well as healthcare should implement greater security in their online operations.138
However, it is important to bear in mind that the overall ‘Chinese cyber threat’ is often exemplified and not placed
into proper context, especially by the Americans. While not justifying China’s actions, Greg Austin, a well-regarded
China expert, draws attention to factors such as commercial lobbying and attention seeking by American cyber
security firms, a media environment too receptive to cyberspace intrigues and anti-China rhetoric, and the general
lack of knowledge even among the highest decision-makers on the details and conduct of the US’s own cyber
espionage and operations against China.139

The establishment of the Strategic Support Force (SSF) was somewhat unexpected for foreign observers, but it is
actually a logical step within the general modernisation of the PLA. For example, the launch of the PLA’s Cyberspace
Strategic Intelligence Research Centre in June 2014 to ‘provide strong support in obtaining high-quality intelligence
research findings and help China gain advantage in national information security’ already led observers to conclude
that the PLA’s focus was increasingly falling on cyberspace. 140 Indeed, as it seems that information warfare has
become central to China’s ‘active defence’ strategic concept, the SSF will likely become the main force behind its
execution, acting as a culmination of years of technological advancement and institutional change. 141 Moreover, as
the SSF will assume control over the PLA’s space and cyber operations, it will cover two aspects of China’s new

strategic ‘triad’ of nuclear, space, and cyber forces, which were noted as the three ‘critical domains’ in the 2015
Defence White Paper.142
While detailed information about the SSF’s structure remains limited, several Chinese military experts have
commented on the new initiative. For example, a former officer Song Zhongping stated that the SFF will be
composed of three separate forces: space troops (recognition and navigation satellites), cyber troops (offensive and
defensive hacking), and electronic warfare forces (jamming and disrupting radars and communications). 143
Additionally, Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo of the PLA Navy and who is believed to have direct links to the SSF’s creation
said in January 2016 that its main task will be ensuring the military’s local advantages in aerospace, space, cyber,
and electromagnetic battlefields through operations such as target tracking and reconnaissance, satellite navigation,
and attack and defence in cyber and electromagnetic spaces – the underlying goal of which should be attaining
victory in future wars. Yin also believes the SSF will assume responsibilities in defending the civilian infrastructure to
increase the security of China’s financial institutions as well as people’s daily lives in general.144 Indeed, greater
assimilation with the civilian sector seems essential in executing China’s cyber ambitions given the rapidly growing
dependence on information technology as well as the potentially dangerous aspect of informatisation to the current
regime.
It thus appears that the SSF will be responsible for every aspect of information warfare, including intelligence,
technical reconnaissance, cyber warfare, and electronic warfare, which are central to China’s strategic thinking on
asymmetric warfare and pre-emptive attack. In a larger picture, this and other ongoing military reforms aim to
streamline the military activities into a ‘combined wartime and peacetime military footing’, which should give the
country an advantageous position should a war break out against a technologically advanced opponent, such as the
US.145 Overall, this desired dominance in the information space forms an essential part of China’s strategic thinking,
which sees paralysing and sabotaging the enemy’s operational and command systems as a key to achieving
dominance in all other domains, air, sea, and land.146
Inevitably, the creation of the SSF and other radical changes in the structure of the PLA have brought about a
reshuffling difficult to follow. Announced in February 2016, the previous seven military area commands were
regrouped into five geographical theatre commands. This also meant a reorganisation of the General Staff
Department, under which 3/PLA and 4/PLA have so far operated, into the Joint General Staff Department, which will
not have operational control of the army unlike its predecessor.147 Regarding the SSF, it will most likely draw forces
from both 3/PLA and 4/PLA, as well as 1/PLA (operations), 2/PLA (intelligence), and the Informatisation Department,
which is expected to move under the SSF entirely. This means a significant increase in efficiency when it comes to
China’s cyber-related operations, as computer network attack and defence, technical reconnaissance, espionage,
electronic countermeasures, intelligence, as well as majority of communications and information management will
all be operating under one command.148
Overall, the creation of the SSF is a landmark development, giving a clear indication of the PLA’s focus on
informationised warfare, which raises questions of whether these actions should be seen as provocative

preparations for an overt conflict, or merely to provide China with more credible deterrence in the face of
technologically advanced Western powers. The developments must also be seen in political context, as it shifts
control over China’s most powerful and strategically important weapons from the army to the Central Military
Commission, headed by President Xi.149

Other than the PLA cyber units, various other groups operate from the Chinese cyberspace. Research by Jeffrey
Kwong in 2012 suggested that most of the openly confirmed attacks actually originated from such independent
hacktivist units. Even though the assertion was made more than four years ago, it should not be disregarded as it
relies on data from 1990 to 2012 and thus enables the assertion of an interesting theory: whenever the Chinese lack
influence over foreign threats, attacks by independent units increase China’s credibility in the opponent’s eyes.
Kwong brings out clear evidence that the government’s threats against another country are directly followed by
widespread cyber-attacks to increase domestic and international credibility. Since the groups are uncontrolled and
more nationalistic than the state, they create a risk of domestic unrest if the government should decide to retreat
from its demands. Therefore, the Chinese government faces a double threat from cyber-attacks: adopting too mild
approach against the opponent could invite the attacker groups to turn against China to express displeasure; while
letting the groups go completely untamed creates a risk of falling into a bilateral conflict with another state. 150
An example of such a group is the Red Hacker Alliance. The group has not been widely covered in the media, but it
is believed to have a membership of several hundred thousand. It has been noted that the government tolerates
and most likely even supports the group because of the large quantity of stolen data available from its members. At
the same time, while the Red Hacker Alliance is afraid of a crackdown on its activities, the government fears an
online rebellion by the hacktivists if it decides to oppose them. 151 Overall, it is an intriguing paradox that the Chinese
government needs to address. However, despite the risk of becoming malicious against the motherland itself, or the
chance of cyber incidents spiralling out of control, the groups have efficiently proven their value and are thus unlikely
to fall under more serious control by the government.
Slightly different from the above described organs is the so-called ‘cyber militias’, which consist of hackers, IT
companies, scientists, network engineers, foreign language speakers, and others with useful skills. Their main
mission is to take part in military exercises as part of the National Emergency Drill Structure. However, they are not
directly managed by the PLA in order to avoid the possible ambiguity over their combatant status and activities. 152
The cyber militias are seen as part of the effort to enhance civil-military cooperation within the country and were
even impliedly provided with a strategic impetus in the civilian 15-year strategy issued in 2006.153 Contrary to
popular belief, the groups tend to have a rather defensive nature, and conduct training missions for the PLA
operators and research on cyber warfare.154 Consisting of over eight million citizens, all related to Chinese
developmental programmes, it is a powerful force. While open source information on who controls such a large
number of people remains unavailable, it is believed that the cyber militia are commanded through hierarchical
layers of administration similar to a regular militia. However, the extent of the cyber militia’s connections and

accountability to the government and the PLA remain unclear and deserves further examination.155
As a concluding remark on the military’s role regarding China’s overall use of cyberspace, it has undoubtedly
achieved much in coming closer to its ultimate goal of mastering information – both foreign and domestic – to ensure
the state’s stability and exploit the opportunities arising from cyber espionage. Having worked hand in hand with
the government, 3/PLA and 4/PLA had so far played a critical role in executing China’s overall ambition to catch up
with Western technological development, and also obtain economic and political advantage in order to increase
China’s international bargaining power. As the responsibilities of these two departments have likely been integrated
into the Strategic Support Force, the efficiency of China’s state-led cyber operations is further expected to increase
and the intense focus on information warfare indicates China’s ability to adapt its military force to the changing
nature of international conflict. Simultaneously, the patriotic hacking units are in a way trying to help the
government, but also risk harming China’s reputation and other countries’ willingness to cooperate, which is already
hampered by the PLA’s cyber units’ activities. Yet, the Chinese government is unlikely to put a stop to further
development of cyber espionage and cyber warfare capabilities, and perhaps rightfully so, looking at similar
surveillance activities of its main competitors and potential adversaries on the international arena.
