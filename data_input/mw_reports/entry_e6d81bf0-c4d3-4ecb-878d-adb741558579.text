McAfee Labs have been observing a spike in phishing campaigns that utilize Microsoft office macro capabilities. These malicious documents
reach victims via mass spam E-mail campaigns and generally invoke urgency, fear, or similar emotions, leading unsuspecting users to
promptly open them. The purpose of these spam operations is to deliver malicious payloads to as many people as possible.
A recent spam campaign was using malicious word documents to download and execute the Ursnif trojan. Ursnif is a high-risk trojan designed
to record various sensitive information. It typically archives this sensitive data and sends it back to a command-and-control server.
This blog describes how attackers use document properties and a few other techniques to download and execute the Ursnif trojan.

Threat Summary
The initial attack vector is a phishing email with a Microsoft Word document attachment.
Upon opening the document, VBA executes a malicious shellcode
Shellcode downloads the remote payload, Ursnif, and invokes rundll32.exe to execute it.

Infection Chain
The malware arrives through a phishing email containing a Microsoft Word document as an attachment. When the document is opened and
macros are enabled, Word downloads a DLL (Ursnif payload). The Ursnif payload is then executed using rundll32.exe

Word Analysis
Macros are disabled by default and the malware authors are aware of this and hence present an image to entice the victims into enabling
them.

VBA Macro Analysis of Word Document
Analyzing the sample statically with ‘oleId’ and ‘olevba’ indicates the suspicious vectors..

The VBA Macro is compatible with x32 and x64 architectures and is highly obfuscated as seen in Figure-5

To get a better understanding of the functionality, we have de-obfuscated the contents in the 2 figures shown below.

An interesting characteristic of this sample is that some of the strings like CLSID, URL for downloading Ursnif, and environment variables
names are stored in custom document properties in reverse. As shown in Figure-7, VBA function
“ActiveDocument.CustomDocumentProperties()” is used to retrieve the properties and uses “StrReverse” to reverse the contents.
We can see the document properties in Figure-8

Payload Download and Execution:
The malicious macro retrieves hidden shellcode from a custom property named “Company” using the “cdec” function that converts the
shellcode from string to decimal/hex value and executes it. The shellcode is shown below.

The shellcode is written to memory and the access protection is changed to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE.

and protection after calling VirtualProtect()
After adding the shellcode in memory, the environment variable containing the malicious URL of Ursnif payload is created. This Environment
variable will be later used by the shellcode.

variable set in Winword.exe space
The shellcode is executed with the use of the SetTimer API. SetTimer creates a timer with the specified time-out value mentioned and notifies
a function when the time is elapsed. The 4th parameter used to call SetTimer is the pointer to the shellcode in memory which will be invoked
when the mentioned time is elapsed.

Figure 13- SetTimer

function (Execution of shellCode)
The shellcode downloads the file from the URL stored in the environmental variable and stores it as ” y9C4A.tmp.dll ” and executes it with
rundll32.exe.

Conclusion
Macros are disabled by default in Microsoft Office applications, we suggest keeping it that way unless the document is received from a trusted
source. The infection chain discussed in the blog is not limited to Word or Excel. Further threats may use other live-off-the-land tools to
download its payloads.
McAfee customers are protected against the malicious files and sites detailed in this blog with McAfee LiveSafe/Total Protection and McAfee
