Article Summary
In April 2019, enSilo detected what it believes to be new activity by Chinese cyber
espionage group APT10. The variants discovered by enSilo are previously unknown and
deploy malware that is unique to the threat actor. These malware families have a rich
history of being used in many targeted attacks against government and private
organizations. The activity surfaced in Southeast Asia, a region where APT10 frequently
operates.

Overview
Towards the end of April 2019, we tracked down what we believe to be new activity by
APT10, a Chinese cyber espionage group. Both of the loader’s variants and their various
payloads that we analyzed share similar Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
and code associated with APT10.

Although they deliver different payloads to the victim's machine, both variants drop the
following ﬁles beforehand:
jjs.exe - legitimate executable
jli.dll - malicious DLL
msvcrt100.dll - legitimate Microsoft C Runtime DLL
svchost.bin - binary ﬁle

jjs.exe is a JVM-based implementation of a javascript engine as part of the Java platform
developed by Oracle, but in this case it served as a loader for the malware.
Among the payloads we found are PlugX and Quasar RATs. The former is well known to
be developed in-house by the group with a rich history of being used in many targeted
attacks against different government and private organizations. PlugX is a modular
structured malware that has many different operational plugins such as communication
compression and encryption, network enumeration, ﬁles interaction, remote shell
operations and more.
The samples we analyzed originated from the Philippines. APT10 frequently targets the
Southeast Asia region.
In this article we examine both versions of the loader along with their payloads, TTPs
and Command and Control (C&C) server information.

Loader
Abusing a Legitimate Executable
The loader starts out by running a legitimate executable which is abused to load a
malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one which it is depended on. The method is known
as DLL Side-Loading.

In both variants, the abused executable is jjs.exe which loads jli.dll. The DLL exports the
following functions:
JLI_CmdToArgs
JLI_GetStdArgs
JLI_GetStdArgc
JLI_MemAlloc
JLI_Launch

The ﬁrst function called by jjs.exe is JLI_CmdToArgs which is implemented by the
malware author and behaves differently in each variant.

Running The Payload

The malicious DLL maps the data ﬁle, svchost.bin, to memory and decrypt it. The
decrypted content is a shellcode that is injected into svchost.exe and contains the actual
malicious payload.

The decryption process resembles previous versions used by the group in
PlugX\RedLeaves.

Figure 1: Decryption of the binary ﬁle
The injection ﬂow is rather simple and being done by creating a process in suspended
state, allocating memory with VirtualAllocEx, writing the shellcode with
WriteProcessMemory and running it using CreateRemoteThread. The complete
execution ﬂow is visualized by ﬁgure 2 below.

Variant 1

The ﬁrst variant uses a service as its persistency method. It installs itself (jjs.exe) as the
service and starts it. When running in the context of the service it performs the
decryption and injection as described above.

We have observed the variant delivering both Quasar and PlugX, which we’ll discuss
later on.

Among the different samples we tested, we encountered the following service names
being registered:
WxUpdateServiceInfo
HxUpdateServiceInfo
WinDefendSec
Web_Client
clr_optimization_v4.0.30319_31
clr_optimization_v4.0.30319_37

Variant 2

Unlike the ﬁrst variant, this variant uses the Run registry key for the current user under
the name “Windows Updata” to ensure its persistency rather than installing a service.
This variant delivered the same PlugX DLL, same as the ﬁrst loader.

Payloads
Modiﬁed Quasar RAT

The injected shellcode reﬂective loads in-memory an executable it reconstructs from
data which is bundled with it. The reﬂective load code is obfuscated, as function calls are
made by dynamically resolving their addresses according to hashed values.

The executable tries to run conhost.exe from C:\Users\Public\Documents and in case it
doesn’t exists it turns to ffca[.]caibi379[.]com to download it. The code that sends the
HTTP request seems to be buggy. While wininet!InternetOpenW (the unicode version of
the function) is used, an ascii value is provided as the User-Agent, so instead of
“RookIE/1.0” the request headers will include inconsistent and meaningless values as
can be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3: .NET downloader’s HTTP request
In our analysis the conhost.exe that was downloaded is itself another downloader written
in .NET and disguised as a legitimate system executable.

This extremely simpliﬁed downloader contains only the capability of downloading and
executing a base-64 encoded executable from the hardcoded address using a simple
System.Net.WebClient HTTP request: ffca[.]caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt.

The downloaded payload is a modiﬁed Quasar RAT. This version contains an addition of
SharpSploit to extract passwords from the victim machine using the framework’s built-in
mimikatz capabilities.

Examining the sample’s conﬁguration, we found the following:
C&C server: cahe.microsofts.org:443
Mutex name: “QSR_MUTEX_rSifQNOVTwHrsBs2nd”
A self-signed certiﬁcate issued to “MSGQ Server CA” (as seen in Figure 6)

PlugX
Following the injection to svchost.exe by the loader, the shellcode decrypts another part
of itself and use RtlDecompressBuffer API to further unpack the PlugX DLL. The DOS
and NT headers magic values, MZ and PE respectively, were replaced with VX, a typical
behavior for PlugX payloads. This is meant to prevent from security products and
automated tools to identify the executable headers when performing memory scans.

Like previous versions of PlugX, it collects information about the infected machine such
as the computer name, username, OS version, RAM usage, network interfaces and
resources.
In an attempt to generate noise around allocation and release of memory by the
malware, the authors wrapped it with dummy calls to GetForegroundWindow API
function, as can be seen in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Dummy calls to GetForegroundWindow
This sample shares some similarities to the Paranoid PlugX variant. It goes a long way
to completely remove any sign of McAfee’s email proxy service from the infected
machine. Besides killing the process, it also makes sure to delete any related keys in the
registry, and recursively deletes any related ﬁles and directories on the machine. The
same behavior was observed by in the paranoid variant as part of a VBScript the
dropper runs.

Typically, APT10 tends to employ a namesquatting scheme in their domains that aims to
confuse the observer by posing as a legitimate domain. In the conﬁguration bundled to
the samples we found the following:
The sample in the ﬁrst loader communicates with update[.]microsofts[.]org with
DNS over TCP.
The sample in the second loader communicates with update[.]kaspresksy[.]com
over HTTPS.

Threat Intelligence
When examining the ﬁrst loader variant’s domain (ffca[.]caibi379[.]com), we discovered
that it resolved to the following IP addresses according to VirusTotal:

27.102.127.75

While all the IP address ranges are listed under “DAOU TECHNOLOGY” in South Korea
and the domain itself was registered in Hong Kong.

Reverse lookup on the IP addresses shows that some of them used to be resolved from
another domain - *[.]microsofts[.]org. As mentioned before, cahe.microsofts.org is the
command and control server for the Quasar payload and update.microsofts.org for the
PlugX payload delivered by the ﬁrst loader variant.

The PlugX’s domains resolve to the following addresses:

2019-03-15

27.102.127.80

While looking at the other subdomains of kaspresksy[.]com we discovered that:
download[.]kaspresksy[.]com resolves to 27.102.113.118
api[.]kaspresksy[.]com resolves to 27.102.114.246

27.102.114.246 used to previously resolved from the following domains:
smsapi[.]tencentchat[.]net
onedrive[.]miscrosofts[.]com

We noticed a password protected zip named “Chrome_Updata” being associated with
the download[.]kaspresksy[.]com domain. The zip contained a sample of the Poison Ivy
malware which is also known to be used by APT10. The same executable was also seen
communicating with 27.102.115.249, which also appeared to be mapped to
update[.]kaspresksy[.]com.

All of the overlaps in the network infrastructure make it very reasonable to assume that
the same group is operating the two variants.

Uncovering New Activity By APT10

Both variants of the loader implement the same decryption and injection mechanism.

Looking at the history of APT10, one can notice major similarities in the details we
brought in this post:
Bundle of legitimate executable to sideload a custom DLL along with storing the
payload in a separate, encrypted ﬁle.
Use of typosquatting domain names similar to real, legitimate tech companies.
Unique malware families both developed by, and associated with, the group.
Using C&C servers located in South Korea.

Some of the mentioned domain mappings were recently updated. Also, the certiﬁcate
embedded in the Quasar sample was issued at 22.12.2018, which correlates with the
ﬁle’s compilation date. This can indicate that these samples may be a part of a testing
environment or a short-lived attack that is already ﬁnished. Either way, it’s safe to say
that the threat actor behind APT10 is still active and we have yet to see the last of the
group.
