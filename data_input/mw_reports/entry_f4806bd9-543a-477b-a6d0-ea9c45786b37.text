Researchers report a new version of the JSSLoader remote access trojan being distributed
via malicious Microsoft Excel addins.
The particular RAT (remote access trojan) has been circulated in the wild since December
2020, linked to the financially-motivated Russian hacking group FIN7, also known as
“Carbanak.”
JSSLoader is a small, lightweight RAT that can perform data exfiltration, establish
persistence, fetch and load additional payloads, auto-update itself, and more.

The latest campaign involving a stealthier new version of JSSLoader was observed by threat
analysts at Morphisec Labs, who say the delivery mechanism is currently phishing emails
with XLL or XLM attachments.
Abuse of Excel XLL add-ins isn’t new, as they are commonly used for legitimate purposes,
such as importing data into a worksheet or extending the functionality of Excel.
In the ongoing campaign, however, the threat actors use an unsigned file, so Excel will show
the victim a clear warning about the risks of executing it.

When enabled, the XLL files use malicious code inside an xlAutoOpen function to load itself
into memory and then download the payload from a remote server and execute it as a new
process via an API call.

More sophisticated obfuscation
The threat actor regularly refreshes the User-Agent on the XLL files to evade EDRs that
consolidate detection information from the entire network.

Compared to older versions, the new JSSLoader has the same execution flow, but it now
comes with a new layer of string obfuscation that includes renaming all functions and
variables.

To evade detection from string-based YARA rules used by defenders, the new RAT has split
the strings into sub-strings and concatenates them at runtime.

Finally, the string decoding mechanism is simple so as to leave a minimal footprint and
reduce the chances of being detected by static threat scanners.
Morphisec reports that these new additions combined with the XLL file delivery are enough
to prevent detection from next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint detection and
response (EDR) solutions challenging or even implausible.
This enables FIN7 to move in the compromised network undeterred for several days or
weeks before the defenders load matching signatures on tools that complement AI-based
detection solutions.
FIN7 is a resourceful threat group that has previously delivered malware-laced USBs
alongside teddy bear gifts, attempted to hire network penetration experts by posing as a
legitimate security firm, and sent ransomware-carrying USBs via post mail.
The new and stealthier version of JSSLoader is only one part of their arsenal, helping them
hide in networks for longer without being detected and stopped.
