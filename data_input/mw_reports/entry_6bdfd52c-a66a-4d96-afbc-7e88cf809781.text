Operation Electric Powder – Who is targeting Israel
Electric Company?
Posted on March 14, 2017 by ClearSky Research Team
Attackers have been trying to breach IEC (Israel Electric Company) in a year-long campaign.
From April 2016 until at least February 2017, attackers have been spreading malware via fake Facebook pro les and pages, breached
websites, self-hosted and cloud based websites. Various artifacts indicate that the main target of this campaign is IEC – Israel Electric
Company. These include domains, le names, Java package names, and Facebook activity. We dubbed this campaign “Operation Electric
Powder“.
Israel Electric Company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Electric_Corporation) (also known as Israel Electric Corporation) “is the largest
supplier of electrical power in Israel. The IEC builds, maintains, and operates power generation stations, sub-stations, as well as transmission
and distribution networks. The company is the sole integrated electric utility in the State of Israel. It installed generating capacity represents
about 75% of the total electricity production capacity in the country.”
It is notable that the operational level and the technological sophistication of the attackers are not high. Also, they are having hard time
preparing decoy documents and websites in Hebrew and English. Therefore, in most cases a vigilant target should be able to notice the
attack and avoid infection. We do not have indication that the attacks succeeded in infecting IEC related computers or stealing information.
Currently we do not know who is behind Operation Electric Powder or what its objectives are. See further discussion in the Attribution
section.

Impersonating Israeli news site
The attackers registered and used in multiple attacks the domain ynetnewes[.]com (note the extra e). This domain impersonates
ynetnews.com, the English version of ynet.co.il – one of Israel’s most popular news sites.
Certain pages within the domain would load the legitimate Ynet website:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ynet-redirect.png)
Others, which are opened as decoy during malware infection, had copied content from a di erent news site:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ynetnewes-1.jpg)
The URL ynetnewes[.]com/video/New lm.html contained an article about Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard copied from another site
(http://www.nrg.co.il/online/47/ART2/830/912.html). At the bottom was a link saying “Here For Watch It !”:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ynetnewes.jpg)
The link pointed to goo[.]gl/zxhJxu (Google’s URL shortening service). According to the statistics page
(https://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/zxhJxu/all_time), it had been created on September 25, 2016 and have been clicked only 11 times. When
clicked, it would redirect to iecr[.]co/info/index_info.php .
We do not know what was the content in the nal URL. We estimate that it served malware. The domain iecr[.]co was used as a command
and control server for other malware in this campaign.
Another URL, http://ynetnewes[.]com/resources/assets/downloads/svchost.exe
hosted a malware le called program_stream_ lm_for_watch.exe.

Fake Facebook pro le – Linda Santos
One of the above mentioned malicious URLs was spread via comments by a fake Facebook pro le – Linda Santos (no longer available
(https://www.facebook.com/pro le.php?id=100012012675632)):

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Linda-santos.png)
In September 2016, the fake pro le commented to posts by Israel Electric Company:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/iec-comment.png)

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Picture1.png)
The pro le had dozens of friends, almost all were IEC employees:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/iec-friends.jpg)
The fake pro le was following only three pages, one of which was the IEC o cial page:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/follwing.png)

Pokemon Go Facebook page
In July 2016, when mobile game “Pokemon Go” was at the peak of its popularity, the attackers created a Facebook page impersonating the
o cial Pokemon Go page:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Pokémon-Go.jpg)
The page (https://www.facebook.com/Pokemon-Go-1683341815318370/), which is no longer available, had about one hundred followers –
most were Arab Israelis and some were Jewish Israelis.
Only one post was published, with text in English and Hebrew. Grammatical mistakes indicate the attackers are not native to both
languages:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed.png)
The post linked to a malicious website hosted in yolasite.com (which is a legitimate website building and hosting platform):
pokemonisrael.yolasite[.]com

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/03/pokemonisrael.yolasite.com_.jpg)
The button – “‫( ”להורדה טלפון ומחשב‬literal translation – “To download phone and computer”) linked to a zip le in another website:
http://iec-co-il[.]com/iec/electricity/Pokemon-PC.zip

Note that the domain being impersonated is that of Israel Electric Company’s website (iec.co.il).
Pokemon-PC.zip (40303cd6abe7004659ca3447767e4eb7
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/e5f3adf2e7d34a23f37e4ed754fd57f23d40f0bf67b12c6b9f854195362a75ab/analysis/)) contained
Pokemon-PC.exe (e45119a72677ed15ee0f04ef936a9803
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/0ab1b7ee daeb0d554a6378e09728fed6cf8cb22b8e797e1570ec01843ab83b/analysis/)), which at run
time drops monitar.exe (d3e0b129bad263e6c0dcb1a9da55978b
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/3a36bee1411da9ce3fd5a287ce43e8943e4b1fc5abe62926a0a3a9db9a4f2ee9/analysis/)):

Android phone malware
The attackers also distributed a malicious app for Android devices – pokemon.apk (3137448e0cb7ad83c433a27b6dbfb090
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/329c764c75e3cc257f25c5ae7b44fa9b0dcd8cada12f23e44a789d26c90e04df/analysis/)). This malware also
had characteristics that impersonate IEC, such as the package name:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/iec-apk.jpg)
The application is a dropper that extracts and installs a spyware. The dropper does not ask for any permission during installation:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mobile1.png)
However, when the spyware is installed, it asks for multiple sensitive permissions:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mobile2.png)
The victim ends up with two applications installed on their device. The Dropper, pretending to be a Pokemon Go app, adds an icon to the
phone dashboard. However, it does not have any functionality, and when clicked, this error message is displayed:
Error 505
Sorry, this version is not compatible with your android version.

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mobile3.png)
The dropper does not really check what android version is installed:

(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mobile4.png)
The message is intended to make the victim believe that the Pokemon game does not work because of compatibility issues.
The victim is likely to uninstall the application at this point. However, because a second application was installed, the phone would stay
infected unless it is uninstalled as well.

Websites for Malware distribution
Malware was also hosted in legitimate breached Israeli websites, such as this educational website:
http://www.bagrut3.org[.]il/upload/edu_shlishit/passwordlist.exe (defc340825cf56f18b5ba688e6695e68
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/15b5fb226689fdddc04c3e6ddeb84e3aae4ce009cc4c95f6fa68045033ca905f/analysis/))
and a small law rm’s website:
http://sheinin[.]co.il/MyPhoto.zip (650fcd25a917b37485c48616f6e17712
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/9631d1574b11217ecdaa496696f25027a0fae7d83f4c3c1d71c2bf0dcbf9ea1e/analysis/1480916388/))
In journey-in-israel[.]com, the attackers inserted an exploit code for CVE-2014-6332 – a Windows code execution vulnerability. The exploit was
copied from an online source, likely from here, (https://gist.github.com/worawit/84ab41358b8465966224)as the code included the same
comments. The website also hosted this malware: afd5288d9aeb0c3ef7b37becb7ed4d5c
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/09c4bd14f67ad09dd3a6cc7aea3dad824732b0837a82bae03db7b3b98cfe2cbd/analysis/).
In other cases, the attackers registered and built malicious websites: users-management[.]com and sourcefarge[.]net (similar to legitimate
software website sourceforge.net). The latter was redirecting to journey-in-israel[.]com and iec-co-il[.]com in May and July 2016, according to
PassiveTotal (https://passivetotal.org/search/sourcefarge.net):

When run, while putty is installed, the html le is opened in a browser and redirects to http://tinyurl[.]com/jerhz2a and then to http://usersmanagement[.]com/info/index_info.php?id=9775. The last page 302 redirects to the website of an Israeli o ce supply company Ma l:

computer:

Windows Malware
The attackers developed three malware types for Windows based computers:
Dropper – self-extracting archives that extract and run the backdoor, sometimes while opening a decoy PDF document or website.
(For example: 6fa869f17b703a1282b8f386d0d87bd4)
Trojan backdoor / downloader – malware that collects information about the system and can download and execute other les.
(909125d1de7ac584c15f81a34262846f)
Some samples had two hardcoded command and control servers: iecrs[.]co and iecr[.]co (note once again the use of IEC in the domain
name).
Keylogger / screen grabber – records keystrokes and takes screenshots. The malware le is compiled Python code.
(d3e0b129bad263e6c0dcb1a9da55978b

An analysis of the malware and other parts of the campaign was published by Mcafee
(https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/PRODUCT_DOCUMENTATION/26000/PD26760/en_US/McAfee_Labs_Threat_Adviso
in on November 11, 2016.
The latest known sample in this campaign (7ceac3389a5c97a3008aae9a270c706a
(https://www.virustotal.com/en/ le/21023f43749e1efa394eeaa486a5cd332d64cabc9bb28a1640a252fd43062384/analysis/)) has compilation
timestamp of February 12, 2017. It is dropped when “pdf le products israel electric.exe” (c13c566b079258bf0782d9fb64612529

Attribution

In a report
(https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/PRODUCT_DOCUMENTATION/26000/PD26760/en_US/McAfee_Labs_Threat_Adviso
covers other parts of the campaign, Mcafee attribute it to Gaza Cybergang (AKA Gaza Hacker Team AKA Molerats). However, the report does
not present strong evidence to support this conclusion.
While initially we thought the same, currently we cannot relate Operation Electric Powder to any known group. Moreover, besides Mohamad
potentially being the name of the malware developer (based on PDB string found in multiple
samples: C:\Users\Mohammed.MU\Desktop\AM\programming\C\tsDownloader\Release\tsDownloader.pdb
), we do not have evidence that the attackers are Arabs.

Indicators of compromise
