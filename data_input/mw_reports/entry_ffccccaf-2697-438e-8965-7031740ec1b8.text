When the phones and computer networks went down at Ridgeview Medical Center’s three
hospitals on October 24, 2020, the medical group resorted to a Facebook post to warn its
patients about the disruption. One local volunteer-run fire department said ambulances were
being diverted to other hospitals; officials reported patients and staff were safe. The
downtime at the Minnesota medical facilities was no technical glitch; reports quickly linked
the activity to one of Russia’s most notorious ransomware gangs.
Thousands of miles away, just two days later members of the Trickbot cybercrime group
privately gloated over what easy targets hospitals and health care providers make. “You see,
how fast, hospitals and centers reply,” Target, a key member of the Russia-linked malware
gang, boasted in messages to one of their colleagues. The exchange is included in
previously unreported documents, seen by WIRED, that consist of hundreds of messages
sent between Trickbot members and detail the inner workings of the notorious hacking
group. “Answers from the rest, [take] days. And from the ridge immediately the answer flew
in,” Target wrote.

As Target typed, members of Trickbot were in the middle of launching a huge wave of
ransomware attacks against hospitals across the United States. Their aim: to force hospitals
busy responding to the surging Covid-19 pandemic to quickly pay ransoms. The series of
attacks prompted urgent warnings from federal agencies, including the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “Fuck clinics in the
usa this week,” Target said as they gave the instruction to start targeting a list of 428
hospitals. “There’s gonna be a panic.”
The documents seen by WIRED include messages between senior members of Trickbot,
dated from the summer and autumn of 2020, and expose how the group planned to expand
its hacking operations. They lay bare key members’ aliases and show the ruthless attitude of
members of the criminal gang.
The messages were sent in the months before and shortly after US Cyber Command
disrupted much of Trickbot’s infrastructure and temporarily stopped the group’s work. Since
then the group has scaled up its operations and evolved its malware, and it continues to
target businesses around the world. While Russia’s Federal Security Service has recently
arrested members of the REvil ransomware gang—following diplomatic efforts between
presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin—Trickbot’s inner circle has so far been left relatively
unscathed.
“They're trying to infect as many people as possible.”

The Trickbot group evolved from the banking trojan Dyre around the end of 2015, when
Dyre’s members were arrested. The gang has grown its original banking trojan to become an
all-purpose hacking toolkit; individual modules, which operate like plugins, allow its operators
to deploy Ryuk and Conti ransomware, while other functions enable keylogging and data
collection. “I don't know any other malware families that have so many modules or extended
functionalities,” says Vlad Pasca, a senior malware analyst at security company Lifars who
has decompiled Trickbot’s code. That sophistication has helped the gang, also known as
Wizard Spider, collect millions of dollars from victims.
A core team of around half a dozen criminals sits at the heart of Trickbot’s operations,
according to the documents reviewed by WIRED and security experts who track the group.
Each member has their own specialities, such as managing teams of coders or heading up
ransomware deployments. At the head of the organization is Stern. (Like all the monikers
used in this story, the real-world name, or names, behind the handles are unknown. They
are, however, the identities the group uses when talking to each other.)
“He is the boss of Trickbot,” says Alex Holden, who is CEO of cybersecurity firm Hold
Security and has knowledge of the workings of the gang. Stern acts like a CEO of the
Trickbot group and communicates with other members who are at a similar level. They may

also report to others who are unknown, Holden says. “Stern does not get into the technical
side as much,” he says. “He wants reports. He wants more communication. He wants to
make high-level decisions.”
On August 20, 2020, the chat logs—provided by a cybersecurity source with knowledge of
the group—show Target briefing Stern on how the group would expand in the coming weeks.
“There will be 6 offices for sure and 50-80 people by the end of September,” Target said in
one of a flurry of 19 messages. These offices are believed to be based in Russia’s secondlargest city, Saint Petersburg. Kimberly Goody, director of cybercrime analysis at security firm
Mandiant, says the group “most likely” has a significant presence there. Current estimates
say Trickbot has anywhere from 100 to 400 members, making it one of the largest
cybercrime groups in existence.
Messages between Target and Stern show that in mid-2020 the group was spending money
on three main areas. Two offices—“one main and one new for training”—were being used for
the current operators’ expenses and expansion. “Hacker offices,” where 20-plus people
worked, would be used for interviews, equipment, servers, and hiring, Target said. And
finally, there would be an office for “programmers” and their equipment. “A good team leader
has already been hired, and he will help gather the team,” Target continued. “I’m sure that
everything will pay off, so I’m not nervous.”
Throughout the conversations viewed by WIRED, the group makes various references to
“senior managers” working as part of Trickbot and its businesslike structure. “There is
generally a core team of developers,” Goody explains. “There's a manager who oversees
development work, and they have coders that work under them on specific projects.”
Members of the group are encouraged to propose ideas, such as new scripts or malware,
that developers could work on, Goody says, and generally the lower-level workers don’t talk
to their senior colleagues. Most of the group’s internal conversations, according to various
sources—including US court documents—happen through instant messages on Jabber
servers.
A gang member going by the moniker Professor oversees much of the ransomware
deployment work, Goody says. “Professor, who we believe also goes by the name Alter,
seems to be a relatively significant player in terms of managing these specific ransomware
deployment operations,” Goody says, “as well as requesting development of specific tools
that would help enable those.” She adds that Professor has been linked to Conti ransomware
operations in the last year and “appears to lead multiple sub-teams or has multiple team
leaders” that report to them.
That wouldn’t be the only working relationship Trickbot’s team has with outside parties. In the
conversations seen by WIRED, Target says the group will “learn to collaborate” with those
behind the Ryuk ransomware, indicating that the two organizations are largely separate. And
while the Trickbot group hasn’t been linked to hacking operations run by the Russian state—
such as the activities of Sandworm—the core members of the gang make reference to
3/6

Kremlin-backed activities. Stern mentioned setting up an office “for government topics” in
July 2020. In response, Professor said the hacking group Cozy Bear is “working their way
down the list” of potential Covid-19 targets.
In one set of internal conversations, Target answers questions from a group member who is
concerned about being caught. The person is worried that colleagues could expose their
locations, through leaking their IP addresses, when they don’t use a VPN to mask their
whereabouts. Target says IP address exposure shouldn’t be a problem: “Here it is
guaranteed that no one will touch you and you are probably not going to fly somewhere
anyway.”
Prior to the REvil arrests, the Kremlin and Russian authorities spent years allowing
ransomware groups believed to be based in the country to operate with relative impunity.
“There seems to be very deliberate separation and non-attacks of any Russian interests by
Trickbot, Ryuk, Emotet, and Conti because they don’t want confrontation with the
government,” Holden says. However, not all of Trickbot’s members are in Russia. The
conversations among the group viewed by WIRED reveal at least two members appear to be
based in Belarus—during the summer of 2020 when Belarus shut down the internet Stern
said that one member, a coder called Hof, would not be online until “the internet problem in
Belarus is solved.”
These exchanges likely comprise only a small element of the group’s interactions. Some
details of TrickBot’s inner workings were also revealed in June and October 2021, when the
US Department of Justice unsealed and unredacted charges against two alleged Trickbot
members, Alla Witte and Vladimir Dunaev. The indictment, which also covers other unnamed
members of the Trickbot group, focuses on the group’s hacking and money laundering but
also provides snippets of conversations. Goody says some private communication channels
can contain dozens of members of the group.
Coders and developers recruited by Trickbot are drawn in from job postings on dark web
forums but also on open web Russian-language freelancer websites, the DOJ indictment
says. While many of the job ads are hiding in plain sight, they don’t explicitly say successful
applicants will be working for one of the world’s most ruthless cybercriminal groups. One job
ad the indictment points to calls for someone who is an experienced reverse engineer and
knows the coding language C++. The ad, which has long-since expired, says the job was
focused around web browsers on Windows, involved working remotely, and had a budget of
$7,000. A long-term position would potentially be possible if the work was completed
successfully, the ad says.
Holden says Trickbot uses multiple layers during its hiring process in an effort to weed out
those without the technical skills needed, and also cybersecurity companies trying to gather
intelligence. Anyone applying for work has to pass an initial screening before moving on to

4/6

tough skills tests, he says. “The questions are very complex technologically,” he explains.
Goody adds that penetration testers working for the group can be paid $1,500 per month,
plus a cut of ransoms that are paid.
During the recruitment process, Holden says, it is “acknowledged” that these aren’t everyday
roles. Holden says he has seen ads that tell potential recruits they will be working for a
startup involved in bug bounties, and that most of its funding comes from abroad. “The
majority understand that this is blackhat and asking for the commercial target,” Trickbot
conversations within the DOJ indictment say, referring to criminal hacking activities. “We
need to stop communicating with idiots.”
The two alleged members of Trickbot named by the DOJ—Witte and Dunaev—were arrested
by law enforcement outside of Russia. Witte, a 55-year-old Latvian national who lived in
Suriname, was arrested in June 2021 while traveling to Miami and is charged with 19 counts
that range from identity theft to bank fraud. She’s accused of being one of Trickbot’s malware
developers and allegedly exposed herself after hosting Trickbot’s malware on her personal
domain name. Dunaev, 38, was extradited from the Republic of Korea to Ohio in October
2021 and is also accused of developing Trickbot’s malware.
Despite the arrests and wider ransomware crackdowns in Russia, the Trickbot group has not
exactly gone into hiding. Toward the end of last year, the group boosted its operations, says
Limor Kessem, an executive security advisor at IBM Security. “They're trying to infect as
many people as possible by contracting out the infection,” she says. Since the start of 2022,
the IBM security team has seen Trickbot increase its efforts to evade security protections and
conceal its activity. The FBI also formally linked the use of the Diavol ransomware to Trickbot
at the beginning of the year. “Trickbot doesn't seem to be targeting very specifically; I think
what they have is numerous affiliates working with them, and whoever brings the most
money is welcome to stay,” Limor says.
Holden too says he has seen evidence that Trickbot is ramping up its operations. “Last year
they invested more than $20 million into their infrastructure and growth of their organization,”
he explains, citing internal messages he has seen. This money, he says, is being spent on
everything Trickbot does. “Staffing, technology, communications, development, extortion” are
all getting extra investment, he says. The move points to a future where—after the takedown
of REvil—the Trickbot group may become the primary Russia-linked cybercrime gang. “You
expand in the hope of getting that money back in spades,” Holden says. “It’s not like they are
planning to close the shop. It’s not like they are planning to downsize or run and hide.”
