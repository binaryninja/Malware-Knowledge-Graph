C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations

Executive Summary
Dragos, Inc. was notified by the Slovak anti-virus firm ESET of an ICS tailored malware on June 8th, 2017. The Dragos team was able to use this notification to find
samples of the malware, identify new functionality and impact scenarios, and confirm that this was the malware employed in the December 17th, 2016 cyber-attack
on the Kiev, Ukraine transmission substation which resulted in electric grid operations impact. This report serves as an industry report to inform the electric sector
and security community of the potential implications of this malware and the appropriate details to have a nuanced discussion.

Why Are We Publishing This
Security firms must always balance a need to inform the public against empowering
adversaries with feedback on how they are being detected and analyzed. This case is
bility described in this report takes advantage of the knowledge of electric grid systems. It is not an aspect of technical vulnerability and exploitation. It cannot just be
patched or architected away although the electric grid is entirely defensible. Human
defenders leveraging an active defense such as hunting and responding internally to
the industrial control system (ICS) networks can ensure that security is maintained.

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations

Key Takeaways
•

The malware self-identifies as “crash” in multiple locations thus leading to the
naming convention “CRASHOVERRIDE” for the malware framework.

•

CRASHOVERRIDE is the first ever malware framework designed and deployed to
attack electric grids.

•

CRASHOVERRIDE is the fourth ever piece of ICS-tailored malware (STUXNET,
BLACKENERGY 2, and HAVEX were the first three) used against targets and the
second ever to be designed and deployed for disrupting physical industrial processes (STUXNET was the first).

•

CRASHOVERRIDE is not unique to any particular vendor or configuration and
instead leverages knowledge of grid operations and network communications
to cause impact; in that way, it can be immediately re-purposed in Europe and
portions of the Middle East and Asia.

•

CRASHOVERRIDE is extensible and with a small amount of tailoring such as the
can grid.

•

CRASHOVERRIDE could be leveraged at multiple sites simultaneously, but the
scenario is not cataclysmic and would result in hours, potentially a few days, of
outages, not weeks or more.

•

Dragos assesses with high confidence that the same malware was used in the
cyber-attack to de-energize a transmission substation on December 17, 2016,
resulting in outages for an unspecified number of customers.

•

The functionality in the CRASHOVERRIDE framework serves no espionage purpose and the only real feature of the malware is for attacks which would lead to
electric outages.

•

CRASHOVERRIDE could be extended to other industries with additional protocol modules, but the adversaries have not demonstrated the knowledge of
other physical industrial processes to be able to make that assessment anything
other than a hypothetical at this point and protocol changes alone would be

•

Dragos, Inc. tracks the adversary group behind CRASHOVERRIDE as ELECTRUM
and assesses with high confidence through confidential sources that ELECTRUM
has direct ties to the Sandworm team. Our intelligence ICS WorldView customers have received a comprehensive report and this industry report will not
get into sensitive technical details but instead focus on information needed for
defense and impact awareness.

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations

Background
On June 8th, 2017 the Slovak anti-virus firm ESET shared a subset of digital hashes of the malware described below and a portion of their analysis with Dragos.
The Dragos team was asked to validate ESET’s findings to news publications ESET
had contacted about the story which would be published June 12th, 2017. Dragos
would like to thank ESET for sharing the digital hashes which allowed the Dragos
team to spawn its investigation. Without control of the timeline, it was Dragos’
desire to publish a report alongside ESET’s report to capture the nuance of electric grid operations. The report also contains new discoveries, indicators, and implications of the tradecraft. Also, because of the connection to the activity group
Dragos tracks as ELECTRUM, it was our decision that an independent report was
warranted. The Dragos team has been busy over the last 96 hours reproducing and
verifying ESET’s analysis, hunting for new samples of the malware and potential additional infections, notifying appropriate companies, and informing our customers.
Importantly, Dragos also updated ICS vendors that needed to be made aware of
this capability, relevant government agencies, many national computer emergency response teams (CERTs), and key players in the electric energy community. Our
many thanks to those involved.
If you are a Dragos, Inc. customer, you will have already received the more concise
and technically in-depth intelligence report. It will be accompanied by follow-on
reports, and the Dragos team will keep you up-to-date as things evolve. It is in
Dragos’ view that the following report contains significant assessments that deserve a wide audience in the electric sector. Avoiding hype and fear should always
be paramount but this case-study is of immediate significance, and this is not a
singular contained event. The CRASHOVERRIDE capability is purpose built to impact electric grid operations and has been created as a framework to facilitate the
impact of electric grids in other countries in the future outside the attack that took
place with it December 17th, 2016 in Ukraine. However, as always, the defense is
doable.

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
Introduction to Electric Grid Operations
As with most ICS specific incidents, the most interesting components of the attack
are in how the adversary has demonstrated they understand the physical industrial process. Whereas vulnerabilities, exploits, and infection vectors can drive discussions in intrusion analysis of IT security threats that is not the most important
aspect of an ICS attack. To fully understand the CRASHOVERRIDE framework, its
individual capabilities, and overall impact on ICS security it is important to understand certain fundamentals of electric grid operations.

Simplistically, the electric grid can be categorized into three functions: generation
of electricity at power plants, transmission from the power plants across typically
long distances at high voltage, and then stepped down to lower voltage to distribution networks to power customers. Along these long transmission and distribution
systems are substations to transform voltage levels, serve as switching stations and
feeders, and fault protection.

systems and communications. As an example, while a power plant feeds energy
into the electric grid there is no one-size-fits-all approach to power plants. There
generation, wind farm, solar farm, gas turbine power, hydroelectric and more. This
means that the electric grid must be a robust, almost living creature, which moves
and balances electricity across large regions. Electric grids use a special type of
industrial control system called a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to manage this process across large geographical areas. Transmission and
distribution owners have their substations in their particular geographical footprint
and control centers manage the cross-territory SCADA systems 24/7 by human operators. These control centers often regularly manage the continual demand and
response of their customers, respond to faults, and plan and work with neighboring
utilities.
This simplistic view of grid operations is similar around the world. There are ofengineering, and the overall process is largely the same between nations. As an
example, these systems use SCADA and leverage systems such as remote terminal
units (RTUs) to control circuit breakers. As the breakers open and close, substations
are energized or de-energized to balance power across the grid. Some network
protocols such as IEC 104, a TCP-based protocol, and its serial protocol companion IEC 101, are often regional specific. Europe, some of Asian, and portions of
the Middle East leverage these protocols to control RTUs from the SCADA human
machine interfaces (HMIs).

6

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations

Figure 1: Simplistic Mockup of Electric Grid Operations Systems and Communications Relevant for CRASHOVERRIDE

In North America, the protocol of choice for this is the Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3). The various protocols purposes are largely the same though: control
physical equipment through RTUs, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and
other final control elements via HMIs as a part of the larger SCADA system. Some
protocols have been adopted cross-country including IEC 61850 which is usually leveraged from an HMI to work with equipment such as digital relays and other
types of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). IEDs are purpose built microprocessor-based control devices and can often be found alongside power equipment
such as circuit breakers. IEDs and RTUs operate in a master/slave capacity where
the slave devices are polled and sent commands by master devices.

7

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
Substations manage the flow of power through transmission or distribution lines.
Management of energizing and de-energizing of these lines ultimately control
when and where the flow of power moves in and out of the substation. If you
“open” a breaker you are removing the path where the electricity is flowing, or
de-energizing it. If you “close” a breaker then you are energizing the line by closing
the gap and allowing the power to “flow.” This concept is similar to anyone who
may be confused on this terminology as it is opposite to how one would describe

The grid is a well-designed system, and while damage can be done, it is vital to understand that in nations around the world the electric community has designed the
system to be reliable and safe which has a natural byproduct of increased security. In the United States as an example, reliability is reinforced with regular training
and events such as the North American grid’s GridEx where grid operators train for
events from hurricanes, to terrorist incidents, to cyber-attacks and how they will
respond to such outages. There is constantly a balance that must be understood
when referring to grid operations: yes, the systems are vulnerable and more must
be done to understand complex and multi-stage attacks, but the grid is also in a
great defensible position because of the work of so many over the years.

Evolution of Tradecraft
CRASHOVERRIDE represents an evolution in tradecraft and capabilities by adversaries who wish to do harm to industrial environments. To fully appreciate the
malware it is valuable to compare it to its predecessors and the Ukraine 2015 cyber
attack.

STUXNET
The STUXNET malware has been written about extensively and referenced, at
times, unfortunately, in comparison to most ICS related incidents and malware. It
was the first confirmed example of ICS tailored malware leveraged against a target. The Windows portion of the code with its four zero-day exploits gained a lot
of notoriety. However, it was the malware’s payload that was specific to ICS that
was the most interesting component. The tradecraft exhibited by STUXNET was
the detailed understanding of the industrial process. In IT networks, it is important
for adversaries to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them to load malware and gain
privileges on systems.

8

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
In ICS networks though, some of the most concerning issues are related to an
adversary’s ability to learn the physical process such as the engineering of the
systems and their components in how they work together. STUXNET’s greatest
strength was leveraging functionality in Siemens equipment to interact with nuclear enrichment centrifuges through abuses of intended functionality. The purpose
of the Siemens equipment was to be able to control and change the speed of the
centrifuges. Stuxnet did this as well but with pre-programmed knowledge from the
attackers on the speeds that would cause the centrifuge to burst from their casings. ICS tailored malware leveraging knowledge of industrial processes was now a
thing. However, it was specific to Siemens equipment and unique to the Natanz facility in Iran. While tradecraft and exploits can be replicated, it was not reasonable
to re-purpose the Stuxnet capability.

Dragonfly/HAVEX

control system locations, estimates put it at over 2,000 sites, with a large emphasis on electric power and petrochemical asset owners. The Dragonfly campaign
leveraged the HAVEX malware. There are often not many commonalities between
mentation, integration, and the physical processes required at each site. One of the
few commonalities across numerous ICS industries though is the OPC protocol.
It is designed to be the universal translator for many industrial components and is
readily accessible in an HMI or dedicated OPC server. The HAVEX malware leveraged legitimate functionality in the OPC protocol to map out the industrial equipment and devices on an ICS network. It was a clever use of the protocol and while
the malware itself was not complex the tradecraft associated with the usage of
OPC was sophisticated. However, the Dragonfly campaign was focused entirely on
espionage. There was no physical disruption or destruction of the industrial process. Instead, it was the type of data you would want to leverage to design attacks
in the future built for the specific targets impacted with the malware.

9

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
BLACKENERGY 2
The Sandworm team has targeted numerous industries ranging from western militaries, governments, research organizations, defense contractors, and industrial
sites. It was their use of the BLACKENERGY 2 malware that caught the ICS industry’s attention. This ICS tailored malware contained exploits for specific types of
HMI applications including Siemens SIMATIC, GE CIMPLICITY, and Advantech WebAccess. BLACKENERGY 2 was a smart approach by the adversaries to target internet connected HMIs. Upon exploitation of the HMIs, the adversaries had access
to a central location in the ICS to start to learn the industrial process and gain the
graphical representation of that ICS through the HMI. The targeting of HMIs alone
is often not enough to cause physical damage, but it is an ideal target for espionage and positioning in an ICS. Gaining a foothold in the network that had access
to numerous components of the ICS while maintaining command and control to
Internet locations, positioned it well for espionage.

Ukraine Cyber Attack 2015
The cyber-attack on three power companies in Ukraine on December 23rd, 2015
marked a revolutionary event for electric grid operators. It was the first known instance where a cyber-attack had disrupted electric grid operations. The Sandworm
team was attributed to the attack and their use of the BLACKENERGY 3 malware.
BLACKENERGY 3 does not contain ICS components in the way that BLACKENERGY 2 did. Instead, the adversaries leveraged the BLACKENERGY 3 malware to gain
access to the corporate networks of the power companies and then pivot into the
SCADA networks. While in the environment the adversaries performed their reconnaissance and eventually leveraged the grids systems against itself. They learned
the operations and used the legitimate functionality of distribution management
systems to disconnect substations from the grid leaving 225,000+ customers
without power for upwards of 6 hours until manual operations could restore power. However, due to the wiping of Windows systems through the KillDisk malware
and destruction of serial-to-Ethernet devices through malicious firmware updates,
the Ukrainian grid operators were without their SCADA environment, meaning they
lost the ability for automated control, for upwards of a year in some locations. The
most notable aspect of the attack was the adversary’s focus on learning how to
leverage the systems against themselves. Malware enabled the attack, and malware
aging the ICS against itself that resulted in the electric power disruptions, not malware.

10

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
CRASHOVERRIDE
The CRASHOVERRIDE malware impacted a single transmission level substation
in Ukraine on December 17th, 2016. Many elements of the attack appear to have
been more of a proof of concept than what was fully capable in the malware. The
most important thing to understand though from the evolution of tradecraft is the
codification and scalability in the malware towards what has been learned through
past attacks. The malware took an approach to understand and codify the knowledge of the industrial process to disrupt operations as STUXNET did. It leveraged
the OPC protocol to help it map the environment and select its targets similar to
HAVEX. It targeted the libraries and configuration files of HMIs to understand the
environment further and leveraged HMIs to connect to Internet-connected locations when possible as BLACKENERGY 2 had done. And it took the same type
of approach to understanding grid operations and leveraging the systems against
themselves displayed in Ukraine 2015’s attack. It did all of these things with added
sophistication in each category giving the adversaries a platform to conduct attacks against grid operations systems in various environments and not confined to
work only on specific vendor platforms. It marks an advancement in capability by
adversaries who intend to disrupt operations and poses a challenge for defenders
who look to patching systems as a primary defense, using anti-malware tools to
spot specific samples, and relying upon a strong perimeter or air-gapped network
as a silver-bullet solution. Adversaries are getting smarter, they are growing in their
ability to learn industrial processes and codify and scale that knowledge, and defenders must also adapt.

Capabilities
Capabilities Overview
The CRASHOVERRIDE malware is a modular framework consisting of an initial
backdoor, a loader module, and several supporting and payload modules.
The most important items are the backdoor, which provides access to the infected
payload modules. Dragos focused our analysis on the previously mentioned items
as they are most relevant for defending grid operations.
on the targeted industrial control system. One sample was the IEC 104 protocol
module, and the other sample was the data wiper. Both samples shared common
design characteristics indicative of being part of a broader ICS attack and manipulation framework. ESET was able to uncover an additional IEC 61850 and OPC
module which they have analyzed and shared with Dragos.
Below contains an overview of program execution flow and dependency.

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
Module Commonalities
Dragos analysts were able to determine the compile time for both modules obtained as being within 12 minutes of each other just after 2:30 am on December
18th in an unknown time zone although timestamps for both samples were zeroed
out. These times falls in the same timeframe as the Ukraine events. Both module samples exported a function named Crash that served as the main function to
begin execution. The common Crash function enables the ability to “plug and play”
additional modules.

Backdoor/RAT Module
Key Features
•

Authenticates with a local proxy via the internal network established before the
backdoor installation

•

After authentication opens HTTP channel to external command and control
server (C2) through internal proxy

•

Receives commands via the external command and control (C2) server

•

Creates a file on the local system (contents not determined)

•

Overwrites an existing service to point to the backdoor so the malware persists
between reboots

Details
Access to the ICS network flows through a backdoor module. Dragos obtained
four samples which all featured similar functionality. On execution, the malware
attempts to contact a hard-coded proxy address located within the local network.
ELECTRUM must establish the internal proxy before the installation of the backdoor.
The malware expects to communicate to an internal proxy listening on TCP 3128.
This port is a default port associated with the Squid proxy. The beaconing continues without pause until it establishes a connection. The backdoor then sends a series of HTTP POST requests with the victim’s Windows GUID (a unique identifier set
with every Windows installation) in the HTTP body. This information authenticates
the targeted machine to the command and control (C2) server. If the C2 server
does not respond, the backdoor will exit.

13

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
If the authentication is successful to the internal proxy, the malware attempts to perform an HTTP CONNECT to an external C2 server via the internal proxy. Across four
December 2016 attack on Ukraine:
195.16.88.6

93.115.27.57
5.39.218.152
A check of the TOR project’s ExoneraTOR service indicates that all of the listed IP addresses were listed as active TOR nodes during the events in Ukraine.
When performing the HTTP CONNECT, the malware attempts to identify the system
default user agent. If this cannot be determined or does not exist, then a hard-coded
default for the malware is used:
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.1)
The malware can be configured to beacon out periodically afterwards via a hard-coded
configuration value. The implant is designed to retrieve commands from the C2 server:
•

Create a new process as logged in user

•

Create a new process as specified user via CreateProcessWithLogon

•

Write a file

•

Copy a file

•

Execute a command as logged in user

•

Execute a command as specified user

•

Kill the backdoor

•

Stop a service

•

Specify a user (log in as user) and stop a service

•

Specify a user (log in as user) and start a service

•

Alter an existing service to point to specified process and change to start at boot

Execution results in several artifacts left on the host. During execution, the malware
checks for the presence of a mutex value. Mutexes are program objects that name resources to enable sharing with multiple program threads. In this case, CRASHOVERRIDE
checks the following:
\Sessions\1\Windows\ApiPortection
14

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
The backdoor may also create and check a blank mutex name. Reviewing memory during execution and analysis of other modules in the malware indicates that \
Sessions\1\Windows\ appears multiple times, indicating that a check may be performed.
The backdoor writes a file to either C:\Users\Public\ or C:\Users\<Executing User>
The contents of this file were not discovered during our analysis, and it did not
appear to be vital to the malware functionality. However, this is a good indicator of
the observed activity and may be leveraged to detect this specific sample through
host-based indicator checking.
The service manipulation process is the only persistence mechanism for the malware. When used, the adversary can select an arbitrary system service, direct it to
refer to CRASHOVERRIDE, and ensure it is loaded on system boot. If this fails, the
malware, although present on disk, will not start when the machine reboots.
When evaluating the options provided to the adversary, an important piece of
functionality associated with most remote access tools is absent: a command to
exfiltrate data. While this functionality could be created via the command execution options, one would expect this option to be explicit given options to download and copy files on the host if the adversary intended to use the tool as an
all-encompassing backdoor and espionage framework. Instead, the functionality
of this tool is explicitly designed for facilitating access to the machine and executing commands on the system and cannot reasonably be confused as an espionage
platform, data stealer, or another such item.

Launcher Module
Key Features
•

Loads payload modules which manipulate the ICS and cause destruction via
the wiper

•

Starts itself as a service likely to hide better

•

Loads the payload module(s) defined on the command line during execution

•

Launches the payload and begins either 1 or 2 hours countdown before
launching the data wiper (variant dependent)

15

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
Details
Within the attack sequence, the ICS payload modules and data wiper module must be
loaded by a separate loader EXE. Dragos obtained one sample of this file called the
Launcher.
The launcher takes three parameters on start:

On launch, the sample analyzed starts a service named defragsvc. It then loads the
module DLL via an exported function named Crash. A new thread is created at the
highest priority on the executing machine. Control then passes from the launcher to
the loaded module while the launcher waits two hours before executing the data wiper.

Data Wiper Module
Key Features
•

Clears all registry keys associated with system services

•

Overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files in this sample

•

Overwrites generic Windows files

•

Renders the system unusable

Details
Once executed, the data wiper module clears registry keys, erase files, and kill processes running on the system. A unique characteristic of the wiper is that the main
functionality was implemented within the Crash function.
The first task of the wiper writes zeros into all of the registry keys in:
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
This registry tree contains initialization values for each service on the system. Removal
of these values renders a system inoperable. The next wiper task targets ICS configuration files across the local hard drive and mapped network drives. The malware authors included functionality to target drives lettered C-Z.
16

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
The wiper also targets file types unique to ABB’s PCM600 product used in substation automation in addition to more general Windows files. The below table outlines some of the unique file extensions used by industrial control systems.

Key Features
•

Reads a configuration file defining the target (likely an RTU) and action to
take

•

•

Masquerades as the new master

•

Enters one of four modes:

Figure 4: Execution Flow of IEC 104 Module in CRASHOVERRIDE

Details
The CRASHOVERRIDE IEC 104 module is a complete implementation of IEC 104 to
serve in a “MASTER” role. This raw functionality creates a Swiss army knife for substation automation manipulation yet also provides tailored functionality. The functions exposed to the malware operator are confined by the options of the configuration file. This report outlines the options analyzed today but notes that extending
and enhancing functionality is straight forward with the robust protocol implementation.

ifications for the device must be provided by the operator in the configuration file
for the module to function. There are no observed automated means of enumerating the network and then impacting RTUs.

Once the IEC 104 master thread begins, the first action is to try to kill the communications service process which acts as the master process. Once the module stops
the communications service process, a socket opens with the target IP and destination port sending data to slave devices and receiving the resulting responses.

20

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
Depending on the mode defined within the configuration file the module may:
•

Set specific values

•

Enumerate IOAs on the target devices

•

Continuously set the IOA to open, or

•

Continuously toggle the IOA between open and closed states.

This module contains no interactive capability.
RTUs and PLCs, in simplistic terms, act on input and output. Each discrete input
and output is tied to a memory address. Depending on implementation these addresses are referred to as coils, registers, or for IEC 104: information object ador Unsigned Integer values. The 104 module properly understands how to enumerate and discover IOAs to operate breakers.

IEC 101 Module
This module was unavailable to Dragos at the time of publication. ESET’s analysis
claims the functionality is equivalent to the IEC 104 module except with communications over serial. However, Dragos was able to confirm that the module exists.

IEC 61850 Module
This module was unavailable to Dragos at the time of publication. ESET’s analysis
claims once executed the module leverages a configuration file to identify targets
and without a configuration file it enumerates the local network to identify potential targets. It communicates with the targets to identify whether the device controls a circuit breaker switch. For certain variables (no further information available) it will change their state while also generating an action log. However, Dragos
was able to confirm that this module does exist.

OPC DA Module
This module was unavailable to Dragos at the time of publication. ESET’s analysis
claims the module does not require a configuration. It enumerates all OPC servers
and their associated items looking for a subset related to ABB containing the string
ctl. It then writes 0x01 twice into the item overwriting the proper value giving the
device a primary value out of limits device status. However, Dragos was able to
confirm that this module exists.

21

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
SIPROTEC DoS Module
This module was unavailable to Dragos at the time of publication. ESET’s analysis
claims the module sends UDP packets to port 50000 exploiting CVE-2015-5374
causing the SIPROTEC digital relay to fall into an unresponsive state. Dragos could
not validate that this module exists.

Capability Conclusions
ELECTRUM’s ability to adopt a development style described above has several implications: first, developers can integrate new protocols into the overall framework
quickly. Second, ELECTRUM could easily leverage external development teams
skilled at exploiting industrial control systems. Some adversaries would likely approach capability development through a ‘two-tier’ approach: a core development
team skilled at writing the overall framework and a second team knowledgeable
about a given control system. The platform team would take the control system modules and add logic to fit them within the platform. The IEC 104 module
demonstrates this approach.
Given the execution described with secondary threads the team authoring the
Crash function likely did not author the IEC 104 master portion of the code. Both
development teams probably worked together to decide on a log file format for
consumption by the main Crash function and executed in each of the IEC 104
module threads.

Implications of capability
This section describes legitimate CRASHOVERRIDE attack and impact scenarios.
Extensions of these and potential hypothetical scenarios were deemed indeterministic and will not be addressed.

Attack Option: De-energize substation
CRASHOVERRIDE, based on prior knowledge, must have a configuration file for
targeting information of one or multiple RTUs. This configuration option allows for
several types of activities. One operation the configuration option allows is ‘sequence.’

.

immediate impact while in others it could put customers into an outage. It is important to note that grid operations encompass failure modes and operations can
normally compensate. That is, after all, why humans are ‘in the loop’ to monitor

breakers and will be required to send crews to the substation. If the CRASHOVERRIDE loop continues unabated, then the crews will likely sever communications as
both a troubleshooting and recovery action. Severing communications puts the
substation in manual operation where a physical presence is now required. This
could result in a few hours of outages

Attack Option: Force an Islanding event
Dragos is currently investigating a separate and more disruptive attack option in
CRASHOVERRIDE as described by ESET. As before, the attacker must have a configuration file for targeting information of one or multiple RTUs. This configuration file
now uses the range command to begin a loop that toggles the status of the breaker between open and close continuously. The changing breaker status will invoke
automated protective operations to isolate (commonly referred to as ‘islanding’)
the substation. This is an intentional self-protective capability of grid operations.

relay scheme’s automated operations causing perturbations of some degree on the
grid as scientific principles define how the behavior interacts with frequencies and
ations. Grid operation contingencies become more critical if multiple substations
were under attack likely resulting in many small islanding events. This is assuming
coordinated targeting of multiple electric sites and could result in a few days of
outages.

Adding Amplification Attacks
Forcing an islanding of a substation through continual breaker manipulation is significant by itself. However, CRASHOVERRIDE has the potential to amplify this attack

Variable Out of Limits” misdirecting operators from understanding protective relay
status.

Deﬁnition
More Status Available – More status information is available via
Command 48, Read Additional Status Information.
Loop Current Fixed – The Loop Current is being held at a fixed
value and is not responding to process variations.
Loop Current Saturated – The Loop Current has reached its
upper (or lower) endpoint limit and cannot increase (or decrease)
any further.
Non-Primary Variable Out of Limits – A Device variable not
mapped to the PV is beyond its operating limits.
Primary Variable Out of Limits – The PV is beyond its operating
limits.

The outcome of the action infers that various systems can either perform actions
on wrong information or report incorrect information to system operators. This
Denial of Visibility will amplify misunderstanding and confusion while system operators troubleshoot the problem as their system view will show breakers closed
when they are open.

Using CVE-2015-5374 to Hamper Protective Relays
A second, and more severe, amplifying attack would be to neutralize the automated protective system by creating a Denial of Service against some or all of the
protective relays. This possibility exists in a tool ESET has claimed to have discovered that implements the known CVE-2015-5374 Denial of Service condition to the
Siemens SIPROTEC relays. Siemens released a patch for this in July 2015 under Siemens advisory SCA-732541. At this time it is believed that CVE-2015-5374 causes a
denial of service (DoS) of the complete relay functionality and not just the network
communications module. Dragos has independent evidence that this module exists but it cannot be confirmed.
Hampering the protective scheme by disabling the protective relays can broaden
the islanding event and, if done at scale, could trigger a larger event causing multiple substations and lines “islanding” from the electric grid. Siemens SIPROTEC was
likely chosen in this attack only because that was the vendor device at the Ukraine
Kiev site attacked in December 2016. This same tactic against digital relays, albeit not the same exploit, could have a similar impact on grid operations. However,

Defense Recommendations
Doing the basics is always appropriate, and it significantly helps move ICS into a
defensible position. However, they are not worth repeating here, and instead, more
tailored approaches specific to ICS security analysts trying to defend against CRASHOVERRIDE and similar capabilities are presented below:
•

Electric utility security teams should have a clear understanding of where
and how IEC 104 and IEC 61850 protocols are used. North American electric utilities should include DNP3 on this list in case the malware is extended
to impact U.S. systems. Look specifically for increased usage of the protocols against baselines established in the environment. Also, look for systems
leveraging these protocols if they have not before and specifically try to
identify systems that are generating new network flows using these protocols.

•

Similarly, understand OPC implementations and identify how the protocol is
being used. It is a protocol that is pervasive across numerous sectors. Also,
CRASHOVERRIDE is the second, out of four, ICS tailored malware suite with
OPC capabilities. OPC will appear abnormal in the CRASHOVERRIDE usage
as it is being used to scan all devices on the network which would generate

•

Robust backups of engineering files such as project logic, IED configurahelp reduce the impact of the wiper functionality.

•

Prepare incident response plans for this attack and perform table top exercises bringing in appropriate stakeholders and personnel across engineering, operations, IT, and security. The scenario should include substation
outages with the requirement to do manual operations while recovering the
SCADA environment and gathering appropriate forensics.

•

The included YARA rules and other indicators of compromise can be leveraged to search for possible infections (IOCs). The YARA rules will provide a
higher confidence towards discovering an infection than the other IOCs and
should be searched for against Windows OT systems especially noting HMIs.
The behavioral analytics to identify the communications on the network
would provide the highest capability to detect this and similar threats.

C R A S H OV E R R I D E : Threat to the Electric Grid Operations
While some defenses and architecture changes may have value in other situations,
the following are responses that are not appropriate for this attack:
•

Transmission and distribution companies should not rely on the usage of
other protocols such as DNP3 as a protection mechanism. The completeness of the CRASHOVERRIDE framework suggests there may be other undisclosed modules such as a DNP3 module. Also, adding this functionality
into the existing framework would not require extensive work on the part of
the adversary.

•

Air gapped networks, unidirectional firewalls, anti-virus in the ICS, and other
passive defenses and architecture changes are not appropriate solutions for
this attack. No amount of security control will protect against a determined
human adversary. Human defenders are required
