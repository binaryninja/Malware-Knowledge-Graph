[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

Abstract
Red Eyes attack group has also been tracked as Geumseong121, Group 123, ScarCruft, APT37, Reaper,
and Ricochet Chollima. Based on the contents of malicious files used in the attacks, it appears that its
main targets are organizations and individuals whose work involves North Korea. These include North
Korean defectors, human rights activists for North Korea, North Korean researchers, and journalists. In
some cases, it has even accessed South Korean military related documents.

Red Eyes group’s main method is to send a document via email or mobile messenger to deliver the
malware. Typically, executable files in formats such as .vbs or .exe are inserted in documents. The
group also exploits the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) vulnerability of the Hangul word-processing
program, which is widely used throughout South Korea.

Microsoft Office documents have also been used in attacks. In October 2017, the group launched an
attack that exploited Microsoft Word’s Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) feature. In February 2018, Red
Eyes exploited the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). 1 It was later
revealed, however, that the first such attack had taken place in November 2017. Then, in March
2018, Red Eyes launched a targeted mobile malware attack.2

The activities of Red Eyes were first detected in the fall of 2016, not long after the disappearance of
an earlier group of hackers that were active from 2015 to the spring of 2016. That earlier group
carried out Operation ProgamsByMe in 2015 and is thought to be affiliated with Red Eyes. Red Eyes
use a variety of methods and is known to include text strings within their code such as “First,”
“Happy,” and “Work.”

In this report, we will take a closer look at the main activities of Red Eyes and another group that
may be affiliated with it.

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

Overview of the Activities of Red Eyes
Hacking attempts have targeted North Korean defectors and human rights activists for North Korea over
the course of five years. In one case, a website operated by North Korean defectors was attacked. An
investigation carried out by major domestic and overseas security vendors revealed that some of the
attacks were the work of a group called Red Eyes.

Red Eyes attack group is also known as Geumseong121, Group 123, ScarCruft, APT37, Reaper, and
Ricochet Chollima. Based on the contents of malicious files used in the attacks, it appears that its main
targets are organizations and individuals whose work involves North Korea. These include North Korean
defectors, human rights activists for North Korea, North Korean researchers, and journalists. In some
cases, it has even accessed Korean military related documents.

The information about the group was first reported by Cisco Talos, a threat intelligence team, in
2017,3 but Red Eyes received more attention at the end of January 2018, when it launched an attack
that exploited the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). 4 Soon after,
cybersecurity companies released their findings: FireEye released its analysis of the group in
February,5 and in March, ESTsecurity announced its findings on mobile malware that had been
distributed through a mobile messenger.

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

1. Current Status and Characteristics
Malware with Red Eyes characteristics were discovered repeatedly beginning in the fall of 2016
through the end of 2017. The occurrence of the malware is shown in Figure 1. Most of the malware
took the form of document files, droppers, or backdoors.

[Figure 1] Occurrence of Malware from Red Eyes Group (Sept. 2016-Feb. 2018)

One of the characteristics of malware from this group is that it uses a program database (PDB) text
string. Table 1 shows the PDB text strings that were used to gain information about the malware,
such as its version and type.

2. Main Attacks and Methods
Red Eyes spreads malware mainly by sending malicious email attachments to their targets. In March
2018, it also used mobile messenger texts to send malware.

They mainly exploit the EPS vulnerability of the Hangul (.hwp) word-processing program, which is
widely used in South Korea, or used the method of inserting executable files, such as .vbs or .exe.
They also use Microsoft Office documents for attacks. In October 2017, the group launched an attack
that exploited Microsoft Word’s DDE feature. Then, in February 2018, it used a Microsoft Office file
to exploit the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). This method of attack was
later identified to have first taken place in November 2017.

Red Eyes group has been active since 2016. Its main attacks are listed in [Table 2].

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

The group first exploited the EPS vulnerability of the Hangul word program in the fall of 2016. The
malicious documents concerned academic conferences and news about North Korea and matters
relating to North Korean defectors.

In January 2017, a Hangul file containing the new year address of North Korea was used in an email
attachment attack that used the file as loader for in-memory execution of another malware.
A variant of this malware was found in November 2016.

[Figure 2] Occurrence of Malware from Red Eyes Group (Sept. 2016-Feb. 2018)

In February 2017, a DogCall backdoor was found in a Hangul file disguised as a résumé. The DDEbased attacks took place in late October and November 2017.

In November 2017, Red Eyes used an attack method where a .vbs file was linked in the body of a
Hangul file concerning a civic organization for human rights in North Korea. (md5:
7ca1e08fc07166a440576d1af0a15bb1). If the user clicks on the text, an HncModuleUpdate.vbs file
is executed to perform malicious tasks.

At the end of January 2018, the Korea National Computer Emergency Response Team (krCERT) within
the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) announced that it had discovered the Adobe Flash Player
zero-day vulnerability. In fact, however, a similar attack had occurred in November 2017 using a
document on cosmetics prices.

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

The malicious Hangul document (md5: 44bdeb6c0af7c36a08c64e31ceadc63c) discovered in January
2017, masquerading as the New Year address of North Korea, had an executable file inserted. Malware
is executed if the user clicks on the file.

When an object is inserted in a Hangul file, it is possible to check the original file path as shown in Figure
3. This information can provide clues as to who may have developed the malware.

[Figure 3] Path of the Attachment Used in the Hangul Document

C:\Users\pad-2\AppData\Local\Temp\Hwp (3).exe
\\192.168.100.22\saggazi\Happy\Work\2016.8~\2016.8.10~\(University in Korea)\(Korean
name)2016.8.24\2017.1.1mail\Hwp.exe
[Table 3] Path of an Inserted Document

As shown in Figure 3, the original file was attached from a path where the username of the system was
“pad-2” and the mapped network folder was called "saggazi." The path also included the name of a
university in South Korea and a name in Korean characters. Based on the presence of Korean characters
and “saggazi,” a transliteration of a Korean word, it can be assumed that the malware creator is Korean
or someone who is familiar with the language.

Detailed Analysis of Malware
The malware distributed by Red Eyes group can be divided into four main types as shown in Table 4.
Category

Description

Reloader (DocPrint)

Loader that executes another malware in-memory

Reloaderx

Collects system information and downloads additional files

Redoor (DogCall)

Uses backdoor function

Wiper

Destroys data on the hard disk
[Table 4] Main Malware of Red Eyes Group

1. Reloader (DocPrint)
The Reloader (DocPrint) executes another malware in-memory using a wscript.exe file. The actual
malware is encrypted and a similar decryption code is found in its variants.

[Figure 4] Main Decryption Code

2. Reloaderx
Reloaderx (md5: 6Cec7de9d4797895775e2add9d6855ba) is executed in-memory by DocPrint (md5:
0ff0f3f0722dd122a0f5c3d4c7752675, fc0a9850f7b6a91f7757d64c86cfc141), which was inserted in the
Hangul file disguised as the 2017 New Year address of North Korea.

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

Reloaderx collects the following system information and downloads additional malware:
Computer name
User name
Execution path
BIOS model

Variants of Reloaderx were also discovered in November 2016, and they shared the same C&C server
addresses as follows:
MD5

C&C Server Address

www.belasting-telefoon.nl/images/banners/temp/index.php

[Table 5] Reloaderx Malware and Its C&C Server Address

3. Redoor (DogCall)
Redoor, also known as DogCall or ROKRAT, was first discovered in February 2017. Redoor is the malware
executed by Reloader that acts as a loader. Until January 2017, Reloader executed Reloaderx, but in
February of that year it began executing Redoor. It is a commonly used backdoor, and was used as
recently as March 2018.

4. Wiper
One kind of malware used by Red Eyes group destroys all data on the hard disk when executed. After
destroying the data and rebooting the system, it would display the message “Are you Happy?” as shown
in Figure 5.

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

Possible Association with Other Attack Groups
In the aforementioned cases involving the Hangul document, we saw that the malware creator’s system
username was “pad-2” and that the file path included text strings such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work.”
This suggests an association between the Hangul attacks and other attacks that have occurred since 2015.

[Figure 6] Overview of Similarities between Attacks, 2015–2018

Operation ProgamsByMe (2015)
Operation ProgamsByMe started in July 2015 and continued until April 2016. The characteristic of this
malware is that it contained the text string “ProgamsByMe,” which could reflect either a typographical
error or an intentional misspelling of “Programs.”

The attack group that carried out this attack sent email to the targets, either exploiting the vulnerabilities
of Hangul or disguising the malware as an update for another popular program. In one case, malware
was distributed via a specific Active-X installation file.

This group of hackers attempted to attack an ICT company in May 2015 by disguising malware as a
security update (malware removal and patch update) for the Hancom Office suite, which includes Hangul
(md5 : 89c3254aa577d3788f0f402fe6e5a855).

[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group

In January 2016, this group distributed malware (md5: 06ae5d62d56f21cd2676989743b9626c)
purporting to discuss countermeasures to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, “Truth and
countermeasures on North Korea's hydrogen bomb game.hwp”. In February 2016, it used malware (md5:
d00e3196bc847e63fc4b255e8ab06d1c) disguised as a piracy investigation program of the Korean
National Police Agency (md5: f793deeee9dc4235d228e68d27057dcc). In March 2016, the group
attacked a media organization and additionally installed keyloggers.

[Table 7] Main Malware from the Group behind Operation ProgamsByMe

The group also used tools such as keylogging, recording, and screen capture tools in the attack to monitor
attack targets.

In addition, the code had some interesting features.

■ Awkward Korean messages
The dropper that was created and widely distributed in August 2015 included CppUACSelfElevation.pdb
in its PDB.

This dropper (md5: 9ac2ffd3f1cea2e01ed77c2e7b4a29e7) displays an error message which is closer to
North Korean language usage, which sounds awkward to South Koreans.

■ Tools believed to have been used by the attacker
There are also programs that seem to be tools internally used by the attacker. The attacker used these
tools to add malware to the Hangul file (md5: 2f0492f53d348bea993b7ae5983508a6).

This tool included the following PDB.
D:\TASK\ProgamsByMe(2015.1~)\ShellCode\Debug\HwpConvert.pdb

The attacker also seems to have used a management program (md5: 5ef03b48b4ae68c572028c7257
2444d2).

Another management program used by the attacker (md5: 49d30adaab769fbea2ef69e09c6598c5) is
called Manager of Zombies Version 1.0. In the program information, the malware creators refer to
themselves as the “Team,” as shown in Figure 10.

[Figure 10] The Management Program Used by the Attacker

Malware Created by the User “Pad-1” (2016)
As mentioned before, the document distributed in 2017 disguised as the New Year address of North
Korea (md5: 44bdeb6c0af7c36a08c64e31ceadc63c) came from a person whose system username was
“pad-2.” However, malware designed from the system where the username was “pad-1” was discovered
from December 2016 to January 2017. This malware included the following PDB: C:\Users\pad1\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\ConsoleApplication9\Release\ConsoleApplication9.pdb.

December 2016 from the address http://www.i***.com/admin/data/bbs/review2/im/jquery_min_1.5.1.js.
This web address (i ***.com) is identical to the address used in Red Eyes attacks that took place in
January and March 2017.

AhnLab’s Response
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and remediates malware of the Red Eyes group under the
following aliases:
- Trojan/Win32.Agent (2017.02.07.00)
- Trojan/Win32.Backdoor (2015.08.01.00)
- Trojan/Win32.Reloaderx (2016.11.06.00)

Conclusion
The Red Eyes group appeared in the fall of 2016 and is now drawing significant attention. The group uses
a variety of methods but can be identified by a code that includes text strings such as “First,” “Happy,”
and “Work.” Red Eyes may very well be behind Operation ProgamsByMe, which took place in 2015; it is
likely that they are at least associated with it either directly or indirectly. Red Eyes appeared right after
the disappearance of a group that was active in 2015 through to the spring of 2016.

This suggests that the activities of Red Eyes in South Korea date back to 2015, and possibly even earlier.
Because the hackers seem to have used the same source code but different compilation paths for the
malware, we can conclude that there is more than one attacker involved.

Currently, the Red Eyes group is targeting other countries in addition to South Korea. There is a clear
need to continue monitoring its movements.
