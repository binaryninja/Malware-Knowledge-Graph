7 November 2018 / Botnet
This article was co-authored by Hui Wang and RootKiter.
Since September 2018, 360Netlab Scanmon has detected multiple scan spikes on TCP port
5431, each time the system logged more than 100k scan sources, a pretty large number
compared with most other botnets we have covered before.
The interaction between the botnet and the potential target takes multiple steps, it starts with
tcp port 5431 destination scan, then moving on to check targetâ€™s UDP port 1900 and
wait for the target to send the proper vulnerable URL. After getting the proper URL, it takes
another 4 packet exchanges for the attacker to figure out where the shellcode's execution
start address in memory is so a right exploit payload can be crafted and fed to the target.
At the beginning we were not able to capture a valid sample as the honeypot needs to be
able to simulate the above scenarios. We had to tweak and customize our honeypot quite a
few times, then finally in Oct, we got it right and successfully tricked the botnet to send us the
sample (we call it BCMUPnP_Hunter).
The botnet has the following characteristics:
The amount of infection is very large, the number of active scanning IP in each scan
event is about 100,000;
The target of infection is mainly router equipment with BroadCom UPnP feature
enabled.
Self-built proxy network (tcp-proxy), the proxy network is implemented by the attacker,
the proxy currently communicates with well-known mail servers such as Outlook,
Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, etc. We highly suspect that the attacker's intention is to send
spams.

Scale Assessment

1/11

The trend of scanning source IP for TCP port 5431 in the last 30 days is as follows:

It can be seen that the scan activity picks up every 1-3 days. The number of active
scanning IP in each single event is about 100,000
All together we have 3.37 million unique scan source IPs. It is a big number, but it is
likely that the IPs of the same infected devices just changed over time.
The number of potential infections may reach 400,000 according to Shodan based on
the search of banner: Server: Custom/1.0 UPnP/1.0 Proc/Ver

Geographical distribution for the scanner IPs in the last 7 days (click to enlarge, deeper
means more infected devices).

Infected Device Information
We probed the scanners, and 116 different type of infected device information is obtained,
the actual infected device type should be more than what displays below:

Botnet Workflow
As mentioned in the beginning, the bot has to go through multiple steps to infect a
protentional target, see the following diagram for the workflow, note the Loader is (
109.248.9.17:4369 )

Figure 1: BCMUPnP_Hunter Infection process (Click to enlarge)

The Sample
The sample of the botnet consists of two parts, the shellcode and the Main sample, which
are described below.

shellcode
6/11

The main function of shellcode is to download the main sample from
C2( 109.248.9.17:8738 ) and execute it.
The shellcode has a full length of 432 bytes, very neatly organized and written, some proofs
below (We did not find similar code using search engines). It seems that the author has
profound skills and is not a typical script kid:
Code basic: The code has multiple syscall calls for networks, processes, files, etc.
Some details: syscall 0x40404 (instead of syscall 0 ) and multiple inversion
operations were used so bad characters ( \x00 ) could be avoided; the stack variables
in the code also have different degrees of multiplexing to optimize the runtime stack
structure;
Code logic: by calling the Loop at various section, the possibility of many failed calls is
reasonably avoided, and the validity of shellcode execution is guaranteed.
The complete flow chart is as follows:

Figure 2: Shellcode calling graph(Click to enlarge)

Main Sample
The main sample includes BroadCom UPnP vulnerability probe and a proxy access network
module, it can parse four instruction codes from C2:
Command Code
0x00000000
0x01010101
0x02020202
0x03030303

|

Length
0x18
0x4c
0x08
0x108

|

Function
The first packet, no practical function
Search for potential vulnerable target
Empty current task
Access Proxy Network
8/11

0x01010101 to enable the port scan task, once the BOT IDs a potential target, the

target IP will be reported to the Loader, and then the Loader will complete the
subsequent infection process.
0x03030303 is for the proxy service, BOT accesses the address provided in the
instruction and reports the access result to the C2. This can generate real economic
benefits. Attackers can use this command to build a proxy network, and then profit from
doing things such as sending spam, simulating clicks, and so on.

Proxy Network and Spam
In the instructions we have obtained, BCMUPnP_Hunter is used to proxy traffic to the
following servers:
104.47.0.33:25
104.47.12.33:25
104.47.124.33:25
104.47.14.33:25
104.47.33.33:25
104.47.48.33:25
104.47.50.33:25
106.10.248.84:25
144.160.159.21:25
188.125.73.87:25
67.195.229.59:25
74.6.137.63:25
74.6.137.64:25
98.137.159.28:25

This table shows what we have dug out from our various data sources for the above IPs:

As can be seen:
9/11

These servers are all well-known mail service providers, including Outlook, Hotmail,
Yahoo! Mail;
For several months, these servers have provided and only provided TCP25 services;
In this case, it appears that the attacker is abusing the email service of these servers;
This makes us highly skeptical that the attacker is using the proxy network established by
BCMUPnP_Hunter to send spam.

Appendix: About the BroadCom UPnP Vulnerability
UPnP is the acronym for Universal Plug and play, the Universal plug-in protocol. [1] The goal
of the agreement is to enable home networks (data sharing, communication and
entertainment) and various devices in the corporate network to seamlessly connect with
each other and simplify the implementation of related networks. Broadcom UPnP is a
concrete implementation of Broadcom's response to the UPnP protocol.
As Broadcom is in the industry upstream of the supply chain, the implementation is adopted
by major router manufacturers, including Asus, D-link,zyxel,us Robotics,t p-link,netgear and
so on.
In October 2013, security researchers at security research firm DefenseCode discovered the
BroadCom UPnP format string vulnerability in the protocol stack . Considering that the
vulnerability affects products from several major router vendors, DefenseCode did not
disclose their findings until 2017. The code disclosed this time is of a verification nature[2] An
attacker must complete the necessary vulnerability analysis and optimize the shellcode
process on the basis of a publicly available document before it can be of practical power.
