Iran­based attackers use back door threats to spy on Middle
Eastern targets
Two Iran­based attack groups that appear to be connected, Cadelle and
Chafer, have been using Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi to
spy on Iranian individuals and Middle Eastern organizations.

Two teams of Iran­based attackers have been using back door threats to conduct targeted
surveillance of domestic and international targets. While the groups are heavily targeting
individuals located in Iran, they’ve also compromised airlines and telecom providers in the Middle
East region, possibly in an attempt to monitor targets’ movements and communications.
The attackers are part of two separate groups that have a shared interest in targets. One group,
which we call Cadelle, uses Backdoor.Cadelspy
(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015­090808­1754­99), while
the other, which we’ve named Chafer, uses Backdoor.Remexi
(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015­110911­3433­99) and
Backdoor.Remexi.B (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015­
110911­4128­99). These threats are capable of opening a back door and stealing information
from victims’ computers
The Cadelle and Chafer groups
Symantec telemetry identified Cadelle and Chafer activity dating from as far back as July 2014,
however, it’s likely that activity began well before this date. Command­and­control (C&C)
registrant information points to activity possibly as early as 2011, while executable compilation
times suggest early 2012. Their attacks continue to the present day. Symantec estimates that
each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people.
The back door threats that the groups use appear to be custom made. It’s unclear how Cadelle
infects its targets with Backdoor.Cadelspy. However, Chafer has been observed compromising
web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks, to drop Backdoor.Remexi onto victims’

computers. Chafer then uses Remexi to gather user names and passwords to help it spread
further across the network.
There is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way, though we
cannot confirm this. A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy and Remexi infections
within a small time window. In one instance, a computer was compromised with
Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with Backdoor.Remexi. The Cadelle and
Chafer groups also keep the same working hours and focus on similar targets. However, no
sharing of C&C infrastructure between the teams has been observed.
If Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working for a single
entity. Their victim profile may be of interest to a nation state.
The victims
Data from Cadelle’s C&C servers shows that a large number of Backdoor.Cadelspy infections
affected individual users of Iranian internet service providers (ISPs) and hosting services. This
suggests that the majority of victims are based in Iran. There was also a significant amount of
individual targets that used anonymous proxy services to go online. Reports have shown that
many Iranians avail of these services to access sites that are blocked by the government’s
internet censorship measures (http://www.cnet.com/news/iranians­find­ways­to­bypass­net­
censors/). Dissidents, activists, and researchers in the region may use these proxies in an
attempt to keep their online activities private.

In terms of targeted organizations, both Cadelle and Chafer seem to be interested in a similar
category of organizations, such as airlines and telecom companies. The affected organizations
we were able to identify are mostly based in the Middle East region in countries such as Saudi
Arabia and Afghanistan, while one organization is located in the US.

Figure 2. Number of unique organizations hit with Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi from
July 2014 to October 2015
Our telemetry shows that among more than a dozen entities that experienced Cadelspy and
Remexi infections, four of them were compromised with both of the threats at some stages. In
most instances, victim computers were infected with either Backdoor.Cadelspy or
Backdoor.Remexi, not both. Less than five percent of computers were infected with both malware
families. In one affected organization, there was intermittent activity between the threats over ten
months. A combined total of 60 computers were compromised in another organization for almost
a year.
The malware’s activity on victim computers appears to depend on the targets. One computer that
was infected with both Cadelspy and Remexi was a system that ran a SIM card editing
application. Other compromised computers included those belonging to web developers, or are
file and database servers.
The nature of the victims suggests that Cadelle and Chafer are primarily interested in tracking
individuals in terms of their movements and communications. Compromising regional telcos and
airlines can help the attackers achieve this aim.
Based in Iran?
There are a number of factors in these groups’ campaigns that suggests that the attackers may
be based in Iran. Cadelle and Chafer are most active during the day time within Iran’s time zone

and primarily operate during Iran’s business week (Saturday through Thursday).

Figure 3. Cadelle and Chafer’s activity levels by hour in Iran’s time zone (UTC +3.5)
Additionally, Symantec observed that Backdoor.Cadelspy’s file strings seem to include dates
written in the Solar Hijri (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar) calendar, which is
used in Iran and Afghanistan. While the Gregorian calendar marks the current year as 2015, the
Solar Hijri calendar states that it is 1394. When we converted the dates in the file strings from the
Solar Hijri calendar to the Gregorian one, we found that they were close to the compilation times
of the executables and also close to when Cadelle’s targets were initially compromised.
Based on our analysis, we believe that Cadelle and Chafer’s victims are most likely to be of
interest to an Iranian entity. Cadelle and Chafer are by no means the first Iran­based attack group
to appear. Other groups attributed to Iranian attackers, such as Rocket Kitten, have targeted
Iranian individuals in the past, including anonymous proxy users, researchers, journalists, and
dissidents. Backdoor.Remexi activity in particular is reminiscent of Operation Cleaver, as
documented by Cylance
(http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/270968/assets/Cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf),
and may possibly be a continuation of that activity.
Cadelle and Chafer’s malware
The groups use one malware family each to open a back door and steal information from the
compromised computer. Cadelle uses Backdoor.Cadelspy while Chafer operates with
Backdoor.Remexi and Backdoor.Remexi.B.

Cadelspy initially arrives on the computer as a dropper, which downloads two installer
components catering to whether the victim is running a 32­bit or 64­bit system. The dropper then
executes the appropriate installer, which launches Cadelspy’s malicious payload and allows it to
run whenever any Windows program is executed.
Cadelspy’s main payload contains its back door functionality, allowing the threat to carry out the
following activities:
Log keystrokes and the titles of open windows
Gather clipboard data and system information
Steal printer information and any documents that were sent to be printed
Record audio
Capture screenshots and webcam photos
Cadelspy compresses all of the stolen data into a .cab file and uploads it to the attacker’s C&C
servers. The threat is also able to update its configuration file to gain additional features.
Meanwhile, Chafer’s threat Remexi contains fewer features than Cadelle’s Cadelspy does.
Remexi is a basic back door Trojan that allows attackers to open a remote shell on the computer
and execute commands. Though this is unsophisticated, a remote shell does provide a highly
flexible and powerful means of remote access in the hands of a skilled attacker.
Mitigation
Cadelle and Chafer’s activities show that attack groups don’t need advanced skills to conduct
effective targeted espionage against victims. The two groups’ threats have managed to remain on
their targets’ computers for almost a year, potentially giving the attackers access to an enormous
amount of sensitive information. They’re also aware that they don’t only have to directly attack the
individuals, as they can get to their victims by compromising the services that they use, such as
airlines and telcos.
Both Cadelle and Chafer are still active today and we don’t expect to see them end their activities
any time soon. Individuals and organizations wishing to avoid being compromised by these teams
should adhere to the following advice:
Ensure that software on computers and servers is being regularly updated to prevent known
vulnerabilities from being exploited
Treat unsolicited emails with suspicion. Targeted attacks frequently distribute malware
through malicious links and attachments in emails.
Keep security software up­to­date with the latest definitions
