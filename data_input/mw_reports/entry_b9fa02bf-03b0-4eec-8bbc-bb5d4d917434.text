Executive Summary
On March 2, the world was introduced to four critical zero-day vulnerabilities impacting
multiple versions of Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065). Alongside revealing these vulnerabilities, Microsoft
published security updates and technical guidance that stressed the importance of patching
immediately, while concurrently noting active and ongoing exploitation by an Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) they call HAFNIUM. Since the initial attacks, Unit 42 and a number
of other threat intelligence teams have seen multiple threat groups now exploiting these zeroday vulnerabilities in the wild. Both the vulnerabilities themselves and the access that can be
achieved by exploiting them are significant. It is therefore unsurprising that multiple
attackers sought and continue to seek to compromise vulnerable systems before they are
patched by network administrators. This has been going on at an unprecedented scale – as of
March 8, based on telemetry collected from the Palo Alto Networks Expanse platform, we
estimated there remained over 125,000 unpatched Exchange Servers in the world.
Based on the reconstructed timeline, it’s now clear that there were at least 58 days between
the first known exploitation of this vulnerability on Jan. 3 and when Microsoft released the
patch on March 2. Applying the patch is a necessary first step, but insufficient given the
amount of time the exploit was in the wild. The act of patching will not remediate any access
that attackers may have already gained to vulnerable systems. Organizations can look to our
remediation guide for steps they can take to ensure they have properly secured their
Exchange Servers.

As we enter the second week since the vulnerabilities became public, initial estimates place
the number of compromised organizations in the tens of thousands, thereby dwarfing the
impact of the recent SolarStorm supply chain attack in terms of victims and estimated
remediation costs globally. Given the importance of this event, we are publishing a timeline
of the attack based on our extensive research into the information currently available to us
and our direct experience defending against these attacks. As the situation continues to
unfold, we urge others to also share what they uncover so that we as a cybersecurity
community get a complete picture as quickly as possible.

Microsoft Exchange Server Attack Timeline Summary
This story begins over six months ago when DevCore, a Taiwan-based security consulting
firm, first initiated a project to explore the security of Microsoft Exchange Server products. In
the two-month window between October and December 2020, DevCore researchers made
considerable progress that ultimately led to the discovery of a pre-authentication proxy
vulnerability on Dec. 10, 2020. This vulnerability was given the name ProxyLogon by
DevCore and is now known publicly as CVE-2021-26855.
Following this initial discovery, on Dec. 27, 2020, DevCore researchers demonstrated that
this vulnerability could be leveraged to perform authentication bypass, thereby granting its
users administrator-level permissions on vulnerable Exchange Servers. Shortly after this
discovery, on Dec. 30, 2020, DevCore also discovered a second post-authentication file write
bug that could be chained together with the first vulnerability to gain privileged access to
Exchange Servers and write files of an attacker’s choosing to any directory. This second
vulnerability is now known publicly as CVE-2021-27065.

Given the time of year and the existence of a long New Year’s holiday weekend, DevCore
reached out and notified Microsoft of the vulnerabilities on the following Tuesday (Jan. 5,
2021). At the time, the researcher credited with the discovery of the vulnerabilities tweeted
publicly.

At that point, attacks were already appearing in the wild. Volexity, a US-based security firm,
reported attacks involving the ProxyLogon vulnerability as early as Jan. 3. On Feb. 2, the firm
also reported to Microsoft information about attacks that occurred on Jan. 6.
Concurrently, it is now believed that Dubex, a Denmark-based security firm, first noted
active exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange UMWorkerProcess on Jan. 18, 2021. This
vulnerability is now known as CVE-2021-26857. It was used by an adversary to install
webshells on vulnerable servers consistent with the attacks noted by Volexity. It has been
reported that Dubex notified Microsoft of its findings on Jan. 27, less than 10 days after
initial discovery.

With two cybersecurity vendors providing evidence of active exploitation, DevCore followed
up with Microsoft on Feb. 18, 2021. During the exchange, DevCore provided a draft advisory
notice and requested details concerning the patch release timeline. At the time, Microsoft
shared that they planned to release the patches on March 9.
On Feb. 27, 2021 Microsoft notified DevCore that they were almost ready to release the
security patches. That same day, the cybersecurity community observed an uptick in unusual
webshell activity, and over the following two days, evidence suggests multiple threat groups
began active exploitation activities. ESET reported three separate groups (Tick, LuckyMouse
and Calypso) and our own analysis of webshells deployed in this window has identified six
unique passwords and clusters of activity that further support the claim of multiple threat
groups. It is also worth noting that one of the passwords observed on Feb. 28, 2021 was the
name “orange,” which may serve as a reference to the researcher who originally discovered
the vulnerability.
On March 2, 2021, a week earlier than initially planned, Microsoft published security updates
for the four vulnerabilities. In doing so, they also warned of active exploitation of these
vulnerabilities by a group they named HAFNIUM and further described as a state-sponsored
APT operating out of China.
In the days following the publication of the CVEs, the cybersecurity community has
witnessed a surge of attacks as malicious actors seek to capitalize on the vulnerabilities
before network defenders deploy patches. Over the past week, we have also identified the
emergence of several new webshell passwords and clusters of activity that have overlapping
victim populations. Thus, we currently assess that several additional threat actors with
varying motives have launched efforts to exploit these vulnerabilities as well.
Finally, in terms of the timeline, it is important to consider that while the Microsoft security
updates were released on March 2, 2021, applying these updates only protects organizations
from continued or future exploitation of these vulnerabilities. The security updates do not
provide any protection from previous exploitation that may have resulted in compromise
prior to the publication of the updates.
As documented above, there is definitive evidence that these exploits were in active use as far
back as early January, thus resulting in at least a two-month window of vulnerability.
However, a lack of evidence of exploitation prior to January should not be misinterpreted as
a lack of adversary activity.

Conclusion
Ongoing research illustrates that these vulnerabilities are being used by multiple threat
groups. While it is not new for highly skilled attackers to leverage new vulnerabilities across
varying product ecosystems, the ways in which these attacks are conducted to bypass
authentication -- thereby providing unauthorized access to emails and enabling remote code
execution (RCE) -- is particularly nefarious.
Unit 42 fully expects attacks leveraging these vulnerabilities to not only continue, but to
increase in scope, likely including more varied attacks with different motivations, such as
ransomware infection and/or distribution. Due to the fact that active attacks from various
threat groups leveraging these vulnerabilities is ongoing, it’s imperative to not only patch
affected systems, but also follow the guidance outlined from Unit 42’s previous remediation
blog.
