Google’s mail, workplace productivity, and other business services have helped millions of
people simplify and share their work. Open APIs, extensible integrations, and developerfriendly tools mean that entire virtual offices - complete with virtual workflows - can exist in a
Google ecosystem. Unfortunately, Google’s open and democratized nature is being exploited
by cybercriminals to defraud individuals and organizations of money and sensitive data.
The Armorblox threat research team has seen a sharp uptick in attackers using Google
services to help them get emails past binary security filters based on keywords or URLs. In
this blog, we will outline five targeted phishing campaigns that weaponize various Google
services during their attack flow. These attacks are representative but in no way exhaustive they are the tip of a deep iceberg. If successful, these email attacks using Google services
could have potentially impacted tens of thousands of mailboxes within Armorblox customer
environments alone.

1. American Express Credential Phishing

Attack summary
A credential phishing email impersonating American Express Customer Care that informs
readers that they left out providing some information while validating their card. The email
includes a link where readers can fill in this information and validate their card.

Google service used
The phishing page in the email is hosted on a Google form with a smattering of American
Express branding. This fairly long form asks victims for their American Express login
credentials, card details, and even their mother’s maiden name (which is a common security
question).

Hosting the phishing page on a Google form helps the initial email evade any security filters
that block known bad links or domains. Since Google’s domain is inherently trustworthy and
Google forms are used for several legitimate reasons, no email security filter would
realistically block this link on day zero.

Other techniques used
Impersonation: American Express Customer Care
Social engineering: Time-bound request to validate AmEx card by providing personal
information

2. Benefactor Scam Reconnaissance

Attack summary
Cybercriminals impersonate a childless widow who wants to part with large sums of money
but has nowhere to disburse it. The email asks people interested to receive money to either
click the link in the email or send a reply to the address included in the email body.

Google service used

The link in the email leads to a seemingly empty Google form with an untitled question and
one answer option (Option 1). At first glance, it seems the attackers have been lazy or
negligent, but this is a common reconnaissance technique employed at the start of
targeted email attacks.
Many people will feel the email is suspicious after going through the content and visiting this
dummy form. But some people will submit the only option allowed by the form, or they will
send a reply to the address provided in the email. This allows attackers to shortlist the most
naive and emotionally susceptible email recipients, who will be prime targets for follow-up
emails from the childless widow.

Just like the earlier American Express credential phishing attack, hosting the phishing page
on a Google form here helps the initial email evade any security filters that block known bad
links or domains.

Other techniques used
Impersonation
Social engineering: Emotional request from a widow, temptation of large sums of
money.

3. Security Team Impersonation
Attack summary
Cybercriminals impersonate an organization’s security administrator team with an email that
informs readers that they haven’t received some ‘vital’ emails because of a storage quota
issue. The mail body includes a link for readers to verify their information and resume email

delivery.
A snapshot of the email is given below. We have used a fictional organization called Foxtrot
to showcase this email.

Google service used
The link in the email leads to a fake login page hosted on Firebase, Google’s mobile
platform that enables users to create apps, host files and images, and serve user-generated
content.
The parent URL of the page - https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com - won’t be blocked by
any security filters due to its inherent legitimacy.
The login screen is simple, with the email address of the victim pre entered into the first field.
Imitating ‘quick fill’ techniques used by forms on legitimate websites is commonly used by
cybercriminals to lull victims into a false sense of security.

Other techniques used
Impersonation: security administrator team.
Social engineering: Email focuses on failure to deliver ‘vital’ messages and includes a
link to resume email delivery. The email body includes negative repercussions for lack
of action (failure to verify your email account will lead to suspension and lost data).
Link redirections: the URL in the email goes through one redirection before landing on
the Firebase hosted page, obfuscating the attack flow for any security technology that
attempts to follow the URL to its final destination.

4. Payslip Scam
Attack summary
Cybercriminals impersonate an organization’s payroll team and send an email with payslip
details to victims. The email points readers to a link for them to check if their personal
information for the payslip is accurate. A time-bound request to check the email link adds
urgency and is likely to make victims click without thinking.
This is a variant of the more classic payroll diversion fraud, where cybercriminals
impersonate employees and try to divert payroll funds to their own accounts.

Google service used
The link in the email leads to a page hosted on Google Docs. Since Google Docs is ever
present in our daily lives, the average recipient wouldn’t be surprised to see a Google Docs
link in an email from a colleague. It won’t be blocked by any email security filter either - not
on Day 0, at any rate. Using a Google Doc in this email is meant to trick both the recipient’s
eye test and traditional security layers.

information

Other techniques used
Impersonation: Payroll team.
Targeted email: The email title and body have the recipient’s name to increase
legitimacy.
Social engineering: Finance-related email with a time-bound request to take action
(check if your personal data is correct by 5pm).
Link redirections: The email links to the Google Doc, which further redirects to the final
phishing page (which has now been taken down). These redirections obfuscate link
detection technologies from identifying the URL as malicious.

5. Microsoft Teams Credential Phishing

11/14

Fig: Summary of the Microsoft Teams credential phishing attack

Attack summary
This email claimed to come from the company’s IT team and asked readers to review a
secure message their colleagues had shared over Microsoft Teams, a popular business
collaboration solution. Clicking the link took the targets to a page resembling Microsoft
Teams, which further redirected to the credential phishing site resembling the Office 365
login portal.

Google service used
The Office 365 login portal was hosted on Google Sites, a wiki and web page creation tool
that lowers the skill bar needed to create websites. The malice of the page’s intent was
hidden behind the legitimacy of the page’s domain. This page would pass most eye tests
during busy mornings (which is when the email was sent out), with people happily assuming
it to be a legitimate Microsoft page.

Other techniques used
Impersonation: IT team + Microsoft Teams
Social engineering: Request to view ‘secure’ messages sent over Microsoft Teams

Guidance and Recommendations
1. Follow 2FA and password management best practices
Since all workplace accounts are so closely interlinked, losing access to your Google
account can prove to be very dangerous as cybercriminals send emails in your name to your
customers, partners, and loved ones. If you haven’t already, follow these hygiene best
practices:
Deploy two-factor authentication (2FA) on all possible business and personal accounts.
Use a password manager to store your various account passwords.
Don’t repeat passwords across accounts or use generic passwords such as your birth
date, ‘password123’, ‘YourName123’ etc.

2. Subject sensitive emails to rigorous eye tests
Whenever possible, engage with emails related to money and data in a rational manner.
Subject the email to an eye test that includes inspecting the sender name, sender email
address, language within the email, and any logical inconsistencies within the email (e.g.
why is this childless widow willing to send me millions of dollars?).

3. Create your own lines of authentication
You should try to replicate 2FA, even if in a loose sense, for any email that makes unusual
requests related to money or data. For example, did your HR rep just email you some payroll
details with a Google Doc requesting more information urgently? Call or text the HR rep and
confirm that they sent the email. Even if your colleagues are very busy, they will understand
and appreciate your caution.

4. Augment native email threat detection with additional controls
To augment existing email security capabilities (e.g. Exchange Online Protection for Office
365 or the Advanced Protection Program for G Suite), organizations should invest in
technologies that take a materially different approach to threat detection. Rather than
searching through static lists and blocking known bad domains, these technologies should
learn from custom organizational data and be able to stop socially engineered threats that
contain zero-day payloads like Google Forms, Docs, or pages built on Google Sites.
