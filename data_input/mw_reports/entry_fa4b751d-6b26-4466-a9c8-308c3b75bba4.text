tr1adx Intelligence Bulletin (TIB) 00003: Bear Spotting Vol. 1: Russian Nation State
Targeting of Government and Military Interests
[Published: January 9, 2017]

[Last Updated: January 15, 2017]

Summary
The tr1adx team performs on-going research into Threat Actors, irrespective of their motivation,
provenance, or targets. tr1adx Intelligence Bulletin #00003 shares intel on Russian Nation State Cyber
Activity targeting Government and Military interests around the world. Please note this is an active bulletin,
meaning we will occassionally add intel and information to this bulletin as we uncover new campaigns,
targets or actors which meet the criteria.
tr1adx's research was able to identify targets in various countries and/or regions, including:
Turkey
Japan
Denmark
United States
Venezuela
India
NATO A liated Targets
United Nations

Analysis
TTP's associated with Russian Nation State Threat Actors (Civil and Military Intelligence/GRU/APT28/APT29)
allow us to track these Threat Actors' activities with a high/moderate degree of con dence, and follow their
trail of breadcrumbs through past, present, and future campaigns. While, for operational security reasons,
we cannot go into detail on our techniques, practices, and sources for intelligence collection and analysis, we
can say that the majority of the information published in this bulletin is based on in-depth research
leveraging available Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources. In a few cases, intel data has been enriched
by, derived from, and collected through other non-OSINT means.
