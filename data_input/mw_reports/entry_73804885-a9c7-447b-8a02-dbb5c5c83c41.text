Tailored Access Operations

The Equation Group, classified as an advanced persistent threat, is a highly sophisticated
threat actor suspected of being tied to the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit of the
United States National Security Agency (NSA).[1][2][3] Kaspersky Labs describes them as one
of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world and "the most advanced ... we
have seen", operating alongside the creators of Stuxnet and Flame.[4][5] Most of their targets
have been in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali.[5]
The name originated from the group's extensive use of encryption. By 2015, Kaspersky
documented 500 malware infections by the group in at least 42 countries, while
acknowledging that the actual number could be in the tens of thousands due to its selfterminating protocol.[5][6]
In 2017, WikiLeaks published a discussion held within the CIA on how it had been possible
to identify the group.[7] One commenter wrote that "the Equation Group as labeled in the
report does not relate to a specific group but rather a collection of tools" used for hacking.[8]

Discovery
At the Kaspersky Security Analysts Summit held in Mexico on February 16, 2015, Kaspersky
Lab announced its discovery of the Equation Group. According to Kaspersky Lab's report,
the group has been active since at least 2001, with more than 60 actors.[9] The malware
used in their operations, dubbed EquationDrug and GrayFish, is found to be capable of
reprogramming hard disk drive firmware.[4] Because of the advanced techniques involved
and high degree of covertness, the group is suspected of ties to the NSA, but Kaspersky Lab
has not identified the actors behind the group.

Probable links to Stuxnet and the NSA
In 2015 Kaspersky's research findings on the Equation Group noted that its loader,
"Grayfish", had similarities to a previously discovered loader, "Gauss",[repository] from another
attack series, and separately noted that the Equation Group used two zero-day attacks later
used in Stuxnet; the researchers concluded that "the similar type of usage of both exploits
together in different computer worms, at around the same time, indicates that the EQUATION
group and the Stuxnet developers are either the same or working closely together".[10]: 13

Firmware
They also identified that the platform had at times been spread by interdiction (interception of
legitimate CDs sent by a scientific conference organizer by mail),[10]: 15 and that the platform
had the "unprecedented" ability to infect and be transmitted through the hard drive firmware
of several major hard drive manufacturers, and create and use hidden disk areas and virtual
disk systems for its purposes, a feat which would require access to the manufacturer's
source code to achieve,[10]: 16–18 and that the tool was designed for surgical precision, going
so far as to exclude specific countries by IP and allow targeting of specific usernames on
discussion forums.[10]: 23–26

Codewords and timestamps
The NSA codewords "STRAITACID" and "STRAITSHOOTER" have been found inside the
malware. In addition, timestamps in the malware seem to indicate that the programmers
worked overwhelmingly Monday–Friday in what would correspond to a 08:00–17:00 (8:00
AM - 5:00 PM) workday in an Eastern United States time zone.[11]

The LNK exploit
Kaspersky's global research and analysis team, otherwise known as GReAT, claimed to have
found a piece of malware that contained Stuxnet's "privLib" in 2008.[12] Specifically it
contained the LNK exploit found in Stuxnet in 2010. Fanny is classified as a worm that
affects certain Windows operating systems and attempts to spread laterally via network
connection or USB storage.[repository] Kaspersky stated that they suspect that the Equation
Group
has been around longer than Stuxnet, based on the recorded compile time of Fanny.

Link to IRATEMONK

2/11

The NSA's listing of its Tailored Access Operations program named IRATEMONK from the
NSA ANT catalog.
F-Secure claims that the Equation Group's malicious hard drive firmware is TAO program
"IRATEMONK",[13] one of the items from the NSA ANT catalog exposed in a 2013 Der
Spiegel article. IRATEMONK provides the attacker with an ability to have their software
application persistently installed on desktop and laptop computers, despite the disk being
formatted, its data erased or the operating system re-installed. It infects the hard drive
firmware, which in turn adds instructions to the disk's master boot record that causes the
software to install each time the computer is booted up.[14] It is capable of infecting certain
hard drives from Seagate, Maxtor, Western Digital, Samsung,[14] IBM, Micron Technology
and Toshiba.[4]

2016 breach of the Equation Group
In August 2016, a hacking group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers" announced that it had
stolen malware code from the Equation Group.[15] Kaspersky Lab noticed similarities
between the stolen code and earlier known code from the Equation Group malware samples
it had in its possession including quirks unique to the Equation Group's way of implementing
the RC6 encryption algorithm, and therefore concluded that this announcement is legitimate.
[16] The most recent dates of the stolen files are from June 2013, thus prompting Edward
Snowden to speculate that a likely lockdown resulting from his leak of the NSA's global and
domestic surveillance efforts stopped The Shadow Brokers' breach of the Equation Group.
Exploits against Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances and Fortinet's firewalls were featured in
some malware samples released by The Shadow Brokers.[17] EXTRABACON, a Simple
Network Management Protocol exploit against Cisco's ASA software, was a zero-day exploit
as of the time of the announcement.[17] Juniper also confirmed that its NetScreen firewalls
were affected.[18] The EternalBlue exploit was used to conduct the damaging worldwide
WannaCry ransomware attack.
