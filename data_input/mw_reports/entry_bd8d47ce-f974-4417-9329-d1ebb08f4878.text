As data leak extortion swiftly became the new norm for big game hunting (BGH) ransomware
operators since late 2019, various criminal adversaries began innovating in this area. This
includes collaboration between ransomware groups, auctioning leaked data and demanding
not just one ransom for the ransomware decryptor but also a second ransom to ensure
stolen data is deleted.
The first part of this two-part blog series explored the origins of ransomware, BGH and
extortion and introduced some of the criminal adversaries that are currently dominating the
data leak extortion ecosystem. This blog explores operators of Ako (a fork of MedusaLocker)
demanding two ransoms from victims, PINCHY SPIDER’s auctioning of stolen data and
TWISTED SPIDER’s creation of the self-named “Maze Cartel.”

Twice the Price: Ako Operators Demand Separate Ransoms
In May 2020, CrowdStrike® Intelligence observed an update to the Ako ransomware portal.
Similar to many other ransomware operators, the threat actors added a link to their dedicated
leak site (DLS), as shown in Figure 1. What makes this DLS interesting is an indication that

1/7

the threat actors were likely issuing two ransom demands: one for the victim to obtain the
decryption key and a second to delete the exfiltrated data from the DLS.

One of the threat actor posts (involving a U.S.-based engineering company) included the
following comment:
Got only payment for decrypt – 350,000$
Payment for delete stolen files was not received.
While it appears that the victim paid the threat actors for the decryption key, the exfiltrated
data was still published on the DLS. This inclusion of a ransom demand for the exfiltrated
data is not yet commonly seen across ransomware families.

Going Once, Twice — Sold!
On June 2, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed PINCHY SPIDER introduce a new
auction feature to their REvil DLS. This feature allows users to bid for leak data or purchase
the data immediately for a specified “Blitz Price.” Payments are only accepted in Monero
(XMR) cryptocurrency. These auctions are listed in a specific section of the DLS, which
provides a list of available and previously expired auctions. Each auction title corresponds to
the company the data has been exfiltrated from and contains a countdown timer providing
2/7

the time remaining before the auction expires (Figure 2). Once the auction expires, PINCHY
SPIDER typically provides a link to the company’s data, which can be downloaded from a
public file distribution website.
In order to place a bid or pay the provided Blitz Price, the bidder is required to register for a
particular leak auction. When a leak auction title is clicked, it takes the bidder to a detailed
page containing “Login” and “Registration” buttons, as shown in Figure 2.

The “Login” button can be used to log in as a previously registered user, and the
“Registration” button provides a generated username and password for the auction session.
Once the bidder is authenticated for a particular auction, the resulting page displays auction
deposit amounts, starting auction price, ending auction price, an XMR address to send
transactions to, a listing of transactions to that address, and the time left until the auction
expires, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Registered user leak auction page

A minimum deposit needs to be made to the provided XMR address in order to make a bid. If
the bidder is outbid, then the deposit is returned to the original bidder. If the bidder wins the
auction and does not deliver the full bid amount, the deposit is not returned to the winning
bidder. This protects PINCHY SPIDER from fraudulent bids, while providing confidence to
legitimate bidders that they will have their money returned upon losing a bid. In theory,
PINCHY SPIDER could refrain from returning bids, but this would break the trust of bidders
in the future, thus hindering this avenue as an income stream.
At the time of this writing, CrowdStrike Intelligence had not observed any of the auctions
initiated by PINCHY SPIDER result in payments. If users are not willing to bid on leaked
information, this business model will not suffice as an income stream. Additionally, PINCHY
SPIDER’s willingness to release the information after the auction has expired, which
effectively provides the data for free, may have a negative impact on the business model if
those seeking the information are willing to have the information go public prior to accessing
it.

Enter the Labyrinth: Maze Cartel Encourages Criminal Collaboration
In June 2020, TWISTED SPIDER, the threat actor operating Maze ransomware, introduced a
new twist to their ransomware operations by announcing the creation of the “Maze Cartel” —
a collaboration between certain ransomware operators that results in victims’ exfiltrated
information being hosted on multiple DLSs, as shown in Figure 4.

To date, the Maze Cartel is confirmed to consist of TWISTED SPIDER, VIKING SPIDER (the
operators of Ragnar Locker) and the operators of LockBit. Data-sharing activity observed by
CrowdStrike Intelligence is displayed in Table 1.

In August 2020, operators of SunCrypt ransomware claimed they were a new addition to the
Maze Cartel — the claim was refuted by TWISTED SPIDER. Duplication of a Norway-based
victim’s details on both the TWISTED SPIDER DLS and SunCrypt DLS contributed to
theories the adversaries were collaborating, though the data was also available on criminal
forums at the time it appeared on SunCrypt’s DLS.
Also in August 2020, details of two victims were duplicated on both TWISTED SPIDER’s
DLS and WIZARD SPIDER’s Conti DLS, resulting in theories that WIZARD SPIDER is a new
addition to the Maze Cartel. However, TWISTED SPIDER made no reference to the inclusion
of WIZARD SPIDER, and the duplication is potentially the result of the victims facing two
intrusions by separate ransomware actors, or data being sold by WIZARD SPIDER to other
threat actors.
The exact nature of the collaboration between Maze Cartel’s members is unconfirmed; it is
unknown if the actors actively participate in the same operations. Some of the actors share
similar tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including an initial aversion to targeting
frontline healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are indications that
adversaries are emulating successful techniques demonstrated by other members of the
cartel1. The Maze Cartel creates benefits for the adversaries involved, and potential pitfalls
for victims. Less-established operators can host data on a more-established DLS, reducing
the risk of the data being taken offline by a public hosting provider. TWISTED SPIDER’s
reputation as a prolific ransomware operator arguably bolsters the reputation of the newer
operators and could encourage the victim to pay the ransom demand. A yet-to-be-seen but
realistic threat is that victims whose data is hosted in multiple locations could face
negotiations with multiple ransomware operators, potentially increasing the price of the
ransom to ensure the data’s removal and destruction.

Conclusion
Collaboration between eCrime operators is not uncommon — for example, WIZARD SPIDER
has a historically profitable arrangement involving the distribution of TrickBot by MUMMY
SPIDER in Emotet spam campaigns. However, the apparent collaboration between members
of the Maze Cartel is more unusual and has the potential to alter the TTPs used in the
ransomware threat landscape. Collaboration between operators may also place additional
pressure on the victim to meet the ransom demand, as the stolen data has gained increased
publicity and has already been shared at least once. To date, the collaboration appears to
focus on data sharing, but should the collaboration escalate into combined or consecutive
ransomware operations, then the fallout and impact on victims could become significantly
higher.
The auctioning of victim data enables the monetization of exfiltrated data when victims are
not willing to pay ransoms, while incentivizing the original victims to pay the ransom amount
in order to prevent the information from going public. Double ransoms potentially increase

6/7

the amount of money a ransomware operator can collect, but should the operators demand
the ransoms separately, victims may be more willing to pay for the deletion of data where
receiving decryptors is not a concern. As eCrime adversaries seek to further monetize their
efforts, these trends will likely continue, with the auctioning of data occurring regardless of
whether or not the original ransom is paid.
The collaboration between Maze Cartel members and the auction feature on PINCHY
SPIDER’s DLS may be combined in the future. It is possible that a criminal marketplace may
be created for ransomware operators to sell or auction data, share techniques and even sell
access to victims if they don’t have the time or capability to conduct such operations.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has previously observed actors selling access to organizations on
criminal underground forums. However, these advertisements do not appear to be restricted
to ransomware operations and could instead enable espionage and other nefarious activity.
These evolutions in data leak extortion techniques demonstrate the drive of these criminal
actors to capitalize on their capabilities and increase monetization wherever possible. The
overall trend of exfiltrating, selling and outright leaking victim data will likely continue as long
as organizations are willing to pay ransoms. These tactics enable criminal actors to capitalize
on their efforts, even when companies have procedures in place to recover their data and
are able to remove the actors from their environments.
Currently, the best protection against ransomware-related data leaks is prevention. Security
solutions such as the CrowdStrike Falcon® endpoint protection platform come with many
preventive features to protect against threats like those outlined in this blog series. With
features that include machine learning, behavioral preventions and executable quarantining,
the Falcon platform has proven to be highly effective at stopping ransomware and other
common techniques criminal organizations employ.
