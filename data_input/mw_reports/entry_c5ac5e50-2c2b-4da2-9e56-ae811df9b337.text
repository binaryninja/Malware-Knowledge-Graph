Executive Summary
NetWire is a publicly-available RAT that has been used by criminal organizations and other
malicious groups since 2012. NetWire is distributed through various campaigns, and we
usually see it sent through malicious spam (malspam). GuLoader is a file downloader that
was first discovered in December 2019, and it has been used to distribute a wide variety of
remote administration tool (RAT) malware.
This blog reviews a recent distribution chain in March 2020 using Microsoft Word documents
to distribute NetWire through GuLoader. We review the infection chain of events, examine
the associated network traffic, and cover post-infection artifacts from an infected Windows

host. This material is primarily helpful to Security Operations Center (SOC) personnel like
front-line analysts and people who perform forensic investigations.
This blog covers the following areas:
Chain of events
Email lures
Malicious Word documents
The initial binary
Infection traffic
Forensics on an infected Windows host

Chain of Events
This chain of events kicks off with an email. The email contains a web link for a Microsoft
Word document. The Word document has macro code that retrieves a Windows executable
for GuLoader. The executable retrieves an encrypted data file used for NetWire. Then we
see command and control (C2) traffic for NetWire RAT activity. See Figure 1 for a flow chart
of this infection chain.

Email Lures
Malspam distributing NetWire typically uses attachments or links for the malware. Figure 2
shows one such example from August 2019 with both an attachment and a link for the same
Word document to kick off a NetWire RAT infection.

GuLoader is now widely used for RAT distribution in 2020 and we continue to see the same
type of email lures for malspam pushing NetWIre RAT.
Malicious Word Documents
For an infection chain from March 2020, we clicked on an email link discovered through
AutoFocus to retrieve a malicious Word document as shown in Figure 3.

Our research led us to two links that generated similar infection chains:
hxxp://www.artizaa[.]com/Andys_18US_Tax.doc
hxxp://murthydigitals[.]com/PM_2019_Screen_18_Tax_File.doc
Both links returned Word documents for the same type of NetWire RAT activity. Each
document used a different template. Compare Figure 4 with Figure 5 to see the difference in
each document.

The Initial Binary
Enabling macros for each of these Word documents generated an infection on a vulnerable
Windows host. Each vulnerable host retrieved an initial binary for GuLoader and ran it from
the infected users’ AppData\Local\Temp directory. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show examples
from each Word document.

Infection Traffic
Pcaps of the infection traffic revealed the following:
HTTP request that returned a malicious Word document
HTTP request that returned a malicious Windows executable file (GuLoader)
HTTP request that returned an encoded binary
TCP traffic for NetWire RAT
See Figure 9 and Figure 10 for images of the traffic filtered in Wireshark.

This March 2020 infection traffic follows the same concept for GuLoader to RAT activity
discussed in a previous analysis of GuLoader.
Forensics on an Infected Windows Host
A copy of the initial EXE for GuLoader is made persistent, then the original is deleted from
the infected user’s AppData\Local\Temp directory where it was originally saved. The
GuLoader EXE is persistent through the Windows Registry under the following key:

8/12

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
Two examples of this Registry update are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12.

12. Second example of GuLoader persistent through the Windows Registry
Because this is ultimately a NetWire RAT infection, we can also find a registry update at
HKCU\Software\NetWire like the example shown in Figure 13.

We can also find artifacts associated with a NetWire infection as shown in Figure 14 and
Figure 15.

Conclusion
These types of infections are not very effective against Windows 10 hosts using default
security settings. Versions of Microsoft Office since 2013 have Protected View enabled by
default that prevents users from enabling macros in Word documents downloaded from the
Internet. Furthermore, Real-time protection and Tamper protection settings in Windows
Defender were remarkably effective in preventing these infections within a Windows 10 test
environment. Finally, within 24 hours of discovery, URLs serving the malware associated with
these infections had been taken off-line.
However, criminal distribution of RATs and other types of commodity malware are often a catand-mouse game against security vendors. After one wave of malware is distributed, the
binaries are updated, and another wave is quickly released into the wild. These efforts rely
on wide-scale distribution from the criminals and poor security practices among potential
victims. Only a small percentage infection attempts need to be successful for these efforts to
be cost-effective.
Palo Alto Networks customers are further protected through our threat prevention platform
which is designed to detect and block such threats, and AutoFocus shows these binaries as
malicious. As long as this type of malware distribution remains cost-effective, criminals will

continue to pursue such methods of attack.
