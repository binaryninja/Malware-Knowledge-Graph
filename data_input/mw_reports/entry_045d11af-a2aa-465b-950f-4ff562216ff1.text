WASHINGTON - Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) designated five Iranian entities for attempting to influence elections in the United
States. The Iranian regime has targeted the United States’ electoral process with brazen
attempts to sow discord among the voting populace by spreading disinformation online and
executing malign influence operations aimed at misleading U.S. voters. Components of the
Government of Iran, disguised as news organizations or media outlets, have targeted the
United States in order to subvert U.S. democratic processes.
“The Iranian regime uses false narratives and other misleading content to attempt to
influence U.S. elections,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “This Administration is
committed to ensuring the integrity of the U.S. election system and will continue to counter
efforts from any foreign actor that threatens our electoral processes.”
Treasury designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC-Qods Force
(IRGC-QF), and Bayan Rasaneh Gostar Institute (Bayan Gostar) pursuant to Executive
Order (E.O.) 13848 for having directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed, or
otherwise been complicit in foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The
Iranian Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU) and International Union of Virtual Media

(IUVM) were designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for being owned or controlled by the IRGCQF. The IRGC, including the IRGC-QF, has been designated under multiple authorities since
2007.
The Iranian regime’s disinformation efforts have targeted a global audience through a variety
of covert media organizations. Disinformation campaigns run by the Iranian regime focus on
sowing discord among readers via social media platforms and messaging applications, and
frequently involve mischaracterizing information.
Since at least 2015, Bayan Gostar has served as a front company for IRGC-QF propaganda
efforts. In the months leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Bayan Gostar
personnel have planned to influence the election by exploiting social issues within the United
States, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and denigrating U.S. political figures. As recently
as summer 2020, Bayan Gostar was prepared to execute a series of influence operations
directed at the U.S. populace ahead of the presidential election.

IRTVU, a propaganda arm of the IRGC-QF, and IUVM aided Bayan Gostar in efforts to reach
U.S. audiences. In addition, IRGC-QF outlets amplified false narratives in English, and
posted disparaging propaganda articles and other U.S.-oriented content with the intent to
sow discord among U.S. audiences. IUVM also posted conspiracy theories and
disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Treasury Department encourages the American people to confirm information received
via social media intelligently by going to multiple trusted sources for news and information,
particularly when the source or suspected source of the information is from outside the
United States. More guidance specific to the U.S. 2020 election and disinformation
campaigns can be found here: https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol
