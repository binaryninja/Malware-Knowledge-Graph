December 5, 2019
Washington – Today the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) took action against Evil Corp, the Russia-based cybercriminal organization
responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used
the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks
and financial institutions in over 40 countries, causing more than $100 million in theft. This
malicious software has caused millions of dollars of damage to U.S. and international
financial institutions and their customers. Concurrent with OFAC’s action, the Department of
Justice charged two of Evil Corp’s members with criminal violations, and the Department of
State announced a reward for information up to $5 million leading to the capture or
conviction of Evil Corp’s leader. These U.S. actions were carried out in close coordination
with the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA). Additionally, based on information
obtained by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),
the Treasury Department’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection
(OCCIP) released previously unreported indicators of compromise associated with the
Dridex malware and its use against the financial services sector.
“Treasury is sanctioning Evil Corp as part of a sweeping action against one of the world’s
most prolific cybercriminal organizations. This coordinated action is intended to disrupt the
massive phishing campaigns orchestrated by this Russian-based hacker group,” said Steven
1/5

T. Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury. “OFAC’s action is part of a multiyear effort with key
NATO allies, including the United Kingdom. Our goal is to shut down Evil Corp, deter the
distribution of Dridex, target the “money mule” network used to transfer stolen funds, and
ultimately to protect our citizens from the group’s criminal activities.”
Worldwide, cybercrime results in losses that total in the billions of dollars, while in the United
States, financial institutions and other businesses remain prime targets for cybercriminals.
Today’s action clarifies that, in addition to his involvement in financially motivated cybercrime,
the group’s leader, Maksim Yakubets, also provides direct assistance to the Russian
government’s malicious cyber efforts, highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of
cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes. Maksim Yakubets is not the first cybercriminal
to be tied to the Russian government. In 2017, the Department of Justice indicted two
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers and their criminal conspirators for
compromising millions of Yahoo email accounts. The United States Government will not
tolerate this type of activity by another government or its proxies and will continue to hold all
responsible parties accountable.
Today’s designations and indictments were issued in furtherance of previous international
actions targeting Evil Corp in an effort to further disrupt and degrade the group’s ability to
operate. In October 2015, the Department of Justice indicted Andrey Ghinkul for spreading
the Dridex malware. At that same time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NCA
disrupted the global infrastructure utilized at the time by Evil Corp. Over the past several
years, the NCA and the United Kingdom’s Metropolitan Police Service have arrested multiple
individuals who enabled the activities of Evil Corp, including laundering stolen proceeds
acquired through the Dridex malware.
As a result of today’s designations, all property and interests in property of these persons
subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from
engaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or more owned by
one or more designated persons are also blocked. Foreign persons may be subject to
secondary sanctions for knowingly facilitating a significant transaction or transactions with
these designated persons.

Designation Targets
Today’s action targets 17 individuals and seven entities to include Evil Corp, its core cyber
operators, multiple businesses associated with a group member, and financial facilitators
utilized by the group. OFAC designated these persons pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.)
13694, as amended, which targets malicious cyber-enabled actors around the world, and as
codified by the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

Evil Corp is the Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development
and distribution of the Dridex malware. The Dridex malware is a multifunctional malware
package that is designed to automate the theft of confidential information, to include online
banking credentials from infected computers. Dridex is traditionally spread through massive
phishing email campaigns that seek to entice victims to click on malicious links or
attachments embedded within the emails. Once a system is infected, Evil Corp uses
compromised credentials to fraudulently transfer funds from victims’ bank accounts to those
of accounts controlled by the group. As of 2016, Evil Corp had harvested banking
credentials from customers at approximately 300 banks and financial institutions in over 40
countries, making the group one of the main financial threats faced by businesses. In
particular, Evil Corp heavily targets financial services sector organizations located in the
United States and the United Kingdom. Through their use of the Dridex malware, Evil Corp
has illicitly earned at least $100 million, though it is likely that the total of their illicit proceeds
is significantly higher. As a result of this activity, Evil Corp is being designated pursuant to
E.O. 13694, as amended, for engaging in cyber-enabled activities that have the effect of
causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources for private financial
gain.
Evil Corp operates as a business run by a group of individuals based in Moscow, Russia,
who have years of experience and well-developed, trusted relationships with each other.
Maksim Yakubets (Yakubets) serves as Evil Corp’s leader and is responsible for managing
and supervising the group’s malicious cyber activities. For example, as of 2017, Yakubets
supervised Evil Corp actors who were attempting to target U.S. companies. As of 2015,
Yakubets maintained control of the Dridex malware and was in direct communication with
Andrey Ghinkul prior to the unsealing of his indictment. As a result, Yakubets is being
designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having acted for or on behalf of and for
providing material assistance to Evil Corp. Prior to serving in this leadership role for Evil
Corp, Yakubets was also directly associated with Evgeniy Bogachev, a previously designated
Russian cybercriminal responsible for the distribution of the Zeus, Jabber Zeus, and
GameOver Zeus malware schemes. In particular, Yakubets was responsible for recruiting
and managing a network of individuals responsible for facilitating the movement of money
illicitly gained through the efforts spearheaded by Evgeniy Bogachev. Yakubets is the
subject of an indictment and criminal complaint unsealed today by the Department of Justice,
while the Department of State announced a $5 million reward for information leading to the
capture of Yakubets.
In addition to his leadership role within Evil Corp, Yakubets has also provided direct
assistance to the Russian government. As of 2017, Yakubets was working for the Russian
FSB, one of Russia’s leading intelligence organizations that was previously sanctioned
pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, on December 28, 2016. As of April 2018, Yakubets
was in the process of obtaining a license to work with Russian classified information from the
FSB. As a result, Yakubets is also being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended,

for providing material assistance to the FSB. Additionally, as of 2017, Yakubets was tasked
to work on projects for the Russian state, to include acquiring confidential documents
through cyber-enabled means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf.
Another key Evil Corp figure targeted today is Igor Turashev (Turashev). As of 2017,
Turashev was involved in helping Evil Corp exploit victims’ networks. As of 2015, Turashev
served as an administrator for Yakubets and had control over the Dridex malware. As a
result, Turashev is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having acted
for or on behalf of and for providing material assistance to Evil Corp. Turashev is also the
subject of an indictment unsealed today by the Department of Justice.
Denis Gusev (Gusev), a senior member of Evil Corp, is also being designated today for his
active role in furthering Evil Corp’s activities. As of 2017, Gusev was involved in helping Evil
Corp move to a new office location and as of 2018, Gusev served as a financial facilitator for
Evil Corp and its members. As a result, Gusev is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694,
as amended, for having acted for or on behalf of and for providing material assistance to Evil
Corp.
Gusev also serves as the General Director for six Russia-based businesses. These entities
include Biznes-Stolitsa, OOO, Optima, OOO, Treid-Invest, OOO, TSAO, OOO, Vertikal,
OOO, and Yunikom, OOO. As a result, these entities are being designated pursuant to E.O.
13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled by Gusev.
In addition to Yakubets, Turashev, and Gusev, Evil Corp relies upon a cadre of core
individuals to carry out critical logistical, technical, and financial functions such as managing
the Dridex malware, supervising the operators seeking to target new victims, and laundering
the proceeds derived from the group’s activities. These additional core members of the
group include Dmitriy Smirnov, Artem Yakubets, Ivan Tuchkov, Andrey Plotnitskiy,
Dmitriy Slobodskoy, and Kirill Slobodskoy. As a result, these six individuals are being
designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having acted for or on behalf of and for
providing material assistance to Evil Corp.
To transfer the proceeds gained through their use of the Dridex malware, Evil Corp relies
upon a network of money mules who are involved in transferring stolen funds obtained from
victims’ bank accounts to accounts controlled by members of Evil Corp. Previously, the NCA
arrested multiple individuals in the United Kingdom suspected of laundering the criminal
profits of cybercrime schemes, including those perpetrated by Evil Corp, through hundreds of
accounts at various banks in the United Kingdom. Today, OFAC is designating eight
Moscow-based individuals who have served as financial facilitators for Evil Corp. These
individuals include Aleksei Bashlikov, Ruslan Zamulko, David Guberman, Carlos
Alvares, Georgios Manidis, Tatiana Shevchuk, Azamat Safarov, and Gulsara
Burkhonova. As a result, these eight individuals are being designated pursuant to E.O.
13694, as amended, for providing financial and material assistance to Evil Corp.
