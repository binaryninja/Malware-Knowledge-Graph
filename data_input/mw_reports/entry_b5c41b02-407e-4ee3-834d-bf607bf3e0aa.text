Executive Summary
Malware analysis forms a vital part of cyber threat intelligence
operations. Yet the proliferation of binary-focused analysis enabled by
tools such as VirusTotal that make samples available widely absent
victim and use context yield analysis lacking significant amplifying
information. This is not to say that any specific malware analysis
performed is wrong, but rather that malware-exclusive analysis may
miss contextuality, significance, and use-cases that are vital aspects
of understanding a security incident.
Looking at some high-profile instances from the past four years of
security reporting, there are many examples of excellent technical
reports in isolation which nonetheless miss some critical aspects of
certain security incidents or appear to indicate connections that
greater context reveals as unsupported. By incorporating other
aspects of security event analysis – host artifacts, network
infrastructure, network traffic, and where possible adversary
motivations and objectives – cyber threat intelligence analysts can
gain greater, more accurate insight into activities.
Ultimately, threat intelligence producers will rarely have the “full
picture” of an incident, but whether limited to malware or some other
single aspect of an event, analysts must ensure that resulting products
are properly dispositioned and resulting conclusions supported by the
available evidence. Threat intelligence consumers must realize the
limitations faced by producers and formulate their own analysis and
integration of third-party threat intelligence to incorporate other
sources to fill in gaps where possible. Recognizing the limitations of
analysis based on small sample sizes using only a single analytical
method means network defenders overall, and threat intelligence
practitioners specifically, can accurately categorize observations and
apply controls and defenses in a supportable fashion.

Introduction
The commercial threat intelligence field largely came into existence with the publication
of the Mandiant APT1 report in 2013. 1 While previous reports on cyber threats existed,
many took the form of one-off blogs, or media stories lacking the analytic rigor currently
associated with cyber threat intelligence reporting. 2 Initially, non-government threat
intelligence was limited to entities with direct access to data as a result of incident
response work, security tool telemetry, or other direct exposure to events. However, the
launch of VirusTotal by Spanish security company Hispasec significantly changed
matters. 3 Initially designed as a mechanism for users to perform security scans of files
using multiple anti-virus (AV) products on its debut in 2004, the service gradually
expanded (especially following acquisition by Google in 2012) to provide a paid service
enabling researchers (and companies) beyond the participating AV vendors to retrieve
files for analysis.
With this move, an entirely new field of security research opened with the availability of
a large corpus of malware samples beyond any researcher’s or company’s individual
experience and actions. While this resulted in an explosion of research and analysis of
malicious software, this shift also generated an ecosystem where threat intelligence and
analysis became increasingly dominated by pure malware analysis.
The question we as practitioners now face is, while the benefits of greater exposure,
sharing, and availability have produced a dramatically larger corpus of analysis and
information, has this effort come at a cost? This paper will argue that while malware
analysis offers significant benefits for generating threat intelligence, it is not perfect.
Particularly, malware analysis on its own imposes certain limitations on contextuality
and purpose, important items that are typically unavailable in pure binary or malware
sample examination. Understanding these limitations and adjusting for them
nonetheless allows defenders to incorporate this information, provided the results can
be placed in proper context.

Goal of Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence is typically defined as knowledge that enables defensive action, 4 or
knowledge that allows for prevention or mitigation of attacks. 5 There are many
examinations producing more specific definitions, as well as multiple frameworks for
organizing or systematizing threat intelligence information and knowledge, but these
general definitions are sufficient for our current purposes. More importantly, the
fundamental goal of threat intelligence is to provide some mechanism for an
organization to prepare for, or defend against, an event or attack which it has not already

been the victim of; or, to provide mechanisms to identify an intrusion which may have
otherwise gone unnoticed.
Thus, threat intelligence’s value proposition to an organization comes explicitly from its
ability to enable and enhance operations. This can range from something as simple as
distributing raw observables or more refined indicators of compromise (IOC) to detailing
attacker techniques and methodologies around which more complex (and robust)
defense can be built. 6 In either case, network defenders, or those charged with evaluating
(and accepting) network security risk, should be able to extract actionable, practical
value for threat intelligence to be of use. While information and reporting that does not
meet these criteria of usefulness and actionability may be quite interesting, for practical
defensive purposes they become so much “frictionless spinning in a void”. 7

Figure 1: Cyber Threat Intelligence Evolution

Ultimately, we want cyber threat intelligence to follow a sequence of actions yielding
greater understanding of the threat environment. Raw data analysis and IOC tracking
generates the foundation upon which we can then begin to piece together different
observables to yield more general adversary behaviors. Based on these behaviors and
adversary tendencies, defenders can begin articulating specific defensive measures and
mitigations to counteract adversary behavior (or queries and searches to identify if that
actor is already present). Additionally, organizational leadership can take portions of this
information to judge the risk faced by their operation, either from specific behaviors or
techniques to which they may be susceptible or from certain types of actor based on
assessed objectives and goals.

Investigation and Malware Analysis
Malicious software, or malware, forms part of many (if not most) network security
incidents, from highly complex, custom-developed binaries to scripting objects built
from public repositories. Malware analysis is the practice of “dissecting malware to
understand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it.” 8
The progression of deliverables from understanding functionality, developing
mechanisms to recognize, then building countermeasures against malware roughly fits
the criteria established above for threat intelligence. Analysis of a given sample should
yield more than an investigation of an esoteric encoding/decoding routine or evasion
technique, but also seek to identify practical mechanisms to identify and defeat these
techniques, or some other aspect of the malware’s functionality so as to inhibit its
effectiveness and usefulness.
Historically, malware analysis took place either as part of a broader security
investigation or incident response, or among small groups of researchers who could
share samples – and context around where the samples came from and their assessed
purpose. In these cases, malware analysis came with contextuality: why it was
significant, where it was located, how it was used, and what its immediate defensive
implications were. In the last decade or so, the proliferation of sample sharing and
distribution portals, whether commercial (VirusTotal) or free (Any.Run, Malshare) 9 have
enabled wider distribution and greater availability of malware samples – but at the cost
of stripping context from them.
While samples now lack valuable contextual information surrounding their use and
origin, much of the process of malware analysis can nonetheless take place. As a result,
purely technical analysis can flourish, removed from any grounding in network or security
operations.

Issues, Concerns, and Limitations
Malware analysis is an important, and often invaluable, portion of overall threat
intelligence operations. Yet malicious file analysis also represents but one technique
among many for understanding and analyzing adversary behavior. Understanding
malware functionality (and how to defeat it) is undeniably important, but in isolation
from other factors or absent execution context it may be significantly less useful than it
otherwise would be with additional, enriching information.

Figure 2: Security Incident Components

A security incident consists of three general components: host artifacts and tools;
network data and traffic analysis; and adversary objectives or intentions. A ransomware
attack would consist of the specific ransomware malware involved, the means through
which it propagated across the network, or entered into the environment in the first place
and the adversary’s purpose (ostensibly to make money, although items such as
NotPetya can muddy these waters) 10. Yet a malware-specific approach to such an
investigation, especially if the only data source is a sample sharing service, provides
only the ransomware as an object for investigation and analysis. There is much that can
be learned from the sample, but depending on its functionality, there may be multiple
other steps or necessary observables required to identify critical defensive needs – such
as propagation mechanisms, host artifacts specific to the victim’s network (as opposed
to the analysis environment), network traffic patterns, and related information. Malware
analysis on its own only gets us part of the way to answering these questions in many
circumstances.

Threat Intelligence and the Limits of Malware Analysis, by Joe Slowik | Dragos, Inc

Examining specific circumstances, where an overemphasis on malware analysis was
used to formulate conclusions, we can identify cases not necessarily representing
mistakes, but where matters were less useful than they could be or failed to capture
certain degrees of nuance. Thus, analysts generated and disseminated threat
intelligence, but the resulting product may not have been as complete, accurate, or useful
lacking broader event context from other sources and analytical mechanisms.

2016 UKRAINE POWER EVENT
The 2016 Ukraine power event represented the first known electric power incident
induced through malware. 11 While some preliminary conference talks addressed the
event along with media reporting, the first technically detailed, published report was
ESET’s analysis of Industroyer, followed by publication under the name CRASHOVERRIDE
by Dragos. ESET’s report appeared to cover multiple phases of the intrusion, which
initially seemed to originate from a remote access tool (RAT) facilitating network access
which enabled deployment of the actual electric transmission manipulation software.
The tools were grouped as distinct stages in a single intruder event, building up along
typical kill chain steps to final actions on objectives through the ICS payload. From a
pure malware analysis perspective, this approach makes sense as the identification of
the set of tools associated with the incident including a backdoor or RAT combined with
industrial control-specific malware indicates that the former would be used to position
and then execute the latter.
While initial analysis of the malware is accurate in terms of each sample’s capability, the
absence of contextual incident information left some items (such as additional
adversary actions to enable malware installation) unexplained. There were some hints
in public talks and media reporting as to the greater scope of the event, but no in-depth,
written technical coverage. 12 Reports emerging years after the event, in 2018 and 2019,
eventually addressed in detail how multiple tools were in play in the victim network, and
execution of the industrial control system (ICS) specific portion of the attack does not
appear necessarily linked to the backdoor. 13 Furthermore, while some such as Oleksii
Yasynskyi had publicly hinted that multiple entities were likely involved in the 2016 power
event, 14 more recent review of events shows apparently different adversary intrusion
techniques in play. Enterprise IT intrusion steps displayed a significantly different set of
behaviors than the ICS-focused portion of the attack. This observed bifurcation appeared
to confirm a multiple actor intrusion hypothesis.
A few years after the incident, ESET identified new malware, called EXARAMEL, with
significant functional overlap with the 2016 Ukraine event backdoor. Based on the
technical overlap and a malware-centric investigative approach, previous analysis
looking at the power event as a single-actor incident supported transitive attribution that
the users (or at least authors) of EXARAMEL were also responsible for not merely the

Threat Intelligence and the Limits of Malware Analysis, by Joe Slowik | Dragos, Inc

8

Industroyer backdoor, but the overall 2016 Ukraine power event. In the case of
EXARAMEL, ESET analysts were able to link this malware to TeleBots, known elsewhere
as Sandworm. 15 Given past analysis and the backdoor code overlap, by extension 2016
Ukraine appears to become a Sandworm event.
Yet analysis incorporating information from the victim environment and the overall
intrusion – not available if conducting or limited to pure binary analysis – indicates a
more subtle operation as outlined above. Instead of a single, monolithic intrusion, the
2016 Ukraine event appears to be a case where at least two distinct teams were
operating at different stages of the incident: Sandworm serving as an initial access and
penetration team, handing over access to ELECTRUM as an ICS-specialist group to
perform final control system network penetration and the ICS attack.
Key points establishing this differentiation center around the Sandworm-linked backdoor
similar to EXARAMEL. Analyzing available event data shows no evidence that the
backdoor is linked to the introduction of the ICS attack payloads, or in their execution in
the victim environment. Instead, these stages of the incident use separate sets of
techniques, including simple scripting, built-in operating system tools, and credential reuse. Additionally, network infrastructure associated with the backdoor maps to known
Sandworm tendencies (e.g., using servers also functioning as TOR infrastructure at the
time of the incident), while other network infrastructure more closely aligned with the
ICS-specific portion of events lack these characteristics. A summary of these
differences is provided in Figure 3 below.

While initial reporting on Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE within the context of the 2016
Ukraine event provided significant information for defensive response, it did so largely
in context of observed malware alone. Thus, the picture provided was incomplete and
lacked insight into, and coverage of, critical aspects of the event: penetration of the
control system network and execution of potentially destructive malware in the
environment. 16 Once additional, detailed information became available, a more thorough
analysis became possible, yielding not only distinct phases of adversary operation (one
relying mostly on custom malware, the other primarily on “living off the land”
techniques), but possibly distinct entities involved in the event as well. From a threat
intelligence application, this more complete picture empowers more effective, broader
reaching defense.

ACTOR LINKING ON TOOLS
One common methodology in malware-focused threat intelligence, observed to some
degree in the discussion above given connections between the Industroyer backdoor and
EXARAMEL, is grouping activity based on tool use and design. However, while ESET’s
analysis of EXARAMEL strongly suggests additional telemetry was used to tie
EXARAMEL to Sandworm, many other similar assessments are made purely on malware
analysis alone. In these cases, analysts can quickly reach problematic conclusions as
they effectively focus more on developers or capability sources rather than actors or
executors.
The most obvious cases where researchers can get into difficulty concerns publicly- or
commercially available tools. As attackers have broadened arsenals away from primary
reliance on custom-developed malware for operations to embrace a combination of open
source (e.g., Mimikatz) 17, criminal source (e.g., PlugX) 18, and commercial (e.g.,
CobaltStrike) 19 tools, linking activity to an entity or campaign based purely on tool use
becomes very problematic. The proliferation of tools such as PlugX, ChinaChopper,
njRAT, and the host of open-source libraries now used by attackers make tool-centric
attribution increasingly weak in many cases. This can result in attribution errors, which
in turn can lead to false assumptions on other aspects of the given attack lifecycle –
such as accompanying, expected behaviors and attacker objectives. The result is
inaccurate or faulty overall threat intelligence that can lead to problematic or erroneous
responses.
A more interesting variant of this phenomenon of tool tracking occurs when considering
development and division of labor for threat actors. Malicious cyber entities need not be
monolithic bodies with dedicated development resources working exclusively to support
a certain threat actor. Instead, for the most complex and well-resourced entities,
separate operational teams are likely supported by development shops, contractors, or
even commercial acquisition. These entities in turn may contribute tools and capabilities

Threat Intelligence and the Limits of Malware Analysis, by Joe Slowik | Dragos, Inc

10

to multiple distinct entities. Furthermore, in shallow pools of elite talent, individual
developers and related entities may shift jobs or roles resulting in similar coding patterns
and technical “tells” migrating with individuals or even contracted teams when they
begin supporting a different entity. Thus, tracking even custom tools may reveal more
about developers than it yields on operational teams and their objectives.
Some headline discoveries on what appear to be clusters of activity – such as Animal
Farm or Equation Group-related malware 20 – may therefore track development resources
and not actual operational teams.

As outlined in Figure 4, complex, well-resourced entities (such as state-sponsored
activities) feature multiple tiers and centers of activity from operational or national
command authority through various tool and capability development shops until finally
reaching operational teams. The various entities operating may overlap, follow similar
operational and technical guidance, or in some cases (such as distinct “splits” in state

11

power centers, such as NSA vs. CIA in the United States, FSB/SVR vs. GRU in Russia, or
MOIS vs. IRGC in Iran) entities serving similar interests or goals may operate in
completely different ways.

Figure 5: Tool Usage Compared to Operational Authority and Execution

While the technical analysis linking groups in efforts such as Animal Farm, Equation
Group, the totality of legacy Sandworm reporting, and similar items reflects excellent
malware analysis capability, lack of additional context or exposure to precise lines of
development, communication, and operation mean specific relationships can be
obscured. Looking at something like Equation Group-related tooling, researchers may
have identified a common contractor working for multiple distinct entities instead of
identifying some overarching, coordinated development program for advanced malware
tools shared among partnering organizations. The latter possibility certainly exists, but
its provability remains relatively low in likelihood absent additional information beyond
malware samples to tie identified tools to specific actors and objectives.
Visualizing a division of labor emblematic of complex, bureaucratic systems means
intentions, capabilities, and actions are handed off between multiple discrete entities.
Some of these entities may solely support given actors at different levels, while others
shift depending on tasking, priorities, and resource requirements. Thus, as shown in
Figure 5, specific tool continuity may persist among different actors for a specific
operation or goal, but need not hold for future operations that require different coalitions
of actors and entities to achieve actions on objectives.

Threat Intelligence and the Limits of Malware Analysis, by Joe Slowik | Dragos, Inc

12

None of this should be construed as saying the binary analysis in work cited above is
somehow wrong. Rather, this serves as a caution that the perceived relationships yielded
through a single type of data and a single type of analysis can (and almost certainly will)
possess holes or permit misconceptions to proliferate. Drawing overarching conclusions
from such activity and bundling this into guidance and threat intelligence may therefore
broadcast relationships that are far different to what they may seem through a
circumscribed field of view.

LOOKBACK AND APT10
Finally, malware analysis is subject to adversaries who may deliberately manipulate
tooling or take advantage of potential researcher biases to induce inconclusive or
misleading results. While examples of interesting “false flags” exist such as Olympic
Destroyer, 21 a more recent and potentially interesting example can be found in phishing
activity targeting North American electric utilities in 2019. From August to September
2019, researchers at Proofpoint identified a phishing campaigned they call LookBack,
utilizing spoofed network infrastructure and emails to deliver malware to electric
utilities. 22
Specific aspects of this phishing campaign were exceptionally strange as they seemed
to completely replicate techniques employed by a different entity, thought to be APT10,
that were publicly disclosed in great detail nearly a year prior by FireEye. 23 Examples of
near identical overlap include campaign-specific items from 2018 events such as
mimicking the Generic Updater (GUP) service used by Notepad++ and using a version of
Windows LIBCURL with a malicious exported function to obscure execution. Overall,
LookBack appears to be either APT10 completely replaying known tradecraft in a new
incident, or a very deliberate attempt to mimic well-known behaviors associated with
APT10.

Figure 6: LockBack Exploitation and Execution Chain

Threat Intelligence and the Limits of Malware Analysis, by Joe Slowik | Dragos, Inc

13

This precise adherence to disclosed, legacy tradecraft raises many questions.
Presumably, given detailed previous public reporting, an adversary demonstrating past
sophistication and dedicated support or development resources to enable campaigns
such as Cloud Hopper would not resort to such an obvious replay of known techniques. 24
If we accept this premise (and it must be noted, this is an assumption, and adversaries
can certainly be lazy), then some other entity would need to be involved. The resulting
possible conclusion would be an entity working to look like APT10.
Although incomplete given the relatively small number of available samples from this
event, there are some subtle indications that the document dropper may share some
design and functionality overlap with document droppers previously used by entities
linked to North Korean interests from 2016 through 2017. 25 In addition to this potential
technical overlap, there is also precedent for North Korean-related entities targeting the
US electric sector via phishing with spoofed documents to drop and execute encoded
malware. 26 Thus two datapoints emerge which may suggest an alternative explanation
for the observed activity.
While threat attribution may seem a lower priority than identifying the attack
mechanisms and defenses, from a threat intelligence informing operations perspective
it is significant in this case given the substantial differences in likely adversary
objectives. For example, APT10 is associated with long-running access and information
gathering operations with no publicly known instances leveraging intrusions for
deliberate disruption or destruction. Meanwhile, the North Korean linked activity, while
also encompassing some traditional intelligence collection, extends to potentially
disruptive activity such as cryptocurrency mining and financial theft, and deliberate
disruptive behavior such as ransomware or wipers. Thus, attribution based on this
information has implications for just what risks a potential victim would face from a
potential LookBack-related intrusion, and the appropriate responses for mitigating them.
Overall, this campaign represents a case where it is simply too early (given available
information) to make either assessment, at least with a high degree of confidence. To
the original reporter’s credit, this uncertainty is documented and reflected in public
releases around LookBack. While Proofpoint articulated their reporting with proper
caveats and estimative language, in many cases temptations exist to take limited
information born solely of analysis of a handful of samples to make claims which may
not withstand further scrutiny. Worse yet, in some cases analysis based on small sample
sets may become revealed as outright false with additional evidence. Given limited
information, threat intelligence based on a single analytical technique and a handful of
samples must realize the limitations imposed on any conclusions. Finally, these
limitations must be clearly and explicitly communicated to recipients so they can
disposition the resulting report and intelligence appropriately.

14

Defensive Options and Implications
None of the above represent existential threat intelligence issues, but these examples
illustrate how analytic tendencies and dependencies can yield less than ideal results.
This covers both threat intelligence producers, who must be cognizant of the limitations
that narrow, incomplete source analysis place on conclusions, and threat intelligence
consumers, who need to assess received reporting considering how it was produced to
determine actual relevance and efficacy.
Malware analysis will remain a very important aspect of threat intelligence production
for the foreseeable future. But understanding precisely how it fits in to the overall
intelligence analysis and production process is necessary to ensure practitioners and
consumers do not assign greater confidence to matters than necessary. Thus, defenders
can still extract value from even a single source of malicious software – but must
appropriately couch analysis, recognizing what inherent limitations are thus placed on
conclusions given lack of amplifying information or contextual clues. Use of proper
estimative language, confidence levels, and related techniques can allow threat
intelligence producers to adequately and accurately disposition results.
From a threat intelligence consumer perspective, the nature of threat intelligence
production means that in many cases reports will be based on limited or incomplete
data, especially for new or emerging items. Knowing this limitation, especially in the case
of single-source analysis such as a malware-only report, can allow defenders to
therefore properly assess the strength and applicability of such a report and its findings.
Furthermore, knowing this limitation means threat intelligence consumers cannot be
merely passive recipients, but must engage in active research, analysis, and correlation
of sources to identify potential holes and limitations in received information. This may
seem undesirable as essentially reproducing the analysis and production stage of the
intelligence cycle. Yet defenders and threat intelligence consumers must apply allsource analysis and cross-source correlation to identify and, where possible, fill in
important contextual gaps.
Threat intelligence practitioners must understand the limitations placed on certain types
of analysis, accept that limited sourcing or single-analysis examination will leave holes,
and report such items with the proper use of estimative language and justifiable
conclusions. Organizations can still produce valuable, actional intelligence, but by
adding these extra steps and recognizing limitations in techniques, practitioners can
generate better reporting at appropriate levels of confidence. Furthermore, while this
specific report focused only on malware analysis, this is just an example as similar
issues can emerge in pure network infrastructure tracking (especially when pivoting to
identify related items), or analysis based on a single incident where many observations
may be specific to the victim environment.

Conclusion
The increased availability of malware samples to companies and
researchers has energized and broadened the field of cyber threat
intelligence, allowing for new discoveries and enhancing defense.
However, while beneficial in multiple ways, many aspects of the
industry may rely too much on this single form of analysis and place
greater confidence in discoveries from isolated malware samples than
is justified. Threat intelligence practitioners and consumers must
therefore work to understand the limitations of any single-source,
small sample size examination, and measure expectations and
evaluations appropriately. Furthermore, this concern is neither unique
nor limited to malware analysis as a discipline, but applies to all facets
of threat intelligence.
When analyzing events or campaigns, threat intelligence professionals
must work toward integrating as many data sources and samples as
possible to produce high-confidence analysis. Recognizing that this is
not always possible, organizations must then ensure appropriate
estimative language and confidence assessments are applied to
ensure conclusions are sound and that analytical leaps and pivots are
clearly identified, underlying logic is justified, and analytical leaps
supportable through some evidence. Working in this fashion, the field
of cyber threat intelligence can continue moving forward, yielding
appropriately beneficial and actionable results to consumers, enabling
improved defenses.
