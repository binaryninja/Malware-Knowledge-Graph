Linking Vatet, PyXie and Defray777
While researching these malware families, we found that there were several consistencies
between Vatet, PyXie and Defray777 that strongly suggest that all three malware families
were created, and are currently maintained by, the same financially motivated threat group.
PDB Path Reuse
As we saw with the Defray777 decryptors, there are numerous victims that have been
impacted by Defray777. However, these decryptors also show some overlap with PyXie. One
of the decryptors we analyzed shares a common path with earlier versions of PyXie and its

Additionally, some of the variants of Vatet we observed also have overlapping PDB paths.

String Encryption
During our research, we observed that the method of string encryption in each of the variants
was consistent. Defray777 uses the same string encryption that was used in PyXie.
Additionally, the same string encryption methodology was observed in the Tetris variant of
Vatet loader.

Creating Mutexes

2/3

Defray777 uses the same Mutex routine as the updated PyXie sample we analyzed,
including the DEFAULTCOMPNAME fallback. One thing Defray777 does differently is that it
omits the step where the computed MD5 hash is XOR’d with 0x2.

Conclusion
Since 2018, a financially-motivated threat group has been using a combination of Vatet
loader, PyXie RAT and Defray777 ransomware to target organizations in the healthcare,
education, government and technology industries without drawing attention to themselves.
They’ve only been a blip on the radar.
We have exposed this group’s desire to use open source tools as a means for the Vatet
loader. We have shown how PyXie is used to conduct reconnaissance and find and exfiltrate
data. We have also uncovered how this group uses Cobalt Strike to deliver Defray777 into
memory to encrypt files, causing catastrophic damage to their victims.
We hope that by shining more light on this group of threat actors, we can help disrupt their
ability to conduct ransomware operations. Now that they are on the radar, we must aim to
keep them there.
