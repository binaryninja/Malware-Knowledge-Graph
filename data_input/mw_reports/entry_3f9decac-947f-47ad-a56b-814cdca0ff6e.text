Updates Regarding VSA Security Incident
July 26, 2021 - 1:00 PM EDT
Throughout this past weekend, Kaseya’s Incident Response team and Emsisoft partners
continued their work assisting our customers and others with restoration of their encrypted
data. We continue to provide the decryptor to customers that request it, and we encourage
all our customers whose data may have been encrypted during the attack to reach out to
your contacts at Kaseya. The decryption tool has proven 100% effective at decrypting files
that were fully encrypted in the attack.

1/27

Kaseya has maintained our focus on assisting our customers, and when Kaseya obtained
the decryptor last week we moved as quickly as possible to safely use the decryptor to help
our customers recover their encrypted data. Recent reports have suggested that our
continued silence on whether Kaseya paid the ransom may encourage additional
ransomware attacks, but nothing could be further from our goal. While each company must
make its own decision on whether to pay the ransom, Kaseya decided after consultation
with experts to not negotiate with the criminals who perpetrated this attack and we have not
wavered from that commitment. As such, we are confirming in no uncertain terms that
Kaseya did not pay a ransom – either directly or indirectly through a third party – to obtain
the decryptor.

July 23, 2021 - 3:00 PM EDT
Kaseya’s Incident Response team, assisted by Emsisoft, continues to provide our
customers with the decryption key and help them to restore any encrypted data that was not
previously restored from backup. We have no reports of problems or issues with the
decryptor.

July 22, 2021 - 3:30 PM EDT
Kaseya has obtained universal decryptor key.
On 7/21/2021, Kaseya obtained a decryptor for victims of the REvil ransomware attack, and
we’re working to remediate customers impacted by the incident.
We can confirm that Kaseya obtained the tool from a third party and have teams actively
helping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments, with no
reports of any problem or issues associated with the decryptor. Kaseya is working with
Emsisoft to support our customer engagement efforts, and Emsisoft has confirmed the key
is effective at unlocking victims.
We remain committed to ensuring the highest levels of safety for our customers and will
continue to update here as more details become available.
Customers who have been impacted by the ransomware will be contacted by Kaseya
representatives.

July 19, 2021 - 3:15 PM EDT

VSA Install Patch Check

3/27

When running the Kinstall patch on your VSA, if you chose to reinstall VSA and either
unchecked the default option to install the latest patch, or reran the Reinstall VSA process
a 2nd time without the “install patch” option selected – it’s possible your patch was not reapplied.
While these are rare edge cases, we recommend that you verify that the latest patch was
installed properly. We have made a tool that enables you to ensure the patch is properly
install.
Download the verification tool at:

For on-premises customers we will be publishing a runbook of the changes to make to
your on-premises environment by 3PM US EDT today so customers can prepare for
the patch release.
We will update the planned availability of the VSA On-Premises patch by 5PM US

VSA SaaS Update
During the VSA SaaS deployment an issue was discovered that has blocked the
release. We are resolving the issue that is related to our SaaS infrastructure and we
plan on beginning to restore SaaS services no later than the evening of Thursday July
8th US time.

July 7, 2021 - 8:00 AM EDT
As communicated in our last update, unfortunately, during the deployment of the VSA
update an issue was discovered that has blocked the release. We have not yet been able to
resolve the issue. The R&D and operations teams worked through the night and will
continue to work until we have unblocked the release. We will provide a status update at
12:00PM US EDT.

July 6, 2021 - 10:00 PM EDT
During the VSA SaaS deployment an issue was discovered that has blocked the release.
Unfortunately, the VSA SaaS rollout will not be completed in the previously communicated
timeline. We apologize for the delay and R&D and operations are continuing to work around
the clock to resolve this issue and restore service. We will be providing a status update at
8AM US EDT.

July 6, 2021 - 7:30 PM EDT
Kaseya’s VSA product has unfortunately been the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack. Due
to our teams’ fast response, we believe that this has been localized to a very small number
of on-premises customers only.
Our security, support, R&D, communications, and customer teams continue to work around
the clock in all geographies to resolve the issue and restore our customers to service.
This update provides further detail on the July 6, 2021 5:00 PM EDT and earlier updates.
The technical work for SaaS Deployment has started at 4:00 PM EDT and will
continue for the next several hours pending no issues.

13/27

We are configurating an additional layer of security to our SaaS infrastructure which
will change the underlying IP address of our VSA servers (the domain names/URL will
not change) For almost all customers, this change will be transparent. However if,
and only if, you have whitelisted your Kaseya VSA server in your firewall(s), you will
need ot update the IP whitelist. The new IP addresses can be found
at: https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/
No SaaS VSA services are on-line as of 7:30 PM. The enhanced security measures
are currently being implemented and verified for proper operation. Once operational,
we will then publish the VSA availability timeline. We will be updating the support
web page hourly at https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689
Our On-Premises patch timeline is 24 hours (or less) from the restoration of SaaS
services. We are focused on shrinking this time frame to the minimal possible – but if
there are any issues found during the spin-up of SaaS, we want to fix them before
bringing our on-premises customers up.
Continued Advisory
All on-premises VSA Servers should continue to remain offline until further instructions
from Kaseya about when it is safe to restore operations. A patch will be required to
be installed prior to restarting the VSA and a set of recommendations on how to
increase your security posture.
We have been advised by our outside experts,
that customers who experienced ransomware and receive communication from
the attackers should not click on any links – they may be weaponized.

July 6, 2021 - 5:00 PM EDT
Good progress being made. The next update will be posted by 6:00 PM.

July 6, 2021 - 12:00 PM EDT
Next Update is planned to be published July 6th between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM EDT.
Kaseya’s VSA product has unfortunately been the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack. Due
to our teams’ fast response, we believe that this has been localized to a very small number
of on-premises customers only.
Our security, support, R&D, communications, and customer teams continue to work around
the clock in all geographies to resolve the issue and restore our customers to service.
This update provides further detail on the July 5, 2021 9:30 PM EDT and earlier updates.
Our Timeline for bringing SaaS servers on-line has shifted out by two hours – it
is now July 6th between 4:00 PM EDT and 7:00 PM EDT due to configuration
change and enhanced security measures being put in place.
14/27

Our On-Premises patch timeline is 24 hours (or less) from the restoration of
SaaS services. We are focused on shrinking this time frame to the minimal
possible – but if there are any issues found during the spin-up of SaaS, we want
to fix them before bringing our on-premises customers up.
The enhanced security measures that will be brought online are:
24/7 Independent SOC for every VSA with the ability to quarantine and isolate
files and entire VSA servers.
A complementary CDN with WAF for every VSA (Including on premise that optin and wish to use it – details will be available in a KB later this afternoon).
Customers who whitelist IPs will be required to need to whitelist additional IPs.
A new KB article on the SOC, CDN, and Whitelisting details will be published
later this afternoon and linked to this KB on the Kaseya website.
Greatly reduces the attack surface of Kaseya VSA overall.
Later today we will release a customer-ready statement for you to use to
communicate to your customers on the incident and the security measures that

Incident Update – more details can be found here: Incident Overview & Technical
Details – Kaseya
To date, we are aware of fewer than 60 Kaseya customers, all of whom were using
the VSA on-premises product, who were directly compromised by this attack. While
many of these customers provide IT services to multiple other companies, we
understand the total impact thus far has been to fewer than 1,500 downstream
businesses.
We have not found evidence that any of our SaaS customers were compromised.
VSA is the only Kaseya product affected by the attack and all other IT Complete
modules are not impacted.
Continued Advisory
All on-premises VSA Servers should continue to remain offline until further instructions
from Kaseya about when it is safe to restore operations. A patch will be required to be
installed prior to restarting the VSA and a set of recommendations on how to increase
your security posture.
We have been advised by our outside experts, that customers who experienced
ransomware and receive communication from the attackers should not click
on any links – they may be weaponized.

July 5, 2021 - 9:30 PM EDT
Next Update is planned to be published July 6th between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM EDT.

Kaseya’s VSA product has unfortunately been the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack. Due
to our teams’ fast response, we believe that this has been localized to a very small number
of on-premises customers only.
Our security, support, R&D, communications, and customer teams continue to work around
the clock in all geographies to resolve the issue and restore our customers to service.
This update provides further detail on the July 5, 2021 1:00 PM EDT and earlier updates.
Incident Update
In an effort to be transparent with our customers, Kaseya is sharing the
information concerning the recent ransomware attack in an Incident Overview &
Technical Details document which is available at this link.
To date, we are aware of fewer than 60 Kaseya customers, all of whom were
using the VSA on-premises product, who were directly compromised by this
attack. While many of these customers provide IT services to multiple other
companies, we understand the total impact thus far has been to fewer than
1,500 downstream businesses. We have not found evidence that any of our
SaaS customers were compromised.
We have had no new reports filed of compromises for VSA customers since
Saturday July 3rd.
VSA is the only Kaseya product affected by the attack and all other IT Complete
modules are not impacted.
An article by Reuters covers the incident – link
Our executive committee met this afternoon at 6:30 PM EDT to reset the timeline and
process for bringing our SaaS and on-premises customers back online.
The Patch for on-premises customers has been developed and is currently
going through the testing and validation process. We expect the patch to be
available within 24 hours after our SaaS servers have been brought up.
The current estimate for bringing our SaaS servers back online is July 6th
between 2:00 PM – 5:00 PM EDT. A final go/no-go decision will be made
tomorrow morning between 8:00 AM EDT – 12:00 AM EDT. These times may
change as we go through the final testing and validation processes.
We will be releasing VSA with staged functionality to bring services back online
sooner. The first release will prevent access to functionality used by a very small
fraction of our user base, including:
Classic Ticketing
Classic Remote Control (not LiveConnect).
User Portal
Kaseya met with the FBI/CISA tonight to discuss systems and network hardening
requirements prior to service restoration for both SaaS and on-premises customers. A
set of requirements will be posted prior to service restart to give our customers time to
put these counter measures in place in anticipation of a return to service on July 6th.

A new version of the Compromise Detection Tool can be downloaded at the following
link: VSA Detection Tools.zip | Powered by Box
This tool analyzes a system (either VSA server or managed endpoint) and
determines whether any indicators of compromise (IoC) are present.
The latest version searches for the indicators of compromise, data encryption,
and the REvil ransom note. We recommend that you re-run this procedure to
better determine if the system was compromised by REvil.
Over 2,000 customers have downloaded this tool since Friday.
Continued Advisory
All on-premises VSA Servers should continue to remain offline until further instructions
from Kaseya about when it is safe to restore operations. A patch will be required to be
installed prior to restarting the VSA and a set of recommendations on how to increase
your security posture.

the clock in all geographies to resolve the issue and restore our customers to service.
This update provides further detail on the July 4, 2021 10:00AM EDT and earlier updates.
Our efforts have shifted from root cause analysis and mitigating the vulnerability to
beginning the execution of our service recovery plan. This plan will consist of the following
stages:
Communication of our phased recovery plan with SaaS customers first followed by
on-premises customers.
In the spirit of responsible disclosure, Kaseya will be publishing a summary of
the attack and what we have done to mitigate it.
Some lightly-used legacy VSA functionality will be removed as part of this
release out of an abundance of caution. A specific list of the functionality and its
impact on VSA capabilities will be outlined in the release notes.
There will be new security measures implemented including enhanced security
monitoring of our SaaS servers by FireEye and enablement of enhanced WAF
capabilities.
We have successfully completed an external Vulnerability Scan, checked our
SaaS Databases for Indicators of Compromise, and have had external security
experts review our code to ensure a successful service restart.
SaaS Restoration Timeline Updates
Our executive committee will meet on July 5th at 5:00 AM UTC (12:00 AM EDT)
to make a readiness decision on restarting SaaS within the following time
windows:
EU, UK, & APAC Data Centers: July 5 – 9:00 AM UTC – 1:00 PM UTC
(4:00 AM EDT – 8:00 AM EDT)
North American Data Centers: July 5 – 5:00 PM EDT – 10:00 PM EDT
These times/dates are subject to change and a status update will be posted on
the website by 1:00 AM UTC as to whether we are adhering to the above
schedule or not. If not, we will publish a revised schedule at that time.
For our SaaS Users:
We will bring our SaaS data centers back online on a one-by-one basis starting
with our EU, UK and APAC data centers followed by our North American data
centers.
We will be adding an additional layer of security to our SaaS infrastructure which
will change the underlying IP addresses of our VSA servers.

Hosted VSA Servers will become operational once Kaseya has determined that we
can safely restore operations. We are in the process of formulating a staged return to
service of our SaaS server farms with restricted functionality and a higher security
posture (estimated in the next 24-48 hours but that is subject to change) on a
geographic basis. More details on both the limitations, security posture changes, and
time frame will be in the next communique later today.
All on-premises VSA Servers should continue to remain offline until further instructions

Key Points on Current Status
The new Compromise Detection Tool was rolled out last night to almost 900
customers who requested the tool. Based on feedback from customers, we will be
publishing an update to the tool this morning that improves its performance and
usability. There are no changes that will require a re-run of the tool on systems
that have been scanned.
This new version of the Compromise Detection Tool will be automatically sent to
customers who received the first version. New requests can be made by sending an
email to [email protected] with the subject “Compromise Detection Tool Request”.
We will be opening up a private download site for end customers to get access to the
Compromise Detection Tool once we have ensured the security, integrity, and
trackability of the download process. More about this in the next update.
We continue to work with FireEye Mandiant IR (a leading computer incident response
firm) on the security incident. Our joint efforts have not identified any new IoCs since
yesterday and we have deployed our Compromise Detection Tool at hundreds of
customers. At this point, no “False Positives” have been reported by users. [Note: A
“False Positive” indicates that the Compromise Detection Tool incorrectly classifies a
system as impacted when it wasn’t]
We have been actively engaged with FireEye and other security assessment firms to
assess the manner and impact of the attack to ensure that our R&D organization has
properly identified and mitigated the vulnerability. We are continuing the investigation
in parallel with the remediation steps.
R&D has replicated the attack vector and the mitigation work is in progress. We
expect to complete the work in the next 24-48 hours and the testing is progressing in
parallel.

Fred Voccola, CEO of Kaseya, was interviewed regarding this incident on Good
Morning America on the ABC network on Sunday, July 4th. The interview was
significantly edited down from the full interview that Fred gave. The short message
was: “We are sure we know how it happened and we are remediating it.”
We have engaged with the FBI and DHS CISA and are working with them on an
incident-handling process for our worldwide customers impacted by the cyberattack.
The following message will be posted to the FBI website:
““If you feel your systems have been compromised as a result of the Kaseya
ransomware incident, we encourage you to employ all recommended mitigations,
follow Kaseya’s guidance to shut down your VSA servers immediately, and report your
compromise to the FBI at https://www.IC3.gov. Due to the potential scale of this
incident, we may be unable to respond to each victim individually but all information
we receive will be useful in countering this threat.”
At this time, we believe that none of our NOC customers (neither SaaS nor onpremises) were affected by the attack. We’re continuing to investigate, but no
compromised NOC customers have been found as of July 4th at 10:00 AM EDT.
Kaseya executives are directly reaching out to impacted customers to understand
their situations and what assistance is possible. If you believe that you have been
impacted, please contact [email protected] with the subject “Security Incident Report.”
There have been no new reports of compromises since our last report
yesterday. We are confident we understand the scope of the issue and are partnering
with each client to do everything possible to remediate. We believe that there is zero
related risk right now for any VSA client who is a SaaS customer or on-premises VSA
customer who has their server offline.

There has been only one new report of a compromise occurring today due to a VSA
on-premises server being left on. We are confident we understand the scope of the
issue and are partnering with each client to do everything possible to remediate. We
believe that there is zero related risk right now for any VSA client who is a SaaS
customer or on-prem VSA customer who has their server off.
We have engaged a computer incident response firm (FireEye Mandiant IR) to identify
the indicators of compromise (IoCs) to ensure that we can identify which systems and
data were accessed. We have identified a set of preliminary IoCs and have been
working with our affected customers to validate them. The availability of the
Compromise Detection Tool is based on our interactions with our outside experts.
We have been actively engaged with FireEye and other security assessment firms to
assess the manner and impact of the attack to ensure that our R&D organization has
properly identified and mitigated the vulnerability.
R&D has replicated the attack vector and is working on mitigating it. We have begun
the process of remediating the code and will include regular status updates on our
progress starting tomorrow morning. We will begin working with select customers to
field test the changes once we have completed the work and tested it thoroughly in
our environment. We will not publish a resolution timeframe until we have thoroughly
validated and tested the proposed solution.
At this time, we believe that none of our NOC customers (neither SaaS nor onpremises) were affected by the attack. We’re continuing to investigate this, but no
compromised NOC customers have been found as of 7:00 PM EDT.

Since the security of our customers is paramount, we are continuing to strongly
recommend that our on-premises customers’ VSA servers remain offline until
further notice. We will also keep our SaaS servers offline until further notice.
We have been advised by our outside experts, that customers who experienced
ransomware and receive communication from the attackers should not click on
any links — they may be weaponized.
We have engaged with the FBI and are working with them on an incident handling
process for our worldwide customers impacted by the cyberattack. We will be
publishing a list of contacts later today.
Kaseya executives are directly reaching out to impacted customers to understand

impacted should contact [email protected] with the subject “Security Incident Report.”
We continue to engage with industry experts to assess the manner and impact of the
attack and ensure that our R&D organization has properly identified and mitigated the
vulnerability.
R&D has replicated the attack vector and is working on mitigating it. We will not
publish a resolution timeframe until we have thoroughly validated and tested the
proposed solution. We appreciate our customers’ patience.
We have engaged a computer forensics firm to identify the indicators of compromise
(IOCs) to ensure that we can identify which systems and data were accessed.
R&D is working on a self-assessment tool for our customers, to enable them to
definitively determine whether they were affected. This will be published as part of the
patch for on-premises customers.
At this time, we believe that none of our NOC customers (neither SaaS nor on-premises)
were affected by the attack. We’re continuing to investigate this.
ALL ON-PREMISES VSA SERVERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REMAIN OFFLINE
UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM KASEYA ABOUT WHEN IT IS SAFE TO
RESTORE OPERATIONS. A PATCH WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE INSTALLED
PRIOR TO RESTARTING THE VSA.
SAAS & HOSTED VSA SERVERS WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ONCE KASEYA
HAS DETERMINED THAT WE CAN SAFELY RESTORE OPERATIONS.

on any links – they may be weaponized.
Kaseya has been working around the clock to resolve this issue from a security
assessment, client support, progress update, technical resolution, and return to operational
status standpoint.
A comprehensive update is in progress and will be published later this morning (EDT).
This communication will include prescriptive information on:
The external authorities (FBI, Incident Response Experts) that we have engaged and
how we are leveraging them for assistance;
How our customers can engage Kaseya for assistance and what we can do to help;
How to determine whether customers have been compromised;
Status updates from R&D on the progress of the patch for on-premises users;
The plan to bring our SaaS and on-premises customers back online;
A detailed description of the Security Incident process and current status;
A schedule for communications updates;
Other important information about the recovery process.
Ongoing updates will be provided every 3-4 hours or more often based on breaking details.
1. ALL ON-PREMISEs VSA SERVERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REMAIN OFFLINE
UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM KASEYA.
2. SAAS & HOSTED VSA SERVERS WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ONCE KASEYA
HAS DETERMINED THAT WE CAN SAFELY RESTORE OPERATIONS.

July 2, 2021 - 10:00 PM EDT
Beginning around mid-day (EDT/US) on Friday July 2, 2021, Kaseya’s Incident Response
team learned of a potential security incident involving our VSA software.
We took swift actions to protect our customers:
Immediately shut down our SaaS servers as a precautionary measure, even though
we had not received any reports of compromise from any SaaS or hosted customers;
Immediately notified our on-premises customers via email, in-product notices, and
phone to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from being compromised.

26/27

We then followed our established incident response process to determine the scope of the
incident and the extent that our customers were affected.
We engaged our internal incident response team and leading industry experts in
forensic investigations to help us determine the root cause of the issue;
We notified law enforcement and government cybersecurity agencies, including the
FBI and CISA.
While our early indicators suggested that only a very small number of on-premises
customers were affected, we took a conservative approach in shutting down the SaaS
servers to ensure we protected our more than 36,000 customers to the best of our ability.
We have received positive feedback from our customers on our rapid and proactive
response.
While our investigation is ongoing, to date we believe that:
Our SaaS customers were never at-risk. We expect to restore service to those
customers once we have confirmed that they are not at risk, which we expect will be
within the next 24 hours;
Only a very small percentage of our customers were affected – currently estimated at
fewer than 40 worldwide.
We believe that we have identified the source of the vulnerability and are preparing a patch
to mitigate it for our on-premises customers that will be tested thoroughly. We will release
that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running.
I am proud to report that our team had a plan in place to jump into action and executed that
plan perfectly today. We’ve heard from the vast majority of our customers that they
experienced no issues at all, and I am grateful to our internal teams, outside experts, and
industry partners who worked alongside of us to quickly bring this to a successful outcome.
Today’s actions are a testament to Kaseya’s unwavering commitment to put our customers
first and provide the highest level of support for our products.
Fred Voccola, CEO
Kaseya
