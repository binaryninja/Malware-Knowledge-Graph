3. Protect against ransomware and extortion: Human-operated ransomware attacks
can be catastrophic to business operations and are difficult to clean up, requiring
complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Follow our ransomware
specific technical guidance to help prepare for an attack, limit the scope of damage,
and remove additional risks: Human-operated ransomware

Updated malware details and Microsoft security product detections
For customers utilizing Microsoft security products, we continue to build and release
protections for the evolving threats we have identified impacting organizations with ties to
Ukraine. As noted in the published analysis above, there are multiple actors using a variety
of tools and techniques in this dynamic threat landscape. Some of these threats are
assessed to be more closely tied to nation-state interests, while others seem to be more
opportunistically attempting to take advantage of events surrounding the conflict. We have
observed attacks reusing components of known malware that are frequently covered by
existing detections, while others have used customized malware for which Microsoft has built
new comprehensive protections.

Destructive wiper attacks
Beginning with WhisperGate, Microsoft continues to observe destructive malware attacks
impacting organizations in Ukraine. These attacks are often the final stage to intrusions that,
in some cases, may have predated the current military actions in Ukraine. We assess that
the intended objective of these attacks is the disruption, degradation, and destruction of
targeted resources. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) assesses that
organizations within Ukraine continue to be at high-risk for destructive operations for the
foreseeable future.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides detections for the wiper attacks in build
version 1.363.797.0 or newer. Customers utilizing automatic updates do not need to take
additional action. Enterprise customers managing updates should select the detection
build 1.363.797.0 or newer and deploy it across their environments.
The following is a list of high-level activities and the related malware that Microsoft has
identified and is protecting customers against:
WhisperGate
Limited-scope destructive malware attack on January 13, 2022 impacting dozens of systems
spanning multiple government, non-profit, and information technology organizations, all
based in Ukraine. MSTIC tracks the actor responsible for this attack as DEV-0586 and has
not linked it to a previously known activity group. We assess that DEV-0586 continues to be
active in Ukraine but is also targeting other countries within the region.

3/9

FoxBlade and SonicVote
Destructive malware attack originally discovered on February 23, 2022 impacting hundreds
of systems spanning multiple government, information technology, financial sector, and
energy organizations predominately located in or with nexus to Ukraine. MSTIC has
attributed events associated with FoxBlade with medium confidence to IRIDIUM (previously
tracked as DEV-0665). Microsoft assesses there will be a continued risk for destructive
activity from this group, as we have observed follow-on intrusions since February 23
involving these malicious capabilities. Microsoft is tracking the following malware families
related to this activity:
FoxBlade (aka HermeticWiper / HermeticWizard)
SonicVote (aka HermeticRansom)

IRIDIUM has also periodically leveraged a renamed version of the SysInternals utility sdelete
(renamed by IRIDIUM to cdel.exe) to perform targeted secure deletion of areas of the file
system using the following command-line pattern:
c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /C C:\Windows\cdel.exe -accepteula -r -s -q
c:\Users & C:\Windows\cdel.exe -accepteula -r -s -q c:\ProgramData

Lasainraw (aka IsaacWiper)
Limited destructive malware attack originally identified by ESET on February 25, 2022.
Microsoft continues to investigate this incident and has not currently linked it to attributed
threat actors.
DesertBlade
Limited destructive malware attack in early March 2022 impacting a single Ukrainian entity.
Similar to other destructive capabilities, DesertBlade, which is implemented in Golang, was
deployed via hijacked Group Policy Objects (GPOs). DesertBlade is responsible for
iteratively overwriting and then deleting overwritten files on all accessible drives (sparing the
system if it is a domain controller). Due to the nature of the investigation and partnerships
involved, Microsoft is currently not able to share samples of DesertBlade. However, we can
share the following hashes as examples of the DesertBlade family:
a71c8306b6b8a89c18dea3b1490037593737d59b023000f24da94e3275600b59
4ca63406ff189301ccbb54daa6e2da4bc5d03ffc1a8a9756717d95d26abc3906
The following Yara rule can be used to detect DesertBlade using these hashes:
rule DesertBlade

}

FiberLake (aka DoubleZero)
On March 22, 2022 CERT-UA published details on a .NET capability being used in
destructive attacks tracked by Microsoft as FiberLake (aka DoubleZero). Microsoft has
observed FiberLake being used in attacks targeting Ukraine broadcast/media organizations.
Microsoft is continuing to investigate this incident and has not currently linked it to known
threat activity.
CaddyWiper and AprilAxe (aka ARGUEPATCH)
CaddyWiper was first discovered by ESET on March 14, 2022 and has been observed by
Microsoft impacting a limited number of organizations in targeted attacks. CaddyWiper is a
destructive capability that results in file and drive overwriting, rendering compromised
systems unbootable. On April 1, 2022, Microsoft identified a new variant that involved a
multi-stage loading process.
In this new variant, the threat actor leveraged a backdoored IDA debugger server
executable, which Microsoft has named AprilAxe. AprilAxe is designed to de-obfuscate and
load malicious code from disk. In all observed intrusions, the loader is paired with a variant of
CaddyWiper. Microsoft has observed multiple impacted organizations across government,
natural resources, banking, and energy organizations. ESET published technical details on
this new version of CaddyWiper/ARGUEPATCH. In line with ESET, MSTIC also attributes the
intrusion activity and capabilities to IRIDIUM.
Industroyer.B (aka Industroyer2)
5/9

On April 8, 2022, Microsoft observed AprilAxe and CaddyWiper being staged to target an
energy organization in Ukraine. During this intrusion, the actors also deployed a malicious
ICS/SCADA utility named Industroyer 2, which is capable of interacting with industrial control
systems. CERT-UA and ESET published additional technical details on this capability. In line
with ESET, MSTIC attributes this intrusion activity and capability to IRIDIUM.
Related protections
Customers are encouraged to turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample
submission in Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and
machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats. As we continue to
investigate these attacks and uncover new data, we will add or update protections.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers should look for
the following family names for activity related to the wiper attacks:
WhisperGate
FoxBlade
Lasainraw
SonicVote
CaddyWiper
AprilAxe
FiberLake
Industroyer
DesertBlade
The observed wiper attacks can be further limited through additional hardening
configurations. When enabled, these features bring more resilience to customer defenses in
addition to defending against these specific wiper attacks:
Tamper protection prevents common techniques observed to disable security
protections on endpoints.
Controlled folder access allows only trusted apps to access protected folders. It is
typically effective at blocking these wiper attacks.
Unattributed threat activity
As part of continued efforts by the MSTIC and Microsoft 365 Defender Research teams to
identify threat activity and protect organizations, we continue to discover unattributed threat
activity. We will continue to analyze activity and build detections for these threats as they are
identified.

6/9

As with any observed nation-state actor activity, where possible, Microsoft directly and
proactively notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised, providing them with
information they need to help guide their investigations. MSTIC is also actively working with
members of the global security community and other strategic partners to share information
that can help address this evolving threat through multiple channels. Microsoft uses DEV#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing
cluster of threat activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we
reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity.
Common secondary intrusion behaviors
Many of the observed attacks have made use of known malware and intrusion tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
using these common alerts:
Suspicious remote activity
Suspicious access to LSASS service
Microsoft Defender Antivirus tampering
Suspicious remote activity
Customers who see incidents that tie one or more of these indicators together should
prioritize investigation of the affected devices.
Opportunistic phishing campaigns
Taking advantage of interest in the geopolitical conflict, attackers have been observed using
tailored domains in phishing attacks. Microsoft SmartScreen and the network protection
feature in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provide protections for customers lured to these
domains, including, but not limited to, the following:
help-for-ukraine[.]eu
tokenukraine[.]com
ukrainesolidarity[.]org
ukraine-solidarity[.]com
saveukraine[.]today
supportukraine[.]today
Hunting for related attacks
Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers can hunt for related
activity through the queries below:
Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel offers detection and threat hunting analytics for techniques observed in
relation to these threats. These analytics can be found in the Microsoft Sentinel portal or via
the Microsoft Sentinel GitHub.
Crash dump disabled on host
This query looks for registry keys being set on a host in order to prevent crash dumps being
created.
https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/blob/master/Hunting%20Queries/SecurityEvent/Crashdumpdisabledonhost.yaml
New EXE deployed via Default Domain or Default Domain Controller Policies
This query looks for executables executed on host that appear to have been deployed via
the Default Domain Policy or the Default Domain Controller Policy. These policies are not
typically used for distributing executables.
https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/blob/master/Detections/SecurityEvent/NewEXEdeployedviaDefaultDomainorDefault
DomainControllerPolicies.yaml
Potential renamed Sdelete usage
This query looks for command line parameters associated with recursive use of Sdelete
against the C drive where the originating process isn’t named sdelete.exe.
https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Detections/SecurityEvent/Potentialrenamedsdeleteusage.yaml
Sdelete deployed via GPO
This query looks for Sdelete being deployed via GPO and run recursively on a host.

DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ "mshta.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_all (".dll", "Roaming")
| where ProcessCommandLine contains @"Roaming\j"
| extend DLLName = extract(@"[jJ][a-z]{1,12}\.dll", 0, ProcessCommandLine)

Surface suspicious Scheduled Task activity
Use this query to look for Scheduled Tasks that may relate to actor activity.
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_all ("schtasks.exe", "create", "wscript",
"e:vbscript", ".wav")

Potential renamed sdelete usage
Use this query to look for command line parameters associated with the use of a renamed
Sysinternals sdelete tool to delete multiple files on the C drive as part of destructive attacks
on a host.
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName !~ "sdelete.exe"
and InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_all ("-accepteula", "-r", "-s", "-q", "c:/")
and InitiatingProcessCommandLine !has ("sdelete")

Microsoft continues to investigate these attacks and improve protections as new data is
analyzed. In addition, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender have a range of
existing queries for the detection of common techniques, such as lateral movement and
privilege escalation. We recommend customers use these queries to identify common
attacker techniques being used in these attacks.
We continue to monitor activity and will update this page with more information as the
situation develops.
