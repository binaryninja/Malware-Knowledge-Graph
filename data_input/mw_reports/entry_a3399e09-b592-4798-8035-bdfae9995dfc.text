This report is part one of AdvIntel’s new series on the ALPHV (aka BlackCat) ransomware
group. In the upcoming part two, AdvIntel will hold an analytical lens on BlackCat’s
organizational, recruitment, and operations process. This part introduces the context and

1/15

offers a deep dive into the group’s technical capabilities which could herald a new breed of
threat actors entering the cybercriminal ecosystem.

The intelligence analysis for this case originates in AdvIntel's direct adversarial
visibility into the BlackCat group and is based on primary source intelligence and not
tertiary evidence.

ALPHV: An Introduction

ALPHV (more commonly known as BlackCat), is a ransomware group known for its highlycustomizable feature set and Rust-written malware locker, allowing for attacks on a wide
range of corporate environments and the successful execution of a number of high-profile
attacks, including the Italian luxury brand Monclerand the aviation company Swissport.

BlackCat’s ransomware includes many advanced technical features which set it apart from
most ransomware operations—these include the malware being entirely command-line
driven, human-operated and adaptable, as well as its ability to use different encryption
routines, spread between devices, and kill hypervisors, even wiping their snapshots to
prevent recovery.

In short, BlackCat’s unique strength seems to be in its adaptability, or willingness to
change to fit its own current needs. So what enables BlackCat to set themselves apart
from the rest?

2/15

Starting from Square One

It has long been speculated that unlike other groups of its kind, BlackCat not only uses an
uncommon Rust-based malware (as opposed to the more commonly used C-based
variants), but also tend to avoid utilizing any of the same tools common in ransomware
operations (such as Cobalt Strike, exploitations of Atera, Metasploit, etc).

This is a direct address to possibly the most pressing issue facing today’s ransomware
community—a fatigue of attack methodologies that has already contributed to the
dissolution of established threat groups.

For years, only a few tools were being weaponized by cybercriminals to perform network
penetration, with Cobalt Strikebeing the most common. This created an entire generation of
criminal pentesters who were working for ransomware groups and trapped within their own
narrow toolboxes. This in turn allowed cyber-defense groups to focus on Cobalt Strike IOCs
as a surefire warning sign, increasing the criminals’ chance of being spotted and ultimately
lowering their attack persistences. Moreover, Cobalt Strike is a legitimate pentesting tool, not
originally conceived as a malware, which makes the efficiency of cyber defenses addressing
CS-weaponized attacks even more effective—because the software is, in a sense, designed
to be beaten.

3/15

A short positive review of BlackCat from the RAMP’s forum admin, a known ransomware
developer with over a decade of cybercriminal experience.

As a result, ransomware collectives have been actively plotting an escape from the tunnelvision of the toolbox mindset. The now-defunct Conti, for instance, prepared a list of over
a hundred different network penetration and offensive alternatives, which included
both legitimate tools as well as underground malware. But these initiatives never
achieved actual execution.

BlackCat’s case diverges from the mainstream narrative, however, as the group has
established an operation set around their own self-written offensive scripts. By creating
entirely new tools to execute their operations, BlackCat has not only found what seems like
an effective way to circumvent existing defense strategies, but also to ensure their own
longevity—by changing along with the times. This sets BlackCat leagues ahead of its
competitors.

BlackCat’s Edge - Ransomware Binary Analysis: Tech Dive

4/15

AdvIntel has observed BlackCat’s ransomware binary to have quite a few different versions,
different flavors for the variety of operating system architecture it may come up against,
including ESXI. Because of this range in ransomware binaries, many opportunities have
been provided for our team to dissect AlphV’s internal operations due to its use of the Rust
programming language.
AdvIntel has found the BlackCat deployment operation to involve one(1) direct execution
using domain and enterprise administrator hard-coded credentials.
Additionally, the criminals launched the encryption operation via the domain controller global
policy update execution from SYSVOL directory and netlogon with scheduled tasks, followed
with the following arguments from the primary domain controller (PDC):
·
·

/c \\DOMAIN.LOCAL \netlogon\locker.exe --access-token CODE
gpupdate /force

Windows x64 Version
BlackCat’s ransomware binary is written in Rust by mature and experienced coders, with
each version of Windows or Linux library leveraging a usual combination of private and
public cryptography with Salsa20/AES and RSA. The malware coder has left the compiler
path as "C:\Users\runneradmin" for the Windows library. Interestingly, the binary has its own
full user graphical interface launched via the access token, obtained by the affiliate from their
ransomware panel.
Some of the notable malware features include self-propagation enumerating services
and shares, PsExec for network-wide execution ("arp -a'' enumeration) alongside the
leveraging of extensively safe boot functionality while modifying boot loader, establishing
itself as 'service' in safeboot to enable it to bypass certain antivirus and endpoint detection
and response products. The ransomware binary also clears logs, removes volume
shadow copies and cleans up the Recycle Bin.
The malware contains functionality to pass domain credentials to the "net use" function to
allow system-wide access from a single machine with UAC bypass, leveraging the process
environment block (PEB) traversal technique to obtain API calls, as seen in the following:

win7_plus=true
token_is_admin=
token_is_domain_admin=
masquerade_peb
Uac_bypass::
escalate=success
escalate=failure

5/15

Additionally, the malware leverages the usual Restart Manager API for accessing certain
files, as well as the discovery of "hidden partitions".

Linux Debian x64 ESXI Version

The ESXI version of the malware contains the logic to encrypt ESXI volumes in
/vmfs/volumes as well as renovating all virtual machines snapshots via the command line, as
seen in the following:
esxi/bin/esxclilog | | esxcli --formatter=csv --formatparam=fields=="WorldID,DisplayName" vm process list | awk -F "\"*,\"*"
'{system("esxcli vm process kill --type=force --world-id="$1)}'for i in `vim-cmd
vmsvc/getallvms| awk '{print$1}'`;do vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall $i & done

The Mirror Worlds of Cybercriminals

BlackCat update announcement post on the criminal forum RAMP.

What’s important to note is that BlackCat’s foundation for their clean start is more about the
group’s mindset, rather than its toolkit. From the get-go, BlackCat has been searching for
outside-the-box solutions to ransomware’s biggest obstacles, both operationally and
organizationally.

6/15

For years now, extortionist groups have mainly adhered to the RaaS, or Ransomware-as-aService model, enabling their affiliates to rent already-developed ransomware tools to
independently execute their attacks. Apart from Conti, Cl0p, and DoppelPaymer, most
ransomware collectives have tended to be loosely organized, with very little internal structure
holding them together—the cybercriminal ecosystem, due to the illegal nature of its
existence, is inherently unstable and chaotic, with groups disbanding and rebranding
constantly within the trade’s very young lifespan.

This constant, kinetic movement is strangely reminiscent of the high attrition rate of startup
companies—the cybercriminal community, specifically the ransomware community, can
sometimes be a black mirror of real-world crime syndicates or even legitimate
businesses:the high turnover in startup companies shows an above-ground parallel to the
movement of threat actors in and out of ransomware collectives because both industries tend
to suffer from similar issues: this can includelack of regulation, high competition, “sniping” of
talented members, structural issues, and general lack of dedication to maintaining growth
and structure.

BlackCat & REvil: Avoiding the Mistakes of the Past

Conversely, the RaaS model is both named for and reflective of the Software-as-aService model, which is used nigh-universally across the enterprise software industry.
Initially, the SaaS model of “on-demand software” was focused on managing and hosting
third-party software from independent vendors. However, over time, SaaSvendors began to
develop their own proprietary software, cutting out the middle-man in the arrangement.

BlackCat has done the same with its operational model. The group’s Admin (according to
AdvIntel investigation) is a former member of REvil, which was dismantled after FSB raids in
early 2022. However, when it came time to rebrand, instead of merely recreating REvil’s
payload, BlackCat instead decided to create their own.

The group seems to be avoiding a mere retread of REvil’s footsteps, and for good reason—
as earlier stated, ransomware collectives based around “on-demand software” with no
personal innovation model have a tendency to explode into infamy before quickly burning

7/15

out. For instance, Avaddon, Maze, Egregor, and REvil, who by all accounts were already
on the verge of death by the time its members were arrested.

AdvIntel's visibility into BlackCat’s panel—a mimic of REvil’s previous panel.

BlackCat’s decision to “start from scratch”, writing new, highly-configurable malware
in a lesser-utilized programming language reflects a parallel demand within RaaS to
its SaaS namesake: the demand for new, specialized tools that would allow BlackCat
to corner the ransomware market at a time when development is desperately needed
in order for threat groups to survive.

On Trend: Cornering the Black Market

Moreover, SaaS’s more recent developments have recently seen another notable trend: the
shift from horizontal SaaS, or software that applies broadly to a wide variety of industries, to
vertical SaaS, which targets specific industry niches and standards.

RaaS’s movement as a model within the threat landscape indicates that its next steps are
similar: the most innovative threat groups, BlackCat included, seem to be honing in, with a
greater emphasis in their malware’s exclusivity, customization features, and ability to target
specific entities. As of right now, BlackCat’s exclusive, highly-configurable Rust-based locker
seems unprecedented, with government agencies scrambling to classify IOCs for the group
while their target count continues to rise.
8/15

The current threat landscape is now undergoing changes that have only become more
pronounced in recent weeks, as larger and more established groups such as Conti have
quickly disintegrated, its previous affiliates surreptitiously forming new groups, or
joining existing ones.

The new threat groups that result from this dispersion have the benefit of utilizing their new
members’ advanced capabilities as former affiliates of larger and more established
ransomware collectives. The novel groups have emerged from members who yield extremely
niche operational skillsets, in turn making the groups’ functionalities increasingly specialized.
If access brokerage trends further towards the specific targeting of organizations and
industries, group specialization may even begin to influence what tools are used and
developed by different groups, as we are currently seeing with the breakneck
evolution of the BazarCall attack vector.

Conclusions—RaaS: Resiliency-as-a-Service

Despite its innovations to the model, BlackCat, like its contemporaries, still falls under the
category of a Ransomware-as-a-Service group. RaaS didn’t take its title from SaaS merely
as a joke; both models function “on-demand”—or as their names indicate, “as-a-Service”. As
the criminal ecosystem continues to evolve at an alarming pace, BlackCat’s methodologies
may soon become representative of the scene as demand for specificity increases—
with broader threat groups who fail to adapt left to become obsolete.

Recommendations & Mitigations [ALPHV/BlackCat]
The FBI has recently released an official profile on BlackCat ransomware. The
government agency recommends that victims of BlackCat do not pay requested ransoms
if possible, and to report all BlackCat-related incidents to the agency itself.

10/15

AdvIntel & the FBI both support the following mitigations and prevention recommendations
for ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware:
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new
or unrecognized user accounts.
Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline.
Ensure copies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the
system where the data resides.
Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually
review operating system defined or recognized scheduled tasks for unrecognized
“actions” (for example: review the steps each scheduled task is expected to perform).
Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.
Implement network segmentation.
Require administrator credentials to install software.
Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or
proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g.,
hard drive, storage device, the cloud).
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as
updates/patches are released.
Use multifactor authentication where possible.
Regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts, and avoid reusing
passwords for different accounts.
Implement the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.
Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor
remote access/RDP logs.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls
with least privilege in mind.
Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.
Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing
and using a virtual private network (VPN).
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.

11/15

Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
