Initially, Qakbot spreads using malicious email attachments, drive-by-download attacks, or
other forms of social engineering. The recent variants of Qakbot employ OneNote, Windows
Script File (WSF), and HTML smuggling to disseminate malware as part of a new campaign.
These campaigns showcase the adaptability and sophistication of Qakbot and the constant
evolution of malware as a menace to cybersecurity. This article will explore Qakbot’s tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and detection of Qakbot behaviour by querying and
monitoring the operating system using SQL-like syntax with the help of osquery.

Qakbot’s Initial Infection
The chart below gives an overview of the campaigns carried out by threat actors over time to
distribute Qakbot malware, and further we will delve into the details of these campaigns.

Windows Script File (WSF) Campaign
The Qakbot threat actors are distributing an archive file containing .wsf files via spam mail as
part of their campaign. When user attempts to open the .wsf file, the embedded JavaScript
code will launch wscript which in turn downloads the Qakbot DLL.
The following query can be used to detect the launching of a WSF file.
SELECT
name,
cmdline,
path,
pid,
parent
FROM processes
WHERE cmdline LIKE '%.wsf%'
AND LOWER(name) IN ('wscript.exe','cscript.exe');

NOTE: Further analysis is required to determine whether the WSF file exhibits any malicious
behavior.

OneNote Campaign
Following Microsoft’s decision to block macros, threat actors behind Qakbot resorted to email
thread hijacking using a malicious OneNote document for wide-scale distribution by
embedding scripts like JSE, CHM, HTA, MSF & BAT in the attachment.
The attacker entices the victim to click on a button labeled as “Decrypt and View Message”
or “Double Click to View File” within an attachment. However, the concealed script
executes and retrieves a malicious DLL file from a hardcoded URL. For more information
refer to our blog on OneNote campaign.

);

HTML Smuggling Campaign
Based on our observation, Qakbot malware is also being distributed via emails with HTML
attachments containing malicious JavaScript code in HTML5 attributes. Upon opening the
HTML file, the JavaScript code gets executed within the browser dropping an ISO image file.
After user clicks on the shortcut file from the mounted drive, the LNK file initiates the
execution of hidden Windows 7 calculator and side-loading of Qakbot DLL.

Using osquery, the calculator loading DLLs from unusual file paths can be detected.

SELECT
datetime,
source,
provider_name,
computer_name,
eventid,
json_extract(data,'$.EventData.Image') as process_name,
json_extract(data,'$.EventData.ProcessId') as process_pid,
json_extract(data,'$.EventData.ImageLoaded') as image_loaded
FROM windows_events
WHERE eventid = '7'
AND process_name LIKE '%calc.exe'
AND
(
image_loaded NOT LIKE 'C:WindowsSystem32%'
OR image_loaded NOT LIKE 'C:WindowsSysWOW64%'
);

Qakbot’s Behaviour in Later Stages
Once the Qakbot DLL was loaded into the targeted machine, the following behaviors were
observed.
Qakbot establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task that registers the Qakbot DLL
to execute with elevated privileges. This is achieved by creating a SYSTEM user account
which is used to perform the task.
"schtasks.exe" /Create /RU "NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM" /tn {RandomTaskName} /tr
"regsvr32.exe -s "C:UsersREDACTED{QakbotDLL}"" /SC ONCE /Z /ST {Time} /ET
{Time}

The following query can be utilized to detect scheduled tasks that create a system user and
registers a DLL.
SELECT
*
FROM scheduled_tasks
WHERE
(
action LIKE '%/create%'
AND action LIKE '%SYSTEM%'
AND action LIKE '%regsvr32%'
AND action LIKE '%-s%'
);

Qakbot then attempts to inject code into a preselected list of processes to evade detection
and target LSASS through an injected process to gain credentials.

The Qakbot-injected processes accessing lsass.exe for credentials can be detected using
the query below.
SELECT
p1.name as process_name,
p1.pid as process_pid,
p1.cmdline as process_cmdline,
p2.name as parent_process_name,
p2.pid as parent_process_pid,
p2.cmdline as parent_process_cmdline
FROM processes p1, processes p2
ON p2.pid = p1.parent
AND LOWER(parent_process_name) IN
('wermgr.exe','onedrivesetup.exe','msra.exe','dxdiag.exe','xwizard.exe','atbroker.exe
','mobsync.exe','certenrollctrl.exe','explorer.exe')
AND LOWER(process_name) = 'lsass.exe';

Qakbot conducts a system discovery process to gather information about the systeminfo,
ipconfig, nslookup and arp on the targeted machine, allowing the adversary to carry out
lateral movement activities.
Below query can be used to detect Qakbot injected process executing system discovery
commands.

7/9

SELECT name,
pid,
path,
cmdline,
parent
FROM processes
WHERE LOWER(name) IN
('wermgr.exe','onedrivesetup.exe','msra.exe','dxdiag.exe','xwizard.exe','atbroker.exe
','mobsync.exe','certenrollctrl.exe','explorer.exe')
AND
(
cmdline LIKE '%whoami%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%arp%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%ipconfig%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%net view%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%nslookup%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%nltest%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%net share%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%netstat%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%net localgroup%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%qwinsta%'
);

Note: All the queries were tested on the Osquery version 5.6.0 & above.
Qakbot employs multiple threads to carry out its activities. One such thread involves
gathering information about the compromised device and exfiltrating data to its Command
and Control (C2) server.
These queries can be tested in a controlled, sandbox environment on below samples
