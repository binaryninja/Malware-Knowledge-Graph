Alert (AA21-076A)

Summary
This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®)
framework, Version 8. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have observed
continued targeting through spearphishing campaigns using TrickBot malware in North America. A sophisticated group of
cybercrime actors is luring victims, via phishing emails, with a traffic infringement phishing scheme to download TrickBot.
TrickBot—first identified in 2016—is a Trojan developed and operated by a sophisticated group of cybercrime actors.
Originally designed as a banking Trojan to steal financial data, TrickBot has evolved into highly modular, multi-stage malware
that provides its operators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities.
To secure against TrickBot, CISA and FBI recommend implementing the mitigation measures described in this Joint
Cybersecurity Advisory, which include blocking suspicious Internet Protocol addresses, using antivirus software, and
providing social engineering and phishing training to employees.

Technical Details
TrickBot is an advanced Trojan that malicious actors spread primarily by spearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that
contain malicious attachments or links, which—if enabled—execute malware (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment
[T1566.001], Phishing: Spearphishing Link [T1566.002]). CISA and FBI are aware of recent attacks that use phishing emails,
claiming to contain proof of a traffic violation, to steal sensitive information. The phishing emails contain links that redirect to a
website hosted on a compromised server that prompts the victim to click on photo proof of their traffic violation. (User
Execution: Malicious Link [T1204.001], User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002]). In clicking the photo, the victim
unknowingly downloads a malicious JavaScript file that, when opened, automatically communicates with the malicious
actor’s command and control (C2) server to download TrickBot to the victim’s system (Command and Scripting Interpreter:
JavaScript [T1059.007]).
Attackers can use TrickBot to:
Drop other malware, such as Ryuk and Conti ransomware, or
TrickBot uses person-in-the-browser attacks to steal information, such as login credentials (Man in the Browser [T1185]).
Additionally, some of TrickBot’s modules spread the malware laterally across a network by abusing the Server Message
Block (SMB) Protocol. TrickBot operators have a toolset capable of spanning the entirety of the MITRE ATT&CK framework,
from actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting (Reconnaissance [TA0043]), to trying to
manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data (Impact [TA0040]).
TrickBot is capable of data exfiltration over a hardcoded C2 server, cryptomining, and host enumeration (e.g.,
reconnaissance of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or Basic Input/Output System [UEFI/BIOS] firmware) (Exfiltration
Over C2 Channel [T1041], Resource Hijacking [T1496], System Information Discovery.[2] For host enumeration, operators
deliver TrickBot in modules containing a configuration file with specific tasks.
Figure 1 lays out TrickBot’s use of enterprise techniques.

Mitigations
CISA and FBI recommend that network defenders—in federal, state, local, tribal, territorial governments, and the private
sector—consider applying the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes prior to implementation to avoid negative
impacts.

6/7

Provide social engineering and phishing training to employees.
Consider drafting or updating a policy addressing suspicious emails that specifies users must report all suspicious
emails to the security and/or IT departments.
Mark external emails with a banner denoting the email is from an external source to assist users in detecting spoofed
emails.
Implement Group Policy Object and firewall rules.
Implement an antivirus program and a formalized patch management process.
Implement filters at the email gateway and block suspicious IP addresses at the firewall.
Adhere to the principle of least privilege.
Implement a Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance validation system.
Segment and segregate networks and functions.
Limit unnecessary lateral communications between network hoses, segments, and devices.
Consider using application allowlisting technology on all assets to ensure that only authorized software executes, and
all unauthorized software is blocked from executing on assets. Ensure that such technology only allows authorized,
digitally signed scripts to run on a system.
Enforce multi-factor authentication.
Enable a firewall on agency workstations configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Implement an Intrusion Detection System, if not already used, to detect C2 activity and other potentially malicious
network activity
Monitor web traffic. Restrict user access to suspicious or risky sites.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate access control lists.
Disable the use of SMBv1 across the network and require at least SMBv2 to harden systems against network
propagation modules used by TrickBot.
Visit the MITRE ATT&CK Techniques pages (linked in table 1 above) for additional mitigation and detection strategies.
See CISA’s Alert on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more information on
addressing potential incidents and applying best practice incident response procedures.
For additional information on malware incident prevention and handling, see the National Institute of Standards and
Technology Special Publication 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops.
