ESET researchers uncover a new APT group that has been stealing sensitive documents from several
governments in Eastern Europe and the Balkans since 2011
Rare is the APT group that goes largely undetected for nine years, but XDSpy is just that; a previously
undocumented espionage group that has been active since 2011. It has attracted very little public attention,
with the exception of an advisory from the Belarusian CERT in February 2020. In the interim, the group has
compromised many government agencies and private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

1/12

This blogpost is a summary, with updated information about the compromise vectors and Indicators of
Compromise, of research that we’ve presented at the Virus Bulletin 2020 conference (see the full paper
and the presentation).

Targets
Targets of the XDSpy group are located in Eastern Europe and the Balkans and are primarily government
entities, including militaries and Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and private companies. Figure 1 shows the
location of known victims according to ESET telemetry.

Attribution
After careful research, we were not able to link XDSpy to any publicly known APT group:
We did not find any code similarity with other malware families.
We did not observe any overlap in the network infrastructure.

2/12

We are not aware of another APT group targeting these specific countries and verticals.
Moreover, the group has been active for more than nine years. So, had such an overlap existed, we believe
that it would have been noticed, and the group uncovered, a long time ago.
We believe that the developers might be working in the UTC+2 or UTC+3 time zone, which is also the time
zone of most of the targets. We also noticed they were only working from Monday to Friday, suggesting a
professional activity.

Compromise vectors
XDSpy operators mainly seem to use spearphishing emails in order to compromise their targets. In fact,
this is the only compromise vector that we have observed. However, the emails tend to vary a bit: some
contain an attachment while others contain a link to a malicious file. The first layer of the malicious file or
attachment is generally a ZIP or RAR archive.
Figure 2 is an example of an XDSpy spearphishing email sent in February 2020.

Figure 2. Spearphishing email sent by XDSpy’s operators in February 2020

Roughly translated, the body of the email says:
Good afternoon!
I am sending you a copy of the letter and photo materials based on the results of the work. Click on the link
to download: photo materials_11.02.2020.zip
We are waiting for an answer until the end of the working day.
The link points to a ZIP archive that contains an LNK file, without any decoy document. When the victim
double-clicks on it, the LNK downloads an additional script that installs XDDown, the main malware
component.
After our paper was submitted to Virus Bulletin, we continued to track the group and, after a pause
between March and June 2020, they came back. At the end of June 2020, the operators stepped up their
game by using a vulnerability in Internet Explorer, CVE-2020-0968, which had been patched in April 2020.
Instead of delivering an archive with a LNK file, the C&C server was delivering an RTF file that, once
opened, downloaded an HTML file exploiting the aforementioned vulnerability.
CVE-2020-0968 is part of a set of similar vulnerabilities in the IE legacy JavaScript engine disclosed in the
last two years. At the time it was exploited by XDSpy, no proof-of-concept and very little information about
this specific vulnerability was available online. We think that XDSpy either bought this exploit from a broker
or developed a 1-day exploit themselves by looking at previous exploits for inspiration.

3/12

It is interesting to note that this exploit bears similarities with exploits previously used in DarkHotel
campaigns, as shown in Figure 3. It is also almost identical to the exploit used in Operation Domino in
September 2020, which was uploaded to VirusTotal from Belarus.
Given that we don’t believe XDSpy is linked to DarkHotel and that Operation Domino looks quite different
from XDSpy, it is likely that the three groups share the same exploit broker.

Figure 3. Parts of the exploit code, including the beginning, are similar to that used in a DarkHotel campaign
described by JPCERT

Finally, the group jumped on the COVID-19 wagon at least twice in 2020. It first used this theme in a
spearphishing campaign against Belarusian institutions in February 2020. Then, in September 2020, they
reused this theme against Russian-speaking targets. The archive contained a malicious Windows Script
File (WSF) that downloads XDDown, as shown in Figure 4, and they used official website
rospotrebnadzor.ru as a decoy, as shown in Figure 5.

Malware components
Figure 4 shows the malware architecture in a scenario where the compromise happens through a LNK file,
as was the case in February 2020.

XDDown is the main malware component and is strictly a downloader. It persists on the system using the
traditional Run key. It downloads additional plugins from the hardcoded C&C server using the HTTP
protocol. The HTTP replies contain PE binaries encrypted with a hardcoded two-byte XOR key.
During our research, we discovered the following plugins:
XDRecon: Gathers basic information about the victim machine (the computer name, the current
username and the Volume Serial Number of the main drive).
XDList: Crawls the C: drive for interesting files (.accdb, .doc, .docm, .docx, .mdb, .xls, .xlm, .xlsx,
.xlsm, .odt, .ost, .ppt, .pptm, .ppsm, .pptx, .sldm, .pst, .msg, .pdf, .eml, .wab) and exfiltrates the paths
of these files. It can also take screenshots.
XDMonitor: Similar to XDList. It also monitors removable drives to exfiltrate the files matching an
interesting extension.
XDUpload: Exfiltrates a hardcoded list of files from the filesystem to the C&C server, as shown in
Figure 5. The paths were sent to the C&C servers by XDList and XDMonitor.

XDLoc: Gathers nearby SSIDs (such as Wi-Fi access points), probably in order to geo-locate the
victim machines.
XDPass: Grabs saved passwords from various applications such as web browsers and email
programs.
More details about the various malware components can be found in the white paper.

Conclusion
XDSpy is a cyberespionage group mostly undetected for more than nine years while being very busy over
the past few months. It is mostly interested in stealing documents from government entities in Eastern
Europe and the Balkans. This targeting is quite unusual and makes it an interesting group to follow.
The group’s technical proficiency tends to vary a bit. It has used the same basic malware architecture for
nine years, but it also recently exploited a vulnerability patched by the vendor but for which no public proofof-concept exists, a so-called 1-day exploit.
