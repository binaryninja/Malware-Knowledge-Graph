CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Key Judgments
• Insikt Group is confident that the identified
SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure can be attributed to
the threat activity group publicly reported as NOBELIUM;
this confidence is based on the use of overlapping
network infrastructure previously attributed to NOBELIUM
in public reporting, as well as unique variations of Cobalt
Strike traditionally used by the group.
This report profiles the unique infrastructure used by Russian statesponsored threat activity group NOBELIUM. The activity was identified through
a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and analysis
derived from open source reporting. Data sources include the Recorded Future
Platform, SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, Shodan, Censys, Team
Cymru’s Pure Signal™ and other common open-source tools and techniques. The
report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational
intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian government in cyberspace and
network defenders. Some technical details from our original research have not
been included in this report version in order to protect tracking techniques and
ongoing research into NOBELIUM activity.

Executive Summary

• Broader themes in SOLARDEFLECTION C2 typosquats
have included the misuse of brands across multiple
industry verticals, particularly in the news and media
industries.
• Cobalt Strike servers related to SOLARDEFLECTION
monitoring that were also previously linked to NOBELIUM
activity used modified server configurations, likely in an
attempt to remain undetected from researchers actively
scanning for standard Cobalt Strike server features.
• NOBELIUM has made extensive use of typosquat
domains in SSL certificates and will likely continue to use
deceptive techniques, including typosquat redirection,
when using Cobalt Strike tooling.

Activity Spotlight: Role of Cobalt Strike

Recorded Future continues to monitor NOBELIUM by distilling
vast swaths of open source and technical data and combining it
with analysts’ intimate knowledge of attacker tradecraft. Network
Traffic Analysis analytics enable users to investigate and track
suspected targeted intrusion activity derived from validated
technical data sources. We apply a series of filters and algorithms
to spot suspicious network traffic concerning these detected
malicious servers, highlighting possible targeted intrusion
activity. Intelligence Card extensions within the Recorded Future
Platform then allow users to enrich this information further using
data from close partners such as SecurityTrails, thereby enabling
Recorded Future Threat Intelligence module users to efficiently
map out prospective adversary campaigns.

Some of the key characteristics used for SOLARDEFLECTION
and LUNARREFLECTION have been the prevalent use of specific
Cobalt Strike instances, including custom payload configurations,
unique SSL certificates, and the likely use of cs2modrewrite
to obfuscate C2 traffic. Cobalt Strike servers previously linked
to NOBELIUM activity used modified server configurations
to remain undetected by security researchers monitoring for
standard Cobalt Strike server features. NOBELIUM has made
extensive use of typosquat domains in SSL certificates and has
used deceptive techniques including redirection when using
Cobalt Strike tooling.

Over the course of our research, Insikt Group observed
multiple uncommon characteristics unique to NOBELIUM that
serve as distinguishable hallmarks in terms of our potential to
track this activity long term. The elements described below are
some of the trackable characteristics which have been found
to be used when investigating NOBELIUM-linked infrastructure
with the resulting derived infrastructure covered under
SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION.

Analyzing infrastructure clustered under SOLARDEFLECTION
and LUNARREFLECTION revealed hallmarks that pointed to the
likely use of cs2modrewrite, a modification technique for Cobalt
Strike-based infrastructure developed by members of Threat
Express, an information security blog “created by red teamers,
penetration testers and security professionals”.
Details of the functionality of cs2modrewrite from its GitHub
repository state, “This project converts a Cobalt Strike profile to
a functional mod_rewrite .htaccess or Nginx config file to support
HTTP reverse proxy redirection to a Cobalt Strike TeamServer.
The use of reverse proxies provides protection to backend
C2 servers from profiling, investigation, and general internet
background radiation”. Infrastructure linked to cs2modrewrite
instances can be set up in several different ways, including
separating the hosting of the reverse proxy server and Cobalt
Strike server, or co-hosting the reverse proxy and Cobalt Strike
on the same server.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Outlook
As tensions continue to rise in Eastern Europe, we expect
to see a continuation of cyber operations being conducted by
Russian-nexus groups, likely including NOBELIUM, in line with
national strategic interests. Russia will likely also continue to
exert influence over other governments, which may lead to
additional computer network operations aimed at furthering
strategic advantage. Typosquatting is likely to remain an integral
technique for multiple threat entities supporting Russian national
interests in the near future. Insikt Group has already observed
groups that support these interests weaponize domains themed
around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to great effect. This likely
includes not only the domains belonging to one organization,
but third-party partners and vendors with enterprise network
access.
