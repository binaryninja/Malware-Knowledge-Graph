Welcome from the NCCIC and ICS-CERT
The past year was an eventful one for both the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and
the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team’s (ICS-CERT) Assessment program.
Cyber incidents at home and abroad in FY 2016 highlighted the continued and significant risks associated with cyberattacks on industrial control systems (ICS). To meet both new and existing cybersecurity challenges, ICS-CERT redoubled
efforts to provide its customers with comprehensive assessments of their ICS cybersecurity posture, arming them with both
understanding of their cyber vulnerabilities and with the expert guidance they need to mitigate ICS cyber threats.
The third ICS-CERT Annual Assessment Report captures the Assessment team’s consolidated discoveries and activities
throughout the year. The report summarizes our key discoveries (including the most common vulnerabilities across our
customer base), provides year-over-year vulnerability comparisons across critical infrastructure (CI) sectors, shows where
we focused our activity in FY2016, describes how customers can request an assessment, and provides our customers with
recommendations for enhancing their ICS cybersecurity posture.
The report also highlights some of the changes we are making to our assessment program to better serve our customers.
For example, in FY 2016 we launched Version 8.0 of our Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET), adding new functionality to
the tool. We began an extended hiring initiative to expand the number of assessment teams, enabling us to conduct more
assessments for more customers each year. We also stood up the ICS Federal Critical Infrastructure Assessments (ICSFCIA)
program, which focuses exclusively on providing assessments to Federal Government partners. The data and lessons we glean
from this effort will, in turn, inform and support our continued focus on CI owned by the private sector and by state and
local governments. Additionally, ICS-CERT is transitioning its assessment model from individual products to an integrated
assessment process that includes all assessment offerings as well as more advanced analytics to provide improved actionable
feedback to asset owners.
We hope our partners find the information contained in this report useful. We continue to look for ways to improve service
to our customers and we hope that the changes to our assessment program, along with the discoveries and continued
feedback that we provide our customers through our assessment team, will mitigate existing threats to control systems, help
our customers stay ahead of the cyber-threat curve, and minimize the duration and severity of incidents if they do occur.
Thank you.

1. Introduction
Fiscal Year 2016 marks the third publishing year for the ICS-CERT Annual Assessment Report.
As in previous years, the report provides our stakeholders with important information they can use to help secure
their control systems and associated CI. This includes descriptions of the most common vulnerabilities found by our
assessment teams in FY 2016 and the cybersecurity actions we recommend ICS owners and operators take to improve their
cybersecurity posture.
Now more than ever, vital operational processes depend on secure and reliable control systems. In addition to traditional
industrial processes, rapid increases in the connectivity of operational technology through the Internet of Things raise new
challenges for control systems security. ICS-CERT continues to work with its government and private sector partners to
identify, understand, and mitigate cyber threats to control systems and the CI they support.

1.1 Our Mission
ICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure by strengthening the security and resilience of
control systems through public-private partnerships.
We pursue this mission through a comprehensive cybersecurity program that helps our government and private sector
partners improve ICS security across the entire risk management spectrum. For example, our Assessment team offers
CI partners a suite of products and services that include in-depth facilitated assessments — our Network Validation and
Verification (NAVV) and Design Architecture Review (DAR) assessments — as well as our Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool
(CSET), a downloadable software product that enables CI partners to conduct their own assessments against a range of
cybersecurity standards. Section 4 provides more detailed descriptions of our assessment program as well as instructions for
requesting an assessment.
In addition to our cybersecurity assessment program, we offer our partners a wide variety of platforms through which to
share technical information about new and existing ICS threats and vulnerabilities within a global partnership network.
We also help our partners through technical malware and vulnerability analysis in our dedicated laboratory, provide
cybersecurity training for all levels of knowledge and technical skill, and help our partners to respond to cybersecurity
incidents focused on control systems.
Through ICS-CERT, our partners can also request services available through other NCCIC components. Examples of available
services include machine-to-machine threat information exchange through the NCCIC’s Automated Indicator Sharing
program; enterprise network penetration testing, malware analysis, and incident response services; and cybersecurity
exercises. ICS-CERT works closely with the NCCIC components that provide these services to ensure that our government
and private sector partners can access the full range of NCCIC services and capabilities. Other NCCIC components include the
United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), National Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC),
National Cyber Exercise and Planning Program (NCEPP), and National Cybersecurity Assessment and Technical Services
(NCATS) team.

ICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk to the
Nation’s critical infrastructure by strengthening
the security and resilience of control systems
through public-private partnerships.

2. FY 2016 Assessment Summary
We conducted 130 assessments in FY 2016, more than in any previous year. We also began a multi-year initiative to expand
the number of Assessment teams we can field and to provide dedicated teams to support our Federal Government and CI
customers, respectively. Figure 1 provides a quick snapshot of our FY 2016 activities.

2.1 Overarching Discoveries
For the third consecutive year, ICS-CERT assessment teams found weaknesses related to boundary protection to be the most
prevalent. Weaknesses related to the principal of least functionality were the second most commonly discovered issues, as
was the case in FY 2015. Table 1 shows year-over-year comparisons of discovered weaknesses, in order of prevalence, from
FY 2014-16. Of note, while least privilege and allocation of resources categories fell out of the top six weaknesses (they
were fourth and fifth in FY 2015), in FY 2016 they were ranked seventh and eighth, respectively. These changes may be
due to the year-over-year variances in the types of assets assessed rather than to shifts in the overarching ICS cybersecurity
posture. Table 2 describes the potential consequences that may result from exploitation of these weaknesses.

2.2 FY 2016 Assessment Coverage
The number of security assessments conducted in FY 2016 represents a 16 percent increase from FY 2015 and an increase
of 25 percent from FY 2014. There were also changes to the mix of assessments conducted in FY 2016, with the number of
facilitated CSET assessments declining — an ongoing trend since FY 2012 — as ICS-CERT’s other assessment services evolve
and customer demand for DAR and NAVV assessments increases.
Table 3 shows the number of facilitated assessments conducted by ICS-CERT since the program’s inception in 2009.

Table 3: Number of Assessments by Year and Type

ICS-CERT offers cybersecurity assessments of ICS to
both government and private sector organizations
across all 16 CI sectors. ICS-CERT conducts all private
sector assessments in response to voluntary requests
from CI owners and operators. As a result, year-toyear fluctuations in assessments for a given CI sector
are generally demand driven (based on customer
requests). However, ICS-CERT prioritizes scheduling
of assessments using a variety of factors, including
sector or facility risk profile, the reliance of the CI
asset on control systems, and geographic clustering
of CI to ensure the most effective and efficient use of
existing resources (it is generally more efficient to
conduct assessments on multiple facilities of geographic
proximity to one another).
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT conducted assessments in
12 of the 16 CI sectors. These include the Chemical
(7 assessments), Commercial Facilities (4),
Communications (5), Critical Manufacturing (5),
Dams (2), Emergency Services (3), Energy (22),
Food and Agriculture (3), Government Facilities
(10), Information Technology (3), Transportation
Systems (10), and Water and Wastewater Systems
(56). The Water and Wastewater Systems and Energy
Sectors, which together represented 60 percent of all
assessments, are both heavily dependent on control
systems to manage operational processes. The Defense
Industrial Base, Financial Services, Healthcare and Public
Health, and Nuclear Reactors, Materials and Waste

WORKING TO SUPPORT REGIONAL CI RESILIENCE
In conjunction with DHS’s Office of Infrastructure
Protection and DHS Protective Security Advisors,
ICS-CERT participates in the Regional Resiliency
Assessment Program (RRAP).
RRAP is a cooperative assessment of specific CI within
a designated geographic area and a regional analysis
of the surrounding infrastructure to address a range of
infrastructure resilience issues.
The RRAP program presents results from RRAP
activities, research, and analysis in a Resiliency
Assessment report with key findings that provide RRAP
participants option for consideration for enhanced
resilience. Facility owners and operators, regional
organizations, and government agencies use the
Resiliency Assessment and key findings to guide
strategic investments in equipment, planning, training,
and resources to enhance the resilience and protection
of facilities, surrounding communities, and entire
regions.

Sectors did not request assessments in FY 2016. Figure 2 compares assessments conducted in FY 2015 and FY 2016. The
types of organizations for which ICS-CERT conducts assessments vary and include both small and large facilities with a range
of cybersecurity resources and technical expertise. ICS-CERT anonymizes data collected during assessments for use in trend
and other analyses.

3. Primary Discoveries and
Mitigation Recommendations
This section describes specific discoveries and mitigation recommendations for the top six weaknesses ICS-CERT assessment
teams found in FY 2016. It also provides a complete list of all weakness categories.
The recommendations provided in this section are consistent with best security practices for protecting control systems from
threats of unauthorized use. In addition, to support overarching ICS security, ICS-CERT maintains a portfolio of guidance
and best practices documents on its website (https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/). These include, for example, ICS-CERT’s Improving
Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies and Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems reports.
ICS-CERT encourages its partners to review these and other ICS-CERT information products. In its FY2015 Industrial Control
Systems Assessment Summary Report, ICS-CERT also identified several overarching observations impacting ICS security. Summarized
below, these observations remain pertinent in FY 2016.
A. Inadequate access security controls for virtual machines (VMs).
Inadequate user access security controls to the hypervisor (VM monitor) host management interface may provide a single
point of failure and entry that adversaries could use to gain access to every guest VM on the host computer, allowing
potential unauthorized access to any part of the ICS.
B. Insecure implementation of remote access.
Whether access is from the corporate network to the ICS or from the Internet to the ICS, this access may present a serious
risk to the system. Attackers can gain access to user accounts at the users’ home or corporate office and obtain the user
credentials and connection to access critical ICS assets or allow an infected computer an access channel into the networks via
a virtual private network (VPN) connection.
C. Improper use of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN).
While VLANs can logically segment networks, if users do not follow best practices of the hardware vendors, unauthorized
users can traverse to other VLAN segments. Default and native VLANs that remain unchanged on trunk ports provide an
avenue to traverse from one VLAN to another.
D. Weak Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) security policies for ICS.
Mobile and other devices are not typically managed by the organization and security policies implemented by the
organization are often not implemented on the portable devices. Use of BYOD devices to access personal email, web pages,
and social media applications, are inherently high risk to ICS.
E. Insufficient hardening of cloud services security and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for critical ICS functions.
Organizations must ensure that the parts of any ICS architecture hosted externally maintain security levels consistent with
the criticality of the ICS functions. Organizations should also ensure that SLAs are sufficient to maintain ICS operational
functions associated with recovery, event/incident management, failover, forensic support, monitoring, and other operational
functions that may require support by the cloud-hosting service provider.
F. Inadequate adoption of ICS Network Monitoring as a core Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy.
Network monitoring is an essential security measure for any critical system as an important part of the attacker life cycle
is to establish a command and control presence in the system. An attacker will leverage this to receive system discovery
information and determine how to best implement a customized attack toolkit to exploit system vulnerability and achieve
attack goals. Most CI organizations have some level of monitoring at the corporate level, rarely within ICS networks.
Figure 4, on the following page, illustrates these potential network attack scenarios.

3.1 Detailed Discussion of Top Identified Vulnerabilities
While ICS-CERT assessments identified weaknesses across all control families, six categories represented roughly 36
percent of the total vulnerabilities discovered across assessed CI sectors. The top six categories were Boundary Protection;
Least Functionality; Identification and Authentication; Physical Access Control; Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting; and
Authenticator Management. ICS-CERT’s assessment methodology categorizes weaknesses based on the National Institute
of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Special Publication 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations,” control family sub-categories (See Appendix A for Control Family descriptions). This section
summarizes the six most common vulnerabilities by Security Control Family, subcategory, prevalence, potential risk, and
recommended mitigations.

ICS-CERT Annual Assessment Report FY 2016

Recommended Mitigation
• Separate the enterprise network from the ICS network
and establish a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two
systems for ICS perimeter protection. Refer to NIST 800-SP
82, Chapter 5, for information on designing perimeter
protections for ICS.
• The DMZ should house a dedicated “jump” server that
permits systems on the enterprise network (or those
accessing via a remote method such as VPN) to access data
elements derived from the ICS network.
• Harden the jump server, running only essential services.
Credentials for this server should not be the same as those
used for authentication to systems on the enterprise network.
• Restrict communication flows to this server to the minimal
subset of those required to support secure methods for
accessing ICS systems (when needed to access from outside
the standard ICS network).
• Incorporate logging and monitoring of information derived
from this system with continued verification.
• Security devices and systems need to be resident n the DMZ
to support ICS system network equipment patching and
updates (antivirus update server, Windows Server Update
Services (WSUS) patch update, etc.).

4. ICS-CERT’s Assessment Program
ICS-CERT launched the Assessment Program in 2009 with the goal of helping CI owners and operators understand and
improve their control systems security posture. Initially focused on facilitated assessments using CSET — which provides
a good initial security overview — in 2012, the assessment program expanded its offerings to include detailed, in-depth
technical assessments through DAR and NAVV assessments.

4.1 Support Structure for Government and Private Sector Customers
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT established a dedicated federal facilities assessment team and a dedicated private sector assessment
team. These teams provide support to their respective customers under an integrated management and data sharing structure
that ensures anonymized and protected information gleaned from both federal and private sector assessments support
analytical efforts to improve overarching control systems security.

4.1.1 ICS-CERT Private Sector Assessment Team
A core part of ICS-CERT’s mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s CI is to provide onsite cybersecurity assessments to CI asset
owners and operators to strengthen their ICS cybersecurity posture. ICS-CERT bases assessments on standards, guidelines,
and best practices, and are provided to CI asset owners and operators at no cost using our congressional funding. Our
assessment methodologies provide a structured framework that asset owners and operators can use to assess, re-assess,
protect, detect, and continually validate the cybersecurity of their ICS networks. The information gained from assessments
also provides stakeholders with the understanding and context necessary to build effective defense-in-depth processes for
enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
ICS-CERT’s Private Sector Assessment team works with CI asset owners to determine which set of assessment services best fits
the needs of that particular organization. The services provided may include a combination of a facilitated CSET, DAR, and/or
NAVV assessments, depending on the current state and goals of the organization. Information shared with ICS-CERT can be
protected under the auspices of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program.

4.1.2 Industrial Control Systems Federal Critical Infrastructure Assessment Team (ICSFCIA)
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT established the ICSFCIA to provide dedicated assessment support for federal partners. The ICSFCIA
offers federal organizations a comprehensive suite of assessment services, including a research-based “state of security”
evaluation that explores potentially risky open source information about a facility or system, a Maturity Level Evaluation
(MLE) using CSET, identification of indicators of compromise, DAR and NAVV assessments, log analysis, and Operational
Sustainability. Upon completion of all assessments, ICSFCIA will compile an in-depth report for the federal facility owner,
which includes a prioritized analysis of key discoveries and practical mitigations for enhancing the cybersecurity posture of
the organization.
Through this program, ICS-CERT also works closely with the NCCIC’s NCATS team. NCATS conducts cybersecurity
assessments on enterprise networks, with a focus on the Federal Government’s most critical assets. ICS-CERT works with
NCATS to provide ICS-specific assessments and technical expertise to improve ICS security for these assets.

4.2 Assessment Elements
In order to categorize assessment discoveries, ICS-CERT bases assessment and analysis of security vulnerabilities on NIST
Special Publication 800-53. NIST 800-53 control family mappings provide a consistent and repeatable methodology for
collecting and correlating data to analyze and trend key discoveries at a holistic level.
NIST Special Publication 800-82, “Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security,” implements an ICS overlay to NIST
800-53, tailoring security guidance to the unique ICS operational and system characteristics. While NIST Special Publication
800-82 applies generally to all CI control systems, ICS CERT works with sector stakeholders to provide additional tailoring to
unique aspects of individual customers, as necessary. Appendix A shows the top-level NIST 800-53 Security Control Families.

ICS-CERT offers a combination of processes in support of an integrated assessment product suite. Assessment products and
services include
• Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET)
• Design Architecture Review (DAR)
• Network Validation and Verification (NAVV)
ICS-CERT’s cybersecurity assessment services include evaluation of ICS design architecture, verification and validation
of network traffic, and systems log review and analysis. An evaluation of the design architecture includes a high level
preliminary evaluation of the site security posture, leveraging CSET, followed by an in-depth review and evaluation of the ICS
network design, configuration, and inter-connectivity to internal and external systems. This system analysis provides ICS asset
owners with a comprehensive cybersecurity evaluation focusing on defensive strategies associated with their specific control
systems network.
Network data traffic analysis provides asset owners with information to identify anomalous and potentially suspicious
communications sourced from, or destined for, control systems assets. This service offering provides a sophisticated analysis
of the asset owner’s network traffic, which asset owners collect, from within their control system network environment.
ICS-CERT subject matter experts (SME) analyze the captured network traffic using a combination of open source and
commercially available tools to develop a detailed representation of the communications, flows, and relationships between
devices.

4.2.1 Cyber Security Evaluation Tool
DHS developed CSET to enable CI owners and operators to conduct a basic evaluation of their ICS cybersecurity posture
based on standards and practices best suited to their sector.
CI customers can use CSET to support both self-assessments as well as ICS-CERT facilitated assessments, undertaken in
conjunction with DAR and NAVV assessments. CSET is available as a no-cost download. CSET maps user input to questions
associated with selected cybersecurity standards and best practices. To maximize the effectiveness of the CSET evaluation
process, the asset owner should include SMEs from various disciplines to conduct the guided discovery-oriented evaluation
of the entity’s underlying control processes, procedures, policies, methodologies, and protective and detective security
controls. In FY 2016, ICS-CERT released CSET Version 8.0, which added a number of new features to the tool, including
a simplified user interface, five new standards, specialized question sets, and new component additions to the network
diagram function.

4.2.2 Design Architecture Review
A DAR is an assessment process facilitated by ICS-CERT assessment personnel. ICS-CERT works with system owners and
operators to perform a thorough manual assessment and analysis of the operational process. ICS-CERT focuses on assessing
the security of the underlying control system architecture, the integration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational
Technology (OT), vendor support, network monitoring, cybersecurity controls, and a review of internal and external
connections used within the control systems environment. The process focuses heavily on ICS Network Architecture, Asset
Inventory, and Protective and Detective Security controls.
This review provides asset owners with a thorough evaluation of system interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and mitigation
options. ICS-CERT examines information related to key ICS external connections and includes an in-depth review of control
systems design documents, drawings, and architectures. ICS-CERT provides a detailed final report to the user that captures
the key discoveries identified by the team and provides potential impact and recommended mitigations for each.

4.2.3 Network Architecture Validation and Verification
The NAVV assessment process entails the analysis of (passively captured) traffic within the ICS network. Using a combination
of open-source and commercially available tools, ICS-CERT visualizes and performs analysis on the network traffic and
device-to- device communications occurring within various ICS network segments to identify potentially unauthorized or
suspect communications. Threat data analysis of the traffic evaluates indicators of known unauthorized attacks in the user’s
network.

This assessment enables asset owners to
• Verify the accuracy of ICS network diagrams;
• Identify rogue or misconfigured devices or malicious data communications;
• Analyze data flows to ensure boundary protection devices work as designed;
• Identify opportunities or areas to improve zoning and perimeter protections;
• Baseline the ICS network (including a protocol hierarchy and organization of network traffic); and
• Gain practical knowledge of how to passively monitor and verify the communications occurring within their ICS
networks.
The process provides organizations with a comprehensive view of network communication occurring within the ICS
network infrastructure, in addition to those communications sourced from or destined to ICS network segments. ICS-CERT
typically provides this review as a part of the overall assessment service, however they also offer it independently.

4.3 The Assessment Process: What to Expect
ICS-CERT schedules and conducts assessments based on available resources. The integrated assessment process typically
contains several phases. A baseline evaluation begins the assessment using CSET, followed by DAR and NAVV assessments.
While assessments could be performed at any of the levels individually (CSET, DAR, or NAVV), the process is most effective
when all three elements are performed together. Figure 5 describes ICS-CERT’s assessment process.

4.3.1 Preparing for the Assessment
The ICS-CERT assessment team makes every effort to accommodate the needs and special circumstances of the organizations
with which it is working. Before scheduling an assessment, ICS-CERT must receive all pre-engagement paperwork.
Organizations should complete general pre-assessment documentation (that is, Request for Technical Assistance, Logistics
Form Request, and PCII Express Statement) and, following approval of those, network diagrams, network header data, and
inventory lists to review and discuss prior to scheduling the assessment.
Typical assessments take three to four days to complete, depending on the number and size of the systems assessed.
Organizations should invite any personnel who are familiar with or influence their site’s security policies, control system
architecture, topologies, and protocols to attend the assessment. These include control systems operators/engineers,
information technology personnel, policy and management personnel, and SMEs. ICS-CERT’s assessment team does not
connect to customers’ networks. The team will work from the information provided prior to the assessment, which it will
evaluate prior to visiting with the facility.
Upon completion of the assessment process, ICS-CERT compiles an in-depth report for the asset owner, including a
prioritized analysis of key discoveries and practical mitigations for enhancing the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
ICS-CERT also captures post-assessment feedback through a questionnaire and follow-up discussion 180 days after the
assessment. The feedback helps ICS-CERT improve its assessment offerings, gather information about the value of ICS-CERT’s
recommendations, and understand the degree to which the asset owner’s cybersecurity posture improved after the
assessment.

5. A Look Ahead to FY 2017
In FY 2017, ICS-CERT is launching a number of important initiatives to improve its assessment products, services, and
capabilities.
Our Private Sector Assessment team is transitioning the services it provides to CI customers from discrete CSET, DAR, and
NAVV assessments to an integrated process that includes all assessment offerings along with advanced analytics that provide
actionable feedback to asset owners. This integrated process will include a baseline assessment performed using CSET,
followed by a deep-dive design architecture review of the ICS, communications, and networking architecture, and analysis of
the network data communications. In FY 2017, the ICS-CERT Assessment Program will also add log analysis to its assessment
services. Log analysis can rapidly identify issues such as misconfigured equipment and communications links and, more
importantly, system intrusions. Asset owners submit useful system or event logs, which provide a sampling of the central
control system elements, such as an ICS server, a Historian/Database collector, or a remotely connected human-machine
interface (HMI) system.
Successfully piloted in FY 2016, this integrated assessment process found abnormal network traffic, which indicated a
potential system breach during several onsite assessments. On such occasions, the ICS-CERT assessment team coordinated
with the asset owner and contacted the NCCIC’s incident response team to provide additional assistance through the
mitigation process.
ICS-CERT will also expand the scope and number of assessment services it provides federal facility partners through its
newly established ICSFCIA program. ICSFCIA focuses on identifying the health of the control systems within the Federal
Government against advance persistent threats. These assessments provide federal partners with in-depth security evaluations,
information on attack paths, indicators of compromise, and mitigation techniques to secure ICS environments. ICS-CERT is
also adding an operational sustainability capability to help review and maintain prepared, resilient, and secure federal ICS.
Through the ICSFCIA program, ICS-CERT will also be a primary contributor to a comprehensive and coordinated interagency
effort to secure building and access control systems for more than 9,000 facilities in the federal portfolio. In close
partnership with the General Services Administration, Federal Protective Service, and the Interagency Security Committee,
ICS-CERT is providing assessment services for the highest-risk federal facilities, technical expertise, and training resources to
support this important interagency effort. ICS-CERT will also support and participate in developing the standards utilized by
federal facilities for assessing cyber risk to control systems (for example, Interagency Security Committee standards).

6. Conclusion
ICS-CERT looks forward to continuing to support its private sector and government partners in securing their control
systems. Leveraging the insights gained through our assessment data and customer feedback in FY 2016, we will build
upon and enhance the capabilities and technical expertise we added to our assessment program for FY 2017. This includes
ongoing maturation of the ICSFCIA program for our federal partners, continued evolution of our private sector assessments
from individual offerings into a more comprehensive assessment process that includes log analysis, and building additional
features into CSET to best meet our customers’ needs. We will also continue to coordinate closely with other federal agencies,
providing their constituents with access to ICS-CERT assessment and other cybersecurity offerings. ICS-CERT thanks its
partners for the opportunity to support them and for their continued commitment to control systems security.
