brighttalk.com/webcast/10703/275683

Presented by
Stuart Davis, Director, Mandiant; Nick Carr, Senior Manager, TORE Detection & Analysis

About this talk
Recent investigations by FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants combined with
FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of a
suspected Iranian threat group, that we believe has been operating since at least 2013.
Join us in a live webinar as we discuss this threat group whom we asses to be involved in a
long-term, resource intensive cyber espionage operation motivated by the prospect of
collecting strategic intelligence, including information related to the aviation and energy
industries, which would ultimately benefit a nation-state or military sponsor. Register today
to gain deeper insights into this threat group!
