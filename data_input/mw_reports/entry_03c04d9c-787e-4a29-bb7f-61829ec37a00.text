(Don't) Bring Dridex Home for the Holidays
inquest.net/blog/2021/12/20/dont-bring-dridex-home-holidays

With the holiday season upon us and Log4j-nia still keeping most of us awake at night, we
want to revisit an old chum who continues to operate in full swing amidst the chaos. With
fresh tactics at their disposal, Dridex continues to target large organizations with somewhat
elaborate lures to ensure user interaction and infection. On Monday, December 15th we
noticed an uptick in the amount of verified malware hiding behind password-protected
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, specifically ones containing the dated "macrosheet"
functionality. One of the ongoing experiments we have running atop of InQuest Labs data is
a limited brute force of these suspicious files. We will be exploring additional evasion
methods leveraged by the Dridex campaign to deliver the payload.
1/11

At first glance, the samples containing image lures appear to be using blurred documents to
entice users to enable macros. We have observed a variety of different subject lures during
this campaign including a CDC COVID-19 form along with a fake resume, a personnel form
and fake spreadsheets. As seen in the last two lure images, attackers seem to also be
masquerading as the NPD group and their DecisionKey reporting software.

Continuing the trend of delivering initial stage content via maldocs, Dridex has shifted to
generating random numerical passwords to protect attached Microsoft Office docs. Dridex
operators have gone as far as crafting emails that appear to be legitimate team/department
memos and instructions. What follows are examples of these emails sent containing
passwords to decrypt the attached documents.

An effective evasion method to slow analysis efforts, especially if one is not actively cracking
documents or zip archives as password protected content continues to become more
mainstay amongst malware families. Once cracked, we notice a macrosheet containing
suspicious content; and with a little deobfuscation, we have our first clues.

CALL

As we can see, the macro calls an embedded .vbs file that fetches the next step of the attack
chain. Using Discordâ€™s CDN servers for distribution as threat actors have been leveraging
heavily in recent campaigns, Dridex fetches a .bin that fetches additional payloads upon
execution. The payloads specific to Dridex are easily identifiable by URI pattern/file name,
which will not be published due to the racially insensitive nature of their naming convention.
Like any campaign, we can expect that future iterations of Dridex will change tactics and
become more elusive. Changes observed between now and the numbered password uptick
see slight changes in URI patterns and lure messages. We will continue monitoring these
changes as the Dridex campaign continues on.

X-mas Lure

As we get together with loved ones this season, we must remain vigilant of those seeking to
rain on our revelry as we move into the new year. From all of us at InQuest: stay safe, happy
holidays and happy new year.
