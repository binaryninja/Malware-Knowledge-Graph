In January 2022, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts detected a wave of targeted attacks
on military industrial complex enterprises and public institutions in several Eastern
European countries and Afghanistan. In the course of our research, we were able to
identify over a dozen of attacked organizations.
The attackers were able to penetrate dozens of enterprises and even hijack the IT
infrastructure of some, taking control of systems used to manage security solutions.
An analysis of information obtained during our investigation indicates that
cyberespionage was the goal of this series of attacks.

Executive summary
The attackers penetrate the enterprise network using carefully crafted phishing
emails, some of which contain information that is specific to the organization
under attackand is not publicly available. This could indicate that the attackers
did preparatory work in advance (they may have obtained the information in
earlier attacks on the same organization or its employees or on other
organizations or individuals associated with the victim organization).
Microsoft Word documents attached to the phishing emails contain malicious
code that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The vulnerability enables an
attacker to execute arbitrary code (in the attacks analyzed, the main module of
the PortDoor malware) without any additional user activity.
An earlier series of attacks in which the PortDoor malware was also used was
described by Cybereason experts.
In the new series of attacks, the attackers used six different backdoors at the
same time – probably to set up redundant communication channels with
infected systems in case one of the malicious programs was detected and
removed by a security solution. The backdoors used provide extensive
functionality for controlling infected systems and collecting confidential data.
The Ladon hacking utility is used as the main lateral movement tool. It combines
network scanning, vulnerability search and exploitation, password attack, and
other functionality. The attackers also extensively use standard utilities that are
part of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
The attack’s final stage involves hijacking the domain controller and gaining
complete control of all of the organization’s workstations and servers. After
gaining domain administrator privileges, the attackers search for and exfiltrate
documents and other files that contain the attacked organization’s sensitive
data to their servers hosted in different countries. These servers are also used
as CnC servers.
The attackers compressed stolen files into encrypted and password-protected
ZIP archives. After receiving the data collected, the CnC servers forwarded the
archives received to a stage two server located in China.
The attackers used DLL hijacking and process hollowing techniques extensively
in the attack to prevent security software from detecting the malware.
Our analysis of information obtained during the investigation suggests that it is
highly probable that a Chinese-speaking group is behind the attacks.

Our researchers identified malware and CnC servers that have earlier been used
in attacks attributed by other researchers to TA428, a Chinese-speaking APT
group.
We believe that the series of attacks that we have identified is highly likely to be
an extension of a known campaign described in Cybereason, DrWeb, and
NTTSecurity research and has been attributed with a high degree of confidence
to APT TA428 activity.

Technical details
Initial infection
In January 2022, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts uncovered a new wave of
targeted attacks on military-industrial complex enterprises and public
institutions in several countries of Eastern Europe and Afghanistan.
The attackers penetrated the enterprise network using carefully crafted
phishing emails. In the course of our investigation, we discovered that, in some
cases, the attackers create phishing emails using information that is not publicly
available, such as the full names of employees responsible for handling sensitive
information, as well as internal codenames of projects developed by attacked
organizations.
Phishing emails contain Microsoft Word documents with embedded malicious
code that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The text in such documents
is crafted using specific details on the organization’s operation, some of which
may not be publicly available.
An analysis of document metadata has shown that, with a high degree of
likelihood, the attackers stole the document (while it was still legitimate) from
another military industrial complex enterprise, after which they modified it using
a weaponizer, a program designed to inject malicious code into documents.

The document provides rationale for research and development work related to
developing a new product that is to be conducted by the attacked enterprise as
the primary contractor.
The CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability exists in outdated versions of the Microsoft
Equation Editor (a Microsoft Office component). It enables an attacker to use a
specially crafted byte sequence masked as an equation, which, when processed,
will result in arbitrary code being executed on behalf of the user.
However, a malicious document can still be visually detected by noticing an
unusual equation object:

The vulnerability enables the malware to gain control of an infected system
without any additional user activity. For example, there is no need for the user to
enable macros, which is required by most attacks.

The malicious code embedded in the document drops PortDoor malware.
According to the Cybereason blog post, the malware has earlier been used by
the TA428 APT.
The PortDoor executable is first extracted to the %AppData%\Local\Temp
directory with the name 8.t, after which it is moved to the Microsoft Word
startup directory, %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP, with a
name that is specific to each attack, such as strsrv.wll. The malware is installed
as a Microsoft Word add-in, enabling the attackers to get a foothold and gain
remote control of the infected system.
After launching, the malware collects general information about the infected
system, such as computer name, IP addresses, etc., and sends the information
collected to the CnC server. In cases where profiling results show that the
system is of interest to the attackers, they use the backdoor functionality in
PortDoor to control the system remotely and deploy additional malware.

Initial infection of a system

Malware implants
The attackers deploy several backdoors at the same time on those systems that
are of interest to them. In all likelihood, they use the tactic to create redundant
channels of communication with an infected system, e.g., in case one of the
malicious programs is removed by a security solution.

PortDoor
Although the functionality of PortDoor was described in the Cybereason blog
post, we present the findings of our research to show in what ways the new
version of the malware is different from the older version.

After launching, the malware decrypts the part of its executable file that
contains configuration information:

Table 1. Descriptions of malware configuration information fields

After decrypting the configuration information, the malware checks that it is not
running in a debugger. It also checks whether a file with the name specified in the
configuration information, such as 78936077.tmp, exists in the temporary file
directory.
If the file does not exist, it is created by the malware and a value equal to the
product of a pseudorandom number and the time that has passed since system
startup is written to it. If the file exists, the malware reads the value written to it
earlier.
PortDoor uses the above algorithm to create a unique infected system ID, which
is sent to the attackers every time PortDoor connects to the CnC server. The ID
TARGETED ATTACK ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

is needed because infected systems in the same organization can have the same
victim ID and external IP address (because they are behind NAT).
Next, the malware establishes a connection with a CnC server using the address
and port specified in the configuration information. Data sent to the CnC server,
as well as data received in response, is encrypted using AES with a key that is
also taken from the configuration information.
After receiving a response from the CnC server, the malware checks that it
contains a special string. In the malware sample discussed here, the string has
the value “Kr*^j4”. The malware starts dynamically importing Windows API
functions by hashes and subsequently executing the payload only if the strings
match. It cannot be said for certain why the attackers implemented this logic in
PortDoor. One possible answer is that this may be a way to check the
compatibility of the Trojan’s versions with the CnC server.
As mentioned above, PortDoor dynamically imports Windows API functions by
hashes. The technique eliminates the need for the threat actor to include strings
with the names of imported functions in its code to reduce the chances of the
malware being detected. The malware first loads the necessary libraries into
memory, after which PortDoor reads a loaded library’s export table and
calculates the checksum of each exported function’s name until it finds a match
with a hash value hard-coded into the malware:

When it has completed searching for and importing the necessary functions, the
malware enters a loop, waiting for commands from its CnC server.

nccTrojan
In the course of our investigation, we also identified the nccTrojan malware on
many infected systems. The malware has earlier been used in attacks attributed
by NTTSecurity experts to the TA428 APT group. In the series of attacks
described by the researchers, the attackers used the first version of nccTrojan,
as well as versions 2 and 2.1. In January 2022, we identified a new, improved
version of nccTrojan – 2.45, as evidenced by the path to the .pdb file and the
configuration information of the malware.
The installation of nccTrojan is performed by downloading files from the
PortDoor CnC server. The executable file (DLL library) of nccTrojan is
downloaded as a .cab archive with an arbitrary name, e.g., wam.dll.cab. To unpack
it, the attackers use the expand system utility. The file is unpacked into an
existing directory used by legitimate software, e.g.,
%ProgramData%\Intel\ShaderCache, %Program Files%\Common
Files\AV\Norton Security Ultra, %ProgramData%\2GIS,
%ProgramData%\Adobe, etc.
The attackers also download a special installer component to the infected
system. It registers the DLL of nccTrojan as a service, ensuring that the malware
is loaded automatically at system startup. Curiously, nccTrojan version 2.45 is
bundled with an installer that is apparently inherited from a previous version
(2.43), as evidenced by the path to the .pdb file.

Installation of nccTrojan malware

After launching, the main nccTrojan module connects to CnC servers and waits
for a command that should be executed. The malware attempts to connect to all
CnC servers hard-coded into the executable file. All subsequent communication
is carried out with the server that was the first to respond.
When connecting to the CnC server, the malware sends general information
about the infected system to the attackers, including computer name, user
name, local IP address, system localization information, malware version, etc. ‘

Array with data on an infected system collected by nccTrojan

Like PortDoor, nccTrojan has backdoor functionality. Thus, the attackers get
two channels for controlling the infected system at the same time. In addition,
nccTrojan has functionality that uploads information collected by the attackers
to the CnC server. Among other things, it is used to steal files containing
confidential information. A complete list of commands supported by nccTrojan
version 2.45 is provided below:

Cotx and DNSep
Similarly to nccTrojan, the attackers download backdoors known as Cotx and
DNSep in .cab archives to computers being infected at the lateral movement
stage. The malware was described in a Dr.Web research paper, so here we only
provide a few clarifications and updates relevant to the series of attacks that
we are describing.
The two malicious programs have identical functionality and differ only in some
parts of the code.
After delivering and unpacking Cotx/DNSep, the attackers use the DLL hijacking
technique in outdated and vulnerable versions of McAfee SecurityCenter, the
Sophos SafeStore Restore tool, and Intel Common User Interface. The malicious
library that is loaded and executed using the DLL hijacking technique decrypts
the backdoor’s executable file, which is located in a file with the extension .log.
Cotx executable files are encrypted using the AES256 algorithm. They are
decrypted using a key hard-coded into the malicious library:

DNSep executable files are unpacked using the RtlDecompressBuffer function.
After being decrypted, the backdoor is loaded into a legitimate process’s
memory using the process hollowing technique and connects to the CnC server.
In the case of Cotx, malicious code is injected into the dllhost.exe process and in
the case of DNSep, it is injected into the process of powercfg.exe, a power
management utility.
A list of commands supported by the Cotx and DNSep backdoors is provided
below:

Logtu is downloaded, deployed and launched in the same way as Cotx and
DNSep, with the following exception: instead of using the process hollowing
technique with a system process, it is used with a legitimate software process
into which a malicious library has been loaded.
A list of commands supported by Logtu is shown below:

whether file <a> exists – if the file exists, <b>|<file size> is sent
to the server; if the file does not exist –<b>|01 is sent to the
server, after which the file <a>.tut is created and the
character “0” is written to it 32 times

CotSam
In addition to all the malware described above, in the course of our research we
came across a new backdoor that is different from all others used in attacks
attributed by researchers to TA428. Due to its similarity with the Cotx backdoor,
we decided to name the malware Backdoor.Win32.CotSam.
In the process of developing the attack, the attackers have used two methods
of deploying the malware at the same time.
In the first case, the attackers delivered a vulnerable version of Microsoft Word
together with the malware. Microsoft Word 2007 was used for 32-bit systems
and Microsoft Word 2010 for 64-bit systems. DLL hijacking vulnerability was
exploited after loading WINWORD.EXE, resulting in control being passed to the
malicious library named wwlib.dll, which decrypts the file OEMPRINT.CAT from
the current directory by performing a simple xor operation with the key 0xAA:
Decrypting
the CotSam
malware module

Next, the WriteProcessMemory function is used to write the decrypted
executable file directly to the memory of the svchost.exe process.

In the second case, the attackers exploited DLL hijacking vulnerability in the
applaunch.exe application (MD5: 170D73BE3FE846E9070CFAE530F5A31C). It is
worth noting that the same version of applaunch.exe had previously been used
by other Chinese groups to distribute ShadowPad malware.
After launching, the backdoor extracts the proxy server’s parameters from the
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
Settings\ProxyServer registry key and connects to the CnC server, waiting for
commands.

Lateral movement
After gaining a foothold on the initial system, the attackers attempt to spread
the malware to other computers on the enterprise network. At this stage, the
attackers’ goal is to gain access to the domain controller and take full control of
the attacked organization’s infrastructure.
To launch their utilities and get the results of their operation, the attackers use a
remote shell provided by backdoor malware. In the course of our research, we
identified a series of commands executed on infected systems that the
attackers entered by hand (this is indicated both by the time intervals between
commands and by the output of results not being redirected anywhere except
standard output).

Collecting information on the enterprise’s infrastructure
The attackers mostly scanned the network using the NBTscan console utility,
which was delivered to victim computers as a .cab archive named ace.cab and
unpacked using the expand system utility:
expand.exe ace.cab ace.exe
ace -n 172.22.0.0/16

In some cases, we also saw that the Ladon hacking framework had been used.
The framework consists of numerous modules with diverse lateral movement
functionality, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Scanning the network and finding different types of devices.
Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the devices found.
Cracking passwords for resources on the network.
Searching for password hashes.
Searching for passwords in text files.
Remotely executing arbitrary code.

Fragment
of Ladon code

These tools enable an attacker to scan the entire infrastructure that is available
over the network and identify the most vulnerable computers on the network.
The attackers also collected information on users working on the system and
their network connections. Specifically, they were interested in RDP
connections:
query user
net user
net group
ipconfig /all
netstat -no
netstat -no | findstr 3389
netstat -ano | findstr 2589

Malware distribution
The attackers were able to move laterally by infecting one system after another,
gaining access to these systems using network scanning results and user
credentials stolen earlier. They used the net use and xcopy utilities to establish
network connections with remote systems and copy malware to those systems:
net use \\[IP address]\IPC$ "[password]" /u:"[user name]"
xcopy.exe /s \\[IP address]\c$\windows\web\*" $windir\Web\ /y /e /i /q

TARGETED ATTACK ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

19
© 2022 AO KASPERSKY LAB

In some cases, malware was launched using an open-source VBS script named
wmic.vbs, which the attackers also downloaded to remote systems:
cscript.exe //nologo wmic.vbs /cmd [IP address] [user name][password]
$appdata\ABBYY\Install.exe

The VBS script was originally developed as a penetration testing tool, but threat
actors often use it in real-world attacks. The script, wmic.vbs, executes
commands on behalf of a user account with administrative privileges using
WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).
In other cases, the attackers created a task in Windows Task Scheduler to
ensure that the malware started automatically:
schtasks /create /tn CacheTasks /tr “$appdata\ABBYY\FineReader\WINWORD.EXE” /sc
minute /mo 50 /ru “” /f

In cases where the attackers were able to reach closed networks (i.e., networks
that are not directly connected to the internet), they turned intermediate
systems (systems available from closed networks and at the same time
connected to the internet) into proxy servers. This enabled malware running on
systems that were part of closed networks to communicate with its CnC
servers. Setting up network traffic redirection in this case was a trivial task that
was also performed using standard Windows tools:
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 2589 <IP address> 443

Domain hijacking
After gaining access to the domain controller, the attackers stole the entire
database of Active Directory user password hashes. To do this, they first saved
a copy of system registry hives with a special cmd command:
reg save HKLM\SAM sam.save
reg save HKLM\SECURITY security.save

Next, they copied the file ntds.dit, which contains the Active Directory database,
including user password hashes. Curiously, the file ntds.dit is continuously used
by the system and cannot be copied using standard tools. To get around this
restriction, the attackers used a special utility designed to copy the file using the
Windows volume shadow copy service (VSS).

Utility designed
to copy files
using VSS

An example of a command launching the utility is shown below:
c:\programdata\microsoft\sc64.exe c:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit
c:\programdata\microsoft\ntds.dit

Using the contents of the system registry and the file ntds.dit, the attackers
were able to get logins and password hashes for all users of the domain. Next,
the attackers used hash cracking to gain authentication credentials for most
users from the attacked organization’s domain.
In cases where an attacked organization’s IT infrastructure includes several
domains, the attackers analyzed trust relationships between the domains to
identify accounts allowing them to move laterally:
nltest /domain_trusts

In the process of attacking a domain controller, the attackers obtained, among
others, the password hash of the user krbtgt (Active Directory service account),
enabling them to conduct an attack known as Golden Ticket. It allowed them to
issue Kerberos tickets (TGT) independently and authenticate on any Active
Directory service – all of this for an unlimited time.
In one of the cases analyzed, the attacked organization’s security team was able
to identify suspicious activity on the domain controller, after which the
passwords of those users whose accounts had been compromised were

changed. However, the attackers continued to act on behalf of these accounts
without any problems using Kerberos tickets. This shows that in the case of a
Golden Ticket attack, standard incident response methods are inadequate.
Finally, it is worth noting that in one of the cases the attackers were also able to
gain access to the server hosting the system that controls security solutions
and to remotely modify the settings of endpoint security solutions used by the
organization.

Infrastructure and data exfiltration
As part of a joint research project, we were granted access to the contents of
several CnC servers hosted in the infrastructure of a hosting service provider.
This provided us with additional threat actor activity information.
After gaining control of a major part of the attacked organization’s IT
infrastructure, the attackers moved on to the stage of stealing sensitive
information. All files collected by the attackers were packed into passwordprotected ZIP archives. To automate the process, the attackers used their own
build of the 7-Zip utility.

It is worth emphasizing that the attackers created their archives in such a way
that the names of the files in the archive, as well as their contents, were
encrypted. In some cases, this approach may enable them to evade DLP
solutions when sending sensitive data beyond the organization’s perimeter.
The archives created were sent to one of the stage one malware CnC servers,
which are located in different countries of the world. In most cases, stage one

servers perform only one function – redirecting the data received to a stage
two server that is located in China. It is worth noting that the registration data of
the stage one servers that we have seen includes the administrator’s email
address registered on a Chinese resource, 163.com.

from infected
systems

The function of saving all data redirected to the stage two server was enabled
on one of the stage one servers.
Apparently, the attackers selected files manually, as the stolen data included
files of different types from different directories. Only the files that had been
selected were uploaded to the stage one server.

Victims
We currently know of more than a dozen victims of the attack and the
investigation results indicate that this was a targeted and, one might even say,
pinpoint attack. All the victims identified are associated with the defense
industry or are public institutions.
The attack targeted industrial plants, design bureaus and research institutes,
government agencies, ministries and departments in several East European
countries (Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine), as well as Afghanistan.

About the attackers
A Chinese-speaking group is highly likely to be behind the attacks.
1.

We can see significant overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) with TA428 activity.

2. The attack analyzed used the same weaponizer, which embeds code of a
CVE-2017-11882 exploit in documents, as in earlier TA428 attacks that
targeted enterprises in Russia’s military-industrial complex.
3. Some indirect evidence also suggests a Chinese-speaking group very
likely being behind the attack. This includes:
a. the use of hacking utilities that are popular in China, such as Ladon,
b. the fact that the second stage CnC server is located in China,
c. the fact that the CnC server registration information includes an email
address in the Chinese domain 163.com specified in the
administrator’s contact data.
In the course of our research, we analyzed 59 sessions in which the attackers
connected to infected systems (importantly, these were cases where the
attackers connected to infected systems and entered commands by hand
rather than those associated with the malware running automatically). It turns

AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

out that the time of day when these sessions took place falls within the 8 am to
5 pm interval (with the exception of one case) in the GMT+8 time zone, where
China (as well as some other countries) is located.

We believe that the attack series we have identified is an extension of known
campaign described in the research of Cybereason, DrWeb, and NTTSecurity.
This is supported by numerous facts and a large amount of evidence we have
identified, from the choice of victims to matching CnC servers.
The authors of the research mentioned above attribute the attacks they
describe to the activity of Chinese-speaking APT groups, pointing to TA428 as
one of the most likely perpetrators.
An analysis of information obtained in the investigation suggests that
cyberespionage was the purpose of the attack series in question.

Conclusions
The results of our research demonstrate that spear phishing remains one of the
most relevant threats to industrial enterprises and public institutions. The
attackers used primarily known backdoor malware, as well as standard
techniques for lateral movement and antivirus solution evasion. At the same
time, they were able to penetrate dozens of enterprises and even take control
of the entire IT infrastructure, and IT security solutions of some of the
organizations attacked.

The attack series that we have discovered is not the first in the campaign and,
given that the attackers achieve a certain degree of success, we believe it is
highly likely that they will continue to conduct similar attacks in the future.
Industrial enterprises and public institutions should take extensive measures to
repel such attacks successfully.
We are not wrapping up our investigation as yet and will release information on
new findings as they appear.
If you have any questions or comments after reading this report or if you have
any additional information that is relevant to the malicious campaign described in
it, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us by sending an email
to ics-cert@kaspersky.com.

Recommendations
1.

Ensure that security software with support for centralized security policy
management is installed on all servers and workstations and keep the
antivirus databases and program modules of your security solutions upto-date.

2. Check that all security software components are enabled on all systems
and that a policy is in place which requires the administrator password to
be entered in the event of attempts to disable protection.
3. Check that Active Directory policies include restrictions on user attempts
to log in to systems. Users should be only allowed to log in to those
systems which they need to access in order to perform their job
responsibilities.
4. Restrict network connections, including VPN, to the systems on the OT
network; block connections on all those ports the use of which is not
required by the industrial process.
5. To the extent possible, limit trust relationships between the organization’s
domains and minimize the number of users with domain administrator
privileges.
6. Train employees of the enterprise to securely work with the internet
resources, and corporate communication channel such as email.
Specifically, explain the possible consequences of downloading and
executing files from unverified sources. Focus on identifying phishing
emails and on secure practices related to working with Microsoft Office
documents.

7. Use accounts with local administrator and domain administrator privileges
only when this is necessary in order to perform the job responsibilities.
8. Restrict the ability of programs to gain SeDebugPrivilege privileges
(where possible).
9. Enforce a password policy that has password complexity requirements
and requires passwords to be changed on a regular basis.
10. Consider using Managed Detection and Response class services to gain
quick access to high-level knowledge and expertise of security
professionals.
11. Use dedicated ICS security solutions. Kaspersky Industrial CyberSecurity
efficiently protects industrial endpoints and enables network monitoring
on the OT network to identify and block malicious activity.
