On iOS we have seen link shortener services pushing spam calendar files to victims’
devices.
We hope you already know that you shouldn’t click on just any URLs. You might be sent
one in a message; somebody might insert one under a social media post or you could be
provided with one on basically any website. Users or websites providing these links might
use URL shortener services. These are used to shorten long URLs, hide original domain
names, view analytics about the devices of visitors, or in some cases even monetize their
clicks.
Monetization means that when someone clicks on such a link, an advertisement, such as
the examples in Figure 1, will be displayed that will generate revenue for the person who
generated the shortened URL. The problem is that some of these link shortener services
use aggressive advertising techniques such as scareware ads: informing users their
devices are infected with dangerous malware, directing users to download dodgy apps from
the Google Play store or to participate in shady surveys, delivering adult content, offering to
start premium SMS service subscriptions, enabling browser notifications, and making
dubious offers to win prizes.
We’ve even seen link shortener services pushing “calendar” files to iOS devices and
distributing Android malware – indeed, we discovered one piece of malware we named
Android/FakeAdBlocker, which downloads and executes additional payloads (such as
banking trojans, SMS trojans, and aggressive adware) received from its C&C server.
Below we describe the iOS calendar-event-creating downloads and how to recover from
them, before spending most of the blogpost on a detailed analysis of the distribution of
Android/FakeAdBlocker and, based on our telemetry, its alarming number of detections.
This analysis is mainly focused on the functionality of the adware payload and, since it can
create spam calendar events, we have included a brief guide detailing how to automatically
remove them and uninstall Android/FakeAdBlocker from compromised devices.

Distribution
Content displayed to the victim from monetized link shorteners can differ based on the
running operating system. For instance, if a victim clicked on the same link on a Windows
device and on a mobile device, a different website would be displayed on each device.
Besides websites, they could also offer an iOS device user to download an ICS calendar
file, or an Android device user to download an Android app. Figure 2 outlines options we
have seen in the campaign analyzed here.

3/24

Figure 2. Malware distribution process

While some advertisements and Android applications served by these monetized shortened
links are legitimate, we observed that the majority lead to shady or unwanted behavior.

iOS targets
On iOS devices, besides flooding victims with unwanted ads, these websites can create
events in victims’ calendars by automatically downloading an ICS file. As the screenshots in
Figure 3 show, victims must first tap the subscribe button to spam their calendars with these
events. However, the calendar name “Click OK To Continue (sic)” is not revealing the true
content of those calendar events and only misleads the victims into tapping the Subscribe
and Done button.
These calendar events falsely inform victims that their devices are infected with malware,
hoping to induce victims to click on the embedded links, which lead to more scareware
advertisements.

Android targets
For victims on Android devices, the situation is more dangerous because these scam
websites might initially provide the victim with a malicious app to download and afterwards
proceed with visiting or downloading the actual expected content searched for by the user.
There are two scenarios for Android users that we observed during our research. In the first
one, when the victim wants to download an Android application other than from Google
Play, there is a request to enable browser notifications from that website, followed by a
request to download an application called adBLOCK app.apk. This might create the illusion
that this adBLOCK app will block displayed advertisements in the future, but the opposite is
true. This app has nothing to do with the legitimate adBLOCK application available from the
official source.
When the user taps on the download button, the browser is redirected to a different website
where the user is apparently offered an ad-blocking app named adBLOCK, but ends up
downloading Android/FakeAdBlocker. In other words, the victim’s tap or click is hijacked and
used to download a malicious application. If the victim returns to the previous page and taps
on the same download button, the correct legitimate file that the intended victim wanted is
downloaded onto the device. You can watch one of the examples in the video below.

In the second Android scenario, when the victims want to proceed with downloading the
requested file, they are shown a web page describing the steps to download and install an
application with the name Your File Is Ready To Download.apk. This name is obviously

6/24

misleading; the name of the app is trying to make the user think that what is being
downloaded is the app or a file they wanted to access. You can see the demonstration in
the video below.

https://youtu.be/iogUoGf1RxY

In both cases, a scareware advertisement or the same Android/FakeAdBlocker trojan is
delivered via a URL shortener service. Such services employ the Paid to click (PTC)
business model and act as intermediaries between customers and advertisers. The
advertiser pays for displaying ads on the PTC website, where part of that payment goes to
the party that created the shortened link. As stated on one of these link shortening websites
in the privacy policy section, these ads are via their advertising partners and they are not
responsible for delivered content or visited websites.
One of the URL shortener services states in its terms of service that users should not create
shortened links to transmit files that contain viruses, spyware, adware, trojans or other
harmful code. To the contrary, we have observed that their ad partners are doing it.

Telemetry
Based on our detection data, Android/FakeAdBlocker was spotted for the first time in
September 2019. Since then, we have been detecting it under various threat names. From
the beginning of this year till July 1st, we have seen more than 150,000 instances of this
threat being downloaded to Android devices.

Android/FakeAdBlocker analysis

After downloading and installing Android/FakeAdBlocker, the user might realize that, as
seen in Figure 6, it has a white blank icon and, in some cases, even has no app name.

9/24

Figure 6. App icon of Android/FakeAdBlocker

After its initial launch, this malware decodes a base64-encoded file with a .dat extension
that is stored in the APK’s assets. This file contains C&C server information and its internal
variables.

Figure 7. Decoded config file from APK assets

From its C&C server it will request another configuration file. This has a binary payload
embedded, which is then extracted and dynamically loaded.

Figure 8. Android/FakeAdBlocker downloads an additional payload

For most of the examples we have observed, the this payload was responsible for
displaying out-of-context ads. However, in hundreds of cases, different malicious payloads
were downloaded and executed. Based on our telemetry, the C&C server returned different
payloads based on the location of the device. The Cerberus banking trojan was

10/24

downloaded to devices in Turkey, Poland, Spain, Greece and Italy. It was disguised as
Chrome, Android Update, Adobe Flash Player, Update Android, or Google Guncelleme app
(guencelleme is Turkish for “update” so the name of the app is Google Update). In Greece
we have also seen the Ginp banking trojan being downloaded. The same malware family
variant of SMS trojan was distributed in the Middle East. Besides these trojans, Bitdefender
Labs also identified the TeaBot (also known as Anatsa) banking trojan being downloaded as
a payload by Android/FakeAdBlocker. Payloads are downloaded to external media storage
in the files subdirectory of the parent app package name using various app names. A list of
payload APK names is included in the IoCs section.
The emerging fact that the C&C server can at any time distribute different malicious
payloads makes this threat unpredictable. Since all aforementioned trojans have already
been analyzed, we will continue with the analysis of the adware payload that was
distributed to more than 99% of the victims. The adware payload bears many code
similarities with the downloader so we are classifying both in the same
Android/FakeAdBlocker malware family.
Although the payloads download in the background, the victim is informed about actions
happening on the mobile device by the activity displayed saying file is being downloaded.
Once everything is set up, the Android/FakeAdBlocker adware payload asks the victim for
permission to draw over other apps, which will later result in it creating fake notifications to
display advertisements in the foreground, and for permission to access the calendar.

After all permissions are enabled, the payload silently starts to create events in Google
Calendar for upcoming months.

Figure 12. Scareware calendar events created by malware (above) and detail (below)

It creates eighteen events happening every day, each of them lasts 10 minutes. Their
names and descriptions suggest that the victim’s smartphone is infected, user data is
exposed online or that a virus protection app is expired. Descriptions of each event include
a link that leads the victim to visit a scareware advertisement website. That website again
claims the device has been infected and offers the user to download shady cleaner
applications from Google Play.

All the event title names and their descriptions can be found the malware’s code. Here are
all scareware event texts created by the malware, verbatim. If you find one of these in your
Google Calendar, you are or were most likely a victim of this threat.

Besides flooding the calendar with scam events, Android/FakeAdBlocker also randomly
displays full screen advertisements within the mobile browser, pops up scareware
notifications and adult advertisements, and displays a Messenger-like “bubble” in the
foreground mimicking a received message with a scammy text next to it.

Clicking on any of these would lead the user to a website with further scareware content
that suggests that the victim install cleaners or virus removers from Google Play. We have
already written about similar shady apps impersonating security software in 2018.

Uninstall process
To identify and remove Android/FakeAdBlocker, including its dynamically loaded adware
payload, you need to first find it among your installed applications, by going to Settings ->
Apps. Because the malware doesn’t have an icon or an app name (see Figure 15), it should
be easy to spot. Once located, tap it once to select it and then tap on Uninstall button and
confirm the request to remove the threat.

Figure 15. Manual uninstallation of malware

How to automatically remove spam events
Uninstalling Android/FakeAdBlocker will not remove the spam events it created in your
calendar. You can remove them manually; however, it would be a tedious job. This task can
also be done automatically, using an app. During our tests we successfully removed all
these events using a free app available from the Google Play store called Calendar
Cleanup. A problem with this app is that it removes only past events. Because of that, to
remove upcoming events, temporarily change the current time and date in the settings of
the device to be the day after the last spam event created by the malware. That would
make all these events expired and Calendar Cleanup can then automatically remove them
all.
It is important to state that this app removes all events, not just the ones created by the
malware. Because of that, you should carefully select the targeted range of days.
Once the job is done, make sure to reset the current time and date.

20/24

Conclusion
Based on our telemetry, it appears that many users tend to download Android apps from
outside of Google Play, which might lead them to download malicious apps delivered
through aggressive advertising practices that are used to generate revenue for their
authors. We identified and demonstrated this vector of distribution in the videos above.
Android/FakeAdBlocker downloads malicious payloads provided by its operator’s C&C
server; in most cases, after launch these hide themselves from user view, deliver unwanted
scareware or adult content advertisements and create spam calendar events for upcoming
months. Trusting these scareware ads might cost their victims money either by sending
premium rate SMS messages, subscribing to unnecessary services, or downloading
additional and often malicious applications. Besides these scenarios, we identified various
Android banking trojans and SMS trojans being downloaded and executed.
