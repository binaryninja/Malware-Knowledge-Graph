“Training Videos” – A Primer
• Discovered on an open server that previously hosted ITG18
infrastructure
• Desktop recordings made by the operator using free screen
recording software
• Persona accounts on AOL, Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail
• Operator demos setting up account for continuous
monitoring using an email collaboration platform
• Operator demos exfiltrating information on various web mail
platforms

We have blurred out identifying victim
and persona information in the videos
