Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities
One of the greatest threats to U.S. National Security Systems (NSS), the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and
Department of Defense (DoD) information networks is Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber activity. These networks
often undergo a full array of tactics and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors to exploit computer
networks of interest that hold sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information. Since these
techniques include exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities, it is critical that network defenders prioritize patching and
mitigation efforts.
The same process for planning the exploitation of a computer network by any sophisticated cyber actor is used by
Chinese state-sponsored hackers. They often first identify a target, gather technical information on the target, identify any
vulnerabilities associated with the target, develop or re-use an exploit for those vulnerabilities, and then launch their
exploitation operation.
This advisory provides Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) known to be recently leveraged, or scanned-for, by
Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors to enable successful hacking operations against a multitude of victim networks.
Most of the vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited to gain initial access to victim networks using products that are
directly accessible from the Internet and act as gateways to internal networks. The majority of the products are either for
remote access (T1133)1 or for external web services (T1190), and should be prioritized for immediate patching. While
some vulnerabilities have specific additional mitigations below, the following mitigations generally apply:








Keep systems and products updated and patched as soon as possible after patches are released. 2
Expect that data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before the device was patched
will not be alleviated by patching, making password changes and reviews of accounts a good practice.
Disable external management capabilities and set up an out-of-band management network.3
Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations. 4
Isolate Internet-facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce the exposure of the internal
network.5
Enable robust logging of Internet-facing services and monitor the logs for signs of compromise.6

Detailed Vulnerabilities and Mitigations
The following is a list of CVEs being actively used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, a description of the
vulnerability, and the recommended mitigations. (NOTE: The following list of CVEs is non-exhaustive of what is available
or perhaps used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, but is a list of those being operationalized by China.)
CVE Number
CVE-2019-11510

Vulnerability Description
In Pulse Secure VPNs,® 7 an unauthenticated remote
attacker can send a specially crafted URI to perform an
arbitrary file reading vulnerability. This may lead to
exposure of keys or passwords.

(Some focused on other actors)
Additional Mitigations: Note that patching does not address credentials which may have been lost prior to patches being applied.
NSA discourages the use of proprietary SSLVPN/TLSVPN protocols, which are not compliant with CNSS policy. Transition
SSLVPN/TLSVPN deployments to either IETF standard-conformant TLS for single application use cases, or to IKE/IPsec VPNs,
preferably using one of the evaluated TLS software applications or IPSec VPN gateways/clients listed on the National Information
Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Product Compliant List (PCL).

CVE Number

Vulnerability Description

Additional Mitigations: By default, the TMUI is accessible via the management interface on both the external and internal interface.
Best practice is to disable the external interface and configure an out-of-band management network. NSA released guidance for this
in the Harden Network Devices CSI (U/OO/171339-16) and the Perform Out-of-Band Network Management CSI (U/OO/169570-20).

Affects: Microsoft Windows®11 XP - 7, Microsoft Windows Server®12 2003 - 2008.
Additional Mitigations: Block TCP Port 3389 at your firewalls, especially any perimeter firewalls exposed to the internet. This port is
used by the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and will block attempts to establish a connection. Disable Remote Desktop Services if
they are not required. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce exposure to security vulnerabilities overall and is a best
practice even without the BlueKeep threat.
Enable Network Level Authentication. With NLA enabled, attackers would first have to authenticate to RDS in order to successfully
exploit the vulnerability. NLA is available on the Windows ® 7, Windows Server® 2008 and Windows Server® 2008 R2 operating

certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it
appear that the file was from a trusted, legitimate source.
Affects: Microsoft Windows® 10, Server® 2016 - 2019.
Additional Mitigations: In addition, the Windows® certificate utility (certutil) and the OpenSSL®21 utility can be used to inspect a

Additional Mitigations: After patching the system, check to make sure that no additional admin users or remote access profiles have
been added. Verify that no changes have been made to Access Control Lists.

NSA is aware that National Security Systems, Defense Industrial Base, and Department of Defense networks are
consistently scanned, targeted, and exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. NSA recommends that critical
system owners consider these actions a priority, in order to mitigate the loss of sensitive information that could impact
U.S. policies, strategies, plans, and competitive advantage. Additionally, due to the various systems and networks that
could be impacted by the information in this product outside of these sectors, NSA recommends that the CVEs above be
prioritized for action by all network defenders.
