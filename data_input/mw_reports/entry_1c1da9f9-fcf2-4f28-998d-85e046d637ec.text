REvil (short for Ransomware Evil) is a revolutionary ransomware operation. Its predecessor,
GandCrab, which was retired in early 2019, pioneered the concept of ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) for “big game hunting” campaigns (where corporate targets are selected
according to their annual turnover). REvil’s operators (also known as GoldSouthfield or
PinchySpider) continued where GandCrab left off, and thrived. This success encouraged
other ransomware strains to be distributed as a RaaS. REvil is known to have many affiliates,
many of which crossover with those of GandCrab. Password spraying, exploiting unpatched
systems, and initial access malware families – such as IcedID or Qakbot – and now supply-

chain attacks, are all methods of distributing REvil. The tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) of this group continue to evolve and it remains one of the primary threats to large
organisations.
On 2 July, reports emerged of a widespread ransomware supply-chain attack on US-based
firm Kaseya, a remote management and monitoring (RMM) tool used by multiple managed
service providers (MSPs). Kaseya warned customers to immediately shut down their VSA
server as REvil ransomware was spreading through its auto-update function. By design,
Kaseya’s RMM software gives administrators the right to install new software on multiple
systems. This mechanism was hijacked by the ransomware operators to launch REvil with
high-level privileges. Kaseya has reported that up to 60 MSPs, with as many as 1,500 client
organisations, are affected. REvil stated in a post on its darknet leaks site, Happy Blog, that
over one million systems had been encrypted, demanding a $70 million ransom in Bitcoin for
a universal decryptor.

On the cybercrime forums, the REvil RaaS is represented by a user called UNKN (or
Unknown) who recruited the first customer for the ransomware’s affiliate program in July
2019. As the ransomware’s reputation grew, by hitting larger targets in the public and private
sector and making more money, increasingly talented affiliates were brought on board.
UNKN’s interviews with journalists reveal just how successful the group has been. UNKN
claims that the group makes a profit of $100 million each year and is aiming to make at least
$1 billion.
The REvil development team is said to consist of around ten individuals with as many as 60
affiliates that perform the active deployment of the ransomware. In February 2020, REvil’s
data-theft-extortion campaign accelerated with the launch of the Happy Blog. REvil’s
notoriety increases the chances of securing a ransom payment. The group’s high-profile
leaks are frequently covered by mainstream outlets, which works as further motivation for
organisations that initially refuse to pay a ransom to engage with the threat actors.

REvil is at the top of a pyramid of around 30 other ransomware groups that perform Big
Game Hunting (BGH) campaigns. As noted above, BGH sees groups target large
organisations, from both the private and public sectors, with high annual revenues, so that
their victims’ are more likely to be able to pay multi-million dollar ransom demands. These
amounts, however, have increased significantly since 2019, peaking at a $50 million demand
from Acer (it is unknown if they paid) and securing an $11 million ransom from JBS foods,
after originally asking for $22.5 million in Bitcoin. Other significant victims targeted by REvil
over the last two years include 20 Texas local administrations, Travelex, SoftwareOne,
Quest, GSM Law, Banco Estado, Quanta, FujiFilm, Sol Oriens, Invenergy, and more recently
French Connection. [1, 2, 3, 4]

When it was first discovered in April 2019, REvil was delivered via exploiting vulnerabilities in
Oracle WebLogic web servers. Since then, the ransomware has been deployed in a number
of ways, including via malicious spam campaigns, exploit kits, and RDP brute-forcing. To
escalate privileges, REvil also exploits CVE-2018-8453, a Win32k vulnerability, which is rare
among ransomware families. REvil’s BGH campaign has been successful in leveraging
exploits for unpatched VPN products for initial access. This includes Pulse Connect Secure
(vulnerable to CVE-2019-11510) and Citrix ADC gateway (CVE-2019-19781), as well as the
BlueGate vulnerabilities affecting the Windows Remote Desktop Gateway (tracked as CVE2020-0609 and CVE-2020-0610). This is no coincidence: during the COVID-19 pandemic,
since March 2020, VPNs and RDP have become widely used, with many forced to work from
home and establish remote connections to the office. [1, 2, 3]
In the last six months, there have been several reports of REvil ransomware deployment
following an initial IcedID or Qakbot infection. IcedID and Qakbot are reportedly developed
by LunarSpider and MallardSpider, respectively. These top-tier malware developers
collaborate with affiliates and act as Access-as-a-Service brokers for several ransomware
gangs, such as Conti or RansomExx, alongside REvil. Both are currently pushed by the
Shathak botnet, operated by a group known as TA551 (also called GoldCabin). IcedID and
Qakbot both began life as banking Trojans, used for fraud and hijacking accounts. Infections
by either malware family are usually now followed by Cobalt Strike and hands-on-keyboard
activity that enables threat actors to move laterally, steal data, and encrypt target networks to
hold them to ransom. [1, 2]
The fame and profits achieved by the REvil ransomware gang inevitably attracted other
cybercriminal syndicates. C&C servers belonging to the infamous FIN7 group (also called
CarbonSpider or Carbanak) was linked by security researchers to REvil’s infrastructure,
indicating that it was likely FIN7 was an operator and affiliate. This is a burgeoning trend, as
cybercriminal APT groups shift from Point-of-Sale malware to ransomware, with the former
no longer being as profitable as it once was. This has been accelerated by the closure of
Joker’s Stash – once the largest darknet market for stolen credit cards. A vacuum was left by
its shutting down, making it harder for the carders to cash out after a heist, leading many to
turn to RaaS and BGH campaigns. [1, 2, 3]
Most updates about the REvil RaaS project come from the underground Russian-speaking
forums. Here, UNKN announces major developments to the RaaS, including technical
updates and strategies. It was on the forums that we first learned about the RaaS, the
extortion site, affiliate recruitment drives, notifications to NASDAQ, acquisition of the KPOT
stealer, the arrival of DDoS attacks, calling victims and the media, and the Linux version of
REvil. These updates are posted across multiple darknet forums where UNKN recruits
affiliates for the REvil. These adverts are a key part of the REvil operation because the RaaS
is ultimately competing with other offerings that may give their affiliates a greater split of the
ransom. [1, 2, 3]

The most recent update to REvil is the addition of a variant to encrypt Linux systems and
VMware ESXi virtual machines. In May, UNKN announced that the group was developing a
Linux version of the ransomware and one for network-attached storage (NAS) devices. The
Linux version of REvil, which also targets ESXi, has now been discovered in the wild. It is an
ELF64 executable file that includes the same configuration options utilised by the more
common Windows executable version of REvil. When executed on ESXi servers, it will run
the ESXCLI tool to list all running ESXi virtual machines and terminate them. It will then close
any open virtual machine disk (VMDK) files so that the ransomware can encrypt them.
The targeting of VMware ESXi servers has proven successful for ransomware operators and
will continue to be so while so many remain unsecured. By targeting the management
servers this way, ransomware can encrypt multiple virtual machines at once with a single
command. Here, REvil is following a trend pioneered by others. Ransomware operations
such as Babuk, RansomExx, DarkSide, and Hellokitty have all previously created Linux
encryptors to target ESXi virtual machines. [1, 2]

The REvil campaign continues to evolve. Over 260 victims have been leaked to the Happy
Blog (all of which have been recorded by the Cyjax Portal) and countless others will have
paid a ransom to prevent a listing. To evade international law enforcement, UNKN stated that
the group members never travel and claim to be “absolutely apolitical”, which is why they
have allegedly “never been contacted by any local intelligence offices” in countries in which
they operate.
UNKN also admitted to journalists that the arrests of other ransomware gangs benefit the
REvil operation. The closure of Maze ransomware, for example, saw REvil’s number of
affiliates increase. In May 2021, during the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware
attack perpetrated by the DarkSide gang, the underground cybercriminal community
announced a ban on ransomware on multiple forums. This has significantly affected REvil’s
ability to advertise as a semi-public RaaS offering. However, UNKN stated that REvil will be
moving to a closed affiliate program that can only be contacted directly. This is not the end of
the REvil RaaS, although it will undoubtedly have impacted their ability to recruit affiliates.
REvil’s latest campaign against Kaseya and its MSP customers is by far the group’s most
devastating to date. It was always likely that one of the many well-resourced ransomware
gangs would launch a widespread supply-chain attack. At the end of 2020, we saw two
similar disruptive incidents: Cl0p ransomware exploiting Accellion FTA servers and the
SolarWinds SUNBURST campaign. Targeting vulnerable software or distributing Trojanised
updates makes for a highly effective attack campaign, especially against IT service
providers. Compromising one software update can lead to thousands of victims. REvil has
shown itself to be capable of rapid evolution. Expect to hear more from them throughout
2021.
