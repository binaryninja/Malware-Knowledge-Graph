1.1

Introduction

At the end of November, Check Point Research detected a new Office malware builder
called APOMacroSploit, which was implicated in multiple malicious emails to more than 80
customers worldwide.
In our investigation, we found that this tool includes features to evade detection by Windows
Defender and is updated daily to ensure low detection rates. In this article, we reveal the
threat actors’ malicious intentions and disclose the real identity of one attacker. We reported
this information to the relevant law enforcement authorities.
The malware infection begins when the dynamic content of the attached XLS document is
enabled, and an XLM macro automatically starts downloading a Windows system command
script.
Based on the number of customers and the lowest option price for this product, we estimate
that the two main threat actors made at least $5000 in 1.5 months, just by selling the
APOMacroSploit product.
1/21

We followed multiple cases of attacks related to this tool, which we discuss here, and we
describe a popular RAT used in this campaign to control the victim’s machine remotely and
steal information.

1.2

The campaign

Figure 1: Graph of the total number of attacks
Approximately 40 different hackers are involved in this campaign, and utilize 100 different
email senders in the attacks. Overall, our telemetry reports attacks occurred in more than 30
different countries.

1.3

The malicious document

The initial malicious document our customer received was an XLS file containing an
obfuscated XLM macro called Macro 4.0. The macro is triggered automatically when the
victim opens the document, and downloads a BAT file from cutt.ly:

Figure 2: Malicious Macro4.o obfuscated

Figure 3: Malicious Macro4.0 deobfuscated
The execution of the command “attrib” enables the BAT script to hide in the victim’s machine.
We assume the reordering of the PowerShell instructions via the Start-Sleep command
(visible after deobfuscation) is seen by the attacker as another static evasion.

BAT file downloaded from cutt.ly website

At this stage of the attack, the attackers made a key mistake. The cutt[.]ly domain directly
redirects to a download server and does not perform the request on the back end. These
servers host the BAT files:
For each file, the nickname of the customer was inserted inside of the filename (the list can
be seen below).

Figure 4: hxxp://193[.]239[.]147[.]76/bat

content
Zombie99, seen in the file name, is the nickname of one of the attackers.
From this, we obtained a list of all customers’ nicknames.

Figure 5: List of customers
The BAT script file checks which Windows version the victim has and downloads fola.exe if
the version is:
Windows 10
Windows 8.1
Windows 8
Windows 7
It adds the malware location in the exclusion path of Windows Defender, bypasses UAC and
then executes the malware.

Figure 6 : Bat File
In addition, We also noticed some usage of rebrand[.]ly that redirects and download the bat
file from cdn.discordapp.com.

APOMacroSploit

4/21

When we searched for the usernames that were in the BAT file names, we found an
advertisement for a malware builder called APOMacroSploit. This is a macro exploit
generator that allows the user to create an XLS file which bypasses AVs, Windows Defender,
bypass AMSIs, Gmail and other mail phishing detection, and more.
This tool has a “WD disabler” option, which disables Windows Defender on the targeted
machine before executing the payload, and a “WD exclusion” option, which adds the file to
Windows Defender so it can bypass WD as well.
APOMacroSploit administrators justified their AV bypass claim with links from a questionable
website: avcheck[.]net. Those links allege full none-detection (FUD) from AVs [Figure 7].

Figure 7: avcheck[.]net on XLS created by the APOMacroSploit
APOMacroSploit is sold on HackForums.net by two users: Apocaliptique (Apo) and Nitrix.
We also found a Discord channel in which Nitrix is named as the tool developer and Apo is
the admin: https://discord.com/channels/764830353927569409/764832717267140629

Figure 8: Discord channel members

In this channel, both Nitrix and Apocaliptique assist buyers with how to use the tool.
Many of the customer nicknames visible on the download server were also found on the
channel.

1.6

About the actors

For each customer, Apocaliptique and Nitrix created a BAT file to use in the attack (see the
procedure description below):
This screenshot shows that not only did these hackers sell their attack tools, but they also
participated in building and hosting the malware.

Apocaliptique uses Apo Bypass YouTube channel to advertise his tool’s features.

7/21

Figure 11: Apo Bypass YouTube channel
As you can see, this YouTube channel subscribes to 55 other YouTube channels. One of
these channels, called Ntx Stevy, attracted our attention because it has only 6 subscribers,
including Apo Bypass.

Figure 12: Ntx Stevy YouTube channel
8/21

By drilling down a bit more, we found an old Skype address for the NTx Stevy channel, in the
account name there is sequence of numbers, 93160, which is associated with a French area,
Seine Saint Denis, and more specifically, Noisy-Le-Grand city.

Figure 13: Conversations inside the NTx Stevy YouTube channel
Another channel also showed us some interesting data:

Figure 14: Conversations inside the NTx & Stevy YouTube channel
But so far, there is no clear connection between Apo and Ntx Stevy.
We do, however, know that the developer of APOMacroSploit is called Nitrix.
By searching Nitrix’s conversations, we saw the following message:

Figure 15: Nitrix talking about LOL (League of Legends) on

HackForums
So here is the first link from Nitrix to NTx.

9/21

Figure 16: Nitrix tweeting his Skype account
In this screenshot, it appears that the Skype account, we found before, on the YouTube
comment, is associated with this Twitter page.
So Ntx Stevy is actually Nitrix and plays LOL (League of Legends) using the same
summoner name! Nitrix and Apo even played games together:

Figure 17: Nitrix and Apocaliptique playing LOL (League of Legends) together
Now, the link becomes clear. This channel of 6 subscribers was followed by Apo because it
belonged to his friend, developer Nitrix.
Finally, we found another Skype account (blurred in the picture) associated with Nitrix that
confirms what we already know.

10/21

Figure 18: Another

Skype account associated with Nitrix
By searching on Skype for Nitrix’s identity, we found his first name.

Figure 19: Nitrix Skype account

After digging in Nitrix Twitter account, we finally obtained his identity: he revealed his actual
name when he posted a picture of a ticket he bought for a concert in December 2014:

11/21

Figure 20: Nitrix tweet

We looked for this name on social media and found an account on Facebook, which had the
same picture. According to his Facebook account, Nitrix was indeed living in Noisy-LeGrand.

Figure 21:
Nitrix Facebook account
We tracked Nitrix LinkedIn page that shows where he studied and that he has 4 years’ worth
of experience as a software developer.

12/21

Figure 22: Nitrix LinkedIn account
Now, let’s take a look at Apo, whose nickname in HackForums.net is “Apocaliptique.” Here
we can see Apo using this nickname and responding to questions about his product:

Figure 23: Apocaliptique’s answers to potential customers on HackForums
We found out his Skype nickname: apocaliptique93.

13/21

We assume that Apocaliptique is a French resident like Nitrix. First, the language used in the
advertisement videos is French (figure 11). Moreover, the pseudo he used above is either
“apo93” or “apocaliptique93“ and as seen above, “93” is a common suffix for French citizens
living in Seine Saint Denis.

Figure 24: Apocaliptique’s Skype nickname
We also saw that he plays and sells League of Legends accounts with this nickname and
Skype name.

The Document

14/21

The attacker sent via email with variety of subjects: поръчка за доставка (delivery order in
Bulgarian),
bio tech inquiry, royal mail notification – 30/11/2020, boat inquiry.
The file names of the documents are corresponding to the email subject: spetsifikatsiya.xls,
biotech.xls, royalmail.xls, boat.xls

Malware hosted server
One of the BAT files downloads the malware from the following location:
hxxp://XXXXXXXX/royal1/helper/gd/zt/fola[.]exe. This is a Bulgarian website for medical
equipment and supplies.

Figure 27: Bulgarian website home page
The website looks legitimate and might have been hacked by the attacker to store the
malware:

1.7.3
The Malware
The malware in question is a DelphiCrypter followed by a BitRAT.
Anti-detection mechanisms
The DelphiCrypter came with a number of anti-analysis techniques that didn’t fool our
engines. Among them:
A call of RtlAddVectorizedExceptionHandler followed by a division by 0 to generate a
crash to disrupt debuggers.

Check of the BeingDebugged flag.

QueryInformationProcess call with the argument 0h1E / 0h1F to search for debuggers.

16/21

A search for the keywords « sample », « malware » or « sandbox » in the path location
of the malware. If found, the execution stops.

Search for a set of antivirus or analysis programs. If they are running, the execution
stops :

List of antiviruses and analysis programs:
Avast
Avastui.exe
Avastsvc.exe
Aswidsagent.exe
kaspersky
Avgsvc.exe
Avgui.exe
AVP

Multiple delays of the malware execution.
Persistency
A Notepad.exe injected shellcode drops a VBS file in the startup folder to ensure the
malware persistency.

Figure 29: VBS file in the startup folder

Figure 30: Content of the VBS dropped file
Then, the notepad shellcode starts the malicious ernm.exe.

Figure 31: Duplicate the malware at the persistence path

18/21

This ernm.exe malware is statically identical to fola.exe. During its execution, it compares its
path with %appdata%/Roaming/rtgb/ernm.exe. If it is equal, it unpacks itself to a BitRAT.
