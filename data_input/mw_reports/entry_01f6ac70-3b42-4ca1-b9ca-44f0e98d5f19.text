Threat Actor Profile: TA2719 Uses Colorful Lures to Deliver RATs in Local Languages

2/13

August 26, 2020 The Proofpoint Threat Research Team
In late March 2020, Proofpoint researchers began tracking a new actor with a penchant for
using NanoCore and later AsyncRAT, popular commodity remote access trojans (RATs).
Dubbed TA2719 by Proofpoint, the actor uses localized lures with colorful images that
impersonate local banks, law enforcement, and shipping services. To date, Proofpoint has
observed this actor send low volume campaigns to recipients in Austria, Chile, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United States, and
Uruguay.
Below are recent lure examples, message volume, geo targeting, and payload
details. While lures are customized for various geographies and impersonate individuals
associated with the spoofed entities, no vertical targeting has been observed. This
actor typically delivers malware via malicious attachments, though URLs linking to malicious
files were used as a delivery mechanism in early campaigns. TA2719 often relies on widely
available resources, such as commodity malware and free hosting providers, to execute their
campaigns.
Lures
Most lures observed appear to be from a real person with a connection to the spoofed
organization. Even details like the street address in the alleged sender’s signature are often
accurate. Combined with the branding, these details attempt to boost legitimacy of the
message. They could still appear legitimate to an intended recipient who chooses to search
for the sender’s name or address before opening the attached file or clicking a link in the
message.
Campaigns observed during March-May 2020 were primarily law enforcement-themed. Using
local languages and logos from local law enforcement agencies, the subject lines often
attempted to create urgency by claiming, “ขอความดวนจากสํานั กงานตํารวจแหงชาติ (Urgent

message from the Royal Thai
Police),” or “Последната полициска покана пред апсењето (The last police invitation before
the arrest)” (Figures 1, 2).

In addition to law enforcement-themed lures, some messages sent during this time spoofed
shipping notifications. One early campaign also preyed on COVID-19 fears and impersonated
the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Figure 3). This campaign was notable not only
because of the theme, but also because it leveraged both URLs and attachments to deliver
the payload. Typically, TA2719 uses attachments or URLs, but rarely a mix of both in a single
campaign.

In early June 2020, Proofpoint observed a shift away from law enforcement lures as TA2719
began to use more common bank, shipping, and purchase order lures (Figures 4, 5).

Lures continued to be bank-themed in late June, with subjects like,
“Εισερχόμενη επιταγή πληρωμής (Incoming payment notification)” (Figure 6).

As of mid-July, TA2719 shifted to exclusively using package delivery lures,
impersonating shipping companies and using subject lines like, “Your parcel from
Mrs. Garn has arrived at our office,” or “您从中国寄来的包裹已经到了我们办公室（陈先生的包
裹）”(The package you sent from China has arrived at our office (Mr. Chen's
package)” (Figure 7).

Volume
Campaign message volume has been relatively low, with a few dozen or few hundred
messages per campaign. Total monthly message volume peaked in May but has since
returned to levels closer to those observed in March and April. Since late March, Proofpoint
has observed several TA2719 campaigns per month. The message volume spike in May
was driven by fewer campaigns with over 2,000 messages each, rather than multiple smaller
campaigns seen in other months.

Targeting
Though the campaigns don’t appear to have any vertical targeting, they are carefully crafted
for specific regions. Various languages and references to legitimate local entities, such as
banks or law enforcement organizations, have been observed:

Intended recipients often have easily searchable profiles online, and TA2719 also sends to
role-based email addresses. This suggests that there is little targeting at the individual
recipient level, but that the recipient lists may be more opportunistic in nature and compiled
using basic OSINT techniques.

Delivery and Payload
From March to early July, NanoCore was distributed primarily
through emailed ISO file attachments. Several campaigns instead used URLs linking to
malicious ISO files. Finally, sometimes the actor attempted to deliver a mix of attachments and
URLs in the same email. When using URLs, ISO files were hosted on compromised
sites or file hosting services.
In mid-July, the actor pivoted from distributing NanoCore to AsyncRAT, another commodity
RAT. Like NanoCore, AsyncRAT has been advertised on forums and as of May 2020, appears
to still be under active development with new features released May 10, 2020.
Across all campaigns observed by Proofpoint, the ISO files had a generic name, such
as ‘Document.iso’ or ‘pdf.iso’. Once the user opens the ISO–which opens like any other folder
on the computer–they then must double click the malware executable file inside to run it.
The C&C hostnames and IPs used by TA2719 appear to be relatively stable, changing roughly
once per month. This actor sometimes uses free dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers for
their C&C.

Conclusion
While not the most advanced lures we’ve seen, the localization and inclusion of legitimate
street addresses and names of real individuals related to the spoofed entities demonstrate this
actor’s attention to detail. Though TA2719 does not appear to target any particular
industry, they tailor their messages to various geographies and send medium-volume
campaigns several times per month. Their use of free DDNS providers, reuse of
infrastructure, and reliance on commodity malware demonstrate the ease with which threat
actors can begin and maintain an operation.
