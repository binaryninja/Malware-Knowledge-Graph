Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

Executive Summary
In recent years, Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA), process control and
industrial manufacturing systems have increasingly relied on commercial information
technologies such as Ethernet®, TCP/IP and Windows® for both critical and non-critical
communications. While beneficial in other areas, use of these common protocols and operating
systems has resulted in significantly less isolation from the outside world for vital SCADA and
Process Control Networks (PCNs). These systems are now under risk of attack from a variety of
threats, ranging from teenage script-kiddies to skilled and determined cyber-criminals.
Unfortunately, there are few proven methods available to the asset owner or engineer to protect
these vital systems. One commonly suggested security solution is to isolate the SCADA and
PCN systems from the Internet and corporate enterprise network (EN) through the use of
firewalls, but there is little information available on exactly how these firewalls should be
deployed in terms of architectures, configuration and management. Firewalls can be complex
devices to design and deploy correctly, so guidance on how best to deploy them in the industrial
setting would be very useful.
To address this need, the UK’s National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC)
commissioned the Group for Advanced Information Technology (GAIT) at the British Columbia
Institute of Technology (BCIT) to investigate and compile the current practices in SCADA/PCN
firewall deployment. The intent was to examine the “state of the art” in firewall architectures,
deployment and management used to protect industrial control environments.
In March 2004, the research team sent out requests for information regarding the use of firewalls
in industrial settings to approximately 60 organizations and industry news lists. A total of 10
vendors, including firewall manufacturers, IT security firms and control systems manufacturers,
responded in some form. Approximately 15 industrial users from the petroleum, chemical, food,
and electrical sectors also responded. The vendor and end-user organizations were a mix of
North American and European-based firms. This information provided was in the form of
personal interviews, white papers, policy manuals, network audit reports and security product
literature. In addition, draft documents from standards organizations involved in industrial
control security were obtained. These included documents from the American Petroleum
Institute (API), the Industrial Automation Open Networking Association (IAONA), the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) and the Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society (ISA).
All collected information was summarized by the research team in terms of firewall architecture,
design, deployment and management to determine current security practises. These practices
were then analysed and scored for their likely effectiveness in the industrial control environment.
The results of this analysis indicate that there are a significant number of different solutions used
by the industry and the security effectiveness of these can vary widely. The commonly dualhomed workstations, bridges and routers are unlikely to provide suitable isolation, while two
zone architectures are marginally secure, but should be only be deployed with extreme care. In
general, architectures that allow the establishment of a Demilitarised Zones (DMZ) between the
enterprise network and SCADA/PCN network will provide the most effective security solution.

1 Introduction
In recent years, Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA), process control and
industrial manufacturing systems have increasingly relied on commercial information
technologies such as Ethernet, TCP/IP and Windows for both critical and non-critical
communications. The use of these common protocols and operating systems has made the
interfacing of industrial control equipment much easier, but there is now significantly less
isolation from the outside world. Network security problems from the enterprise network (EN)
and the world at large can be passed onto the SCADA and process control network (PCN),
putting industrial production and human safety at risk.
At the same time, the core of our information infrastructure – the Internet – has come under
increasing attack from a wide variety of sources, ranging from teenagers on a cyber joyride to
professional hackers. People in almost every country on the globe can access a network that, in
turn, is ultimately connected to networks that run critical functions throughout the world. Cyber
attacks on information networks occur regularly and can have serious consequences if they
impact connected PCN or SCADA systems. For example, in 2000 a hacker attacked a sewage
plant in Queensland, Australia, causing millions of litres of sewage to pollute a river and park in
that region1. Three years later, the Slammer Worm caused documented impacts on at least two
power generation/distribution systems2, a safety monitoring system in a nuclear reactor3 and
emergency services phone system. Future attacks could have serious consequences such as
extended disruption of critical services and even loss of life.
While the importance of protecting these critical systems is widely acknowledged, there are few
proven protection methods available to the asset owner or engineer. Certainly there are general
information security practices and standards that can offer significant guidance towards securing
the PCN, but there are also important differences that need to be considered. For example, the
goals of information technology (IT) departments can be fundamentally different from those of a
process control department. The IT world typically sees performance and data integrity as
paramount, while the industrial world sees human and plant safety as its primary responsibility.
Other documented distinctions include differences in reliability requirements, event impacts,
performance expectations, operating systems, communications protocols and system
architectures4 5. This can mean significant differences in acceptable security practice.
One commonly suggested security solution is to isolate the SCADA and PCN system from the
corporate and Internet systems through the use of firewalls. Unfortunately, while firewalls are
widely used in the traditional IT sector, their effectiveness in SCADA/PCN environments is still
in question. IT firewalls are generally unaware of SCADA/PCN protocols, may introduce
unacceptable latency into time-critical systems and face operational constraints not typical in the
IT world. To make matters worst, there is little information available on exactly how these
firewalls should be deployed in terms of architectures, configuration and management. Typical
guidance for the PCN or SCADA engineer rarely extends beyond:
“Never mix your office LAN with your industrial-control LAN. They should be separated
by a firewall, or at minimum, a bridge or router.”6

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

This type of advice misses the fact that firewalls can be complex devices that need careful
design, configuration and management if they are to be effective. For example, how should
firewall rule sets be defined between the PCN and the corporate network? Should they be strictly
based on address filtering or should protocol filtering be used as well? And if protocol filtering is
used, which protocols should be blocked and which should be allowed? Certainly each SCADA
or PCN system has unique characteristics that rule out a single definitive answer to these
questions, but some guidance on how best to deploy firewalls in the industrial setting would be
very useful.
To address this need, the UK’s National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC)
commissioned the Group for Advanced Information Technology (GAIT) at BCIT to investigate
and compile the current practices in SCADA/PCN firewall deployment. The intent was to
examine the “state of the art” in firewall architectures, deployment and management used to
protect industrial control environments. The goals of the project were to:
1. Collect available SCADA/PCN firewall deployment recommendations from equipment
vendors, users and industry standards bodies.
2. Summarise the collected firewall deployment recommendations and best practices.
3. Analyse and rate the compiled recommendations and best practices in terms of security
effectiveness and possible weaknesses.
In March 2004, the research team sent out requests for information regarding the use of firewalls
in industrial settings to approximately 60 organizations and industry news lists. A total of 10
vendors, including firewall manufacturers, IT security firms and control systems manufacturers,
responded in some form. Approximately 15 industrial users from the petroleum, chemical, food,
and electrical sectors also responded. The vendor and end-user organizations were a mix of
North American and European-based firms. The information supplied was in the form of
personal interviews, white papers, policy manuals, network audit reports and security product
literature. In addition, documents from five standards organizations involved in industrial control
security (API, IAONA, IEC, IEEE and ISA) were obtained.
This information was first summarized by the research team in terms of firewall architecture,
deployment and management to determine current security practises. These practices were then
analysed for their likely effectiveness in the industrial control environment. The results of this
summary and analysis are contained in this report.
A follow-on project will test a number of the best practices discussed in this report in a lab
setting. This will include creating a reference firewall architecture and rule set for SCADA/PCN
security and then testing it, along with a number of commercial firewalls, in terms of security
correctness and performance. Combined, these two studies hope to provide clear guidance to the
SCADA/PCN engineer and asset owner on the design and implementation of firewalls in critical
industrial environments.

2 What is a Firewall?
A firewall is a mechanism used to control and monitor traffic to and from a network for the
purpose of protecting devices on the network. It compares the traffic passing through it to a
predefined security criteria or policy, discarding messages that do not meet the policy’s
requirements. In effect, it is a filter blocking unwanted network traffic and placing limitations on
the amount and type of communication that occurs between a protected network and other
networks (such as the Internet, or another portion of a site's network). Figure 1 shows a simple
firewall protecting a personal computer (PC) and programmable logic controller (PLC) from
unwanted traffic from the Internet, while allowing requests coming into the corporate web
server.

2.1

Types of Firewalls

A firewall can come in many different designs and configurations. It can be a separate hardware
device physically connected to a network (such as the Cisco PIX® or the Symantec Security
Gateway® firewalls), a hardware/software unit with OS-based firewall capabilities (such as
'iptables' running on a Linux® server), or even a completely host-based software solution
installed directly on the workstation to be protected (such as Norton Personal Firewall® or Sygate
Personal Firewall®).
Separate hardware or hardware/software units are often referred to as network firewalls and
typically provide the most secure solution for the separation of the PCN from corporate network.
They are dedicated-function units that can be hardened to resist all but the most ingenious
assaults. In addition, network firewalls generally offer the best management options since they
are typically designed to allow remote management.
Host-based firewalls must generally accept compromises since the primary function of the host
device is not security, but workstation or server tasks such as database access or web services. As
well, host-based firewall solutions are currently only available for Windows or Unix-based
platforms and can do little to regulate traffic destined for embedded control devices, such as

February 15, 2005

PLCs, on the network. Host-based firewalls may have a place on the PCN/SCADA network,
such as in the architecture described in section 4.2, but generally they are beyond the scope of
this study. Thus with a few exceptions, this paper assumes that the PCN/SCADA firewall will be
a dedicated hardware or hardware/software solution that, through a series of rules, allows or
denies network traffic to pass on to the control network.
2.2

Classes of Firewalls

Network traffic is sent in discrete groups of bits, called a packet. Each packet typically contains a
number of separate pieces of information, including (but not limited to) items such as the:
•
•
•
•
•

Sender's identity (Source Address);
Recipient's identity (Destination Address);
Service to which the packet pertains (Port Number);
Network operation and status flags;
Actual payload of data to be delivered to the service.

A firewall, upon receiving a packet, analyses these characteristics, and determines what action to
take with the packet. It may choose to drop the packet, allow it through immediately, buffer it
momentarily to bandwidth limit a class of service or forward it to a different recipient than was
initially intended - whatever the network security policy deems is an appropriate action to take.
These decisions are based on a series of rules commonly referred to as Access Control Lists
(ACLs). Different classes of firewalls exist, each with increasingly sophisticated analysis and
action capabilities.
2.2.1 Packet Filter Firewalls
The simplest class of firewall is known as a packet filter firewall. It has a series of static rules
and uses them to take action upon received packets on an individual basis. The following sample
rules can easily be handled by a packet filter firewall:
•
•
•
•
•

Accept Domain Name Service (DNS) response packets on User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) port 53;
Block any traffic to or from Internet Protocol (IP) address 24.116.25.21;
Prevent web surfing by blocking outgoing packets from accessing Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) ports 80, 443, 3128, 8000 and 8080, unless they are directed
to the corporate intranet web server's IP address;
Drop source routed packets;
Accept TCP port 23 (telnet) traffic to a specific Distributed Control System’s (DCS)
IP address, from a specified range of IP addresses for engineering consoles.

Unfortunately, a packet filter firewall lacks the ability to understand the relationships between a
series of packets. For example, the broad rule "Accept DNS response packets on UDP port 53"
contains a serious flaw. What if no DNS query was ever issued, but a spoofed DNS "response"
packet came in instead? This simplistic firewall would accept the packet and deliver it to the

February 15, 2005

Page 6

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

"requesting" host, possibly causing it to become confused. A moderately intelligent hacker could
use these firewall weaknesses to compromise internal systems.
The advantages of packet filtering firewalls include low cost and low impact on network
performance, often because only the IP addresses and port numbers in the packet are examined.
This method is also sometimes called Static Filtering7. It is often directly deployed in layer-3
switches or routers, rather than dedicated “firewalls”.
2.2.2 Stateful Firewalls
A more sophisticated firewall, known as a stateful firewall, intelligently tracks the
interrelationships between packets allowed to flow through it. By keeping a history of accepted
packets and the state of current connections, it can accept only “anticipated” traffic. Stateful
firewall rule sets can be made conditional due to the firewall's intelligence. For example:
•
•
•

Accept DNS response packets on UDP port 53 only if they match an outgoing DNS
query with the same DNS request identification.
Allow File Transfer Protocol (FTP) data channel traffic through only after successful
control channel negotiation.
Block all incoming web traffic originating from TCP port 80 unless it is specifically
in response to a previous outgoing Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request.

These types of firewalls offer a high level of security, good performance, and transparency to
end users, but are more expensive. Due to their complex nature, they can be less secure than
simpler types of firewalls if not administered by competent personnel. This method is also
sometimes called Dynamic Packet Filtering8.
2.2.3 Application Proxy Firewalls
Application Proxy firewalls open packets at the application layer, process them based on specific
application rules, then reassemble them and forward them to the desired target device. Typically
they are designed to concentrate on a variety of application protocols (such as Telnet, FTP,
HTTP, etc.) through a single machine, but then forward the traffic to individual host computers
for each service. Instead of connecting directly to an external server, the client connects to the
proxy firewall which in turn initiates a connection to the requested external server. Depending on
the type of proxy firewall used, it is possible to configure internal clients to perform this
redirection automatically, without the user’s knowledge. Others might require that the user
connect directly to the proxy server and then initiate the connection through a specified format.9
Proxy firewalls offer some significant security features for controlling protocols that the firewall
can recognize. For example, it is possible to apply access control lists against the application
protocols, requiring users or systems to provide additional levels of authentication before access
is granted. In addition, rules sets can be created which understand specific protocols and can be
configured to block only subsections of the protocol. For example, a firewall rule for HTTP
could be created to block all inbound HTTP traffic containing scripts. By contrast, a filtering
router could either block all HTTP traffic or none, but not a subset.

February 15, 2005

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

These types of firewalls can offer a high level of security, but can also have a significant impact
on network performance. In addition, most application proxy firewalls products only support
common Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). As a
result, messages containing industrial application layer protocols such as Common Industrial
Protocol® (CIP) or MODBUS/TCP® will require the firewall to process the traffic in stateful or
packet-filter mode.10
In the past few years, most of firewalls on the market have utilized a combination of Stateful and
Application-Proxy techniques and are often referred to as hybrid firewalls.
2.2.4 Deep Packet Inspection Firewalls
The firewall market is currently moving to a fourth technique that is referred to as "deep packet
inspection" (DPI) or "application firewalling". This typically offers filtering deeper into the
application layer than the traditional application proxy and yet does not perform a full proxy on
the TCP connection. For example, DPI firewalls will be able to inspect Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP) objects in Extended Markup Language (XML) on web connections and enforce
policy on what objects are allowed/disallowed into the network. This market is still in
development.
2.3

Other Firewall Services

In addition to the core service of traffic filtering, most modern firewalls offer other networkbased security services. These may include:
1. Acting as an intrusion detection system (IDS) by either logging packets that are denied
access, recognizing network packets specifically designed to cause problems, or reporting
unusual traffic patterns.
2. Deploying “frontline” anti-virus software on a firewall. If the characteristics of infected
traffic can be formulated, such traffic can be blocked before entering the network.
3. Authentication services requiring users wishing to connect to devices on the other side of
the firewall to authenticate to the firewall using either passwords or strong two-factor
authentication methods such as public key encryption.
4. Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway services where an encrypted tunnel is set up
between firewall and remote host device.
5. Network Address Translation (NAT) where a set of IP addresses used on one side of the
firewall are mapped to a different set on the other side.
Additional services offered will depend on the particular make and model of the firewall
purchased. Obviously these additional functions can mean additional costs, increased complexity
and reduced performance. However by utilizing them, one can often significantly improve the
overall security of the PCN/SCADA network. An analysis of these types of additional security
services is beyond the scope of this document, but the reader is advised to consider them when
making any design or purchasing decisions.

3 Overall Security Goals of PCN/SCADA Firewalls
Ideally, a process control or SCADA network would be a closed system, accessible only by
trusted internal components such as the Human Machine Interface (HMI) stations and data
historians. Realistically, the need for external access from both corporate users and selected 3rd
parties exists. For example, production and maintenance management information needs to be
relayed to computers and users outside of the plant floor for management purposes, while
vendors may need to access controllers for support purposes. Implicitly this means that some
network paths exist from the outside, untrusted world to internal control components.
The goal of the firewall, simply stated, is to minimize the risk of unauthorized access (or network
traffic) to internal components on the PCN or SCADA systems. Such a risk minimization
strategy will typically include the following general objectives:
1. No direct connections from the Internet to the PCN/SCADA network and viceversa. The reasons for this are fairly obvious and include:
(a) Unsolicited inbound traffic could congest or corrupt the control network, preventing
critical messages from reaching the control devices.
(b) Invalid control messages or denial of service (DoS) attacks could be directed to
control devices causing production upsets.
(c) Outbound Internet traffic (FTP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.), even if driven from the PCN,
could congest critical control traffic. Furthermore, embedded objects (attachments,
Java® applets, ActiveX® components) received from the Internet could compromise
control workstations, allowing the control network to fall victim to remote attacks.
(d) Proprietary corporate production data could be intercepted.
2. Restricted access from the enterprise network to the control network. The enterprise
network should not be able to directly query or control a PLC or other control device at
the plant floor/SCADA level. Both physically and logically, the enterprise and process
control networks should be isolated.
3. Unrestricted (but only authorized) access from the enterprise network to shared
PCN/enterprise servers. Typically shared servers like a data historian or maintenance
database has query access to the control network and remits relevant information back to
the querying business services.
4. Secure methods for authorized remote support of control systems. Many companies
need to allow third party access to PLC/DCS/SCADA devices by the system vendors for
support purposes. Others allow for control network access to appropriate plant staff from
a remote location for emergency maintenance. Both need to be explicitly addressed in the
firewall design.

5. Secure connectivity for wireless devices (if used). Without the proper security in place,
a wireless device on a plant floor is equivalent to an open connection with the outside
world. As with an open Internet connection, any invalid or disruptive communication
messages could cause serious operational failures.
6. Well-defined rules outlining the type of traffic permitted on a network. These are
enforced via mechanisms such as access control lists (ACLs) and virtual local area
networks (VLANs). If the traffic is not expected or wanted on the PCN, it should not be
allowed to pass.
7. Monitoring of traffic attempting to enter and on the PCN. It is important to be aware
of the nature and patterns of the communications traffic attempting to enter, or on, the
PCN or SCADA network as this will often be the only indication of either an attack on
the network or a failure in the firewall strategy. Typically this is achieved through an
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and can be either embedded in the firewall or running
on an external devicei.
8. Secure connectivity for management of the firewall. Traffic for the monitoring and
management of the firewall should be over a secure communication system and from a
highly restricted set of management devices.

i

It is important to note that there are other monitoring solutions that can be used to baseline PCN traffic in addition
to, or instead of, the firewall. For example, netflow functions in routers and switches can collect traffic statistics and
can be integrated into independent anomaly detection IDS systems.

end-users resulted in eight overall architectures used to separate the PCN/SCADA network from
the enterprise network. These range from hosts with dual network interface cards to multi-tiered
combinations using firewalls, switches and routers. Each is described below, analysed in terms of
advantages and disadvantages and then rated on a scale from one (poorest) to five (best) for the
following criteria:
•
•
•

4.1

Security – the likely effectiveness of the architecture to prevent possible attacks;
Manageability –ability of the architecture to be easily and effectively managed (both
locally or remotely);
Scalability – ability of the architecture to be effectively deployed in both large and
small systems or in large numbers.

Dual-Homed Computers

One commonly proposed security solution is the installation of dual network interface cards
(NICs) in workstation or control devices requiring information access to both the enterprise and
process control networks. This technique is often referred to as dual-homing and a typical
schematic of this design is shown in Figure 2 below.

Figure 2: Network Separation Using Dual-Homed Computers

As noted in the appendix B of API Standard 1164:
“Dual homing a computer is certainly a convenient way of allowing the computer to
connect to two different networks. However, in situations where dual homing is used to
communicate between two networks that are being segregated for security reasons it
makes the computer a significant security risk.”11
In an ideally configured system, this method allows for some minimal network separation.
However, in most devices it is trivial to adjust network configuration parameters so that the

device automatically forwards packets arriving on one network over to the other network,
thereby circumventing any premise of network isolation. The fact is that dual-homed servers are
widely seen as easy targets by the hacking community. For example, the following discussion
can be found on the web by searching for the phrase “Dual-Homed Computers”:
How to get around the firewall? The juiciest targets are dual-homed machines -- that is,
boxes with two NICs connected both to the DMZ and the internal net. In theory there
should be none; in practice, users (well, power users and developers) frequently do this
so they can get their work done more quickly.12
In addition, this architecture can potentially violate the security objective of “No Direct Internet
Connections from the Process Control Network” since the dual-NIC device is a part of the PCN,
may be attached to a network with Internet access and can run typically insecure software such
as web browsers. Furthermore, if the dual-homed computer is compromised it will likely
compromise both networks. A number of process control incidents involving the Slammer worm
in January of 2003 were a result of this type of architecture. Finally, while remote management
software does exist for personal computers, the effort involved in securely and effectively
managing more than a small number of dual-homed machines can be significant.
In summary, while dual-homed computers are useful for redundancy on the same network or on
two networks within the same PCN system, their use as an enterprise/PCN segregation measure
is less than ideal. [Security = 1 Manageability = 2 Scalability = 1]
4.2

Dual-Homed Server with Personal Firewall Software

One variation on the previous architecture is the installation of host-based personal firewall
software on a single dual-homed machine (typically a data historian server), as shown in Figure 3
below. The idea is the only traffic between the PCN and enterprise network is the shared history
data and this terminates on the server anyway. Thus if you use the personal firewall to allow only
data requests from the server to the business users and then protect the server with the
inexpensive personal firewall, you will have a very inexpensive security mechanism.

The first issue with this solution is that it will only provide a mechanism to allow the sharing of
server data. If there is any other traffic that needs to traverse the PCN to EN boundary (such as
remote maintenance access to a controller) then this architecture will either completely block that
traffic or leave the PCN poorly secured. There is little opportunity for granularity in this design.
The second problem comes about if there is more than one server involved. Remote management
of most personal firewall packages is fairly limited and as a result, maintaining consistent rule
sets and management services across multiple servers becomes very time consuming. Finally,
personal firewalls can not compete with proper network firewalls in terms of system hardening,
stateful inspection, throughput or additional features like IDS. Thus, the result of this architecture
is a very inexpensive, but very limited segregation solution.
[Security = 2 Manageability = 1 Scalability = 1]
4.3

Packet Filtering Router/Layer-3 Switch between PCN and EN

A number of vendor design documents and early industry papers13 recommended the use of a
bridge, router or layer-3 switch with basic filters in place to control traffic. A typical schematic
of this design is shown in Figure 4 below. Many of these devices are effectively acting as packetfilter firewalls and, as discussed earlier, offer limited protection against any sophisticated assault.
They are effective in enforcing basic device to device rule sets, but because they lack stateful
inspection, will not prevent attacks that take advantage of techniques such as packet
fragmentation to obscure the packet contents.

This type of packet filter design is only secure if the enterprise network is known to be highly
secure in its own right and is not generally subject to attacks. On the other hand, a number of
higher end routers on the market today can be upgraded to a stateful firewall relatively
inexpensively. If this is done, then the architecture could be considered equivalent to those
discussed in Sections 4.4 or 4.6. [Security = 2 Manageability = 2 Scalability = 4].
4.4

Two-Port Firewall between PCN and EN

By introducing a simple two-port firewall between the enterprise and process control networks, a
significant security improvement can be achieved. Most firewalls on the market today offer

February 15, 2005

Page 13

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

stateful inspection for all TCP packets and application proxy services for common Internet
application layer protocols such as FTP, HTTP and SMTP. Aggressively configured, the chance
of a successful external attack on the PCN is significantly reduced. Many of the companies
interviewed for this study used this as their standard design for PCN/SCADA security.
Unfortunately two issues still remain with this design. First, on which network are the servers
shared enterprise/PCN (such as the data historian) located? If the data historian resides on the
enterprise network, a rule must exist within the firewall allowing the data historian to
communicate with the control devices on the PCN. A packet originating from a malicious or
incorrectly configured host on the enterprise network (appearing to be the data historian) would
be forwarded to individual PLCs.

Figure 5: Network Separation with Single Firewall

If the data historian resides on the process control network, a firewall rule must exist allowing
for all hosts from the enterprise to communicate with the historian. Typically, this
communication occurs as Structured Query Language (SQL) or HTTP requests and flaws in the
historian's application layer code could result in a compromised historian. Once the historian is
compromised, the remaining nodes on the process control network are vulnerable to a
worm/virus propagating or an interactive attack.
Secondly, spoofed packets can be constructed that can affect the PCN and covert data may be
able to be tunnelled in allowed protocols. For example, if HTTP packets are allowed through the
firewall then Trojan software accidentally introduced on a HMI or PCN laptop could be both
controlled by a remote entity and send data (such as captured passwords) to that entity, disguised
as legitimate traffic.
In summary, while this architecture is a significant improvement over the previous two, it
requires the opening of rule sets that allow direct communications between enterprise and
PCN/SCADA devices. This can result in possible security breaches if not very carefully designed
and monitored. [Security = 3 Manageability = 5 Scalability = 4]

4.5

Router/Firewall Combination between PCN and EN

A slightly more sophisticated design is the use of a router/firewall combination, where the router
sits in front of the firewall and offers basic packet filtering services, while the firewall handles
the more complex issues using either stateful inspection or proxy techniques. This type of design
is very popular in Internet-facing firewalls because it allows the faster router to handle the bulk
of the incoming packets, especially in the case of DoS attacks, and reduces the load on the
firewall. It also offers improved defence in depth since there are two very different devices an
attacker must bypass. Finally, simple rules in the router can prevent packets from circumventing
the firewall in complex architectures.

Figure 6: Network Separation with Firewall/Router Combination (Internet Example)

While mentioned in the occasional industrial document (and very popular in the corporate IT
world), this design appears to be rarely used in the PCN/SCADA environment. In the few
examples the study team did uncover, the routers placed in front of PCN/SCADA firewalls did
not appear to be used for security functions. [Security = 3.5 Manageability = 3 Scalability = 4]
4.6

Firewall with Demilitarized Zones between PCN and EN

A significant improvement is the use of firewalls with the ability to establish a number of
Demilitarised Zones (DMZ) between the enterprise and process control networks. Each DMZ
holds a separate "critical" component, such as the data historian, the wireless access point or
remote and third party access systems. In effect, the use of a DMZ-capable firewall allows the
creation of an intermediate network often referred to as a Process Information Network (PIN).
To create a DMZ requires that the firewall offer three or more interfaces, rather than the typical
public and private interfaces. One of the interfaces is connected to the enterprise; the second is
connected to the PCN/SCADA network and the remaining interfaces to the shared or insecure
devices such as the data historian server or wireless access points. Figure 7 illustrates a typical
DMZ firewall design in a PCN/SCADA setting.

Figure 7: Firewall with Demilitarized Zone for Shared Enterprise/PCN Devices

By placing enterprise-accessible items in the DMZ, no direct communication paths are required
from the enterprise network to the plant floor and each network effectively ends in the DMZ.
Most sophisticated firewalls can allow for multiple DMZs, and specify what type of traffic is
forwardable between zones. As above, the firewall blocks arbitrary packets from the enterprise
network from entering the PCN, but also regulates traffic from the other network zones. By
judicious use of access control lists a clear separation can be maintained between the PCN and
other networks, with very little to no traffic directly between enterprise and PCN/SCADA
networks.
The primary security risk in this type of architecture is that if a computer in the DMZ is
compromised, then it can be used to launch an attack against the PCN via application traffic
permitted from the DMZ to the PCN. This risk can be greatly reduced if a concerted effort is
made to harden and actively patch the servers in the DMZ and if the firewall rules set permit
only connections between the PCN and DMZ are initiated by PCN devices.
The concerns expressed by interviewed end users with this design were the added complexity
(one company pointed out that the multiple interfaces can increase ACL rule complexity and
increase the likelihood for errors) and the increased cost of firewalls with three or more ports.
However, the study team believes that the improved security more than offsets these
disadvantages. Several standards such as API-1164 and a number of the more sophisticated
vendor14 15 and end user documents propose this type of design.
[Security = 4 Manageability = 4.5 Scalability = 4]
4.7

Paired Firewalls between PCN and EN

A variation on the firewall with DMZ solution is to use a pair of firewalls positioned between the
enterprise and process control networks. Common servers (such as the data historian) are situated
between the firewalls in a DMZ-like network zone called either a PIN or Manufacturing
Execution System (MES) layer16. As in the architectures above, the first firewall blocks arbitrary
packets from proceeding to the process control network or the shared historians. The second
firewall can prevent unwanted traffic from a compromised server from entering the PCN or PCN
traffic from impacting the shared servers.

If firewalls from two different manufacturers are used, then this solution may offer a “defence in
depth” advantageii. It also allows process control groups and the IT groups to have clearly
separated device responsibility since each can manage a firewall on its own. In fact it is the study
team’s understanding that this design is recommended in the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) Proposal for Security Standards for this reason.
A variation on this architecture is the basis for the IEC/SC 65C/WG 13 draft for “Enterprise
Network – Control Network Interconnection Profile (ECI)17”. It, however, proposed a router for
the EN to DMZ firewall, possibly weakening the overall security. The packet filtering services
offered by the router could leave the servers inside the DMZ exposed to more sophisticated
attacks from the EN and they, if compromised, could be used as a staging point for attacks into
the PCN.
The primary disadvantage with all two firewall architectures is the increased cost and
management complexity. For environments with severe security requirements or the need for
clear management separation, this architecture has some strong advantages.
[Security = 5 Manageability = 3 Scalability = 3.5]
4.8

Firewall and VLAN-based Process Network Combinations

Thus far, the designs have treated the PCN/SCADA network as a single entity. However in many
cases there are functional areas or cells in the PCN or SCADA system where inter-area
communication is not necessary (or perhaps not wanted). Extending the above architectures by
further dividing the SCADA or PCN into a number of VLANs allows for inter-VLAN
communication that can be controlled with simple packet filters in Layer-3 switches. Below the
Layer-3 switch is a number of VLAN-capable Layer-2 switches that allow direct communication
between devices on the same VLAN, but force all inter-VLAN traffic back to the Layer-3 switch
for filtering.
ii

There is considerable debate regarding whether there is a significant advantage in using two different firewalls,
since rarely is the firewall itself compromised. Most currently observed infiltrations of PCNs are the result of either
viruses/worms through allowed services or mis-configuration of the firewall, independent of vendor.

February 15, 2005

VLANs prevent the propagation of unwanted traffic across the entire PCN from either accidental
access by PCN staff or from introduced viruses. This design also helps mitigate the "virus
introduced by a laptop on a PCN" issue. Assuming that the PCN/SCADA environment is highly
secure as a result of the other firewall(s) between it and the enterprise networks, then more
sophisticated firewalls are not required at this level.

Several major auto manufacturers utilize variations on this design. Provided that DMZs are also
used, then this architecture is very secure. Its primary disadvantages are added management
complexity and cost. [Security = 4.5 Manageability = 3 Scalability = 5]
4.9

Summary of Firewall Architectures

The eight PCN/SCADA to EN segregation architectures recorded during this survey can be
broken down into three general classifications:
1. Separation using non-firewall devices such as dual-homed workstations, bridges and
routers (Architectures 1,2 and 3)
2. Two zone firewall-based designs without a DMZ (Architectures 4 and 5)
3. Three zone firewall-based designs with a DMZ (Architectures 6, 7 and 8)
In Table 1 we have summarized our ratings of security, manageability and scalability for each of
the eight segregation architectures, while Figure 10 shows the same information in a graphical
format. It is important to note that these ratings are approximate only and are based on the
assumptions that only technologies that are widely available at the time of the report are used and
that they are deployed in typical configurations. Unusual environments, technologies or
deployments will require the reader to adjust these ratings accordingly.

In summary, it is the study team’s opinion that the non-firewall based solutions will generally not
provide suitable isolation between PCN/SCADA networks and enterprise networks. The two
zone solutions are marginally acceptable but should be only be deployed with extreme care. The
most secure, manageable and scalable PCN/EN segregation architectures should be based on a
three zone system such as those described in Sections 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8.

5 Firewall Implementation and Configuration
5.1

General Firewall Policies

Once the firewall architecture is in place, the work of determining exactly what traffic you want
to allow through the firewall begins. As Request for Comment (RFC) 2196 - Site Security
Handbook puts it:
The difficult part is establishing the criteria by which the packets are allowed or denied
access through the doors.18
Configuring the firewall to “Deny All” except for pin-holes absolutely required for business
needs is every company’s basic premise, but the reality is much more difficult. Exactly what
does “absolutely required for business” mean and what are the security impacts of allowing those
“pin-holes” through? For example, many companies considered allowing SQL traffic through the
firewall as required for business for many data historian servers. Unfortunately SQL was also the
vector for the Slammer worm. The fact is, many important protocols used in the industrial world,
such as HTTP, FTP, OPC®/DCOM®, EtherNet/IP™ and MODBUS/TCP, are significant security
risks.
If one is installing a single two-port firewall without a DMZ for shared servers (i.e. the
architecture described in Section 4.4) then particular care needs to be taken with the rule design.
At a minimum, all rules should be stateful rules that are both IP address and port (application)
specific. The address portion of the rules should restrict incoming traffic to a very small set of
shared devices (e.g. the data historian) on the PCN from a controlled set of address on the
enterprise network. Allowing any IP addresses on the enterprise network to access the server
inside the PCN is not recommended. In addition, the allowed ports should be carefully restricted
to relatively secure protocols such as HTTPS. Allowing HTTP, FTP or any unencrypted SCADA
protocol to cross the firewall is a security risk due to the potential for traffic sniffing and
modification.
On the other hand, if the DMZ architecture is being used, then it is possible to configure the
system so that no traffic will go directly between enterprise and PCN/SCADA networks. With a
few special exceptions (noted below) all traffic from either side can terminate at the servers in
the DMZ. This allows more flexibility in the protocols allowed through the firewall. For
example, MODBUS/TCP might be used to communicate from the PLCs to the Data Historian,
while HTTP might be used for communication between the historian and enterprise clients. Both
protocols are inherently insecure, yet in this case they can be used safely as neither actually
crosses between enterprise and PCN.
An extension to this concept is the idea of using “disjoint” protocols in all PCN-enterprise
communications. That is, if a protocol is allowed between the PCN and DMZ then it is explicitly
NOT allowed between DMZ and enterprise networks. This design greatly reduces the chance of
a worm such as Slammer actually making its way into the PCN/SCADA network since the worm
would have to deploy two different exploits over two different protocols.

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

One area of considerable variation in practice is the control of outbound traffic from the PCN.
While some organizations seem to have a very open attitude towards this type of traffic, the
study team believes this traffic to represent a significant risk if unmanaged. One example, noted
earlier in Section 4.3, is trojan software that uses HTTP tunnelling to exploit poorly defined outbound rules. Thus it is important that outbound rules be as stringent as inbound rules. AppendixA of ISA’s SP-99 Technical Report #2 contains some example guidelines that help clarify this. A
summary of these follows:19
1. Outbound traffic through the PCN firewall should be limited to essential communications
only;
2. All outbound traffic from the PCN to the enterprise network will be source and
destination restricted by service and port using static firewall rules;
3. Mapped drives across the PCN firewall should be avoided.
In addition to these rules, the firewall should be configured with outbound filtering to stop forged
IP packets from leaving the PCN/SCADA network or the DMZ. In practice this is achieved by
checking the source IP addresses of outgoing packets against the firewall’s respective network
interface address. The intent is to prevent the PCN network from being the source of spoofed
(i.e. forged) communications which are often used in DoS Attacks. Thus the firewalls should be
configured to forward IP packets only if those packets have a correct source IP address for the
PCN/SCADA or DMZ networks20.
Finally, the question of PCN/SCADA connection and communication with the Internet elicits a
wide variety of practices. For example, API -1164 states:
“Internet connections should not terminate directly into the SCADA network. A firewall
should be used to isolate the SCADA network from the Internet.”21
In contrast, one of the end-user documents states:
“PCNs shall not be directly connected to the Internet, even if protected via a firewall”.
While there will be special situations (such as access for remote support) that might support the
first rule, we believe that the second is far more secure and should be the goal. Either way,
Internet access by devices on the PCN should be strongly discouraged.
In summary, the study team believes that the following should be considered as recommended
practice for general firewall rule sets:
1. The base rule set should be DENY ALL, PERMIT NONE.
2. Ports and services between the PCN environment and an external network should be
enabled and permissions granted on a specific case by case basis. There should be a
documented business justification with risk analysis and a responsible person for each
permitted incoming or outgoing data flow22.

February 15, 2005

Page 22

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

3. All “permit” rules should be both IP address and TCP/UDP port specific, and stateful if
appropriate;
4. All rules shall restrict traffic to specific IP address or range of addresses;
5. All traffic on the PCN/PIN is typically based only on routable IP protocols, either TCP/IP
or UDP/IP. Thus any non-IP protocol should be dropped;
6. Prevent traffic from transiting directly from the PCN/SCADA network to the enterprise
network. All traffic should terminate in the DMZ;
7. Any protocol allowed between the PCN and DMZ is explicitly NOT allowed between
DMZ and enterprise networks (and vice-versa);
8. All outbound traffic from the PCN to the enterprise network should be source and
destination restricted by service and port using static firewall rules;
9. Allow outbound packets from the PCN or DMZ only if those packets have a correct
source IP address assigned to the PCN or DMZ devices;
10. PCN devices should not be allowed to access the Internet.
11. PCNs shall not be directly connected to the Internet, even if protected via a firewall.
12. All firewall management traffic be either via a separate, secured management network
(e.g. out of band) or over an encrypted network with two-factor authentication. Traffic
should also be restricted by IP address to specific management stations.
The reader is cautioned that these should only be considered as guidelines. A careful assessment
of each control environment is required before implementing any firewall rule sets. Furthermore,
there will always be exceptions to these rules. For example, certain direct database to database
connections may be needed to synchronize a data historian on the PCN with a corporate-wide
database, violating suggestion #4. Similarly, time service communication to a corporate time
server may have to traverse the PCN firewall to synchronize device times on PCN. These
exceptions and how they might be addressed will be discussed in more detail in later sections of
the report.
5.2

Rules for Specific Services

Beside the general rules described above, it is difficult to outline all purpose rules for specific
protocols. The needs and best practices vary significantly between industries for any given
protocol and should be analysed on a company by company basis. The Industrial Automation
Open Networking Association (IAONA) offers a template for conducting such an analysis23,
assessing each of the protocols commonly found in industrial environments in terms of function,
security risk, worst case impact and suggested measures. Below we will summarize some of the
key points from the IAONA document, suggested practices from the ISA TR2 Appendix A and
several user policy documents. The reader is advised to consult these documents directly when
developing rule sets.

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

5.2.1 Domain Name Service (DNS)
Domain Name Service (DNS) is primarily used to translate between domain names (such as
control.com) and IP addresses (such as 192.168.1.1). Most Internet services rely heavily on
DNS, but its use on the plant floor is relatively rare at this time. In most cases there is little
reason to allow DNS requests out of the PCN to the enterprise network and no reason to allow
DNS requests into the PCN. DNS requests from the PCN to DMZ should be addressed on a case
by case basis. Local DNS or the use of host files is recommended.
5.2.2 Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol underlying web browsing services on the
Internet. Like DNS, it is critical to most Internet services. It is seeing increasing use on the plant
floor as an all purpose query tool. Unfortunately it has little inherent security and has the ability
to be a transport mechanism for a very large number of manual attacks and worms. In addition
HTTP applications are renowned for having vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
In general, HTTP should not be allowed to cross from the enterprise to the PCN. If it is, then
HTTP proxies should be configured on the firewall to block all inbound scripts and Java
applications. Incoming HTTP connections should not be allowed into the PCN as they pose
significant security risks. If HTTP services into the PCN are absolutely required, it is
recommended that HTTPS be used instead and only to very specific devices.
5.2.3 File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) are used for
transferring files between devices. They are implemented on almost every platform including
many DCS, PLCs and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), since they are extremely well known and
use minimum processing power. Unfortunately neither protocol was created with security in
mind; in the case of FTP the login password is not encrypted and, in the case of TFTP, no login
is required at all. Furthermore, some FTP implementations have a history of buffer overflow
vulnerabilities. As a result all TFTP should be blocked while FTP should be allowed on
outbound sessions only or if secured with additional token-based two-factor authentication and
an encrypted tunnel.
5.2.4 Telnet
The Telnet protocol defines an interactive, text based communications session between a client
and a host. It is mainly used for remote login and simple control services to systems with limited
resources or to systems with limited needs for security. It is a severe security risk because all
telnet traffic, including passwords, is unencrypted and it can allow a remote individual
considerable control over a device. Thus inbound Telnet session commands from the enterprise
to the PCN should be prohibited unless secured with token-based two-factor authentication and
an encrypted tunnel. Outbound telnet sessions should be allowed only over encrypted tunnels to
specific devices.

Page 24

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

5.2.5 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the primary email transfer protocol on the
Internet. Email messages are notorious for containing viruses so inbound e-mail should not be
allowed to any PCN device. Outbound SMTP mail messages from the PCN to the enterprise are
acceptable.
5.2.6 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
The Simple Network Management Protocol is used to provide network management services
between a central management console and network devices such as routers, printers and PLCs.
While SNMP is an extremely useful service for maintaining a network, its security weaknesses
are infamous. Version 1 and 2 of SNMP uses unencrypted passwords to both read and configure
devices (including devices such as PLCs) and in many cases the passwords are well known and
cannot be changed. Version 3 is considerably more secure but is still limited in use. In addition,
SNMP implementations in embedded devices have been shown to be seriously flawed in many
instances. Thus SNMP commands both to and from the PCN should prohibited unless it is over a
separate, secured management network.
5.2.7 Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
The Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) is the underlying protocol for both the
popular OLE for Process Control (OPC) and ProfiNet®. It utilizes Microsoft’s Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) service which has known vulnerabilities that were the basis for the Blaster Worm
exploits. In addition, OPC (DCOM) dynamically opens a wide range of ephemeral ports (#1024
– #65535) that can be extremely difficult to filter at the firewall. This protocol should only be
allowed between PCN and DMZ networks and explicitly blocked between the DMZ and
enterprise network. Also, users are advised to restrict the port ranges used by making registry
modifications on devices using DCOM.
5.2.8 SCADA and Industrial Protocols
SCADA and industrial protocols, such as MODBUS/TCP, EtherNet/IP and DNP3, are critical
for communications to most control devices. Unfortunately, these protocols were designed
without security in mind and do not typically require any authentication to remotely execute
commands on a control device. Thus these protocols should only be allowed between the PCN
and PIN and not allowed to cross into the enterprise network.
5.3

Network Address Translation (NAT)

One of the more contentious “best practices” is whether or not to use Network Address
Translation (NAT) on the firewall. For example, from ISA SP-99 Technical Report #2:
"NAT will not be used on the PCN"24
While in an end-user firewall practices the guideline reads:
"NAT is used on the interface connecting to the (Enterprise Network)"

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

As noted in section 2.3, NAT is a service where IP addresses used on one side of the firewall can
be mapped to a different set on the other side on an as-needed basis. It was originally designed
for IP address reduction purposes so that a company with a large number of devices that
occasionally needed Internet access could get by with a smaller set of assigned Internet
addresses.
To do this, NAT relies on the premise that not every internal device is actively communicating
with external hosts at a given moment. The firewall is configured to have a limited number of
outwardly visible IP addresses. When an internal host seeks to communicate to an external host,
the firewall remaps the internal IP address and port to one of the currently unused, more limited,
public IP addresses -- effectively concentrating outgoing traffic into fewer IP addresses. The
firewall must track the state of each connection, and how each private internal IP address and
source port was remapped onto an outwardly visible IP address/port pair. When returning traffic
reaches the firewall, the mapping is reversed and the packets forwarded to the proper internal
host.
For example, a PCN-based device may need to establish a connection with an external, non-PCN
host (for instance, to send a critical alert email). NAT allows the internal IP address of the
initiating PCN host to be replaced by the firewall; subsequent return traffic packets are remapped
back to the internal IP address and sent to the appropriate PCN device. More specifically, if the
PCN is assigned the private subnet 192.168.1.xxx and the Internet network expects the device to
use the corporate assigned addresses in the range 142.232.yyy.zzz, then a NAT firewall will
substitute (and track) a 142.232.yyy.zzz source address into every outbound IP packet generated
by a PCN device.
Today NAT is often promoted as a security feature since NAT’ed traffic ends up appearing
(from an IP address perspective) as though the firewall is the initiator of the connection. NAT
has effectively camouflaged the internal host's identity by acting as an intermediary between the
internal and external hosts. If a device is not actively communicating to an external network then
no NAT mapping for that device will exist in the firewall and thus no externally routable address
is visible to the outside world. If internal devices are addressed with private addresses (as per
RFC 1918), no router should allow direct traffic to reach them from the Internet; the only way to
communicate with the internal devices is in fact through the NAT'ed connection. Of course any
device with an active connection through the firewall will be visible to the outside world.
Whether NAT is really a true security technique or just “security through obscurity" is an open
debate in the networking community. However, there is little doubt that using NAT can have
negative consequences in some certain situations. First of all, debugging a firewall or validating
a firewall's rule set as secure can be made more difficult using NAT, due to the dynamic nature
of the currently open connections and the IP address/port combinations that must be allowed to
pass back in.
Furthermore, certain protocols are specifically broken by NAT because of the lack of direct
addressing. For example, OPC requires special 3rd party tunnel software to work with NAT.
Producer-consumer protocols, such as EtherNet/IP and Foundation Fieldbus HSE®, are
particularly troublesome as NAT does not support the multicast-based traffic that these protocols
need to offer their full services.

In summary, while NAT offers some distinct advantages, its impact on the actual industrial
protocols and configuration should be assessed carefully before it is deployed.
5.4

Specific PCN Firewalls Issues

5.4.1 Data Historians
As noted earlier in this report, the existence of shared PCN/enterprise servers such as data
historians and asset management servers can have a significant impact on firewall design and
configuration. In three-zone systems the placement of these servers in a DMZ is relatively
straightforward, but in two-zone designs the issues become complex. Placing the historian on the
enterprise side of the firewall means that a number of insecure protocols, such as MODBUS/TCP
or DCOM, must be allowed through the firewall and that every control device reporting to the
historian is exposed to the enterprise side of the network. On the other hand, putting the historian
on the PCN side means other equally questionable protocols, such as HTTP or SQL, must be
allowed through the firewall and there is now a server accessible to nearly everyone in the
corporation sitting on the PCN.
In general, the best solution is to avoid two-zone systems and use a three-zone design, placing
the data collector in the PCN and the historian component in the DMZ or PIN. Even this can
prove problematic in some situations. Heavy access from the large numbers of users on the
enterprise network to a historian in the DMZ may tax the firewall’s throughput capabilities. One
suggested solution is to install two servers; one on the PCN to collect data from the control
devices and a second on the enterprise network mirroring the first server and supporting client
queries. Of course this requires a special hole to be put through the firewall to allow direct server
to server communications, but if done correctly, this poses only minor risk.
5.4.2 Remote Support Access
Another issue for PCN/SCADA firewall design is the use of 3rd party or remote access into the
PCN. Obviously any users accessing the PCN from remote networks should be required to
authenticate using an appropriately strong mechanism such as token-based authentication. While
it is possible for the controls group to set up their own remote access system with two-factor
authentication on the DMZ, in most companies it is typically more efficient to use existing
systems set up by the IT department. In this case a connection through the firewall from the IT
remote access server is needed.
Several documents suggest that remote support personnel connecting over the Internet or via
dialup modems should run the corporate VPN connection client and authenticate using the token
based two-factor authentication scheme in order to connect to the general corporate network.
Once connected there they should be required to authenticate a second time at the PCN firewall
(using two factor authentication) to gain access to the PCN network. For companies that don't
allow any control traffic traversing the enterprise network in the clear, this will require a
cascading or secondary tunnelling solution to gain access to the PCN, such as Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) VPNs inside an Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPN.

5.4.3 Multicast Traffic
Multicasting is a communication method in which a source device can send a single data
message simultaneously to a group of destination devices. As opposed to sequentially sending
the same message to each destination, the message can be sent once over a network and any host
"tuned in" to the transmission will receive it.
Most industrial producer-consumer (or publisher-subscriber) protocols operating over Ethernet,
such as EtherNet/IP and Foundation Fieldbus HSE, are IP multicast-based. The first advantage of
IP multicasting is network efficiency; by not repeating the data transmission to the multiple
destinations, a significant reduction in network load can occur. The second advantage is that the
sending host need not be concerned with knowing every IP address of every destination host
listening for the broadcast information. The third, and perhaps most important for industrial
control purposes, is a single multicast message offers far better capabilities for time
synchronization between multiple control devices than multiple unicast messages.
Multicasting in IP environments typically occurs through the use of multicast group ID's which
are mapped directly onto the class D IP address range (from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255).
Each address is considered a separate “transmission frequency”; a host listening to multicast
packets must "tune in" to the group ID (IP address) of the transmission it wishes to receive.
If the source and destinations of a multicast packet are connected with no intervening routers or
firewalls between them, the multicast transmission is relatively seamlessiii. However, if the
source and destinations are not on the same LAN, forwarding the multicast messages to a
destination becomes more complicated. To solve the problem of multicast message routing, hosts
need to join (or leave) a group by informing the multicast router on their network of the relevant
group ID through the use of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). Multicast routers
subsequently know of the members of multicast groups on their network and can decide whether
or not to forward a received multicast message onto their network. A multicast routing protocol
is also required. From a firewall administration perspective, monitoring and filtering IGMP
traffic becomes another series of rule sets to manage, adding to the complexity of the firewall.
Another firewall issue related to multicasting is the use of NAT. A NAT'ing firewall receiving a
multicast packet from an external host has no reverse mapping for which internal group ID to
send the data to. It could, if IGMP-aware, broadcast it to every group ID it knows about (one of
them will be correct!), but this could cause serious issues if an unintended control packet was
broadcast to a critical node. The safest action for the firewall to take is to drop the packet. Thus
multicasting is generally considered NAT-unfriendly.

iii

Since it's easy to set up and requires little administration, multicasting is gaining in popularity among the control
system suppliers. However, it can be extremely disruptive in some situations. At least one large end-user reported
significant problems with legitimate multicast traffic on PCNs with large VLANs and many PLCs.

6 Management of PCN/SCADA Firewalls
The firewall is a focal point for PCN/SCADA security and requires considerable resources, not
only for initial design and commissioning, but also for on-going monitoring, incident
management, upgrading and technical support. The complexity of this task should not be
underestimated, but unfortunately it often is. For example, a recent paper on firewall
configuration errors by Avishai Wool showed that even core firewalls in major corporations can
be enforcing poorly written rule sets and vulnerable to attack25. In the study the author defined
12 serious firewall configuration errors (each very general in nature) and then inspected the
firewall configurations of 27 major corporations. He found an average 7 serious errors per
firewall, with some having as many as 12 errors. The results clearly indicate the complex nature
of firewall management.
The following are some of the management tasks that should be considered when setting up a
firewall:
1. Change Management and Documentation: The configuration and rule sets in the
SCADA/PCN can have a significant impact on production and safety in most facilities.
Thus all firewall policies must be carefully documented and subject to the same change
management requirements any PLC or DCS would be subjected to.
It is recommended that all access control lists be documented and that this documentation
includes the purpose of each rule, interdependencies, and security considerations
addressed. The rules on these devices need to be reviewed regularly to ensure that the
business case for the connection is still valid and the security controls in place.
2. Monitoring of Firewall Logs and IDS: The team responsible for the firewall must
perform monitoring and associated alerting of both logs and IDS events.
3. Define an Incident Response Plan: An incident response plan defines the emergency
response process to a suspected or actual incident and defines the steps the management
team uses to address the incident. This will include possible disconnection of the PCN
from the enterprise network and the later re-engagement process. Where a full
disconnect is not practical it should define the maximum possible restrictions that can be
enabled when required.
The re-engagement process can include details of so-called ‘pinhole’ configurations
which allow temporary access to an extremely small set of trusted resources from which
information and, for instance, anti-virus measures can be picked up so that the process
control environment defences can be brought up to date prior to restoring full
connectivity.
4. Support, patches and updates: The management team should monitor the appropriate
vulnerability lists, vendor update lists and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
security alerts. Suitably qualified and authorised personnel should perform updates,
upgrades, anti-virus upgrades, user/account management and capacity monitoring on a
regular basis.

February 15, 2005

Page 29

Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control Networks

The above management services can either be provided by local staff such as the process control
or IT departments or it can be provided from a central resource, either corporate or a 3rd party.
Of the 15 companies interviewed, most of the large corporations managed their PCN firewalls
centrally, while the smaller firms managed it locally with internal resources. A suggested rule of
thumb was that central management is preferred for groups with more than 10 PCN/SCADA
firewalls.
Regardless of whether central or local management is selected, nearly all end users pointed out
the need to include control engineers as part of the team designing, implementing and
maintaining the firewall systems. In general, the people who understand and set-up firewalls well
do not know process control specifics. For example, most security experts are Internet focused
and do not know that most control systems do not use DNS in the PCN. As a result they might
assume that a DNS request is legitimate when in many cases it is an attempt to breach the
firewall or an indication of improper activity on the PCN. Creating cross-functional controls/IT
security teams is highly recommended for PCN/SCADA firewall management.

7 Special or Future Technologies
7.1

SCADA Protocol Aware Firewalls

At the present time, commercially-available firewalls are focused on traditional Internet and
corporate application layer protocols and are unaware of the existence of industrial protocols
such as MODBUS/TCP or EtherNet/IP. As a result, they can not examine or filter SCADA
packets at the application layer or offer proxy services for these protocols. What would be ideal
is a firewall that would understand the protocols well enough to allow rules that would block
certain SCADA functions. For example, a rule might allow only MODBUS read commands to
cross the firewall and drop all packets with invalid or unauthorized function codes.
While no commercial products are offered at the present time, open source MODBUS-aware
firewall extensions to the Linux kernel have been developed by Matthew Franz and Venkat
Pothamsetty of the Cisco Systems Critical Infrastructure Assurance Group (CIAG). These are
available at no charge from http://modbusfw.sourceforge.net/
7.2

Distributed Micro-Firewalls

Several researchers have proposed the idea of a distributed micro-firewall appliance that could
be installed in front of each PLC or RTU that is in need of critical protection. Each unit would be
configured with security applications specific to its purpose, while tied back to a centralized
management system. These firewall appliances would communicate over a secure channel,
further protecting both the appliance and the PLC behind it from malicious attacks. The benefit
of this approach is that it would offer a significant second layer of defence inside the PCN
firewall and would protect critical devices from internal attack.
No products of this type are currently available for the SCADA market, but a research project to
develop a prototype is currently underway at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. In
addition, Siemens has announced plans to release in late 2004 a VPN gateway that can also act as
a distributed micro-firewall.
7.3

Quality of Service (QoS)

One suggestion uncovered during this study was the use of Quality of Service (QoS) features in
network equipment as a way to ensure that DoS attacks are of limited effectiveness in PCNs.
QoS is a concept where packets are tagged with a special priority field that indicates how they
should be handled by each router or switch they encounter. The IEEE 802.1q variation of QoS is
getting some attention in the industrial setting for this reason, but is not yet widely deployed.
However, should QoS gain wide usage in the industrial world then this could be a useful tool in
the security arsenal.
It should be noted that QoS mitigation techniques need a detection mechanism (such as IDS/AV)
to be effective. The mitigation effectiveness is also increased significantly if the QoS
mechanism implemented on the device using Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR).
If the device can not inspect the traffic, then QoS is effective only if you can trust the markings

February 15, 2005

Page 31

of the packets coming into the networking device. Unfortunately, a couple of recent of worms
actually make the QoS tags high to get better propagation characteristics.
7.4

One Way Communication Paths

The concept of one-way communication paths that allow traffic out of the PCN only is discussed
in Annex G of IEEE Std 7-4.3.226, "IEEE Standard for Digital Computers in Safety Systems of
Nuclear Power Generating Stations". While this discussion appears to be designed with serial
links in mind, it is possible to create these one-way paths over IP connections using a UDP,
instead of the more well known TCP. At the present time we are unaware of any companies
deploying this technique in the field, but it shows promise for sites requiring more stringent
security than ACLs can provide.
