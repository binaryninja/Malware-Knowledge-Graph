JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - FOREWORD

March 29, 2009

Foreword
Cyber espionage is an issue whose time has come. In this second report from the Information Warfare
Monitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against
Tibetan institutions.
The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more.
The investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries.
Up to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located
at ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The
Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began,
were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to
potentially sensitive information.
But the study clearly raises more questions than it answers.
From the evidence at hand, it is not clear whether the attacker(s) really knew what they had
penetrated, or if the information was ever exploited for commercial or intelligence value.
Some may conclude that what we lay out here points definitively to China as the culprit. Certainly
Chinese cyber-espionage is a major global concern. Chinese authorities have made it clear that they
consider cyberspace a strategic domain, one which helps redress the military imbalance between
China and the rest of the world (particularly the United States). They have correctly identified
cyberspace as the strategic fulcrum upon which U.S. military and economic dominance depends.
But attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence gathering operations by
the Chinese state is wrong and misleading. Numbers can tell a different story. China is presently
the world’s largest Internet population. The sheer number of young digital natives online can more
than account for the increase in Chinese malware. With more creative people using computers, it’s
expected that China (and Chinese individuals) will account for a larger proportion of cybercrime.
Likewise, the threshold for engaging in cyber espionage is falling. Cybercrime kits are now available
online, and their use is clearly on the rise, in some cases by organized crime and other private actors.
Socially engineered malware is the most common and potent; it introduces Trojans onto a system,
and then exploits social contacts and files to propagate infections further.
Furthermore, the Internet was never built with security in mind. As institutions ranging from
governments through to businesses and individuals depend on 24-hour Internet connectivity, the
opportunities for exploiting these systems increases.

This report serves as a wake-up call. At the very least, a large percentage of high-value targets
compromised by this network demonstrate the relative ease with which a technically unsophisticated
approach can quickly be harnessed to create a very effective spynet…These are major disruptive
capabilities that the professional information security community, as well as policymakers, need to
come to terms with rapidly.

JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - SUMMARY

Summary
Trojan horse programmes and other associated malware are often cited as vectors for conducting
sophisticated computer-based espionage. Allegations of cyber espionage (computer network
exploitation) are increasingly common, but there are few case studies in the unclassified realm that
expose the inner workings of such networks.
This study reveals the existence and operational reach of a malware-based cyber espionage network
that we call GhostNet.
Between June 2008 and March 2009 the Information Warfare Monitor conducted an extensive and
exhaustive two-phase investigation focused on allegations of Chinese cyber espionage against the
Tibetan community.
We conducted field-based investigations in India, Europe and North America. In India we worked
directly with affected Tibetan organizations, including the Private Office of the Dalai Lama, the
Tibetan Government-in-Exile, and several Tibetan NGOs. In Europe and North America we worked with
Tibetan missions in London, Brussels, and New York. The fieldwork generated extensive data that
allowed us to examine Tibetan information security practices, as well as capture real-time evidence
of malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems.
During the second phase of our investigation, the data was analyzed, and led to the discovery of
insecure, web-based interfaces to four control servers. These interfaces allow attacker(s) to send
instructions to, and receive data from, compromised computers. Our research team successfully
scouted these servers, revealing a wide-ranging network of compromised computers. This extensive
network consists of at least 1,295 infected computers in 103 countries.
Significantly, close to 30% of the infected computers can be considered high-value and include the
ministries of foreign affairs of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados
and Bhutan; embassies of India, South Korea, Indonesia, Romania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan,
Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Secretariat,
SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), and the Asian Development Bank; news
organizations; and an unclassified computer located at NATO headquarters.
The GhostNet system directs infected computers to download a Trojan known as gh0st RAT that allows
attackers to gain complete, real-time control. These instances of gh0st RAT are consistently controlled
from commercial Internet access accounts located on the island of Hainan, People’s Republic of China.
Our investigation reveals that GhostNet is capable of taking full control of infected computers,
including searching and downloading specific files, and covertly operating attached devices, including
microphones and web cameras.
The vector for spreading the GhostNet infection leverages social means. Contextually relevant emails
are sent to specific targets with attached documents that are packed with exploit code and Trojan

horse programmes designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in software installed on the target’s
computer.
Once compromised, files located on infected computers may be mined for contact information,
and used to spread malware through e-mail and document attachments that appear to come from
legitimate sources, and contain legitimate documents and messages. It is therefore possible that the
large percentage of high value targets identified in our analysis of the GhostNet are coincidental,
spread by contact between individuals who previously communicated through e-mail.
Nonetheless the existence of the GhostNet network is a significant fact in and of itself. At the very
least, it demonstrates the ease by which computer-based malware can be used to build a robust, lowcost intelligence capability and infect a network of potentially high-value targets.

Key findings:
•

Documented evidence of a cyber espionage network—GhostNet—infecting at least 1,295
computers in 103 countries, of which close to 30% can be considered as high-value
diplomatic, political, economic, and military targets.

•

Documented evidence of GhostNet penetration of computer systems containing sensitive
and secret information at the private offices of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan
targets.

•

Documentation and reverse engineering of the modus operandi of the GhostNet
system—including vectors, targeting, delivery mechanisms, data retrieval and control
systems—reveals a covert, difficult-to-detect and elaborate cyber-espionage system
capable of taking full control of affected systems.

Introduction
Computer network exploitation represents the leading edge of signals intelligence in the information
age. The proliferation of computer systems throughout governments, businesses, and civic
organizations represents a boon for would-be cyber spies.
Awareness of cyber vulnerabilities, and even basic information security practices, is in its infancy, and
largely absent in most organizations outside of the classified realm. Commercial computer systems, which
represent most of the world’s installed base, are insecure. This lack of security consciousness is reflective
of the infancy of the information age. The Internet was never designed for security and, for the most part,
there has been little incentive for software manufacturers to make security a first priority in the design
and development of products, many of which are destined for consumer and/or small business use.
These challenges are present in advanced industrial societies, but are amplified many times over
in developing countries. Ownership of computers is a relative rarity among many government
departments. Where they exist, they often use grey market or pirated software. Resources are lacking
to employ properly trained computer professionals, and many staff are barely computer literate. In
this context, information security is often a distant priority.
And yet, computers in the hands of individuals or at government offices, ministries, embassies, and
civic and non-governmental organizations contain information that can be valuable. Files and e-mails
with contact information, lists of meetings and attendees, draft position papers, internal PowerPoint
presentations, organizational budgets, and lists of visitors can represent items of strategic value
to rivals and enemies. Organizations, like individuals, can be subject to identity theft, leading to
potentially serious breaches of security.

Rise of the cyber spies
Little is known of the sophistication of state-based cyber espionage capabilities, such as those of the
United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom, all considered leaders in this field. They are assumed
to be considerable as the security doctrines of these countries treat cyberspace as a strategic domain
equivalent to that of land, air, sea, and space.2
Other powers including China have made cyberspace a key pillar of their national security strategies.
China is actively developing an operational capacity in cyberspace, correctly identifying it as the
domain in which it can achieve strategic parity, if not superiority, over the military establishments
of the United States and its allies. Chinese cyber warfare doctrine is well developed, and significant
resources have been invested by the People’s Liberation Army and security services in developing
defensive and offensive capabilities.3

But the most significant actors in cyberspace are not states. The online engagements that
accompanied the recent Russia-Georgia conflict in August 20084 and Israel’s January 2009 offensive
in Gaza5 were carried out by independent attackers. The May 2007 denial of service attacks against
Estonia6 resulted in a single conviction of a Russian living in Estonia. Likewise, previous high-profile
investigations of hacking against strategic U.S. targets were never positively attributed to foreign
intelligence services7, and in many cases were the work of individuals.8
The contest in the shadows currently underway in cyberspace appears to rely largely on third parties.
In numerous instances, including case studies conducted by the Information Warfare Monitor’s sister
project, the OpenNet Initiative, third party attackers were responsible for triggering national-level
cyber events. In Kyrgyzstan (2005)9, Belarus (2006)10, during the Russia Georgia war (2008), and
Kyrgyzstan (2009), individuals and/or loose coalitions were responsible for publishing target lists
and attack tools on semi-private websites. The ensuing “cyclones in cyberspace” were sufficient to
precipitate events outside of cyberspace.11
International cooperation has for the most part focused on establishing capabilities for counteracting
the criminal use of cyberspace, and with good reason. In 2009, the FBI estimated that cybercrime is
responsible for over $10 billion worth of losses each year.12 Cybercrime is a relatively low cost, low
threshold activity. Techniques such as phishing and targeted malware are easy to construct, and the
chances of prosecution are minimal given a general lack of international coordination.
This is slowly changing as national and international authorities become more aware of the threat.
The attacks on Estonia, for example, led to the establishment of NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia.13 The International Telecommunication Union has also
established its own specialized agency, IMPACT, designed to aid intelligence sharing and tracking of

For example, a US government investigation of systematic hacking of Department of Defense networks and defence laboratories
dubbed ‘Titan Rain’ never provided conclusive evidence to substantiate allegations that the hacking was conducted at the behest of
the Chinese government. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1098961,00.html

A good example is the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ investigation. The evidence gathered by US authorities eventually led to the conviction
of an Israeli citizen, Ehud Tenebaum, although the involvement of Israeli security services was never proven. http://www.sans.org/

malicious criminal activity in cyberspace.14 Countries such as the United States, Russia and China
have also entered into bilateral agreements with allied countries and partners.

A focus on China
Recent allegations of Chinese cyber espionage largely rely on anecdotal evidence. The most common
proof provided by victims of these attacks consists of log files or malware that shows connections
being made by infected computers to IP addresses assigned to the People’s Republic of China.
This kind of evidence is circumstantial at best. Internet usage statistics suggest that focusing on
Chinese instances of information warfare is misleading.15 With 41% of the world’s Internet users
located in Asia, China alone accounts for the largest national population of Internet users—some 300
million, nearly one-fifth of the global number of users. Coupled with the rapid growth in Chinese use
of the Internet—a 1,200% increase in the period 2000-2008—this would more than account for the
rise in instances of Chinese-oriented malware.16
At the same time, however, allegations of Chinese hacking and exploitation of private and
government computer systems are persistent enough to warrant an evidence-based investigation.
This report provides such an investigation.

Outline of report
This report is divided into three parts:
Part one provides a brief introduction to the context and background to this report. We examine past
allegations of cyber espionage by China-based actors and the challenge of evidence-based research
in this field. Part one concludes with a brief description of the methods used in our two-phase
investigation.
Part two provides a detailed account of the conduct of our investigation. The findings of each phase
are presented sequentially.
Part three analyses the overall findings of the investigation, suggests alternative explanations and
assesses the implications.

PART ONE:

Context and background

JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - PART ONE

11

Context and background: Alleged Chinese operations
in cyberspace
China has been developing its cyberspace doctrine and capabilities since the late 1990s as part of its military
modernization programme. The Chinese doctrine of ‘active defence,’ which is the belief that China must be ready
to respond to aggression immediately, places an emphasis on the development of cyber warfare capabilities.
The Chinese focus on cyber capabilities as part of its strategy of national asymmetric warfare involves
deliberately developing capabilities that circumvent U.S. superiority in command-and-control warfare.
The strategy recognizes the critical importance of the cyber domain to American military and economic
power and the importance of offensive cyber operations to victory in a modern conflict with the United
States. Chinese doctrine also emphasizes the contiguity between military and non-military realms.17
In recent years, there has been an increase in allegations that China-based hackers are responsible for
high-level penetrations of computer systems in Europe, North America and Asia. Attackers originating
in China have been accused of infiltrating government computers in the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, South Korea, and Taiwan. China-based hackers have been accused of data theft from foreign
government computers and commercial and financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Defense
reports it is continuously targeted by Chinese attackers, most notably in the series of attacks since 2003
known as ‘Titan Rain,’ which targeted the Department of Defense and numerous defence companies.18
There are also allegations of attacks originating from China directed against non-governmental
organizations active in regions where China has a national interest. This includes organizations
advocating on the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan,19 Tibetan groups active in India, and the
Falun Gong. The majority of attacks involve website defacements, denial of service attacks, or virus
writing campaigns. Nationalistic and patriotic cyber-activity by Chinese nationals intensifies during
crises, such as during Sino-American or Sino-Taiwanese tensions (see below). To date none of these
attacks have been traced back to Chinese state authorities or specific individuals, although many
have benefited official Chinese policy and interests.

Applying the evidence-based approach to cyber attacks:
the challenge of attribution
Determining those responsible for cyber attacks, commonly known as the attribution problem, is
a major challenge. The Internet was never built with security as a priority. The current version of
the Internet’s address assignment system, IP V4, provides a wealth of loopholes and methods by
which a perpetrator can mask his or her real identity and location. Online identities and servers
can be cleverly hidden. Packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through
multiple servers. A clever attacker can often hijack a machine belonging to an otherwise innocent
organization and use it as a base for launching attacks.
Hand-in-hand with the problem of attribution is the difficulty of identifying motivating factors
behind a cyber attack. Many perpetrators of Internet-based attacks and exploits are individuals whose
motivation can vary from a simple profit motive through to fear of prosecution or strong emotional
feelings, including religious belief and nationalism. Many cyber attacks and exploits which seem to
benefit states may be the work of third-party actors operating under a variety of motivations. This
makes it difficult to separate the motivation of the individual from the potential motives of the
party on whose behalf the attacks have occurred, or a prospective client to which the perpetrator
is trying to market his or her wares. In either case, the challenge of identifying perpetrators and
understanding their motives gives state actors convenient plausible deniability and the ability to
officially distance themselves from attacks.
Cyber campaigns can also take on a life of their own. Even though a state might ‘seed’ a particular
campaign through tacit encouragement or the absence of sanctions or prosecutions, these campaigns
are inherently chaotic and unpredictable in scope and outcome.20 Phenomena such as spontaneous
‘cyber rioting’ can surpass the initial purposes of the cyber campaign. Low barriers to entry to this
sort of activity enable anyone with a computer and Internet connection to take part in a cyberattack.21 For the most part, governments appear to passively benefit from online manifestations of
nationalistic and patriotic fervour, although outcomes are inherently unpredictable.22
In China, the authorities most likely perceive individual attackers and their online activities as
convenient instruments of national power.23 A favourite target of Chinese hackers is Taiwanese
computer systems, especially during times of Sino-Taiwanese tensions, such as elections and

referendums.24 In April 2001, following the death of a Chinese fighter pilot after a collision with an
American spy plane near the Chinese island of Hainan, Chinese hackers began a sustained campaign
to target American computer networks. No link was made with elements of the Chinese government.25
However, governments cannot always preserve direct control over such activities; groups can maintain
their freelance and autonomous status and undertake their own cyber initiatives that may not always
attain official sanction or serve state interests.26

Targeting Tibet
Accusations of Chinese cyber war being waged against the Tibetan community have been
commonplace for the past several years. The Chinese government has been accused of orchestrating
and encouraging such activity as part of a wider strategy to crack down on dissident groups and
subversive activity.27 Earlier research has traced these attacks against Tibetan groups to IP addresses
registered in the People’s Republic of China. The attacks used malware hidden in legitimate-looking
email messages, infecting unsuspecting users’ computers and exploiting the data on it by sending it
to control servers.28
The identity of the attackers has never been attributed in a conclusive manner to any specific group
or individual.29 The motivation of those behind the attacks, despite conjecture, is also unproven.
In earlier studies, researchers focused on attacks specifically targeting the Tibetan community.
But a wide variety of other victims of computer penetrations have reported infections similar to
those used against Tibetan organizations, following a similar modus operandi and also reporting
to control servers usually located in China. These additional targets include the Falun Gong30, the
U.S. Government, and multinational corporations.31 While reports of these targeted attacks have
circulated, the extent to which attackers successfully exploited the affected computers is unknown.

Attribution for previous penetrations of Tibetan groups has never been publicly attributed and is not available from open sources.
Classified studies may reveal a finer grained detail, as many of the attacks are relatively unsophisticated, and given proper assets,
could be traced back to specific locations and presumably individuals.

Research by Maarten Van Horenbeeck shows that similar attacks have targeted the Falun Gong. http://www.daemon.be/

Conduct of the investigation
From June 2008 to March 2009 the Information Warfare Monitor conducted an in-depth investigation
of alleged cyber espionage against the Tibetan community. We chose this case study because of the
unprecedented access that we were granted to Tibetan institutions through one of our researchers, and
persistent allegations that confidential information on secure computers was somehow being compromised.
Our lead field investigator had a long history of working with the Tibetan community, and was able
to work with the private office of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, and a number of
Tibetan non-governmental organizations.
The investigation consisted of two distinct phases.
Phase 1: Field-based investigations in India, Europe, and North America (June-November 2008)
Field research was carried out in Dharamsala, India, the location of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.
Follow-up research was conducted at Tibetan missions abroad in London, Brussels and New York. During
this phase we had unprecedented access to the Tibetan government and other Tibetan organizations.
This allowed us to establish a baseline understanding of information security practices at these
locations and to design an evidence-based approach to the investigation.
We also conducted extensive on-site interviews with officials in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, the
private office of the Dalai Lama, and Tibetan non-governmental organizations. The interviews focused on
the allegations of cyber espionage. We also sought alternative explanations for leakage of confidential
documents and information and examined basic information security practices at these locations.
Network monitoring software was installed on various computers so as to collect forensic technical
data from affected computer systems, and initial results were analysed in situ.32 This initial analysis
confirmed the existence of malware and the transfer of information between infected computers and
a number of control servers.33
Phase 2: Computer-based scouting, target selection, and data analysis (December 2008-March 2009)
During the second phase of the investigation, researchers based at the Citizen Lab analysed the data
collected by the field team.
The data collected in Dharamsala and at Tibetan missions abroad led to the discovery of four control
servers and six command servers. These control servers were identified and geo-located from the captured

32

A portion of the fieldwork was carried out in conjunction with Dr. Shishir Nagaraja who spent five days in Dharamsala at the request
of IWM researchers and assisted in conducting technical tests.

33

A packet capturing program, Wireshark, was installed at each test location. All traffic from each of the affected systems was
captured in real-time, and recorded for further analysis. Compromised systems try to connect to control servers in order check-in and
report an infection. Once a connection is made, infected computers may receive instructions or additional locations from where they
are to download instructions. The Wireshark data is sufficient to analyse these connections, determine the behaviour of the attack
vector, and identify the location of control servers.

traffic using a simple IP lookup.34 The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces
were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was
actively monitored for two weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to
also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers.
The data collected during both phases was integrated in Palantir, a data visualization and analysis
tool. The Palantir platform provides a data fusion and visualization environment that enhances
analytical capabilities.

34

We looked up the associated Internet Protocol (IP) address in all five Regional Internet Registries in order to identify the country
and network to which the IP address is assigned. We then performed a reverse Domain Name System (DNS) look-up on each IP
address. DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses; reverse DNS is a system that translates an IP address
into a domain name. This can potentially provide additional information about the entity that has been assigned a particular IP
address. If we discovered a domain name, we then looked up its registration in WHOIS, which is a public database of all domain
name registrations and provides information about who registered the domain name.

Phase 1: Field investigation
We conducted our investigation in Dharamsala between July and September 2008. The initial purpose
was to gather targeted malware samples from Tibetan NGOs based in the area and to brief the Tibetan
Government-in-Exile (TGIE) on the basics of information security. This included raising end-user
awareness about social engineering and its policy implications for the secure use of information systems.
The investigator met with the Dalai Lama’s representative in Geneva, Tseten Samdup. During the
meeting, Samdup inquired about the potential threat to computer security at the Office of His
Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) in light of the targeted malware threat. Samdup requested that
the investigator perform a preliminary security review of OHHDL systems, including Dalailama.com
and the office computer network. A five day mission was scheduled in early September. Malware
was discovered on computers located in the OHHDL.
Following the discovery of malware in the OHHDL, our investigator shifted focus to the campus
network of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. We approached Thubten Samphel, a senior civil
servant in the Department for Information and International Relations, and sought permission
to run Wireshark on several key computer systems, and to access the firewall logs at the Tibetan
Computing Resource Centre. This access was readily granted.
Additional testing was carried out at a Tibetan NGO. This was done at the suggestion of Phuntsok
Dorjee, the director of a local NGO, TibTec. Dorjee suggested that we conduct testing and monitoring at
the offices of Drewla.35 As was the case at other sitesthe investigator conducted a series of interviews
with the NGO staff.

Targeted malware — previous research
In September 2002, Tibetan groups reported that they were targeted with malware originating
from servers in mainland China. They claimed that this was a coordinated attempt to disrupt their
operations and spy on their computer networks. Similar attacks have occurred since then against a
range of Tibetan non-state actors, including exile groups, human rights organizations, trade unions
and labour organizers, writers, scholars and intellectuals.
In 2005, a member of our investigating team convened a working group that coordinated the
collection and archiving of the malware, including the payloads and associated examples of social
engineering employed. Since early 2008, we have analysed every sample available to us, and
identified control servers for at least fifty incidents.
During an analysis of attacks which occurred during the 2008 Beijing Olympics we discovered
the location of a control server that was later identified as part of the network which infected a
computer in the private office of the Dalai Lama.

35

The Drewla Initiative Project is an outreach model that seeks new ways to communicate directly with citizens of the People’s
Republic of China. It relies heavily on the Internet.

18

We were able to gain access to the command interface of this control server and identify the
infected computers which reported back to this server. While were are unable to prove exactly how
the computer in the Dalai Lama’s office became infected, this case demonstrates one of the attack
vectors used by the attacker(s) behind the network of infected computers we later uncovered.36
The following steps illustrate the attack vector using the malicious document we collected, which was
configured to connect to a control server to which we later acquired access. (See Fig. 1 - p.19)
An email message arrives in the target’s inbox carrying the malware in an attachment or web link.
The attackers(s)’ objective is to get the target to open the attachment or malicious link so that the
malicious code can execute. In this case, the attacker(s) sent a carefully crafted email message which
was configured to appear as if it was sent from campaigns@freetibet.org with an attached infected
Word document named “Translation of Freedom Movement ID Book for Tibetans in Exile.doc” to entice
the recipient to open the file.37 (See Fig. 2 - p. 20)
Over time, it has been observed that the carrier emails have become more sophisticated in their
targeting and content in order to trick their recipients into believing that they are receiving
legitimate messages. This is also known as “social engineering.” It is common to see legitimate
documents recycled for such attacks or the attacker injecting their message into an ongoing group
conversation. There are also cases where it appears that content stolen from previously-infected
machines was recycled to enhance the appearance of legitimacy.
The targeted user proceeds to opens the attachment or malicious link. Once opened, the infected
file or link exploits a vulnerability on the user’s machine and installs the malware on the user’s
computer, along with a seemingly benign file. From the user’s perspective, the infected document
will often open normally, leaving the user unaware of the infection that just took place.
Only 11 of the 34 anti-virus programs provided by Virus Total38 recognized the malware embedded in
the document. Attackers often use executable packers to obfuscate their malicious code in order to
avoid detection by anti-virus software. (See Fig. 3 - p. 21)
Researchers monitoring the use of socially engineered malware attacks against the Tibetan
community have identified over eight different Trojan families in use.39 Control over some targeted
machines is maintained using the Chinese gh0st RAT (Remote Access Tool). These Trojans generally
allow for near-unrestricted access to the infected systems.

After infecting the target, the Trojan packed in the Word document performed a DNS look-up to
find its control server and then connected to that server. This Trojan attempted to connect to
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. This is one of the control servers that we later scouted and was in the same
Trojan family that infected computers in the Dalai Lama’s private office.
About 70% of the control servers behind the attacks on Tibetan organizations are located on IP
addresses assigned to China. However, servers have also been identified in the United States,
Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. The host names pointing to these servers are quite often
configured on dynamic DNS services, such as 3322.org. While these services in and of themselves
are not malicious, they are heavily used in these specific attacks.40

Information Warfare Monitor field research
In September and October 2008 the Information Warfare Monitor investigated information security
practices and alleged cyber espionage activities on the computer systems in various offices related
to the work of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan groups. The offices that we investigated were:
the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL), based in Dharamsala, India; the Tibetan
Government-in-Exile (TGIE); various Offices of Tibet (OOT) in New York City, London, Paris, Brussels,
and Geneva; and the Tibetan activist NGO, Drewla. (See Fig. 4 - p. 23)

Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
The OHHDL is the personal office of the Dalai Lama. The OHHDL provides secretarial assistance and
is responsible for all matters related to the Dalai Lama and acts on his behalf. It is worth noting
that the OHHDL’s primary responsibilities include organization of the Dalai Lama’s international
schedule, handling all diplomatic, governmental and personal correspondence, and acting as
the liaison between the Dalai Lama and officials of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile (TGIE) and
the Offices of Tibet (OOT) worldwide. Therefore the OHHDL’s computer network is continuously
transmitting and receiving extremely sensitive data.
While the Office does not have any secrets, it is essentially the hub of the Tibetan movement and
thus handles strategic, time-sensitive communications. Examples of these communications include
scheduling meetings with world leaders, and, since 2002, coordinating the negotiations between
the People’s Republic of China and Dharamsala.
On September 10, 2008, we used Wireshark to capture packets from an OHHDL computer named
xxxxxx. We chose xxxxxxx from among 23 computers on the OHHDL internal network due to
time constraints and consultations with office staff to identify the computers most likely to be
infected, such as those operated by relatively inexperienced users vulnerable to social engineering
techniques, or those handling particularly sensitive data.
An analysis of the data collected reveals that this computer was compromised by malware that was
in interactive communication with identified control servers. The infected computer connected to

four different IP addresses, each with a somewhat different method. While there are four groupings
of communications between the infected computer and the control servers, they are related such
that there appear to be two distinct families of malware. In both cases, the malware uses the
protocol for standard web traffic, HTTP, in order make the network activity appear as if it were
normal Internet browsing.
The first family of malware used HTTP connections to connect to PHP files.41 Despite connecting
to different IP addresses and requesting different files, both used the same unique key when
communicating, indicating that they are part of the same family of malware.
1) The malware made connections to a control server on IP address xxxxxxxxxxxx
using two host names, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. The IP address
xxxxxxxxx is in a range assigned to Hainan-TELECOM (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) in China. The malware used HTTP to connect to various PHP files
on the control server in order to update its status and receive instructions about where
to download commands. The commands are embedded in what appear to be image files
(e.g. JPEG).
2) The malware made connections to a control server on IP address xxxxxxxxxxx, port
8000. This IP address reverse resolved to xxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.
com.cn and is in an IP range assigned to Hainan-TELECOM (HAIFU node adsl dialup
ports) in China. The malware used HTTP POST to upload content to the control server.42
The investigation carried out in Phase 2 identified the network of control servers used in this
particular attack. The control servers we discovered include the control server used in the welldocumented instances of social malware used frequently against Tibetan targets during the 2008
Olympics in Beijing.
The second family of malware used HTTP POST to connect to a CGI43 script to communicate between
the infected computer and the control server. While their functions appear to be different, with one
malware focusing on reporting and commands and the other on document retrieval, they are likely part
of the same family of malware. In addition, the domain names used, www.lookbytheway.net and www.
macfeeresponse.org, are registered to the same person, “zhou zhaojun” (losttemp33@hotmail.com).
1) The malware made connections to a control server on IP address 221.5.250.98 using
the host name www.lookbytheway.net. The IP address 221.5.250.98 is assigned to
CNCGROUP-CQ (CNC Group CHINA169 Chongqing Province Network) in China. The
malware on the infected computer used HTTP to connect to a file in an attempt to
inform the control server of the infected computer’s status and to download commands.

41

PHP is a popular scripting language often used in web applications.

42

HTTP POST is a method often used to upload content to a web server.

43

CGI scripts are often written in the Perl programming language.

JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - PART TWO

25

In one case, the file the infected computer was requesting was not present and the
infected computer received a 404 error. However, successful connections were made
via HTTP to CGI scripts. The infected computer used HTTP POST to submit data to CGI
scripts hosted on the control server.
2) The malware made connections to a control server on 218.241.153.61 using the host name
www.macfeeresponse.org. The IP address 218.241.153.61 is assigned to BITNET (Beijing
Bitone United Networks) in Beijing, China. The malware on the infected computer used
HTTP to connect to a file to inform the control server of the infected computer’s status
and download commands. In addition, connections were made via HTTP to CGI scripts. The
infected computer used HTTP POST to submit data to CGI scripts hosted on the control
server. Connections to one CGI script appear to inform the control server of the presence of
particular documents, while connections to a second CGI script appear to cause the infected
computer to upload documents to the control server using HTTP POST.
Instances of malware that connect to control server locations www.lookbytheway.net and www.
macfeeresponse.org have been analysed by security companies.44 This network extends to a variety
of domain names including:
•

During the in situ investigation at the Dalai Lama’s private office we observed several documents
being exfiltrated from the computer network and uploaded to www.macfeeresponse.org, including
a document containing thousands of email addresses and one detailing and discussing the Dalai
Lama’s envoy’s negotiating position. (see Fig. 5 - p. 26)
Our investigators did not have access to the stolen documents for reasons of confidentiality.
However, we can assume their significance to Sino-Tibetan negotiations. One example is the fact
that GhostNet penetrated computers of organizations involved in China-TGIE negotiations.45

Tibetan Government-in-Exile (TGIE)
On September 11, 2008, Wireshark was used to capture packets from a TGIE computer xxxxxxx. An
analysis revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which sent communication to, and
received communication from, control servers.
The malware made connections to a control server on 221.10.254.248 using the host name 927.
bigwww.com. The IP address 221.10.254.248 is assigned to CNCGROUP-SC (CNC Group CHINA169
Sichuan Province Network) in China. The malware on the infected computer used HTTP to connect
to a JPEG file, which was not an image file but instead contains an IP address and port number
(124.135.97.21:8005). This IP address, 124.135.97.21, is assigned to CNCGROUP-SD (CNC Group
CHINA169 Shandong Province Network) in China.

Offices of Tibet
London
On October 1, 2008 Wireshark was used to capture packets from a computer in the London OOT. An
analysis revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which sent communication to, and
received communication from, control servers.
The malware made connections to a control server on 58.141.132.66 using the hostname oyd.3322.
org on port 4501. The IP address 58.141.132.66 is assigned to NamBu TV in Seoul, South Korea. 3322.
org is a Chinese dynamic domain service.
New York
On March 3, 2008, Wireshark was used to capture packets from a computer in the New York OOT.
An analysis revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which attempted to send
communication to a control server.
The malware attempted to make a connection to what appears to be a control server at
125.108.172.81 but there was not an active server at that location. The IP address 125.108.172.81 is
assigned to CHINANET-ZJ-WZ (CHINANET-ZJ Wenzhou node network) in China.

Drewla
Following the discovery of targeted malware on the OHHDL, TGIE and OOT networks, we performed
similar analysis on Tibetan NGOs to see if we could identify more infected machines communicating
with control servers in China. While we carried out such analysis on a number of NGOs, in this report
we focus on Drewla’s network.
The Drewla (‘connection’ in Tibetan) is an online outreach project was set up in 2005 that employs
Tibetan youth with Chinese language skills to chat with people in mainland China and in the
diaspora, raising awareness about the Tibetan situation, sharing the Dalai Lama’s teachings, and
supplying information on how to circumvent Chinese government censorship on the Internet.
On September 12, 2008 Wireshark was used to capture packets from a Drewla computer. An analysis
revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which sent communication to, and

JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - PART TWO

28

received communication from, control servers.
The malware made connections to a control server on 221.5.250.98 using the host name www.
lookbytheway.net. The IP address 221.5.250.98 is assigned to CNCGROUP-CQ (CNC Group CHINA169
Chongqing Province Network) in China. The malware on the infected computer used HTTP to connect
to a file in an attempt to inform the control server of the infected computer’s status and download
commands. The infected computer used HTTP POST to submit data to CGI scripts hosted on the
control server. (see Fig. 6 - p. 29)
Box 1.
Chinese Internet SIGINT in practice

During the course of our research, we were informed of the following incident. A member of
Drewla, a young woman, decided to return to her family village in Tibet after working for two
years for Drewla. She was arrested at the Nepalese-Tibetan border and taken to a detention
facility, where she was held incommunicado for two months. She was interrogated by Chinese
intelligence personnel about her employment in Dharamsala. She denied having been politically
active and insisted that she had gone to Dharamsala for studies. In response to this, the
intelligence officers pulled out a dossier on her activities and presented her with full transcripts
of her Internet chats over the years. They indicated that they were fully aware of, and were
monitoring, the Drewla outreach initiative and that her colleagues were not welcome to return
to Tibet. They then released her and she returned to her village.

Phase 2: Identifying command and control servers
This phase of the investigation focused on the discovery of the command and control servers. We
were able to identify and connect to the control servers used by the GhostNet by analysing the data
from the OHHDL obtained during the field investigations carried out in Phase 1. During this process
we were able to find and access web-based administration interfaces on the control server identified
from the OHHDL data. These servers contain links to other control servers as well as command
servers, and so therefore we were able to enumerate additional command and control servers.
After discovering several instances of malware on these servers, we set up a honey pot computer and
were able to identify additional malicious servers by monitoring the traffic generated by our infected
honey pot. Using the attacker(s)’ web-based administration interface, we were able to command our
honey pot computer to download gh0st RAT, one of the Trojans used by GhostNet. Eventually, our
honey pot computer established a connection to the attacker(s)’ gh0st RAT client. The attacker(s)
proceeded to execute commands on our honey pot. We were able to discover several IP addresses
within a DSL range in Hainan Island (PRC) that the attacker(s) used to communicate with computers
infected with gh0st RAT.
Finally, we were able to map out the methods and capabilities of the GhostNet by a triangulated
analysis of three sources: 1) data obtained from our collection of socially engineered emails with
backdoor attachments, 2) the captured network traffic from Tibetan targets; and, 3) data obtained by
gaining access to the command and control interface. (see Fig. 7 - p. 31)
While analysing the data collected from the infected OHHDL computer (xxxxxxx), we discovered
web-based administration interfaces to four control servers. Through some strategic guessing
concerning file paths and file names, we were able to access web interfaces to multiple control
servers. In total, we found 26 instances of the administration interface across the four servers. It
remains unclear why the attacker(s) did not secure access to the control interface. Perhaps the
attacker(s) concluded that the file paths and file names could not be easily guessed.
The control servers’ web interface contains three main components: 1) a listing of all the infected computers
that have reported to the control server; 2) an interface to issue commands to the infected computers; and
3) an interface to monitor pending commands to infected computers and their results when completed.
The commands issued to the infected computers direct the infected computer to download files
from additional command servers under the attacker(s)’ control. In some cases, these servers act as
control servers themselves; however, some appear to be used exclusively to host malicious files that
infected computers are meant to download. The attacker(s) set commands on the control servers
that instruct infected computers to download additional remote administration Trojans, such as
gh0st RAT, in order to take complete real-time control of the infected computers.
Three of the four control servers are located in three different locations in China: Hainan,
Guangdong and Sichuan. One of the control servers is located at a web-hosting company in the
United States. Five of the six command servers are located in mainland China (Hainan, Guangdong,
Sichuan and Jiangsu) and one in Hong Kong.

• xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-JS, CN
• xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-SC, CN
The data obtained from WHOIS records concerning domain name registration reveals that most
of the domains are traceable to the same individual. However, the attacker(s) could have simply
stolen the domains from someone else, or compromised the servers hosting these domains.

List of infected computers (see Fig. 8 - p. 33)
The Server List interface provides information on each computer infected by the attacker(s)’
malware, indicating the name given to the computer (by its owner/operator), its IP address, when
it was first infected, when it last called home (i.e. the control server), and how many times it
has called home. Each infected computer is assigned a unique identification number so that the
infected computer can be tracked even when its IP address changes. The page also features a link
to the Send Command interface, through which the attacker(s) sends instructions to the infected

34

computers. There is also a button at the top of the page that links to a Command Result page that
shows the status of the commands sent to the host and their results.
To corroborate our findings, there was an entry in the Server List page of the infected OHHDL
computer that we analysed during our field investigations outlined in Part One. It contained the
unique ID, the IP address, computer name, and a link to issue commands to the infected computer.

Sending commands
The Send Command link provided for each entry yields an interface that allows an attacker(s) to
send specific commands to the selected infected computer. In addition to a custom command, the
attacker(s) may choose from a menu of commands, which includes options to download binaries that
provide additional functionality (such as keystroke logging or remote administration), acquire system
information (list computer information, software and documents on the computer), or cause the
malware to become dormant. (See Fig. 9 - p. 35)
Using the Send Command interface, the attacker(s) issues instructions to the infected computers to
download malicious files that are disguised as standard image files. As mentioned above, the files
are most often hosted on additional command servers that appear to be dedicated to hosting these
infected files.46 These command servers contain a variety of files. While the exact function of each
file is not known, the file names given to them by the attacker(s) provide some indication of their
functionality. There are file names associated with the retrieval of files as well as keystroke logging.
One of the commands available to the attacker(s) instructs infected computers to download the
gh0st RAT remote administration tool, which gives the attacker(s) full, real-time control of the infected
computer. Gh0st RAT is an open source Trojan that is widely available online. It was developed by
Chinese programmers but has now been translated into English. The program allows an attacker to
create an executable file that can be repacked and disguised and used to infect and compromise a target
computer. This file can be configured to directly connect to the gh0st RAT owner or to a third location, a
control server, when it retrieves the current IP address of the gh0st RAT owner. (See Fig. 10 - p. 36)
Once the infected computer connects to the gh0st RAT owner, an entry appears in the Connection
window with some information about the infected computer. The gh0st RAT owner may then
issue commands to the infected computer. These commands include file manager, screen capture,
keylogger, remote shell, system, webcam view, audio capture, as well as the ability to force the
infected host to download and execute additional malware, such as a gh0st RAT update.
During the course of the investigation, we infected a honey pot computer with the attacker(s)’
malware. We instructed our infected computer to download the attacker(s)’ version of gh0st RAT
using the malicious network’s web-based administration interface. The gh0st RAT attempted to
connect to several *.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn IP addresses before finally successfully
connecting to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn).

In some cases the malicious image files are hosted on the control servers themselves.

The gh0st RAT tool attempts to connect to IP addresses of a DSL provider in Hainan, China:
• xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn
• xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn
• xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn
• xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn
• xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn
• xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn
After a successful connection, the attacker(s) proceed to issue commands on our infected
computer in real-time.
We found similar but unsuccessful connections to the same IP address range from some of the
infected computers we analysed and discovered that a rudimentary version of the web-based
administration interface contained only one infection from the same IP address range in Hainan.
In addition, one of the servers used to host the attacker(s)’ malicious files is a Government of
Hainan web server located in Hainan, and one of the control server interfaces we gained access
to is also located in Hainan. However, one should not rush to judgement concerning the identity
of the attacker(s) based on this location. The gh0st RAT software can be configured with a proxy
server; therefore it is possible that the attacker(s) were using a compromised system as a proxy to
hide their true location.

Command results
The Command Result page lists the commands issued through the Send Command page and the
status of those commands. Each entry in this interface shows what command was sent to the
infected computer, including the URL to the command server and the command file (the malicious
file disguised as an image). Upon the successful completion of a command, the relevant date, time,
and result are recorded. (See Fig. 11 - p. 38)
The Command Result page contains a column that displays the content sent back to the control
server from the infected computer. The command issued to retrieve this content in the Send
Command interface is labelled “Acquire System Information.” Even though we have been unable
to properly decode the content,47 the plain text values in the binary content indicate that these
entries contain information about the infected computer (CPU, memory, operating system,
programmes installed) as well as file names of documents on the computer, presumably for later
retrieval. This information is likely used to determine which targets the attacker(s) will further
exploit and control using remote administration tools such as gh0st RAT.

47

The content is base64 encoded and XORed with values we have yet to identify.

Methods and capabilities
The attacker(s) are able to exploit several infection vectors. First, they create web pages that
contain “drive by” exploit code that infects the computers of those who visit the page. Second, the
attacker(s) have also shown that they engage in spear phishing in which contextually relevant emails
are sent to targets with PDF and DOC attachments which, when executed, create back doors that
cause the infected computer to connect to a control server and await further instructions.
With each successful infection the attacker(s) may use any contextually relevant data to further
exploit the targeted community and may also impersonate the initial target in order to infect all the
targets’ contacts. Finally, the targets themselves may infect others by forwarding infected documents
to their contacts. In this way, the network of infected computers grows organically.
The first stage of infection focuses on getting targets to execute malicious code. Once infected, the target’s
computer routinely checks in with a control server in order to receive further instructions. At this stage,
the attacker(s) acquires some initial information regarding the identity of the infected computer.
Newer versions of the administration interface contain a direct link to a web service that looks up
the relevant WHOIS information about the IP address of the infected computer along with a simple
port scan. This version also does a geoIP lookup on the infected computer’s IP address and lists the
country in which the computer is located, indicating that the attacker(s) has an interest in the
geographical location of the infected computers.
The attack may also issue an acquire system information command that causes the infected computer to upload
its hardware statistics, list of programs installed, list of recent documents, and current network connections.
The attacker(s) may use this information to target the infected computer for further exploitation.
The attacker(s) directs the infected computers to download and install a remote administration
Trojan. The attacker(s) have demonstrated a preference for gh0st RAT but may choose from a variety
of Trojans. The attacker(s) simply browses to the “send command” interface and pastes in a link to
a version of gh0st RAT on a “command” server under his or her control. The next time the infected
computer checks in to the control server, it will be instructed to download and execute gh0st RAT.
Upon completion, the infected computer notifies the control server and the result appears in the
attacker(s)’ web interface.
Once gh0st RAT is installed on the target, the infected computer will periodically check a specific
location and retrieve the IP address to which it is supposed to connect. When the attacker(s)
is not available, he or she will often change this IP to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) so that the amount
of potentially suspicious external traffic is limited. When the attacker(s) is ready to receive
connections, the IP address is changed to a valid external IP address.
When the attacker(s) turns on gh0st RAT, he or she is able to see all the infected machines that have
established connections to him or her. The attacker(s) may then execute a wide variety of commands,
including file manager, screen capture, keylogger, remote shell, system, webcam view, audio capture,
as well as the ability to force the infected host to download and execute additional malware, such as
a gh0st RAT update. The attacker(s) may also secretly execute programs on the target computer.

Analysis of list of infected computers
A detailed analysis of the list of infected computers revealed an overwhelming number of unique
infections in many countries. The same malware that infected computers at the Dalai Lama’s office
and other Tibetan organizations had a much more extensive set of targets. The list of entities and
locations of those targeted was quite varied.
In total, we found 1,295 infected computers located in 103 countries. We found that we were able to
confidently—on a scale of low, medium, high—identify 397 of the 1,295 infected computers (26.7%),
and labelled each one as a high-value target. We did so because they were either significant to the
relationship between China and Tibet, Taiwan or India, or were identified as computers at foreign
embassies, diplomatic missions, government ministries, or international organizations.
Of the remaining infected computers, 536 appear to be computers on private broadband Internet
providers. The remaining IP addresses do not reverse resolve and available information on these
hosts does not allow us to make judgements regarding the identity or purpose of these computers.

Methodology
We compiled a unified and comprehensive list of infected computers from all the control servers,
as there was considerable duplication across them. There were several duplicate entries in the list
of infected computers—in some cases, the same infected computer was logged multiple times as it
was connecting from a different IP address. In other instances, multiple infected computers were
assigned different internal IP addresses and had different computer names but shared the same
external IP address. This signifies that there were multiple infected computers sharing Internet
access. Where possible, we filtered the results by unique computer name, and if no computer name
was present, we filtered by unique external IP address.48 (See Fig. 12 - p. 41)
On the surface, the names of the infected computers in the sample are provocative. There are references
to ministries of foreign affairs, foreign embassies, and other government entities. Some contains names of
officials or their positions/titles. However, we recognize that a computer name can be anything its owner
wishes, and may be completely unrelated to the location, function, or owner of that particular computer.
Therefore, in order to be more confident as to the true identity or purpose of the infected computer,
we relied on reverse DNS look-ups and each IP address’ record from the Regional Internet Registries.
Using these two pieces of information we were able to confirm the validity of the identity of several
infected computers with a high (H) degree of confidence.
In some cases the computer name associated with the infected computer is actually a domain
name or an acronym for a recognizable institution or organization. In these cases we classified our
identification of the target with either a medium (M) or low (L) level of confidence. Medium
confidence refers to instances where we have otherwise identified a related high confidence target,

48

In one case we removed 117 unique IP addresses from Mexico that appeared to belong to the same computer connecting in to the
control server from a DSL provider.

but for which we rely on the computer name for identification. Low confidence refers to instances
in which we rely solely on the computer name for identification.

Infection timeline
The earliest infected computer called home to the control server on May 22, 2007. The most recent
entry in our sample is March 12, 2009. On average, the amount of time that a host was actively
infected was 145 days.49 While 90 infected computers were only infected for one day, 145 were
infected for over 400 days. The longest infection span was 660 days. In total, 422 hosts checked in
March 1-12, 2009; 373 of these computers were infected in 2008. The data indicates that despite a
reduction in new infections, the network continues to be operational. (See Fig. 13 - p. 45)
There are significant spikes in infection rates in December 2007 and August 2008.
There were 320 infections in December 2007 spread across 56 countries. However, 113 were located
within Taiwan and the majority of these infections occurred within a single organization: the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council. During this same period, computers at the Embassies
of India in Belgium and Zimbabwe were infected as were the Embassies of Indonesia and the
Republic of Korea in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, computers at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Iran were infected as were several computers at the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.
The spike in August 2008 totalled 258 infections spread across 46 countries. The OHHDL computer
was infected during one of these spikes in August 2008 (It last checked in to the control server
in September 2008). This spike included the Chinese Embassy in the United States,50 3 computers
at the Embassy of India in the Unites States, and the High Commission of India in the United
Kingdom and in Cyprus. It also included the Embassy of Cyprus in Germany, the Embassy of
Malaysia in Cuba, the Embassy of Thailand in the Philippines and the Ministry of Industry in
Vietnam. Several companies were also compromised, including Net Trade in Taiwan, the New York
Office of Deloitte & Touche, and PetroVietnam, the government-owned oil and gas Company.

PART THREE:

Investigating GhostNet: Conclusions

JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - PART THREE

47

The evidence presented in this report—through a combination of field investigations,
interviews, technical scouting, data analysis, mining and visualization—paints a
disturbing picture.
GhostNet represents a network of compromised computers resident in high-value political,
economic, and media locations spread across numerous countries worldwide. At the time of writing,
these organizations are almost certainly oblivious to the compromised situation in which they find
themselves. The computers of diplomats, military attachés, private assistants, secretaries to Prime
Ministers, journalists and others are under the concealed control of unknown assailant(s).
In Dharamsala and elsewhere, we have witnessed machines being profiled and sensitive documents
being removed. At our Laboratory, we have analysed our own infected “honey pot” computer
and discovered that the capabilities of GhostNet are potent and wide ranging. Almost certainly,
documents are being removed without the targets’ knowledge, keystrokes logged, web cameras are
being silently triggered, and audio inputs surreptitiously activated.
This raises the question, how many sensitive activities have been preemptively anticipated by
intelligence gathered through this network? How many illegal transactions have been facilitated by
information harvested through GhostNet? Worst of all, how many people may have been put at risk?
While these questions are compelling, it would be imprudent to read these findings as an indictment,
or to attribute to the owners of GhostNet motivations and intentions for which there is no evidence.

Alternative explanations
The list of computers controlled by the GhostNet is significant, and certainly atypical for a cybercrime
network. The size of the network is small, and the concentration of high-value systems is significant.
At the same time, penetrations of this type are not uncommon. Recently, several large-scale spy
nets have been discovered, including ones containing lists of affected computers of a magnitude
higher than that harvested by GhostNet.
This trend is predictable, converging with accumulating incidents of cyber-attacks facilitated by
lower entry-thresholds for computer exploitation methods and technologies. The tools we profile in
our investigation, though apparently amassed in a complex way to achieve a definite purpose, are
not restricted to an exclusive guild of experts with specialized and confidential knowledge.
Today, pirated cyber-crime kits circulate extensively on the Internet and can be downloaded by
anyone about as easily as the latest pirated DVD.51 Cyberspace has empowered individuals and small
groups of non-state actors to do many things, including executing sophisticated computer network
operations that were previously only the domain of state intelligence agencies. We have entered
the era of do-it-yourself (DIY) signals intelligence.

Attribution
Who is ultimately in control of the GhostNet system? While our analysis reveals that numerous
politically sensitive and high-value computer systems were compromised, we do not know the
motivation or the identity of the attacker(s) or how to accurately characterize this network of
infections as a whole. We have not been able to ascertain the type of data that has been obtained
by the attacker(s), apart from the basic system information and file listings of the documents
located on the target computers. Without this data we are unable to deduce with any certainty
what kind of data the attacker(s) were after. There are thus several possibilities for attribution.
The most obvious explanation, and certainly the one in which the circumstantial evidence tilts the
strongest, would be that this set of high profile targets has been exploited by the Chinese state for
military and strategic-intelligence purposes. Indeed, as described above, many of the high confidence,
high-value targets that we identified are clearly linked to Chinese foreign and defence policy,
particularly in South and South East Asia. Like radar sweeping around the southern border of China,
there is an arc of infected nodes from India, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Vietnam, through Laos, Brunei,
Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Many of the high profile targets reflect some of China’s most
vexing foreign and security policy issues, including Tibet and Taiwan. Moreover, the attacker(s)’ IP
addresses examined here trace back in at least several instances to Hainan Island, home of the Lingshui
signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People’s Liberation Army.52
However, we must be cautious to rush to judgement in spite of circumstantial and other evidence,
as alternative explanations are certainly possible and charges against a government of this nature
are gravely serious. On the other end of the spectrum is the explanation that this is a random set
of infected computers that just happens to include high profile targets of strategic significance
to China, collected by an individual or group with no political agenda per se. Similarly one can
postulate that the targets gathered together happened less by concerted effort than by sheer
coincidence. Given the groupings of various entities in the infected computer list (by country
and organization), internal email communications and sloppy security practices could have led to
cross-infection and subsequent listing on the control servers.
Another possible explanation is that there is a single individual or set of individuals (criminal networks,
for example) who are targeting these high-value targets for profit. This can be in the form of stealing
financial information or critical data that can be sold to clients, be they states or private entities. There
are countless examples of large-scale fraud and data theft worldwide and numerous apparent instances
of outsourcing to third parties of cyber-attacks and espionage, some of which the Information Warfare
Monitor and its related research project, the OpenNet Initiative, have documented. GhostNet could very
well be a for-profit, non-state venture. Even “patriotic hackers” could be acting on their own volition,
or with the tacit approval of their government, as operators of the GhostNet.
Finally, it is not inconceivable that this network of infected computers could have been targeted
by a state other than China, but operated physically within China (and at least one node in

52

http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/lingshui.htm

JR02-2009 Tracking GhostNet - PART THREE

49

the United States) for strategic purposes. Compromised proxy computers on Hainan Island, for
example, could have been deployed as staging posts, perhaps in an effort to deliberately mislead
observers as to the true operator(s) and purpose of the GhostNet system.

The Significance of GhostNet
GhostNet is significant, as it does not appear to be a typical cybercrime network. The potential
political fallout is enormous. But ultimately, the question of who is behind the GhostNet may
matter less than the strategic significance of the collection of affected targets. What this study
discovered is serious evidence that information security is an item requiring urgent attention at
the highest levels. It demonstrates that the subterranean layers of cyberspace, about which most
users are unaware, are domains of active reconnaissance, surveillance, and exploitation.
Regardless of who or what is ultimately in control of GhostNet, its capabilities of exploitation and
the strategic intelligence that can be harvested from it matter most. Indeed, although the Achilles’
heel of the GhostNet system allowed us to monitor and document its far-reaching network of
infiltration, we can safely hypothesize that it is neither the first nor the only one of its kind.

PART FOUR:

About Information Warfare Monitor

51

About the Information Warfare Monitor
http://infowar-monitor.net/
The Information Warfare Monitor is an advanced research activity tracking the emergence of cyberspace
as a strategic domain. We are an independent research effort. Our mission is to build and broaden the
evidence base available to scholars, policymakers, and others. We aim to educate and inform.
The Information Warfare Monitor is a public-private venture between two Canadian institutions: The
SecDev Group, an operational think tank based in Ottawa (Canada), and the Citizen Lab at the Munk
Centre for International Studies, University of Toronto. The Principal Investigators and
co-founders of the Information Warfare Monitor are Rafal Rohozinski (The SecDev Group) and
Ronald Deibert (Citizen Lab).
The Information Warfare Monitor is supported by The SecDev Group which conducts field-based
investigations and data gathering. Our advanced research and analysis facilities are located at the
Citizen Lab. IWM is part of the Citizen Lab’s network of advanced research projects, which include the
OpenNet Initiative and ONI Asia.
The Information Warfare Monitor also benefits from donations from a variety of sponsors including
Psiphon Inc, and Palantir Technologies.
The Information Warfare Monitor engages in three primary activities:
1. Case Studies. We design and carry out active case study research. These are self-generated
activities consistent with our mission.
We employ a rigorous and multidisciplinary approach to all our case studies blending qualitative, technical,
and quantitative methods. As a general rule, our investigations consist of at least two components:
Field-based investigations. We engage in qualitative research among affected
target audiences and employ techniques that include interviews, long-term in situ
interaction with our partners, and extensive technical data collection involving
system monitoring, network reconnaissance, and interrogation. Our field-based teams
are supported by senior analysts and regional specialists, including social scientists,
computer security professionals, policy experts, and linguists, who provide additional
contextual support and substantive back-up.
Technical scouting and laboratory analysis. Data collected in the field is rigorously
analysed using a variety of advanced data fusion and visualization methods. Leads
developed on the basis of infield activities are pursued through “technical scouting,”
including computer network investigations, and the resulting data and analysis
is shared with our infield teams and partners for verification and for generating
additional entry points for follow-on investigations.

52

2. Open Source Trend Analysis. We collect open-source information from the press and other
sources tracking global trends in cyberspace. These are published on our public website.
3. Analytical Workshops and Outreach. We work closely with academia, human rights
organizations, and the defense and intelligence community. We publish reports, and occasionally
conduct joint workshops. Our work is independent, and not subject to government classification. Our
goal is to encourage vigorous debate around critical policy issues. This includes engaging in ethical
and legal considerations of information operations, computer network attacks, and computer network
exploitation, including the targeted use of Trojans and malware, denial of service attacks, and
content filtering.
