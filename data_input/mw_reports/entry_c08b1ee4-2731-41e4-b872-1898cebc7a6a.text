Executive Summary
Buer task includes domain profiler that appears to have code reuse with the version of
Buer being leveraged by TrickBots crew
Buers new functionality around loading shellcode[4] as a task allowing for broader
functionality against targets without the need for downloading a separate CobaltStrike
stager
Buers new panel also includes functionality for helping setup distribution for spamming
operations and creation of pre-loader objects

2/9

One of the crews involved in TrickBot has been utilizing Buer[1] loader for sometime now[2,5] to
ultimately deliver CobaltStrike[3] and ultimately leading to ransomware. The version of Buer
being leveraged for these campaigns has more updates being done to it that appear to be
completely designed around an enterprise focus. One such piece that hasn’t been discussed
very publicly is that Buer also has a component that is frequently delivered in memory as a task
and communicates with the same C2 as Buer but over a different port.

DomainInfo
Enter Buers ‘DomainInfo’ component which is ultimately designed to profile some information
about the infected system and the network that it is joined to.
The data gathered is constructed into a JSON blob listing ‘Id’, ‘Domains’, ‘Group’ and ‘Server’.

Below is the table explaining what data is harvested:

3/9

After all the data has been collected it will simply post it off to the C2, in doing so a hardcoded
User-Agent is passed in.

4/9

The User-Agent ends up being pretty weird looking but as it turns out the Buer sample that
delivered this file had the same User-Agent.

Traffic example:
POST: /api/v1/modules/domains/dnsUser-Agent: Rt\x7fnqqf4:35%Fuuqj2nUmtsj<H74675739;;@%Z@%HUZ%qnpj%Rfh%TX%]@%js.%Fuuqj\\jgPny49750%PMYRQ1%qnpj%Ljhpt.%[jwxnts4835%Rtgnqj46F:98%Xfkfwn496>38{ "Id":
"e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855" "Domains": {
"DomainsError": "", "DomainsNetBios": [""], "DomainsDns": [""] }, "Group": {
"JoinStatus": "NetSetupWorkgroupName", "GroupType": "WORKGROUP" }, "Server": {
"PCNames": [""] }}

ShellCode

5/9

Shellcode as a task in Buer has been around but its addition in a bot being leveraged for
primarily distributing CobaltStrike makes complete sense as removing a middle man separate
stager and allowing Buer to directly load stager shellcode or even a reflectively loaded beacon
directly.

6/9

Spammer Workplace
Buer now also includes the ability to help with spamming through the creation of document
based loaders and various delivery chains from the panel:

7/9

Inside the spammer workshop binaries can also be leveraged such as the recently mentioned
Rust based loader version from ProofPoint[6]. Buer loader has been one of the most actively
developed and updated loaders that we have tracked in 2021.
