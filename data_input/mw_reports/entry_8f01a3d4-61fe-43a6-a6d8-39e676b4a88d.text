Findings From Our Ongoing Investigations

SolarWinds was one of a growing number of targets of a highly sophisticated, broad, and
coordinated nation-state cyber operation that compromised multiple software and hardware
companies. Along with our partners in industry and government, we believe other additional
attack vectors unrelated to SolarWinds will continue to come to light over the coming weeks.
This nation-state operation was a broad-based attack on the IT infrastructure on which we all
rely. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), other
companies were compromised before the impacted versions of the Orion Platform were
deployed to customers last year. Given its breadth, CISA’s acting director, Brandon Wales,
told the Wall Street Journal recently that “this campaign should not be thought of as the
SolarWinds campaign.” We’ve committed to sharing what we learn from this experience and
continuing to fortify our systems as we work closely with our customers to protect their
systems. This operation, however, highlights the need for enhanced collaboration within the
industry to collectively improve how we prevent, manage, and remediate these kinds of
threats and operations in the future. It also underscores the need for deeper public and
private partnerships to create a more secure environment for everyone. As SolarWinds
continues collaborating with private experts, law enforcement, and government agencies to
investigate the attacks, we’re exploring several potential theories about how the threat actors
were able to enter and access our environment, and what actions the threat actors took once
inside. Together with our third-party forensic investigators, we’re pursuing numerous theories
but currently believe the most likely attack vectors came through a compromise of
1/4

credentials and/or access through a third-party application via an at the time zero-day
vulnerability. Investigations are still ongoing and given the sophistication of these attacks and
the actions taken by the threat actors to manipulate our environment and remove evidence of
their activities, combined with the large volumes of log and other data to analyze, our
investigations will be ongoing for at least several more weeks, and possibly months. As we
previously shared, FireEye contacted us December 12, 2020 regarding malicious code that
was identified in the SolarWinds Orion Platform. Additionally, Microsoft notified us December
13, 2020 about a compromise related to our Office 365 environment. We’ve analyzed data
from multiple systems and logs, including from our Office 365 and Azure tenants, along with
logs from SolarWinds Security Event Manager, and our build environment platforms. As
previously reported, this analysis has determined threat actors gained unauthorized access
to our environment and conducted reconnaissance prior to the trial conducted on our Orion
Platform software build in October 2019. We have not yet determined the exact date that the
threat actors first gained unauthorized access to our environments. While we’ve confirmed
suspicious activity related to our Office 365 environment, our investigation has not identified
a specific vulnerability in Office 365 that would have allowed the threat actor to enter our
environment through Office 365. We’ve confirmed that a SolarWinds email account was
compromised and used to programmatically access accounts of targeted SolarWinds
personnel in business and technical roles. By compromising credentials of SolarWinds
employees, the threat actors were able to gain access to and exploit our Orion development
environment. Research community investigations have highlighted these nation-state
operators displayed determination, patience, extremely high operational security (OpSec),
and advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). As part of our commitment to
ensuring the industry has a more complete understanding of the increasingly sophisticated
and organized threats, we’re sharing these examples that come from the cybersecurity
research community and our investigations:
Variation and/or disabling of audit logs, timestamps, and other security measures;
Manipulation of software builds through reusable automated processes and
deployment of novel, sophisticated malware to effect exploitation and malicious goals;
Modification through laundering of legitimate code from malicious code injection
(SUNSPOT) and monitoring of disk space and activities before executing or creating
files;
Deletion of files and programs following use to avoid forensic discovery and
masquerading of file names and activity to mimic legitimate applications and files;
Variation of file names and other indicators across victims and within environments and
active reconnaissance of victim environments and users for indicia of detection; and
Automated dormancy periods of two weeks or more prior to activation, utilization of
servers outside the monitoring authority of U.S. intelligence.
We are committed to sharing information openly in order to help the industry guard against
similar attacks in the future and create safer environments for customers. For instance, given
that software development and build processes are generally quite common throughout the
industry, we promptly shared information about the novel malicious code injector
2/4

(SUNSPOT) we found so that other companies could check their software build
environments and make any updates necessary to protect themselves. We published these
details about the build manipulation activity in our January 11 blog post. Our partner
CrowdStrike also published additional details related to this activity in a blog post published
the same day. We continue to put a priority on our investigations to ensure we fully
understand all elements of this sophisticated attack and can share our learnings with our
customers and the broader community. We firmly believe the best way for the industry to
prepare for and prevent attacks of these types in the future is to communicate openly and
work together. *********************************************************************** This Blog Post
