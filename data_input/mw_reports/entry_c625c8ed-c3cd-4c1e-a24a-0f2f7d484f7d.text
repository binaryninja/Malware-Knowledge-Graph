Threat actors carried out an attack on the Solana blockchain network on Aug. 3, 2022, with
$7 million being drained from over 8,000 individual crypto wallets. The apparent culprit in
the attack: a little-known piece of malware called Luca Stealer.
Earlier this summer, threat actors released the source code for the previously unknown
Rust-based malware, since dubbed Luca Stealer, on underground hacking forums. While
the malware has several information-stealing functions, its primary targets appear to be
password management software and cryptocurrency wallets.
Although the malware has thus-far only been seen targeting Windows® devices, because it
is written in the programming language Rust, the source code could be ported easily to
other operating systems, such as MacOS® or Linux® in the future.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
The source code posting, as seen in Figure 1, made the Rust-based malware publicly
available on GitHub, though it has since been removed from the site.

Figure 1 – The malware author’s post on underground forum
Since the code became open source, Luca Stealer has begun showing up in public
malware repositories, often with modifications by the various threat actors that have since
incorporated the malware into their own individual campaigns.
Upon execution, the malware creates a compressed folder called “out.zip,” which is located
within the %Temp% directory. This folder, which contains the files shown in Figure 2 below,
is used to store harvested data for exfiltration.

Screengrab
The attack begins with the stealer taking a screenshot of the victim’s screen at the time of
infection, using the functionality shown in the code snippet in Figure 3. The captured image
is stored under the file name “screen-1.png.”

Discord
After taking the screengrab, the malware then attempts to steal Discord tokens from the
target machine. A Discord token is an encryption of the victim’s Discord username. This
token is created when the user logs in to Discord; it is essentially an authorization code
used to verify authentication. Luca Stealer searches through known Discord directories on
the target machine (as shown in Figure 4) and stores any tokens it finds into the
“discord_tokens.txt” file.

Fingerprinting
Luca Stealer also creates a digital fingerprint of the victim’s system, gathering information
about the target machine and storing it in two text files, called “info.txt” and
“system_info.txt.” These files are placed into the “out.zip” folder mentioned above. The
“system_info.txt” file is used for storing the following information:
Local network information
Percentage of CPU usage
A list of all current running processes
Installed antivirus (AV) information
The “info.txt” file is used to store information that is more personal to the user, such as the
following:
The victim’s username
The language of the victim’s machine
The device’s name
The city/time zone of the victim’s device

Browsers
Luca Stealer next scans the infected device to collect sensitive information related to
popular Chromium-based web browsers.
The malware targets the following browsers:
Microsoft Edge

Chromium

7Star

Amigo

Brave-Browser

CentBrowser

Chedot

Google Chrome

CocCoc

Comodo

Elements

Epic-Privacy

Chrome Canary

Kometa

Orbitum

Sputnik

Torch

uCozMedia

Vivaldi

Atom

Opera

Opera GX

ChromePlus

Iriduium

Sleipnir

Citrio

Coowoo

Liebao

Qip Surf

360 Browser

Personal information that the malware gathers includes login data, cookies, browser
extensions, auto-fill information, payment card details, and more. All of this harvested data
is saved to a text file for exfiltration.

Cryptocurrency
One of the primary functionalities of Luca Stealer is cryptocurrency stealing, where it targets
a pre-set list of crypto wallets. Cryptocurrency can be stored using either “cold storage” or
“hot storage.” Hot storage involves the digital currency being stored in an application or
online platform. Cold storage involves the currency being stored offline, often on a physical
device such as a USB thumb drive or an external hard drive. Unfortunately for the victims
involved in these attacks, Luca targets both hot and cold methods of storage.
When targeting cold-stored crypto wallets, Luca Stealer scours the target machine in search
of any data associated with the crypto wallet extensions shown in the table and Figure 5
below.

Exodus

Jaxx

Electrum

Bytecoin

Ethereum

Guarda

Coinomi

Armory

Zcash

When targeting hot-stored crypto information, the malware targets browser extensions for
the following crypto wallets:
MetaMask

TronLink

BinanceChain

Coin98

iWallet

Wombat

MEW CX

NeoLine

Terra Station

Keplr

Sollet

ICONex

KHC

TezBox

Byone

OneKey

DAppPlay

BitClip

Steem Keychain

In the Solana blockchain attack, users reported funds being drained from their personal hot
wallets, including Phantom, Slope, and TrustWallet. The result of the attack was a loss of
over $7 million in customers’ cryptocurrency. As Luca Stealer has recently become open
source, and with its effectiveness in pilfering from hot-storage wallets, researchers are
identifying it as the malware most likely to have been used to carry out this attack.

Password Manager Browser Add-Ons
One feature that sets Luca apart from typical infostealers is its focus on targeting browser
add-ons used for password management. The malware targets the locally stored data of the
following 17 password manager browser extensions.
Bitwarden

EOS Auth

KeePassXC

Dashlane

1Password

NordPass

Keeper

RoboForm

LastPass

BrowserPass

MYKI

Splikity

CommonKey

Zoho Vault

Norton

Avira

Trezor

The stealer searches the target machine’s %AppData% directory, using the unique IDs of
each of the preset browser extensions listed above, as seen in Figure 6. It does so in hopes
of stealing sensitive information such as login credentials and cookies.

Additional Functionality
In addition to harvesting the data mentioned above, the stealer also targets a range of
additional applications, including the following (also shown in Figure 7):
Steam

Telegram
Element
ICQ
Ubisoft Play
Skype

Exfiltration
Once harvested information is stored in the “out.zip” file, the archive file is sent back to the
threat actor via Discord web hooks or a Telegram bot. Because Telegram bots have a
maximum file upload size of 50MB, transfers larger than this use Discord web hooks.
Along with the stolen data, the stealer will send back a chat message which outlines a
summary of all the information that has been stolen. The format of this can be seen in
Figure 8 below.

Conclusion
Luca Stealer contains much of the functionality expected from a typical infostealer, with an
added focus on crypto wallets and password management software. This malware is likely
to continue to see a steady rise in unique samples available in malware repositories online,
as more and more threat actors get their hands on the open-source code.

Who is Affected?
As the malware is freely available and written in the Rust programming language, all
personal and corporate users are potential targets. The malware is likely to further evolve
over time to use different distribution methods, and to target different operating systems.
9/12

This means no one is safe from this threat, and everyone should continue to be vigilant.

Mitigation Tips
Steps to mitigate the effects of a Luca Stealer attack include:
Avoid downloading “cracked” or pirated software, or software from unknown/unverified
links, and create rules that prevent employees from doing this.
Make sure corporate login credentials and personal passwords are not saved in your
browser.
For those who store cryptocurrencies on their local devices (cold storage), ensure you
have sufficient security measures in place to prevent any unauthorized people from
gaining access to your devices.
Employ user data transfer analysis to analyze the amount of data transferred by a
user (MITRE D3FEND™ technique D3-UDTA).
Implement multi-factor authentication (MITRE D3FEND technique D3-MFA).
Use outbound traffic filtering to restrict network traffic originating from a private host or
enclave destined towards untrusted networks. (MITRE D3FEND technique D3-OTF).
As the malware exfiltrates stolen data through Telegram and Discord, restricting
outbound traffic to these hosts can prevent data from being stolen.
