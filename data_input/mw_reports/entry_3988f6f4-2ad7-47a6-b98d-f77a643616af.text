New RATs Emerge from Leaked Njw0rm Source Code

January 23, 2015

In the middle of my research on the remote access Trojan (RAT) known as “njrat” or
“Njw0rm”, I stumbled upon dev-point.com, a site that disguises itself as a site for “IT
enthusiasts” but actually hosts various downloaders, different types of spyware, and RATs. I
explored the site and found that they host malware under the “Protection Devices” section in
their website. Under this section was a forum written in Arabic, which may suggest that an
Arabic-speaking country is behind it.

Malware from Njw0rm Source Code One of the notable topics in the forum talked about
new malware “kjw0rm” (or HKTL_KJWORM) and a worm named “Sir DoOom,”
(or HKTL_DOOMWORM) which both came about after the release of the Njw0rm malware
source code in the same forum. The leaking of Njw0rm’s source code last May 2013 in
known hacking websites like hackforums.net and dev-point.com led me to the conclusion
that cybercriminals found a way to leverage the worm and backdoor capabilities in Njw0rm to
create new malware with added functionalities. We discovered two versions of Kjw0rm (V2.0
and 0.5X) being shared in dev-point.com in January 2014 and December 2014 respectively.
The Sir DoOoM worm was also discovered in the same site last December 2014. The new
malware are coded in Visual Basic Script, unlike its earlier version, Njw0rm, which was
compiled with AutoIt. Checking the Malware Builder Similar to Njw0rm, the new malware
we found asks the attacker to assign a port to open for incoming traffic, with the default
values being Port 1991, Port 1010 for kjw0rm, and Port 4000 for the Sir DoOom w0rm. The
Sir DoOom worm requires the builder to ‘Run as Administrator’ for it to work.

Looking at Control Panels The new malware added a lot more information in the Control
Panel view of the malware builder, compared to that of the Njw0rm version in May 2013.

We’re also seeing new functions for both Kjw0rm versions and the Sir DoOom worm.

Propagation Routines The new malware based their propagation routines on njw0rm.
Njw0rm propagates via removable devices by getting a list of ten folders in the root directory,
setting them to ‘Hidden’ and making shortcut links using the folder names pointing to the
malware executable. Over a period a time, the malware tweak their propagation methods to
make the attack successful and employ social engineering tactics such as creating legitimate
looking folder to deceive the user.
Kjw0rm V2.0 This worm propagates in removable devices. The worm first drops a
copy of itself (Hidden, System File Attribute) in the root directory of the removable
drive. It hides all folders, and creates shortcut files with folder icons with the same
folder names – all pointing to the malware executable. Kjw0rm V0.5X This malware
has the same routines as Kjw0rm V2.0. However, it gets a list of 20 folders on the
removable drive, hides the 20 folders, and creates shortcut files with folder icons with
the same folder names—all pointing to the malware executable. The malware then
creates a folder named Videos. After creating the folder, the malware redoes the
propagation routine to get a list of 20 folders, but now includes the subfolders. Sir
DoOom worm The Sir DoOom worm has the same propagation method as Kjw0rm
V0.5x. The only difference is that the malware creates five folders namely: Videos,
Pictures, Movies, Games, and DCIM in the removable drive’s root directory.

Kjw0rm V2.0 The propagation method of this malware targets all folders in the root
directory of the removable drive. Kjw0rm V0.5X This worm obfuscated some portions
of the malware code. The malware author utilizes an obfuscator tool that converts
characters to hex values, adds filler functions, and performs computations that make
analysis more difficult and time-consuming.

This malware also has an anti-VM (virtual machine) routine. It first searches for a list of
the installed programs in the affected computer. If this variant found itself to be in a
computer where a VM program is installed, it will uninstall and terminate itself from the
affected system. This prevents analyst to do testing to determine malware behavior.
Sir DoOom worm This malware incorporates new functionalities that are unique to this
malware.
Parsing of OS product key
Termination of antivirus-related processes (terminates Tiger-Firewall.exe
and bavtray.exe)
Anti-VM routines (looks for the string ‘Virtual’ in the list of installed programs; if
found, it uninstalls and terminates itself)
Bitcoin mining
Launching of DDOS attacks
Kjw0rm evolution from njRAT The first version of Kjw0rm was released on January 2014
(V2.0X) followed by the second version (v0.5x) by the end of the year. The Sir DoOom worm
was released in December 21, 2014. This evolution shows that the malware authors are
becoming more active in developing new malware and using njw0rm as a template. Because
of this pattern, we can expect to see more variants of this malware in the future.

Solutions and best practices To stay protected against these new threats, we advise users
to refrain from plugging removable drives that came from unknown computers or computers
that aren’t protected by security solutions. Avoid opening and installing programs from
unknown web sources. Paying attention to small details also helps. For example, finding
shortcut files in "folder" icons with your folder names is a strong indicator that the removable
drive is infected. Stay vigilant by keeping abreast of the latest cybercriminals tricks and
techniques. Finally, make sure your security software is always updated in order to detect
and remove similar threats. Related hashes:
