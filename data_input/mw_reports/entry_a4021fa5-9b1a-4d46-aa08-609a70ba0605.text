Hackers working on behalf of Russian intelligence services breached the internal network of
Dutch police in 2017 during the country‚Äôs investigation of the MH-17 crash.
The intrusion was kept under wraps by Dutch investigators until this week when multiple
sources revealed the incident to Dutch newspaper the Volkskrant.

Breach occurred via Police academy server
According to the newspaper‚Äôs reporting, the attack was traced back to September 2017,
when Russian hackers used a vulnerability in an ‚Äúexotic software‚Äù to breach a server
belonging to the Dutch Police Academy, from where they pivoted to the main Dutch police
network.
The intrusion was uncovered by AIVD, the Dutch intelligence service, after it saw a Dutch
police IP address communicating with known malicious servers operated by Russian statesponsored threat actors.
The AIVD, which previously breached a Russian intelligence service itself in 2014, alerted
Dutch police.

Volkskrant said that due to a lack of monitoring/logging, the AIVD and Dutch Police have
very little knowledge of what the hackers did inside the police network.
Sources also described several moments of friction between the two Dutch agencies when it
came to deciding on how to handle the intrusion and subsequent clean-up, with the AIVD
wanting to keep the hackers under surveillance while police officials wanted them removed
from their systems due to the possibility of compromising sensitive cases.

Intrusion linked to Russian intelligence
Volkskrant said that sources linked the 2017 Dutch police hack to APT29 (Cozy Bear), a
well-known hacking group that the White House linked earlier this year to the Russian
Foreign Intelligence Service, also known as the SVR.
However, in a subsequent article update, Volkskrant said that attribution of the hack is far
from accurate, as some sources also linked the attack to APT28 (Fancy Bear), a hacking
group that was previously linked to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence service.
Neither Dutch police nor the AIVD confirmed or commented on the newspaper‚Äôs reporting.
Either way, investigators were positive the attack was carried out by Russian intelligence as
Dutch authorities were investigating the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), which
they concluded was downed by a missile shot by rogue Russian-backed rebel forces active
in eastern Ukraine.
During the investigation into the flight‚Äôs crash, which was led by Dutch authorities, several
Dutch organizations were targeted by both APT28 and APT29 on multiple occasions.
As part of the Russian government‚Äôs desperate attempts at gaining insights into the
investigation, Russian intelligence agents also traveled to the Netherlands to hack a police
station and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a notorious
incident for which the EU imposed sanctions against the Russian intelligence agents in 2020.
Tensions between Russia and the Netherlands remain high due to the MH-17 investigation.
A recent AIVD report claimed that Russia still ran influence operations in 2020, trying to
discredit the findings of its MH-17 investigation.
Earlier this year, the Netherlands also said it discovered and kicked out two SVR
agents working at the Russian embassy in The Hague under diplomatic accreditation.
Dutch officials, led by the AIVD, are also currently looking into making espionage a crime.

Fun fact: espionage, while a crime in many places, is not in any extradition treaties.

This causes some weird pretenses when country A might very much want to extradite
a person from country B
