APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS

PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS

• Does APT always means Advanced?
• Case scenario: A target using unpatched Windows XP with no AV.
– A very advanced toolset would be an overkill and comes with an unnecessary toolset
exposure, whilst a simple toolset will get the job done most of the times.

– Modern APT’s, Re-use of available tools, think copy-cat, evading attribution.
– Simplicity always wins over complexity. Especially when time frames are shorts
and/or budgets are limited.

PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS

• Public and most known “Middle-East” APT’s, based on public feeds:
• GREENBUG
• OILRIG
• MUDDYWATER
• APT 33
• APT 34
•

•

…..

Up-to-date Middle-East APT OSINT data can be found here:
•

https://darkmatter.ae/evolution-muddywater-advanced-persistent-threat-apt/

PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS
•

Most of them rely on open-source tools:

• Empire, Metasploit, Mimikatz, invoke-obfuscation, PsExec…
• Minor some customization: strings replacements, code refractoring, ..

•

Sometimes relying and re-using low commodity malware:

• RATs: NANOCORE, NETWIRE, njRAT, ...
• OR build copy-pasta Android malware, ..

•

Usually copy-cat actors, unless some of them developed custom basic hack tools:

•

•

POWERSTATS, ISMAGENT, MICROSPIA, ...

Then they unlock the glorifying life-time “APT” attribution.

PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS
•

Example of OilRig custom x64 Mimikatz:

• Original Mimikatz x64 version have 1779 functions in total
• OilRig modified Mimikatz have only 660 functions in total
• Based on mimikatz version 0.1
• Have all the strings changed

WHY AND HOW WINDSHIFT APT IS DIFFERENT?

PART II: WHY AND HOW WINDSHIFT IS DIFFERENT?
•

It’s a long term non-attributable APT.

•

Pure Intelligence and Cyber espionage actor -> mostly active surveillance

•

It’s been there for a while, and never got popped.

•

Versatile, sophisticated and unpredictable Spear phishing attacks

•

They Re-use your favorite APT malware (and Infrastructures):

•

•

•

aka Hacking other APT actors

Very rarely directly engage targets with malware :

•

2 attempts in 2017, very specific individuals.

•

3 attempts in 2018, again very specific individuals.

They are ONLY after specific individuals. Rarely targets corporate environments. This what helped
them staying under the radar for years.

WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 1: RECON – phase 1 duration 1-2 years
• Via maintained fake personas on different social platforms:
– Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Plus.

• Sending Friend Requests, engaging a conversation, to get

identifiable information, emails, phone numbers, friends contacts

• Through social media mobile apps:
– Example of such apps, phonebooks, stealing contact list,

emails and SMS contents https://darkmatter.ae/darkmatteridentifies-app-stealing-personal-information/

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 1: RECON – phase 1 duration 1-2 years
• Example of fake online persona Asalah (‫ )أﺻﺎﻟﺔ آل ﺳﻣﯾﺣﺔ‬Al Sameeha
linked to WINDSHIFT APT:

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Twitter OSINT 101:
• Legitimate Twitter account vs APT maintained Twitter Account
(Weekly Activity) – using tweets_analyzer.py tool -

APT maintained Twitter account: @aheemaslahalasa

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 2: RECON – phase 2 – duration 6 months – 1 year
• Long term monitoring of targets via benign emails:
– Click habits, subjects of interests
– Geo locating targets + Type of computer target uses (via User-Agent)
– Email click rate
– Usage of mailing lists, sending daily emails: duplicating content of local media

• Building a sort of content habit and relationship with the target over time.
=> increasing click rates, preparing the targets for the next phases.

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 2: RECON – phase 2 – duration 6 months – 1 year
– Benign email, example of Khaleej times content duplication, link pointing to legit
Khaleej times as well:

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 2: RECON – phase 2 – duration 6 months – 1 year
– From the email source we found
Tracking via Wasmyemailread[.]com:

Also tracking via ifread[.]com

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)
•

Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day

•

Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery or password reset of following providers :

–

Targeting personal emails : Gmail , Apple iCloud, Etisalat (main ISP in UAE)

–

Targeting professional emails: OWA outlook

•

Send SMS redirecting to a credential harvesting page.

•

Domain typo squatting

•

Domains resolves only 1 day during the attack then shutdown.

•

Anonymous domains registered with freenom.com for free: .ml, .tk, .ga. gq

•

Also domains registered with Internet BS, Namecheap, with Whois Privacy Guard..

•

Credential harvesting landing pages are using HTTPS : free SSL certificates with let’s encrypt, or
COMODO Free SSL ..

•

Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day

•

Gmail harvesting attempt:

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 4: Hacking targets, 1 or twice per year
• This phase usually happens if Phase 3 was unsuccessful after many attempts. It
is the last resort phase.

• Infection vector: Emails (related to previous interaction emails of phase 2)
having link to a drive by download delivering malware. Or emails having a
direct malware attachment, usually within an archive.

• Weaponize and re-use malware from different threat actors.
• Re-use command and control infrastructure from other groups
• Real separation between spear phishing infrastructure and malware C2
infrastructure, to avoid attribution, suspicions and takedowns..

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)
•

Below is the separation of WINDSHIFT APT C&C and spear phishing
infrastructures:

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)
•

Phase 5 : Disappear

• Shutting the domain names and all related information for months
• Switching to other spear phishing infrastructures
• Continuously getting more access to new infrastructures:
– Hacking
– Renting infrastructures
– purchasing new access from VPS resellers (bitcoin), bullet proof hosting providers.

• Repointing domains to new infrastructures
• Getting access to more malware, and more C2 infrastructures and maintain the access
until flagged

PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)

• Phase 5 : Disappear
•

Example of OWA spear phishing domain :

on January 2018, webmail-badirah-ae.html-5.me moving from WILDCARD-UK Unlimited to Bodis LLC :

Bodis LLC is known to be linked to Dark Hotel and to many others:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A

• WINDTAIL.A : Signed macOS backdoor exfiltrating files having the
following extensions: .txt .pdf .doc .docx .ppt .pptx .db .rtf .xls
.xlsx

• Persists via LoginItems
• Strings encrypted with AES-256-ECB and encoded with Base64.
AES key hardcoded in the sample:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A

• First apparition in January 2017
• Infection vector via spear phishing emails, pointing to a specially
crafted webpage. The targeted emails were pointing victims to
access a VIP contacts list:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A
•

The specially crafted webpage will download a file VVIP_Contacts.zip, and will
call a URL scheme: openurl2622015://a:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A
•

The custom URL scheme of VVIP_Contacts.app contained a typo “missing the
letter L”

•

Which results in the failure of this first targeted attack.

•

Nevertheless, attackers gave a backdoor a realistic look by mimicking an Excel
sheet icon, and most of the unaware victims will fall in this second trap by double
clicking on the app to access the VIP contact list

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A
•

Demo #1 :

• How a custom URL scheme is added to the LaunchServices database (via a file
download, network shares, etc..)

• How to trigger the custom URL scheme using a specifically crafted webpage
• Weakness of the attacker controlled user consent pop-up
• Lateral movement: how WINDTAIL.A infect any MacOS via network shares
• 1-click Malware infection and persistence

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.A
•

Rewrite ? of “Hack Back” aka “KitM OSX” , 2012 surveillance malware. We find the exact
same helper function re-used (reading last 8-bytes of a specified file)

•

Signed with new Developer ID certificate

•

Weaponized with AES-256-ECB

•

Sign of code re-use ->

•

Same C&C servers IP from 2012

•

“Hack Back” aka “KitM OSX” is linked to:

• Operation Hangover / Appin Security
• Indian APT group from 2012

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.B
•

WINDTAIL.B, first apparition in January 2018

•

Infection vector is with direct email attachments

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.B
•

Weaponized with AES-256-ECB

•

Full rewrite of WINDTAIL.A (appeared exactly one year later after WINDTAIL.A)

•

Additionally downloads and execute WINDTAPE (see next slides)

•

Weird similarities with Komplex OSX Trojan from Sofacy APT (aka APT 28):

• Testing if www.google.com is available using the Reachability framework
•

Komplex OSX communicated with C2 hosted via AltusHost B.V a Netherlands service
provider. AltusHost B.V is linked to several group and majorly used by Russian and Indian
APT groups:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAIL.B
•

Also AltusHost B.V had 46 IP’s related to Operation Hangover: Attribution to India

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAPE
•

WINDTAPE, first apparition in January 2018

•

WINDTAPE, is the a second stage downloaded by WINDTAIL.B

•

The below PCAP was recorded from our macOS Honeypot:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAPE
•

Main purpose :

•

Taking a Screenshot of the current Desktop

•

Sending the Screenshot to the C2

•

Removing the Screenshot

•

Repeat every 5 seconds

•

Using KSReachability framework to determine if the infected hosts is connected to the internet, KSReachability
code is originally cloned from this GIT repo: https://github.com/kstenerud/KSReachability. (We found the
exact same Credits.rtf left inside WINDTAIL.A)

•

Function names in Farisi :

•

Goli means Flower/Rose

•

Namac means Salt

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAPE
•

String encryption:

•

The encryption used is DES with a hardcoded Key and IV.

•

CCCrypt is used, so I wrote the decryption routine in objective-C as following:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAPE
•

Demo #2 :

• WIDTAPE taking screenshots + Exfiltrating the captured images to
the C&C

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDTAPE
•

Final Remarks on the encryption keys used in WINDTAIL.A/B and WINDTAPE

•

The encryption keys are hardcoded in the sample in the UTF-16LE format:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDDROP
•

WINDDROP, a Windows dropper, first appeared in May 2018, found by pivoting over the
C2 through an online malware repository. This sample shares the same C&C server with
the other macOS backdoors. It starts by sending information about the infected hosts :

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDROP
•

Downloads a second stage backdoor drop.txt

•

Pass the execution to the a second still unidentified backdoor. No details about this second
stage backdoor found yet, the file was removed from the server.

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDROP
•

Stack strings are encrypted, tools like FLOSS wont be able decode them:

VS
•

Configuration strings are encoded:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDROP
•

All the decryption is performed via a standalone decryption function:

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDROP
•

Can it be decrypted using emulation ? Yes.

•

emulation using Radare2 is possible, see:

•http://www.mien.in/2018/08/14/emulating-decryption-function-with-radare2/

•

Can we do it with Binary Ninja?

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDROP
•

Demo#3: Decrypt WINDROP encrypted strings using:

• The Unicorn engine
• Binary Ninja
• Ripr plugin
• And some ninja skills...

PART IV: WINDSHIFT TOOL-SET - WINDROP
•

WINDROP strings can be decrypted via x86 emulation :

ATTRIBUTION, WHO’S BEHIND WINDSHIFT APT?

PART V: ATTRIBUTION, WHO’S BEHIND WINDSHIFT APT?
• An advanced APT hacked into Appin servers, or purchased their source code:
•

An APT hacked into Operation Hangover and got access to “KitM” and “Hack
Back” malware source code :

• Since not activity was recorded between 2012 and 2017 moreover Appin was
shutdown during that time.

• Suddenly variants of malware appeared in 2017 all signed with developer id’s
having emails very similar BAHAMUT APT MO’s: example
warren82port@mail.com was used to sign WINDTAIL malware.

• BAHAMUT APT, is an obscure group tracked by Bellingcat showing a very

similar email address composition : usually English first name, last name, and
a number @ mail (.com, .ru) as well as VERY similar MO’s:

VI
CONCLUSIONS

PART VI: CONCLUSIONS
•

Appin Security was highly likely either targeted by an advanced APT group or tools stolen by
rogue employee or tools (malware, servers access..) were sold to a third party.

•

Fact 1: Appin Security previously reported tools and infrastructures are today re-used to covertly
hack into governments.

•

Fact 2: We found overlaps with known existing APT actors:

– MO’s (including: Domain registration, phishing emails and SMS’s) : BAHAMUT APT,
Fancy Bear

– Infrastructure used: BAHAMUT APT, Fancy Bear
– Malware coding practices similarities: SOFACY
– VPS providers: SOFACY, Fancy Bear, CARBANAK, DARK HOTEL, MORPHO, BAHAMUT
– Passive DNS data: overlap with BAHAMUT, SOFACY
•

Fact 3: WINDSHIFT APT are currently targeting government using Appin Security tools.
