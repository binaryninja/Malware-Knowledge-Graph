How to use the Emsisoft Decrypter
for Philadelphia
IMPORTANT! Make sure you remove the malware from your system first. Otherwise, it will
repeatedly lock your system or encrypt files. Any reliable antivirus solution can do this for you. If
your system was compromised through the Windows Remote Desktop feature, we also
recommend changing all passwords of all users that are allowed to login remotely and check the
local user accounts for additional accounts the attacker might have added.
The decrypter requires access to a file pair consisting of one encrypted file and the original, unencrypted
version of the encrypted file to reconstruct the encryption keys needed to decrypt the rest of your data.
Please do not change the file names of original and encrypted file, as the decrypter may perform file
name comparisons to determine the correct file extension used for encrypted files on your system.

How to decrypt your files
1.

Download the decrypter from the same site that provided this “How To” document.

2.

Once downloaded, select your file pair, and drag and drop it with your mouse onto the
decrypter executable:

3.

Once the mouse key is released, the decrypter will start to reconstruct the required encryption
parameters. Depending on the ransomware, this process can take a significant amount of time:

The decrypter will display the reconstructed encryption details once the recovery process
finished. The display is purely informational to confirm that the required encryption details have
been found:

5.

The license terms will show up next, which you have to agree to by clicking the “Yes” button:

By default, the decrypter will pre-populate the locations to decrypt with the currently connected
drives and network drives. Additional locations can be added using the “Add” button. Also, the
object list accepts files and locations to be added via drag and drop.

Decrypters typically offer various options depending on the particular malware family. The
available options are located in the Options tab and can be enabled or disabled there. You can
find a detailed list of the available Options below.

If you require the report for your personal records, you can save it by clicking the “Save log”
button. You can also copy it straight to your clipboard to paste it into emails or forum posts if
you are asked to.

Available decrypter options
The decrypter currently implements the following options:


Keep encrypted files
Since the ransomware does not save any information about the unencrypted files, the decrypter
can’t guarantee that the decrypted data is identical to the one that was previously encrypted.
Therefore, the decrypter by default will opt on the side of caution and not remove any
encrypted files after they have been decrypted. If you want the decrypter to remove any
encrypted files after they have been processed, you can disable this option. Doing so may be
necessary if your disk space is limited.
