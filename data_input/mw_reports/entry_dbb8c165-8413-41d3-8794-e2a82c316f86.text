Experts at Kaspersky have been investigating various computer incidents on a daily basis for
over a decade. Having been in the field for so long, we have witnessed some major changes
in the cybercrime world’s modus operandi. This report shares our insights into the Russianspeaking cybercrime world and the changes in how it operates that have happened in the
past five years.
We overview what kind of attacks are now carried out by cybercriminals and what influenced
this change — including such factors as changes in vulnerability market and browser safety.
We also review what pushed cybercriminals to transform their operations into the now wellknown malware-as-a-service model — the use of cloud servers, the decreasing relevance of
custom malware and the subsequent emergence of small, agile teams. Lastly, we analyze
the targets that cybercriminals select these days as opposed to a few years back, the
reasoning behind them and criminal-to-criminal services offered on the dark web.

While this report is primarily focused on cybercriminals that operate on Russian territory,
cybercriminals rarely restrict themselves to national borders — with ransomware gangs
being a prime example of such cross-border activity. Moreover, trends that are visible in one
country, more often than not resurface in other places and among new cybercriminal gangs.
This report attempts to shed light on the changes in cybercriminals’ operations that we deem
important — and actionable.

Incident analysis
Kaspersky’s Computer Incident Investigations Department specializes in attacks by
Russian-speaking and Russia-based cybercriminals. The services we offer include incident
analysis, investigation and post-incident expert support, all directed at preventing and
mitigating the consequences of cyberattacks.
Back in 2016, the primary focus of our expert was on major cybergangs that targeted
financial institutions, banks in particular. Big names such as Lurk, Buhtrap, Metel, RTM,
Fibbit and Carbanak boldly terrorized banks nationwide, yet eventually fell apart or ended up
behind bars — with our help too. Others cybercriminal groups, such as Cerberus, left the
game and shared their source code with the world.
These days, the industries under attack are not limited to financial institutions, while major
attacks like those we investigated back in the day thankfully are no longer possible. On top of
that, due to changes in legislation that limited financial institutions in hiring external services,
the number of cases we investigated for financial industry clients in 2020 was zero.
We investigated 200 cases for clients in Russia in 2020, and already over 300 in the first
nine months of 2021. The industries affected included everything from IT to retail, from oil
and gas to healthcare. This is a surprising trend, as one would expect COVID-19 and the
move to remote working to have prompted more computer incidents. But our visibility
showed otherwise.

Key trends
The cybercriminal ecosystem has always consisted of various roles. The main constants in
this system are the infrastructure needed for carrying out cybercriminal activity and the
instruments used for this activity. The roles of people in the game directly depend on the
infrastructure and the instruments — and these have changed. Let’s delve into some of the
major shifts that have taken place in the cybersecurity sphere in the past five years and see
how they have transformed the way Russian-speaking cybercriminals operate.

Client-side attacks on the wane

2/13

It may be hard to imagine these days, but just five years ago to get your computer infected
with a Trojan was as easy as visiting a news website. In fact, a lot of malware in Russia was
distributed “straight from the front page” — via news platforms and other legitimate websites.
True, web attacks are not a thing of the past yet, but with increasing browser security, attacks
via this vector have become much harder. Previously, many cybercriminals lived simply by
distributing exploits via legitimate websites. A whole market was built around that process —
with dedicated staff to make it roll.
At the time, browsers were full of vulnerabilities, offered bad user experience and were
generally insecure. Many used browsers that they were accustomed to, not browsers of
choice, or default browsers set by organizations, such as the Internet Explorer. Attacks via
plugins, such as Adobe Flash, Silverlight and Java, were also among the easiest and most
often used ways to infect user devices — and now they are a thing of the past.
In 2021, browsers are much safer, with some of them updating automatically, without any
user participation, while browser developers continually invest in vulnerabilities assessment.
Furthermore, with the development of numerous bug-bounty programs, it has become easier
to sell discovered vulnerabilities to developers themselves, rather than look for a buyer on
the dark web. That also led to higher prices for vulnerabilities.
With safer browsers, web infections have become more challenging and, ultimately,
unattractive to cybercriminals. As a result, targeting regular rather than corporate users with
such means has become too expensive and not commercially viable.

Vulnerabilities market got a remake
Applications have become more complex, their architecture better. This has radically
changed the way Russian-speaking cybercriminals operate.
With vulnerabilities rising in price, client-side operations have become extremely difficult and
expensive. Client-side infections used to rely heavily on vulnerabilities; entire teams would
look for them and write exploits for particular vulnerabilities — adjusted for different operating
systems. Most often, cybercriminals exploited 1-day vulnerabilities — they examined
developers’ patches recently rolled out and wrote exploits for vulnerabilities that were closed.
However, since the software update period was (and still is) quite long, users often updated
their devices with a delay, therefore leaving a window during which cybercriminals could
infect quite a few victims.
A typical infection chain looked like this: a legitimate website was compromised — just five
years ago securing websites wasn’t really the done thing. It could be compromised directly or
by hacking the account of someone with access to the website management. The attacker
would integrate some piece of code — it could be a window on the page, invisible to the
user. Then, since the target would continue to use the website, it would also load the page
controlled by the attackers. Another option was to compromise a banner network — with

3/13

banners being available across myriad sites and the website management not having a vote
on what ad was displayed. It was also possible to simply buy and direct traffic to a specific
malicious page. Ultimately, the goal was to covertly lead the user to a page controlled by the
attackers, with this page containing code that would exploit one of the vulnerabilities in the
user’s browser.

4/13

This browser attack chain, popular in 2016, is no longer possible

5/13

To ensure more users were infected, cybercriminal groups developed exploit kits for specific
user groups and tailored exploits downloaded to victims’ devices. After running the exploit,
the attackers would choose a specific payload to be downloaded to the infected device. The
payload usually resulted in remote access to the computer. Once infected, the device would
be assessed based on how attractive it was to the cybercriminals. After that, the attackers
would load a specific exploit that would assess the interest of the infected device, and then a
specific malware was uploaded to it (if the victim was interesting at all).
With such browser attacks being no longer viable, nor easy to execute, a whole array of
different players were no longer in demand. This included groups that specialized in
purchasing and directing traffic to specific pages with exploits, groups that developed and
sold exploit packs, groups that purchased access to specific devices (the latter still exist,
albeit they sell it to different players now).
Of course, vulnerabilities in client-side software remained — just now they are not in
browsers, but in various types of documents such as PDF or Word with Macros options
typically distributed via email. Still, this change makes attacks and the infection process
much harder. Unlike with browser infections, when distributing a malicious file hidden in a
PDF or Word, the attacker is not able to receive feedback from the victim or additional
information about the device the target uses. Browsers, on the other hand, reported what
versions of software and plugins they have automatically. This way, with attackers switching
to distributing malicious files via phishing emails, it has become more difficult to track the
version of the user’s software, or how far the attack went. On top of that, safety mechanisms
in email servers and in applications such as Word also made it harder to carry out an
infection — many emails containing malicious files are not intercepted before they get to the
target, while users receive regular warnings inside applications about potentially dangerous
attachments.

Cloud servers for all
Infrastructure is needed for communication and data storage.
As organizations progress in the adoption of new IT-services, so do cybercriminals who
follow the same trends and changes. Moving to cloud services instead of regular servers has
freed their hands. Before, cybercriminals would rent the servers — quite legitimately, albeit
often not under their own names. In 2016, complaints against servers that were connected to
suspicious activities were easier to ignore — at the time, some organizations offered bulletproof servers that would ignore user complaints. However, as time went by, managing such
servers has become harder and less profitable — a result of greater interest in cybercrime
on the part of local authorities.

6/13

Cybercriminals also used to hack into servers of organizations to use them as relay servers
to throw investigators off the scent and make it harder to trace the main C&C center.
Sometimes cybergangs would store some information — for instance, data extracted from
victims— on servers they had compromised. This sort of structure with data being spread
over various platforms required dedicated staff to manage it.
The adoption of cloud servers made life easier for cybercriminals — now, if multiple
complaints resulted in the suspension of an account, moving the data to a new server was a
two-minute job. It also meant that the teams no longer needed a dedicated admin to manage
the server — this task was outsourced to the cloud server provider.

Malware developers — no longer hiring
Perhaps the scariest trend of all is how easy it has become for cybercriminals to gain access
to new effective malware. While APT actors continue to invest large funds and resources into
tailor-made malicious tools, cybercriminals choose the easier, less costly way, which no
longer includes developing their own malware or exploits.
Open-source malware is appearing on the dark web more and more often — it has become a
trend for established cybergangs to release their source code to the public for free, making it
fairly easy for new players to start their cybercriminal activity. The developers of Cerberus, a
banking Trojan, released the source code of their malware in October 2020, while Babuk, the
developer of the infamous ransomware of the same name, had their ransomware code
released early in September 2021.
To make matters worse, with the development of penetration-testing tools and services, the
dark market saw the rise of new malicious tools. These tools are developed and used for
legitimate services, such as assessing clients’ security infrastructure and potential for
successful network penetration. They are meant to be sold to a carefully selected client base
that would only use them for legitimate purposes. Yet, inevitably, these tools eventually end
up in the hands of cybercriminals. One of the most notable examples is cybercriminals’
favorite CobaltStrike, a decompiled version of which was leaked in November 2020 — and is
now seen in active use by both cybercriminals and APT groups. Others include Bloodhound,
another favorite cybercriminal tool for network mapping, Kali and Commando VM for
specialized distribution, Core Impact and Metaspoit Framework for exploiting vulnerabilities,
use of netscan.exe (softPerfect Network Scanner) on compromised computers, and
legitimate services for remote access, such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk and RMS/LMS. To top
it off, cybercriminals make use of legitimate services that are meant to help system
administrators, such as PSexec, which allows remote execution of programs.
Understandably, such tools have risen in popularity since the pandemic and the consequent
rise in remote working.
These days, to understand what kind of tools cybercriminals use, it is enough to see what
pen-testers deploy and offer on the market.

Essentially, the malware development market has reached its maturity stage. Given the
abundance of information, starting a cybercriminal operation is easier than ever before. At
the same time, it has become more difficult to attack companies. Protection systems do not
stand still; awareness is growing. The pen-testing market, too, exists due to the demand for
it, with large organizations investing in making their networks safer.

The results
Optimizing the chain — smaller teams
These structural shifts (rising vulnerabilities costs, moving to cloud servers, accessibility of
already developed advanced offensive tools) has led to cybergangs shrinking. Essentially,
the attack chain has been optimized with many roles having been outsourced, and teams
becoming more agile.
System administrators that take care of physical networks are no longer needed — with
cloud services management being an easy task. Cybercriminal gangs have also essentially
put a stop to developing their own malicious software. If before, large cybercriminal groups
would invest in their own malware and therefore staff at the very least two developers to work
on different parts of the malware (for instance client and server side), now they only need an
operator. If developers are not needed, neither are testers. The long attack chain that
included exploits for different vulnerabilities has also shrunk — and so exploit writers that
focused on client side have been put out of business.
Buying traffic for malicious sites has transformed into buying data — access to different
organizations, account information, etc. These services, too, have been outsourced.
As a result, for a successfully running operation in 2021, a cybergang needs management,
malware operators, specialists in gaining network access and financial specialists that take
care of extracting and cashing out the stolen funds.

8/13

Then and now: a comparison of how cybercrime groups looked in 2016 vs 2021
We are yet to see what will happen to those cybercriminals who were jailed in 2016-2017
and will be released into a world where their skillsets are no longer in demand. It is hard to
tell whether they will settle for an honest path, but if not, there are no vacancies for them in
the current dark cybermarket.

Change of targets
The year 2016 saw banks in Russia hacked one after another. It was also a time when
regular users had their devices infected and goods stolen. As time went by, and big gangs
that targeted financial institutions were ambushed, Russian-speaking cybercriminals
switched to other industries, attacking both large and small businesses. By 2018, however,
they had realized that it is far more profitable to target organizations — with ransomware,
stealers or remote access tools for conducting financial operations from within the networks.
In 2020, we witnessed a drop in cases against financial institutions in Russia. Incidents that
included banking software pretty much left the stage. There were a few reasons for this: new
local financial security regulations and enhanced banking security. But, most importantly,
cybercriminals switched to targets in the West. We cannot confirm that the operators of
attacks against financial institutions are the same people that now operate in ransomware
9/13

gangs, yet it is safe to assume that cybercriminals who had been put out of a job switched to
new, juicier targets. We did a separate review of the Russian-language ransomware
ecosystem earlier this year, so we will not go in length about them here.
Western organizations are chosen by cybercriminals not for ideological reasons. First,
organizations located in Europe and the US have more funds, and the potential for profit is
higher than in the case of infecting a Russian company. For instance, for international
companies, ransom demands start from 700 thousand USD and can go up to 7 million USD.
When attacking Russian organizations, the ransomware gangs start their demands from 100
thousand. On average, ransomware operators end up getting a ransom ranging from 50 to
100 thousand USD. Widespread use of English also makes companies more susceptible to
attacks.
At the same time, the shift to the West does not mean that Russian companies are no longer
being attacked from within the country. Criminals are still mostly limited by linguistic
constraints — it is much easier to prepare phishing emails and documents in their native
language. This is the only advantage of Russian-speaking hackers when attacking Russian
companies. Such choice of targets, however, entails higher risks for the cybercriminals — the
likelihood of them being discovered and arrested is greater.
Industry-wise, cybercriminals are no longer limited to financial institutions. The advent of
botnets created a market of network access — companies from all types of industries are
broken into without particular targeting, and access to them is later sold off on the dark web.
The pandemic also played a role in boosting it, with companies moving much of their
infrastructure online and opening it up to remote workers, leading to a wider attack surface
and more ways to hack into otherwise better-protected networks. Quite often, ransomware
operators go for the low-hanging fruit — companies that are easiest to break into and get
some profit off. Another big focus is organizations and users that possess or operate
cryptocurrency — cryptoexchanges, cryptowallets and others are among the juicy targets.
Some trends and attacks are purely local and tied to the Russian language. For instance,
somewhat surprisingly, since 2019 vishing (voice phishing, i.e. phone scams) has enjoyed a
renaissance. Russia’s mature mobile banking industry coupled with IP-telephone
technologies made it very easy and profitable to set up hard-to-trace call centers that scam
regular users out of their money. As a result, the damage for regular Russian users amounts
to about 1 billion rubles (13.8 million USD) monthly.

Services in demand
The world of dark-web marketplaces has also transformed. While, indeed, there still are a
few popular platforms where cybercriminals can meet and offer their services, serious
players are moving more and more to the shadows. A prime example of that is ransomware

10/13

operators, who have been expelled from popular dark-web platforms due to the heightened
interest in their activities. Now, they tend to communicate privately. The availability of secure
messengers also played a role, as cybercriminals connect directly, not via forums.
We no longer see vulnerabilities or exploits for sale on the dark web, as truly valuable
vulnerabilities, such as 0-day ones, are rare and sold directly to select customers, while 1day vulnerabilities are sold to agencies that specialize in them.
Still, many services remain in demand on the dark web and offers for them can still be found
without much effort. Let’s go over the key services cybercriminals use:
Ready-made accounts — using online services such as clouds requires
cybercriminals to have emails and phone numbers, and for obvious reasons making
their own is not safe enough. Prepaid SIM cards are illegal in Russia — all users must
register SIM cards to their ID. Therefore, emails bundled with phone numbers are
always in demand.
Access to logins — besides the regular phone+email combination, cybercriminals
offer stolen credentials for all types of accounts — from gaming and streaming
accounts to banking and other services. These credentials can be used for a whole
variety of activities — from scams to extraction of funds.
Access to organizations — perhaps the most attractive type of offer. Many operators
specialize solely in infecting networks en masse via botnets or through exploiting 1-day
vulnerabilities. Having gained access to a company network, they assess the
attractiveness of the company and sell access to other cybercriminals, who then work
on harvesting or encrypting the company’s data.
DDoS attacks — still in demand, albeit protection against DDoS attacks has become
stronger.
Personal data — the amount of personal data available on the dark web continues to
grow and diversify. The types of data have moved from card or ID data to rarer types,
such as medical information or full access to banking accounts. The price of this data
starts as low as 0.5 USD per item. We covered the type of data available on the dark
web in our previous report.

Conclusion: cybersecurity and cybercrime have matured
A few years back, the digital market was being tested by cybercriminals; radically new ways
of attacking users and organizations were being developed on a regular basis. Now, in 2021,
we have reached the point when the cybercriminal world has matured. So has cybersecurity
— just a few years ago organizations had little understanding of what dangers they face
online. Now, after waves of notorious and devastating attacks, people have become more
cautious, and organizations recognize the potential cyberrisks and invest in mitigating them.
Here are the main takeaways from this overview of the state of Russian-speaking
cybercrime:

11/13

Information has become more accessible and that includes malware. Malicious
tools are available online in abundance — be it leaked or released source code of
infamous malware developed by now-gone cybergangs, or legal instruments used for
pen-testing by organizations. This accessibility benefits cybercriminals, as they no
longer need to invest time and resources in writing malware from scratch.
Cybergangs as we knew them are gone. People in cybercrime are less and less tied
to each other, and no longer exist in stable groups that last many years.
Cybergangs operate like small businesses that deliver various services. People in
cybercrime have become very effective at outsourcing — focusing on purchasing
access to hacked organizations and the right tools to exploit that access. They no
longer need to write malware, nor take care of physical servers.
Russian-speaking cybercrime has also moved across the borders. As the digital
world lacks traditional borders, the limitations of potential targets are dictated by the
language cybercriminals speak; thus, the English-speaking part of the world will always
remain appealing. It would be presumptuous to say that back in 2016 Russianspeaking cybercriminals did not attack users abroad, or that they completely ceased to
attack their fellow nationals. Nevertheless, the clampdown by law enforcement of those
who attack organizations within Russia and much higher potential profit from attacks on
international organizations has solidified the “do not work in RU” rule and brought
Russian-speaking cybercriminals under the spotlight of the international arena.
Everyone is a target now. With so many organizations facing the Internet, the attack
surface has grown immensely, and gaining access to organizations has become easier.
Cybercriminals are ready to lay their hands on pretty much any organization, as
opposed to their past focus on financial organizations. With ransomware, every victim
can bring profit to a cybergang.
Data remains a valuable asset. The current state of personal data security paints a
gloomy picture. Regardless of the current, though significant, efforts made by various
governments, personal data continues to end up online, and used for attacks — be it a
tool to register a server for a cybergang or a point of access to an organization. This is
unlikely to change in the near future.
All in all, the current state of Russian-speaking cybercrime reveals problems in cybersecurity
of global relevance. In the “shared” cybercriminal economy, tracking specific gangs has
become harder, while the gangs themselves have ceased to be well-defined entities, turning
into rather scattered groups of individuals with the right tools, which are easy to access.
What we as cybersecurity experts can do is strive to be a step ahead — and continue to
build defenses, educate people and make cybersecurity front-of-mind for everyone.
