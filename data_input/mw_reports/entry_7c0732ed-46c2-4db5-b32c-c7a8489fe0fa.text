In 2020, CrowdStrike Services observed the continued evolution and proliferation of eCrime
adversaries engaging in big game hunting (BGH) ransomware techniques. This trend is
continuing into 2021 — a recent high-profile example is the CARBON SPIDER/DarkSide
attack on a U.S. fuel pipeline.
BGH was first observed by CrowdStrike in 2016 with the introduction of BOSS SPIDER’s
Samas (aka SamSam) ransomware. Since then, BGH ransomware variants have multiplied,
evolved and become more sophisticated, with their proliferation going virtually unimpeded by
legacy endpoint security tools.
The year 2020 was marked by the trend continuing at an accelerated rate. The
advancements by eCrime actors include refinement and application of high-pressure
extortion tactics on victim organizations and the sharing or copying of new techniques among
different ransomware groups, in addition to a marked increase in the number of ransomware
variants. These advancements all but ensure that ransomware will remain a popular method
for eCrime actors to monetize breaches in the foreseeable future.

Ransomware Actors Increase Pressure
CrowdStrike Services observed eCrime adversaries utilizing various techniques to increase
pressure on victim organizations to pay their extortion. While in previous years ransomware
eCrime adversaries were rarely observed exfiltrating data, 2020 witnessed a widespread
adoption of ransomware with data-leak extortion tactics among multiple eCrime groups. This
method involves both encrypting a victim organization’s environment and also exfiltrating
data with the threat to leak it if the extortion demand is not paid. This tactic was initially
observed by CrowdStrike Intelligence with OUTLAW SPIDER in May 2019. However, it was
not until November 2019, when TWISTED SPIDER adopted this technique, that it became a
catalyst for multiple other eCrime actors, many of which have created dedicated leak sites to
threaten exfiltration and distribute data. CrowdStrike Intelligence performed research on
known dedicated leak sites for 2020. The results of this analysis depict growth throughout
the year in terms of the number of leak sites and the number of victim entities with data
published on the leak sites.

In engagements involving eCrime adversaries that use ransomware with data-leak extortion,
CrowdStrike Services is regularly asked to perform incident response investigations to assist
stakeholders by identifying data that was accessed and exfiltrated by threat actors.

Frequently, CrowdStrike Services is able to identify the data exfiltrated prior to publication by
the eCrime adversary, thereby giving stakeholders an opportunity to prepare.
Not only has the number of eCrime dedicated leak sites grown, threat actors have also
become more sophisticated in their methods of leaking the data. In general, eCrime
adversaries will leak exfiltrated data slowly, saving what they perceive to be the most
sensitive data for last in an effort to increase pressure on the victim organization to pay the
extortion, rather than posting all of the exfiltrated data at once. PINCHY SPIDER’s dedicated
leak site frequently holds auctions to sell exfiltrated data. Others, such as DOPPEL
SPIDER’s leak site, utilize a countdown timer that triggers an increase in the ransom demand
upon each expiration. CARBON SPIDER’s leak site automatically releases data on a pre-set
timer, with the least sensitive data leaked first and the most sensitive leaked last. There are
also significant differences in the amount of data exfiltrated by threat actors. CrowdStrike
Services has observed DOPPEL SPIDER frequently exfiltrating only tens of gigabytes, while
others — such as TRAVELING SPIDER and affiliates associated with Nemty X ransomware
— exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data or more from victim organizations.
In addition to ransomware with data-leak extortion, CrowdStrike Services has identified
additional tactics by eCrime adversaries to increase pressure on the victim to pay the
ransom. During several recent incidents, the eCrime adversaries, after deploying
ransomware to the victim organization’s environment, have utilized stolen credentials to gain
access to the victim organization’s email instance to send extortion-related emails to users
demanding payment to prevent exfiltrated data from being leaked. In other instances, the
eCrime adversaries have called and harassed employees of a victim organization following
ransomware deployment. Finally, CrowdStrike also observed threat actors increase pressure
for payment with credible threats of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks if ransom
payment is not received.

Ecrime Adversaries Collaborate
CrowdStrike has observed formal collaboration among eCrime adversaries as well as shared
tactics. In June 2020, the self-named “Maze Cartel” was created when TWISTED SPIDER,
VIKING SPIDER and the operators of LockBit ransomware entered into an apparent
collaborative business arrangement. After this occurred, leaks associated with VIKING
SPIDER’s Ragnar Locker began appearing on TWISTED SPIDER’s dedicated leak site and
Maze ransomware began deploying ransomware using common virtualization software, a
tactic originally pioneered by VIKING SPIDER.
In addition to formal collaboration, CrowdStrike Services has observed new tactics used and
spread among eCrime actors. One such tactic is the development and deployment of an ELF
ransomware binary that can be deployed to ESXi hosts for the purpose of encrypting virtual
systems. This tactic was initially observed being used by SPRITE SPIDER’s Defray777
ransomware in August 2020 and was quickly adopted by CARBON SPIDER, which utilized a

similar tactic weeks later. In addition, multiple eCrime adversaries share common exfiltration
techniques. CrowdStrike has observed multiple eCrime adversaries exfiltrating data through
MegaSync as well as Rclone, an open-source computer program.

What To Expect Next
Over the last several years, eCrime adversaries that engage in BGH ransomware have
advanced rapidly in terms of their capabilities and sophistication. It is reasonable to expect
that this trend will continue at an accelerated rate with the same goal in mind — to apply as
much pressure as possible to organizations to pay ever-larger extortion demands.
CrowdStrike expects that eCrime adversaries will continue to refine their data-leak extortion
ransomware tactics, develop increasingly sophisticated exfiltration tooling that can be
deployed widely, and automate data exfiltration by searching for, identifying and exfiltrating
sensitive data by keyword.
Lastly, CrowdStrike expects eCrime adversaries to continue pursuing targets of opportunity.
Frequently, these are SMBs that rely heavily on legacy antivirus to protect them, but many
large organizations are being hit frequently, as threat actors see a higher return on
4/6

investment when targeting an organization that may have stronger defenses but is also likely
to pay a higher ransom demand.

What Can Be Done?
Why is ransomware so prevalent? In short, ransomware with data extortion remains a
lucrative tactic for eCrime adversaries to monetize their presence in a victim organization’s
network. Fueled by increasingly larger ransom demands, eCrime adversaries continue to
develop tactics and tools that allow them to slip past legacy antivirus virtually unnoticed.
Following a ransomware incident, many organizations may find that they do not have
adequate backups, or that their backups became encrypted, and they have few options but
to pay the ransom. In addition, some cyber insurance companies, during cost-benefit
analysis, may find that paying the ransom is a less costly option than rebuilding systems and
incurring credit monitoring and legal fees due to the disclosure of regulated data by an
eCrime adversary.

CrowdStrike recommends the following practices:
Build a bulletproof backup strategy. When it comes to ransomware, how you’ve
configured your backups is critical. Attackers often delete backups before deploying
ransomware so you are more inclined to pay. Some steps to consider include
purchasing an immutable backup solution, using separate non-domain accounts with
multi-factor authentication to administer your backup solution, retaining multiple copies
of data on different media with one of them being off-site, keeping at least one copy of
your backups offline or on an otherwise air-gapped network, and closely monitoring
your backup solution for evidence of data exfiltration, whether it’s on-premises or in the
cloud. eCrime adversaries have publicly boasted about utilizing cloud backups for data
exfiltration, and CrowdStrike recommends taking steps to prevent threat actors from
accessing cloud backup infrastructure in the event of a compromise. This can involve
using non-domain accounts for cloud management and multi-factor authentication.
Use multi-factor authentication. Organizations can improve their security posture by
enabling multi-factor authentication on all public-facing employee services and portals
as well as restricting internet-facing protocols such as RDP and Server Message Block.
This will inhibit unauthorized access to the organization’s environment.
Implement next-generation endpoint protection. Organizations can improve their
security posture by utilizing advanced endpoint protection across their environment.
The agent should leverage machine learning to identify anomalies and perform
heuristic analysis, in addition to conducting antivirus and anti-malware activities in real
time. The agent should be capable of detection and prevention, allow for remote
network containment of assets pending investigation and/or remediation, and detect
unmanaged assets within the corporate environment.

Know when to ask for help. In some instances, organizations become aware of threat
actor activity within their environment but may lack the visibility to address the problem
or the right intelligence to understand the nature of the threat. Getting educated about
the latest threats and knowing when to ask for help by activating an incident response
team or retainer, such as those offered by CrowdStrike Services, may allow for
detection and remediation before the threat actor is able to deploy ransomware or
exfiltrate data from the environment.
