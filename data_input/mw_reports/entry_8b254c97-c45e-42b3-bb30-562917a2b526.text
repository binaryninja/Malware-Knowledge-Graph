Introduction
In December 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
took action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group INDRIK SPIDER, also known as Evil
Corp, a sophisticated eCrime (ECX 357.19) adversary notorious for conducting numerous
schemes against a variety of targets beginning in 2014. This adversary is best known for their
Dridex banking trojan, which was prolific from June 2014 through early 2020, and their
Bitpaymer crypter used in big game hunting (BGH) attacks beginning in 2017. The OFAC action
consisted of sanctions that prohibit the facilitation of significant payments to the organization,
such as those involved in BGH ransom payments.
In addition to OFAC’s action against INDRIK SPIDER, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
charged two key members of the group — Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev — with criminal
infringements, and the U.S. Department of State announced a reward of up to $5 million USD
for any information leading to the capture or conviction of INDRIK SPIDER’s leader.

Following the OFAC sanctions and the unsealing of the indictment, INDRIK SPIDER went
through significant periods of downtime and continued to develop their MO, TTPs and tradecraft
in an attempt to evade the sanctions placed upon them — the latest evolution is Hades, which
first reared its head after the OFAC action was announced.

INDRIK SPIDER’s Reaction
Subsequent to the announcement of the sanctions against the group, INDRIK SPIDER
disappeared for a short while until reappearing in January 2020, when BitPaymer was once
again observed being used in a BGH operation against a victim conglomerate spanning
multiple verticals. This BitPaymer operation was one of the first identified examples of INDRIK
SPIDER using a variant of Gozi ISFB as a part of their toolset instead of their Dridex banking
trojan.
Following a short hiatus from March to May 2020, INDRIK SPIDER significantly increased their
efforts to move away from their existing tools and introduced WastedLocker — the successor to
their BitPaymer ransomware. Approximately six months after the OFAC sanctions and the
unsealing of the indictment against Yakubets and Turashev, WastedLocker was used in the first
BGH campaign, marking a new era for INDRIK SPIDER, as they also began using a variant of
Gozi ISFB in their operations. This further operational shift was highly likely an attempt to
distance themselves from their infamous Dridex and BitPaymer tools.
In June 2020, the trend of moving away from their typical infection chain continued, and INDRIK
SPIDER began using fake browser updates to deliver the Cobalt Strike red-teaming tool.
INDRIK SPIDER extensively used Cobalt Strike to establish an initial foothold and move
laterally within the victim network. Once control over the enterprise environment was
established, WastedLocker would subsequently be executed in their BGH campaigns. INDRIK
SPIDER continued with their usual operational tempo, infecting organizations across more than
a dozen sectors — predominantly in the U.S. — until late 2020.

WastedLocker to Hades Evolution
Based on significant code overlap, CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified Hades ransomware
as INDRIK SPIDER’s successor to WastedLocker. Hades ransomware — first publicly identified
by security researchers in December 2020 — was named for a Tor hidden website that victims
are instructed to visit; however, Hades is merely a 64-bit compiled variant of WastedLocker with
additional code obfuscation and minor feature changes. The WastedLocker-derived Hades
ransomware is unrelated to a similarly named ransomware family, Hades Locker, identified by
security firms in 2016.
Hades ransomware shares the majority of its functionality with WastedLocker; the ISFB-inspired
static configuration, multi-staged persistence/installation process, file/directory enumeration and
encryption functionality are largely unchanged. Hades did receive minor modifications, and the
removed features included those that were uniquely characteristic of INDRIK SPIDER’s

previous ransomware families — WastedLocker and BitPaymer. At the time of this publication,
CrowdStrike has identified the following changes INDRIK SPIDER made to the WastedLockerderived Hades ransomware variant:
Hades is now a 64-bit compiled executable with additional code-obfuscation, likely to
disguise the minimal changes, evade existing signature-based detections and hinder
reverse engineering efforts.
The majority of standard file and registry Windows API calls were replaced with their
system call counterparts (i.e., the user-mode Native APIs exported from NTDLL).
Hades employs a different User Account Control (UAC) bypass than WastedLocker;
however, both implementations are taken directly from the open-source UACME project
(https[:]//github[.]com/hfiref0x/UACME).
Hades writes a single ransom note named HOW-TO-DECRYPT-[extension].txt to
traversed directories, as opposed to WastedLocker’s and BitPaymer’s approach of
creating a note for each encrypted file.
Hades ransomware now stores the key information in each encrypted file rather than the
ransom note. Both WastedLocker and BitPaymer stored the encoded and encrypted key
information in the file-specific ransom notes.
While Hades still copies itself to a generated subdirectory in Application Data , it no
longer uses the :bin Alternate Data Stream (ADS). The use of the :bin ADS path
was characteristic of both WastedLocker and BitPaymer.
INDRIK SPIDER’s move to this ransomware variant also came with another shift in tactics: the
departure from using email communication and the possibility of exfiltrating data from victims to
elicit payments. The Hades ransom note (shown in Figure 1) directs victims to a Tor hidden site.
The identified ransom notes do not identify the victim company, as was often observed with
WastedLocker and BitPaymer.

The Tor website (shown in Figure 2) is unique for each victim and states that data has been
exfiltrated from their network. The only provided means of contact is a Tox-identifier for
communication with the Tox peer-to-peer instant messenger (https[:]//tox[.]chat/)

Conclusion
Since the OFAC sanctions and DOJ indictments against the group and its members, INDRIK
SPIDER’s continued diversification has demonstrated the group’s significant resources and
operational resilience. INDRIK SPIDER’s ability to adapt and overcome adversity has been
illustrated in their continual advances in their campaigns, implementation of new tools, and
adoption of third-party products and services. The development of their tradecraft has almost
certainly been prompted by the legal action taken against them. The continued development of
WastedLocker ransomware is the latest attempt by the notorious adversary to distance
themselves from known tooling to aid them in bypassing the sanctions imposed upon them. The
sanctions and indictments have undoubtedly significantly impacted the group and have made it
difficult for INDRIK SPIDER to successfully monetize their criminal endeavors.
