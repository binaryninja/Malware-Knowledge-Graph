Bumblebee: New Loader Rapidly Assuming Central
Position in Cyber-crime Ecosystem
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/bumblebee-loader-cybercrime

Bumblebee, a recently developed malware loader, has quickly become a key component in a
wide range of cyber-crime attacks and appears to have replaced a number of older loaders,
which suggests that it is the work of established actors and that the transition to Bumblebee
was pre-planned.
By analysis of three other tools used in recent attacks involving Bumblebee, Symantec’s
Threat Hunter team, a part of Broadcom Software, has linked this tool to a number of
ransomware operations including Conti, Quantum, and Mountlocker. The tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) used in these older attacks support the hypothesis that Bumblebee
may have been introduced as a replacement loader for Trickbot and BazarLoader, since
there is some overlap between recent activity involving Bumblebee and older attacks linked
to these loaders.

Bumblebee and Quantum: Bumblebee’s role in ransomware delivery
A recent attack involving the Quantum ransomware demonstrates how Bumblebee is now
being leveraged by attackers to deliver ransomware.

1/10

The initial infection vector was a spear-phishing email with an attachment containing an ISO
file. This ISO file contained a Bumblebee DLL file and an LNK file, which loaded the
Bumblebee DLL file using rundll32.exe.
rundll32.exe teas.dll,kXlNkCKgFC
Bumblebee supports multiple commands like “Ins” for bot persistence, “Dij” for DLL injection,
and “Dex” for downloading executables.
Bumblebee contacted a command-and-control (C&C) server (45.153.243.93) and created a
copy in the %APPDATA% folder with a random name, and also created a VBS file at the
same location to load the %APPDATA% DLL file.
A scheduled task was created using the Bumblebee “Ins” command to run a VBS file every
15 minutes.
wscript.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\e147c18f9167cd0f\f30b25c870238567.vbs
CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe"
CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\e147c18f9167cd0f\f30b25c870238567.dll
After a couple of hours, Bumblebee used the “Dex” command to drop and run a Cobalt Strike
payload named “wab.exe” in the %APPDATA% location. It also ran the “systeminfo”
command.
wmiprvse.exe --> wab.exe
wmiprvse.exe --> wab.exe --> cmd.exe /C systeminfo
Using the “Dij” command, Bumblebee then injected the Metasploit DLL into the legitimate
process “ImagingDevices.exe”, which is a Windows Photo Viewer executable file.
In addition to this, using the “Dij” command Bumblebee injected the Cobalt Strike payload
into the legitimate “wab.exe”, which is a Windows Mail executable file.
Bumblebee then dropped the AdFind tool using the “Dij” command and tried to enumerate
domain-related information like domain trust, domain users, domain groups, and group
permissions, etc.
At this point, Bumblebee dropped the Quantum ransomware using the “Dij” command. The
attacker used both DLL and EXE payloads to encrypt files.
rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\2429189468.dll,start \shareall \nolog
CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\2431789750.exe /shareall /NOLOG

Quantum collects system information and user information using WMI. It also checks for
SQL-related services and stops them if found running. Quantum also checks for some
processes related to malware analysis like procmon, wireshark, cmd, task manager, and
notepad, and terminates them if found running.

Link 1: The AdFind connection
Tools used in recent Bumblebee attacks have appeared in older attacks, pre-dating
Bumblebee’s appearance. In a number of attacks involving Bumblebee beginning in mid-May
2022, a version of AdFind (SHA256:
b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682) was also
deployed by the attackers. AdFind is a publicly available tool for querying Active Directory
and has been widely used by a range of threat actors in recent years.
Similar to the previously mentioned example, malicious ISO files attached to phishing emails
were the initial infection vector, with the attackers deploying legitimate ConnectWise remote
desktop software (formerly known as ScreenConnect), along with Atera, another legitimate
remote access tool, and Meterpreter, a Metasploit in-memory payload that provides a
reverse shell to the attacker. In all cases, the attacks never reached the payload stage.
However, similarities TTPs used in other attacks suggest that ransomware was the intended
payload.
This version of AdFind used in these recent Bumblebee attacks has appeared in attacks
dating back as far as June 2021, where it was being used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike to
deliver the Avaddon ransomware.
In August 2021, it reappeared during an unsuccessful ransomware attack when it was used
alongside a number of other legitimate software packages including AnyDesk, a publicly
available remote desktop tool; Splashtop, another remote desktop tool; and 7-Zip, the
publicly available archiving tool. The attack was halted before a ransomware payload could
be deployed.
During another abortive ransomware attack in May 2022, this variant of AdFind was also
deployed. Again, the attackers used Atera in conjunction with Splashtop and AnyDesk. The
widely used credential dumping tools Mimikatz and LaZagne were deployed, along with the
NetScan network scanner. The attackers also made use of a PowerShell script named cve2021-34527.ps1 that has previously been linked to Conti’s leaked attack playbook.
This version of AdFind also appeared in attacks involving Quantum ransomware during May
2022. The attackers also used Cobalt Strike; Ligolo, a publicly available tunneling tool
created for penetration testing purposes, but which has been used by a number of espionage

and ransomware actors; ProcDump for credential dumping; along with Rclone, a legitimate
open-source tool that can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud, but is
frequently used by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data.
More recently, this same version of AdFind was used in an attack attempting to deliver the
Diavol payload. The initial loader used by the attackers was not discovered, but the AdFind
link with Bumblebee activity suggests it may have been used by the attackers.

Link 2: adf.bat
In early June 2022, Bumblebee was used in a thwarted attack. Although the payload wasn’t
deployed, the TTPs used suggested ransomware. The attackers made use of a batch script
called adf.bat (SHA256:
1e7737a57552b0b32356f5e54dd84a9ae85bb3acff05ef5d52aabaa996282dfb) along the
previously mentioned version of AdFind (SHA256:
b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682) and another
version of AdFind (SHA256:
9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda).
This adf.bat script has been used in attacks since at least 2021. In September 2021, for
example, the file was deployed in what appeared to be an attempted ransomware attack. It
was used in conjunction with the previously mentioned version of AdFind (SHA256:
b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682); Cobalt Strike;
and PowerSploit, an exploitation framework originally developed for penetration testing.
The script was also used in another thwarted ransomware attack in November 2021, again
alongside the previously mentioned version of AdFind. Once again the attackers used a
number of publicly available tools, including Atera agent and Splashtop, along with Cobalt
Strike. While the delivery mechanism wasn’t uncovered, some of the infrastructure used had
been previously linked to infrastructure used by BazarLoader, which along with Trickbot, was
one of the primary pieces of malware used by the Miner cyber-crime group (aka Wizard
Spider). Both were frequently used as part of the delivery mechanism for the group’s
ransomware families: Ryuk and Conti.

Link 3: find.exe/adfind.exe
A third version of AdFind (SHA256:
9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda) has also
been used in recent attacks involving Bumblebee. This tool has been used in ransomware
attacks for at least a year.

4/10

In May 2021, it was used alongside Cobalt Strike in an attempted ransomware attack against
a large electronics organization. One feature of this attack was that the attackers installed a
VirtualBox VM on some compromised computers. While a VM image was not retrieved, it
appeared that the ransomware payload was located on the VM and ran once the operating
system was fully booted. The VM likely had access to the host computer’s files and
directories (via "SharedFolders" set up by runner.exe), allowing it to encrypt files on the host
computer. While the payload wasn’t identified, there were some links to both the Conti and
Mountlocker ransomware operations.
In another May 2021 attack it was again used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike in another
abortive ransomware attack against an organization in the U.S. While the payload was not
deployed, some of the TTPs had links to earlier Conti attacks.
Also in May 2021, this version of AdFind was leveraged along with Cobalt Strike in an attack
against an organization in Canada. In this case, the Conti ransomware was used.

Increase in use of legitimate software
Aside from Bumblebee’s links to a range of ransomware attacks, another commonality
between many of the attacks investigated is the preponderance of legitimate software tools
now being deployed during ransomware attacks. Remote desktop tools such as
ConnectWise, Atera, Splashtop, and AnyDesk frequently feature in ransomware
investigations, in addition to Rclone, which is now widely leveraged for data exfiltration
purposes.
More recently, Symantec has seen attackers using the AvosLocker ransomware leveraging
PDQ Deploy in their attacks. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software package that allows users
to manage patching on multiple software packages in addition to deploying custom scripts.
At least one affiliate of AvosLocker is now using it to execute malicious PowerShell
commands on multiple computers on victims’ networks using PowerShell Empire to deploy
the AvosLocker payload.

The Bumblebee threat
Bumblebee’s links to a number of high-profile ransomware operations suggest that it is now
at the epicenter of the cyber-crime ecosystem. Any organization that discovers a Bumblebee
infection on its network should treat this incident with high priority since it could be the
pathway to several dangerous ransomware threats.

Indicators of Compromise
If an IOC is malicious and the file is available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect
and block that file.
