Philadelphia Ransomware Brings Customization to Commodity Malware

April 25, 2017 Proofpoint Staff
Overview
Philadelphia ransomware is a relatively new ransomware variant, first observed in September of last
year. Designed as an easy-to-use piece of malicious software with low barriers to entry for new
ransomware actors, Philadelphia is simple to customize and deploy. Although we most often associate
ransomware, including Philadelphia, with large-scale, "spray and pray" campaigns that send high
message volumes to a wide spectrum of consumers and organizations, we are beginning to see
significant differentiation among attacks, ransoms, scale, and even targeting.
In this blog, we focus on a recent Philadelphia ransomware campaign used in a series of targeted email
attacks against a small number of organizations using lures and attachments highly customized for the
targeted organizations. In addition to explicit targeting, recent attacks using Philadelphia highlight the
ability to customize what is essentially commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) malware, personalizing aspects
of attacks such as the ransom note and ransom amounts.
Analysis
Since late last month, we have seen actors using Philadelphia to target specific healthcare institutions,
among other organizations in the same city. In this case, email messages purporting to be from an
employee at a targeted company with subjects such as "Patient Referral" contained bit.do (URL
shortener) links leading to the download of Philadelphia.

Although redacted in Figure 1, the use of so-called "display name spoofing" to make the emails appear
to be from internal senders is a technique commonly associated with targeted attacks and has been on
the rise among business email compromise (BEC) actors.
Additionally, the actor took an extra step to customize the ransom note by:
(1) Calling out the potential victim organization by name
(2) Setting the ransom to a high amount of 15 Bitcoins (approximately $18,000 USD) and
(3) Threatening to delete 99 files every 45 minutes

Ransom Note Customizations
We determined that the demanded ransom amount is configurable and is returned in the command and
control (C&C) server response to the initial check-in beacon by the victim machine. The Bitcoin address
and victim ID are returned in the same response. However, this is the first instance of ransom note
customization we have observed with Philadelphia ransomware. This customization occurs through a
setting that is built into the malware itself. Examining our malware corpus, we found several other
instances of ransom note customization for Philadelphia ransomware, tailored to a variety of different
situations.
In one case, the ransom note was colored pink and included a small payoff amount of 0.05 Bitcoins.
The note threatened the victim, claiming “YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED!” and that three files will be
deleted every hour, ostensibly as a consequence for browsing pornography. At this time, we have not
determined how this particular instance of Philadelphia ransomware was spread to potential victims.

In another case, we found a sample with a Russian-language ransom note. The English translation
(see full text in Appendix A) told victims “Do not write to us if you do not like the price. We do not
bargain.”

Delivery
As in the healthcare-targeted campaign, we have seen Philadelphia ransomware spreading via URLs
linking to zipped executables in email. A related healthcare campaign from the same actor also
targeted hospitals with URLs, but in that case led to macro-laden Microsoft Word documents.
We also found a sample of a Microsoft Word document named CV.doc (Figure 5) that used macros and
Powershell to download Philadelphia from a payload site.

final payload
It appears that Philadelphia is also spread via keygen and cracking sites as we found samples of the
ransomware bundled with various keygen programs and Bitcoin-related software.

program
Finally, we have also observed Philadelphia being distributed via Sundown and RIG exploit kits.
Configuration File
As noted above, a server-side script controls several parameters, including the ransom amount. In
Figure 8, this parameter is set to 0.2 Bitcoins. The “confirmations” parameter, shown with the value “3”,
appears to be the number of times the victim has to confirm that he or she paid the ransom.

Figure 9: The server response to the initial victim check-in returns the victim ID, followed by a Bitcoin
address (highlighted) and then by the ransom amount. In this case, the amount is 0.2 as specified in
the configuration file.
Conclusion
While geographically targeted ransomware has been a part of the threat landscape for some time,
targeting of ransomware at specific companies or verticals has been rare. As these recent Philadelphia
ransomware examples show, even ‘entry-level’ ransomware is adopting the techniques of targeted
email-based attacks, including:
Email lures and attachment filenames customized for the targeted organization
Spoofing to make it appear that the message was sent internally
Customized payment amounts, deletion schedules, ransom messages, languages, and even
colors per organization.
These targeted campaigns are carried out even as we continue to observe broad-based distribution of
Philadelphia ransomware through both email and web-based attacks.
Ransomware can be quite lucrative for threat actors in broad-based campaigns where actors generally
rely on high volumes and relatively low ransoms to monetize ransomware. However, healthcare
organizations are becoming a favorite for more targeted, higher-ransom attacks as well. Philadelphia

ransomware in particular is not considered especially sophisticated in its coding or encryption but is
notable for being an early example of "commodity ransomware", sold cheaply for widespread use
among various threat actors. We have also observed cracked versions of Philadelphia in the wild that
do not require any upfront costs for would-be ransomware actors.
Changes in the ransomware landscape are not limited to Philadelphia. For example, we have recently
observed narrow-spread Sage ransomware campaigns being delivered to small numbers of
organizations in a few verticals. On the other hand, Locky returned to large-scale distribution recently
but in sporadic campaigns using new distribution vectors and demanding a higher ransom. In our
recent first quarter Threat Report, we highlighted the continued rapid growth of ransomware variants in
the wild. While many of these new variants fail to gain traction, others come with new approaches and
features.

As commodity ransomware becomes more sophisticated and customizable, new strains emerge
rapidly, and ransomware-as-a-service becomes more commonplace, the possibilities for threat actors to
use this type of malware in unexpected ways increase. Organizations need to adopt robust strategies
to stop ransomware messages at the door as effective attacks can have major financial impacts, both
directly in terms of large ransoms and indirectly in terms of time, productivity, and effectiveness.
