QUESTION 1
Recent as of 4/6/2021
If I’ve upgraded to Orion Platform versions 2019.4.2, 2020.2.4, or 2020.2.5, am I affected by SUNBURST or SUPERNOVA?
Orion Platform versions 2019.4.2 and 2020.2.4 were designed to protect you from both SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA—and have also
been digitally re-signed with our newly obtained digital code-signing certificates.
Orion Platform version 2020.2.5 adds to these enhancements with additional security fixes and protections. We recommend you upgrade to
the latest available release (2020.2.5) as soon as is practical. For more information, review the Release Notes here, and KB article here.
If you have recently upgraded to 2020.2.1 HF2 or 2019.4 HF 6, you are also protected from SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA. However, as
part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software versions
was revoked March 8, 2021, and you may experience performance issues if you do not apply the more recent updates. Please visit our
SolarWinds New Digital Code-Signing Certificate page atsolarwinds.com/trust-center/new-digital-certificate for more information.

QUESTION 2
Recent as of 4/6/2021
Am I safe if I disconnect my Orion server from the internet?
Disconnecting any product from the internet can reduce your attack surface. The Orion Platform is fully functional without an internet
connection. Based on our investigations to date, SUNBURST requires an internet connection to be activated and disconnecting your Orion
server from the internet should immediately protect your environment from SUNBURST. The vulnerability in the product that allows for the
deployment of SUPERNOVA, however, may still be exploited by a malicious actor who accesses your network from inside and not over the
internet. Disconnecting from the internet will limit the ability of an external actor exploiting this vulnerability over an internet connection.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Disconnecting from the internet is not a recommended substitute for upgrading your Orion software to versions 2019.4.2,
2020.2.4, or 2020.2.5, or applying appropriate patches to older versions if a full upgrade is not possible at this time.

QUESTION 3
Recent as of 4/6/2021
How has SolarWinds addressed SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA?
We have:
removed the software builds known to be affected by SUNBURST from our download sites;
provided software updates, which include security enhancements, that are designed to address both SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA in
supported versions of the Orion server; and
provided a fix for customers on unsupported versions further described below.
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
As part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software versions
was revoked March 8, 2021. Please visit our SolarWinds New Digital Code-Signing Certificate page atsolarwinds.com/trust-center/newdigital-certificate for more information.

We strongly encourage customers to upgrade their Orion products to the latest versions available in the Customer Portal at
customerportal.solarwinds.com that are designed to protect you from SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA. Doing so allows you to the get the full
benefit of our updates, improvements, and enhancements.
If you have already upgraded to 2020.2.5, additional security fixes and protections unrelated to SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA are
included in this version. For more information, review the Release Notes here, and KB article here.
If you have upgraded to 2020.2.4 or 2019.4 HF 2, both the SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA vulnerabilities have been addressed in these
versions—and they have also been digitally re-signed by newly obtained digital code-signing certificates.

* As a part of the ongoing investigation, we have determined that Orion Platform version 2019.4 unpatched, released in October 2019,
contained test modifications to the code base. While this version is not impacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability, it is the first version in which
we have seen activity from the attacker at this time. Subsequent releases 2019.4 HF 1, 2019.4 HF 2, 2019.4 HF 3, and 2019.4 HF 4 did not
include either test modifications contained in the 2019.4 version or the SUNBURST vulnerability contained in 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched,
and 2020.2 HF 1.
** If you apply a SUPERNOVA security patch per the above chart, please visit this KB article to validate the patch was applied to all Orion
Platform web servers. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to reapply the respective patch.
*** If you used the SUPERNOVA Mitigation Script to address the Supernova vulnerability, use the guidance in the document within that
package to confirm the temporary patch. Please note that this script has only been tested down to NPM 11.x. If you reinstall your Orion server,
you will need to reapply this script.
All recommended upgrade versions are currently available at customerportal.solarwinds.com. All hotfix updates are cumulative and can be
installed from any earlier version. There is no need to install previously released updates.
Based on our investigations to date, we are not aware that the SUNBURST vulnerability affects other versions of our Orion Platform
products. Also, while we are still investigating our non-Orion Platform products, we have not seen any evidence that they are
impacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability or the SUPERNOVA malware.

QUESTION 4
Recent as of 12/26/2020
Are SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA related?
While there has been speculation by various sources, based on our investigations to date, we do not have a definitive answer at this time.
SolarWinds continues to work closely with federal agencies and third-party cybersecurity firms to determine the answer.

QUESTION 5
Recent as of 1/29/2021
What are SUNSPOT, TEARDROP, and RAINDROP?
SUNSPOT, TEARDROP, and RAINDROP are NOT new vulnerabilities within our products as some reports in the media have indicated, but
instead, they are elements of the SUNBURST attack chain.
SUNSPOT, for example, is the means by which the attackers injected the SUNBURST backdoor during the build process of the Orion Platform,
while TEARDROP and RAINDROP are reportedly malware loaders that could be deployed using the SUNBURST backdoor.
QUESTION 6
Recent as of 1/13/2021
4/18

How is SolarWinds responding to these security vulnerabilities?
As announced by SolarWinds President and CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna in his Orange Matter blog, Our Plan for a Safer SolarWinds and
Customer Community, we are taking key steps to ensure the security and integrity of the software that we deliver to customers.
All new hotfixes and patches we have released since SUNBURST was detected have undergone these new levels of scrutiny. SolarWinds is
increasing existing actions and taking additional actions across the enterprise to further harden and improve the security of our environment
and products:
Increased hardening of build environment and build pipeline
Auditing and surveillance
Environmental reviews by third-party cybersecurity experts
Release code penetration testing (pentesting)
Increased scanning of downloadable bits
Scanning and analysis of source code and build output
Refreshing of all employee and contractor credentials and credential security and elevating access restriction
Re-signing of all release code with new certificates
In addition, we’re elevating our ongoing architectural focus on continually improving the way we design, build, and support our products.
QUESTION 7
Recent as of 4/6/2021
What actions should I take?
As part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software versions
was revoked March 8, 2021. Please visit our SolarWinds New Digital Code-Signing Certificate page atsolarwinds.com/trust-center/newdigital-certificate for more information.

We encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to the get the full benefit of
our updates, improvements and enhancements. The latest versions of our products are available in the Customer Portal at
customerportal.solarwinds.com. Based on our investigation, we recommend that all customers of Orion Platform products apply the latest
updates applicable to the version of the product they have deployed.

To take advantage of our latest available security updates protections for the products you have deployed, we recommend all active
maintenance customers of Orion Platform products upgrade to version 2020.2.5 as soon as possible. For more information, review the
Release Notes here, and KB article here.

Orion Platform versions 2019.4.2 and 2020.2.4 were designed to protect you from both the SUNBURST vulnerability and the SUPERNOVA
malware and have been re-signed with our newly obtained digital-signing certificate.
You may need to synchronize your license prior to applying the hotfix. Please follow the steps here to kick off the synchronization of your
license. If you have disabled outward communication from your Orion license, please follow the “Activate License Offline” section from
here. Once you have successfully synched your license, please run the installer to install the hotfix.
If you’re unable to upgrade at this time, we have provided a script that customers can install to temporarily protect their environment against
SUPERNOVA. The script is available at https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/Support/SupernovaMitigation.zip. If you reinstall your
Orion server, you will need to reapply this script.
We also recommend customers review our Secure Configuration for the Orion Platform guide here for additional best practices.
QUESTION 8
Recent as of 12/15/2020
How do I know what version I’m on?
If you aren’t sure which version of the Orion Platform products you’re using, you can see directions on how to check that here. To check which
hotfix updates you’ve applied, please go here.
QUESTION 9
Recent as of 12/24/2020

5/18

How do I know if my environment was exposed?
To get started, please review the Security Advisory page on our website, as we update it with the latest information. Next, determine if your
environment is at risk by verifying the version of the Orion Platform you have installed here, and verify which hotfix updates you have
installed here.
Once you’ve determined which version you have installed, go here to see what steps you should take.

QUESTION 10
Recent as of 12/18/2020
How do I upgrade my Orion Platform version?
Please watch this video to learn more about upgrading your version of the Orion Platform software.
QUESTION 11
Recent as of 12/16/2020
My antivirus software is alerting on the of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll – am I infected?
We’ve been advised some Endpoint Security tools are alerting on all versions of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll, including versions
that we do not believe were impacted by SUNBURST. We’re working with those vendors to update their security definitions to eliminate these
false positives.

QUESTION 12
Recent as of 4/5/2021
Some endpoint security tools flag old Orion installers left behind after upgrading to protected versions. Do these alerts mean that I
am still at risk?
Not necessarily. We do not have evidence to suggest that the mere presence of these old Orion installers puts you at risk.
If you’ve already upgraded to 2019.4.2, 2020.2.4, or 2020.2.5, the affected SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll was removed and
replaced from the runtime area, prohibiting it from executing further. However, depending on the path taken to upgrade, some old versions of
the .dll or MSIs were not fully removed.
To eliminate these alerts, we recommend that you remove those old installer files by following the steps outlined here.

QUESTION 13
Recent as of 4/6/2021
Has the Department of Homeland Security issued an Emergency Directive on this vulnerability?
Yes, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT), part of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), CERT issued Emergency Directive 21-01 on December 13, 2020 regarding this issue. CERT issued Alert (AA20352A), titled Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations, as
an update to ED 21-01 on December 17, 2020, based on our coordination with the agency. DHS released Supplemental Guidance to ED 21-01
on December 18, 2020, CERT revised its Alert AA20-352A on December 19, 2020, DHS released Supplemental Guidance v2 on December
30, 2020, and released Supplemental Guidance v3 on January 6, 2021 as part of our ongoing coordination with the agency. Additionally, CISA
released a malware analysis report of SUPERNOVA on January 27, 2021.
The latest information can be found on the CISA Supply Chain Compromise page at https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise.
The latest release, Orion Platform version 2020.2.5 is now available in the SolarWinds Customer Portal at customerportal.solarwinds.com, in
accordance with ED 21-01.

QUESTION 14
Recent as of 2/2/2021
Why does CISA recommend users split out the web server from the Orion Application server?

6/18

By splitting out the web server from the application server, you can leverage different controls to further secure your deployment. Orion
Platform users need access to the web server (port 443), which could have a large surface area, and the web server does not need to have
network access to the monitored devices – only the pollers (including the main poller) need network access. By deploying a separate web
server and shutting down and/or blocking access to the web console on the main poller, you can put a firebreak between the web interface
used by users and the monitored systems.
QUESTION 15
Recent as of 1/13/2021
What is SolarWinds doing to help find a solution?
Since the cyberattack on our customers and SolarWinds, we've worked around the clock to support our customers. As we shared in our recent
update, we're partnering with multiple industry-leading cybersecurity experts to strengthen our systems, further enhance our product
development processes, and adapt the ways that we deliver powerful, affordable, and secure solutions to our customers. Read more on the

*As a part of the ongoing investigation, we have determined that Orion Platform version 2019.4 unpatched, released in October 2019,
contained test modifications to the code base. While this version is not impacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability, it is the first version in which
we have seen activity from the attacker at this time. Subsequent releases 2019.4 HF 1, 2019.4 HF 2, 2019.4 HF 3, and 2019.4 HF 4 did not
include either test modifications contained in the 2019.4 version or the SUNBURST vulnerability contained in 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 with no
hotfix and 2020.2 HF 1.
** If you apply a SUPERNOVA security patch per the above chart, please visit this KB article to validate the patch was applied to all Orion
Platform web servers. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to reapply the respective patch.
*** If you use the SUPERNOVA Mitigation Script to address the Supernova vulnerability, use the guidance in the document within that package
to confirm the temporary patch. Please note that this script has only been tested down to NPM 11.x. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will
need to reapply this script.

QUESTION 19
Recent as of 1/13/2021
If your environment was compromised, why is it safe for us to install these updates/trust your code? OR What are you doing to
prevent future incidents moving forward?
Our investigations are ongoing, but since the vulnerabilities related to SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA were discovered, we have reviewed our
environment, giving an initial focus on ensuring the security of our build environment, including our source code repositories. We have
reviewed the architecture of the build environment, the privileged and non-privileged users that have access to the build environment, and the
network surrounding the build environment.
We have retained third-party cybersecurity experts to assist in an investigation of these matters, including whether the vulnerabilities were
exploited as a point of any infiltration of any customer systems, and in the development of appropriate mitigation and remediation plans to help
ensure future releases are protected. We are also cooperating and sharing information with our partners, vendors, and law enforcement,
intelligence, and government agencies around the world to assist in investigations and to avoid vulnerabilities in future releases.
Our investigations are ongoing, and we will continue to focus on ensuring that our environments are secure and protected. Read more about
our investigation here, and read more about the actions we're taking moving forward here.

Why can’t you tell us more about what’s going on?
While we understand there may a lot of questions on this situation, we will continue to communicate information as it’s available. Our
investigations into these matters are ongoing, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, intelligence and other government
agencies around the world to investigate them. We are also working with leading security experts in these investigations and to help further
secure our products and internal systems.

What about the vulnerabilities disclosed by Trustwave?
First, it’s important to note these vulnerabilities are not related to the SUNBURST attack, or to SUPERNOVA.
Vulnerabilities of varying degrees are common in all software products, including recent patches for Apple and Microsoft that solve critical
vulnerabilities, but we understand there is heightened scrutiny on SolarWinds right now. SolarWinds has always been committed to working
with our customers and other organizations to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities across our product portfolio in a responsible way.
Trustwave is a leading threat detection company that responsibly reports product vulnerabilities to companies as they are discovered prior to
broader announcement to allow companies to develop remediations to protect their customers.
The vulnerabilities announced by Trustwave concerning the Orion® Platform were addressed in Orion Platform version 2020.2.4, released
January 25, 2021. The vulnerabilities concerning Serv-U were addressed in Serv-U version 15.2.2 HF1, released January 22, 2021. To review
the list of currently supported versions of these products, please review the documentation.
Trustwave identified three vulnerabilities, two in the Orion Platform and one in our Serv-U file transfer product. To our knowledge, none of
these vulnerabilities have been exploited. The three vulnerabilities could be described as follows:
The first, which affects the Orion Platform, allows for an unprivileged user to extract passwords from the SQL Server database.
The second allows a remote user to execute a command against the Microsoft Message Queue service used by the Orion Platform.
The third allows an attacker to gain access to the Serv-U FTP server by creating an unauthorized user account.

QUESTION 23
Recent as of 2/5/2020
What about the issue disclosed by Sophos?
In the case of the Sophos announcement, it is important to note this is NOT a reported vulnerability in the Orion Platform product. This
situation was the result of a compromise within an individual company's network unrelated to SolarWinds. That breach enabled attackers to
add malicious code to the Orion Platform software instance within the customer's network.
In November of 2020, Sophos investigated an environment infected with a Ragnar Locker attack in which hundreds of computers were
compromised.
One of the computers compromised in the Ragnar Locker attack was a Windows server hosting the Orion product.
The threat actor had full administrative access to the Windows server and was able to copy and replace a signed .dll shipped with the
Orion Platform software with an unsigned, compromised version.
This compromised code was not shipped with the Orion Platform software.
Following the Orion Secure Configuration Guide mitigates the risk of this type of attack.

What is SUPERNOVA?

11/18

Shortly after SUNBURST was announced, third parties and the media publicly reported on a malware, now referred to as SUPERNOVA.
Based on our investigation, this malware could be deployed through an exploitation of a vulnerability in the Orion Platform. Like other software
companies, we seek to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in our products to our customers while also mitigating the risk that bad actors seek
to exploit those vulnerabilities by releasing updates to our products before we disclose the vulnerabilities.
CISA released a malware analysis report on SUPERNOVA on January 27, 2021. The SUPERNOVA malware consisted of two
components. The first was a malicious, unsigned webshell .dll “app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll” specifically written to be used
on the Orion Platform. The second is the exploitation of a vulnerability in the Orion Platform to enable deployment of the malicious code. The
latest updates were designed to remediate this vulnerability in all supported versions of the Orion Platform.
We constantly work to enhance the security of our products and to protect our customers and ourselves because hackers and other
cybercriminals are always seeking new ways to find and attack their victims. We work closely with our customers to address and remediate
any potential concerns, and we encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to
the get the full benefit of our updates, improvements, and enhancements.
QUESTION 25
Recent as of 12/26/2020
Is SUPERNOVA another supply chain attack?
Based on our investigation to date, SUPERNOVA is not malicious code embedded within the builds of our Orion® Platform as a supply chain
attack. It is malware that is separately placed on a server that requires unauthorized access to a customer’s network and is designed to appear
to be part of a SolarWinds product.
QUESTION 26
Recent as of 12/29/2020
What indicators of compromise (IOCs) of the SUPERNOVA malware have you identified?
Through our investigations, our retention of a third-party cybersecurity firm, and in cooperation with the law enforcement, intelligence and other
government agencies around the world in investigations related to the SUPERNOVA vulnerability, we’ve identified the following IOC:
The SUPERNOVA malware [app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll] with the file hash:
sha256 of the file app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll is:
c15abaf51e78ca56c0376522d699c978217bf041a3bd3c71d09193efa5717c71
QUESTION 27
Recent as of 12/31/2020
How can I confirm if I’ve applied either the SUPERNOVA mitigation script or one of the SUPERNOVA security fixes to my Orion
server(s)?
If you’re running Orion Platform version 2018.2, 2018.4, or 2019.2, you can run the script available here to verify one of the SUPERNOVA
Security Fixes (2018.2 HF6 Security Fix, 2018.4 HF3 Security Fix, 2019.2 HF3 Security Fix) for the recent SUPERNOVA security
vulnerability has been applied to your main Orion server and any additional web servers. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to
reapply the respective patch.
If you used the SUPERNOVA Mitigation Script to address the Supernova vulnerability, use the guidance in the document within that package to
confirm the temporary patch. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to reapply this script.

QUESTION 28
Recent as of 12/18/2020
What is SUNBURST?
SolarWinds was the victim of a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability (SUNBURST) within our Orion® Platform software builds for versions
2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched, and 2020.2 HF 1, which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the
server on which the Orion Platform products run. SUNBURST was very sophisticated supply chain attack, which refers to a disruption in a
standard process resulting in a compromised result with a goal of being able to attack subsequent users of the software.
Based on our investigation, it appears that the code was intended to be used in a targeted way as its exploitation requires manual intervention.
We’ve been advised that the sophistication and nature of SUNBURST indicates that it may have been conducted by an outside nation state,
but SolarWinds has not verified the identity of the attacker.
QUESTION 29

12/18

Recent as of 12/18/2020
How extensive is the impact of SUNBURST?
Based on our investigations to date, which are ongoing, we believe that the SUNBURST vulnerability was inserted within the Orion Platform
products and existed in updates released between March and June 2020 (which we call the “relevant period”) as a result of a compromise of
the Orion software build system and was not present in the source code repository of the Orion Platform products. SolarWinds has taken steps
to remediate the compromise of the Orion software build system and we’re investigating what additional steps, if any, should be taken. Also,
while we are still investigating our non-Orion products, we have not seen any evidence that they are impacted by SUNBURST. Based
on our investigations to date, SolarWinds currently believes that:
Orion Platform products downloaded, implemented or updated during the relevant period contained the SUNBURST vulnerability;
Orion Platform products downloaded and implemented before the relevant period and not updated during the relevant period did not
contain the SUNBURST vulnerability;
Orion Platform products downloaded and implemented after the relevant period did not contain the SUNBURST vulnerability; and
Previously affected versions of the Orion Platform products that were updated with a build released after the relevant period no longer
contained the SUNBURST vulnerability; however, the server on which the affected Orion Platform products ran may have been
compromised during the period in which the SUNBURST vulnerability existed.

QUESTION 30
Recent as of 4/6/2021
What should I do if I believe my environment has been compromised by the SUNBURST vulnerability?
If you believe your environment has been compromised by the SUNBURST vulnerability, below are the recommended steps to take:
First, determine the version of the Orion® Platform products you have installed here, and verify which hotfix updates you have installed here.
If you have already upgraded to 2020.2.5, additional security fixes and protections unrelated to SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA are
included in this version. For more information, review the Release Notes here, and KB article here.

If you have upgraded to 2020.2.4 or 2019.4 HF 2, both the SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA vulnerabilities have been addressed in these
versions—and they have also been digitally re-signed by newly obtained digital code-signing certificates.

If you have not already upgraded to 2020.2.5, 2020.2.4, or 2019.4.2, follow the guidance identified for your current version of your Orion
Platform products below to help ensure the security of your environment:
If you’re currently running Orion Platform version 2019.4 HF 4, we recommend you upgrade to 2020.2.5, or 2019.4.2 if you are unable to
upgrade to the latest version at this time.
If you’re currently running Orion Platform version 2019.4 HF 5, we recommend you rebuild your Orion server/VM for all pollers and install
Orion Platform version 2020.2.5 or 2019.4.2 if you are unable to upgrade to the latest version at this time.
If you’re currently running Orion Platform version 2020.2.1, but have run any of the previous infected versions, rebuild your Orion
server and/or VM for all pollers and install Orion Platform version 2020.2.5 on a fresh machine.
If you are running a version prior to Orion Platform version 2019.4 HF 4, we do not believe that your system was compromised with this
vulnerability. We still recommend as a best practice that you upgrade to the latest version, Orion Platform version 2020.2.5, to take
advantage of the latest security improvements.
To help protect your system, you should also block DNS access to any of the following:
avsvmcloud[.]com
panhardware[.]com
databasegalore[.]com
freescanonline[.]com
thedoccloud[.]com
deftsecurity[.]com

If you have the expertise to take the additional following action items, please do so:
Forensically image system memory and/or host operating systems hosting all instances of SolarWinds Orion Platform [versions 2019.4
HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched, and 2020.2 HF 1].
Analyze stored network traffic for indications of compromise, including new external DNS domains.
Consult with any security vendors with whom you currently have a relationship on their recommendations.

QUESTION 31
Recent as of 4/6/2021
If my Orion server currently or previously had a SUNBURST vulnerable version, should I simply upgrade or should I rebuild my
Orion server? What about my database?
We encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to the get the full benefit of
our updates, improvements and enhancements.
If you never ran a known, affected version on your Orion server, we do not recommend that you rebuild. We still recommend as a
best practice that you upgrade to the latest version, Orion Platform version 2020.2.5,to take advantage of the latest security
improvements.
If you ran a known, affected version of your Orion server and it had access to the internet, we recommend that you rebuild the server.
If your Orion server had no access to the internet, we do not recommend that you rebuild. An upgrade to Orion Platform version
2020.2.5 will be sufficient.
If you rebuild your servers, here are the factors to consider in deciding whether to retain your Orion Database:
Reference the CISA Alert (AA20-352A):
If you fall into Category 2, you should be able to re-install the software and retain your Orion databases for the platform, for flow,
and for logs—consistent with a thorough risk evaluation.
If you fall into Category 3, your Orion installation—including the Orion databases—are equally as vulnerable as the rest of the
environment, and you should follow your incident response procedures.

Additional considerations:
We are not aware of any indications at this time that the SUNBURST vulnerability routinely altered the Orion databases in any way.
You may want to audit configurations stored in the database, like alert actions, or executable scripts to confirm they have not been
tampered with.
If you chose to rebuild your databases, follow your incident response procedures to image and retain your databases, particularly
your flow database for forensic analysis.

QUESTION 32
Recent as of 12/16/2020
I want to manually check my version of the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll for the SUNBURST vulnerability. Do you know
a way to do that?
You should check your Orion server, any additional polling engine, high availability (HA) engines, and additional web servers. You can use the
following file hash information to check whether you have the version with the inserted vulnerability:
From Windows, open PowerShell and run the following (adjusting the file path if a different installation path was used):
Get-FileHash "C:\Program Files (x86)\SolarWinds\Orion\SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll"
Versions not known to contain the SUNBURST vulnerability:

QUESTION 34
Recent as of 12/20/2020
How do I know someone didn't exploit the SUNBURST vulnerability and move horizontally in my environment and compromise
another system?
If the SUNBURST vulnerability was exploited in your environment, you may see network traffic from the Orion server to the internet. This traffic
would be directed to a domain other than SolarWinds domain. Horizontal or lateral movement by an attacker would indicate that they have
gained privileged level access to your environment. Increased security event monitoring, close inspection of server and application access
logs, and understanding what local accounts exist on your corporate systems will help to identify any signs of misuse.
For further details, please see CERT Alert (AA20-352A), Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical
Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations, updated December 19, 2020: https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a.

QUESTION 37
Recent as of 12/15/2020
Why didn’t SolarWinds catch the SUNBURST vulnerability before it happened?
This SUNBURST vulnerability was very complex and sophisticated. It was crafted to evade detection and only run when detection was unlikely.
QUESTION 38
Recent as of 12/15/2020
With these processes in place how was your code compromised to insert the SUNBURST vulnerability?
We are not aware that the SolarWinds code base was compromised. Our initial investigations point to an issue in the Orion software build
system in which the SUNBURST vulnerability was inserted which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise
the server on which the Orion Platform products run.
