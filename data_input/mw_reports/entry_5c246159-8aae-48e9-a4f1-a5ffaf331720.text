How the Russia-Ukraine conflict is impacting cybercrime

Financially-motivated actors have been quiet, but that could change as the conflict escalates.

Intel 471 has been monitoring how the ongoing tension between Russia and Ukraine is
impacting the cybercrime underground. While financially-motivated actors have yet to show
their inclination to leverage the conflict for personal gain, the recent change of course from
Russian law enforcement in the form of arrests and takedowns show that the country will
leverage the underground for diplomatic advantage in the same way it does for its
intelligence purposes.
While there have been cyberattacks on Ukrainian entities over the past month, Intel 471 has
not observed any evidence that these attacks have been carried out by financially-motivated
actors. An attack carried out in January, in which Ukrainian websites were defaced as a cover
to launch destructive malware known as WhisperGate, has not attracted much attention from
underground actors. Of the discussions we observed, a low volume of actors elaborated on
how the attacks were committed and spoke on what they believed to be weaknesses in
Ukrainian critical infrastructure. The lack of discussion fits the methodology of financiallymotivated actors: attacks like WhisperGate are difficult to monetize. Additionally, a good
portion of these forums are pro-Russian in nature, with forum moderators frequently
discouraging or outright banning discussion threads that discuss politics.
Aside from the attack mentioned above, we also observed a small concentration of
advertisements and offers related to data tied to Ukrainian government organizations. While
the timing of the offers might suggest the actors used the current Russia-Ukraine tensions as
a motivator, or perhaps nation-state affiliated actors were at the helm in some way, we assess
these reasons were likely not the case. This assessment comes as the volume of Ukrainian
government data mirrors other instances we’ve observed over the past five years, when
geopolitical tensions were calm.
Conversely, there has been a lot of action in the form of Russian law enforcement arresting
various alleged cybercriminals over the past three months. Most recently, three underground
stores trading in compromised payment card data – Ferum shop, Trump Dumps and UAS
Shop – along with the Sky Fraud forum went offline, with a note indicating they allegedly
were seized by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). Later the same day, the Russian
TASS press agency reported six individuals were arrested in Russia on cybercrime charges.

While it’s unclear how everyone arrested is tied to the affected forums, one of those men —
Andrey Novak — has been linked to UNICC, another carding forum that “closed” last month.
Novak was also among those charged in absentia in 2018 by the U.S. Department of Justice
for allegedly working with notorious malware and carding forum Infraud.
These arrests, combined with the actions taken against the REvil ransomware gang, are an
unprecedented development in how Russian law enforcement deals with cybercriminals
within its own borders. For decades, Russia has been extremely lenient with cybercriminals
that have shown ties to Russia and a modus operandi of targeting countries that don’t belong
to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an intergovernmental organization which
includes Russia and former Soviet states. Cybercriminals have long developed their
techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) in order to purposely avoid targeting CIS
countries and businesses that operate within them, while forum admins and other organized
groups have banned any activity aimed at these countries.
It is possible that the Russian administration has authorized these law enforcement actions
as a diplomatic gesture to Western governments, given that Russia’s domestic security
agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), has publicly said some of the arrests were
conducted in conjunction with U.S. law enforcement. Russia’s desire to publicize these
actions through domestic and international mainstream outlets and social media platforms
suggests the administration is pushing a message of cooperation and resolution. Should
tensions cool between Ukraine and Russia, we assess it is possible that Russian law
enforcement will return to status quo leniency for these cybercriminals. Until then, Russianbased threat actors could see their country’s law enforcement’s recent actions as a deterrent
to conducting cybercrime activities, which would prove a worthy cause benefiting
organizations around the world.
It’s also likely that as the situation progresses, advantageous financially-motivated threat
actors may seek to target entities in Ukraine that may be more vulnerable due to understaffed
organizations or overburdened network infrastructure. Criminal actors may seek to purchase
access credentials, personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property to
capitalize on the distractions, and financially motivated actors could act as suppliers to fill
that gap.
Intel 471 will continue to monitor, analyze and report on the underground response as the
Russia-Ukraine conflict develops.
