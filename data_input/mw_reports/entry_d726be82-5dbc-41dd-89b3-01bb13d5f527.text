Executive Summary
Mandiant was engaged by Accellion, Inc. (Accellion) to perform a security assessment of Accellion's File Transfer
Appliance (FTA) software, in the wake of two related but distinct exploits used to attack client Accellion FTA
systems—one that was discovered and addressed by Accellion in December 2020 (the “December Exploit”), and
another that was discovered and addressed by Accellion in January 2021 (the “January Exploit”) (collectively, the
“Exploits”).
The objectives of Mandiant’s security assessment included:


Independently identifying the security vulnerabilities used in the attack activity, based on review of
compromised Accellion FTA instances



Validating the patches that Accellion issued for the vulnerabilities



Testing FTA version 9.12.432 (current as of the time of Mandiant testing) for further vulnerabilities in the
software

This assessment was performed between February 4, 2021 and February 26, 2021.

Summary of Results
Accellion identified two zero-day vulnerabilities that were part of the December Exploit—CVE-2021-27101 and
CVE-2021-27104—and two zero-day vulnerabilities that were part of the January Exploit—CVE-2021-27102 and
CVE-2021-27103. Based on Mandiant’s own forensic analysis of a sample of compromised Accellion FTA
instances—which were provided to Mandiant by Accellion as well as impacted Accellion customers (in
investigations Mandiant conducted directly for those customers), Mandiant confirmed that the attacker activity
exploited these vulnerabilities (the “Exploited Vulnerabilities”). Mandiant did not identify any additional
vulnerabilities that were exploited by the attackers.1 Mandiant also validated the efficacy of the patches Accellion
released to address the Exploited Vulnerabilities, which Accellion made available to FTA customers soon after
each Exploit was identified.
The Exploited Vulnerabilities were of critical severity because they were subject to exploitation via
unauthenticated remote code execution. Through its source code analysis and penetration testing, Mandiant did
not identify any new such unauthenticated remote code-execution vulnerabilities. Mandiant did identify two
previously unknown authenticated-user vulnerabilities: (1) Argument Injection (CVE-2021-27730), accessible to
authenticated users with administrative privileges; and (2) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-27731),
accessible to regular authenticated users. The Argument Injection finding yielded a Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS v3.0) score of 6.6 (medium severity) and the Stored Cross-Site Scripting finding was rated 8.1
(high severity). Accellion has developed a patch for these two vulnerabilities (FTA 9.12.444), which Mandiant has
validated.

Project Scope
Accellion FTA Vulnerability Identification: Mandiant reviewed the source code for Accellion FTA versions 9.12.370
through 9.12.432, as well as a sample of ten (10) forensic images from affected Accellion FTA instances, in order
to identify the vulnerabilities involved in the attack activity and to test for additional vulnerabilities. This review
involved the following methods:

1

As explained in a separate blog post, Mandiant has attributed the attack activity on FTA systems to two
uncategorized threat groups—one that is believed to be responsible for compromising the systems (UNC2546),
and another that is believed to be responsible for engaging in extortion activity with respect to a subset of the
compromised customers (UNC2582).

3

1. Source code analysis
2. Dynamic penetration testing of Accellion FTA
3. Forensic analysis of compromised Accellion FTA appliances
Accellion FTA Patch Validation: Mandiant reviewed the Accellion FTA product version 9.12.432 (current as of the
time of Mandiant’s review) to validate that the version mitigated the Exploited Vulnerabilities. Mandiant then
attempted variations of exploits to determine if the 9.12.432 version of Accellion FTA could be exploited using
variations of the known attack vectors. The following areas were reviewed during this portion of the assessment:
1. Attempting alternative variations of the previously identified exploits
2. Attempting to exploit web pages and web services application programming interfaces (SOAP APIs)
not used by attackers

Forensic Analysis
Materials Reviewed
In analyzing the Exploited Vulnerabilities previously identified by Accellion – SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101),
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2021-27103), and OS Command Execution (CVE-2021-27102, CVE2021-27104) – Mandiant had access to and reviewed forensic images from ten (10) affected Accellion FTA
instances. The majority of the instances reflected activity associated with the December Exploit, while the others
reflected activity associated with the January Exploit. Based on Mandiant’s experience, the activity observed on
these instances is likely to be representative of attacker activity on other affected instances not reviewed by
Mandiant, given the repetitive, script-like execution of the activity observed. In some cases, in addition to the FTA
instances themselves, Mandiant had access to firewall logs from the networks the FTA appliances were hosted
on, which allowed Mandiant to identify additional evidence of attacker activity based on known attacker IP
addresses.

How the Attack Operated
December Exploit
With respect to the December Exploit, Mandiant observed that the attacker chained together the following
vulnerabilities: SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101) and OS Command Execution (CVE-2021-27104). The attacker
leveraged the SQL Injection vulnerability against the file document_root.html to retrieve “W” keys from the
Accellion FTA database. These keys were then used to generate valid tokens that allowed the attacker to then
make additional requests to a file named sftp_account_edit.php. While abusing the OS Command Execution
vulnerability in this file, the attackers were able to execute their own commands, resulting in the creation of a web
shell2 written to /home/seos/courier/oauth.api.
The attacker likely used the newly created oauth.api web shell to upload a custom, more full-fledged web shell
with the filename of about.html (variant 1) to disk, which included highly customized tooling designed to facilitate
exfiltration of data from the FTA system. While the timing of the requests resulting in the generation of this second
web shell suggests that it was delivered via the oauth.api web shell, the available evidence does not indicate
the exact mechanism used to write it to disk. For threat-tracking purposes, Mandiant has labeled this second web
shell as “DEWMODE”.
The DEWMODE web shell extracts a list of available files from a MySQL database on the targeted Accellion FTA
system and lists those files and corresponding metadata (file ID, path, filename, uploader, and recipient) on an
HTML page. File download requests are captured in the web logs for the Accellion FTA system, which will contain
requests to the DEWMODE web shell with encrypted and encoded URL parameters, where dwn is the file path
and fn is the requested file name. The DEWMODE webshell has features that allow the attacker to delete the
Accellion FTA web logs. Forensic analysts may need to recover these logs from slack space for analysis.
The uploading of the DEWMODE web shell to the file location where the attacker placed it had the effect (likely
unanticipated by and unknown to the attacker) of tripping the built-in anomaly detector included in the FTA
software. Once the anomaly detector is tripped, it generates an email alert to the customer (specifically to the
admin email account designated by the customer), advising the customer to contact Accellion for support. As a
result, any FTA customer affected by the December Exploit likely was sent such an email – which, per Accellion,
is how the December Exploit came to its attention (see above Timeline).

2 A web shell is a script that can be uploaded to a web server to enable remote execution of commands.

January Exploit
Mandiant observed that, after the December 20, 2020 release of patch 9.12.380, which remediated the
vulnerabilities associated with the December Exploit, the attacker pivoted to a new technique involving ServerSide Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2021-27103) and OS Command Execution (CVE-2021-27102).
The attacker chained together an SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2021-27103) with a Command Execution vulnerability
(CVE-2021-27102) to execute commands on the system. Specifically, the attacker leveraged the SSRF
vulnerability against the file wmProgressstat.html to reach a local SOAP web service located in the file
sw_update.php, which would not otherwise be accessible from the Internet. Once access was established with
the file sw_update.php, the attacker abused the OS Command Execution vulnerability in this file to create other
malicious files, including another about.html (variant 2) DEWMODE web shell used to further the remainder of
their attack.
Notably, in the case of this second exploit, the attacker uploaded the DEWMODE web shell to a different location
(/home/httpd/html/about.html), likely to avoid FTA’s built-in anomaly detector. The earliest evidence we
have seen of this change in tactic appears on January 20, 2020.
Both Exploits
Both the December Exploit and the January Exploit demonstrate a high level of sophistication and deep familiarity
with the inner workings of the Accellion FTA software, likely obtained through extensive reverse engineering of
the software. Among the things the attacker had to know were:






How to call internal APIs to obtain keys to decrypt filenames
How to forge tokens for internal API calls
How to chain together the vulnerabilities involved to conduct unauthenticated remote code execution
How to navigate FTA’s internal database, requiring a detailed understanding of the database structure
How to bypass FTA’s built-in anomaly detector (in the case of the January Exploit)

Indicators of Compromise
Based on Mandiant’s review of the logs and images available for analysis, the attacker activity generated the
following signatures for each affected customer, all of which should be considered as signs of potential
compromise:
December Exploit
The December Exploit, which leveraged SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101) and OS Command Execution (CVE2021-27104), yielded Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) of the following files with their respective directories:








/home/seos/courier/about.html (DEWMODE)
/home/seos/courier/httpd.pid
/home/seos/courier/oauth.api
/home/seos/courier/DF
/tmp/.out
/tmp/.scr
/home/seos/courier/cache.jz.gz

As noted above, the attacker activity tripped FTA’s anomaly detector, causing an alert to be sent to the
administrator of the affected customer’s application.
During the cleanup routine, the attacker passed a specific query parameter named csrftoken with the
value 11454bd782bb41db213d415e10a0fb3c to DEWMODE. This would cause the following actions:


A shell script is written to /tmp/.scr, which will:

7



Remove all references to about.html from log files located in /var/opt/apache/



Write the modified log file to /tmp/x then attempt to replace the original log file
at /var/opt/apache/



Delete the contents of the /home/seos/log/adminpl.log log file



Remove /home/seos/courier/about.html (DEWMODE)
and /home/seos/courier/oauth.api (eval web shell), and redirect command output to the
file /tmp/.out



Change the permissions of the output file to be readable, writeable and executable by all users,
and set the owner to “nobody”



Delete the script file /tmp/.scr and other temporarily created files to assist in cleanup



Display cleanup output to the requesting user

January Exploit
The January Exploit, which leveraged Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2021-27102) and OS
Command Execution (CVE-2021-27103), yielded IOCs of the following files with their respective directories:








/home/httpd/html/about.html (DEWMODE)
/home/httpd/html/httpd.pid
/home/httpd/html/oauth.api
/home/httpd/html/DF
/tmp/.out
/tmp/.scr
/home/httpd/html/cache.jz.gz

The variant instance of DEWMODE used in the January Exploit (bdfd11b1b092b7c61ce5f02ffc5ad55a) had a
slightly modified cleanup routine, which included wiping of /var/log/secure and
removing about.html and oauth.api from the directories /home/httpd/html/ instead
of /home/seos/courier/.
During the cleanup routine, the attacker removed all references of the about.html webshell from systems’
/var/opt/apache log files, cleared the /home/seos/log/adminpl.log file, removed files from the
/home/httpd/html directory, and cleared the /var/log/secure log file. This variant of about.html and the
anti-forensic script appear to be an improvement of the earlier variant of about.html, which failed to clear the
/var/log/secure log file where previous versions of the anti-forensic script were recorded. Mandiant did identify
evidence of the anti-forensic script execution within rolled versions of the /var/log/secure log file.

Validation of Accellion’s Remediation of the Exploited Vulnerabilities
As reflected in the Timeline section, Accellion issued a patch addressing the vulnerabilities associated with the
December Exploit on December 20, 2020 (four days after it started investigating anomalous activity associated
with the exploit), and a patch addressing the vulnerabilities associated with the January Exploit on January 25,
2021 (three days after it started investigating anomalous activity associated with the exploit, having advised all
FTA customers to shut down their FTA instances in the interim).
Accellion asked Mandiant to confirm that the patches successfully closed these Exploited Vulnerabilities, and that
no other vulnerabilities were exploited as part of the attack activity. Mandiant’s analysis confirmed both points.
Mandiant performed patch validation of Accellion FTA 9.12.432 (which includes the December 20 and January 22
patches) to validate that the latest version of Accellion FTA mitigates each of the four Exploited Vulnerabilities. As

8

part of this review, Mandiant reviewed the source code in both versions 9.12.370 (pre-dating both the December
20 and January 22 patches) and 9.12.432 to confirm that the changes completely mitigated the Exploited
Vulnerabilities.
Mandiant also tested variations of the exploit techniques involved in the Exploits to ensure that Accellion’s
implementation of input validation and sanitization could not be bypassed. This component of the assessment
included attempting alternative variations of the Exploits, as well as attempting to exploit web pages and SOAP
APIs not initially used by attackers.
Based on these analyses, Mandiant confirmed that the patches issued by Accellion fully resolved the Exploited
Vulnerabilities, as shown in the table below.

Mandiant also confirmed through forensic analysis of compromised Accellion FTA instances that the only
vulnerabilities exploited in the attacker activity on the devices were the Exploited Vulnerabilities. Mandiant did not
identify additional vulnerabilities that were part of the attacker activity.

Testing FTA for Additional Vulnerabilities
Objectives and Methodology
Accellion also asked Mandiant to review the Accellion FTA software for any other vulnerabilities Mandiant was
able to find, beyond the Exploited Vulnerabilities. Specifically, Mandiant reviewed the versions of the software
dating from December 16, 2020 to the time of Mandiant’s review, including:






9.12.370
9.12.380
9.12.411
9.12.416
9.12.432

Mandiant’s review relied on both source code analysis and dynamic penetration testing:


Source code analysis: Mandiant was provided a copy of unobfuscated source code by Accellion.
Mandiant was also provided a list of unauthenticated endpoints provided by Accellion to prioritize.
Mandiant reviewed the source code using manual techniques and did not rely on automated source code
review tools.

3 An API endpoint can be a URL of a webpage or web service.

9



Dynamic penetration testing: The focus of the dynamic penetration testing phase of the assessment was
to identify vulnerabilities by directly interacting with the Accellion FTA software. To facilitate this testing,
Mandiant primarily used Burp Suite Professional (“Burp Suite”), a multifunction web proxy. Mandiant
began the assessment by prioritizing analysis of endpoints that did not require authentication.

Mandiant began to review the files corresponding to endpoints, looking for insecure usage of functions that accept
input from an untrusted source. This methodology is referred to as “taint analysis,” as it involves identifying
potentially insecure functions where an untrusted user input is being supplied. Mandiant analyzed each result
from such inputs to determine if any vulnerabilities were surfaced. As a result of this analysis, Mandiant identified
a Stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-27731) resulting from lack of input validation or sanitization.
Mandiant continued this analysis by manually searching for sensitive or insecure PHP built-in functions that
accepted untrusted input. Mandiant searched for insecure functions by referencing various documentation on the
Internet detailing functions which have been historically exploited. In addition, Mandiant searched for additional
instances of the functions exploited as part of the Exploited Vulnerabilities, to ensure untrusted inputs were not
being provided to these functions. As a result of Mandiant’s analysis of application endpoints accessible only to
an administrator, Mandiant observed application endpoints calling a local Perl script named admin.pl.
Specifically, Mandiant searched for usage of the insecure PHP functions escapeshellargs and
escapeshellcmd used in conjunction with this function. After triaging the output, Mandiant identified a single API
endpoint that did not properly sanitize user input, allowing Mandiant to inject an argument when calling the
admin.pl script (CVE2021-27730).
Mandiant then proceeded to review the source code of each file corresponding to application API endpoints. This
was necessary as the majority of these application endpoints were not accessible from the application user
interface. In instances where functionality potentially of use to an attacker was identified, Mandiant attempted to
craft requests and manipulate inputs to probe for vulnerabilities and observe the application’s behavior.
Specifically, Mandiant searched for functionality potentially susceptible to injection-based issues allowing for
remote code execution or unauthorized access to data stored within the SQL database or on the remote file
system. Mandiant did not identify any vulnerabilities as a result of this analysis.
Mandiant also carefully evaluated the Accellion FTA software’s authentication logic to ensure it was not
vulnerable to an authentication bypass issue, which might allow an attacker to access an authenticated endpoint
without being validly authenticated. In addition to searching for injection-based issues, Mandiant searched for
issues which could allow for users to bypass authentication or authorization controls. For example, Mandiant
attempted to tamper with inputs containing session information such as cookies or tokens, to see if the requested
application endpoint or file could still be accessed. Mandiant did not identify any vulnerability through this
analysis.
Results of Testing FTA for Additional Vulnerabilities
The Exploited Vulnerabilities were of critical severity because they allowed for remote code execution by an
unauthenticated user. Mandiant’s source code analysis and penetration testing did not identify any new
unauthenticated remote code-execution vulnerabilities beyond the Exploited Vulnerabilities.
Mandiant identified two new findings for authenticated users, consisting of Argument Injection (CVE-2021-27730),
which was accessible only to authenticated users with administrative privileges, and a Stored Cross-Site Scripting
(CVE-2021-27731), which was accessible only to regular authenticated users. The Argument Injection finding
yielded a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.6 (medium severity) and the Stored Cross-Site Scripting finding was rated 8.1
(high severity).
After being alerted to Mandiant’s findings, Accellion developed FTA patch 9.12.444 to address these newly
identified findings. Mandiant validated that the patch effectively remediated these vulnerabilities, specifically
attempting to exploit FTA version 9.12.444 and confirming that injected input was correctly sanitized.
