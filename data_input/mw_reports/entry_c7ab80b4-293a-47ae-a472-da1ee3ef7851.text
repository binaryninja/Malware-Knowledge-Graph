Seven years ago, in 2009, we saw a completely new type of attack on banks. Instead of
infecting the computers of thousands of users worldwide, criminals went directly after the
ATM itself – infecting it with malware called Skimer. Seven years later, our Global Research
and Analysis Team together with Penetration Testing Team have been called on for an
incident response. They discovered a new, improved, version of Skimer.

Virus style infections
Criminals often obscured their malware with packers to make analysis more difficult for
researchers. The criminals behind Skimer also did this, using the commercially available
packer Themida, which packs both the infector and the dropper.
Once the malware is executed it checks if the file system is FAT32. If it is, it drops the file
netmgr.dll in the folder C:\Windows\System32. If it is an NTFS file system, the same file will
be placed in the NTFS data stream corresponding to the XFS service´s executable file.
Placing the file in an NTFS data stream is most likely done to make forensic analysis more
difficult.
After successful installation, the sample patches the XFS executable (SpiService.exe) entry
point, in order to add a LoadLibrary call to the dropped netmgr.dll file. This file is also
protected by Themida.

Entry point in SpiService.exe before infection

Entry point in SpiService.exe after infection
After a successful installation the ATM is rebooted. The malicious library will be loaded into
the SpiService.exe thanks to the new LoadLibrary call, providing it with full access to XFS.

Functionality
Unlike Tyupkin, where there was a magic code and a specific time frame where the malware
was active, Skimer only wakes up when a magic card (specific Track 2 data, see IOCs at the
bottom of this blogpost) is inserted. It is a smart way to implement access control to the
malware’s functionality.
Once the magic card is inserted, the malware is ready to interact with two different types of
cards, each with different functions:
1. Card type 1 – request commands through the interface
2. Card type 2 – execute the command hardcoded in the Track2
After the card is ejected, the user will be presented with a form, asking them to insert the
session key in less than 60 seconds. Now the user is authenticated, and the malware will
accept 21 different codes for setting its activity. These codes should be entered from the pin
pad.
Below is a list of the most important features:
1. Show installation details;
2. Dispense money – 40 notes from the specified cassette;
3. Start collecting the details of inserted cards;
4. Print collected card details;
5. Self delete;
6. Debug mode;
7. Update (the updated malware code is embedded on the card).
During its activity, the malware also creates the following files or NTFS streams (depending
on the file system type). These files are used by the malware at different stages of its activity,
such as storing the configuration, storing skimmed card data and logging its activity:
C:\Windows\Temp\attrib1

card data collected from network traffic or from the card reader;

C:\Windows\Temp\attrib4

logs data from different APIs responsible for the
communication with the keyboard (effectively logging data such
as the pin);

C:\Windows\Temp\mk32
C:\Windows\Temp:attrib1

same as the homologue file;

C:\Windows\Temp:attrib4

same as the homologue file;

C:\Windows\Temp:mk32

same as the homologue file;

C:\Windows\Temp:opt

logs mule´s activity.

Conclusions
During our recent Incident Response cases related to the abuse of ATMs, we have identified
Tyupkin, Carbanak and black box attacks. The evolution of Backdoor.Win32.Skimer
demonstrates the attacker interest in these malware families as ATMs are a very convenient
cash-out mechanism for criminals.
One important detail to note about this case is the hardcoded information in the Track2 – the
malware waits for this to be inserted into the ATM in order to activate. Banks may be able to
proactively look for these card numbers inside their processing systems, and detect
potentially infected ATMs, money mules, or block attempts to activate the malware.
We also recommend regular AV scans, the use of allowlisting technologies, a good device
management policy, full disk encryption, the protection of ATM BIOS with a password, only
allowing HDD booting, and isolating the ATM network from any other internal bank networks.
Kaspersky Lab has now identified 49 modifications of this malware, with 37 of these
modifications targeting ATMs made by just one manufacturer. The most recent version was
discovered at the beginning of May 2016.
All samples described are detected by Kaspersky Lab as Backdoor.Win32.Skimer. Patched
SpiService.exe files are detected as Trojan.Win32.Patched.rb

As this is still an ongoing investigation, we have already shared the full report with different
LEAs, CERTs, financial institutions and Kaspersky Lab Threat Intelligence-Service
customers. For more information please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com
