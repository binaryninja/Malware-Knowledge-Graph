Executive Summary
BazarLoader is Windows-based malware spread through various methods involving email.
These infections provide backdoor access that criminals use to determine whether the host
is part of an Active Directory (AD) environment. If so, criminals deploy Cobalt Strike and
perform reconnaissance to map the network. If the results indicate a high-value target,
criminals attempt lateral movement and will often deploy ransomware like Conti or Ryuk.
This blog reviews a recent BazarLoader infection, how it led to Cobalt Strike, and how Cobalt
Strike led to network reconnaissance. If you discover similar activity within your network, you
could be a target for ransomware.

Organizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration and up-to-date
Windows hosts have a much lower risk of infection. Palo Alto Networks customers are further
protected from this threat. Our Threat Prevention security subscription for the NextGeneration Firewall detects the BazarLoader sample from this infection and similar samples.
Endpoint detection like Cortex XDR can prevent Cobalt Strike activity and criminal access to
your network.

Distribution Methods for BazarLoader
During summer 2021, different campaigns distributed BazarLoader malware using emails.
From late July through mid-August 2021, the majority of BazarLoader samples were spread
through three campaigns.
The BazarCall campaign pushed BazarLoader using emails for initial contact and call centers
to guide potential victims to infect their computers. By early July, a copyright violation-themed
campaign using ZIP archives named Stolen Images Evidence.zip also began pushing
BazarLoader. By late July, a long-running campaign known as TA551 (Shathak) started
pushing BazarLoader through English-language emails.
In addition to those three major campaigns, we discovered at least one example of
BazarLoader distributed through an Excel spreadsheet of undetermined origin. Our case
study reviews an infection generated using this example on Aug. 19, 2021.

Malicious Excel Spreadsheet

2/11

The malicious Excel spreadsheet was discovered on Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2021, and it has
a last modified date of Tuesday, Aug. 17. The filename had an .xlsb file extension. This file
has macros designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host with BazarLoader. Figure 2 shows
a screenshot of the Excel file.
Though the DocuSign logo appears in Figure 2, this Excel template was created by a threat
actor trying to instill confidence by taking advantage of the DocuSign brand name and image.
Various threat actors use this and other DocuSign-themed images on a near-daily basis.
DocuSign is aware of this ongoing threat and provides guidelines on how to handle these
types of malicious files.

Figure 2. Screenshot of the malicious Excel spreadsheet.
After enabling malicious macros on a vulnerable Windows host, the spreadsheet presented a
new tab for a page with fake invoice information, as shown below in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Excel spreadsheet presented a fake invoice after enabling macros.
As it presented the fake invoice page, the spreadsheet’s macro code had already retrieved a
malicious binary for BazarLoader.

BazarLoader Binary
The spreadsheet’s macro code retrieved a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file for
BazarLoader from the following URL:
hxxps://pawevi[.]com/lch5.dll
As shown below in Figure 4, the DLL was saved to the victim’s home directory at C:\Users\
[username]\tru.dll. It ran using regsvr32.exe.

The BazarLoader DLL was immediately copied to another location and made persistent
through the Windows registry, as shown below in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Location and Windows registry update for persistent BazarLoader DLL.
As seen in Figure 5, the filename changed from tru.dll to kibuyuink.exe, even though it
remained a DLL and still required regsvr32.exe to run. Changing the filename extension is a
common tactic seen in various malware infections.

Bazar C2 Traffic
This example of BazarLoader generated command and control (C2) activity, retrieving
BazarBackdoor using HTTPS traffic from 104.248.174[.]225 over TCP port 443. Then
BazarBackdoor generated C2 activity using HTTPS traffic to 104.248.166[.]170 over TCP
port 443. In Figure 6, we refer to this combined C2 activity as Bazar C2 traffic.

Figure 6. Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark.
This example of Bazar C2 activity generates traffic to legitimate domains. This activity is not
inherently malicious on its own. Various malware families generate similar traffic as a
connectivity check or to ensure an infected Windows host has continued internet access.

Cobalt Strike Activity
Approximately 41 minutes after the initial BazarLoader infection, our infected Windows host
started generating Cobalt Strike activity using HTTPS traffic to gojihu[.]com and yuxicu[.]com,
as shown below in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Wireshark showing when the Cobalt Strike activity began.
In this case, a Cobalt Strike DLL file was sent through Bazar C2 traffic and saved to the
infected Windows host under the user’s AppData\Roaming directory. Figure 8 shows the
Cobalt Strike DLL running on the infected machine.

Cobalt Strike leads to reconnaissance of an infected host’s environment. In our lab
environments, this reconnaissance activity can start within a few minutes after Cobalt Strike
traffic first appears.

Reconnaissance Activity
In our case study, approximately two minutes after Cobalt Strike activity started, a tool to
enumerate an AD environment appeared on the infected host at
C:\ProgramData\AdFind.exe. This tool has been used by criminal groups to gather
information from an AD environment. AdFind is a command line tool, and an associated
batch file was used to run the tool in our case study.
Figure 9 shows the location of AdFind, the associated batch file adf.bat and the results of its
search saved in seven text files.

Figure 10 shows commands used in the adf.bat file that run AdFind.exe.

Figure 10. Commands used for AdFind.exe.

8/11

These commands reveal the users, computers, file shares and other information from a
targeted AD environment.
Our example did not involve a high-value target, and the environment was wiped within two
or three hours after the initial infection. In this example, no follow-up ransomware was sent
after the reconnaissance.

Conclusion
This case study reveals one example of an initial malware infection moving to Cobalt Strike,
followed by reconnaissance activity. When attackers use Cobalt Strike, they can also perform
other types of reconnaissance in an AD environment.
If the AD environment is a high-value target, the attacker’s next step is lateral movement and
gaining access to the domain controller and other servers within the network.
This is a common pattern seen before attackers hit an organization with ransomware.
Organizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration and up-to-date
Windows hosts have a much lower risk of infection. Palo Alto Networks customers are further
protected from this threat. Our Threat Prevention security subscription for the NextGeneration Firewall detects this and similar BazarLoader samples. Endpoint detection like
Cortex XDR can prevent Cobalt Strike activity and criminal access to your network.
