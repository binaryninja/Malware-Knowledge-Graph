New Redline Password Stealer Malware

March 16, 2020

In early March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed an email campaign attempting to deliver a previously
unknown malware which the malware author calls RedLine Stealer. This name (not to be confused with the
FireEye tool “Redline”) can be seen in the forum advertisements, code comments, and command and
control (C&C) panel.
The emails in this password stealer campaign abused the Folding@home brand, which is a distributed
computing project for disease research, while also asking the recipient to help find a coronavirus cure. This
campaign primarily targeted healthcare and manufacturing industries in the United States.

The RedLine password stealer virus is new malware available for sale on Russian underground forums with
several pricing options: $150 lite version; $200 pro version; $100 / month subscription option. It steals
information from browsers such as login, autocomplete, passwords, and credit cards. It also collects
information about the user and their system such as the username, their location, hardware configuration,
and installed security software. A recent update to RedLine Stealer also added the ability to steal
cryptocurrency cold wallets.
RedLine Stealer is written in C#. While not particularly sophisticated, we were surprised by the high quality
and readability of the code. Notably with its proper use of delegates, class inheritance, and data models
along with using SOAP for its C&C channel. This indicates a moderate-to-high level of experience with the
.NET programming language from the developer. RedLine Stealer also appears to be under active
development as shown by the recent introduction of new features.

Redline Password Stealer Malware Delivery Analysis
On March 7, 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed an email campaign consisting of thousands of
messages and attempting to deliver RedLine Stealer via a URL in the email messages. The campaign
targeted primarily the United States. Recipients were in many different industries but the top affected were
healthcare and manufacturing.
Emails were sent from “Shannon Wilson <shannon@litegait[.]com>” with the subject “Please help us with
Fighting corona-virus”. These emails purported to come from "Mobility Research Inc" and implored
recipients to help find a cure to coronavirus by participating in their program "Folding@Thome".
“Folding@Thome” (notice the extra “T”) is a spoof of a legitimate distributed computing project
Folding@home. In this project, similar to SETI@home, participants are asked to help by donating their
computing power through the use of an application that does processing on behalf of the organization.
According to Folding@home, participants are donating their computing power “for disease research that
simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics.”
Participants in the legitimate Folding@home project download the official application from their website. In
this malicious email campaign, recipients are encouraged to download the application via a link in the email.
After clicking the link, the user is redirected to the malware executable hosted on BitBucket. Figure 1 shows
a sample of the malicious email.

Because Folding@home participants need to install an application on their system to help the project, the
use of this as a lure is particularly clever by the attackers, as recipients who want to help with coronavirus
research may not find the downloading and installation of an application unusual or unexpected.

RedLine Stealer for Sale
We found “for sale” advertisements for RedLine Stealer on several forums (one as early as Feb 20, 2020).
Some appear to be from an official seller with several pricing options ($100 / month subscription; $150 lite
version; $200 pro version), while some appear to be a cracked version (selling for $300). The official
advertisement is as follows, translated from Russian:
*********************************************************

RunPE - injection of a 32-bit file downloaded from link into another file
DownloadAndEx - download a file from link to the specified path with subsequent launch
OpenLink - open a link in the default browser
*********************************************************
Also, on March 4, the seller advertised an update that added stealing of cryptocurrency cold wallets.
The C&C panel is a GUI program installed on a dedicated Windows server, not as a web panel. Specifically,
the panel operates as a WSDL application which responds to configured SOAP APIs to interact with the
client malware sample. The panel has typical functionality for controlling malware like this including
displaying, sorting, exporting, commenting, searching logs, creating downloads, running tasks. The panel
boasts having convenient features for log sellers such as exporting logs for a list of websites.
In Figure 2 you can see the Loader Tasks panel where actions such as “Download”, “RunPE”,
“DownloadAndEx”, “OpenLink” can be specified.

In Figure 3 you can see the Settings panel where options such as for log collection can be specified.

In Figure 4 you can see the logs panel where a summary of the stolen information is displayed.

Malware Analysis
Proofpoint researchers have confirmed all functionality described in the forum advertisements. RedLine is a
stealer that supports FTP (such as FileZilla, WinSCP), IM clients (such as Pidgin), crypto-currency wallets,
and browser cookies/settings. It also reports back a range of information about the system and can perform
additional tasks such as downloading and running payloads.
In addition to the features listed above, there were some additional points that we found interesting:
Panel is a WSDL service
Client configuration is supplied (and updatable) from C&C
C&C communications use SOAP over HTTP
Figure 5 through Figure 8 below show code samples from RedLine.

In Figure 9 you can see an example of the network traffic generated by the stealer. Specifically, in this traffic
the C&C configures the client settings (GrabBrowsers, GrabFTP, etc) via SOAP protocol (over HTTP).

Conclusion
RedLine Password Stealer virus, a new previously undocumented malware has appeared in a new email
campaign aimed at U.S. healthcare and manufacturing organizations. It already has many of the standard
information stealer features, as well as additional features such as downloading secondary payloads and

advanced filtering features. The developer appears to be actively working on and updating the malware.
This specific password stealer campaign used COVID-19 and Folding@home lures to make downloading
this application seem plausible. We are currently observing many other actors trying COVID-19 email lures
for a variety of nefarious purposes such as attempting to deliver malware, phishing, business email
compromise, and spam.
