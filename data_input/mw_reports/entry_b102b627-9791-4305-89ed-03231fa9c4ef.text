In June 2021, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts identified malware whose loader has some
similarities to the Manuscrypt malware, which is part of the Lazarus APT group’s arsenal. In
2020, the group used Manuscrypt in attacks on defense enterprises in different countries.
These attacks are described in the report “Lazarus targets defense industry with
ThreatNeedle“.
Curiously, the data exfiltration channel of the malware uses an implementation of the KCP
protocol that has previously been seen in the wild only as part of the APT41 group’s toolset.
We dubbed the newly-identified malware PseudoManuscrypt.
The PseudoManuscrypt loader makes its way onto user systems via a MaaS platform that
distributes malware in pirated software installer archives. One specific case of the
PseudoManuscrypt downloader’s distribution is its installation via the Glupteba botnet
(whose main installer is also distributed via the pirated software installer distribution
platform). This means that the malware distribution tactics used by the threat actor behind
PseudoManuscrypt demonstrate no particular targeting.

During the period from January 20 to November 10, 2021, Kaspersky products blocked
PseudoManuscrypt on more than 35,000 computers in 195 countries of the world. Such a
large number of attacked systems is not characteristic of the Lazarus group or APT attacks
as a whole.
Targets of PseudoManuscrypt attacks include a significant number of industrial and
government organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and
research laboratories.
According to our telemetry, at least 7.2% of all computers attacked by the PseudoManuscrypt
malware are part of industrial control systems (ICS) used by organizations in various
industries, including Engineering, Building Automation, Energy, Manufacturing, Construction,
Utilities, and Water Management.
The main PseudoManuscrypt module has extensive and varied spying functionality. It
includes stealing VPN connection data, logging keypresses, capturing screenshots and
videos of the screen, recording sound with the microphone, stealing clipboard data and
operating system event log data (which also makes stealing RDP authentication data
possible), and much more. Essentially, the functionality of PseudoManuscrypt provides the
attackers with virtually full control of the infected system.
More information on PseudoManuscrypt is available on the Kaspersky ICS CERT website.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware

7/9

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
