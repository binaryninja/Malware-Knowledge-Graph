What is?
Threat Intelligence

Unwrapping ‘Understand’
Challenge
New threats emerge, and it is challenging for most
organizations to proactively scan, assess and
understand the many issues and dynamic risks
that impact their business. It is also hard to
objectively identify own weaknesses, and thereby
define and operationalize own risk appetite.
Organizations needs to increase their situational
awareness – from yearly transitioning to daily

Why is it needed
•

▪
▪

Reduce time to detect and respond to cyber
incidents by massively expanding monitoring
coverage of IT infrastructure
Focus on endpoint monitoring and response to
increase radius of action
Fully adopt real-time analytics in monitoring
Obtain deeper visibility in partner compliance
(e.g. via monitoring)

What is Threat Intelligence?
Threat intelligence is actionable knowledge and
insight on adversaries and their malicious
activities enabling defenders and their
organizations to reduce risks through better
security decision-making.
(From Sergio Caltagirone)

• Who adversaries are
• What adversaries use
• Where adversaries target
• When adversaries act
• Why adversaries attack

• How adversaries operate

Threat intelligence is not a feed of observables
such as IP addresses, domains or hashes

What is?
Intelligence-driven incident response

Unwrapping ‘prepare’
Challenge
Many organizations fail to coordinate across silos
or link crisis management plans with overall
strategy and so their efforts are not cost-effective,
focused on the most critical scenarios or in line
with high level performance objectives.

What is needed?

Preparation and planning is key to managing a
crisis:
• Decide what is important
• Clearly define roles & responsibilities
• Plan for critical risk scenarios
• Ensure contingencies and sufficient resources
• Set up systems and partners
• Train and communicate plans

Preparation

Core components
• Wargaming
• Intelligence-led red/blue
teaming
• Crisis management strategy
• Stakeholder dialogue
• Business continuity

• Communication plans
• Issue management
• Executive and spokesperson

What is?
Intelligence-driven incident response

Unwrapping ‘Control’
Challenge
When a crisis occurs, the executive response is
highly scrutinized and must be rapid, coordinated
and precise. Information is imperfect, things
escalate quickly, and mistakes are very costly to
the reputation of the company – and increasingly
to its leaders.

What is needed?

Acting quickly and in control takes decisiveness:
• Mobilize crisis management team and support
• Decide your strategic intent
• Find necessary information
• Formulate position and key message
• Contain the situation
• Communicate with internal and external
stakeholders
• Evaluate continuously.
Core components
• Executive coaching, advice
and 2nd opinion
• (Cyber) incident response
• Forensics & intelligence
• Crisis communication
• Global 24/7 support
• Crisis management office

23

What is?
Intelligence-driven incident response

Unwrapping ‘Recover’
Challenge
Without attention and focus, recovery can be slow
and the loss of trust, disruptions to the business,
and damage to key relationships can linger. It is
easy to neglect the fact that much of the real work
begins after the storm is over.

What is needed?
Recovery after a major crisis takes focus and
effort:
•

Understand the crisis impact

•

Adjust strategy

•

Identify priorities and assign organizational
ownership

•

Coordinate medium and long-term plans

•

Liaise with important stakeholders and partners

•

Follow-up with authorities where relevant.

Core components
• Impact assessment
• Forensics
• Post Event Recovery Office
• Strategy and plan revision
• Stakeholder management
• Corporate communication.

What is?
Intelligence-driven incident response

Unwrapping ‘Learn’
Challenge
Often mistakes are repeated because organizations
fail to learn from crisis post-mortems, rely on tacit
knowledge, fail to train or to dedicate enough
resources to thoroughly test their written plans
through for example carefully scripted simulations.

Tax part of your finance transformation?
Hot topics
The tax environment continues to evolve at an increasing rate, particularly in light of additional legislative requirements, and new finance and tax
technologies.
1. SAF-T, eAudit and real-time reporting

5. VAT complexity

• Electronic transfer of large datasets to tax authorities.
• Move towards real-time reporting with daily or monthly submissions of
100+ data points, including e-invoicing.
• Covers multiple areas, including GL, AP, AR, FA, cash, and journal data.

• VAT complexity is increasing from place of supply rules across borders to the
provision of digital services and digital invoicing.
• Obtaining partial exemption data or calculating mixed recovery rates in
systems is becoming increasingly more sophisticated.

2. Making Tax Digital

6. BEPS & Country-By-Country Reporting

• From April 2019, the UK VAT return should be digitally submitted
to HMRC via an API, with digital links between systems involved
in the VAT return process, including ERP systems.
• Other taxes to follow after VAT.

• BEPS guidelines are designed to stop artificial movement of profits
to low-tax jurisdictions.
• CBCR is a reporting tool gathering financial and non-financial data
such as revenue and tax paid, or employee numbers and business
activity.

3. US Tax Reform

7. Operational Transfer Pricing

• US Tax Reform impacting global organisations with a US footprint
mean additional compliance requirements and potential impact on
system set-up. Also consider impact of Wayfair decision on local
nexus

4. SAP S/4 HANA and tax solutions
• Organisations to move from ECC/ERP to SAP HANA S/4
• In addition, HANA has 4 dedicated new tax products, including a tax
engine, an external tax reporting solution, an e-docs solution, and a data
analytics product.
© Deloitte 2018

8. Data

• Parts of the BEPS agenda focus on how profits are linked to the
underlying activity.
• Operational TP supports real time review of prices against actual and
forecast data.
• Tax and finance can make joint price setting decisions for recharges.

Data is becoming more and more important for many reasons. Advances in
technology and increasing legislation (e.g. GDPR) means that the importance of
data cannot be ignored and advanced organisations are looking at how to use data
to gain a real competitive advantage.

Tax part of your finance transformation?
why is it important to consider tax when implementing ERP
• Ever increasing (and often system-intrusive) legislative requirements means that tax cannot be ignored when implementing finance
transformation programmes. In addition, there are a number of reasons why tax has to be considered differently from other finance processes.
These include:
• Tax spans the system – other processes are naturally grouped by business function (finance, supply chain, etc.); tax has dependencies
across all of these areas
• The number of different taxes within ‘tax’ – it cannot be viewed as a single process, but must consider a wide range of different elements
including corporate taxes; VAT; transfer pricing; withholding taxes; employee tax reporting requirements (even where payroll is not in scope);
• Getting tax right is a statutory requirement - ‘nearly right’ is not an option, there are reputational and financial penalties for noncompliance and, in some jurisdictions, even criminal sanctions. BEPS Actions as well as newer requirements around eAudit and eFilings looking
to increase the need for compliant systems and processes for tax (see Systems Audit below).
• Cash benefits to be gained – it is our usual experience that, by providing more tax-optimised data from the system, there can be substantial
cash savings globally to the business. This usually only requires finessing of the system design, rather than wholesale changes so does not
attract a large cost – the savings are most commonly found in the jurisdictions where there is no in-country tax team and we have a checklist
of accelerators to identify such savings (see Common Areas of Benefit slide).
• The level of localisation required – each jurisdiction has a unique set of tax requirements – whilst these can usually be pooled into groups
of countries with similar requirements, the amount of localisation required for tax (and standardised processes) is often underestimated and
this impacts adversely on the quality of the final design that can be achieved.
• Systems audit – much more systems data and information is being collected by Tax Authorities which opens up an organisation’s ERP systems
to much more scrutiny than ever before. This includes newer global requirements around e-audit and e-filing of detailed information directly
from core systems, e.g. SAF-T and iXBRL in Europe and SPED in Brazil.

Common failures in ERP and tax
System failures…
• Tax determination logic: automation can still contain errors, manual leaves determination open to human error
• Tax codes: often insufficient tax codes to meet reporting requirements leading to manual intervention
• Reporting: standard reports often insufficient for each country
• Invoicing: layout or number sequences can be incorrect
• Foreign VAT: challenge to accommodate tax regimes and rules
• Master Data: Fields not set-up correctly, not mandatory, not owned

Other failures…
• Manual Work, Duplication of Effort, Interfaces: all raise risks
• Ownership: process and master data ownership not clear
• Training: inadequate for tax function on tax technology, and business on tax items
• Communication: not joined up approach during or after implementation
• Documentation: either insufficient or too technical

Tax part of your finance transformation?
However, the benefits of doing it right
Monetary…
• Global tax burden: May be improved with commercially integrated tax planning
• Cash flow benefits: accuracy, timing, earlier reclaims, bad debts
Data and Processes…
• Data Capture: improved data capture leading to more accurate tax treatment
• Transparency: transparent data allowing drill-down into details
• Consistency: Effective process with data applied consistently across the organisation
• Documentation: easier succession planning, and improve relations with tax authority
• Reconciliation: reduced reconciliation needed e.g. Intrastats to VAT return
• Pricing: difficult to get transparency and detailed data for pricing for transfer pricing purposes
• Errors: Potential for high profile errors reduced
Resources…
• Investigations: reduced cost of compliance to respond to enquiries and/or investigations
• Errors: reduces manual effort leading to reduction in cost and potential for human error
• Timely and accurate: no need to rework data so can focus on value-added activities

Competition

Talent

Companies are increasing cross-border
investments to grow and diversify and they are

competitors, markets, and business models
playing more important roles.

Scalability

There are an increasing number of companies
entering into transactions to create shareholder
value such as split ups, spinoffs, acquisitions and
divestures. Tax needs to have scale and agility
to support these transactions.

Is your organization up for the challenge?

The digital wave disrupting whole industries is now making its
way to the tax department.
The future of tax will see technology picking up the bulk of
manual and repetitive work. The human workforce will
represent a diverse cross-section of skills focused mainly on
tax planning for the organization. The workplace will be more
networked, devolved, mobile, team, and project-based,
collaborative, real-time, and fluid than ever before.
In this future, tax professionals face new demands. Critical
reasoning and thinking skills, the ability to connect the dots
across multiple areas, and a deep understanding of the
business will become as essential as the technical tax
experience they worked so hard to acquire. Done well,
however, this future has the potential to be the most engaging
and fulfilling in the history of a much-respected profession

Driv din virksomhed på data,

“The way you collect, manage
and use information will
determine whether you become
a winner or a loser.”

Bill Gates

Change and growth in business and
society are driven by insight, and
innovation is fuelled by data.
The ability to transform data and
information into insight and sound
decision-making is a key
differentiator.
Data in itself has become an asset
that threatens to disrupt current
business models while at the same
time allowing for innovation and
future growth.

How can I make analyses faster, better and cheaper?

Our aspiration is to create a competitive edge for
<Danish company> by growing an insight-driven
business system fuelled by data and information

Data supporting the business
strategy and being the

This means that we will:

part of everything we do and all the initiatives we take
• Build an effective and efficient solution delivery
capability that will encourage the organisation to ask
for more
• Challenge and inspire the organisation at all levels on
how to leverage analytics and new technological
opportunities to take ideas to the next level

• Support cost leadership as a lifestyle by democratising
data and information to optimise processes
• Bring data and insight to the hands of our users so
that they have the right information at the right place
at the right time.

Becoming an IDO is a C-level bet
Data mastery needs top-down leadership; it is an inherently
system-driven concept that requires coordination and investment
across the entire organisation

It is about willingness and ability

automate all operational decisions
