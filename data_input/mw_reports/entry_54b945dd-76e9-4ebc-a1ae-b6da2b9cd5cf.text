Industroyer2 Takes Aim at Ukraine Infrastructure

Since the outbreak of conflict in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, following Russia’s annexation
of Crimea, there have been several notable attempts to disrupt the electrical
infrastructure of the country. While an attack with Industroyer2 was recently thwarted,
analysis of this malware provides useful insight into threat actors’ behaviors.
Industroyer2 was first reported by CERT-UA and confirmed by ESET on April 12, 2022,
as the third major attempt at taking out part of Ukraine’s electrical substations and
controllers. This attack was repelled by CERT-UA in partnership with ESET.
This was just the latest in a string of attacks against Ukraine’s electric grid. The first
electrical disruption attempt occurred in December 2015, using an updated version of the
BlackEnergy malware. This attack successfully caused power outages in several regions of
Ukraine. In December 2016, the first version of Industroyer caused blackouts for several
hours in the capital, Kyiv.
The 2015 and 2016 attacks were both attributed to the Sandworm group. It is likely
Industroyer2 is yet another attempt by the Sandworm group to cause damage to the
critical infrastructure of Ukraine in support of the ongoing Russian incursions. The U.S.

Threat Thursday: Malware Rebooted - How Industroyer2 Takes Aim at Ukraine Infrastructure

Department of Justice has previously released indictments accusing the Russian GRU of
being behind BlackEnergy and Industroyer in an attempt to “undermine, retaliate
against, or otherwise destabilize” Ukraine, among other geopolitical targets.

Figure 1 – Compilation date
Industroyer2 was compiled on March 23, 2022, nearly a month after the initial invasion
of Ukraine. This threat was deployed alongside several wipers, a worm, and a loader.
CERT-UA reports that the wipers that came with the attack included CaddyWiper,
SoloShred, and AwfulShred. CaddyWiper targets Windows® systems, while the other
wipers target Linux® systems. The Linux worm OrcShred and the loader ArguePatch
were also included.
To understand how Industroyer2 works, we first need to look into the IEC 60870-5-104
protocol used for communication on a TCP/IP network. This protocol is used in the
Ukrainian electrical stations and substations that were targeted by this attack. By
following the commands used by the malware, we can observe the execution flow of
Industroyer2 and see what messages are sent to disrupt the targeted devices.

Threat Thursday: Malware Rebooted - How Industroyer2 Takes Aim at Ukraine Infrastructure

IEC-104
The IEC 60870-5-104 protocol, shortened as IEC-104, is a telecontrol equipment and
systems standardization for TCP communication over port 2404. This protocol is used to
interface with power control stations and substations.
An Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) transmission frame contains the Application
Service Data Unit (ASDU), which is a message structure carrying application data sent
between stations. The ASDU transmits an Information Object Address (IOA), which is
used to interact with the switches and breakers in a station. During normal everyday
function, a controller can send an APDU frame with an ASDU that contains specific IOA
commands to change the state of the stations and substations.
Status checking on the controller stations is carried out by sending a Test Frame
(TESTFR) command – TESTFR act APDU, to activate – which is verified with a return
– TESTFR con APDU, to confirm the system is online. The commands Start Data
Transfer (STARTDT) and Stop Data Transfer (STOPDT) control data transfer from the
control station. These actions are sent in an APDU.

Behavior
Once Industroyer2 is launched, a command prompt window opens and displays the
commands that are being sent and received, as seen in Figure 2. In this instance, we see
that port 2404 is being targeted. Port 2404 is used by IEC-104 to send TCP messages.
This output also corresponds to the IOA commands found inside the file, which are
shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 – Configuration found inside the file
A TESTFR act APDU is sent to establish a connection to a station, shown in Figure 4,
along with a STARTDT command. Upon successful connection, a TESTFR con APDU
is sent back from the station. With the confirmation received from the station, a
STARTDT APDU is sent to open data transfer. As with TESTFR, STARTDT will need
to send an act to activate, and to receive a con from the station to confirm, before data
transfer can begin.

Figure 4 – TESTFR act and STARTDT act commands
Next, the ASDU frames will communicate commands to the station, as shown in Figure 5.
An ASDU interrogation command determines the status of the station. The hardcoded
messages in Figure 3 will get sent and modify the station’s IOA.

Figure 5 – ASDU IOA commands
Not much else can be discerned from these IOA modifications without knowledge of the
specific systems that were being targeted. This points to the possibility that the malware
authors have some level of access or insider knowledge of the systems they were
attacking.

Industroyer vs. Industroyer2
While Industroyer2 is an updated version of the original Industroyer, it comes with a
slightly narrower scope of action. The original version of the threat had four distinct
modules targeting IEC 60870-5-101 (IEC-101), IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104), IEC-61850,
and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA).
IEC-101 is a protocol for controlling and monitoring electrical stations, while IEC-104
utilizes IEC-101 and sends communications over a TCP/IP network. IEC-61850 is a
communication standard for automated substation devices, and OPC DA is a client-server
standardization for real-time data acquisition devices.

Threat Thursday: Malware Rebooted - How Industroyer2 Takes Aim at Ukraine Infrastructure

Industroyer2 focuses primarily on disrupting services by targeting the IEC-104
controllers. It’s not clear why the focus was narrowed down to this one service, but
judging from the compilation date of March 23, 2022, the malware was likely rushed
through development. Additionally, Industroyer has a separate config file with the IOAs,
while Industroyer2 stores that information inside its executable.

Conclusion
Industroyer2 is the latest attempt by state-level threat actors to cause what they hope will
be severe damage to the critical infrastructure of the targeted region. This tactic has
proven effective in the past as a method of spooking the populace, even when the attack
itself was not successful.
Few details surrounding this specific attack are currently available to us, but what we do
know is that the deployment of Industroyer2 represents an increasing escalation of
cyberattacks on Ukraine’s crucial resources. Attackers are now escalating their intrusion
attempts far beyond the usual “smash-and-grab” tactics of infostealing, to focus on just
the “smash” part. This method of operation not only causes population distress and
widespread disruptions, but also has the potential to take out critical infrastructure in a
way that causes immediate damage to the basic services that keep countries functioning.
