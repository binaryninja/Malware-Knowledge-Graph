#StopRansomware: Hive Ransomware
SUMMARY
Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of
an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish
advisories for network defenders that detail various
ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors.
These #StopRansomware advisories include recently
and historically observed tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit
stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware
advisories and to learn more about other ransomware
threats and no-cost resources.

Actions to Take Today to Mitigate
Cyber Threats from Ransomware:
 Prioritize remediating known
exploited vulnerabilities.
 Enable and enforce multifactor
authentication with strong
passwords.
 Close unused ports and remove
any application not deemed
necessary for day-to-day
operations.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Hive IOCs and TTPs identified
through FBI investigations as recently as November 2022.
FBI, CISA, and HHS encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations
section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Victims of
ransomware operations should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA. For a
downloadable copy of IOCs, see AA22-321A.stix (STIX, 43.6 kb).

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 12. See MITRE
ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.
As of November 2022, Hive ransomware actors have victimized over 1,300 companies worldwide,
receiving approximately US$100 million in ransom payments, according to FBI information. Hive

ransomware follows the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model in which developers create,
maintain, and update the malware, and affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks. From June 2021
through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of
businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications,
Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH).
The method of initial intrusion will depend on which affiliate targets the network. Hive actors have
gained initial access to victim networks by using single factor logins via Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP), virtual private networks (VPNs), and other remote network connection protocols [T1133]. In
some cases, Hive actors have bypassed multifactor authentication (MFA) and gained access to
FortiOS servers by exploiting Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) CVE-2020-12812. This
vulnerability enables a malicious cyber actor to log in without a prompt for the user’s second
authentication factor (FortiToken) when the actor changes the case of the username.
Hive actors have also gained initial access to victim networks by distributing phishing emails with
malicious attachments [T1566.001] and by exploiting the following vulnerabilities against Microsoft
Exchange servers [T1190]:
•
•
•

CVE-2021-31207 - Microsoft Exchange Server Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability
CVE-2021-34473 - Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2021-34523 - Microsoft Exchange Server Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

After gaining access, Hive ransomware attempts to evade detention by executing processes to:
•
•
•

Identify processes related to backups, antivirus/anti-spyware, and file copying and then
terminating those processes to facilitate file encryption [T1562].
Stop the volume shadow copy services and remove all existing shadow copies via vssadmin
on command line or via PowerShell [T1059] [T1490].
Delete Windows event logs, specifically the System, Security and Application logs [T1070].

Prior to encryption, Hive ransomware removes virus definitions and disables all portions of Windows
Defender and other common antivirus programs in the system registry [T1112].
Hive actors exfiltrate data likely using a combination of Rclone and the cloud storage service Mega.nz
[T1537]. In addition to its capabilities against the Microsoft Windows operating system, Hive
ransomware has known variants for Linux, VMware ESXi, and FreeBSD.
During the encryption process, a file named *.key (previously *.key.*) is created in the root
directory (C:\ or /root/). Required for decryption, this key file only exists on the machine where it
was created and cannot be reproduced. The ransom note, HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt is dropped into
each affected directory and states the *.key file cannot be modified, renamed, or deleted, otherwise
the encrypted files cannot be recovered [T1486]. The ransom note contains a “sales department”
.onion link accessible through a TOR browser, enabling victim organizations to contact the actors
through a live chat panel to discuss payment for their files. However, some victims reported receiving
phone calls or emails from Hive actors directly to discuss payment.

TLP: CLEAR

TLP:CLEAR
The ransom note also threatens victims that a public disclosure or leak site accessible on the TOR
site, “HiveLeaks”, contains data exfiltrated from victim organizations who do not pay the ransom
demand (see figure 1 below). Additionally, Hive actors have used anonymous file sharing sites to
disclose exfiltrated data (see table 1 below).

Once the victim organization contacts Hive actors on the live chat panel, Hive actors communicate
the ransom amount and the payment deadline. Hive actors negotiate ransom demands in U.S.
dollars, with initial amounts ranging from several thousand to millions of dollars. Hive actors demand
payment in Bitcoin.
Hive actors have been known to reinfect—with either Hive ransomware or another ransomware
variant—the networks of victim organizations who have restored their network without making a
ransom payment.

Indicators of Compromise
Threat actors have leveraged the following IOCs during Hive ransomware compromises. Note: Some
of these indicators are legitimate applications that Hive threat actors used to aid in further malicious
exploitation. FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend removing any application not deemed necessary for
day-to-day operations. See tables 2−3 below for IOCs obtained from FBI threat response
investigations as recently as November 2022.

MITIGATIONS
FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend organizations, particularly in the HPH sector, implement the
following to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and
to reduce the risk of compromise by Hive ransomware:
•
•

•
•

•

•
•

Verify Hive actors no longer have access to the network.
Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are
released. Prioritize patching VPN servers, remote access software, virtual machine software,
and known exploited vulnerabilities. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management
system to automate and expedite the process.
Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail,
VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.
If used, secure and monitor RDP.
o Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and
using virtual desktop infrastructure.
o After assessing risks, if you deem RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating
sources and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse.
o If RDP must be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other
means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to
internal devices.
o Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of
attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused
remote access/RDP ports.
o Be sure to properly configure devices and enable security features.
o Disable ports and protocols not used for business purposes, such as RDP Port
3389/TCP.
Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. By instituting
this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have
irretrievable data.
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers
the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Ensure your backup data is not already infected.
Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login credentials
and change passwords/settings if applicable.

TLP: CLEAR

TLP:CLEAR
• Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.
• Enable PowerShell Logging including module logging, script block logging and transcription.
• Install an enhanced monitoring tool such as Sysmon from Microsoft for increased logging.
• Review the following additional resources.
o The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the
United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious
Activity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a network and
common mistakes to avoid in incident handling.
o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing
& Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways
to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack.
o StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for resources
to tackle ransomware more effectively.
If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend the
following actions.
•

•

•

Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and disable the
computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking capabilities. Ensure all
shared and networked drives are disconnected.
Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from the
network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices
that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by
ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers and
devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been
encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not
been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists.
Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan
your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.

In addition, FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to
prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents.

Preparing for Cyber Incidents
•

•
•

Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your
organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or
hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.
Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to
execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.
Document and monitor external remote connections. Organizations should document
approved solutions for remote management and maintenance, and immediately investigate if
an unapproved solution is installed on a workstation.

Page 9 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A

TLP: CLEAR

TLP:CLEAR
• Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,
storage device, the cloud).

Identity and Access Management
•

Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.
o Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64
characters in length.
o Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.
o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.
o Avoid reusing passwords.
o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.
o Disable password “hints.”
o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year unless a
password is known or suspected to be compromised.
Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular
and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in
users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.
o Require administrator credentials to install software.

•

Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent
possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical
systems.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or
unrecognized accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according
to the principle of least privilege.
Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For
example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed
and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust
model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable
admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual
users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a
specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain
task.

•
•
•

Protective Controls and Architecture
•

Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help
prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—
various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.

Page 10 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A

TLP: CLEAR

TLP:CLEAR
• Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral
movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly
useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon
network connections for each host.
• Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all
hosts.

Vulnerability and Configuration Management
•
•

•
•

Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and
lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat
actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or
moving laterally.
Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled.
Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access
necessary servers and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version
1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.

INFORMATION REQUESTED
The FBI, CISA, and HHS do not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may
embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in
the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not
guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI, CISA, and HHS understand that
when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect
their shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization
decide to pay the ransom, the FBI, CISA, and HHS urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents
to your local FBI field office, or to CISA at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. Doing so provides
investigators with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them
accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.
The FBI may seek the following information that you determine you can legally share, including:
•

Recovered executable files
