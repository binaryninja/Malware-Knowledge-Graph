The Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) team at ParaFlare recently helped an
Australian manufacturer impacted by Phobos ransomware. Unexpectedly, our investigation
found the ransomware affiliate had exploited the PrintNightmare vulnerability to escalate
privileges within two minutes of gaining initial access.

To our knowledge, there are no documented examples of the PrintNightmare vulnerability
being exploited by Phobos ransomware affiliates. So we decided to share our observations
and indicators from the investigation. . We are using the name “Luci” for this Phobos
ransomware affiliate due to the frequency of the terms “Luci” and “Lucifer” appearing in
filenames, code, registry values, and the name of the Local Administrator account created by
Luci.
In this article, we provide a brief introduction to the Phobos ransomware variant followed by
technical details related to the use of a PrintNightmare exploit by Luci in the initial stages of
the attack. Additional tools and techniques identified during the investigation will be
discussed in a separate article.

Phobos Ransomware Background
Phobos ransomware is a form of malicious software used by threat actors to encrypt files on
systems. The purpose is to extort a ransom fee from victims in exchange for restoring access
to their data. Phobos affiliates are financially motivated and opportunistic. Most victims are
small to medium sized businesses, though individuals have been impacted too.
The Phobos ransomware variant, closely related to Dharma and Crysis ransomware, first
emerged in 2018 and is used by criminals with varying technical abilities. Actors that use
Phobos ransomware are commonly known as “Phobos affiliates”. Distributors of Phobos
provide a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) style model to customers, enabling affiliates to
undertake attacks without the need to develop their own file encrypting malware.
Unlike many of the ransomware variants in the news (REvil, LockBit, Conti, etc.) Phobos
ransomware operators are not currently known to conduct data exfiltration for use in double
extortion style attacks (where a ransom fee is also demanded from victims to prevent the
publication of stolen data).
Phobos affiliates operate with greater autonomy, generally demand lower ransom amounts,
and demonstrate less professionalism, compared to more well-known ransomware variants.
While not as high profile, Phobos was one of the most reported variants of ransomware in
the first half of 2021, according to a report released by the Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network (FinCEN) of the United States Treasure Department1. FinCEN's observations were
consistent with 2021 ransomware statistics published by Emisoft which found Phobos was
the third most commonly reported ransomware strain of 2021.
The diversity of actors involved in deploying Phobos ransomware and their lack of
organisation means that variations in attack behaviour are more likely to be observed. In our
recent Phobos ransomware investigation, the affiliate we called Luci demonstrated more
individuality than most.

Initial Access Leveraging External Remote Services and Valid Accounts
2/9

ParaFlare’s observations of the attack patterns used by ransomware operators who obtain
initial entry into an environment via remote access solutions have remained relatively
consistent over the years. In almost all circumstances, our investigations found initial access
was obtained using a local or domain administrator account. Consequently, most actors
commenced their attack with privileged access and not much additional effort was required
for them to achieve their objectives.
Typically, remote access credentials are compromised either through phishing, credential
stuffing, brute forcing, or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in VPN appliances. The credentials
may be obtained or guessed directly by the ransomware operator or purchased from an
initial access broker. Insecure remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections are one of the
most common initial access vectors used in Phobos ransomware attacks.
In our recent investigation, we found Luci gained remote access to a terminal server using a
domain user account, $Printer_Maestro$, associated with a software package called
BarTender that was used in the client environment. While the account had limited privileges,
it had remote access rights, which was sufficient for Luci to gain initial access. It is unknown
how Luci obtained valid credentials.

Exploitation of Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability for Privilege Escalation
In circumstances where threat actors obtain remote access with a non-administrator account,
they need to find a way to escalate privileges to move laterally within the environment and
deploy ransomware. Known vulnerabilities are often exploited for this purpose, however, this
was the first time we had witnessed a PrintNightmare exploit used for privilege escalation in
a ransomware attack. At the time of publication, ParaFlare had not identified any
documented cases of PrintNightmare being exploited by Phobos ransomware affiliates.
PrintNightmare is a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service (spoolsv.exe) assigned
the identifier CVE-2021-34527. It is similar to other vulnerabilities including CVE-2021-1675.
Forty-five seconds after the first identified remote desktop session logon succeeded, Luci
copied a password protected, self-extracting archive (SFX) file called Lucimare.exe to the
desktop on the terminal server.
Although we were unable to successfully recover this SFX file, we can infer that it contained
malicious files designed to exploit the PrintNightmare vulnerability based on existing logs, the
SYSTEM registry, and artefacts recovered through file carving.
Our analysis found the Lucimare.exe SFX file contained a few files with modified times
between 4 July 2021 and 7 July 2021. Available file hashes can be found in the indicators of
compromise list at the end of the article.

Lucimare.exe was executed within 18 seconds from its first appearance on disk, resulting in
the extraction of files to the desktop folder.
Based on data contained in the AmCache.hve (which was recovered through file carving), it
appears LucimarePoc.exe was executed seven seconds later. Around the same time, three
files were written to the Print Spooler’s driver directory. Unfortunately, we were not able to
recover these files.
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\kernelbase.dll
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\AddUserX64.dll
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\mxdwdrv.dll
Remnant data suggests these files also existed in the directory
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\new
A suspicious spoolsv registry value was also set at this time with the name “LuciMarePoc”
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows
x64\Drivers\Version-3\LuciMarePoc
This contained references to the new drivers kernelbase.dll (Data File), AddUserX64.dll
(Configuration File), and mxdwdrv.dll (Driver).

An error with the Event ID 808 was recorded in the Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin
log specifying that “The print spooler failed to load a plug-in module
C:\Windows\system32\spool\DRIVERS\x64\3\AddUserX64.dll”. Additional logs (e.g.
Microsoft-Windows-PrintServer/Operational) that would record the successful printer plugin
loading were not enabled on the server.

5/9

Seconds later LucimarePoc2008.exe executed, followed closely by the creation of a
Windows Event log for Kaspersky Security, which had detected the file Lucimare.ps1 as
“HEUR:Exploit.PowerShell.NightMare.gen”.

6/9

During this time, a local administrator account called “Luciferium” was created on the server.
A RDP connection was established using this account less than three minutes after the initial
intrusion.
The remaining phases of the attack including credential access, lateral movement, and the
encryption of data will be covered in an upcoming post.

Recommendations
Ensure operating systems and applications are patched.
Secure remote access and enable multi-factor authentication for remote and
administrator accounts at a minimum.
Implement principle of least privilege and principle of least functionality across
accounts and servers.
Ensure there is sufficient, centralised logging.
