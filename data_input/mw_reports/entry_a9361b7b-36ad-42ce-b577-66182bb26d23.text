Lotus Blossom Continues ASEAN Targeting

February 13, 2018

During the last weeks of January (2018), nation state actors from Lotus Blossom conducted a targeted
malspam campaign against the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Just
months after the APT32 watering hole activity against ASEAN-related websites was observed in Fall
2017, this new activity clearly indicates the association (ASEAN) clearly remains a priority collection
target in the region. This new Lotus Blossom campaign delivers a malicious RTF document posing as
an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also carries an executable
(payload) embedded as an OLE object, the Elise backdoor.

The Elise backdoor is not new malware and has been successfully diagnosed in the past by Industry
researchers (e.g. Palo Alto Unit 42's 2015 report) and more recently by Volexity and Accenture.
Each of these are valuable resources to understanding the Elise malcode, infection
process, and known capabilities of the backdoor. In addition, a current ANY.RUN playback of our
observed Elise infection is also available.

Upon opening of the MS Word document, our embedded file exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop a
malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module, 'NavShExt.dll', which is then injected into
iexplore.exe to install the backdoor, begin collection, and activate command and control.

Moving through the infection process, NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit (CVE-2017-1182)
in action as the Microsoft Equation Editor, 'EQNEDT32.exe', scores high for potentially malicious
activity. This same process was also flagged in our any.run playback.

Our malware then spins up an instance of 'iexplore.exe' and injects 'NavShExt.dll' into that process.

While this is happening, the malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun in the registry and
then also creates 'thumbcache_1CD60.db' at
'Users\admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\' to store harvested data.

As the infection process completes, we now observe Elise network activity (e.g., exfil of victim data and
C2) through a conveniently hidden instance of Internet Explorer.

This traffic was also observed in NetWitness Packets, as the malware verifies the host IP address prior
to kicking off C2 out to 103.236.150[.]14, which is likely compromised infrastructure.

6/12

Take note of the cookie set in this HTTP POST, because Lotus Blossom actors go to significant lengths
to protect this data via both B64 encoding and AES encryption. The actual C2 for Elise takes place
over "cookie" code and (rarely) body content.

Other infections (from the identical payload) each generated their own decoy domains to populate the
host header, but in every case actually used the same hard-coded IP address, 103.236.150[.]14.

After our Elise infection had run for about a day, we were visited by the threat actor. While it's unclear
exactly what the actor may have been looking for, our infected (sandboxed) machine was not it and the
backdoor was deleted.

11/12

Based on both previous activity and this current Lotus Blossom campaign, it is clear that we
are witnessing the continued rise of cyber tradecraft and activity from nation-states in the Southeast
Asian theater.
