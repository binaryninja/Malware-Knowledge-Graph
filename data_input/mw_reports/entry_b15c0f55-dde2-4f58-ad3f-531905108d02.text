RatMilad, a newly discovered Android spyware, has been stealing data from mobile devices
in the Middle East.
The malware is spread through links on social media and pretends to be applications for
services like VPN and phone number spoofing. Unwary users download these trojan
applications and grant access to malware.

Loader Applications
Trojan apps named Text Me and NumRent were seen sideloading the RatMilad spyware.
The two apps claim to help verify social media accounts. They are unavailable on legitimate
application stores like Google Play but distributed on Telegram.
With more than 200 external shares, a post shared on a Telegram channel used to spread
the malware sample has received over 4,700 views.

Who is Behind RatMilad?
Zimperium claims that RatMilad’s operators obtained the source code from the AppMilad
hacker group in Iran and combined it with a fraudulent app to trick people into downloading
it.
Although it’s uncertain how widespread the infections are, the cybersecurity firm claimed it
found the spyware during an unsuccessful attempt to infiltrate a customer’s workplace
device.
According to Richard Melick, head of mobile threat intelligence at Zimperium, the RatMilad
spyware, and the Iranian-based hacking group AppMilad show a changing environment
impacting mobile device security.
RatMilad is only one of many mobile spyware options, including Pegasus and PhoneSpy,
accessible from both legitimate and illegitimate sources.
