Malware write-ups can be found in abundance online, they are often written from the point of
view of a malware researcher who focuses on the deep internals of how malicious software
works, in some cases the information provided cannot be used to derive actionable
intelligence and defence mechanisms by cybersecurity blue teams. With that said,
Researchers normally publish lists of hashes, file names, paths and IP addresses but these
are easily rotated by attackers and therefore quickly become redundant for defenders. So,
instead of looking for these fingerprints (which frequently change), we should instead look to
detect malware by its behaviours (which are relatively persistent and common across many
malware flavours). In this post, I hope to take a recent popular strain of malware and pick it
apart, not as a malware analyst but as a blue team defender to create intelligence that can
be used to detect malware based on its generalised behaviours instead of a stagnant list of
hashes, IPs or file names.

DarkSide Ransomware unleashed chaos on the Oil industry recently by demanding millions
of dollars to decrypt critical infrastructure networks. Thankfully Fireye has written up a great
report which illuminates some of the tactics employed by Darkside admins to inflict their
cryptographic nightmare. Although it seems Darkside is making a swift exit the methods they
use are common across many threat actors and therefore the advice below remains
applicable to other ransomware flavours.
Based on the evidence that DARKSIDE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors,
we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this
ransomware will continue to vary somewhat

Detection Opportunities

#1 Password attacks at the perimeter
Consumers of security tools are often led to believe that Ransomware is a complex threat
but for our first detection opportunity, we see quite the opposite.

2/7

In multiple cases we have observed suspicious authentication attempts against
corporate VPN infrastructure immediately prior to the start of interactive intrusion
operations. The authentication patterns were consistent with a password spraying
attack, though available forensic evidence was insufficient to definitively attribute this
precursor activity to UNC2628. In cases where evidence was available, the threat actor
appeared to obtain initial access through corporate VPN infrastructure using legitimate
credentials.
The attackers are simply logging into the victims VPN appliance and accessing the network
where they assume the permissions of the user whose credentials they have stolen. This
isn't a complex intrusion. It's just logging in. It could have been slowed or perhaps stopped
by modernising password policy and enabling two-factor authentication on the VPN gateway.
Defenders can detect this stage of the attack by monitoring VPN authentication logs
(normally Syslog directly from the VPN appliances or RADIUS) for multiple failed attempts.
Also, multiple failed attempts followed by success. Alert fidelity can be achieved in modern
SIEMs by applying baselining or machine learning to automatically detect anomalous
authentication instead of relying on a static threshold such as X auth failures in Y minutes.

Simplification of the attack for visual learners.
FireEye does also mention the attacker may have logged in with legitimate credentials, it
could be argued that the attackers stole or were sold a working username/password
combination. In this case, it's surely safe to assume that two-factor authentication would
have slowed down the attackers. Implementing 2FA is initially time-consuming but a breeze
to work with after the initial deployment hump. Some say that user workflow and productivity
is hampered by having a two-factor authentication process but thanks to modern push
notification solutions (like Duo and Azure) this simply isn't true. Your smartphone can send
you a push notification that you tap and unlock with biometrics adding fractions of a second
onto your login time. The pros of a more secure VPN outweigh the cons of a few extra
seconds of logon time.

#2 Exploitation of edge appliances.
Admittedly this section is only half a detection, the other half is patching advice.

3/7

FireEye noted that some Darkside attacks exploited CVE-2021-20016 for initial access. This
vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote commands to be executed against SonicWall
appliances. Anyone with an internet connection and the right set of instructions (SQL queries
in this case) can easily steal credentials from the SonicWall appliance and use them to break
into a network from the outside. This low effort, high yield attack is made possible by the
precarious location of edge networking appliances, bridging the internal and external
network.

Simplification of VPN appliances on the internet.
If your network has any edge appliances (Citrix, VPNs or similar) they must be promptly
patched when vulnerabilities are disclosed, the sooner the better. Failing to do so will
undoubtedly allow attackers in eventually.
It's possible to detect such vulnerabilities with an external vulnerability scanner or simply by
signing up for a notification service like https://secalerts.co.
In some cases, it's also possible to detect appliance attacks via their logs although this varies
by vendor and vulnerability. Knowing which logs to look at isn't always known until long after
the vulnerability has been published. In most cases, the appliance will write a Syslog
message or have a particular file in a particular location that shows the system has been
compromised. It's probably best not to count on this method for detecting networking
appliance intrusions. Prevention is better than the cure.

#3 Phishing
A group that Fireye have dubbed UNC2465 snuck Darkside in via the "Hamhock" backdoor.
It's hard to find much information about this backdoor other than what's provided in the
Fireye write up but it's possible to make educated guesses about its tactics based on the
snippets of information Fireye have included.
During one incident, the threat actor appeared to establish a line of communication
with the victim before sending a malicious Google Drive link delivering an archive
containing an LNK downloader. More recent UNC2465 emails have used Dropbox links
with a ZIP archive containing malicious LNK files that, when executed, would ultimately
lead to SMOKEDHAM being downloaded onto the system
4/7

So, UNC2465 delivered the Hamhock backdoor via phishing in two flavours. One using cloud
storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox and the other by hiding malicious LNK files
inside ZIPs and sending them directly to the victim. Fireeye has not shared many details
about the phishing kill chain but we can safely assume it looks something like these Any.Run
samples that abuse LNK files:
https://app.any.run/tasks/2f776569-a3be-42e4-a6af-732982c9b2ed/
https://app.any.run/tasks/2f776569-a3be-42e4-a6af-732982c9b2ed/
When boiled down this phishing attack is nothing more than delivering a shortcut file that
points towards a malicious command. The shortcut file is put in front of the user inside of a
ZIP file attachment or hidden behind a cloud file sharing link.
This isn't anything new and certainly isn't anything to be concerned about because long kill
chains like this grant many detection and prevention opportunities for us defenders.

A rough outline of the LNK kill chain as per AnyRun samples.
To detect and prevent this phishing method defenders should consider some or all of the
following actions:
Do not allow LNK files to be delivered as eMail attachments. Block LNK files from being
delivered to end-users.
Ensure that this block extends to LNK files inside of ZIPs. Most modern email gateways
can look inside ZIP files for malicious files.
Ensure that this block extends to LNK files inside of encrypted ZIPs. Attackers
sometimes password-protect ZIP files to stop eMail scanners from looking inside. This
particular protection may interrupt normal business workflows and therefore is not
suitable for everyone, your business should be consulted for appetite first.
Use EDR to monitor for archive software (WinZip, 7Zip, Unrar) writing .LNK files to disk
aka being extracted.
5/7

User EDR to monitor for a suspicious parent to child process relationships as per any
other malware. For example: CMD.exe > MSHTA.exe > PowerShell.exe. There's no
special sauce here. Once the attackers are on the network they still rely on traditional
code execution and foothold techniques, so stick to what you know and don't be
distracted by the fact that a new scary ransomware flavour is involved.

#4 Privilege escalation detection
After any hacker has gotten into her target network she will want to obtain high privileges so
she can spread deep into the network and encrypt as many systems as possible. Again,
there is no secret sauce here. The ransomware operators are using the same tried and true
techniques. Specifically called out by FireEye are Mimikatz, CVE-2020-1472 and LSASS
memory dumps. To detect and prevent these privilege escalation attacks, defenders should
implement as many of the below initiatives as possible:
Patch systems regularly and promptly. CVE-2020-1472 can be avoided by installing
patches.
Administrators must ensure that wdigest regkey is set to 0 on systems running
Windows 7, 8, Server 2008, and Server 2012. This stops plain text credentials from
being stored in memory. EDR tools should be used to monitor for modifications to the
wdigest registry key as attackers may try to modify it to weaken system security
Administrators should also ensure the RunAsPPLregistry key is set which stops tools
like Mimikatz from dumping the LSASS process memory where credentials are stored
in a hashed format.
As mentioned earlier, password policies must be modernised with length and longevity
in mind.
A large portion of common Microsoft domain attacks can be detected by Microsoft ATA,
now renamed to Microsoft Defender For Identity.
The agent runs on domain controllers where it can monitor for suspicious behaviour in
domain controller logs.

#5 Monitoring and controlling administrative tools
All of the hacking groups that deployed DarkSide were observed by Fireeye to be using
system administrator tools that have no place on a network except in very particular
circumstances. Defenders should look to strictly control access to the following tools:
Teamviewer
rClone
PSExec
FireEye directly calls out the fact that the attackers downloaded standard binaries for these
tools directly from the vendor source. (For example dl.teamviewer.com) This is interesting
because it highlights the fact that the attackers don't feel the need to hide this download,
6/7

obviously because it often goes undetected.
Defenders can detect and control the use of these tools using EDR Watchlists, Firewalls and
application control tools like AppLocker. If a user starts any of these applications without
proper permission or explanation their activity should be investigated.

#5 Protect ESXi
Mandiant observed the threat actor navigate to ESXi administration interfaces and
disable snapshot features prior to the ransomware encryptor deployment, which
affected several VM images.
I believe this claim to be profound because this isn't a commonly talked about attack vector
and few organisations are properly monitoring their virtual machine management consoles.
Defenders should work to implement as many of the following recommendations as possible
to protect their ESXi hosts from attacks like this.
Ensure that all virtual machine hosts are patched and running the latest software
available from the vendor. If you don't have a vulnerability management platform then
sign up to a service like https://secalerts.co/ for email alerts.
Control access to your ESXi hosts tightly, only share the credentials with employees
who need to know. Be sure to rotate the passwords after key administrators leave the
company.
Set long complex passwords for your ESXi server backends and store them in
password vaults like Secret Server, KeePass or BitWarden.
Monitor ESXI Syslog for multiple authentication failure events in a short period of time.
Ingest your ESXi Syslog logs into a monitoring platform and configure alarms that will
warn you of virtual machine snapshots being deleted in bulk.
