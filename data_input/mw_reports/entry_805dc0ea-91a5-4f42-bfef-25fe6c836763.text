Indictment Unsealed as U.S. Treasury Department Announces
Economic Sanctions
Monica Elfriede Witt, 39, a former U.S. service member and counterintelligence agent, has
been indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia for conspiracy to deliver and
delivering national defense information to representatives of the Iranian government. Witt,
who defected to Iran in 2013, is alleged to have assisted Iranian intelligence services in
targeting her former fellow agents in the U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC). Witt is also
alleged to have disclosed the code name and classified mission of a U.S. Department of
Defense Special Access Program. An arrest warrant has been issued for Witt, who remains
at large.
The same indictment charges four Iranian nationals, Mojtaba Masoumpour, Behzad Mesri,
Hossein Parvar and Mohamad Paryar (the “Cyber Conspirators”), with conspiracy, attempts
to commit computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft, for conduct in 2014 and 2015
targeting former co-workers and colleagues of Witt in the U.S. Intelligence Community. The

Cyber Conspirators, using fictional and imposter social media accounts and working on
behalf of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), sought to deploy malware that
would provide them covert access to the targets’ computers and networks. Arrest warrants
have been issued for the Cyber Conspirators, who also remain at large.
The announcement was made by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John
Demers, U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu for the District of Columbia, Executive Assistant Director
for National Security Jay Tabb of the FBI, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Special
Agent Terry Phillips of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and Assistant Director in
Charge Nancy McNamara of the FBI’s Washington Field Office.
“Monica Witt is charged with revealing to the Iranian regime a highly classified intelligence
program and the identity of a U.S. Intelligence Officer, all in violation of the law, her solemn
oath to protect and defend our country, and the bounds of human decency,” said Assistant
Attorney General Demers. “Four Iranian cyber hackers are also charged with various
computer crimes targeting members of the U.S. intelligence community who were Ms. Witt’s
former colleagues. This case underscores the dangers to our intelligence professionals and
the lengths our adversaries will go to identify them, expose them, target them, and, in a few
rare cases, ultimately turn them against the nation they swore to protect. When our
intelligence professionals are targeted or betrayed, the National Security Division will
relentlessly pursue justice against the wrong-doers.”
“This case reflects our firm resolve to hold accountable any individual who betrays the public
trust by compromising our national security,” said U.S. Attorney Liu. “Today’s announcement
also highlights our commitment to vigorously pursue those who threaten U.S. security
through state-sponsored hacking campaigns.”
“The charges unsealed today are the result of years of investigative work by the FBI to
uncover Monica Witt’s betrayal of the oath she swore to safeguard America’s intelligence and
defense secrets” said Executive Assistant Director for National Security Tabb. “This case
also highlights the FBI’s commitment to disrupting those who engage in malicious cyber
activity to undermine our country’s national security. The FBI is grateful to the Department of
Treasury and the United States Air Force for their continued partnership and assistance in
this case.”
“Treasury is taking action against malicious Iranian cyber actors and covert operations that
have targeted Americans at home and overseas as part of our ongoing efforts to counter the
Iranian regime’s cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “Treasury is
sanctioning New Horizon Organization for its support to the IRGC-QF. New Horizon hosts
international conferences that have provided Iranian intelligence officers a platform to recruit
and collect damaging information from attendees, while propagating anti-Semitism and
Holocaust denial. We are also sanctioning an Iran-based company that has attempted to
install malware to compromise the computers of U.S. personnel.”

“The alleged actions of Monica Witt in assisting a hostile nation are a betrayal of our nation’s
security, our military, and the American people,” said Special Agent Phillips. “While violations
like this are extremely rare, her actions as alleged are an affront to all who have served our
great nation.”
“This investigation exemplifies the tireless work the agents and analysts of the FBI do each
and every day to bring a complex case like this to fruition,’ said Assistant Director in Charge
McNamara. “Witt's betrayal of her country and the actions of the cyber criminals - at the
behest of the IRGC - could have brought serious damage to the United States, and we will
not stand by and allow that to happen. The efforts by the Iranian government to target and
harm the U.S. will not be taken lightly, and the FBI will continue our work to hold those
individuals or groups accountable for their actions.”
According to the allegations contained in the indictment unsealed today:
Monica Witt’s Espionage
Monica Witt, a U.S. citizen, was an active duty U.S. Air Force Intelligence Specialist and
Special Agent of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, who entered on duty in 1997
and left the U.S. government in 2008. Monica Witt separated from the Air Force in 2008 and
ended work with DOD as a contractor in 2010. During her tenure with the U.S. government,
Witt was granted high-level security clearances and was deployed overseas to conduct
classified counterintelligence missions.
In Feb. 2012, Witt traveled to Iran to attend the Iranian New Horizon Organization’s
“Hollywoodism” conference, an IRGC-sponsored event aimed at, among other things,
condemning American moral standards and promoting anti-U.S. propaganda. Through
subsequent interactions and communications with a dual United States-Iranian citizen
referred to in the indictment as Individual A, Witt successfully arranged to re-enter Iran in
Aug. 2013. Thereafter, Iranian government officials provided Witt with a housing and
computer equipment. She went on to disclose U.S. classified information to the Iranian
government official. As part of her work on behalf of the Iranian government, she conducted
research about USIC personnel that she had known and worked with, and used that
information to draft “target packages” against these U.S. agents.
Iranian Hacking Efforts Targeting Witt’s Former Colleagues
Beginning in late 2014, the Cyber Conspirators began a malicious campaign targeting Witt’s
former co-workers and colleagues. Specifically, Mesri registered and helped manage an
Iranian company, the identity of which is known to the United States, which conducted
computer intrusions against targets inside and outside the United States on behalf of the
IRGC. Using computer and online infrastructure, in some cases procured by Mesri, the
conspiracy tested its malware and gathered information from target computers or networks,
and sent spearphishing messages to its targets. Specifically, between Jan. and May 2015,

the Cyber Conspirators, using fictitious and imposter accounts, attempted to trick their
targets into clicking links or opening files that would allow the conspirators to deploy malware
on the target’s computer. In one such instance, the Cyber Conspirators created a Facebook
account that purported to belong to a USIC employee and former colleague of Witt, and
which utilized legitimate information and photos from the USIC employee’s actual Facebook
account. This particular fake account caused several of Witt’s former colleagues to accept
“friend” requests.

The case is being investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office with assistance from the
Air Force Office of Special Investigations. The prosecution is being handled by Assistant
U.S. Attorneys Deborah Curtis, Jocelyn Ballantine and Luke Jones of the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the District of Columbia with assistance from Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon of the
National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.
