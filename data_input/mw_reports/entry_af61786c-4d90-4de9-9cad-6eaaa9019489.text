A YEAR IN THREATS
2017
2017 represents a defining year in ICS security: two major and unique
ICS-disruptive attackers were revealed; five distinct activity groups
targeting ICS networks were identified; and several large-scale IT
infection events with ICS implications occurred.
While this represents a significant increase in ‘known’ ICS activity, Dragos
assesses we are only scratching the surface of ICS-focused threats. 2017
may therefore represent a break-through moment, as opposed to a highwater mark – with more activity to be expected in 2018 and beyond.
While our visibility and efforts at hunting are increasing, we recognize
that the adversaries continue to grow in number and sophistication. By
identifying and focusing on adversary techniques – especially those which
will be required in any intrusion event – ICS defenders can achieve an
advantageous position with respect to identifying and monitoring future
attacks. This report seeks to inform ICS defenders and asset owners on
not just known attacks, but to provide an overview for how an adversary
must and will operate in this environment moving forward. By adopting
a threat-centric defensive approach, defenders can mitigate not just the
adversaries currently known, but future malicious actors as well.

PERSPECTIVE

| INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM THREATS
2017 ICS THREAT REVIEW

2017 was a watershed year in industrial control systems (ICS) security largely due to
the discovery of new capabilities and a significant increase in ICS threat activity groups.
Cybersecurity risks to the safe and reliable operation of industrial control systems have
never been greater. While numerous, incidental infections occur in industrial networks
on a regular basis, ICS-specific or ICS-tailored malware is rarer.

P

rior to 2017 only three families of ICS-specific malware were known: STUXNET, BLACKENERGY
2, and HAVEX. In 2017 the world learned of two new ICS-specific malware samples: TRISIS and
CRASHOVERRIDE. Both of these samples led to industry firsts. CRASHOVERRIDE was the first
malware to ever specifically target and disrupt electric grid operations and led to operational
outages in Kiev, Ukraine in 2016 (although it was not definitively discovered until 2017). TRISIS is
the first malware to ever specifically target and disrupt safety instrumented systems (SIS), and
is the first malware to ever specifically target, or accept as a potential consequence, the loss of
human life. The impact of these events cannot be understated.
The number of adversaries targeting control systems and their investment in ICS-specific capabilities
is only growing. There are now five current, active groups targeting ICS systems – far more than our
current biases with respect to the skill, dedication, and resources required for ICS operations would
have us believe possible. These events and continued activity will only drive a hidden arms race for
other state and non-state actors to mature equivalent weapons to affect industrial infrastructure and
ensure parity against possible adversaries.
We regrettably expect ICS operational losses and likely safety events to continue into 2018 and the
foreseeable future.

| 2017 ICS THREATS
A SUMMARY

2017 featured multiple, concerning developments within the ICS security space. On a general
level, wormable ransomware such as WannaCry and NotPetya provided notice to ICS owners
and operators that industrial networks are far more connected to the IT environment than
many realized. While significant and – for some organizations – costly, 2017 also featured some
targeted events led by activity groups focused exclusively on the ICS environment.
Previously, defenders perceived ICS threat actors as rare with significant technical limitations
or hurdles to overcome. But 2017 demonstrated – either because ICS is an increasingly enticing
target, or because researchers and defenders are merely ‘looking harder’ – that these groups
are more common than previously thought. Toward that end, Dragos identified five active, ICSfocused groups that displayed various levels of activity throughout 2017. While only one has
demonstrated an apparent capability to impact ICS networks through ICS-specific malware
directly, all have engaged in at least reconnaissance and intelligence gathering surrounding the
ICS environment.
Overall, the scope and extent of malicious activity either directly targeting or gathering information
on ICS networks increased significantly throughout 2017.

As a result of these events, Dragos has been able to analyze and develop strategies
for defending and mitigating various types of attack against ICS assets.

03

| NEW ICS-FOCUSED MALWARE
2017 witnessed a dramatic expansion in ICS security activity and awareness. During the year,
Dragos identified and analyzed CRASHOVERRIDE, responsible for the Ukraine power outage
event that occurred in December of 2016, and then discovered and analyzed TRISIS, the first ICS
malware designed to target industrial safety systems in November. Considering that defenders
knew of only three ICS-focused malware samples before 2017 – STUXNET (pre-2010),
BLACKENERGY2 (2012), and HAVEX (2013), the emergence and discovery of two more this year
indicates that adversaries are focusing more effort and resources on ICS targeting, and those
capabilities are expanding.

| TRADITIONAL IT MALWARE CRIPPLING OPERATIONAL NETWORKS
Early 2017 saw the release of the EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010) and the subsequent
WannaCry ransomware worm. The infection of operational networks with this ransomware
and operational disruption illustrated the symbiotic relationship between the two networks.
While engineers and operations staff have long held the separation between “business” and
“operational” environments as the ICS model, the border is increasingly permeable and therefore
operational ICS networks are facing traditional business threats.
Closely following the WannaCry ransomware adversaries launched NotPetya. What was unique
is that this was a wiper masquerading as ransomware appearing to initially target Ukraine
business and financial sectors. In addition to weaponizing the EternalBlue exploit, NotPetya
leveraged credential capture and replay to provide multiple means of propagation, resulting in
rapid spreading to organizations well-removed from Ukrainian business sectors. Perhaps the
most sobering example is Maersk, which is estimated to have lost up to $300 million USD while
also having to rebuild and replace most of its IT and operations network.1
To combat malware infection events such as the above examples, Dragos pursues ‘commodity’,
non- ICS-focused malware through the MIMICS project: Malware In Modern ICS Environments. By
aggressively hunting for standard IT threats that can pose a specific danger to ICS environments,
Dragos works to provide early warning and defensive guidance on potentially overlooked threats.

| ADVERSARIES STAYING BUSY: ICS-FOCUSED ACTIVITY
Dragos currently tracks five activity groups targeting ICS environments: either with an ICSspecific capability, such as CRASHOVERRIDE or with an intention to gather information and
intelligence on ICS-related networks and organizations. These groups have remained relatively
constant regarding overall activity throughout the year, and Dragos is confident that additional
unknown events have occurred.

| RECOMMENDATIONS

An ICS intelligence-driven approach to threat intelligence is not universal. Indicators of compromise
are not intelligence and will not save any organization. Organizations must understand and consume
ICS-specific threat intelligence to monitor for adversary behaviors and tradecraft instead of simply
detecting changes, anomalies, or after-the-fact indicators of compromise.2

2

DETECTION-IN-DEPTH

ASSUME BREACH

Just as defense-in-depth is a necessary
component of modern cybersecurity,
detection-in-depth must become a necessary
component across all industrial control levels.
Enhanced monitoring must especially Include
any permeable “barriers” such as the IT-OT
network gap. ICS networks are increasingly
connected not only to the IT network but
also directly to vendor networks and external
communication sources leaving monitoring of
the IT environments alone entirely inefficient.

Disruptive ICS-specific malware is real,
traditional IT threats now regularly cross
the “IT-OT” divide, and ICS knowledgeable
activity groups are targeting industrial
infrastructure directly instead of just the
IT networks of industrial companies.
Gone are the days of protection via a
segmented network – detection is the
first component of an assume- breach
model – you can only respond to what
you can see.

ICS-SPECIFIC INVESTIGATIONS

RESILIENCE AGAINST CYBER ATTACK

In the event of a breach or disruption there
must be ICS-specific investigation capabilities
and ICS-specific incident response plans.
This is the only effective way of identifying
root cause analysis and reducing mean time
to recovery in the operations environments
when facing industrial specific threats.

Resiliency analysis and engineering
surrounding industrial processes must
include cyber-attacks. For example,
safety systems must be designed and
operated with the understanding that
they may now be purposefully attacked
and undermined.

To understand ICS threat intelligence read the Dragos whitepaper “Industrial Control Threat Intelligence”

ICS THREATS
IN DETAIL

06

| CRASHOVERRIDE
Although taking place in late December 2016, the ICS
security community did not fully understand the extent
and significance of the 2016 Ukrainian power outage
until later in 2017. After identifying samples, Dragos
determined that specifically-tailored malware caused the
2016 event by manipulating the breakers at the target
substation in Ukraine.
At the time, this represented only the second instance
where malware was utilized to directly impact an ICS
device or process with little human intervention – the
other example being the Stuxnet worm. In this case, the
adversary developed a modular attack framework that
combined a reasonably protocol-compliant manipulation
program to create an ICS impact (opening breakers
to generate a power outage), with malicious wiper
functionality to impede and delay system recovery.

Further investigation identified a distinct activity group behind the CRASHOVERRIDE
event, as both a developer and attacker: ELECTRUM. As detailed below, ELECTRUM
is assessed to be a highly sophisticated, well-resourced activity group that remains
active.
Defenders lack any knowledge of CRASHOVERRIDE itself or similar capabilities used after the
December 2016 event. While CRASHOVERRIDE, as deployed in the Ukraine attack, is not capable
of impacting environments dissimilar to the equipment and protocol setup at the target utility,
the framework and method of operations deployed provide an example for other adversaries to
follow. Examples of new ‘tradecraft’ to emerge from CRASHOVERRIDE include: leveraging ICS
protocols to create a malicious impact; creating modular malware frameworks designed to work
with multiple protocols; and incorporating automatically-deployed wiper functionality chained to
an ICS impact.
Thus, even if CRASHOVERRIDE itself cannot be used again outside of very narrow circumstances,
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by it can be adapted to new
environments. By identifying these TTPs and building defenses around them, organizations can
prepare themselves for the next CRASHOVERRIDE-like attack, rather than focusing exclusively
on the specific events from December 2016 leaving the enterprise open and undefended against
even minor variations in the attack.

07

| TRISIS
TRISIS is the third-recorded ICS attack executed via malware, the previous two being Stuxnet
and CRASHOVERRIDE (see above). TRISIS is a specifically-targeted program designed to upload
new ladder logic to Schneider Electric Triconex safety systems. The malware utilizes a speciallycrafted search and upload routine to enable overwriting ladder logic within memory based on a
deep understanding of the Triconex product.
Unique compared to past ICS events, TRISIS targeted safety instrumented systems (SIS), those
devices used to ensure system remain in and fail to a ‘safe’ state within the physical environment.
By targeting SIS, an adversary can achieve multiple, potentially dangerous impacts, ranging from
extensive physical system downtime to false safety alarms, physical damage, and destruction.
Additionally, by targeting a SIS the adversary must either intend or willfully accept the loss of
human life from the operation.

Although extremely concerning both as an attack and as an extension of ICS
operations to cover SIS devices, TRISIS represents a highly-targeted threat.
Specifically, TRISIS is designed to target a specific variant of Triconex systems.
Additionally, an adversary would need to achieve extensive

access

to and

penetration of a target ICS network to be in a position to deliver a TRISIS-like attack.
While TRISIS is profoundly concerning and represents a
significant new risk for defenders to manage, TRISIS-like
attacks require substantial investments in both capability
development and network access before adversary
success.
While ICS defenders and asset owners should note the
above regarding TRISIS’ immediate impact, in the longerterm TRISIS is likely to have a concerning effect on the
ICS security space. Specifically, while TRISIS itself is
not portable to any environment outside of the specific
product targeted in the attack, the TRISIS tradecraft has
created a ‘blueprint’ for adversaries to follow concerning
SIS attacks. This is not bound to any specific vendor and
vendors such as ABB maturely and rightfully stated that
similar styled attacks could equally impact their products.
Furthermore, the very extension of ICS network attack to
SIS devices sets a worrying precedent as these critical
systems now become an item for adversary targeting.

| DISRUPTIVE IT MALWARE
IT malware infecting and causing issues in
operational networks is not a new phenomenon.
Tracking the metrics related to these infections
has always been difficult due to collection
issues from these environments. This led to very
low metrics, such as the ICS- CERT’s consistent
~200 incidents each year, to very high metrics
including some vendors claiming upwards
of 500,000 infections a year. For this reason,
Dragos created the Malware in Modern ICS
(MIMICS) project in late 2016 and running
through early 2017.3 The research performed
a census-styled metrics count of infections in
ICS networks and identified around 3,000 unique
industrial infections during the research period.
This led to the estimate of around 6,000 unique
infections in industrial environments every year
including various types of viruses, trojans, and
worms. While any of these infections could
cause issues in operational environments none
represented the type of disruption that would
come from the latest generation of ransomware
worms.
WannaCry appeared in May 2017 following the
weaponization of the MS17-010 vulnerability
in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB)
protocol (EterenalBlue), released as part of
the ‘Shadow Brokers’ continual leak of alleged
National Security Agency hacking tools.
WannaCry itself was a form of ransomware
designed to self-propagate via the MS17-0104
vulnerability, resulting in not only a quick spread
globally but also the systematic infection of
networks due to the malware’s ‘wormable’
nature.

09

While ransomware is typically not a concern for ICS defenders,
WannaCry challenged the traditional view due to its selfpropagating method exploiting a common ICS communication
mechanism (SMB).
Various data transfer functions, such as moving data from the ICS
network (e.g., historians) to the business network for business
intelligence purposes, rely upon SMB for functionality. Combined
with poor patch management and enabling older, vulnerable forms of
SMB instead of the newer SMB version 3 variant, hosts within the ICS
network were not only reachable through pre-existing connections to
the IT network but vulnerable as well.
The result of the above circumstances was WannaCry spreading into
and impacting ICS environments, including automotive manufacturers
and shipping companies. The impact to operations from system loss
due to encryption certainly varies, but in ICS environments the damage
potential is significant regarding lost production and capability.
Furthermore, WannaCry was not the only ransomware type to
implement worm-like functionality, with additional malware NotPetya
and BadRabbit emerging over the course of 2017. Of these, NotPetya
was especially concerning for several reasons: first, it included
multiple means of propagation through credential capture and reuse aside from relying solely on the MS17- 010 vulnerability; second,
the malware was effectively a ‘wiper’ as encrypted filesystems could
not be recovered. Although initially targeting Ukrainian enterprises,
NotPetya soon spread to many organizations resulting in significant
system impacts and, in several documented cases, production losses
in ICS environments.
Although not targeted at ICS environments, the impact of WannaCry and
related malware demonstrates the capability for IT-focused malware
to migrate into ICS environments. While patching may not be a viable
solution for ICS defenders in cases such as MS17-010, strengthening
and hardening defenses at porous boundaries could help.

ACTIVITY GROUPS
Dragos tracks and organizes related threat activity as ‘activity
groups’: essentially, combinations of behavior or techniques,
infrastructure, and victimology.5 This process avoids the
potentially messy and hard-to- prove traditional attribution
route – aligning activity to specific actors or nation-states
– while also providing concrete benefits to defenders by
organizing observed attackers into collections of identified
actions.
Within the scope of ICS network defense, Dragos currently
tracks five activity groups that have either demonstrated the
capability to attack ICS networks directly or have displayed
an interest in reconnaissance and gaining initial access into
ICS-specific entities.

The concept of activity groups comes from The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis: http://www.diamondmodel.org/

ELECTRUM

E

LECTRUM is responsible for the 2016 Ukrainian power outage event, created
through CRASHOVERRIDE. In addition to this signature, high-profile event, Dragos
has linked ELECTRUM with another group, the SANDWORM Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) (iSight), responsible for the 2015 Ukrainian outage. ELECTRUM
previously served as the ‘development group’ facilitating some SANDWORM activity
– including possibly the 2015 Ukrainian power outage – but moved into a
development and operational role in the CRASHOVERRIDE event.
While ELECTRUM does not have any other high-profile events to its name as of this
writing, Dragos has continued to track on- going, low-level activity associated with
the group. Most notably, 2017 did not witness another Ukrainian power grid event,
unlike the previous two years. Based on available information, ELECTRUM remains
active, but evidence indicates the group may have ‘moved on’ from its previous
focus exclusively on Ukraine.
While past ELECTRUM activity has focused exclusively on Ukraine, ongoing activity
and the group’s link to SANDWORM provide sufficient evidence for Dragos to assess
that ELECTRUM could be ‘re-tasked’ to other areas depending on the focus of their
sponsor.

Given ELECTRUM’s past activity and ability to successfully operate within the
ICS environment, Dragos considers them to be one of the most significant and
capable threat actors within the ICS space.

12

COVELLITE
C

OVELLITE First emerged in September 2017, when Dragos identified a
small, but highly targeted, phishing campaign against a US electric grid
company. The phishing document and subsequent malware – embedded
within a malicious Microsoft Word document – both featured numerous
techniques to evade analysis and detection. Although the attack identified
is particular to the one targeted entity, Dragos soon uncovered attacks with
varying degrees of similarity spanning Europe, North America, and East Asia.

Common to all of these observed COVELLITE-related instances was the use
of similar malware functionality, including the use of HTTPS for command and
control (C2), and the use of compromised infrastructure as C2 nodes.
As Dragos continued tracking this group, we identified similarities in both
infrastructure and malware with the LAZARUS GROUP APT6 (Novetta), also referred
to as ZINC (Microsoft), and HIDDEN COBRA (DHS). This activity group has variously
been associated with destructive attacks against Sony Pictures7 and to bitcoin theft
incidents in 2017.8 While Dragos does not comment on or perform traditional
nation-state attribution, the combination of technical ability plus the willingness to
launch destructive attacks displayed by the linked group LAZARUS make COVELLITE
an actor of significant interest.
Dragos has yet to identify another grid- specific targeting event since September 2017
although similar malware and related activity continue. Finally, noted capabilities
thus far would only suffice for initial network access and reconnaissance of a target
network – COVELLITE has not used or shown evidence of an ICS-specific capability.

13

DYMALLOY
Dragos began tracking the activity group we refer to as DYMALLOY in response to
Symantec’s ‘Dragonfly 2.0’ report. Importantly, Dragos found a significant reason
to doubt an association to the legacy Dragonfly ICS actor with the newly-identified
activity.
Dragonfly was originally active from 2011 to 2014 and utilized a combination of
phishing, strategic website compromise, and creating malicious variants of legitimate
software to infiltrate ICS targets. Once access was gained, Dragonfly’s HAVEX9
malware leveraged OPC communications to perform survey and reconnaissance
activities within the affected networks.

Although no known destructive attacks emerged from these events, Dragonfly
proved itself to be a capable, knowledgeable entity able to penetrate and
operate within ICS networks.

D

YMALLOY is only superficially similar to Dragonfly, in that the group
utilized phishing and strategic website compromises for initial access.
However, even at this stage, DYMALLOY employed credential harvesting
techniques by triggering a remote authentication attempt to attackercontrolled infrastructure, significantly different from the exploits deployed by
Dragonfly. All subsequent activity shows dramatic changes in TTPs between
the groups, such as differences between the content and targeting of the
phishing messages, and the outbound SMB connections.

Dragos, Inc. | www.dragos.com | @DragosInc | version 1.0

14

Although DYMALLOY does not appear to be linked with Dragonfly, or at least
not directly, the group remains a threat to ICS owners.
Starting in late 2015 and proceeding through early 2017, DYMALLOY was able to
successfully compromise multiple ICS targets in Turkey, Europe, and North America.
Dragos has also learned that, while the group does not appear to have a capability
equivalent to Dragonfly’s HAVEX malware, the group was able to penetrate the
ICS network of several organizations, gain access to HMI devices, and exfiltrate
screenshots. While less technically sophisticated than HAVEX, such activity shows
clear ICS intent and knowledge of what information could be valuable to an attacker
– either to steal information on process functionality in the target environment or to
gather information for subsequent operations.
Since Symantec’s public reporting, followed by additional US-CERT notifications
several weeks later, Dragos has not identified any additional DYMALLOY activity.
While analysts found some traces of DYMALLOY-related malware in mid-2017, no
artifacts or evidence suggesting DYMALLOY operations appear since early 2017.
Given the publicity, Dragos assesses with medium confidence that DYMALLOY has
reduced operations or significantly modified them in response to security researcher
and media attention.

Dragos, Inc. | www.dragos.com | @DragosInc | version 1.0

15

CHRYSENE

C

HRYSENE is an evolution of on-going activity which initially focused on
targets in the Persian or Arabian Gulf. CHRYSENE emerged as an off-shoot
to espionage operations – as well as potential preparation actions before
destructive attacks such as SHAMOON10 – that focused mostly on the Gulf area
generally, and Saudi Arabia specifically. CHRYSENE differs from past activity
in that it utilizes a unique variation of a malware framework employed by other
groups such as Greenbug (Symantec) and OilRig (Palo Alto Networks), with
a very particular C2 technique reliant upon IPv6 DNS and the use of 64-bit
malware.

Where CHRYSENE mostly differentiates itself is in targeting: all observed
CHRYSENE activity focuses on Western Europe, North America, Iraq, and
Israel. CHRYSENE targets oil and gas and electric generation industries
primarily within these regions. This activity first emerged in mid-2017 and has
continued at a steady state since.
While CHRYSENE’s malware features notable enhancements over related threat
groups using similar tools, Dragos has not yet observed an ICS-specific capability
employed by this activity group. Instead, all activity thus far appears to focus on
IT penetration and espionage, with all targets being ICS-related organizations.
Although CHRYSENE conducts no known ICS disruption, the continued activity and
expansion in targeting make this group a concern that Dragos continues to track.

MAGNALLIUM

D

RAGOS began tracking MAGNALLIUM in response to public reporting
by another security company on a group identified as ‘APT33’ (FireEye).
The press initially treated MAGNALLIUM as a significant threat to ICS and
critical infrastructure. A subsequent investigation by Dragos indicated that
all of this group’s activity focused on Saudi Arabia, specifically governmentrun or -owned enterprises in petrochemicals and the aerospace industry.

While the group targets organizations which contain ICS, the lack of an ICSspecific capability combined with the group’s very narrow targeting profile
make this less of a concern.
We continue to monitor MAGNALLIUM to determine if targeting changes, or if
this group’s actions splinter resulting in new, ‘out of area’ operations, as observed
with CHRYSENE.
