In order to gain access to the Domain Controller, the attacker needs to harvest the
credentials as well as understand the network structure and then using PsExec traverse to
the next computer.

In the case of a successful breach, the attacker will perform a final procedure aimed at
avoiding detection in order to hide their illicit activities.

of files and other backups using VSSadmin.exe. At the end of the attack, the ransomware is
deployed to the targeted endpoints, and this completes the final stage of the attack.
