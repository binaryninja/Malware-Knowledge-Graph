4.1. IoC sharing

Group-A
Group-B

Early information sharing against malspam enables each
organization to block IoCs by analysis.
・Email subject
・Attachment file information
Link information
・Malicious destination
This campaign has been stopped for few month,
malspam got sophisticated after break.
78

4.2. Monitoring Cutwail

Group-A
Group-B

・We are monitoring malspam sending operation by
Cutwail in our bot farm.
-Analyzing and decrypting communication protocol to
obtain malspam templates
・The biggest advantage is getting malspam info ASAP.
(e.g. We can identify the all malspam’s subject with same
hash value of attached file. )
79

4.3. Sinkhole DGA domain

Group-B

Ursnif-B utilized C2 domain by DGA in Dec. 2018.
-Analyzed DGA
-Preemptively acquired domains and prevent C2 communication.
-Identification and notification of infected hosts
Campaign has been stopped until Apr. 2019.

4.4. Coordination of compromised email account

・Group-B utilized delivery route via compromised email accounts.
・Extracted source IP from received mail and notified them
Mainly old domestic email accounts were compromised.
・This delivery channel has been retired for several months
due to continual coordination (60 cases).

81

4.5. Forecast for C2 domain

Group-A

・Bebloh’S C2 domains have characteristics.
・Predict the domain of C2 and check if this IP is used for C2
before spreading malspam
・Domain prediction enables continuous monitoring of C2
before spreading malspam.
・Sinkhole implementation for Bebloh DGA domain
Malspam campaign targeting Japan stopped since 2019/06

4.6. Result of active defense against Group-A

Group-A

Malspam from Group-A on 2019/6/17 was the last for Japan.
After that, target was changed to Germany, Poland and the US
started, mainly in Italy.

4.6. Result of active defense against Group-B

Group-B

・ Changed delivery route to Emotet from 2019/09
Ursnif's WebInjectionConfig via Ursnif-B and Emotet
matches including manipulation server’s information
・Group-B changed malware from Ursnif to Trickbot from
Oct. 2019.
(Target list Ursnif-B and Trickbot have matches.)

・ The attackers have changed their TTPs and still continue to
target Japan.
89

[WebInjectionConfig of Trickbot]

Group-B

Targeted companies in Japan has been added to WebInjectionConfig
since 2019/10/15
Japan accounts for around 30% of the total
(rcrd = 1571300200126636 for Japan)

[gtag of Trickbot]

Group-B

Trickbot Varies gtag by malware
・ gtag morXX via Emotet
・ gtag leoXX via Ursnif
・ gtag tinXX via IcedID
・ gtag onoXX via malspam (zip-lnk-vbs)
・ gtag satXX via malspam (xls)
However, all gtags have the same WebInjetionConfig
The association between the groups of attackers using
Trickbot is unclear.

Classification of malspam to Japan

93

5. Countermeasure against malspam
・ Don’t allow the mail to send to the mailbox.
・ Implement e-mail security products and leverage IoCs
・ If complomised, find Proxy logs with IoCs
・ Catch malspam information quickly and get IoCs

94

5.1. Application to mail security products
Introduce a mail security product
Monitoring and blocking operation below
・ Email subject
・ E-mail User-Agent
・ The IP address of the sender of the mail
・ Attachment name
・ Attachment extension
ex) Unique User-Agent of Cutwail-B
95

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101↵
Thunderbird/45.2.0

5.2. Proxy Protection
Use IoCs (twitter)
・ Monitor and block outbound traffic through Proxy.
・ Malware download domains are relatively short-lived
C2 domains are relatively static
Detect Ursnif check-in traffic
(domain)/images/(random 150+ strings include /).jpeg
# other .avi, .gif, .bmp
96

6. Summary
・The analysis of the e-mail campaign revealed two groups
and their TTPs.
・Analyzing their TTPs can lead to more aggressive defenses.
・ We believe Group-A pulled out of Japan by our active defense.
