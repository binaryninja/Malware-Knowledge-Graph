Latest Elise APT comes packed with Sandbox Evasions
joesecurity.org/blog/8409877569366580427

Recently we came across an interesting sample which seems to be related to Elise Malware.
Elise is tight to the Dragon Fish and Lotus Blossom APT groups which primary targets
governments and defense contractors. Elise is known to infect victims by using the latest
exploits available and is often packed with interesting Sandbox evasion techniques.
In this blog post, we will dissect the latest version of Elise.
The sample under investigation is distributed as an Office document lure. To be more precise
in Rich Text Format.

CVE-2018-0802
We start the analysis by having a look at the behavior graph and acknowledge that the
process EQNEDT32.EXE was started among Winword.exe:

This process is the Microsoft Office Equation Editor. In November 2017 the security company
Embedi detected an exploit in EQNEDT32.EXE which later got the identification CVE-201711882. Microsoft patched the flaw in November.
So, is Elise using this exploit? To answer this question we had a detailed look at the exploit
itself. The outcome: no it is not CVE-2017-11882 but rather CVE-2018-0802. CVE-20180802? This a second exploit also included in EQNEDT32.EXE which was detected in later
December.
We extracted the trampoline and shellcode:

The code renames and loads the PE file (named a.b) previously dropped by Word. The
newly loaded code is then injected into IExplorer.exe where the main payload is executed:

Sandbox Evasions
Elise performs a variety of sandbox checks in In IExplorer:

VMware backdoor check

5/12

Disk Name Check

6/12

Check for various Analysis Tools

7/12

Process Check

8/12

Mac Address Check

Payloads
After passing all the sandbox checks Elise creates an autostart key:

9/12

Thanks to Hybrid Code Analysis we can also detect all malicious functionalities:

Add a Proxy to Internet Explorer

10/12

Add a Proxy to Firefox

Finally, in function 514D05, 5159AF and 515486 we find the download, upload and
command execution handlers. Elise can collect and upload the following data:

CPU Usage
Ram (size/free)
Disk space (size/free)
Windows Version
Username
11/12

Locale
Timezone
SID
List of tasks
List of network adapters
List of files on Desktop

Final Words

Elise is a very advanced piece of malware using for its distribution only the latest exploits.
Before the main payload is executed many different Sandbox evasions are performed. The
payload and the communication code is injected into IExplorer likely bypassing PFW and
HIPS.
