UPDATE 2021-01-26 13:00 UTC: clarified some of the statements about targeted
organizations, as they are only assumptions.
This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that had the SUNBURST
backdoor installed, as well as which of these organizations have indications of having
proceeded to the second stage of the attack, where further internal compromise might have
taken place.

Summary
The recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyber attack that is one of the most severe in
history.
A supply chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to
potentially 18,000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.
The infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe
the threat actor systems to request instructions.
Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to
determine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor might have explicitly
selected for further activities, where it is possible that further internal compromise took place.
These assumptions are based on historical network data (passive DNS) and the logic within
the malware when handling certain responses.
While this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the
type of organizations that were potentially the real targets of the attack.
Some names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (Cisco GGSG), us.deloitte.co (Deloitte),
nswhealth.net (NSW Ministry of Health in Australia), banccentral.com (service supplier of
IT and security for banks), and many others.
The impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach
will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted
parts of the intelligence community.

Introduction
A supply chain attack leveraged SolarWinds to deliver malicious software updates to their
customers (approximately 18.000 potentially affected customers according to SolarWinds).
The update installed a sophisticated backdoor giving the threat actor the ability to access
selected targets and proceed with further activities inside the compromised organizations.

2/29

It is believed that the attack was carried out by a nation-state actor, likely APT29 a.k.a. Cozy
Bear, i.e. Russian Intelligence.
FireEye and Microsoft initially published reports[1][2] describing some of the inner workings
of the backdoor. A second, more detailed, post was later published by FireEye[15]. The
backdoor is remarkably sophisticated and is worth a long technical description, while only
some of its functionalities and characteristics are described in this article.
Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the backdoor as well as historical network data to
identify patterns revealing possible victims.
Due to the nature of the attack, a large number of organizations around the world have been
affected by the backdoor, while likely only a smaller number were specifically selected and
targeted by the threat actor to conduct additional internal compromise (phase 2).

Technical Background
The threat actor was able to inject a backdoor in the Solarwinds Orion software by modifying
the source code of an existing plugin, which was then signed by Solarwinds and published
as part of an update available on the SolarWinds website. SolarWinds published an
advisory[3] specifying the versions affected.
The malicious update has been available for several months and there are indications of
breaches as early as March 2020. One of the identified malicious updates was hosted at the
following URL:
hxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220
Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp

The update package was properly digitally-signed, as shown below.

3/29

Figure 1 - Malicious

The backdoor code was made part of the following digitally-signed Orion component:
SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll

This DLL is also signed.

4/29

Figure 2 - Malicious

Solarwinds Orion DLL containing SUNBURST backdoor
The backdoor implements sophisticated functionality to communicate with the threat actor
infrastructure and applies logic to determine what actions should be taken.
As a large number of Orion servers around the world have been infected with the backdoor,
the threat actor had to have a way to determine which organization was contacting the attack
infrastructure to be able to select the real target of this attack. This logic is partially explained
below. For details see the FireEye article [15].
The hacked servers that received the Solarwinds backdoor periodically probe the threat actor
infrastructure with a DNS query like the following:
<DGA_value>.appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com

5/29

where <DGA_value> is computed with a DomainName Generation Algorithm and contains
an encoded version of the internal Active Directory name of the infected server. The threat
actor server decodes the information in the DNS requests and uses the internal domain
name of the organization to determine what instructions to send back.
Truesec reversed the backdoor and identified a set of IP address ranges that, when received
as part of the DNS response, will determine the actions taken by the backdoor code. Part of
this code is illustrated in the figure below.

Figure 3 – Reversed SUNBURST backdoor showing IP ranges used to determine next
actions
The AddressFamily field determines what the backdoor should do next, which can be
roughly summarized as follows:
Atm or ImpLink : Terminate (killswitch).
Ipx : Go to initial state and keep polling.
NetBios: Start or continue second stage. Can initialize an HTTP backdoor channel used to
collect additional information and deploy a second stage malware (specified by the threat
actor at the time of instructions, and therefore specific to the target).

6/29

We can therefore assume that if the initial probe was answered with an address of type
NetBios, the threat actor had configured the backdoor to move to the second stage, which is
where additional malware can be deployed to possibly perform additional internal
compromise.
Given the number of affected organizations, it is still likely that a large number of victims with
indications of stage 2, as described here, were later filtered out by the threat actor (not
deemed worthy of further attack).

Identifying Internal Names of Victims
The DomainName Generation Algorithm described earlier, used to create a DNS query
containing an encoded value of the internal domain name of the compromised organization,
can be reversed.
RedDrip Team published a report[4] and a script[5] to decode the DGA part of the DNS
requests, therefore allowing to retrieve the cleartext value of the internal domain name of the
hacked server that made the request.
For example, if a compromised server makes the following request to the threat actor server:
ciepcqqog816s6urtt6t0kf60ceo6e20.appsync-api.us-east-2.avsvmcloud[.]com

This can be decoded to obtain the following internal name of the victim:
ggsg-us.cisco

This means that having records of performed DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com will reveal
the internal names of the compromised organizations.
The SUNBURST backdoor uses the following three parameters to create a "Host Id" used in
the DNS requests:
MAC address of the network interface
Internal domain name that the machine is joined to
Machine Guid from
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid
Since the DGA values from DNS requests can be decoded, if you have a DNS request and
you want to see if it was generated from a certain machine, you only need to know MAC
address, internal domain name, and machine Guid.
This can be extremely helpful during investigations to determine if a machine had a
communicating SUNBURST backdoor on it. We wrote a PowerShell script that can be used
for this, based on the great work by Erik Hjelmvik, Netresec.

7/29

Identifying Threat Actor Instructions
The next step was to obtain historical records of DNS requests, including the response.
We obtained some of the available historical data[6].
The sample data contains 1528 DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com and their responses.
When filtered for requests matching the DGA algorithm syntax, we have requests with dates
ranging from early April to December 2020.
This is an example of such request and response:
date : 2020-04-19 08:24:26
last_seen : 2020-04-19 08:24:27
qtype : 1
domain : avsvmcloud.com
qname : q8bps26mocuq6re4dutru70ct2w.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud.com
value_ip : 8.18.144.138
type : ip
_key : 0e8ab64d5f5aff04fea862f4f72fcf1d04c3d377
value : 8.18.144.138

From this data we can determine that on April 19th, a request was made that decodes to the
internal name pageaz.gov, and received as response 8.18.144.138, which according to the
backdoor logic explained earlier maps to address type NetBios, meaning that the threat
actor might have deployed an HTTP backdoor in this environment.

Command and Control Infrastructure
By analyzing the IP addresses returned when instructing infected servers to establish an
HTTP backdoor, we can identify the following blocks.
IP block

Registered Organization (WHOIS information)

184.72.0.0 / 255.254.0.0

Amazon.com, Inc.

71.152.53.0 / 255.255.255.0

Amazon.com, Inc.

8.18.144.0 / 255.255.254.0

Amazon Inc.

87.238.80.0 / 255.255.248.0

Amazon Data Services Ireland DUB3 Datacentre

18.130.0.0 / 255.255.0.0

Amazon Technologies Inc.

99.79.0.0 / 255.255.0.0

Amazon Data Services Canada

199.201.117.0 / 255.255.255.0

Traiana, Inc

8/29

Table 1 – List of IP blocks used when instructing systems to establish an HTTP backdoor,
mapped to WHOIS information
These IP blocks are not used to establish the HTTP connection. Instead, if a CNAME record
is contained in the response, that is the address used as C2 address for the new HTTP
channel. FireEye listed the CNAME responses that they have observed as part of their
indicators of compromise[9]. These are also reported below for convenience:
freescanonline[.]com
deftsecurity[.]com
freescanonline[.]com
thedoccloud[.]com

We initially thought that the A records in the blocks above were the C2 addresses, which
would also make sense as almost all are part of the Amazon infrastructure and threat actors
often use cloud providers to host their attack infrastructure. This would have also meant that
the block belonging to Traiana, Inc could potentially be under the control of the threat actor.
Truesec Threat Intelligence observed a large number of DNS responses from the threat actor
server providing different IP addresses in the range 199.201.117.0/24 for the next stage.
At this point in time, it does not seem that these IP blocks were under the control of the
threat actor, but were instead deliberately used as part of the logic within the backdoor.

Putting the Pieces Together
We have decoded the DGA parts of the requests to identify internal domain names of
compromised organizations, correlated that with the responses received from the threat actor
server, and mapped them with the hardcoded list of IP ranges in the backdoor code.
This gives us a (partial) list of breached organizations, and which ones had the SUNBURST
backdoor configured for the second stage of the attack where further internal compromise
might have taken place.
Note that some of the names are truncated. Further analysis is ongoing to determine if this
can be improved.
The results are summarized at the bottom of this post. This list contains the decoded values
of internal domain names. We can therefore only assume that they belong to an
organization based on the name of the domains and publicly available information.
Some of the internal names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (Cisco GGSG), us.deloitte.co
(Deloitte), nswhealth.net (NSW Ministry of Health in Australia), banccentral.com (service
supplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.

Disabling Security Services and Avoiding Detection
9/29

The backdoor keeps an eye on a number of processes, services, and device drivers. It
simply avoids running if any of the following 137 processes are detected on the system.

The second check is a list of 8 services matched by process names. The backdoor searches
for the services and keeps track of the status of the services. Additionally, it changes the
security descriptor of the service registry key and the start parameter. The service is never
stopped by the backdoor and it looks like it simply waits until the machine restarts for the
service to change state. The state of the services is recorded and stored in the DLL config
file using the parameter RetryWatcherPostpone
The list of services is the following:
msmpeng
mssense
cavp
cb
csfalconservice
csfalconcontainer
xagt
xagtnotif
ekrn
eguiproxy
egui
fsgk32st
fswebuid
fsgk32
fsma32
fssm32
fnrb32
fsaua
fsorsp
fsav32

13/29

The backdoor avoids tampering with the start parameter of the WinDefend service and
only changes the service key security descriptor.
The third check is performed to detect 17 specific device drivers. This check behaves the
same way as the check for processes and will make sure that the backdoor aborts if any of
the following drivers are detected.
cybkerneltracker.sys
atrsdfw.sys
eaw.sys
rvsavd.sys
dgdmk.sys
sentinelmonitor.sys
hexisfsmonitor.sys
groundling32.sys
groundling64.sys
safe-agent.sys
crexecprev.sys
psepfilter.sys
cve.sys
brfilter.sys
brcow_x_x_x_x.sys
lragentmf.sys
libwamf.sys

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the detection of any of the specified processes
or device drivers will always alter the execution path of the backdoor and discontinue the
execution. While the detection of the listed services will only alter the execution path if a
change in the status was detected.
Note that for services running as protected services, changing the service registry start
parameter is not possible while the service is running. This applies to services related to any
antimalware with ELAM capabilities like the Windows Defender.
The Backdoor does not try to avoid the listed antivirus, antimalware, and EDR service. For
unknown reasons, it tries to keep track of the status of these services.

Impact of the Attack
The target organizations, the threat actor sophistication, and the amount of time between the
initial breach and the discovery strongly indicates an impact of gigantic proportions.
It is highly likely that a massive amount of highly confidential information belonging to
government organizations, medical institutions, cybersecurity, the financial industry, etc. has
been leaked. It is also highly likely that software and systems have been compromised and
that the modus operandi of the SolarWinds breach can be repeated in future campaigns.

14/29

More information will be disclosed during the upcoming months but the full extent of this
breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to
trusted parts of the intelligence community.
