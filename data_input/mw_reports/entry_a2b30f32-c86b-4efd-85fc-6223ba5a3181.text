Current Events to Widespread Campaigns: Pivoting from
Samples to Identify Activity
domaintools.com/resources/blog/current-events-to-widespread-campaigns-pivoting-from-samples-to-identify

We would like to thank Black Lotus Labs at Lumen for their contributions and
assistance in this analysis.
If you would prefer to listen to The DomainTools Research team discuss their
analysis, it is featured in our recent episode of Breaking Badness, which is included at
the bottom of this post.

Introduction
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) practitioners can gain insight into adversary operations by
tracking conflicts or geopolitical tensions. Similar to a “follow the money” approach in
criminal investigations, looking at conflict zones can reveal cyber capabilities deployed as
part of events —either by the parties to the conflict itself, or third parties interested in
monitoring events for their own purposes.
The above theory is supported by historical incidents linked to geopolitical tensions:
Russia’s invasion of Ukrainian territory leading to, among other events, the 2015 and
2016 Ukraine power incidents, the 2017 NotPetya event, and continuing operations to
the present.
Tensions in the Arabian/Persian Gulf region leading to multiple rounds of wiper
malware as well as providing possible “cover” for the 2017 Triton/TRISIS incident.
Continuing strains on the Korean peninsula providing cover for the 2018 disruptive
attack on the Pyeongchang Olympic Games (even if the attacker in this case was not
North Korea).
Based on precedent, analysts can identify developments in adversary operations and
technical capabilities by tracking identifiers related to major events and conflict zones.
Identifying capabilities deployed to take advantage of such items can yield insights into
fundamental attacker tradecraft and behaviors, and enable defense and response for
incidents which may strike far closer to home at a later date.

Initial Discovery: Caucasus Conflict

1/16

With the above thesis in mind, DomainTools researchers examined technical artifacts
emerging around the 2020 conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus
region. While investigating, researchers discovered the following malicious document file on
a commercial multi-scanner service:
Name: PKK militants in Nagorno-Karabakh.doc
MD5: e00af9b6303460666ae1b4bdeb9503ba
SHA1: ce810173555d6a98ce10c847f16e95575fe13405
SHA256: 7c495c21c628d37ba2298e4a789ff677867521be27ec14d2cd9e9bf55160518f

Masquerading as a news article covering details about the Caucasus conflict, the document
contains a reference to an external site to fetch additional material to the victim’s computer:

2/16

In this specific case, the document attempts to communicate to the domain
“msofficeupdate[.]org”:

3/16

Overall, the document appears focused on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict with dedicated
network infrastructure enabling the attack sequence. While we could stop and view this item
in isolation, further analysis reveals even more interesting elements.

Identifying Items for Pivoting
Both the document and the domain contain items of interest for further analysis and
pivoting. Reviewing lessons from a previous DomainTools blog, we can examine the
technical indicators related to this campaign as composite objects with opportunities to
discern fundamental adversary behaviors.
Examining the document, file metadata, shown here using Phil Harvey’s ExifTool, indicates
the presence of an unusually long string of numbers as a template object:

4/16

Based on the template object and a hard-coded Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the
document will attempt to communicate to the domain identified above. The actual
functionality of the malicious document hinges on network communication to the attacker
domain, with an HTTP request to a resource such as the following:
hXXps://msofficeupdate[.]org/morgue6visible5bunny6culvert7ambo5nun1illuminate4

All following functionality appears dependent on a response to this request. At this time,
DomainTools does not have any data or other information as to what may be returned from
this response. As a result, our analysis is limited to the document itself and identified
network infrastructure. However, defenders may find value in the URL pattern in the HTTP
request—words divided by single numbers—for developing Network Intrusion Detection
System (NIDS) signatures.

Lack of view into follow-on execution aside, we have a search string to use to fingerprint
additional file samples or to disposition items that may be related to the original campaign in
the template string. Notably, for a malicious document, the item does not contain any active

5/16

content (ActiveX objects or Visual Basic for Applications [VBA] macros), limiting our ability
to identify further items. However, the template item appears unique enough to serve as a
signifier to identify additional samples similarly constructed.
On the infrastructure side, we have several more leads to follow. As previously documented
in past blogs on infrastructure hunting and analysis, we have a combination of technical
indicators related to domain creation and hosting as well as thematic identifiers related to
the domain name itself. For the domain in question, as seen in the previous DomainTools
Iris Investigate inspection image above, the following observations hold:
Leaked registrant email, “g.j.dodson[AT]protonmail[.]com”.
Domain registration service, “PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com”.
Authoritative name server associated with the domain, “bitdomain[.]biz”.
Hosting on a dedicated server, “46.30.188[.]236”, through the Netherlands-based
provider “Web2objects Gmbh”.
An SSL/TLS certificate obtained through Sectigo with limited identifying information.
A domain “theme” of mimicking Microsoft Office update services.
While any of the above items in isolation may be relatively limited for identifying adversary
tendencies or additional infrastructure—either by being too general or far too specific—in
combination, they can yield patterns for further analysis. For example, looking for a
combination of privacy-centric email addresses registering domains via
PublicDomainRegistry using the name server “bitdomain[.]biz” hosted in Europe with
Sectigo SSL/TLS certificates can yield a result set for further analysis. Applying a “thematic”
search to the results of such an investigation, such as looking for other Microsoft or Office
themes in domain names, can identify additional items for analysis related to this campaign.

Unraveling Additional Infrastructure
Based on the characteristics described in the previous section, DomainTools researchers
identified 35 domains matching the patterns associated with the initially observed malicious
domain at varying levels of estimative probability or confidence. As shown in the following
table, we can observe additional tendencies such as favoring several privacy-oriented email
services during registration and an overwhelming focus on European Virtual Private Server
(VPS) providers for hosting purposes.

While the majority of items were created in 2020, some potentially related network
observables date as far back as 2016. When matched against malicious document samples
examined in the following section, we begin to see the outlines of a persistent, somewhat
lengthy campaign. Although extended in time, the same fundamental network behaviors are
reflected in observed items throughout this period.
Observed visually, such as in the DomainTools Iris Investigate visualization below, we see
clusters of activity divided between name servers, registrars, and Top Level Domains
(TLDs). With an even larger population, we could begin to distill even more aspects of this
adversary’s methods of operation and potentially devise predictive algorithms for future
infrastructure creation.

9/16

Locating Additional Samples
In addition to identifying additional network infrastructure, a combination of reviewing the
original document as well as pivoting off of observed network infrastructure yields additional
malicious document samples. Primarily, the unique Template string of numbers combined
with relationship to domains and document themes enable the discovery of additional items.
As shown in the following table, these items are linked through both the unique Template
string as well as contacting infrastructure related to the analysis provided above on network
observables.

As described in greater detail in the following section, these items largely feature themes
related to conflict in the Caucasus or continuing conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, they extend
from December 2019 through November 2020, indicating this activity has continued without
significant change for nearly a year.
In addition to these items, DomainTools researchers also identified a second set of
documents, all originating from France, with a “testing” theme but matching various
characteristics of the above items, such as the unique Template string:

The items above stand out from the other documents for several reasons:
All were submitted to the same multiscanner service on the same day.
The items appear to be iterative given the file naming schema (testmw2, testmw3,
etc.).
Analysis of the files indicates fuzzing or alteration of capability among them, in line
with the iterative nature of the file names.
An initial conclusion would be these are “testing” runs for a malicious document format or
template which would emerge in later campaigns. However, the timing is off for this
conclusion to hold as the “test” items appear in mid-September when items using the same
template (functionality and lure document) first appear in December 2019.
Overall, this batch of items remains somewhat a mystery as there are no obvious signs
linking it to other campaigns. Additionally, some of the items in question are non-functional
or lack other components linked to the activity in the first set of documents associated with
a likely persistent campaign. DomainTools does not possess any additional information to
disposition these items at this time, so they remain somewhat of a mystery relative to the
other malicious documents which appear more clearly designed for espionage purposes.

Motivations and Attribution
The identified documents emerge from multiple locations but overwhelmingly focus on
Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

13/16

More interesting still are the themes associated with the documents in their text and titles. In
addition to the document which sparked this investigation and its themes centering on the
recent conflict on the Caucasus, identified topics include the following:
C. Bayramov.doc: references the Azerbaijani foreign minister, Ceyhun Bayramov.
Фадеев M1.doc: presents itself as a fundraising advertisement for a documentary
filmmaker covering events in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, an area of conflict.
О поставке зенитных ракетных систем С-400.doc: masquerades as a report on the
S-400 air defense system, produced by Russia and sold to multiple countries.
Планируемые расходы 2020(1).doc: “Planned Expenses 2020”, a document that
appears to show personnel expenses for a Ukrainian local government entity.
Strategic Defence and Security Review (2021 SDSR).doc: a strategic defense
planning document intended for the Slovenian defense ministry. Notably, this
document appears related to a phishing email sent to an individual who appears to be
the Slovenian military attache to the country’s embassy in the Russian Federation.
Справочник АП_26.10.2020_.doc: a planning document from the Russian-backed but
unrecognized breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic.
Новые поправки к Госпрограмме переселения в РФ (вст. в силу 01.07.2020).doc: a
document on internal resettlement within the Russian Federation.
Минтруд госслужба.doc:a document from the Russian-backed but unrecognized
breakaway Luhansk People’s Republic.

14/16

Overall, documents appear related to political, military, and related subjects largely in
conflict zones such as the Caucasus and the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern
Ukraine. Additional items, such as the Slovenian defense document which DomainTools
researchers were able to link to a phishing email, strongly imply state-sponsored interests
for espionage or similar purposes as motivating this campaign.

In October 2020, several researchers noticed some of the documents identified in this
report and linked it to a group referred to in public reporting as “Cloud Atlas” or “Inception.”
While data available at present does not completely align with prior Cloud Atlas activity, the
following commonalities are observed:
Targeting focusing on Russian near-abroad regions.
Use of template objects for initial activity through malicious documents.
Likely reliance on network communication to retrieve second-stage tooling for followon activity.
The response to the HTTP requests sent by the documents would presumably be the key
for aligning the above campaigns to the Cloud Atlas actor, but absent this evidence
DomainTools can neither confirm nor deny association to this group at present.
Irrespective of specific attribution, possible links to a known Advanced Persistent Threat
(APT) actor (Cloud Atlas) combined with campaign themes that are highly political in nature
with no obvious mechanism for monetization make the discovered campaign a likely statesponsored or state-directed espionage campaign. While targeting in this case may imply
Russian-related interests, it is important to note that earlier Cloud Atlas activity has also
targeted entities in the Russian Federation. One possible alternative hypothesis given the
targeting in Russia, as well as a focus on breakaway regions in Ukraine, is that the activity
represents Ukraine-sponsored cyber espionage activity. Although interesting, again
insufficient evidence exists to support this hypothesis at this time.

15/16

While the activity described above is certainly concerning, available information at this time
does not support even weak attribution to any state interest, with only plausible (but as yet
unproven) links to the Cloud Atlas entity. Although specific attribution may not be possible,
we can nonetheless conclude with high confidence that this activity represents cyber
espionage activity directed by some, as yet unknown, state actor.

Conclusion
Tracking themes related to geopolitical events can be quite fruitful for discovering active
campaigns likely related to state-sponsored interests. In the above example, searching for
items related to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict in the Caucasus in late 2020 yielded a
malicious document. Further analysis of this document and related infrastructure then led to
the discovery of additional items which outlined an entire campaign stretching back to 2019.
While the victims of this campaign appear geographically limited, largely focusing on
Ukraine and Azerbaijan, the lessons drawn from the analysis of both the malicious
documents and related network infrastructure can be used to further defense against similar
types of attacks. By monitoring for these types of event-specific incidents, CTI analysts can
gain insight into emerging APT activity and deploy defensive countermeasures shortly after
discovery.
