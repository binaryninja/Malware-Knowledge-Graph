Evolution of sophisticated spyware: from Agent.BTZ to ComRAT
In November 2014, the experts of the G DATA SecurityLabs published an article about
ComRAT, the Agent.BTZ successor. We explained that this case is linked to the Uroburos
rootkit. We assume that the actor behind these campaigns uses several different malware
strains is order to compromise the targeted infrastructure: Uroburos, a rootkit;
Agent.BTZ/ComRAT, remote administration tools or Linux malware and maybe even more.
We decided to have an even closer look at Agent.BTZ and ComRAT and therefore analyzed the evolution
of this RAT, covering seven years of development. Here is a table with the minimal information about 46
different samples:

Thanks to the versioning, we can deduce that the compilation dates we saw and currently see actually
seem to be legit – except for the last known version, in which the author modified the compilation date in
order to make the analysis more complex. We can see that this malware was really active in 2007 and
2008. New versions declined in frequency in 2009 and only one new sample was identified in 2010. We
did not encounter any new sample from 2011, but the malware appeared back in 2012, with a new major
version.

The RAT’s evolution described in ten steps
To describe the evolution of the development, we decided to compare ten major versions:
Version Ch 1.0 (2007-06) to Ch 1.5 (2008-03)
Version Ch 1.5 (2008-03) to Ch 2.03 (2008-05)
Version Ch 2.03 (2008-05) to Ch 2.11 (2009-09)
Version Ch 2.11 (2009-09) to Ch 2.14.1 (2010-02)
Version Ch 2.14.1 (2010-02) to Ch 3.00 (2012-01)
Version Ch 3.00 (2012-01) to Ch 3.10 (2012-12)
Version Ch 3.10 (2012-12) to Ch 3.20 (2013-06)
Version Ch 3.20 (2013-06) to Ch 3.25 (2014-02)
Version Ch 3.25 (2014-02) to Ch 3.26 (2013-01; date has been modified)
The following chapter will present the main differences between the versions mentioned above. Here is
the resemblance ratio for each version, comparing direct neighbor versions only, created using BinDiff:

The biggest code update has occurred between version 2.14.1 and version 3.00. The gap matches the
absence of samples during two years and this fundamental modification is what we call the death of
Agent.BTZ and the birth of ComRAT.

Differences between version Ch 1.0 (2007-06) to Ch 1.5 (2008-03)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 1.0: b41fbdd02e4d54b4bc28eda99a8c1502
Ch 1.5: bbf569176ec7ec611d8a000b50cdb754
Code similarity: 90%
We did not identify strong modification between the two samples. However, we can notice the following:
The configuration file (XML) in version 1.5 is stored in Unicode and not in ASCII anymore;
The two versions implement a mechanism to infect new media connected to the infected system.
The implementation is not exactly the same nor is the log of media infection;
Version 1.5 creates a new event: “wowmgr_is_load”. This event has then been used for years.

Differences between version Ch 1.5 (2008-03) and Ch 2.03 (2008-05)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 1.5: bbf569176ec7ec611d8a000b50cdb754
Ch 2.03: 78d3f074b70788897ae7e20e5137bf47
Code similarity: 83%
In version 2.03 of Agent.BTZ, the authors changed the following:

They added obfuscation in order to hide sensitive strings;
The communication protocol was modified in order to include the flag “<CHCMD>”
we assume that “CH” has the same meaning than “Ch” before the version number and “CMD” is the
abbreviation for command;
From now on, the malware supports “runas” in order to execute commands as administrator. This
command was implemented by Microsoft in Windows Vista in 2007. We assume that the author
implemented this feature because several targets switched to this version of Windows in 2008.
According to an article, version 1.5 was used against the US Pentagon. We assume that the string
obfuscation was performed in order to bypass security measures being capable of detecting an intrusion.

Differences between version Ch 2.03 (2008-05) and Ch 2.11 (2009-09)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 2.03: 78d3f074b70788897ae7e20e5137bf47
Ch 2.11: 162f415abad9708aa61db8e03bcf2f3c
Code similarity: 96%
The codes of these two versions are extremely similar to each other, we can only notice small changes:
The author changed the name of several registry keys (probably to avoid detection by well-known
IOC);
The name of two exported functions were modified, too: InstallM() becomes AddAtomT() and
InstallS() becomes AddAtomS(),probably for the same reason than above.

Differences between version Ch 2.11 (2009-09) and Ch 2.14.1 (2010-02)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 2.11: 162f415abad9708aa61db8e03bcf2f3c
Ch 2.14.1: 5121ce1f96d74076df1c39748e019f42
Code similarity: 98%
These codes are really similar to each other, too. We can notice only two changes:
The author patched several bugs;
Four new exports appear: DllCanUnLoadNow(), DllGetClassObject(), DllRegisterServer(),
DllUnregisterServer().
The four exported libraries show that the malware has started to support the OLE Component Object

Model (COM). This version is the first version able to be registered as a COM object. Three of the four
functions are empty. The fourth one executes the malware.

Differences between version 2.14.1 (2010-02) and Ch 3.00 (2012-01)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 2.14.1: 5121ce1f96d74076df1c39748e019f42
Ch 3.00: 28dc1ca683d6a14d0d1794a68c477604
Code similarity: 60%
These codes really differ from each other, even if some parts of version 2.14.1 were retained. Moreover, the
developers changed the compiler; they switched from Visual Studio 6.0 to Visual Studio 9.0/10.0 , which
is a strong indicator for the huge differences.Version 3.00 is what the G DATA SecurityLabs experts call
ComRAT. We can say that version 2.14.1 is the last version of Agent.BTZ. Here are the main differences
between Agent.BTZ and ComRAT:
The new malware collects more information about the infected system (such as drive information,
volume information…).
The media stick infection mechanism has definitely been removed. We assume this happened due to
the fact that Microsoft has disabled AutoRun for external media. For the attackers, this infection
vector is not interesting anymore.
The malware is injected into every process of the infected machine and the main payload is executed
in “explorer.exe” as we explained in our article;
The communication channel to the command and control is not the same anymore. In this new
version, the malware uses POST requests with the following pattern:

As the malware is injected into every process of the infected system, it creates named pipe in order
to handle inter-processes communication.
On several 3.00 samples, the author forgot to remove the compilation path, here are some examples:

c:\projects\ChinckSkx64\Debug\Chinch.pdb
c:\projects\ChinckSkx64\Release\libadcodec.pdb
C:\projects\ChinckSkx64\x64\Release\libadcodec.pdb
E:\old_comp\_Chinch\Chinch\trunk\Debug\Chinch.pdb
c:\projects\ChinchSk\Release\libadcodec.pdb
Thanks to these compilation paths, we assume that the original name of the RAT is “Chinch”, which leads
us to the assumption that the “CH” characters in the version name and in the flag “<CHCMD>” stands for
“Chinch”. In English, chinch is the word for a small North American bug, Blissus leucopterus. This word is
derived from the Spanish word chinche, meaning pest.

Differences between version 3.00 (2012-01) and Ch 3.10 (2012-12)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 3.00: 28dc1ca683d6a14d0d1794a68c477604
Ch 3.10: b86137fa5a232c614ec5405be4d13b37
Code similarity: 90%
The codes are similar to each other, but the authors added several features:
The malware generates more logs;
The malware has a Mutex handle;
The 3.10 version supports multiple command and control servers.
The last new feature is really interesting: if the compromised targets block a specific command and control
server, the malware will continue to work, thanks to two alternative command and control servers.

Differences between version 3.10 (2012-12) and Ch 3.20 (2013-06)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 3.10: b86137fa5a232c614ec5405be4d13b37
Ch 3.20: 7872c1d88fe21d8a85f160a6666c76e8
Code similarity: 93%
The major new feature in the version is the new exports function called InstallW(). This exported function
is used by the dropper to add persistence in the registry and to drop a second file (as explained in our
previous article). Version 3.20 uses the following CLSID in order to hijack COM object: B196B286-BAB4101A-B69C-00AA00341D07. This object is the IConnectionPoint interface. The CLSID was only used in
this version. We assume that the performed COM object hijacking generates some trouble on the infected

system, that’s why the author changed related things in the next version. Furthermore, the CLSID was
stored in plain text within the sample.

Differences between version Ch 3.20 (2013-06) and Ch 3.25 (2014-02)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 3.20: 7872c1d88fe21d8a85f160a6666c76e8
Ch 3.25: ec7e3cfaeaac0401316d66e964be684e
Code similarity: 91%
In the 3.25 version, the author switched to the CLSID: 42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1 as
described in our article. Furthermore, the strings in the sample are obfuscated. The main new feature is
the obfuscation – almost all strings are obfuscated and the XML pattern is not written in plain text
anymore.

Differences between version Ch 3.25 (2014-02) and Ch 3.26 (2013-01; date has
been modified)
The analyzed samples are:
Ch 3.25: ec7e3cfaeaac0401316d66e964be684e
Ch 3.26: b407b6e5b4046da226d6e189a67f62ca
Code similarity: 95%
The version 3.26 is the latest known version. In this version:
The authors removed the familiar XOR key used by Agent.BTZ and Uroburos. We assume that due
to the G DATA publication in February 2014, the author decided to remove as many links as possible
between Uroburos and Agent.BTZ/ComRAT/Chinch;
The authors do not generate logs anymore;
The compilation date has been modified, in order to make the analysis and timeline creation more
complex.

Conclusion
This analysis shows us seven years of the evolution of a Remote Administration Tool, used by a group
which targeted extremely sensitive entities, such as the US Pentagon in 2008 or the Belgium Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in 2014 as well as the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Except for version 3.00, the modifications made are rather marginal. We can see that the authors adapted

features to the Windows versions, patched bugs, added obfuscation etc… The biggest update was
performed to version 3.00, after two years of silence. Visibly, this RAT was used alongside the Uroburos
rootkit. Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear how and when the attackers choose to use the RAT or the
rootkit or whether both are used in parallel.
Taking everything into consideration, G DATA SecurityLabs experts are sure that the group behind
Uroburos/Agent.BTZ/ComRAT/Linux tool/… will remain an active player in the malware and APT field.
The newest revelations made and connections drawn let us believe that there is even more to come.
