Windows 10: protection, detection, and response against recent
Depriz malware attacks

December 10, 2016

A few weeks ago, multiple organizations in the Middle East fell victim to targeted and destructive attacks that
wiped data from computers, and in many cases rendering them unstable and unbootable. Destructive attacks like
these have been observed repeatedly over the years and the Windows Defender and Windows Defender
Advanced Threat Protection Threat Intelligence teams are working on protection, detection, and response to
these threats.
Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified similarities between this recent attack and previous 2012 attacks against
tens of thousands of computers belonging to organizations in the energy sector. Microsoft Threat Intelligence
refers to the activity group behind these attacks as TERBIUM, following our internal practice of assigning rogue
actors chemical element names.
Although the extent of damage caused by this latest attack by TERBIUM is still unknown, Windows 10 customers
have a set of features available for them to enable to mitigate such attack. Windows 10 has built-in proactive
security components, such as Device Guard, that mitigate this threat; Windows Defender customers are
protected through multiple signature-based detections; and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
(ATP) customers are provided extensive visibility and detection capabilities across the attack kill chain, enabling
security operation teams to respond quickly. Microsoft’s analysis has shown that the components and techniques
used by TERBIUM in this campaign trigger multiple detections and threat intelligence alerts in Windows Defender
Advanced Threat Protection.
To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced
attacks, sign up for a free trial.

Attack composition
Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed that the malware used by TERBIUM, dubbed “Depriz” by Microsoft,
reuses several components and techniques seen in the 2012 attacks, and has been highly customized for each
targeted organization.
We do not see any indicators that a zero-day exploit is being used by TERBIUM.

Step 1: Writing to disk
The initial infection vector TERBIUM uses is unknown. As credentials have been hard-coded in the malware
TERBIUM uses, it is suspected that TERBIUM has harvested credentials or infiltrated the target organization
previously. Once TERBIUM has a foothold in the organization, its infection chain starts by writing an executable
file to disk that contains all the components required to carry out the data-wiping operation. These components
are encoded in the executables resources as fake bitmap images.

We decoded the components as the following files:
PKCS12 – a destructive disk wiper component
PKCS7 – a communication module
X509 – 64-bit variant of the Trojan/implant

Step 2: Propagation and persistence through the target network
We have seen TERBIUM use hardcoded credentials embedded in the malware to propagate within a local
network. The availability of these credentials to the activity group suggests that the attacks are highly targeted at
specific enterprises.
The propagation and persistence is carried out as follows:
1. First, it tries to start the RemoteRegistry service on the computer it is trying to copy itself to, then uses
RegConnectRegistryW to connect to it.
2. Next, it attempts to disable UAC remote restrictions by setting the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry
key value to “1”.
3. Once this is done, it connects to the target computer and copies itself as %System%\ntssrvr32.exe or
%System%\ntssrvr64.exe before setting either a remote service called “ntssv” or a scheduled task.

Step 3: Wiping the machine
Next, the Trojan installs the wiper component. Note: TERBIUM establishes a foothold throughout the organization
and does not proceed with the destructive wiping operation until a specific date/time: November 17, 2016 at 8:45
p.m.
The wiper component is installed as %System%\<random name>.exe. During our testing, it used the name
“routeman.exe”, but static analysis shows it can use several other names that attempt to imitate file names of
legitimate system tools.
The wiper component also contains encoded files in its resources as fake bitmap images.
The first encoded resource is a legitimate driver called RawDisk from the Eldos Corporation that allows a user
mode component raw disk access. The driver is saved as %System%\drivers\drdisk.sys and installed by creating
a service pointing to it using “sc create” and “sc start”. This behavior can be observed in the process tree
available in the Windows Defender ATP portal. The below alert represents an example of the generic detections
in Windows Defender ATP:

Figure 3. Windows Defender ATP event tree: Depriz Trojan dropping the wiper component (named “routeman” in
this instance), which in turn drops the RawDisk driver “drdisk”
There are two interesting things worth noting about RawDisk:
It requires a valid license key from Eldos Corporation to run. However, the license key included in Depriz is
the same as the one used in the 2012 attacks – and this license key was only valid for a short period in
2012. TERBIUM works around this by changing the system time on targeted computers to a valid period in
2012.
It is the same as the driver used in the 2012 attacks.

The wiper component uses an image file to overwrite files in locations listed in the following:
Master Boot Records (MBR)
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SystemBootDevice
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FirmwareBootDevice
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers
C:\Windows\System32\Config\systemprofile
Typical user folders like “Desktop”, “Downloads”, “Documents”, “Pictures”, “Videos” and “Music”
Microsoft is also aware of a second threat that uses a distinct wiping component. We detect this as
Trojan:Win32/Cadlotcorg.A!dha in Defender and generic detections with Defender ATP. Microsoft is continuing to
monitor for additional information on this threat.

Step 4: Rendering the machine unusable
Finally, the following command is used to reboot the system into the intended unusable state:
shutdown -r -f -t 2
When the computer attempts to restart after shutting down, it is unable to find the operating system because the
MBR was overwritten in step 3. The machine will no longer boot properly.

Mitigation: Multiple layers of protection from Microsoft
Windows 10 protects, detects and responds to this threat. Windows 10 has built-in proactive security
components, such as Device Guard, that mitigate this threat by restricting execution to trusted applications and
kernel drivers.
In addition, Windows Defender detects and remediates all components on endpoints as
Trojan:Win32/Depriz.A!dha, Trojan:Win32/Depriz.B!dha, Trojan:Win32/Depriz.C!dha, and
Trojan:Win32/Depriz.D!dha.
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), our post-breach security service, provides an additional
layer of security to enterprise users. With threat intelligence indicators, generic detections, and machine learning
models, Windows Defender ATP (trial link) provides extensive visibility and detection capabilities across the
attack kill chain of threats like TERBIUM.
