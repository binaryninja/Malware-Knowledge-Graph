Resecurity, a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity company protecting Fortune 500
worldwide, identified a new RAT (Remote Administration Tool) advertised in Dark Web and
Telegram called Escanor. The threat actors offer Android-based and PC-based versions of
RAT, along with HVNC module and exploit builder to weaponize Microsoft Office and
Adobe PDF documents to deliver malicious code.
The tool has been released for sale on January 26th this year initially as a compact HVNC
implant allowing to set up a silent remote connection to the victim’s computer, and later
transformed into a full-scale commercial RAT with a rich feature-set. Escanor has built a
credible reputation in Dark Web, and attracted over 28,000 subscribers on the Telegram
channel. In the past, the actor with the exact same moniker released ‘cracked’ versions of
other Dark Web tools, including Venom RAT, and Pandora HVNC which were likely used to
enrich further functionality of Escanor.

The mobile version of Escanor (also known as “Esca RAT”) is actively used by
cybercriminals to attack online-banking customers by interception of OTP codes. The tool
can be used to collect GPS coordinates of the victim, monitor keystrokes, activate hidden
cameras, and browse files on the remote mobile devices to steal data.

“Fraudsters monitor the location of the victim, and leverage Esca RAT to steal credentials
to online-banking platforms and perform unauthorized access to compromised account
from the same device and IP – in such case fraud prevention teams are not able to detect
it and react timely” – said Ali Saifeldin, a malware analyst with Resecurity, Inc. who
investigated several recent online-banking theft cases.
Most samples detected recently were delivered using Escanor Exploit Builder. The actors
are using decoy documents imitating invoices and notifications from popular onlineservices.

Notably, the domain name 'escanor[.]live' has been previously identified in connection to
AridViper (APT-C-23 / GnatSpy) infrastructure. APT-C-23 as a group was active within the
Middle Eastern region, known to particularly target Israeli military assets. After the report
was released by Qihoo 360, the Escanor RAT actor released a video detailing how the tool
should be used to bypass AV detection.

3/5

The majority of victims infected by Escanor have been identified in the U.S., Canada, UAE,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Mexico, and Singapore with some infections
in South-East Asia.
