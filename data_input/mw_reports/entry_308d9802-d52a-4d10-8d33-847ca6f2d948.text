A federal grand jury returned an indictment unsealed today in Newark, New Jersey charging
Faramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, both of Iran, in a
34-month-long international computer hacking and extortion scheme involving the
deployment of sophisticated ransomware, announced Deputy Attorney General Rod J.
Rosenstein, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s
Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito for the District of New Jersey and Executive
Assistant Director Amy S. Hess of the FBI.
The six-count indictment alleges that Savandi and Mansouri, acting from inside Iran,
authored malware, known as “SamSam Ransomware,” capable of forcibly encrypting data on
the computers of victims. According to the indictment, beginning in December 2015,
Savandi and Mansouri would then allegedly access the computers of victim entities without
authorization through security vulnerabilities, and install and execute the SamSam
Ransomware on the computers, resulting in the encryption of data on the victims’
computers. These more than 200 victims included hospitals, municipalities, and public
institutions, according to the indictment, including the City of Atlanta, Georgia; the City of
Newark, New Jersey; the Port of San Diego, California; the Colorado Department of
1/4

Transportation; the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta, Canada; and six health carerelated entities: Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, California; Kansas
Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas; Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, more
commonly known as LabCorp, headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina; MedStar Health,
headquartered in Columbia, Maryland; Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital now known as
OrthoNebraska Hospital, in Omaha, Nebraska and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.,
headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
According to the indictment, Savandi and Mansouri would then extort victim entities by
demanding a ransom paid in the virtual currency Bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys for
the encrypted data, collecting ransom payments from victim entities that paid the ransom,
and exchanging the Bitcoin proceeds into Iranian rial using Iran-based Bitcoin exchangers.
The indictment alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Savandi and Mansouri have
collected over $6 million USD in ransom payments to date, and caused over $30 million USD
in losses to victims.
“The Iranian defendants allegedly used hacking and malware to cause more than $30 million
in losses to more than 200 victims,” said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. “According to
the indictment, the hackers infiltrated computer systems in 10 states and Canada and then
demanded payment. The criminal activity harmed state agencies, city governments,
hospitals, and countless innocent victims.”
“The allegations in the indictment unsealed today—the first of its kind—outline an Iran-based
international computer hacking and extortion scheme that engaged in 21st-century digital
blackmail,” said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. “These defendants allegedly used
ransomware to infect the computer networks of municipalities, hospitals, and other key public
institutions, locking out the computer owners, and then demanded millions of dollars in
payments from them. As today’s charges demonstrate, the Criminal Division and its law
enforcement partners will relentlessly pursue cybercriminals who harm American citizens,
businesses, and institutions, regardless of where those criminals may reside.”
“The defendants in this case developed and deployed the SamSam Ransomware in order to
hold public and private entities hostage and then extort money from them,” said U.S.
Attorney Carpenito. “As the indictment in this case details, they started with a business in
Mercer County and then moved on to major public entities, like the City of Newark, and
healthcare providers, like the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles and the
Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita—cravenly taking advantage of the fact that these victims
depend on their computer networks to serve the public, the sick, and the injured without
interruption. The charges announced today show that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
District of New Jersey will continue to act to disrupt such criminal acts, and identify those
who are responsible for them, no matter where in the world they may seek to hide.”

“This indictment demonstrates the FBI’s continuous commitment to unmasking malicious
actors behind the world’s most egregious cyberattacks,” said Executive Assistant Director
Hess. “By calling out those who threaten American systems, we expose criminals who hide
behind their computer and launch attacks that threaten our public safety and national
security. The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cyber criminal
activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety
institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities. The FBI, with the
assistance of our private sector and U.S. government partners, are sending a strong
message that we will work together to investigate and hold all criminals accountable.”
Savandi and Mansouri are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one
count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, two
substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer and two substantive
counts of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer.
According to the indictment, Savandi and Mansouri created the first version of the SamSam
Ransomware in December 2015, and created further refined versions in June and October
2017. In addition to employing Iran-based Bitcoin exchangers, the indictment alleges that
the defendants also utilized overseas computer infrastructure to commit their attacks.
Savandi and Mansouri would also use sophisticated online reconnaissance techniques (such
as scanning for computer network vulnerabilities) and conduct online research in order to
select and target potential victims, according to the indictment. According to the indictment,
the defendants would also disguise their attacks to appear like legitimate network activity.
To carry out their scheme, the indictment alleges that the defendants also employed the use
of Tor, a computer network designed to facilitate anonymous communication over the
internet. According to the indictment, the defendants maximized the damage caused to
victims by launching attacks outside regular business hours, when a victim would find it more
difficult to mitigate the attack, and by encrypting backups of the victims’ computers. This was
intended to—and often did—cripple the regular business operations of the victims, according
to the indictment. The most recent ransomware attack against a victim alleged in the
indictment took place on Sept. 25, 2018.
This case was investigated by the FBI’s Newark Field Office. Senior Counsel William A. Hall
Jr. of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and
Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief of the Cybercrimes Unit Justin S. Herring of the District of
New Jersey are prosecuting the case. The Department thanks its law enforcement
colleagues at the National Crime Agency (UK), West Yorkshire Police (UK), Calgary Police
Service (Canada), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Significant assistance was
provided by the Justice Department’s National Security Division and the Criminal Division’s
Office of International Affairs.

Victims are encouraged to contact their local FBI field office and file a complaint online with
the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The IC3 staff reviews complaints, looking for
patterns or other indicators of significant criminal activity, and refers investigative packages
of complaints to the appropriate law enforcement authorities in a particular city or region. The
FBI provides a variety of resources relating to ransomware through the IC3, which can be
reached at www.ic3.gov. For more information on ransomware prevention, visit:

Charges contained in an indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are
presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
