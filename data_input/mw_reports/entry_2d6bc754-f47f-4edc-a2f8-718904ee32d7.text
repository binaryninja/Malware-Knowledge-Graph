Threats SecureX Threat Advisory
Cisco is deeply concerned by an increase in the rate of high-sophistication attacks on
network infrastructure — that we have observed and have seen corroborated by numerous
reports issued by various intelligence organizations — indicating state-sponsored actors are
targeting routers and firewalls globally. We have spoken about infrastructure security for a
long time. However, while working with network infrastructure in various parts of the world,
we have observed both espionage and obvious targeting to support future destructive
attacks. While working with our partners, we have experienced the operational barriers that
slow and sometimes stop security teams from properly securing network infrastructure. In

1/6

this report, we are sharing both our observations of top-tier attackers and their activities on
network devices, and recommendations and resources to help you improve your network
infrastructure resilience.

Background
Recently, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) released a report on a sustained
campaign by a Russian intelligence agency targeting a vulnerability in routers that Cisco
had published a patch for in 2017. This campaign, dubbed "Jaguar Tooth," is an example of
a much broader trend of sophisticated adversaries targeting networking infrastructure to
advance espionage objectives or pre-position for future destructive activity. While
infrastructure of all types has been observed under attack, attackers have been particularly
successful in compromising infrastructure with out-of-date software.
Because of the large presence of Cisco network infrastructure around the world, any
sustained attack against network infrastructure would likely target Cisco equipment, but
attacks are by no means limited to Cisco hardware. In reporting on Russian intelligence
contracting documents, samples of which were recently shared with Cisco Talos, it was
shown that any infrastructure brand would be targeted, with one scanning component
targeting almost 20 different router and switch manufacturers (see the image below).
Looking at past research, in 2018 Talos looked into the VPNFilter threat, also believed to be
of Russian origin, which showed a well-developed capability targeting Asus, Huawei,
Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, QNAP, TP-LINK, Ubiquiti, and Upvel devices.

Russia is not alone in its actions. CISA has reported on Chinese adversaries targeting
network equipment from a similarly broad set of manufacturers. These are certainly not the
only campaigns targeting network equipment, nor the only actors. It is reasonable to
conclude that any sufficiently capable national intelligence operation would develop and use
the capability to compromise the communications infrastructure of their preferred targets.
Talos investigations are consistent with these findings. We have observed traffic
manipulation, traffic copying, hidden configurations, router malware, infrastructure
reconnaissance and active weakening of defenses by adversaries operating on networking
equipment. Given the variety of activities we have seen adversaries engage in, they have
shown a very high level of comfort and expertise working within the confines of
compromised networking equipment.

2/6

Our assessment is clear, that national intelligence agencies and state-sponsored actors
across the globe have attacked network infrastructure as a target of primary preference.
Route/switch devices are stable, infrequently examined from a security perspective, are
often poorly patched and provide deep network visibility. They are the perfect target for an
adversary looking to be both quiet and have access to important intelligence capability as
well as a foothold in a preferred network.

Campaign observations
We’d like to share a non-exhaustive list of the sorts of activities we have observed actors
take on various infrastructure devices. Our analysis for this set of actors is that they were
(depending on the incident) either engaging in espionage or establishing a foothold for
follow-on actions in support of any number of strategic goals, which may include destructive
attacks. While these activities span several different incidents and campaigns, they
demonstrate the technical capability of the actor. So, in brief, we have seen the following
actor behaviors across different infrastructure platforms at critical infrastructure facilities:
The creation of Generic Router Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels and the hijacking of
DNS traffic, giving the actor the ability to observe and control DNS resolution
Modifying memory to reintroduce vulnerabilities that had been patched so the actor
has a secondary path to access
Modification of configurations to move the compromised device into a compromised
state to allow the actor to execute additional exploits to further access
Installation of malicious software into an infrastructure device that provides additional
capabilities to the actor, including:
Masking of certain configurations so that they can’t be shown by normal
commands
Bypassing of ACLs so that traffic can’t be blocked properly by the router
Allowing for authenticated access to devices outside of the normal SSH/Telnet
methods
Modular design allowing for easy updating as new capabilities are needed or
developed
Capability to corrupt and disable the infrastructure device
Redirection of actor-defined traffic to actor-controlled infrastructure
Creation of hub-and-spoke VPNs designed to allow the siphoning of targeted traffic
from network segments of interest through the VPN
The capture of network traffic for future retrieval, frequently limited to specific IPs or
protocols
A variety of logic to allow network packets to enable and disable certain capabilities
The use of infrastructure devices to deliver attacks or maintain C2 in various
campaigns

3/6

Additionally, we have seen traditional enterprise attacks explicitly targeting the
environments that support infrastructure devices such as TACACS+ servers, enterprise
management servers and jump hosts. Further, we have seen espionage activity on
enterprise networks specifically searching for network data such as credentials, network
diagrams, contracts with network customers and configuration information.
In short, there are extremely sophisticated actors who are increasingly targeting network
infrastructure devices from a variety of manufacturers. We are concerned that insufficient
awareness and patching, the reliance on end-of-life equipment and the necessity for
always-on connectivity makes too many infrastructure devices easy prey. The results of
these issues range from being an unwitting participant in criminal activity to events of true
national security impact.

Guard the creds
The Jaguar Tooth attacks are actually a sequence of attacks, the first looks for poorly
selected SNMP community strings. Once a community string is found, the attacker exploits
CVE-2017-6742, which was first announced on June 29, 2017, after which a software patch
was made available to all customers. But even unpatched, a well-selected SNMP
community string stops this attack in its tracks. It should also be noted that if you are not
using SNMP v3, even well-chosen credentials are transmitted in the clear, and are subject
to capture. NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) and RESTCONF are modern
network management protocols designed to offer better security and functionality than their
older counterpart, SNMP. NETCONF typically runs over SSH, while RESTCONF runs over
HTTPS. Both SSH and HTTPS provide strong encryption and secure authentication
mechanisms, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data being
exchanged. SNMP, particularly its older versions (v1 and v2c), lacks proper encryption and
authentication, which makes it more vulnerable to cyber attacks.
In other incidents, we have observed well-positioned adversaries with preexisting access to
internal environments targeting TACACS+/RADIUS servers to obtain credentials. This gives
them the benefit of understanding the controls enforced by the credential server, as well as
allowing their traffic to look “normal” by using jump servers and employing other techniques
that a typical network administrator would use.
Many of the exploits we’ve seen used in the wild are post-compromise exploits, meaning
the attacker had some form of credential to get them to the place where they could then
launch the exploit and get deeper access to the device. Our recommendations are to select
complex passwords and community strings, to utilize multifactor authentication where
possible, to require encryption when configuring and monitoring devices and to lockdown
and aggressively monitor credential systems like TACACS+ and any jump hosts.

Stay modern, stay real
4/6

Network infrastructure is built to last, and in today’s always-on world, it’s sometimes
impossible to find a patch window. But recent reports – and our own investigations – show
that it is critical to update both the hardware and the software that runs your network. This is
true not just because patching eliminates known vulnerabilities, but upgrades also introduce
new security capabilities and controls that weren’t previously available.
Cisco has introduced a number of technologies and protocols over time that has improved
the security of its products. Some of these advances can be obtained by software upgrade,
while others require more modern networking equipment. For example, in order to combat
certain supply chain attacks, Cisco has introduced a series of technologies. These
technologies include hardware improvements such as the Trust Anchor Module and
software changes like Secure Boot. Organizations that fail to update their hardware and
software will both be more likely to be a victim of unpatched security vulnerabilities but also
will have fewer tools to combat adversaries. Cisco customers can check their version of
software to see if any known vulnerabilities exist in it here. You can learn more about Cisco
Trustworthy Technologies here. Several related resources, tools, and services can be found
at The Trust Center here.

Know your world and enforce it
An organization that both understands the configurations that it is running and monitors for
departures from that understanding have a high probability of discovering adversaries early
in the campaign. For example, an unauthorized GRE tunnel or static VPN, discovered by
NetFlow analysis, would be grounds for an investigation. Additionally, monitoring for
connections to edge routers from unknown external IPs would also uncover some of the
activity that we’ve observed. Even basic configuration monitoring and alerting on
modifications would help in many cases.
Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) tools are another area where policy
enforcement can be useful. We’ve seen actors take unusual action on routers that would
show up in AAA logs and ideally could be denied by the correct AAA configuration. One
example would be attempts to suppress logging by issuing “no aaa accounting”
configuration commands. Attempts to disable any feature of AAA should be both logged
and denied by the AAA system.
Asking organizations to monitor their environment for unusual changes in behavior or
configurations is one of the hardest recommendations we are making. It will take a
combination of a well-documented network infrastructure environment, network engineering
and talented security operations to build a monitoring environment tuned to your
implementation. While there are many technologies to support you, the excellence in your
network engineering and security team, and their willingness to collaborate, will be a large
factor in whether or not you are successful.

If you need us, call us
Responding to incidents involving specialized hardware can be challenging. If you suspect
that a Cisco product has been compromised, please reach out to TAC for assistance. If you
suspect there is a vulnerability in a Cisco product, please reach out to PSIRT. You can find
out how to contact TAC for general questions here. To report or obtain support for a
suspected vulnerability, you can contact Cisco’s PSIRT here.

TL; DR recommendations
Select complex passwords and community strings, avoid default credentials
Use multi-factor authentication
Encrypt all monitoring and configuration traffic (SNMPv3, HTTPS, SSH, NETCONF,
RESTCONF)
Lockdown and aggressively monitor credential systems like TACACS+ and any jump
hosts
Do not run end-of-life hardware and software
Maintain current software
Utilize AAA to deny configuration changes of key protections
Monitor syslog and AAA logs for unusual activities
Monitor your environment for unusual changes in behavior or configuration
Contact Cisco TAC or PSIRT if you need assistance with a security incident involving
Cisco products

Conclusion
If your network isn’t secure, then nothing on that network can be properly secured. We
know that there is a myriad of operational realities that make it difficult to maintain a fully
defensible network infrastructure. However, given the risks and outcomes that compromised
network infrastructure bring, these obstacles must be overcome for organizations to truly
secure their environment. Regardless of the context, aging infrastructure is a risk. Relying
on out-of-date gear or utilizing out-of-date protocols and technologies will eventually cost
your organization. Work with your vendor to give yourself the best chance of defending your
environment.
