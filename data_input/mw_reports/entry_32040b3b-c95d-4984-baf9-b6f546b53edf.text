Important Update from Mimecast
mimecast.com/blog/important-update-from-mimecast/

Microsoft recently informed us that a Mimecast-issued certificate provided to certain
customers to authenticate Mimecast Sync and Recover, Continuity Monitor, and IEP
products to Microsoft 365 Exchange Web Services has been compromised by a
sophisticated threat actor.
Approximately 10 percent of our customers use this connection. Of those that do, there are
indications that a low single digit number of our customers’ M365 tenants were targeted. We
have already contacted these customers to remediate the issue.
As a precaution, we are asking the subset of Mimecast customers using this certificatebased connection to immediately delete the existing connection within their M365 tenant and
re-establish a new certificate-based connection using the new certificate we’ve made
available. Taking this action does not impact inbound or outbound mail flow or associated
security scanning.
The security of our customers is always our top priority. We have engaged a third-party
forensics expert to assist in our investigation, and we will work closely with Microsoft and law
enforcement as appropriate.
