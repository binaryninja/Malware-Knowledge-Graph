Remarks:
Polyanin is believed to be in Russia, possibly in Barnaul, and is one of many
Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware affiliates.

Caution:
Yevgyeniy Igoryevich Polyanin is wanted for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks
and money laundering activities. It is alleged that, through the use and deployment of
Sodinokibi and REvil ransomware, Polyanin left electronic notes in the form of a text file on
victims’ computers. The notes included web addresses for the victims to visit and have their
files decrypted. Upon visiting these web addresses, victims were given the ransom amount
demanded and provided a virtual currency address to use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid
the ransom amount, Polyanin provided the decryption key, and the victims then were able to
access their files. If a victim did not pay the ransom, Polyanin typically posted the victims’
exfiltrated data or claimed he sold the exfiltrated data to third parties. Polyanin has been
charged in an indictment filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
3/4

Texas, Dallas, Texas, with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with
computers, substantive counts of intentional damage to protected computers, and conspiracy
to commit money laundering.
