What’s Dead May Never Die: AZORult Infostealer
Decommissioned Again

Bottom Line Up Front
Since mid-February, discussions throughout multiple cybercrime communities have been
noting that the main password stealing features of the AZORult infostealer – one of the most
prevalent stealers currently in use, and the main culprit behind the ongoing campaign – have
been disabled by a recent Google Chrome update. Since AZORult isn’t actively maintained,
many actors are now regarding the stealer as fully decommissioned.

One Chrome Update to Rule Them All
Over the last several days, threat actors in a variety of cybercrime forums have been
spreading obituaries for AZORult – one of the major, most prevalent infostealers in use by
the cybercrime underground. This is not the first time AZORult dies. In late 2018, sales by
the official developer have stopped because the source code became too ubiquitous and
sprang too many offshoots. However, as shown in our latest research, AZORult remained
very active – it’s been seen in recent campaigns and is directly related to over 300,000
infections paddled on the Genesis Store botnet market.
This time, the situation is different – the word around the cybercriminal underground is that
AZORult is not capable of handling features bundled by a recent Google Chrome update.
One of AZORult’s main functions is stealing browser-saved credentials, and threat actors are
claiming that Chrome’s move to hashing locally-saved password in the AES-256 algorithm
thwarts AZORult’s best efforts to steal them.

Top: an obituary to AZORult posted in a closed Russian hacking forum; from Russian: “Azor is finished.
Not only that – all the older cracked versions of different stealers are finished”. Bottom: actors
discussing AZORult’s apparent demise on a different forum. From Russian: “What is the new encryption of
passwords in chrome?”; “aes256”

As can be seen in the excerpt above – noting “all the older cracked versions of different
stealers are finished” – AZORult is not the only stealer that was affected by the update. The
Raccoon stealer, for example, was also affected by the update. However, unlike AZORult,
Raccoon is actively maintained by a centralized management – and as such was able to
adapt the malware to bypass Chrome’s effort to hide important user data. Other users have
noted KPot stealer has also updated its mechanisms to cope with the new update.

AZORult’s apparent demise – for now, at least – can also be tracked in Genesis. Following
the methodology outlined in our latest research, we’re able to notice a turning point in the last
week: for the first time in over a year, Genesis ditched AZORult and went all-in on a
currently-unidentified trojan as the major infection type. This showcases an important
business principle: never have a single point of failure. The fact that Genesis was cultivating
relationships with several malware providers just might have saved their business, as they
were quickly able to fully pivot to a new malware.

AZORult’s decommissioning in late 2018 was meant to leave a vacuum in the cybercrime
financial ecosystem; many new infostealers were publishing themselves as the new
replacement for seemingly-dead malware. Now, with no apparent heir to fix the deep issues
caused by the new Chrome update, it seems that actors – if we’re extrapolating from
Genesis – have actually decided to move on to new stealers. That is, of course, unless an
3/4

actor picks up the AZORult source code and decides to adapt it to the new Chrome policies
independently; a similar approach was taken by actors not long ago, when a new version of
the stealer, coded in C++ opposed to its native Delphi, was found in active campaigns.
One interesting note to track would be AZORult’s non-infostealing features, which might not
be affected by the Chrome update – for example, it’s loader modules allowing spreading of
other malware following an AZORult infection – shouldn’t be thwarted by the change in
Chrome password encryption.
Following our detailed methodologies and targeted Dark Net research, KELA plans to keep
tabs on these changes in order to effectively defend our clients from commodity malware
threats.
