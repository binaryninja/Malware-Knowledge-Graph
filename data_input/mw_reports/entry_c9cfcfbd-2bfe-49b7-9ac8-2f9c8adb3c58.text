January 25, 2017

When a Germany-based industrial conglomerate disclosed in December 2016 that it was
breached early that year, the breach was revealed to be a professionally run industrial
espionage attack. According to the German press, the intruders used the Winnti family of
malware as their main implant, giving them persistent access to the conglomerate’s network
as early as February 2016.
In this blog, we look at the Winnti malware implant as used by two known activity groups
BARIUM and LEAD. We look at how these activity groups introduce the implant to various
targets and techniques used by Microsoft researchers to track the implant.
To show how this breach and similar breaches can be mitigated, we look at how Windows
Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) flags activities associated
with BARIUM, LEAD, and other known activity groups and how it provides extensive threat
intelligence about these groups. We go through the Winnti implant installation process and
explore how Windows Defender ATP can capture such attacker methods and tools and
provide visualized contextual information that can aid in actual attack investigation and
response. We then discuss how centralized response options, provided as enhancements to
Windows Defender ATP with the Windows 10 Creators Update, can be used to quickly stop
threats, including stopping command and control (C&C) communication and preventing
existing implants from installing additional components or from moving laterally to other
computers on the network.

Winnti activity groups: BARIUM and LEAD
Microsoft Threat Intelligence associates Winnti with multiple activity groups—collections of
malware, supporting infrastructure, online personas, victimology, and other attack artifacts
that the Microsoft intelligent security graph uses to categorize and attribute threat activity.
Microsoft labels activity groups using code names derived from elements in the periodic
table. In the case of this malware, the activity groups strongly associated with Winnti are
BARIUM and LEAD. But even though they share the use of Winnti, the BARIUM and LEAD
activity groups are involved in very different intrusion scenarios.
BARIUM begins its attacks by cultivating relationships with potential victims—particularly
those working in Business Development or Human Resources—on various social media
platforms. Once BARIUM has established rapport, they spear-phish the victim using a variety
of unsophisticated malware installation vectors, including malicious shortcut (.lnk) files with
hidden payloads, compiled HTML help (.chm) files, or Microsoft Office documents containing
macros or exploits. Initial intrusion stages feature the Win32/Barlaiy implant—notable for its
use of social network profiles, collaborative document editing sites, and blogs for C&C. Later
stages of the intrusions rely upon Winnti for persistent access. The majority of victims
recorded to date have been in electronic gaming, multimedia, and Internet content industries,
although occasional intrusions against technology companies have occurred.
In contrast, LEAD has established a far greater reputation for industrial espionage. In the
past few years, LEAD’s victims have included:
Multinational, multi-industry companies involved in the manufacture of textiles,
chemicals, and electronics
Pharmaceutical companies
A company in the chemical industry
University faculty specializing in aeronautical engineering and research
A company involved in the design and manufacture of motor vehicles
A cybersecurity company focusing on protecting industrial control systems
During these intrusions, LEAD’s objective was to steal sensitive data, including research
materials, process documents, and project plans. LEAD also steals code-signing certificates
to sign its malware in subsequent attacks.
In most cases, LEAD’s attacks do not feature any advanced exploit techniques. The group
also does not make special effort to cultivate victims prior to an attack. Instead, the group
often simply emails a Winnti installer to potential victims, relying on basic social engineering
tactics to convince recipients to run the attached malware. In some other cases, LEAD gains

access to a target by brute-forcing remote access login credentials, performing SQL
injection, or exploiting unpatched web servers, and then they copy the Winnti installer directly
to compromised machines.

Tracking Winnti
Microsoft Analytics shows that Winnti has been used in intrusions carried out throughout
Asia, Europe, Oceania, the Middle East, and the United States in the last six months (Figure
1). The most recent series of attacks observed was in December 2016.

Although tracking threats like Winnti involves old-fashioned investigative work, Microsoft
Threat Intelligence analysts take advantage of machine learning to work at scale. When
attackers used Winnti to maintain access to web servers, they hid the implant in plain sight
by masquerading it as a trusted, legitimate file. This was the case in two known intrusions in
2015, where attackers named the implant DLL “ASPNET_FILTER.DLL” to disguise it as the
DLL for the ASP.NET ISAPI Filter (Table 1). Although there are obvious differences between
the legitimate file and the malicious one, filtering out the malicious file would involve going
through a data set with noise from millions of possible file names, software publishers, and
certificates. Microsoft researchers used a combination of anomaly detection and supervised
machine learning to reduce the data set and separate meaningful, malware-related
anomalies from benign data.

Dealing with Winnti intrusions
Windows Defender ATP helps network security professionals deal with intrusions from
activity groups like LEAD and BARIUM in several ways. The following examples were
developed using a Winnti installer that was used in attacks in December 2016.

Alerts for breach activity
Microsoft Threat Intelligence continually tracks activity groups such as LEAD and BARIUM
and documents the tactics, techniques, and procedures they employ in their attacks, with a
special focus on the tools and infrastructure they use to facilitate those attacks. Windows
Defender ATP continuously monitors protected systems for such indicators of hostile activity
and alerts security operations center (SOC) personnel to their presence (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Threat intelligence alert in Windows Defender ATP
To provide context around such alerts, Windows Defender ATP also features a short
summary of the group’s history, goals, methods, and tools (Figure 3), with links to extensive
documentation for technically minded users.

Windows Defender ATP is also capable of detecting previously unknown attacks by
monitoring system behavior indicative of hostile activity, including:
Malware installation, persistence, and activation
Backdoor command and control
Credential theft
Lateral movement to other machines on the network
For example, numerous malware families register themselves as services during installation
to guarantee persistence across reboots. A majority of malware that perform this persistence
technique modify the necessary registry keys in ways that do not fit the profile of a legitimate
program. Winnti is no exception, and so, during Winnti’s installation process, Windows
Defender ATP is able to raise behavioral alerts (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Abnormal service creation alert
To improve coverage while minimizing false positives, Windows Defender ATP uses the
intelligent security graph to differentiate between suspicious and benign behavior before
generating alerts. It considers the age of the file, its global prevalence, and the presence and
validity of a digital signature along with the method of service creation.

Visualized contextual information

For alerts raised either by specific threat intelligence tied to activity groups or by more
generic suspicious behaviors, Windows Defender ATP provides rich, visualized technical
context. This visual context enables SOC personnel to investigate alerts with all related
artifacts, understand the scope of the breach, and prepare a comprehensive action plan. In
the screenshots below, Windows Defender ATP clearly presents the Winnti installation where
an installer drops a DLL to disk (Figure 5), loads the DLL using rundll32 (Figure 6), sets the
DLL as a service (Figure 7), and saves a copy of itself in C:\Windows\Help (Figure 8).

Windows Defender ATP displays these activities as process trees in a machine timeline for
the infected computer. Analysts can easily extract detailed information from these trees, such
as the implant DLL dropped by the installer, the command used to call rundll32.exe and load
the DLL, and the registry modifications that set the DLL as a service. This information can
provide an initial means by which to assess the scope of the breach.

Response options
The Windows 10 Creators Update will bring several enhancements to Windows Defender
ATP that will provide SOC personnel with options for immediate mitigation of a detected
threat. If an intruder compromises a computer that has been onboarded to Windows
Defender ATP, SOC personnel can isolate the computer from the network, blocking
command and control of the implant and preventing attackers from installing additional
malware and moving laterally to other computers in the network. Meanwhile, connectivity to
the Windows Defender ATP service is maintained. While the machine is in isolation, SOC
personnel can direct the infected machine to collect live investigation data, such as the DNS
cache or security event logs, which they can use to verify alerts, assess the state of the
intrusion, and support follow-up actions.

Another option is to simply halt and quarantine the Winnti implant itself, stopping the
intrusion on a single machine. LEAD and BARIUM are not known for large-scale spearphishing, so it is unlikely that SOC personnel would have to deal with multiple machines
having been compromised by these groups at the same time. Nevertheless, Windows
Defender ATP also supports blocking the implant across the entire enterprise, stopping
large-scale intrusions in the early stages (Figure 10).

Conclusion: Shorten breach detection times to reduce impact
According to news reports, the incident affecting the industrial conglomerate may have taken
several months to detect and mitigate. The time between the actual breach and its detection
may have given attackers enough time to locate sensitive information and exfiltrate this
information.
With the enhanced post-breach detection capabilities of Windows Defender ATP, SOC
personnel are able to reduce this period to hours or even minutes, significantly lessening the
potential impact of persistent attacker access to their network. Windows Defender ATP
provides extensive information about activity groups responsible for the attacks, enabling
customers to understand aspects of the attack that may not be obtained by network and
endpoint sensors, such as common social engineering lures and the regional nature of an
attack. With relevant visualized information, analysts are able to study malware behavior on
impacted machines, so they can investigate further and plan out their response. And, finally,
with the upcoming Creators Update, Windows Defender ATP will provide additional
capabilities for detecting threats such as Winnti, as well as centralized response options,
such as machine isolation and file blocking, that will enable fast containment of known attack
jump off points.
