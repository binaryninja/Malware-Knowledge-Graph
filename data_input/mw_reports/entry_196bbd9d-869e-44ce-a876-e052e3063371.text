In a novel approach to ransom demands, a new ransomware calling itself
'NitroRansomware' encrypts victim's files and then demands a Discord Nitro gift code to
decrypt files.
While Discord is free, they offer a Nitro subscription add-on for $9.99 per month that
provides additional perks, such as larger uploads, HD video streaming, enhanced emojis,
and the ability to boost your favorite server, so its users enjoy extra functionality as well.
When purchasing a Nitro subscription, users can apply it to their own account or buy it as a
gift for another person. When gifting, the purchaser will be given an URL in the format
https://discord.gift/[code], which can then be given to another Discord user.

Gifting a Nitro subscription

Not your typical ransom demand
While most ransomware operations demand thousands, if not millions, of dollars in
cryptocurrency, Nitro Ransomware deviates from the norm by demanding a $9.99 Nitro Gift
code instead.
Based on filenames for NitroRansomware samples shared by MalwareHunterteam and
analyzed by BleepingComputer, this new ransomware appears to be distributed as a fake
tool stating it can generate free Nitro gift codes.
When executed, the ransomware will encrypt a person's files and append the .givemenitro
extension to encrypted files, as shown below.

Files encrypted by the NitroRansomware
When finished, NitroRansomware will change the user's wallpaper to an evil or angry
Discord logo, as shown below.

A ransomware screen will then be displayed demanding a free Nitro gift code within three
hours, or ransomware will delete the victim's encrypted files. This timer appears to be an
idle threat as the ransomware samples seen by BleepingComputer do not delete any files
when the timer reaches zero.

When a user enters a Nitro gift code URL, the ransomware will verify it using a Discord API
URL, as shown below. If a valid gift code link is entered, the ransomware will decrypt the
files using an embedded static decryption key.

Checking if a Discord Nitro gift code is valid
As the decryption keys are static and are contained within the ransomware executable, it is
possible to decrypt the files without actually paying the Nitro gift code ransom.

Therefore, if you fall victim to this ransomware, you can share a link for the executable to
extract a decryption key.
Unfortunately, in addition to encrypting your files, the Nitro Ransomware will also perform
other malicious activity on a victim's computer.

Stealing tokens and executing commands
It would not be Discord-related malware if the threat actors didn't try to steal a victim's
Discord tokens.
Discord tokens are authentication keys tied to a particular user, that when stolen, allow a
threat actor to log in as the associated user.
When NitroRansomware starts, it will search for a victim's Discord installation path and then
extract user tokens from the *.ldb files located under "Local Storage\leveldb." These tokens
are then sent back to the threat actor over a Discord webhook.

Stealing Discord user tokens
As part of this process, the malware will also attempt to steal data from Google Chrome,
Brave Browser, and Yandex Browser.
NitroRansomware also includes functionality to execute commands and have the output
sent through the webhook to the attacker's Discord channel. This is currently only used to
get the computer's UUID using the 'wmic csproduct get uuid' command.

5/8

Acting as a backdoor to execute remote commands
The good news is that this ransomware does not do a good job hiding its decryption key,
and users can recover their files for free.
However, the bad news is that the threat actor will likely have already stolen a user's
Discord token.
Due to this, users infected with this ransomware should immediately change their Discord
password in case their account has been compromised.
Update 4/19/21: Added that the malware also steals information from browsers.

not trying to sound like i'm advocating for anything bad, but If the info and the nitro gift
gets sent trough a webhook, it's possible to remove it by sending a DELETE request
to it (if said webhook is easily accesible), hopefully someone has done this already

reported it to discord already through a partner friend of mine, hopefully all nitro
should be refunded, along with server removal/nuke.

Quite ironic really, people who are trying to steal nitro end up buying it for someone
else just to keep their stuff.
