Threat actors strive to cause Tax Day headaches

Threat actors often take advantage of current events and major news headlines to align
attacks and leverage social engineering when people could be more likely to be distracted or
misled. Tax season is particularly appealing to threat actors because not only are people
busy and under stress, but it is intrinsically tied to financial information. With U.S. Tax Day
approaching, Microsoft has observed phishing attacks targeting accounting and tax return
preparation firms to deliver the Remcos remote access trojan (RAT) and compromise target
networks beginning in February of this year.
Remcos, which stands for “Remote Control and Surveillance”, is a closed-source tool that
allows threat actors to gain administrator privileges on Windows systems remotely. It was
released in 2016 by BreakingSecurity, a European company that markets Remcos and other
offensive security tools as legitimate software. In 2021, CISA listed Remcos among its top
malware strains, citing its use in mass phishing attacks using COVID-19 pandemic themes
targeting businesses and individuals.
While social engineering lures like this one are common around Tax Day and other big topic
current events, these campaigns are specific and targeted in a way that is uncommon. The
targets for this threat are exclusively organizations that deal with tax preparation, financial
services, CPA and accounting firms, and professional service firms dealing in bookkeeping
and tax. This campaign can be detected in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, built into Windows
and on by default, as well as Microsoft 365 Defender.
The campaign uses lures masquerading as tax documentation sent by a client, while the link
in the email uses a legitimate click-tracking service to evade detection. The target is then
redirected to a legitimate file hosting site, where the actor has uploaded Windows shortcut
(.LNK) files.

These LNK files generate web requests to actor-controlled domains and/or IP addresses to
download malicious files. These malicious files then perform actions on the target device and
download the Remcos payload, providing the actor potential access to the target device and
network.
Microsoft is sharing this information along with detections and recommendations with the
community to help users and defenders stay vigilant against this campaign with Tax Day
approaching in the U.S. on April 18. Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Defender
Antivirus detect and block Remcos and other malicious activity related to this campaign.

Phishing campaign analysis
What we have observed is that the link in the phishing email points to Amazon Web Services
click tracking service at awstrack[.]me. The initial link then redirects the target to a ZIP file
hosted on legitimate file-sharing service spaces[.]hightail[.]com. The ZIP file contains LNK
files that act as Windows shortcuts to other files. The LNK files make web requests to actorcontrolled domains and
IP addresses to download additional malicious files such as MSI files containing DLLs or
executables, VBScript files containing PowerShell commands, or deceptive PDFs.

In some cases, GuLoader was used to execute shellcode and subsequently download
Remcos on the target system. GuLoader is a malicious downloader that has been used by
many different actors to deliver a wide variety of malware, including several RATs such as
Remcos, through phishing campaigns since it was first observed in the wild in December
2019. The downloader uses several techniques to evade analysis and detection such as
using legitimate file-sharing sites and cloud hosting services for payload storage and delivery
as well as encryption and obfuscation of the GuLoader shellcode and payloads.
Successful delivery of a Remcos payload could provide an attacker the opportunity to take
control of the target device to steal information and/or move laterally through the target
network.

Recommendations and detections
Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat:

3/5

Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content
Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list
criterion
Enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus scanning of downloaded files and attachments
Enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time behavior monitoring
Enable cloud-delivered protection

Detection details
Microsoft Defender for Office 365
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects phishing emails associated with the campaign
discussed in this blog.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus
Microsoft Defender Antivirus, on by default on Windows machines, detects threat
components as the following malware:
Backdoor:Win32/Remcos.GA!MTB
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
Alerts with the following titles in the security center can indicate threat activity on your
network:
‘Remcos’ backdoor
Suspicious ‘Remcos’ behavior
‘Remcos’ malware
‘Guloader’ malware
Microsoft Sentinel
Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytic (a series of analytics all
prefixed with “TI map”) to automatically match the indicators mentioned in this blog post with
data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can
install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the
analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace. More details on the Content Hub can be
