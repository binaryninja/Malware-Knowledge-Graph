A few days ago we detected a watering hole campaign in a website owned by one
big industrial company.
The website is related to software used for simulation and system engineering in a wide
range of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing.
The attackers were able to compromise the website and include code that loaded a
malicious Javascript file from a remote server. This Javascript file is a framework for
reconnaissance that the attackers call "Scanbox" and includes some of the techniques we
described in a previous blog post: Attackers abusing Internet Explorer to enumerate
software and detect security products
The Scanbox framework first configures the remote C&C server that it will use and collects
a small amount of information about the victim that is visiting the compromised website
including:
Referer
User-Agent
Location
Cookie
Title (To identify specific content that the victim is visiting)
Domain
Charset
Screen width and height
Operating System
Language
Resulting in something like this:

Before sending the information to the C&C server, Scanbox encodes and encrypts the data
with the following function:

Producing the following request:

If we decrypt the data it translates to:

After the first request, the framework contains several plugins to extract different information
from the victim.
Pluginid 1: Enumerates software installed in the system using the technique we explained
before that affects Internet Explorer. It also checks if the system is running different versions
of EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit):

Pluginid 2: Enumerates Adobe Flash versions
Pluginid 5: Enumerates Microsoft Office versions
Pluginid 6: Enumerates Acrobat Reader versions
Pluginid 8: Enumerates Java versions
Pluginid 21: Implements a “keylogger” functionality trough Javascript that logs all the
keystrokes the victim is typing inside the compromised website.

While the user is browsing the compromised website, all keystrokes are being recorded and
sent to the C&C periodically. It will also send keystrokes when the user submits web forms
that can potentially include passwords and other sensitive data.
As we have seen, this is a very powerful framework that gives attackers a lot of insight into
the potential targets that will help them launching future attacks against them.
We have also seen several Metasploit-produced exploits that target different versions of
Java in the same IP address that hosts the Scanbox framework (122.10.9[.]109).
We recommend you look for this type of activity against the following machines in your
network:
mail[.]webmailgoogle.com
js[.]webmailgoogle.com
122[.]10.9.109
