A new ransomware called Nefilim that shares much of the same code as Nemty has started
to become active in the wild and threatens to release stolen data.
Nefilim became active at the end of February 2020 and while it not known for sure how the
ransomware is being distributed, it is most likely through exposed Remote Desktop Services.
Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez and ID Ransomware's Michael Gillespie both told
BleepingComputer that Nefilim and Nemty 2.5 share much of the same code.
The main difference is that Nefilim has removed the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
component and now relies on email communications for payments rather than a Tor payment
site.
It is not known if this is a fork of their ransomware from the original operators or if new threat
actors obtained the source code to release a new version.

Nefilim threatens to release data
In the Nefilim ransom note, the attackers state that if a user does not pay the ransom in
seven days they will release data that was stolen from the network.

A large amount of your private files have been extracted and is kept in a secure location.
If you do not contact us in seven working days of the breach we will start leaking the data.
After you contact us we will provide you proof that your files have been extracted.
In the past, this would have been seen as an empty threat, but with ransomware infections
such as Maze, Sodinokibi, DoppelPaymer, and Nemty all following through with their threats,
it should no longer be ignored.

The Nefilim encryption process
When encrypting files, Nefilim will encrypt a file using AES-128 encryption. This AES
encryption key will then be encrypted by an RSA-2048 public key that is embedded in the
ransomware executable.
This encrypted AES key will then be added to the contents of each encrypted file and can
only be decrypted by the RSA private key known to the ransomware developers.
For each encrypted file, Nefilim will append the .NEFILIM extension to the file name. For
example, a file called 1.doc would be encrypted and named 1.doc.NEFILIM.

Files encrypted by the Nefilim Ransomware
In addition to the encrypted AES key, the ransomware will also add the "NEFILIM" string as a
file marker to all encrypted files as shown below.

NEFILIM file marker

When done, a ransom note named NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt will be created throughout the
system that contains instructions on how to contact the ransomware developers.
This ransom note contains different contact emails and the threat that they will leak data if a
ransom is not paid within seven days of the "breach".

Unfortunately, a brief analysis by Gillespie indicates that this ransomware appears to be
secure, which means that there is no current way to recover files for free.
The ransomware, though, is still being researched and if new weaknesses we will publish
updated information.
