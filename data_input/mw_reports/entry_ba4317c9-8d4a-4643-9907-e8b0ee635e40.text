Reporting Service. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com
In September 2017, we discovered a new targeted attack on financial institutions. Victims are
mostly Russian banks but we also found infected organizations in Malaysia and Armenia.
The attackers were using a known but still very effective technique for cybercriminals looking
to make money: gaining persistent access to an internal banking network for a long period of
time, making video recordings of the day to day activity on bank employees’ PCs, learning
how things works in their target banks, what software is being used, and then using that
knowledge to steal as much money as possible when ready.
We saw that technique before in Carbanak, and other similar cases worldwide. The infection
vector is a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment. An interesting point in the
Silence attack is that the cybercriminals had already compromised banking infrastructure in
1/10

order to send their spear-phishing emails from the addresses of real bank employees and
look as unsuspicious as possible to future victims.
The attacks are currently still ongoing.

Technical details
The cybercriminals using Silence send spear-phishing emails as initial infection vectors,
often using the addresses of employees of an already infected financial institution, with a
request to open an account in the attacked bank. The message looks like a routine request.
Using this social engineering trick, it looks unsuspicious to the receiver:

Malicious .chm attachment

Type

Windows help .chm file

The attachment we detected in this new wave is a “Microsoft Compiled HTML Help” file. This
is a Microsoft proprietary online help format that consists of a collection of HTML pages,
indexing and other navigation tools. These files are compressed and deployed in a binary
format with the .CHM (compiled HTML) extension. These files are highly interactive and can
run a series of technologies including JavaScript, which can redirect a victim towards an
external URL after simply opening the CHM. Attackers began exploiting CHM files to
automatically run malicious payloads once the file is accessed. Once the attachment is

opened by the victim, the embedded .htm content file (“start.htm”) is executed. This file
contains JavaScript, and its goal is to download and execute another stage from a
hardcoded URL:

The goal of the script is to download and execute an obfuscated .VBS script which again
downloads and executes the final dropper

The dropper is a win32 executable binary file, and its main goal is to communicate with the
command and control (C&C) server, send the ID of the infected machine and download and
execute malicious payloads.
After executing, the dropper connects to the C&C using a GET request, sends the generated
victim ID, downloads the payloads and executes them using the CreateProcess function.

Payloads
The payloads are a number of modules executed on the infected system for various tasks
like screen recording, data uploading etc.
All the payload modules we were able to identify are registered as Windows services.

Windows service executable

The main task for this module is to monitor the activity of the victim. In order to do so it takes
multiple screenshots of the victim´s active screen, providing a real-time pseudo-video stream
with all the victim´s activity. A very similar technique was used in the Carbanak case, where
this monitoring was used to understand the victim´s day to day activity.
The module is registered and started by a Windows service named “Default monitor”.

Malicious service module name

After the initial startup, it creates a Windows named pipe with a hardcoded value – “\\.\pipe\
{73F7975A-A4A2-4AB6-9121-AECAE68AABBB}”. This pipe is used for sharing data in
malicious inter-process communications between modules.

Named pipe creation

The malware decrypts a block of data and saves it as a binary file with the hardcoded name
“mss.exe” in a Windows temporary location, and later executes it using the
CreateProcessAsUserA function. This dropped binary is the module responsible for the realtime screen activity recording.
Then, the monitoring module waits for a new dropped module to start in order to share the
recorded data with other modules using the named pipe.

Windows 32 executable

This module uses both the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) and the Windows API
to record victim screen activity. This is done using the CreateCompatibleBitmap and
GdipCreateBitmapFromHBITMAP functions. Then the module connects to the named pipe
created by the previously described module and writes the data in there. This technique
allows for the creation of a pseudo-video stream of the victim’s activity by putting together all
the collected bitmaps.

Type

Windows service executable

The C&C communication module is a Windows service, as are all the other modules. Its
main functionality is to provide backconnect access to the victim machine using console
command execution. After the service initialization, it decrypts the needed Windows API
function names, loads them with LoadLibrary and resolves with GetProcAddress functions.

WinAPI resolving

After successful loading of the WinAPI functions, the malware tries to connect to the C&C
server using a hardcoded IP address (185.161.209[.]81).

C&C IP

The malware sends a special request to the command server with its ID and then waits for a
response, which consists of a string providing the code of what operation to execute. The
options are:
“htrjyytrn” which is the transliteration of “reconnect” (“реконнект” in russian layout).
“htcnfhn” which is the transliteration of “restart” (“рестарт” in russian layout).
“ytnpflfybq” which is the transliteration of “нет заданий” meaning “no tasks”
Finally the malware receives instructions on what console commands to execute, which it
does using a new cmd.exe process with a parameter command.

Instruction check

The described procedure allows attackers to install any other malicious modules. That can
be easily done using the “sc create” console command.

Also, on some infected computers we found a tool called the Winexesvc tool. This tool
basically provides the same functionality as the well-known “psexec” tool. The main
difference is that the Winexesvc tool enables the execution of remote commands from Linuxbased operating system. When the Linux binary “winexe” is run against a Windows server,
the winexesvc.exe executable is created and installed as a service.

Conclusion
Attacks on financial organization remain a very effective way for cybercriminals to make
money. The analysis of this case provides us with a new Trojan, apparently being used in
multiple international locations, which suggests it is an expanding activity of the group. The
Trojan provides monitoring capabilities similar to the ones used by the Carbanak group.
The group uses legitimate administration tools to fly under the radar in their post-exploitation
phase, which makes detection of malicious activity, as well as attribution more complicated.
This kind of attack has become widespread in recent years, which is a very worrisome trend
as it demonstrates that criminals are successful in their attacks. We will continue monitoring
the activity for this new campaign.
The spear-phishing infection vector is still the most popular way to initiate targeted
campaigns. When used with already compromised infrastructure, and combined with .chm
attachments, it seems to be a really effective way of spreading, at least among financial
organizations.

Recommendations
The effective way of protection from targeted attacks focused on financial organizations are
preventive advanced detection capabilities such as a solution that can detect all types of
anomalies and scrutinize suspicious files at a deeper level, be present on users’ systems.
The Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack solution (KATA) matches events coming from different
infrastructure levels, discerns anomalies and aggregates them into incidents, while also
studying related artifacts in a safe environment of a sandbox. As with most Kaspersky
products, KATA is powered by HuMachine Intelligence, which is backed by on premise and in
lab-running machine learning processes coupled with real-time analyst expertise and our
understanding of threat intelligence big data.
The best way to prevent attackers from finding and leveraging security holes, is to eliminate
the holes altogether, including those involving improper system configurations or errors in
proprietary applications. For this, Kaspersky Penetration Testing and Application Security
Assessment services can become a convenient and highly effective solution, providing not
only data on found vulnerabilities, but also advising on how to fix it, further strengthening
corporate security.
