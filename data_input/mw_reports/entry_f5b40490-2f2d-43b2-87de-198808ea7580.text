TraderTraitor: North Korean State-Sponsored APT Targets Blockchain Companies
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-108a

Summary
Actions to take today to mitigate cyber threats to cryptocurrency:
• Patch all systems.
• Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.
• Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts.
• Use multifactor authentication.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the U.S. Treasury
Department (Treasury) are issuing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight the cyber threat associated with cryptocurrency
thefts and tactics used by a North Korean state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group since at least 2020. This group is
commonly tracked by the cybersecurity industry as Lazarus Group, APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima. For more information on
North Korean state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, visit https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.
The U.S. government has observed North Korean cyber actors targeting a variety of organizations in the blockchain technology and
cryptocurrency industry, including cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play-to-earn cryptocurrency video
games, cryptocurrency trading companies, venture capital funds investing in cryptocurrency, and individual holders of large amounts of
cryptocurrency or valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The activity described in this advisory involves social engineering of victims
using a variety of communication platforms to encourage individuals to download trojanized cryptocurrency applications on Windows or
macOS operating systems. The cyber actors then use the applications to gain access to the victim’s computer, propagate malware
across the victim’s network environment, and steal private keys or exploit other security gaps. These activities enable additional followon activities that initiate fraudulent blockchain transactions.
The U.S. government previously published an advisory about North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors using AppleJeus malware to
steal cryptocurrency: AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea’s Cryptocurrency Malware. The U.S. government has also previously
published advisories about North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors stealing money from banks using custom malware:
This advisory provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to stakeholders
in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry to help them identify and mitigate cyber threats against cryptocurrency.

Technical Details
Threat Update
The U.S. government has identified a group of North Korean state-sponsored malicious cyber actors using tactics similar to the
previously identified Lazarus Group (see AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea’s Cryptocurrency Malware). The Lazarus Group used
AppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency applications targeting individuals and companies—including cryptocurrency exchanges and
financial services companies—through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were modified to include malware
that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. As of April 2022, North Korea’s Lazarus Group actors have targeted various firms, entities, and
exchanges in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry using spearphishing campaigns and malware to steal cryptocurrency. These
actors will likely continue exploiting vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency technology firms, gaming companies, and exchanges to generate
and launder funds to support the North Korean regime.
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
Intrusions begin with a large number of spearphishing messages sent to employees of cryptocurrency companies—often working in
system administration or software development/IT operations (DevOps)—on a variety of communication platforms. The messages often
mimic a recruitment effort and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency applications,
which the U.S. government refers to as "TraderTraitor."
The term TraderTraitor describes a series of malicious applications written using cross-platform JavaScript code with the Node.js
runtime environment using the Electron framework. The malicious applications are derived from a variety of open-source projects and
purport to be cryptocurrency trading or price prediction tools. TraderTraitor campaigns feature websites with modern design advertising
the alleged features of the applications (see figure 1).

Figure 1: Screenshot of CryptAIS website
The JavaScript code providing the core functions of the software is bundled with Webpack. Within the code is a function that purports to
be an “update,” with a name such as UpdateCheckSync() , that downloads and executes a malicious payload (see figure 2).
The update function makes an HTTP POST request to a PHP script hosted on the TraderTraitor project’s domain at either the endpoint
/update/ or /oath/checkupdate.php . In recent variants, the server’s response is parsed as a JSON document with a key-value
pair, where the key is used as an AES 256 encryption key in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Counter (CTR) mode to decrypt the value.
The decrypted data is written as a file to the system’s temporary directory, as provided by the os.tmpdir() method of Node.js, and
executed using the child_process.exec() method of Node.js, which spawns a shell as a child process of the current Electron
application. The text “Update Finished” is then logged to the shell for the user to see.
Observed payloads include updated macOS and Windows variants of Manuscrypt, a custom remote access trojan (RAT), that collects
system information and has the ability to execute arbitrary commands and download additional payloads (see North Korean Remote
Access Tool: COPPERHEDGE). Post-compromise activity is tailored specifically to the victim’s environment and at times has been
completed within a week of the initial intrusion.

DAFOM
DAFOM purports to be a “cryptocurrency portfolio application.” A Mach-O binary packaged within the Electron application was signed by
an Apple digital signature issued for the Apple Developer Team W58CYKFH67. The certificate associated with Apple Developer Team
W58CYKFH67 has been revoked. A metadata file packaged in the DAFOM application provided the URL
hxxps://github[.]com/dafomdev for bug reports. As of April 2022, this page was unavailable.

TokenAIS
TokenAIS purports to help “build a portfolio of AI-based trading” for cryptocurrencies. Mach-O binaries packaged within the Electron
application contained an Apple digital signature issued for the Apple Developer Team RN4BTXA4SA. The certificate associated with
Apple Developer Team RN4BTXA4SA has been revoked. The application requires users to “register” an account by entering an email
address and a password to use its features. The malicious TraderTraitor code is a Node.js function called UpdateCheckSync()
located in a file named update.js , which is bundled in a file called renderer.prod.js , which is in an archive called app.asar .
This function passes the email address that the user provided and the system platform to the C2 server, decrypts the response using
AES 256 in CBC mode with the hardcoded initialization vector (IV) !@34QWer%^78TYui and a key provided in the response, then
writes the decrypted data to a file and executes it in a new shell.

AlticGO
AlticGO was observed packaged as Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) Windows executables that extracted an Electron
application packaged for Windows. These executables contain a simpler version of TraderTraitor code in a function exported as
UpdateCheckSync() located in a file named update.js , which is bundled in renderer.prod.js, which is in the app.asar archive. The
function calls an external function located in a file node_modules/request/index.js bundled in renderer.prod.js to make an HTTP
request to hxxps://www.alticgo[.]com/update/. One AlticGO sample,
e3d98cc4539068ce335f1240deb1d72a0b57b9ca5803254616ea4999b66703ad , instead contacts
hxxps://www.esilet[.]com/update/ (see below for more information about Esilet). Some image resources bundled with the
application included the CreAI Deck logo (see below for more information about CreAI Deck). The response is written to disk and
executed in a new shell using the child_process.exec() method in Node.js . Unlike newer versions of TraderTraitor, there is no
mechanism to decrypt a payload.

Mitigations
North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors use a full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks of interest, acquire
sensitive cryptocurrency-intellectual property, and gain financial assets. The U.S. government recommends implementing mitigations to
protect critical infrastructure organizations as well as financial sector organizations in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency
industry.
Apply defense-in-depth security strategy. Apply security principles—such as least access models and defense-in-depth—to user
and application privileges to help prevent exploitation attempts from being successful. Use network segmentation to separate
networks into zones based on roles and requirements. Separate network zones can help prevent lateral movement throughout the
organization and limit the attack surface. See NSA’s Top Ten Cybersecurity Mitigation Strategies for strategies enterprise
organizations should use to build a defense-in-depth security posture.
Implement patch management. Initial and follow-on exploitation involves leveraging common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)
to gain access to a networked environment. Organizations should have a timely vulnerability and patch management program in
place to mitigate exposure to critical CVEs. Prioritize patching of internet-facing devices and monitored accordingly for any
malicious logic attacks.
Enforce credential requirements and multifactor authentication. North Korean malicious cyber actors continuously target user
credentials, email, social media, and private business accounts. Organizations should ensure users change passwords regularly
to reduce the impact of password spraying and other brute force techniques. The U.S. government recommends organizations
implement and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of credential theft. Be aware of MFA interception
techniques for some MFA implementations and monitor for anomalous logins.
Educate users on social engineering on social media and spearphishing. North Korean actors rely heavily on social engineering,
leveraging email and social media platforms to build trust and send malicious documents to unsuspecting users. A cybersecurity
aware workforce is one of the best defenses against social engineering techniques like phishing. User training should include how
to identify social engineering techniques and awareness to only open links and attachments from trusted senders.
Implement email and domain mitigations. Maintain awareness of themed emails surrounding current events. Malicious cyber
actors use current events as lure for potential victims as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizations should have a
robust domain security solution that includes leveraging reputation checks and closely monitoring or blocking newly registered
domains (NRDs) in enterprise traffic. NRDs are commonly established by threat actors prior to malicious engagement.
HTML and email scanning. Organizations should disable HTML from being used in emails and scan email attachments.
Embedded scripts may be hard for an antivirus product to detect if they are fragmented. An additional malware scanning
interface product can be integrated to combine potentially malicious payloads and send the payload to the primary antivirus
product. Hyperlinks in emails should also be scanned and opened with precautionary measures to reduce the likelihood of a
user clicking on a malicious link.
Endpoint protection. Although network security is critical, devices mobility often means traveling and connecting to multiple
different networks that offer varying levels of security. To reduce the risk of introducing exposed hosts to critical networks,
organizations should ensure mobile devices have installed security suites to detect and mitigate malware.
Enforce application security. Application allowlisting enables the organization to monitor programs and only allow those on the
approved allowlist to execute. Allowlisting helps to stop the initial attack, even if the user clicks a malicious link or opens a
malicious attachment. Implement baseline rule sets, such as NSA’s Limiting Location Data Exposure guidance, to block execution
of unauthorized or malicious programs.
Disable macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing code through an attached office document.
Some office products allow for the disabling of macros that originate from outside of the organization, providing a hybrid
approach when the organization depends on the legitimate use of macros.
Windows specific settings can be configured to block internet-originated macros from running. This can be done in the
Group Policy Administrative Templates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel and
PowerPoint). Other productivity software, such as LibreOffice and OpenOffice, can be configured to set the Macro
Security Level.
Be aware of third-party downloads—especially cryptocurrency applications. North Korean actors have been increasingly active
with currency generation operations. Users should always verify file downloads and ensure the source is from a reputable or
primary (preferred) source and not from a third-party vendor. Malicious cyber actors have continuously demonstrated the ability to
trojanize applications and gain a foothold on host devices.
Create an incident response plan to respond to possible cyber intrusions. The plan should include reporting incidents to both the
FBI and CISA—quick reporting can reduce the severity of incidents and provide valuable information to investigators. Contact
information can be found below.
