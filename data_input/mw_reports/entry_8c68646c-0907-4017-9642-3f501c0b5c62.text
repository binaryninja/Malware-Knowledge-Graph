Symantec has uncovered the operations of a threat actor named Leafminer that is targeting
a broad list of government organizations and business verticals in various regions in the
Middle East since at least early 2017. The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques
and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits.
Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering
hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and bruteforce/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group
is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems.

Leafminer’s arsenal
During our investigation, there was a breakthrough discovery that helped connect Leafminer
to a number of attacks observed on systems in the Middle East and identify the toolkit used
in the group’s efforts of intrusion, lateral movement, and exfiltration. The download URL for a
malware payload used in one of the attacks lead to the identification of a compromised web
server on the domain e-qht.az that had been used to distribute Leafminer’s arsenal of
malware, payloads, and tools within the group and make them available for download from
victim machines.
As of early June 2018, the server hosted 112 files in a subdirectory that could be accessed
through a public web shell planted by the attackers. In addition to malware and tools, the
served files also included uploads of log files seemingly originating from vulnerability scans
and post-compromise tools.
The web shell is a modification of the PhpSpy backdoor and references the author
MagicCoder while linking to the (deleted) domain magiccoder.ir. Researching the hacker
handle MagicCoder results in references to the Iranian hacking forum Ashiyane as well as
defacements by the Iranian hacker group Sun Army.

Targets
During the investigation of the Leafminer group, we were able to assemble a targeting profile
from different sources including telemetry and log files hosted publicly on the attacker’s
arsenal server.
One interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer
investigation was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans.
Symantec detection telemetry shows malware and custom tools used by Leafminer on 44
systems across four regions in the Middle East.

One interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer investigation
was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans. The list is written in the
Iranian language Farsi and groups each entry with organization of interest by geography and
industry. Figure 3 shows a breakdown of the industry verticals. Targeted regions included in
the list are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, and
Afghanistan.

Intrusion
We observed three main techniques used by Leafminer for initial intrusion of target networks:
Compromised web servers used for watering hole attacks
Scans/exploits for vulnerabilities of network services
Dictionary attacks against logins of network services
There are indicators that suggest the attackers have also employed email phishing with
malicious attachment files. However, this was not directly observed or captured.

Watering hole SMB credential theft
Our investigation of Leafminer started with the discovery of JavaScript code on several
compromised websites in the Middle East. The obfuscated code was planted by the
attackers to steal SMB credential hashes that could subsequently be brute-forced offline.
When executing the code, the browser creates an invisible image tag and sets the URL to an
attack server using the file:// protocol scheme. On Windows machines, this triggers a request
to a remote server via the Samba networking protocol (SMB) that also transmits the user’s
login NTLM hash. These hashes can be cracked to retrieve the original login password by
methods of brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow table lookups.
Table 1 shows an overview of the compromised websites used as watering holes, infected
JavaScript URLs, and SMB URLs used to collect NTLM hashes.

Interestingly, the same technique was also observed in watering hole attacks by the threat
actor Dragonfly in 2017 as reported by Symantec.

Vulnerability scans and exploitation
As previously mentioned, Leafminer seems to be actively following developments and
publications of the offensive security community when selecting their toolkit. This became
especially apparent when analyzing the group’s techniques and tools for vulnerability scans
and exploitation. The compromised web server used to store Leafminer’s arsenal hosted
several public proof-of-concept exploits and exploitation tools.

actors https://symc.ly/2MNFOOD"

This included the Fuzzbunch framework that was part of an infamous leak of exploits and
tools by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017. Leafminer has developed exploit payloads for this
framework (Table 2) that deliver custom malware through attacks against SMB vulnerabilities
described by Microsoft. The EternalBlue exploit from the framework received worldwide
attention after being used in the ransomware campaigns WannaCry in May and
Petya/NotPetya in June 2017. The Leafminer operators use EternalBlue to attempt lateral
movement within target networks from compromised staging servers.
Symantec also observed attempts by Leafminer to scan for the Heartbleed vulnerability
(CVE-2014-0160) from an attacker-controlled IP address. Furthermore, the Leafminer
arsenal server hosted a Python script to scan for this vulnerability.

Dictionary attacks
Another intrusion approach used by Leafminer seems a lot less sophisticated than the
previously described methods but can be just as effective: using specific hacktools to guess
the login passwords for services exposed by a targeted system. This type of attack was
observed both via dedicated servers set up by Leafminer as well as staging servers
compromised by the group.

7/14

Commands found in a readme text that was stored in a ZIP archive together with the
hacktool THC Hydra in Leafminer’s tool arsenal represent online dictionary attacks on
Microsoft Exchange and Remote Desktop Protocol services of regional government servers
in Saudi Arabia. "Online" in this case refers to the attacker using the protocol of the targeted
network service to quickly run through many password guesses.

Custom malware
Symantec identified two strains of custom malware used by the Leafminer group:
Trojan.Imecab and Backdoor.Sorgu. Directly connected to this malware are several sets of
reflective loader DLLs used as droppers or to execute specific commands on a compromised
system.
The development of custom malware by Leafminer as well as some of the tools used for
lateral movement show a preference for the .NET framework. We also observed that the
attackers would download and install the .NET framework on compromised machines,
supposedly in the situation that an operator would have remote access to the system but
required .NET to run Leafminer's custom tools. To this end, the command and control (C&C)
server operated by the group hosted the legitimate setup executable for Microsoft .NET
Framework 2.0 SP2.

Backdoor.Sorgu
Backdoor.Sorgu is used by the attackers to provide remote access to the infected machine.
The backdoor is installed as a service in the Windows system through a shell command
script.

Trojan.Imecab
The purpose of Trojan.Imecab is to set up a persistent remote access account on the target
machine with a hardcoded password. Variants of the malware were also observed with the
filename guester.exe which likely refers to the functionality of adding a powerful guest
account to the system.
The malware installs itself in the system as a Windows service to achieve persistence and
ensure that the guest account remains available to the attacker.

Reflective loader DLLs
Table 2 gives an overview of the reflective loader DLLs and their purpose:

Table 2. Reflective loader DLLs
These DLLs were likely used as payloads for exploit shellcode of the Fuzzbunch framework,
which is also evidenced by the embedded PDB strings.

Lateral movement and exfiltration
The discovery of malware and hacktools hosted on e-qht.az allowed us to correlate detection
telemetry of potential Leafminer intrusions with tools made available for download to the
group’s operators. Understanding the purpose of the tools used by the attacker gives a
unique insight into the tactics and procedures used by Leafminer after the initial compromise
of a target network.
Table 3 outlines the observed toolset for lateral movement, information gathering, and
exfiltration.

Table 3. Toolset for lateral movement, information gathering, and exfiltration
We discovered a number of servers compromised by Leafminer that were used as staging
systems to gain a foothold in the targeted network and execute attacks on intranet
resources. For example, the use of THC Hydra to execute dictionary attacks against
Exchange logins was observed both in initial intrusion attempts as well as in lateral attacks
from staging systems.
Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the Total SMB BruteForcer hacktool used by Leafminer for
lateral movement. The tool requires input files with lists of IPs, users, and passwords
respectively.

Figure 4. Total SMB BruteForcer
The arsenal server hosted five text files that could be used by Leafminer operators as input
for dictionary attacks using Total SMB Bruteforcer and THC Hydra.

OrangeTeghal and Process Doppelgänging
One of the custom tools used by the Leafminer group is a rebranded version of the
widespread post-exploitation tool Mimikatz.

Figure 5.

OrangeTeghal
While the logo and commands are identical to the original hacktool, the name was changed
to OrangeTeghal. To evade security software while deploying this tool on compromised
systems, the attackers use a technique revealed at Black Hat EU ‘17 in the presentation Lost
in Transaction: Process Doppelgänging. The malware file orange64.exe is a .NET
executable that drops and executes a PowerShell script with basic obfuscation. After

deobfuscation, this script closely resembles the code published by the authors of the
technique. Process Doppelgänging uses NTFS transactions to modify the executable of a
seemingly benign process that is suspended right after creation.

Ambitions blunted by inexperience
Leafminer is a highly active group, responsible for targeting a range of organizations across
the Middle East. The group appears to be based in Iran and seems to be eager to learn from
and capitalize on tools and techniques used by more advanced threat actors.
On a broad level, it has followed the recent trend among targeted attack groups for “living off
the land”—using a mixture of publicly available tools alongside its own custom malware.
More specifically, it mimicked Dragonfly’s use of a watering hole to harvest network
credentials. It also capitalized on the Shadow Brokers release of Inception Framework tools,
making use of the leaked Fuzzbunch framework by developing its own exploit payloads for it.
Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of
the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security.
Leafminer has also been tracking developments in the world of cyber security. After the
Heartbleed bug was disclosed it began scanning for instances of the vulnerability. It also
utilized Process Doppelgänging, a detection evasion technique first discussed at the Black
Hat EU conference last year.
However, Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the
part of the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security. It
made a major blunder in leaving a staging server publicly accessible, exposing the group’s
entire arsenal of tools. That one misstep provided us with a valuable trove of intelligence to
help us better defend our customers against further Leafminer attacks.

Best Practices
Important passwords, such as those with high privileges, should be at least 8-10
characters long (and preferably longer) and include a mixture of letters and numbers.
Encourage users to avoid reusing the same passwords on multiple websites and
sharing passwords with others should be forbidden. Delete unused credentials and
profiles and limit the number of administrative-level profiles created. Employ two-factor
authentication (such as Symantec VIP) to provide an additional layer of security,
preventing any stolen credentials from being used by attackers.
Emphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard
against single point failures in any specific technology or protection method. This
should include the deployment of regularly updated firewalls as well as gateway
antivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), website vulnerability with
malware protection, and web security gateway solutions throughout the network.
Implement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive data is encrypted at
rest and in transit. Ensure that customer data is encrypted as well. This can help
mitigate the damage of potential data leaks from within an organization.
Implement SMB egress traffic filtering on perimeter devices to prevent SMB traffic
leaving your network onto the internet.
Educate employees on the dangers posed by spear-phishing emails, including
exercising caution around emails from unfamiliar sources and opening attachments
that haven’t been solicited. A full protection stack helps to defend against emailed
threats, including Symantec Email Security.cloud, which can block email-borne threats,
and Symantec Endpoint Protection, which can block malware on the
endpoint. Symantec Messaging Gateway’s Disarm technology can also protect
computers from threats by removing malicious content from attached documents
before they even reach the user.
Understanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of adversaries through
services like DeepSight Adversary Intelligence fuels effective defense from advanced
adversaries like Leafminer. Beyond technical understanding of the group, strategic
intelligence that informs the motivation, capability, and likely next moves of the
adversaries ensures more timely and effective decisions in proactively safeguarding
your environment from these threats.
