This week Norsk Hydro, a large multinational manufacturer with 35,000 staff and over 100
years of history, had the nightmare scenario of a worldwide apparent ransom attempt — their
systems began to malfunction, and attackers had placed the following ransom note on their
business and some production systems across the world:

1/14

The ransom note.
Each impacted system had four key elements:
They all ran Microsoft Windows.
Files, including some system files, had been encrypted.
The network interface on every system had been disabled.
The local user accounts on every system had their password changed.
From what I can gather, they have an existing security team and controls, and one of the
things you haven’t seen this time is people online highlighting a ton of obvious security flaws
with their systems (see also, Equifax etc) — so what happened?
“Essentially, there are cascading failures in the technology and security industry to
protect customers.”

The event
The timeline is known as so:
.

2/14

Around midnight (UTC) on Tuesday 19th March, security events were detected in
Americas locations of Hydro.
In the early hours of the morning, the attack began.
By 5am (UTC) Hydro had opted to disconnect their worldwide network (WAN).
Over a month later, the company is still attempting to recover from the attack, and most
of its 160 manufacturing locations are still operating in manual (non-IT driven)
operations.

Why Norsk Hydro ASA as a target?
I do not know, nor care to speculate. I can say for sure they were specifically targeted, as
each LockerGoga payload contains a unique four digital reference number and information
unique to the target.
As business began on Tuesday 19th March 2019, Hydro had no website, no network and no
self managed IT. This is an incredibly difficult situation for a manufacturing company.
The CEO had started the job the day before.
Hydro posted notices at their 40 offices and manufacturing facilities across the world asking
staff to disconnect their devices from local networks, and the recovery effort began.
They informed stock markets they were moving to ‘manual production’, which means they
would operate factories without modern IT.
Each local factory manager was tasked with maintaining customer orders — for example,
some operated from pre-printed list of orders.
For communication, Norsk Hydro ASA uses Office365, which was completely unimpacted —
so staff could still communicate with each other, the press and customers using mobile
phones and tables. Had Hydro not already moved communications to a managed cloud
service, the situation would have been more grave.
For communication with the outside world they used their Facebook account, and redirected
hydro.com to an Azure temporary website:

This website has since been moved to behind Cloudflare, a managed DDoS protection
provider.

Incident representation

Hydro started the best incident representation response plan I’ve ever seen — they had a
temporary website up, they told the press, they told their staff, they apparently didn’t hide any
details — they even had daily webcasts with the most senior staff talking through what was
happening, and answering questions. On the 2nd day they even took questions from
webcast watchers.

4/14

In contrast to some other incidents, their stock price actually went up — despite a difficult
trading period for past 2 years involving some major business setbacks, they have actually
gained in value.

Incident response
Hydro’s website says they have flown in staff from Microsoft and unnamed companies to
help them recover. They have also engaged with national cybercrime bodies, industry groups
and police authorities. The incident is now a police investigation.
Their CFO says they have backups of data which they are attempting to restore, and they
have not paid a ransom.
They say it is unknown how long recovery will take, although in an interview with a
Norwegian news organisation the CIO says full recovery will take months.
Hydro have provided videos about their recovery efforts:

What went wrong?
Security controls and industry
Several weeks ago, I highlighted on Twitter that despite a high profile attack on Altran in
January (34,000 staff members) using LockerGoga, a vast majority of endpoint security antimalware products were failing to detect it. I highlighted this because @malwrhunterteam on
Twitter sent me a message saying ‘look at this and the poor detection’:

7/14

As you can see above the detection rate was 0 out of 67 anti-virus engines. Now, before
vendors get annoyed, I am well aware that VirusTotal results don’t tell the full story —
however having zero detection from any engine is an extremely bad sign. I actually
detonated the ransomware myself on several real world endpoints (in isolated fashion — as
you’ll learn later it doesn’t self replicate too) and I couldn’t find an endpoint security tool
which actually triggered a detection (although Cisco’s ThreatGrid sandbox technology did
classify it as Generic Ransomware).
I used that Twitter thread to pressure several anti-malware producers into action, DMing staff
I knew at said companies to get them to take a look.
I found a few more samples in VirusTotal, clearly still in development — those, too, had little
to no detection. I sent them on informally.

8/14

After the Altran attack, which downed systems at a 34,000 employee company, only a
handful of dialogue happened in the industry — I can only find one news article which
actually mentions LockerGoga, for example, and little to no technical detail.
As far as I’m aware there is not any centralised way to contact everybody in antivirus
industry on international interest, so I completely forgot about it a few people in, and went to
watch Captain Marvel instead.
Essentially, Norsk Hydro’s anti-malware solution did not have detection for the threat
because not all the industry players were paying attention to a cartoon porg on Twitter (me)
and a random person who I think doesn’t work in the industry (MalwareHunterTeam).
I’m not saying that’s how the industry should work, by the way, and I know it sounds self
aggrandising — but I’m trying to make the point that maybe, as an industry, we’re really good
at hyping threats in the media which are not practical in the real world and not great at
looking at all the real world, actual attack data.
While we may be sharing Indicators of Compromise — IoCs — a long list of meaningless
hashes aren’t enough to protect people. The cyber security industry and partners missed a
trick here, as we knew a major company had been attacked in a meaningful way, but it
wasn’t followed up.
Additionally, the digital certificate being used to sign the ransomware was used to sign other
malicious code — in fact it had only been used to sign malicious code — and had been
issued to a company with £1 of assets which wasn’t even a trading company. Upon being
informed of this, the Certificate Authority failed to revoke the certificate in a timely manner —
a continuing issue with the same Certificate Authority, which is trusted by all Windows
9/14

certificate stores. To compound the issue even when revoked a vast majority of security tools
fail to do anything, as they do not retrieve the CRL and check the serial number for
revocation. All security and technology should immediately block or flag code signed with
specifically distrusted certificates. Essentially, there are cascading failures in the technology
and security industry to protect customers.
Another element — some LockerGoga deployments stop endpoint security products (and
backup products) before further deployment:

Lateral movement
LockerGoga does not have any code to self spread, meaning it can not self replicate around
a network — unlike other destructive code such as WannaCry and NotPetya.
This may actually be intentional — because it doesn’t use C2 (‘Command and Control’)
servers and DNS traffic it means it is less likely to picked up by network detection and
endpoint classification tools, too.
So how did they plant LockerGoga? I speculated above it was probably using Active
Directory — something like scheduled tasks or services. The initial assessment from
NorCERT appears to back this up, although the investigation is still ongoing:

In order to pull that off you need remote access — it is not known how the attackers got
access to Norsk Hydro’s network at this stage. I would actually call upon Hydro to do
something very unusual (so far) in incident response and open source release some of the
information in this area later, as I strongly believe it can help protect every company —
including their customers.
Once inside their network, they must have had Domain Administrator rights to execute the
attack. Usually in companies it is extremely easy to get this access, despite the industry hard
selling a range of privileged access management tools, by simply:
fishing logins out of memory using Mimikatz
10/14

taking passwords from Active Directory Group Policy Preferences — they’re often right
there in the XML files. It’s the go to, bread and butter of ‘Red Teams’.
Pass The Hash attacks and surf around the entire network using the same local
administrator passwords because almost nobody deploys Microsoft .
However it happened, they got to domain administrator. Like I say, normally this isn’t
problematic as almost all companies make the same simple Active Directory configuration
errors and fail to prioritise remediation.

Got root?
Once you’re an Active Directory administrator, if you are an attacker you can place the
executable somewhere where every system in an organisation can reach — normally,
organisations universally firewall accept Active Directory traffic internally.
Bingo, you have the keys to the kingdom — the only thing stopping you now is security
controls around endpoint malware, and as we already established those won’t detect
LockerGoga at the time of the attack.

So you can place it on a Domain Controller in the NETLOGON share under Sysvol, which is
replicated to every site with a Domain Controller. Then you can use Group Policy such as
scheduled task creation or service creation to automatically start the LockerGoga
executable.
Immediately, every single laptop, desktop and server connected to Active Directory will
trigger the malicious software.

11/14

Another way to do it is, of course, psexec * – psexec handily supports wildcards.
Many people will talk about ‘air gapping’ Industrial Control Systems (ICS), however many
organisations — almost every organisation I’ve met, in fact — ends up connecting some
elements to Active Directory for benefits such as easy licensing, centralised account control
etc. This leads to a situation where production systems — I’m not talking the technologist
use of production, I mean the manufacturing industry term of systems which do something
critical on the coalface — are linked to a central system which can be misused.
I should be clear here that I’m not saying ICS systems shouldn’t be joined to Active Directory
because risk assessment wise unless you’re an extremely high profile target the benefits
may outweight the risks. I am saying they should probably be joined to an entirely separate
Active Directory forest, and administrator access should be incredibly tightly controlled.

The impact
Left adrift
LockerGoga does a few things, some unique:
It ends up using every CPU core and thread during encryption and is very, very fast.
This is because it spawns hundreds of executables for encryption. On an average
system within a few minutes, it is toast.
Additionally, some technical blogs on LockerGoga mention a list of file types that are
encrypted which only includes things like Office files — I can say first hand that it also
encrypts system files such as DLL files across the C: drive. Since it is deployed as
administrator level using Active Directory, it has full control of all files.
It depends on the version being run (on VirusTotal you can see different LockerGoga
executables with different features) but newer versions use netsh.exe to disable all
network cards after encryption is done.
It then changes every local administrator account password.
It then logs you off, using logoff.exe.

Recovery
On laptops and desktops, what you’re left with with is the ability to log back in using domain
user accounts (it can’t impact Active Directory accounts) on a cached basis, but your users
are off the network, as an administrator you cannot reach the PC remotely to fix it, and all the
user can do is read the ransom note. They cannot use email, they cannot read a broadcast
from the company on their PC, they cannot work likely as their files are encrypted.
You cannot log in at the physical console to recover the system as you do not know the local
administrator details any more.

12/14

On servers you have service issues, as changing the local administrator passwords can
impact system services using local accounts (such as Microsoft SQL, Sophos etc).

Learning opportunities
Here’s the top ten things I think we can take away from this:

Governments and industry
There is a serious lack of open information sharing after ransomware incidents which involve
unusual code. Right now we’re super protected against, say, WannaCry — but after Altran, a
lack of transparency and openness lead to the same issue elsewhere.
This will happen again with other threats. In my opinion it is in national and international
interests for governments to be informed of technical details of all major business incidents
around malicious code causing outages (e.g. wipers, ransomware) and that information
should be shared with security vendors and other governments. I know many organisations
won’t want to provide this information so governments or regulators might need levers to pull
to compel disclosure.

Companies
Organisations should look at how Hydro disclosed and dealt with the issue so far in the
public arena. It looks like it may be a textbook example of how incident response should be
done, with transparency and openness. Not only the public and media perception went well,
but the business end went well too — people didn’t sell off shares because they felt
genuinely informed and that Hydro had a dire situation under control.

Security industry
I feel the industry could do a better job at advising what benefits and weak spots of their
products have in terms of detection, so customers can make informed choices about where
they may need to introduce additional controls and investment.
I know, I’m naive.
The cyber security industry is currently going through a hype cycle where some vendors are
simply overselling their products — including internally — so you can end up with customers
like Hydro which likely had a reasonable security stack, but got wiped out anyway. Hydro
aren’t alone here in their journey.
I’ve seen vendors talking about Artificial Intelligence made malware — where AI creates the
malware itself — which isn’t even a real thing. The reality here is we had an in the wild,
classic ransomware attack around for months and there wasn’t anywhere approaching good

13/14

detection. Stop talking about blockchain and start detecting.

Detection inside organisations
Your Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) tool should have alerts to detect
excessive addition of new scheduled tasks and/or services. This is not a default alert
I’ve seen in any vendor, and I don’t think it’s a CIS control either. I might write this up
one day.
If you don’t have a SIEM tool, deploy Azure Sentinel. It’s currently free, no
infrastructure, Microsoft managed, and comes with a bucket load of free use cases (it
ships with over a thousand detections) out the box. You can onboard your entire
organisation faster than you can set up a Splunk Heavy Forwarder.
Detect things like Mimikatz and Pass The Hash attacks. Azure Sentinel does this out
the box, no config. If you get your alerts configured right and without false positives (it’s
possible) then jump on them as soon as they go off. Priority -3493289. Make it
monitored 24/7 and on call.
Detect excessive usage of netsh.exe and logoff.exe.
Detect local administrator password changes, particularly on servers.
Detect your endpoint security solutions being stopped and/or disabled.
Enable ‘tamper protection’ in your security products — e.g. in Sophos Endpoint with
Sophos Enterprise Console you need to manually enable , otherwise attackers can
easily just stop Sophos.
Make sure endpoint security products are universally deployed (e.g. via enforced
Group Policy deployment), do not allow IT staff to disable them, and do not allow
policies to be weakened outside change management (e.g. too broad whitelists).
Backup everything.
Have read only backups, too, if you use disk-to-disk.
Have a very heavily defended backup infrastructure. Only the people who access to a
backup server should have access. Take Domain Admins out the Local Administrator
group; make it truly secure.
Keep an eye on infections of Trickbot and Emotet via Office macros.
Keep an eye on infections of Empire Powershell and Cobalt Strike on endpoints and
servers.
Use a service like to monitor your external IP ranges for open RDP servers and other
misconfigurations.
Do not pay the ransom.
Do not pay the ransom.
Do not pay the ransom.
