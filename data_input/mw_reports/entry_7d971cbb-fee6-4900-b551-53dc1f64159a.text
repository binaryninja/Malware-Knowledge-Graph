Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting
Webservers
Introduction
Ryuk is a ransomware that encrypts a victim’s files and requests payment in Bitcoin
cryptocurrency to release the keys used for encryption. Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted
ransomware attacks.
Ryuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises.
Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared
source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for
sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.

information.

To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and
asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt
the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon
payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the
encrypted files to be decrypted.
Because of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to
the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised
credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections.
As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently
observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it.

REPORT

The Ryuk infection chain usually starts with a spear-phishing email with
a malicious URL or an Office document to gain initial entry into victim
environments. In certain cases, compromised RDP computers provide
the initial access. In the first scenario, either Trickbot or BazarLoader
will be executed and used as a loader malware, offering other actors the
opportunity to purchase hacked machines. Once access to the victim’s
machines is acquired by the ransomware actors, a Cobalt Strike beacon is
often downloaded in order to obtain users’ credentials and move laterally
on the network to take over the domain controllers. Finally, the Ryuk binary
is distributed to every machine from the domain controllers.
The main goal of this blog is to deeply analyze the Ryuk binary itself.

General Overview
The analyzed file corresponds to an unpacked ransomware sample from
the Ryuk family.
The sample can be identified by the following hashes:

Anti-debugging Checks
Ryuk repeatedly implements anti-disassembly techniques to make analysis
with static analysis tools more difficult.

Figure 1. Anti-disassembly trick

Likewise, the malicious code will implement anti-debugging techniques
by using the API ZwQueryInformationProcess (T1106 - Native API) along
with various flags such as ProcessDebugFlags, ProcessDebugPort, and
ProcessDebugObjectHandle (T1497.001 System Checks) which will allow
the ransomware to determine if a debugger is present and, if it is, it will
crash itself.

The Ryuk final payload has a size of 148Kb and the compilation date is 30
April 2021 and, while this date could have been manipulated, we believe it is
genuine.
Figure 2. Query process

REPORT

Additionally, the malware will check the BeingDebugged flag (T1497.001
System Checks) from the PEB structure of the process with the same
purpose as stated above.

This process will be responsible for the self-replication to other machines
in the network.

Figure 4. First execution

The second copy of the malware has a randomly generated name and the
suffix “lan.exe” appended. In this case, the malware passes the command
line “8 LAN.” This process will be responsible for sending the Wake On Lan
packets to other computers in the network.

Figure 3. Check if process is being debugged

Execution
Ryuk copies itself three times in the current directory with different names
and launches these new executables with distinct command lines to
execute different functionality in each execution.

Figure 5. Second execution

The third copy follows the same name convention as the second and has
the same command line.

For the first copy of the malware the filename is calculated as a checksum
of the current username and the suffix “r.exe” is appended. If the malware
cannot obtain the username, it will use the default filename “rep.exe.” Also,
when the malware executes the file, it uses the “9 REP” command line.
Figure 6. Execution of third copy

REPORT

Ransom Note
To notify the user about the encryption, Ryuk drops an HTML ransom note
in every folder that it encrypts. This note is remarkably similar to the note
used in other Ryuk variants, with the only difference being the use of a
contact button with some instructions to install the Tor Browser.

Figure 7. HTML Ransom note

When the contact button is clicked, an alert appears with instructions to
contact the ransomware actors.

If we follow the instructions and access the Onion link, we can find the
contact portal with a form asking for an e-mail, password, the name of the
organization, and an area in which to write a message to the actors.

Figure 9. Ryuk contact portal

Change Drive Permissions
The malware will identify the mounted local drives via GetLogicalDrives
API call and for each of them it will change their permissions using the
Windows tool icacls (T1222.001 – Windows File and Directory Permissions
Modification) to grant full access to the drive.

Figure 8. Browser alert with instructions

Figure 10. Icacls execution

Below is an example of the command that Ryuk will execute:
icacls “C:\*” /grant Everyone: F /T /C /Q

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

REPORT

Process and Service Termination
Before starting with the file encryption, the malware will start a new thread
where it will try to finish a list of processes and stop some other services.

To finish the process execution that the malware targets, it uses the
following command:
“C:\Windows\System32\taskkill.exe” /IM <ProcessName> /F

To stop the services that the malware targets, it uses the following
command:
“C:\Windows\System32\net.exe” stop “<ServiceName>” /y

Figure 11. Thread creation

In this new thread, the malware will enumerate the running processes
(T1057 – Process Discovery) and services (T1489 – Service Stop)
and check if the name matches with a list of 41 processes (Appendix
A – Terminated Processes) and 64 services (Appendix B – Terminated
Services) the malware has hardcoded in the sample. Some of these
processes and services belong to AV products, backup services, and
others might be using files which the ransomware targets (T1562.001 –
Disable or Modify Tools).

Figure 12. Thread functions

7

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

Since the services and processes that the malware targets are
checked with the function ‘strstr,’ and this function returns partial
matches of the string, the malware will finish untargeted process like
‘audioendpointbuilder’ because it contains the string ‘endpoint.’

Figure 13. Bogus service stop

REPORT

File Encryption

exe

The malware will try to encrypt both local drives and network drives and
iterate over each file on the drive and check its path and filename (T1083 –
File and Directory Discovery).

.ini

Ryuk does not encrypt files that contain the following names in its full path:
\Windows\
Windows
boot

.lnk
bootmgr
boot
NTDETECT

Also, the malware will verify if the filename contains “index.” and if it is true,
it will call a function we named “RyukDropRansomNoteInIndexFile.”

WINDOWS\
Chrome
Mozilla
SYSVOL
NTDS
netlogon
sysvol

The malware also does not encrypt files if the filename contains any of the
following strings:
RyukReadMe.html
boot
dll
ntldr

8

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

Figure 14. Check index files

REPORT

If the file name contains “.php” it will dynamically create PHP code to
render the HTML ransom note. Otherwise, it will overwrite the file contents
with the HTML ransom note code. With this, the malware ensures that
when someone accesses a website the Ryuk ransom note will appear.

It is believed that this functionality was added to newer versions of the
malware to target web servers and deface public websites with the
Ryuk ransom note. This is a tactic never seen before in the ransomware
landscape and whose final purpose is to pressure victims to pay.
In this later version of Ryuk, the encryption scheme is the same as
previous versions; it uses random AES 256 keys generated with the API
CryptGenKey (T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact) for each file and it
encrypts those keys with the actor’s RSA public key that is hardcoded in
the malware. With this scheme the attackers ensure that the cryptography
and key management are robust.

Figure 16. AES 256 key generation

Figure 15. Drop RYUK ransom note in index files

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

REPORT

Before encrypting a file, the malware will check if it is already encrypted,
searching for the keyword “HERMES” for old Ryuk versions and
“RYUKTM” for recent versions. If it finds those keywords it will close the
handle to file and not encrypt it.

Then, the malware will start encrypting the file in chunks with a defined size
of 1,000,000 bytes.

Figure 18. File chunk encryption

After that, the malware will write the keyword “RYUKTM” to mark the file as
encrypted and will export the AES key encrypted with the RSA public key
using the API CryptExportKey and write it at the end of the file.

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

REPORT

Here is an example of an encrypted file with the 274 bytes of metadata info
appended at the end of file by Ryuk.

Print Task
After the encryption of the files, the malware will create a new scheduled
task (T1053.005 – Scheduled Task) that will print 50 copies of the RTF
ransom note in the default printer configured in the system. The command
line to create this task (T1059.003 – Windows Command Shell) is the
following:
SCHTASKS /CREATE /NP /SC DAILY /TN “PrintvE” /TR “C:\Windows\System32\cmd.
exe /c for /l %x in (1,1,50) do start wordpad.exe /p C:\users\Public\YTKkI.
dll” /ST 10:25 /SD 05/18/2021 /ED 05/25/2021

At a certain time during the week the task would print 50 pages of an RTF
ransom note containing the password dropped in the Public directory with
a random name and the dll extension (T1036 – Masquerading).

Figure 21. Ryuk RTF note
Figure 20. Appended metadata

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

This is also a new functionality added to the malware with the intention
of creating chaos in the victim’s system and pressurizing them to pay the
ransom price to decrypt the files.

REPORT

Wake on Lan
The Ryuk process with the command line “8 LAN” is responsible for
obtaining the ARP cache entries of the system and sending the Wake on
Lan packets to try to turn on the remote computers. To extract the ARP
table, the malware will use the GetIpNetTable API (T1016 – System Network
Configuration Discovery) from the iphlpapi.dll and after retrieving the
previously mentioned table, it will begin to send the packets using the API
sendto from the Winsock library.

The Wake on Lan magic packets (T1205 – Traffic Signaling) are made up
of 6 bytes with the 255 value (0xFF in hexadecimal) followed by sixteen
repetitions of the target computer MAC address for a total of 102 bytes.

Figure 23. Wake on Lan packet

Network Shares Enumeration
Ryuk will also try to move laterally to other hosts in the network, first
obtaining all the IP addresses assigned to the system and checking if
they belong to a private IPv4 addressing range (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x and
192.168.x.x). Because the previously mentioned check is done with the
function strstr, it can match with other public subnets such as 151.192.172.1.

Figure 22. Send Wake on Lan packet

Figure 24. Bug checking private IP networks

12

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

REPORT

If the subnet is one of the above, it will proceed to send ICMP Echo requests
with the API IcmpSendEcho to discover new machines in the subnet (T1135
– Network Share Discovery). If the machine responds to the ping, it will be
considered a potential victim and Ryuk will try to encrypt its files.

SMB Replication
The Ryuk process with the command line “9 REP” will be responsible
for replicating itself into new computers but first it will check for double
executions of the same process creating a mutex object with the name of
the username of the machine (T1082 – System Information Discovery). If
the mutex already exists it will finish the process.

Figure 27. Mutex creation

Figure 25. ICMP Echo request

For each host discovered, Ryuk will attempt to encrypt them using a similar
method to the one used for local drives, by building a UNC path in the
following format for each driver letter, from A to Z:

Next, the malware will check if the file already exists in the remote
computer using the API GetFileAttributesW. The UNC file path will be
constructed on the fly, and it will always try to access the path “C:\Users\
Public” from the remote computer. The filename is created by doing a
checksum of the current username and appending the suffix “r.exe”.T1053

\\<IP>\<drive letter>$

Also, it will try to access and encrypt the following UNC path:
\\<IP>

As can be seen in the following image:

Figure 28. Ryuk file copy

Then, it will use the API CopyFileW to copy the file to the remote computer
and to achieve remote execution it will create a scheduled task with a
random name using the schtasks.exe tool to execute the ransomware copy
(T1021 – Remote Services).

Figure 26. Ryuk UNC file encryption

Therefore, for each compromised remote machine the following two
commands will be executed:
schtasks.exe /Create /S 192.168.56.2 /TN qdpRGwh /TR \”C:\\Users\\Public\\622r.exe\” /sc once /st 00:00 /RL HIGHEST

Defending Against Ryuk with McAfee
Ryuk, like other ransomware, leverages multiple techniques to access the
network and remain persistent before having an impact. In other words,
attacks using ransomware do not start with encryption and therefore you
have multiple opportunities to prevent, disrupt, or detect the malicious
activity. Below is an overview of how you can defend against Ryuk with
McAfee® MVISION™ Security Architecture.

Figure 30. Ryuk Kill Chain
14

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

REPORT

Some best practices to detect or prevent very early in the attack chain
with McAfee® Endpoint Protection and MVISION Unified Cloud Edge can
include:

Initial Access
Endpoint Firewall and Web Control (ENS): Restrict access to necessary
ports and prevent access to web sites with malicious or unknown
reputation.
Endpoint Protection Platform (ENS): Configure both Threat Prevention
and Adaptive Threat Prevention modules for maximum protection
against malware delivered through Spearphishing. In particular, use GTI
in both modules and ensure JTI Rules 4 (GTI File Reputation) and 5 (URL
Reputation) are enabled.

Command and Control
Endpoint Protection Platform (ENS) and MVISION EDR can both identify
Cobalt Strike and other type of command-and-control techniques.
MVISION EDR provides a unified view of endpoint prevention and detection
events so you can speed up triage.
Unified Cloud Edge (UCE – SWG) can prevent access to risky web sites
using threat intelligence, URL reputation, behaviour analysis, and remote
browser isolation. Ensure you have a strong web security policy in place
and are monitoring logs.
More details on specific rules and other defense recommendations can be
found here.

Ryuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers

Conclusion
In this short report we have presented a technical overview of the Ryuk
ransomware and the new functionalities added to the malware used to
increase the damage on the organizations it targets.
It is interesting to note that Ryuk has shifted its attention to webservers
since it no longer encrypts the index file but replaces it with the ransom
note instead. Furthermore, the developers behind Ryuk upgraded the
malware with the ability to print the ransom note in the default printer.
These new functionalities were included to pressure victims into paying the
ransom.
In the first half of the year, several Ryuk actors have been known to be
actively launching new campaigns and targeting organizations all over the
world. This is the reason we believe the criminals behind Ryuk will continue
to develop new features and invent new methods to maximize their profits.
McAfee Advanced Threat Research is actively monitoring this threat,
detected as Ransom-Ryuk![partial-hash], for future releases. Meanwhile,
a solid data loss prevention strategy remains the best advice against
all forms of ransomware; for general prevention advice please visit
NoMoreRansom. Always seek professional assistance when you are faced
with a targeted ransomware attack such as Ryuk.
