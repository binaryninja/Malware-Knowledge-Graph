OCEANLOTUS: OLD TECHNIQUES, NEW BACKDOOR
The OceanLotus group, also known as APT32 and APT-C-00, is infamous for its campaigns targeting
the eastern part of Asia. A great deal of research about this group was published last year, including
papers such as those from CyberReason, a lengthy global view from FireEye and the watering-hole
explanation from Volexity. We see that this group keeps updating their backdoors, infrastructure,
and infection vectors.
OceanLotus continues its activity particularly targeting company and government networks
in East-Asian countries. A few months ago, we discovered and analyzed one of their latest backdoors.
Several tricks are being used to convince the user to execute the backdoor, to slow down its analysis
and to avoid detection. These techniques will be discussed in detail in this blog post.

Distribution
Various methods are used to trick potential victims into running the malicious dropper.
Our telemetry reveals that East-Asian countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos
and Cambodia, are the most targeted.

Double extension and fake icon applications (Word, PDF, etc)
The droppers are probably attached to an email message. Some file names we have seen include:
• Mi17 Technical issues - Phonesack Grp.exe. Mi-17 is a common Russian helicopter.
• Chi tiet don khieu nai gui saigontel.exe, which translates from Vietnamese to
“Details of the complaint sent to Saigontel”. Saigontel is a telecommunication company in
Vietnam.
• Updated AF MOD contract - Jan 2018.exe
• remove_pw_Reschedule of CISD Regular Meeting.exe
• Sorchornor_with_PM_-_Sep_2017.exe
• 20170905-Evaluation Table.xls.exe
• CV_LeHoangThing.doc.exe. Fake résumé (CV) documents were also seen in Canada.
All these files have something in common: A decoy document is launched, but is password-protected.
It’s unclear whether this password is provided by any means, for example in the email it was attached
to, or if the documents are simply not meant to work.

Fake installers
Several fake installers, claiming to be installers or updates for popular software were seen
in watering hole campaigns. A good example of such an installer is the repackaged Firefox installer
described by 360 Labs on Freebuf (Chinese language).
Another sample we saw had the name RobototFontUpdate.exe. It was also likely to have been
distributed via compromised websites, but we do not yet have enough evidence to confirm this.
All the files described here, whether they were sent in an email or downloaded while visiting
a compromised site, deliver the same (functionally equivalent) backdoor component. For the purpose
of this article we will dissect the RobototFontUpdate.exe sample and show how it manages
to execute its malicious payload on a system.

Technical analysis
The whole process of installation and execution relies heavily on multiple layers of obfuscation
such as decryption of payloads, PE reconstruction and loading shellcode, and side-loading techniques.
The last technique was previously described in a previous ESET research article about Korplug.

Execution flow overview
The attack is split in two parts: the dropper and backdoor launcher. Each step of each part
of the process will be explained in detail in its respective section. The following two diagrams briefly
summarize the general flow of execution of the malware.
The dropper part has the following flow of execution:

C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint
Protection\12.1.671.4971.104a\
DeviceAssociationService\

A quick word on control flow obfuscation
Almost all of these components are obfuscated. The obfuscation is based on pairs of complementary
conditional jump instructions. Every form is used: JZ/JNZ, JP/JNP, JO/JNO, etc, each pair jumping
to the same target. The sequence is interleaved with junk code, which makes use of the stack pointer,
but does not change the conditional flag’s value. This means it will always end up in the same branch.
This causes problems during decompilation due to the use of positive stack pointer values.

Figure 3

Complementary conditional jump

OceanLotus
Old techniques, new backdoor

Moreover, some basic blocks push one address on the stack, then end with a JMP/CALL while other
basic blocks push two addresses then end with a RET instruction. The second push is the function
to call and the first one is the address of the next basic block to jump to. This creates basic blocks
with no parents.

Figure 4

PUSH/JMP technique

The resulting combination of these two obfuscation techniques creates “beautiful” graphs:

Figure 5

Control flow obfuscation

The junk code is pretty easy to spot and once the scheme is known, it can be ignored when analysing
the samples.

The Dropper
Stage 1 The decoy document
Over the past few months, a number of decoy documents have been used. One of them was a fake
TrueType font updater for the Roboto Slab regular font. This choice of font seems a bit odd since
it does not support a lot of East-Asian languages.

Figure 6

RobototFontUpdate icon

When executed, this binary decrypts its resource (XOR with a 128-byte, hardcoded key)
and decompresses the decrypted data (LZMA). The legitimate RobotoSlab-Regular.ttf
(SHA1:912895e6bb9e05af3a1e58a1da417e992a71a324) file is written into the %temp% folder
and run via Win32 API function ShellExecute.

9

OceanLotus
Old techniques, new backdoor

The shellcode decrypted from the resource is executed. After its execution, the fake font updater
drops another application whose sole purpose is to delete the dropper. This “eraser” application
is dropped as %temp%\[0-9].tmp.exe.

Stage 2 The shellcode
The shellcode used is the same for every stage that uses shellcode
The shellcode is a custom PE loader. It recreates an executable in memory: it decrypts all the sections
and computes the necessary relocations and other offsets. The shellcode retrieves three Windows
API functions: VirtualAlloc, RtlMoveMemory and RtlZeroMemory.
The RtlZeroMemory function is heavily used to zero-out fields in the PE header. Relying
on automatic memory dumping will not work since the MZ/PE headers are broken.
The shellcode calls the entry-point function of the decrypted PE and then the DLLEntry
export function.

Stage 3 Real Dropper, {103004A5-829C-418E-ACE9-A7615D30E125}.dll
This executable decrypts its resource using the AES algorithm with CBC mode via the Windows
API. The size of the hardcoded key is 256 bits. After decryption, the data are decompressed (LZMA
algorithm).
If the process is running with administrator privileges, then the malware achieves persistence by
creating a service, else the classic Windows “Run” registry key is used (HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\
Windows\CurrentVersion\Run;DeviceAssociationService;rastlsc.exe).
If the dropper is executed with administrator privileges, then it tries to write the following files in
the C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\12.1.671.4971.104a\
DeviceAssociationService\ folder else it writes them in the %APPDATA%\Symantec\Symantec
Endpoint Protection\12.1.671.4971.104a\DeviceAssociationService\ folder:
• rastlsc.exe (SHA1:2616da1697f7c764ee7fb558887a6a3279861fac, copy of legitimate
Symantec Network Access Control application, dot1xtra.exe)
• SyLog.bin (SHA1:5689448b4b6260ec9c35f129df8b8f2622c66a45, encrypted backdoor)
• rastls.dll (SHA1:82e579bd49d69845133c9aa8585f8bd26736437b,malicious DLL sideloaded by rastlsc.exe)
The path changes from sample to sample but the pattern is similar. Depending on its privileges, the
malware drops the files in %ProgramFiles% or %appdata%. We’ve also seen:
• \Symantec\CNG Key Isolation\
• \Symantec\Connected User Experiences and Telemetry\
• \Symantec\DevQuery Background Discovery Broker Tasks\
These paths are used by various Symantec products.
After achieving persistence and dropping the executable, the legitimate Symantec executable,
rastlsc.exe, is executed using CreateProcessW.
We’ve also seen another version ({BB7BDEC9-B59D-492E-A4AF-4C7B1C9E646B}.dll),
which executes rastlsc.exe with the parameter krv. Its meaning is discussed below.

Backdoor component: rastlsc.exe side-loading
The OceanLotus group uses an old and publicly known technique on one of the Symantec product’s
executable files. The trick, here, is to take advantage of the library loading process of a legitimate
and signed executable by writing a malicious library inside the same folder. This way it will make
malicious behaviors look legitimate because these actions are made by the trusted executable process.
As mentioned earlier, the legitimate executable rastlsc.exe is dropped and executed.
This executable imports the rastls.dll file, which in this case contains the malicious payload.

Figure 7

Symantec rastlsc.exe digital signature

Side loading was also observed using other legitimate, signed executables including mcoemcpy.exe
from McAfee, which loads McUtil.dll. This technique has also been used by PlugX before. This also
got the attention of the Vietnam CERT (Vietnamese language).

Stage 1 Library side-loading, rastls.dll
The internal name of this dll is {7032F494-0562-4422-9C39-14230E095C52}.dll but we’ve seen
other versions like {5248F13C-85F0-42DF-860D-1723EEAA4F90}.dll. All exported functions lead
to the execution of the same function.

11

OceanLotus
Old techniques, new backdoor

Figure 8

All rasltls.dll exports lead to the same function

This export tries to read the SyLog.bin file located inside the same folder. Other versions tried
to open the file OUTLFLTR.DAT. If that file exists, it is decrypted using AES in CBC mode with
a hardcoded, 256-bit key and then decompressed (LZMA compression).
The McUtil.dll variant uses a different technique. At first glance, it looks as if like the main function
does nothing malicious, but in fact it replaces the .text section of the legitimate mcoemcpy.exe,
a side-loaded binary. It generates shellcode whose purpose is to call the function reading the encrypted
stage-two shellcode in the mcscentr.adf file.

The following pseudocode is used to create the shellcode:

x = False
i = 0
buff = genRandom()
opc1 = [0x58,0x59,0x5a,0x5b]
opc2 = [0x50,0x51,0x52,0x53,0x54,0x55,0x56,0x57]
opc3 = [0x90,0x40,0x41,0x42,0x43,0x44,0x45,0x46,0x47,0x48,

		 0x49,0x4a,0x4b]
while i < len(buff):
		currentChar = buff[i]
		if currentChar < 0xc8:
				buff[i] = opc1[currentChar % len(opc1)]
		else:
				if x:
						buff[i] = opc2[currentChar % len(opc2)]
				else:
						buff[i] = opc3[currentChar % len(opc3)]
				x = x == False
		i+=1

The result is the following assembly listing:

Figure 9

Generated shellcode

Stage 2 to Stage 4 Shellcode, Launcher and Shellcode again
The shellcode decrypts and loads the library {E1E4CBED-5690-4749-819D-24FB660DF55F}.dll.
The library retrieves its resource and tries to start the service “DeviceAssociationService”.
The decrypted data also contains shellcode. The latter decrypts the final layer: the backdoor.

13

OceanLotus

The variant {92BA1818-0119-4F79-874E-E3BF79C355B8}.dll checks whether rastlsc.exe
was executed with krv as the first parameter. If so, then a job is created and rastlsc.exe
is executed again, but without the parameter.

Stage 5 The backdoor, {A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}.dll
The malware first tries to retrieve its resource and decrypt it using RC4. The decrypted resource
contains an interesting piece of information, used to configure the backdoor. The format of this
configuration is straightforward to reverse. Using Kaitai struct and its structure dumper,
the following representation can be displayed:

Figure 10

Configuration structure

NOTES: except for the string domain_encoding_str and the httpprov library, all these data
change from one sample to another. The registry keys are almost the same but they follow a similar pattern:
\HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppX[a-f0-9]{32}, which is quite generic.
The malware retrieves the first 10 bytes of the username (UTF-16), XORs it with the 3-letter
UTF-16 mutex_encoding_str string, and encodes it in hex. The result is used as a mutex name.
For instance, for a user whose name starts with abc and the key being vwx, the following mutex
will be created: \Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\170015001b.
The backdoor includes a PE loader that loads the library HTTPProv.dll in memory, calls its entrypoint and then calls the export function named CreateInstance.

14

OceanLotus
Old techniques, new backdoor

Communication
The backdoor uses a classic TCP communication protocol over port 25123. In order to retrieve
the server IP address, the backdoor first creates a particular DNS query.
The malware chooses between one of the three domains from the configuration and adds a custom
sub-domain generated using two values. The first value is the computer name up to a length
of 16 bytes. The second value is the 4-byte version ID. The following Python 2 code implements
the encoding algorithm :

letters=domain_encoding_str # “ghijklmnop”
hex_pc_name=pc_name.encode(“UTF-16LE”).encode(“hex”)
s=’’
for c in hex_pc_name:
if 0x2f < ord(c) < 0x3a:
		s+=letters[ord(c) - 0x30]
else:
		s+=c

For instance, if the computer name is random-pc and the version ID is 0x0a841523 then the following
domain could be created:
niggmhggmeggmkggmfggmdggidggngggmjgg.ijhlokga.dwarduong[.]com
The following regular expression could be used to flag a C&C server for this backdoor:
[ghijklmnopabcdef]{4-60}\.[ghijklmnopabcdef]{8}\.[a-z]+\.[a-z]+
If an IP address is resolved for this particular domain, then the malware tries to establish a
connection on TCP port 25123. Each sample has three different domain names it can use to find its
C&C server.
All communication is encrypted using RC4 and compressed with LZMA. It is possible to decrypt the
traffic because the key is prepended to the packets. The format is:
[RC4 key (4 bytes)][encrypted data]
Each byte of the key is generated using the rand function. Once the packet is decrypted and
decompressed, the data follow the format:
[dw:unknown][dw:unknown][dw:command number][dw:size of data][dw:unknown]
[dw:data]
The first time the client connects to the server, a UUID is returned and used as a session
ID. The latter is stored in the registry key as binary data: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\
AppXc52346ec40fb4061ad96be0e6cb7d16a\DefaultIcon
As mentioned earlier, the backdoor also contains a library called HTTPprov. This library is an
alternative way, as a backup, to communicate with the server as a backup. This DLL sends a POST
request over the HTTP protocol to communicate. It also supports HTTPS and the usage of a SOCKS5,
SOCKS4a or SOCKS4 proxy. The library is statically linked with libcurl.
Once its initialization is done, the following registry key is created to instruct the backdoor
to use HTTP in future communication with the C&C server: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\
CLSID{E3517E26-8E93-458D-A6DF-8030BC80528B}.
A generic user agent is used: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0;
Trident/4.0).

OceanLotus
Old techniques, new backdoor

The most distinctive characteristic of this library is the custom URI encoding algorithm. The resource
part of the URI is created using the following pseudocode:

buffEnd = ((DWORD)genRand(4) % 20) + 10 + buff;
while (buff < buffEnd){
		b=genRand(16);
		if (b[0] - 0x50 > 0x50)
				t=0;
		else
				*buf++= UPPER(vowels[b[1] % 5]);
		v=consonants[b[1]%21]);
		if (!t)
				v=UPPER(v);
		*buff++= v;
		if (v!=’h’ && b[2] - 0x50 < 0x50)
				*buff++= ‘h’;
		*buff++= vowels[b[4] % 5];
		if (b[5] < 0x60)
				*buff++= vowels[b[6] % 5];
		*buff++= consonants[b[7] % 21];
		if (b[8] < 0x50)
				*buff++= vowels[b[9] % 5];
		*buff++= ‘-’;

};
*buff=’\0’;

NOTE: For clarity, the length-checking part has been removed from the snippet.
From this generated string, two numbers are computed based on the custom checksum to obtain a URI:

checksum=crc32(buff)
num2=(checksum >> 16) + (checksum & 0xffff) * 2
num1=(num2 ^ 1) & 0xf
URL=GENERATED_DOMAIN+ “/” + num1 + “/” + num2 + “-” + buff

By adding the URI generator of the HTTPprov library, the following URL could be generated:
hXXp://niggmhggmeggmkggmfggmdggidggngggmjgg.ijhlokga.aisicoin[.]com/
13/139756-Ses-Ufali-L

CONCLUSION
Once again, OceanLotus shows that the team is active and continues to update its toolset.
This also demonstrates its intention to remain hidden by picking its targets, limiting the distribution
of their malware and using several different servers to avoid attracting attention to a single domain
or IP address. The encryption of the payload, together with the side-loading technique – despite
its age – is a good way to stay under the radar, since the malicious activities look like they come
from the legitimate application.
