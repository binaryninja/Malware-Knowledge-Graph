April 15, 2021 Selena Larson
On 30 March 2021, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a security alert
detailing an ongoing email-based IRS impersonation campaign primarily targeting
educational institutions. Impacted people included university and college students and
staffers using “.edu” email addresses.
Educational institutions are not the only organizations that financially motivated threat actors
have set their sights on using tax-themed lures. Proofpoint observed similar threats
impacting dozens of verticals from manufacturing to healthcare to energy. But this year is a
bit different. Threat actors take advantage of every tax season by mounting tax-themed
campaigns that aim to steal money and sensitive information. What makes 2021 unique are
the continuing and unprecedented pandemic, healthcare, and financial crises that these
threat actors are combining with typical tax lures in the ongoing campaigns Proofpoint
observed.
These findings demonstrate threat actors are agile and flexible and take current events into
account in their campaign development to maximize their advantage and encourage victims
to fall for their tactics.
Proofpoint observed over 30 tax-themed malicious email campaigns totaling over 800,000
email messages so far in 2021. These include attempts to compromise personal email
accounts or steal sensitive personal data for likely financial gain. Proofpoint also observed
multiple campaigns aligned with business email compromise activities. Such attacks can be
used to facilitate payroll fraud, costing victim organizations millions of dollars.
Campaign Trends
So far in 2021, Proofpoint identified over 30 discrete campaigns targeting thousands of
people from multiple threat actors that leveraged malicious email lures associated with taxes,
tax and refund support, and government revenue entities. At least four threat actor groups
tracked by Proofpoint have leveraged tax-themed malicious email campaigns.

3/10

Credential theft phishing attempts – which can be used to target individuals or leveraged for
email account takeovers – accounted for 40% of the tax-themed email campaigns, followed
by remote access trojan (RAT) campaigns at 17%. However, despite RATs featuring in fewer
campaigns, they were far more popular in total message volume. Half of identified taxthemed and related messages containing malware were used to distribute the Remcos RAT,
a commodity malware with extensive data theft and surveillance capabilities. Other broad
tax-themed malware distribution campaigns included Dridex, TrickBot, and ZLoader.
Over the course of 2020, threat actors began increasingly leveraging Excel 4.0 (XL4) macros
to distribute malware, and this trend has continued in 2021. Proofpoint observed a 500%
increase in tax-themed email threat campaigns delivering weaponized XL4 Macros in the first
three months of 2021. Proofpoint assesses this is due to limited detection coverage in
modern security systems. (Although Microsoft still supports XL4 macros, the company
suggests migrating them to the latest version of Microsoft Visual Basic Application.)
Campaign Samples
TrickBot
One of the most prolific IRS-themed malware campaigns leveraged IRS tax credit distribution
for employee retention lures benefiting employers impacted by COVID-19. This campaign
identified in March 2021 contained over 18,000 messages to over 2,000 target entities. It
distributed the TrickBot banking trojan. TrickBot is designed to steal banking information and
acts as an initial payload for additional malware, gaining notoriety in 2018 for distributing
Ryuk ransomware which reportedly accounted for a third of ransomware distributed by many
actors across the threat landscape in 2020.

Unlike typically observed activity, this TrickBot campaign distributed malicious Excel files
leveraging the XLSB filetype, a lightweight file format that can only be opened in Excel.
Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence the threat actor leveraged this document
format as it is less likely to be detected by anti-virus systems. Researchers previously
observed the multipurpose trojan QBot distributed via XLSB files in October 2020.
Dridex
The threat actor Proofpoint tracks as TA575 distributed emails purporting to be from IRS
representatives associated with the American Rescue Plan. The emails contained links to
download Microsoft Excel documents containing macros that, when enabled, downloaded
the Dridex malware designed to steal banking and other personal information.
Also known as the COVID-19 Stimulus Package, the American Rescue Plan, was signed into
law on 11 March 2021. The $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package aimed to provide
financial relief to people and businesses in the U.S.

The TA575 campaign, which began in early March, included almost 16,000 messages and
impacted over 1,800 organizations across dozens of verticals.
Consumer Credential Phishing
Tax-themed phishing attacks also occur globally, and one campaign Proofpoint identified
posed as the United Kingdom’s tax and customs authority, HM Revenue and Customs
(HMRC). As part of the country’s COVID-19 response, HMRC introduced multiple SelfEmployment Income Support Schemes allowing people financially impacted by the pandemic
to claim financial aid.
The malicious email campaign that began in mid-February 2021 distributed messages with
links that led to a fake Self-Employment HMRC tax themed authentication page designed to
harvest user credentials.

TA574
Typical IRS-themed lures remain popular. The cybercrime actor TA574 sent almost 40,000
messages in one campaign using lures posing as the IRS and financial representatives.
TA574 is an actor operating at a large scale that indiscriminately targets multiple industries
and attempts to deliver and install malware like banking trojans. The IRS-themed emails
contained malicious Microsoft Excel documents that requested victims enable macros to
view content, thereby downloading and executing the ZLoader malware on a victim machine.
ZLoader is a typical banking malware that steals credentials and other private
information from users of targeted financial institutions.

New Client Tax Lures
One small campaign identified in March 2021 leverages subjects purporting to be requests
from new clients or tax filing assistance. The emails begin with a benign request for tax
preparation assistance from "John Stevens" and his wife. The emails target financial and
accounting organizations in North America. If the recipient replies, they then receive a follow
up email with a URL linking to a document that uses macros to drop a downloader that pulls
in NetWire RAT. NetWire is typically used by criminal threat actors targeting a wide range of
organizations including financial services, businesses, medical companies, and educational
institutions.

Proofpoint researchers observed similar campaigns since 2018. Proofpoint assesses with
high confidence the same threat actor is responsible for these campaigns. This actor targets
accounting, financial, and related industries typically around tax season.
Conclusion
Tax season is a popular time for threat actors to conduct email-based attack campaigns
designed to steal sensitive information for financial gain. In 2021, threat actors are often
combining current events such as COVID-19 or healthcare themes alongside typical tax
lures to further entice victims.
To reduce the risk of successful exploitation, Proofpoint recommends the following:

9/10

Train users to spot and report malicious email. Regular training and simulated
attacks can stop many attacks and help identify people who are especially vulnerable.
The best simulations mimic real-world attack techniques. Look for solutions that tie into
real-world attack trends and the latest threat intelligence.
At the same time, assume that users will eventually click some threats. Attackers
will always find new ways to exploit human nature. Find a solution that spots and
blocks inbound email threats targeting employees before they reach the inbox. Invest in
a solution can manage the entire spectrum of email threats, not just malware-based
threats. Some threats—including business email compromise (BEC) and other forms of
email fraud—can be hard to detect with conventional security tools. Your solution
should analyze both external and internal email—attackers may use compromised
accounts to trick users within the same organization. Web isolation can be a critical
safeguard for unknows and risky URLs.
Manage access to sensitive data and insider threats. A cloud access security
broker can help secure cloud accounts and help you grant the right levels of access to
users and third-party add-on apps based on the risk factors that matter to you. Insider
risk management platforms can help protect against insider threats, including users
compromised by external attacks.
Partner with a threat intelligence vendor. Focused, targeted attacks call for
advanced threat intelligence. Leverage a solution that combines static and dynamic
techniques at scale to detect new attack tools, tactics, and targets—and then learns
from them.
