After Big Takedown Efforts, 20 More BankBot Mobile Malware Apps Make It Into Google Play

A flashlight app, fake videos or a fake gaming app? Any one of those could be malicious and
harboring a mobile malware app, right there in a trusted official app store. In an ongoing
trend, IBM X-Force noted that malicious apps manage to circumvent controls and infiltrate
legitimate stores. And this is not about the plethora of adware apps infecting users in the app
stores, which has almost become the norm, but rather that banking malware is now turning
into somewhat of a resident in Google Play.
BankBot is one of the mobile banking Trojans that has taken to the Play store in the past few
months, managing to get through in the guise of widgets and benign apps. After the
discovery and takedown of these apps — hundreds of them, to be exact — it seems that
BankBot still finds ways to get in and infect unwitting users.
In a recent discovery, IBM X-Force mobile researchers identified at least 20 different
malicious Android apps that made it into Google’s Play store delivering BankBot.
Landing a place in official app stores is both effective and profitable for cybercriminals who
operate mobile malware. For one, they do not have to invest in the distribution of the
malware. They can save on costs associated with spam lists, SMS messaging or sending
mass emails, not knowing who would eventually click and bother fetching the app from a
third-party store — provided they’ve already enabled side-loading. It’s a longer shot.
Second, malicious apps will get all that much more exposure in an official store, where
hundreds of millions of people search for apps daily. Botnets are always a numbers game.
Beyond sheer traffic, malware that makes it into the official stores enjoys the trust factor that
comes with downloading an app from a legitimate source, likely leading to more app
permissions being granted to malicious applications.

A Dangerous, Rising Trend
Bad Android apps making it into the official app store is not new by any means. It appears
that criminals manage to find their way into legitimate stores, concealing their malware or
including it in app updates that comes later on.
The rising trend is this: While adware and other nuisance apps have been making in into
official app stores for the past few years, now we are seeing banking malware increasingly
showing up in those trusted download sources. This trend is extremely problematic because
it introduces an entirely different threat level to the users of official stores, making them
download a mobile banking Trojan, which can inevitably lead to a significant rise in fraudulent
financial activity in the weeks and months following the installation.

BankBot — In Store and Ready for Fraud
The BankBot malware emerged in January 2017, initially identified in the wild as
Android.BankBot.149, go_p00t, and later named BankBot and Mazain. In essence, all these
malware names relate to the same code base that was leaked soon after it was discovered.
According to X-Force research, BankBot affects only Android-based mobile devices at this
time. It is part of the overlay class of mobile banking Trojans, which uses fake activity
screens on top of legitimate apps to lure users into divulging their banking and payment card
credentials. BankBot is geared toward financial fraud, and used by cybercriminals to commit
identity theft, account takeover and spamming of the malware to additional devices.
In April 2017, IBM X-Force researchers observed this malware use another notable manner
to get into the official Play store. It started out as a benign application purporting to display
funny videos. After downloading and executing it, the app would update itself, fetching and
installing malware modules into the original application. This effectively turned the once
benign app into a mobile banking malware complete with permissions and persistency on the
device.

BankBot’s Fraud M.O.
Before mobile malware, cybercriminals looking to take over bank accounts for fraudulent
transactions would run into SMS-based two-factor authentication and get stuck.
Those launching phishing attacks saw their attack capabilities quickly decline as more banks
adopted out-of-band authentication challenges. To bypass this authentication method, they
started writing SMS hijackers, convincing infected PC owners to download those apps to

their smartphones. This social engineering worked for a while, but it required resources and
a very convincing ploy to make victims enable side-loading and get the malicious app from a
third-party store.
This is where mobile banking Trojans such as BankBot came in. They are a one-stop shop
for authentication elements cybercriminals typically use to take over an account. The
following is the takeover flow for criminals using malware like BankBot.

It’s important to note that the infection begins on a mobile device, usually unbeknownst to the
common user. When the fraud attempt eventually takes place, it happens from an entirely
different device. The attacker uses his or her own endpoint to access the victim’s bank’s
website to initiate the fraudulent transaction, and the user will not always logically connect
the dots and realize the two are linked.

When victims see their phones locked with a fake update message displayed by BankBot,
they may think that there’s a technical issue. They could reach out to a local mobile repair
shop or call their service provider to ask about it. Even if they do realize they’ve been hit by
malware, it’s difficult to know what sort of malware and know that their bank account, and
sometimes payment cards, have most likely been compromised at that point.
What makes this worse is that the malware prevents victims from receiving calls, and so
prevents banks from being able to contact them about the suspicious transaction. By often
resorting to a factory reset, victims unfortunately eliminate forensic information that can be
useful for identification and analysis of the infection.
According to X-Force research, BankBot variants have been actively targeting banks in
Spain and in France in July 2017. BankBot and the M.O. described in this post were
detected and thwarted by IBM Trusteer Mobile SDK. The account takeover phase was
detected with holistic cross-channel detection capabilities provided by IBM Trusteer Pinpoint
Detect.

Additionally, recent BankBot target lists include banks in Australia, Germany and Romania.
X-Force research noted that BankBot is an overlay Android bot. It monitors for the launch of
targeted banking applications on the infected device and then dynamically fetches a
matching HTML overlay from its controller’s server. The overlay is presented to users, hiding
the original app they may have opened and requesting their online banking credentials,
credit card details or login combination. Once entered, the malware sends the details to the
attacker in cleartext.
Upon installation, this malware requests app administrator privileges on the device under the
guise of a system update. Once installed, the application icon disappears, but the app
continues to run in the background. BankBot will not operate if it detects that the infected
5/12

device is located in CIS countries, alluding to its possible operator’s whereabouts.
BankBot can lock the device’s screen to keep the user out when it is performing fraudulent
activity on the victim’s account; to do so, it displays a fake update message on screen to
delay access attempts to the device. The malware further possesses data exfiltration
capabilities that enable it to hijack incoming SMS messages and forward them to the
attacker, thus compromising SMS-based two-factor authentication.
Since it is commercially available in underground forums and code-sharing sites, BankBot
targets include a long list of banks across Europe, especially in Spain, Australia, New
Zealand and some banks in Argentina. In some cases, the malware targets both Android
smartphone and Android tablet versions of the banking apps it is after, depending on the
botnet’s operator’s goals.

More to Come?
According to ongoing research by X-Force, mobile malware has been rising in sophistication
in the past few years, making it less surprising to see its operators manage to circumvent
automated security controls on legitimate app stores.
With various code leaks in the mobile malware scene, the number of malicious actors has
also been steadily growing — especially since unlike PC botnets, mobile malware does not
require a high level of technical savvy. Together, these factors make for a continually rising
threat that now reaches more users than ever, turning them into potential fraud victims.
