Cyber operations and the Russian intelligence services
Russia is one of the world’s most prolific cyber actors and dedicate significant resource into conducting cyber operations
around the globe. The UK government has publicly attributed malign cyber activity to parts of three Russian Intelligence
services: the FSB, SVR and GRU, with each having their own remits.
A table of the parts of the Russian Intelligence Services that the UK Government has publicly attributed is below.

The FSB cyber programme
The FSB (Federal Security Service; Russian: (Федеральная служба безопасности (ФСБ)) is Russia’s state security agency
and the successor to the KGB. Since its formation in (1995 the FSB has conducted electronic surveillance of equipment.

FSB Centre 16
FSB Centre 16 (16-й Центр) is responsible for cyber operations including the intercepting, decrypting and processing of
electronic messages, and the technical penetration of foreign targets. Its full title is the Centre for Radio-Electronic
Intelligence by Means of Communication (TsRRSS; Russian: Центр радиоэлектронной разведки на средствах связи
(ЦPPCC)) and is also known as “Military Unit 71330” (V/Ch 71330) (Bойсковая часть B/Ч 71330).
When the KGB was disbanded in 1991, the 16th Directorate of the KGB became FAPSI (Russian: ՓАПϹИ) or Federal
Agency of Government Communications and Information (FAGCI) (Russian :Փедеральное Агентство Правительственной
Ϲвязи и Информации), a Russian government agency, which was responsible for signals intelligence (SIGINT) and security

of governmental communications.
In 2003, FAPSI was dissolved, and the 3rd Main Department of FAPSI (responsible for SIGINT) was transferred to the FSB
forming the basis for FSB Centre 16.
The emblem of FSB Centre 16 hints at its activities in cyberspace: a satellite dish (signifying SIGINT activity) and a key,
broken by lightning, (signifying the breaking of an encryption key) are both present.

Cyber operations conducted by FSB Centre 16
FSB Centre 16 has been observed conducting cyber operations since at least 2010. They conducted significant campaigns
against the energy sector in 2014 and the aviation sector in 2020.

Cyber operations against worldwide critical national infrastructure
Centre 16 of the FSB have targeted/gained unauthorised access systems in countries around the world that are necessary for
a country to function and upon which daily life depends. Known as Critical National Infrastructure or CNI, Centre 16 has
targeted systems essential for energy, healthcare, finance, education and local/national governments. This has been a
concerted campaign over many years and in a wide range of countries across Europe, the Americas and Asia.
NCSC and cyber security companies have warned network defenders on multiple occasions of the risks posed by this pattern
of activity. While there has been speculation of FSB involvement, the UK government is confirming this activity was carried
out by FSB Centre 16 and providing further details of specific examples of this activity to increase awareness and
transparency around the threat.
