EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides a summary of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center (NCCIC)/Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) vulnerability coordination activities for FY 2015.
The goal of ICS-CERT is to reduce industrial control systems (ICS) risks
within and across all critical infrastructure sectors by coordinating efforts
among Federal, state, local, and tribal governments, as well as industrial
control systems owners, operators, and vendors. ICS-CERT coordinates
activities to reduce the likelihood of success and the severity of the impact
of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure control systems.
This report provides trend analysis for all vulnerabilities reported to
ICS-CERT in FY 2015. Most notably, researchers found that 52 percent
came from improper input validation and permissions, privileges, and
access controls. While this high percentage may indicate a pressing cybersecurity gap, it is also possible that it merely reflects the type of vu nerabilities targeted by researchers reporting to ICS-CERT. The majority
of reported vulnerabilities for FY 2015 came from the Energy, Critical
Manufacturing, and Water and Wastewater Sectors.

SCOPE

The intent and scope of this report is to provide a summary of the Department of Homeland
Security’s (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) / Industrial
Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) vulnerability coordination efforts
performed in FY 2015.

2.

ICS-CERT VULNERABILITY HANDLING PROCESS

The ICS-CERT vulnerability handling process involves five basic steps:
1.

Detection and Collection: ICS-CERT obtains vulnerability information in three ways: ICS-CERT
vulnerability analysis, monitoring public sources of vulnerability information, and direct notification of vulnerabilities to ICS-CERT by vendors and independent security researchers. After
receiving a report, ICS-CERT will perform an initial surface analysis in order to eliminate duplicate reports and false alarms. ICS-CERT then combines and catalogs the remaining vulnerability
reports with all private and publicly available information.

2.

Analysis: Once ICS-CERT has catalogued the vulnerabilities, vendor and ICS-CERT analysts
work to understand the vulnerabilities by examining and identifying the issues, as well as the
potential threat.

3.

Mitigation Coordination: After validating a reported vulnerability, ICS-CERT will continue to
work with the vendor on mitigation, including possible patch issuance. Researchers then have the
opportunity to validate solutions prior to publication.

4.

Application of Mitigation: ICS-CERT will work with the vendor to allow sufficient time for end
users to obtain, test, and apply mitigation strategies prior to disclosure. This time window is variable depending on the circumstances of the vulnerability and the impact to critical infrastructure.

5.

Disclosure: After gathering the technical and threat information related to the vulnerability,
ICS-CERT will notify asset owners about the vulnerability through the publication of an
ICS-CERT advisory.

ICS-CERT attempts to coordinate all reported vulnerabilities with the associated vendor. While the
goal of ICS-CERT efforts is the timely sharing of vulnerability information, a number of factors may
affect the schedule of disclosure. These factors may include the following:

• The severity of the vulnerability,
• Its potential impact to critical infrastructure, public health, and safety,
• The availability of immediate mitigations,
• Whether the information has already been publicly released, and
• The vendor’s estimation of time required for the creation, test, and application of a
patch or upgrade.
In cases where a vendor is unresponsive, or will not establish a reasonable timeframe for remediation,
ICS-CERT may disclose vulnerabilities, regardless of the existence or availability of patches or workarounds from the associated vendors.

VULNERABILITY COORDINATION METRICS

This section provides additional detail regarding the development and improvement of ICS-CERT
capabilities in FY 2015, including total vulnerability reports, key researchers, and time from vulnerability
identification to the successful closure of vulnerability reports.

3.1 Vulnerability Reporting and Resolution
ICS-CERT receives vulnerability reports from vulnerability researchers, industrial control system
(ICS) vendors, and national Computer Emergency Readiness Team’s (CERT). ICS-CERT opens a ticket
when someone reports a vulnerability. ICS-CERT serves as the facilitator between vulnerability researchers and the associated vendor. After the opening of a ticket, vendors will typically validate the vulnerability and create a patch or other mitigations, which the researcher may then validate. After validation of the
mitigation, vendors will distribute the patch to their customers. ICS-CERT will not release an advisory
describing the vulnerability until after the vendor’s customers have been given time to patch their systems
(this period is known as a “patch window”). If appropriate, ICS-CERT will publish an alert before the
vendor has released a mitigation. For example, if someone has already released information about the vulnerability ICS-CERT will publish an alert before the patch window. After a patch window has expired or,
alternatively, if it is evident that the vendor will not provide mitigation, the ticket is closed (“resolved”).
Advisories provide timely information about current security issues, vulnerabilities, and exploits. An
ICS-CERT advisory is intended to provide awareness to or solicit feedback from critical infrastructure
owners and operators concerning ongoing cyber events or activities with the potential to impact critical
infrastructure computing networks. An advisory contains information from the researcher’s initial report,
validation of the vulnerability, a description of the vulnerability including exploitation impact, and mitigations steps that asset owners can apply. ICS-CERT issues an advisory after the vulnerability coordination
process has occurred. This means the researcher has contacted ICS-CERT before issuing a public notific tion of their findings.
ICS-CERT intends for its alerts to provide timely notification to critical infrastructure owners and
operators concerning threats or activity with the potential to impact critical infrastructure computing
networks. ICS-CERT produces alerts based on a vulnerability discovery and the vendor’s validation and
uses them to rapidly disseminate information about a vulnerability that someone has publicly released
without coordination.
In 2015, ICS-CERT produced 197 advisories with 22 initially published to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Portal and 16 alerts with four initially published to the Portal.
Figure 1 shows the number of alerts and advisories published by ICS-CERT from FY 2010 through FY
2015, and Figure 2 shows the number of tickets resolved for the same period.

Figure 2. Number of tickets created and resolved by ICS-CERT from FY 2010 through FY 2015.
The increase in the number of vulnerabilities reported is significantly la ger than the tickets created.
The disparity is a result of researchers conducting an in-depth assessment prior to submitting a vulnerability report. In the course of its work, ICS-CERT may create tickets that it later merges or eliminates because of issues of applicability. Figure 3 shows the number of ICS vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT
in FY 2015.

Independent researchers report vulnerabilities directly to ICS-CERT, which helps coordinate communications between the researcher and vendor. As previously mentioned, ICS-CERT will not publish
an advisory with vulnerability details until the vendor has released a fix to its customers. The following
figures display the length of time from when ICS vendors received notification of vulnerabilities unti
their tickets were resolved (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Length of time for ticket resolution.
One of the main goals for 2015 was to reduce the number of tickets that had been open for longer
than 365 days. The Vulnerability Coordination Team closed 35 tickets older than 365 days in FY 2015.
This represents 76 percent of the tickets open for over 365 days. This success is attributable to elevating
the visibility of the vulnerability to the vendor’s management level.

3.1.1 Coordinated Disclosure Trends
Some vulnerability researchers publish vulnerabilities without giving the vendor a chance to provide
mitigation to its customers. The general trend, however, is that more ICS vulnerability researchers are
waiting to publish vulnerabilities that could impact critical infrastructure until the vendor has had an opportunity to mitigate them. Figure 5 shows the percentage of vulnerabilities coordinated with ICS-CERT
from FY 2010 to FY 2015.

3.1.2 Researcher Trends
Independent vulnerability researchers report most ICS vulnerabilities to ICS-CERT, although some
report to third-party collaborators, such as the Zero Day Initiative. In addition, ICS-CERT collaborates
with international and private sector CERTs, such as the Japan CERT, ICST (Taiwan National Information and Communication Taskforce), and Siemens ProductCERT. The vulnerability researchers who have
reported the most vulnerabilities in FY 2015 to the ICS-CERT are listed below:

• Rupp, Maxim

Only three independent researchers from previous years have submitted vulnerabilities in FY 2015:

• Rios, Billy;
• Crain, Adam; and
• Brown, Jeremy.

Some ICS vendors have identified and self-reported vulnerabilities in their own products. The following vendors are ranked in order of vulnerabilities they self-reported in FY 2015:
1.

Siemens ProductCERT,

2.

GE,

3.

Schneider Electric, and

4.

OSIsoft.

SEVERITY OF ICS VULNERABILITIES

The security industry standard for scoring the severity of a vulnerability is the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS). ICS-CERT gives vulnerabilities a CVSS score to help asset owners assess the
risk a given vulnerability poses to their organization. Figure 8 shows the percentage of ICS vulnerabilities
with low, medium, and high CVSS scores. Figure 7 shows that the average CVSS scores reported to
ICS-CERT dropped from 8.50 in FY 2010 to 6.85 at the end of FY 2015.

Severity of ICS Vulnerabilities

TYPES OF VULNERABILITIES REPORTED TO ICS-CERT

Figure 9 shows high-level categories of all vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT for FY 2010 through
FY 2015. The changes from previous years show an increase in all types with the exception of improper
input validation.
Improper input validation vulnerabilities occur when software does not validate input properly;
an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This can
lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flo , arbitrary
control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.
Permissions, privileges, and access control is when an authorization policy is defined, individual or
sets of users are defined, and applications or processes that can perform actions on a resource such as a
database are defined. This can be very granular with an authorization policy. Administrators can control
certain actions, such as whether individuals or groups can read, create, modify (write), or delete.
Improper control of a resource vulnerabilities occur when the software does not maintain, or incorrectly maintains, control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.
Credentials management is a broad administrative area that deals with identifying individuals in a
system and controlling their access to resources within that system by associating user rights and restrictions with the established identity.
Indicator of poor code quality vulnerabilities occur when the code has features that do not directly
introduce a weakness or vulnerability, but indicate that the product has not been carefully developed or
maintained.

CONCLUSION/SUMMARY

Since its establishment, ICS-CERT has actively worked toward improving and enhancing cybersecurity postures within the ICS community by sharing control systems-related security incidents and mitigation measures. During this time, the group has become more effective and efficient sharing threat information and coordinating vulnerability alerts with researchers, vendors, and the ICS community at large.
As the ICS community continues to adopt new technology, it is imperative that public and private
partnerships continue to work toward the improved situational awareness of the community as a whole.
ICS-CERT urges organizations and asset owners to continue to monitor ICS-CERT advisories and alerts
and implement mitigation strategies that will improve the cybersecurity of the nation’s critical infrastructure.
