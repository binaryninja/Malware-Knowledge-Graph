The threat actor behind the lesser-known AstraLocker ransomware told BleepingComputer
they're shutting down the operation and plan to switch to cryptojacking.
The ransomware's developer submitted a ZIP archive with AstraLocker decryptors to the
VirusTotal malware analysis platform.
BleepingComputer downloaded the archive and confirmed that the decryptors are legitimate
and working after testing one of them against files encrypted in a recent AstroLocker
campaign.
While we only tested one decryptor that successfully decrypted files locked in one campaign,
other decryptors in the archive are likely designed to decrypt files encrypted in previous
campaigns.

"It was fun, and fun things always end sometime. I'm closing the operation, decryptors are in
zip files, clean. I will come back," AstraLocker's developer said. "I'm done with ransomware
for now. I'm going in cryptojaking lol."
While the developer did not reveal the reason behind the AstraLocker shutdown, it’s likely
due to the sudden publicity brought by recent reports that would land the operation in law
enforcement’s crosshairs.

A universal decryptor for AstraLocker ransomware is currently in the works, to be released in
the future by Emsisoft, a software company known for helping ransomware victims with data
decryption.
While it doesn't happen as often as we'd like, other ransomware groups have released
decryption keys and decryptors to BleepingComputer and security researchers as a gesture
of goodwill when shutting down or releasing new versions.
The list of decryption tools released in the past includes Avaddon, Ragnarok, SynAck,
TeslaCrypt, Crysis, AES-NI, Shade, FilesLocker, Ziggy, and FonixLocker.

AstraLocker ransomware background
As threat intelligence firm ReversingLabs recently revealed, AstraLocker used a somewhat
unorthodox method of encrypting its victims' devices compared to other ransomware strains.
Instead of first compromising the device (either by hacking it or buying access from other
threat actors), AstraLocker's operator would directly deploy the payloads from email
attachments using malicious Microsoft Word documents.
The lures used in AstroLocker attacks are documents hiding an OLE object with the
ransomware payload that will get deployed after the target clicks Run in the warning dialog
displayed when opening the document.

Before encrypting files on the now-compromised device, the ransomware will check if it's
running in a virtual machine, kill processes and stop backup and AV services that would
hinder the encryption process.
Based on ReversingLabs' analysis, AstraLocker is based on the leaked Babuk Locker
(Babyk) ransomware source code, a buggy but still dangerous strain that exited the space in
September 2021.
Additionally, one of the Monero wallet addresses in AstraLocker's ransom note was also
linked to the operators of Chaos ransomware.
