Threat Research
From at least January to April 2020, suspected Vietnamese actors APT32 carried out
intrusion campaigns against Chinese targets that Mandiant Threat Intelligence believes was
designed to collect intelligence on the COVID-19 crisis. Spear phishing messages were sent
by the actor to China's Ministry of Emergency Management as well as the government of
Wuhan province, where COVID-19 was first identified. While targeting of East Asia is
consistent with the activity we’ve previously reported on APT32, this incident, and other
publicly reported intrusions, are part of a global increase in cyber espionage related to the
crisis, carried out by states desperately seeking solutions and nonpublic information.
Phishing Emails with Tracking Links Target Chinese Government
The first known instance of this campaign was on Jan. 6, 2020, when APT32 sent an email
with an embedded tracking link (Figure 1) to China's Ministry of Emergency Management
using the sender address lijianxiang1870@163[.]com and the subject 第一期办公设备招标结
果报告 (translation: Report on the first quarter results of office equipment bids). The
embedded link contained the victim's email address and code to report back to the actors if
the email was opened.

Mandiant Threat Intelligence uncovered additional tracking URLs that revealed targets in
China's Wuhan government and an email account also associated with the Ministry of
Emergency Management.

The libjs.inquirerjs[.]com domain was used in December as a command and control domain
for a METALJACK phishing campaign likely targeting Southeast Asian countries.

Additional METALJACK Activity Suggests Campaigns Targeting Mandarin Speakers
Interested in COVID-19
APT32 likely used COVID-19-themed malicious attachments against Chinese speaking
targets. While we have not uncovered the full execution chain, we uncovered a METALJACK
loader displaying a Chinese-Language titled COVID-19 decoy document while launching its
payload.
When the METALJACK loader, krpt.dll (MD5: d739f10933c11bd6bd9677f91893986c) is
loaded, the export "_force_link_krpt" is likely called. The loader executes one of its
embedded resources, a COVID-themed RTF file, displaying the content to the victim and
saving the document to %TEMP%.
The decoy document (Figure 2) titled 冠状病毒实时更新：中国正在追踪来自湖北的旅行
者, MD5: c5b98b77810c5619d20b71791b820529 (Translation: COVID-19 live updates:
China is currently tracking all travelers coming from Hubei Province) displays a copy of a
New York Times article to the victim.

COVID-themed decoy document

The malware also loads shellcode in an additional resource, MD5:
a4808a329b071a1a37b8d03b1305b0cb, which contains the METALJACK payload. The
shellcode performs a system survey to collect the victim's computer name and username
and then appends those values to a URL string using libjs.inquirerjs[.]com. It then attempts to
call out to the URL. If the callout is successful, the malware loads the METALJACK payload
into memory.
It then uses vitlescaux[.]com for command and control.
Outlook
The COVID-19 crisis poses an intense, existential concern to governments, and the current
air of distrust is amplifying uncertainties, encouraging intelligence collection on a scale that
rivals armed conflict. National, state or provincial, and local governments, as well as non-

government organizations and international organizations, are being targeted, as seen in
reports. Medical research has been targeted as well, according to public statements by a
Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI. Until this crisis ends, we anticipate related cyber
espionage will continue to intensify globally.
