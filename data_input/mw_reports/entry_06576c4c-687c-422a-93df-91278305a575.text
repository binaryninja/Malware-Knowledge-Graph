McAfee Mobile Malware Research Team has identified malware targeting Mexico.
It poses as a security banking tool or as a bank application designed to report an out-ofservice ATM. In both instances, the malware relies on the sense of urgency created by tools

designed to prevent fraud to encourage targets to use them. This malware can
steal authentication factors crucial to accessing accounts from their victims on the targeted
financial institutions in Mexico.
McAfee Mobile Security is identifying this threat as Android/Banker.BT along
with its variants.

How does this malware spread?
The malware is distributed by a malicious phishing page that provides actual banking
security tips (copied from the original bank site) and recommends downloading the
malicious apps as a security tool or as an app to report out-of-service ATM. It’s very likely
that a smishing campaign is associated with this threat as part of the distribution method or
it’s also possible that victims may be contacted directly by scam phone calls made by the
criminals, a common occurrence in Latin America. Fortunately, this threat has not been
identified on Google Play yet.

Here’s how to protect yourself
During the pandemic, banks adopted new ways to interact with their clients. These rapid
changes meant customers were more willing to accept new procedures and to install new
apps as part of the ‘new normal’ to interact remotely. Seeing this, cybercriminals introduced new scams and phishing attacks that looked more credible than those in
the past leaving customers more susceptible.
Fortunately, McAfee Mobile Security is able to detect this new threat as
Android/Banker.BT. To protect yourself from this and similar threats:
Employ security software on your mobile devices
Think twice before downloading and installing suspicious apps especially if they
request SMS or Notification listener permissions.
Use official app stores however never trust them blindly as malware may be distributed
on these stores too so check for permissions, read reviews and seek out developer
information if available.
Use token based second authentication factor apps (hardware or software) over SMS
message authentication
Interested in the details? Here’s a deep dive on this malware

Behavior: Carefully guiding the victim to provide their credentials
Once the malicious app is installed and started, the first activity shows a message in Spanish
that explains the fake purpose of the app:
– Fake Tool to report fraudulent movements that creates a sense of urgency:

Figure 2- Malicious app introduction that tries to lure users to provide their bank credentials\
“The ‘bank name has created a tool to allow you to block any suspicious movement. All
operations listed on the app are still pending. If you fail to block the unrecognized
movements in less than 24 hours, then they will charge your account automatically.
At the end of the blocking process, you will receive an SMS message with the details of the
blocked operations.”
– In the case of the Fake ATM failure tool to request a new credit card under the pandemic
context, there is a similar text that lures users into a false sense of security:

Figure 3- Malicious app introduction of ATM reporting variant that uses the Covid-19
pandemic as a pretext to lure users into providing their bank credentials
“As a Covid-19 sanitary measure, this new option has been created. You will receive an ID
via SMS for your report and then you can request your new card at any branch or receive it
at your registered home address for free. Alert! We will never request your sensitive data
such as NIP or CVV.”This gives credibility to the app since it’s saying it will not ask for some
sensitive data; however, it will ask for web banking credentials.
If the victims tap on “Ingresar” (“access”) then the banking trojan asks for SMS permissions
and launch activity to enter the user id or account number and then the password. In the
background, the password or ‘clave’ is transmitted to the criminal’s server without verifying if
the provided credentials are valid or being redirected to the original bank site as many others
banking trojan does.

Finally, a fixed fake list of transactions is displayed so the user can take the action of
blocking them as part of the scam however at this point the crooks already have the victim’s
login data and access to their device SMS messages so they are capable to steal the second
authentication factor.

Figure 5- Fake list of fraudulent transactions
In case of the fake tool app to request a new card, the app shows a message that says at the
end “We have created this Covid-19 sanitary measure and we invite you to visit our antifraud tips where you will learn how to protect your account”.

Figure 6- Final view after the malware already obtained bank credentials reinforcing the
concept that this application is a tool created under the covid-19 context.
In the background the malware contacts the command-and-control server that is hosted in
the same domain used for distribution and it sends the user credentials and all users SMS
messages over HTTPS as query parameters (as part of the URL) which can lead to the
sensitive data to be stored in web server logs and not only the final attacker
destination. Usually, malware of this type has poor handling of the stolen data, therefore, it’s
not surprising if this information is leaked or compromised by other criminal groups which
makes this type of threat even riskier for the victims. Actually, in figure 8 there is a partial
screenshot of an exposed page that contains the structure to display the stolen data.

page in the C2 that contains a table to display SMS messages captured from the infected
devices.
This mobile banker is interesting due it’s a scam developed from scratch that is not linked to
well-known and more powerful banking trojan frameworks that are commercialized in the
black market between cyber-criminals. This is clearly a local development that may evolve in
the future in a more serious threat since the decompiled code shows accessibility services
class is present but not implemented which leads to thinking that the malware authors are
trying to emulate the malicious behavior of more mature malware families. From the selfevasion perspective, the malware does not offer any technique to avoid analysis, detection,
or decompiling that is signal it’s in an early stage of development.
