Thanks for this info Krebs, as always.

My kingdom, my kingdom for a y-axis label on the first CheckPoint plot!
The rest of the article is certainly concerning, but without scale and labeling, all we
know from that graph is that something is going up on a daily basis.

His kingdom, his kingdom for an x-axis label on the first CheckPoint plot!

His kingdoom! Her kingdoom for an x-axis labull on th second CheckPoint plot!
meaningless comments!
3. PattiM October 25, 2017
That was exactly my first thought – unlabeled graphs can’t be interpreted.

Have researchers been able to identify C&Cs and involved domain names ?

We need a “patch or die” worm.
Recruits a botnet of unpatched and unpatchable devices, then permanently bricks
every single one.
A few rounds of that and the message might sink in.
I am not recommending anyone does this because they will go to prison, but I still wish
someone would.
1. Robert October 23, 2017
Ben, you’re not the 1st 1 to wish 4 such. Problem is, the Gov’t doesn’t seem to
care, manufacturers of the IoT devices don’t seem to care, ISP don’t seem to
care, people who own the devices don’t seem to care, yet everyone gets all bent
out of shape when things go wrong. Well, do something about the problem
“before” it becomes a problem! Patch, change passwords, buy more reliable Iot’s.
But I do hope some 12 yr old decides to stop the problem (he won’t go to jail, will
he?).
I’ve noticed more probes of my ports for a few months, nothing major like last
year though. But I’m seeing lots of probes from w/i the US (probably slaved PC’s),
including one I never saw in a decade of probe logs – Microsoft Media Server
(MMS). I’m getting port probes way beyond just telnet, maybe something is up.
1. SeymourB October 24, 2017
Unfortunately thanks to widespread use of netnannies and similar
childproofing our 12 year olds aren’t as technical as the generation before
them.
When you shove them into padded rooms for their entire childhood, you
can’t be surprised that all they know are padded rooms.

brickerbot may interest you
1. Robert October 24, 2017
Paul – “brickerbot may interest you”
Just did a bit of reading on Brickerbot. I can see the carnage it could cause
as it doesn’t discriminate between an unsecured but vital piece of
equipment in a hospital and the average IoT camera. Both get bricked.
“Strong password protection” is the key that manufacturers can offer
consumers of IoT devices, unlocking such a device would require the same
key, much harder to do.
I have no IoT dog in this fight so I don’t care but it can still affect me via,
say, that hospital device if I’m a patient! I hope that if anything good comes
out of this new mess, it’s that manufacturers and end users will finally take
steps to help prevent Webageddon from making the Internet useless for
everyone.
I reacted to the Equifax breach by freezing my credit with all potential
access points for the bad guys. Better to do something now rather than wait
and see if I’m going to be affected. Something about a ounce of prevention
being worth a pound of cure.
If I do buy an Iot device, you can be sure it will be one that offers strong
password protection, one that at least tries to prevent the pound of cure
approach. More expensive up front perhaps, but cheaper in the long run.

It will do nothing. they are using the smart meter on your house to
control anything in it. I know because I have been dealing with it
involuntarily for about 17 years (since 2004). I have a iPhone 6s with
sprint service, Verizon home internet suite with security and still they
are either not interested in things they can fix then and there so the
gapping security hole gets ignored to a Krebs-like security researcher
finds and then reports the problem. I’ve sent the screenshot of the
“springboard” on my iPhone and they were stumped. the actual
springboard icon is missing. I tried to explain that the ITouch feature is
not working correctly never heard anything yet.

I wish you well with the web site changes.
Oh and thanks for the article as well.. Appreciate the work you do.

Two of my clients suffered their DVR’s being recruited to the Mirai Botnet earlier this
year. AVTECH have been unresponsive and as a short-term fix, unexpected ports were
configured prevent the devices being compromised. Each compromised device had an
IP address applied in the 10.*.*.* range (I can’t remember the actual configuration). The
devices went off line and the performance, even at the local console was severely
degraded. The problem for my clients is that they require access to these DVR’s as a
key business requirement. They haven’t been hacked since the ports were changed
but reading further I see that the new variant of this attack no longer requires the admin
password to commandeer the device. Does anyone know if it is possible to detect if
they have been compromised?
7. Rich A October 23, 2017
Reconsider cheering on brickerbot!
There probably is no economic answer to unsecured devices, except to disable them.

8. Robert Scroggins October 23, 2017
What port(s) do IOTs use? Perhaps something could be done to beef up security at that
level.
Thanks, Brian!
Regards,
1. somguy October 24, 2017
Short non technical answer:
They use all ports.
That’s not a solution.
9. Winston October 24, 2017
How vulnerable are self-funded and installed Orwell Telescreens Amazon Echo, Echo
Look, Tap, etc. to hacking? Did they do the smart things security-wise?
1. Winstom October 25, 2017
Looks like we’re going to see a familiar face on the IoT vulnerability subject next
week on Vice channel’s Cyberwar series.
1. BrianKrebs Post authorOctober 25, 2017
Yup, recorded that in late spring. Will be great to see what they’ve done with
it. I’ve enjoyed the series.

10. Chris October 24, 2017
@kerbonsecurity did you ever follow up on the 503C you where thinking of setting up in
2016? ‘The Center for the Defense of Internet Journalism’ for those in the journalism
community that may require protection from large attacks such as the one you
endured?
Thanks,
11. Dan October 24, 2017
Hi Brian, thanks for the article !
Just as a note: “CheckPoint” is two words, “Check Point”.
12. Richard Stein October 24, 2017
Please add a vertical axis scale to the graph of “Trending Attack IP Addresses.” Would
like see order of magnitude – use log-scale.
1. Lori October 24, 2017
Since several people have commented on this, I went to Check Point to find their
graph – and they do not have a vertical axis on it, so it would be difficult for Brian
to provide one. Looks like it is Check Point that needs to define the scale on their
graph.
13. Jerry October 24, 2017
It appears a firmware update is available for the Linksys e1500 router after the
identified vulnerabilities. Hopefully it can mitigate these vulnerabilities. Thanks for
bringing this to our attention Mr Krebs.
14. Bob October 24, 2017
If this is big enough and does enough damage, it might be the wake up call that is
needed to get the everyone to take IOT security seriously.

Wow, that chart! The one from Checkpoint… It’s so… Meaningless.
I see horizontal lines, but they don’t mean anything.
While other readers comment that the article is good, it’s slop like this (and previous
editing problems) that make me stop reading and just skip for the point. Get it together
Krebs, and hire an editor.
1. SeymourB October 24, 2017
More than likely it was intentionally left off by CP so the authors couldn’t use it to
determine the source(s) of their data.
Whatever amount they note will not accurately match the real-world installations,
so by correlating groups of systems you can do simple math to determine which
groups CP has access to and shut down their insight into your botnet.
Unless you’re paying Brian to provide you with information, you’re not in a
position to make demands. Its kind of like people who use an open source project
then make demands to the author – sorry but it doesn’t work that way.
1. Margaret October 24, 2017
Thank you Seymour!!!!! I agree with you. Brian does a great service for us…
maybe we need to exert a little of our own effort to get a better
understanding rather than putting a demand we have no right to do on
Brian.
2. J. W. October 24, 2017
Complain to Checkpoint, not Krebs. It’s identical to what’s on the Checkpoint site,
as noted.
3. Louise October 24, 2017
The CheckPoint graph offers a rough summary of number of sources of infection
worldwide.
The Y-axis represents number of organizations infected, with increments of
100,000, and the X-axis is the time over which this was discovered, starting “the
last few days of September.” September 29th is the first coordinate labeled.
1. Nobby Nobbs October 25, 2017
Thanks for that, Louise. That helps a lot.
Thanks for keeping an eye on this, Brian. I wonder about “smart” tvs, seems
like they could be similarly vulnerable. And the lucky hacker might get an
earful of archived voice commands…

Brian,
Thanks for the very thought provoking post.
You have prompted me to start investigating yet another IoT device in my home. The
satellite receiver in my living room advertises itself as a WiFi connection point. I have
no idea of its security settings, who can see it, who it talks to, or who can access it….
1. Gary October 25, 2017
At the very least, find the default password and change it. Ideally if you don’t use
the WAP, disable it.
17. Brian Failkrebs October 25, 2017
Y AXIS LABEL WHY YOU NO HAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
graph fail. with great fail. in the fail fail.
1. Michael Dortch October 25, 2017
Always a good idea to read through the earlier comments before posting yours.
Might save you a bit of time. Also embarrassment.

🙂

18. BrickerBot sounds interesting, but I agree with the comment against it. There are better
and safer ways to “fix” the Internet.
I would rather see a bot that finds a problem send a notice to the tech contact on the
domain name (if there is one), and record the date and time of the problem. After some
period of time the bot can return to see if the problem has been fixed, and if not contact
the other domain contacts.
If there is no domain involved, then using IP WHOIS the person or organization for the
IP block can be notified. Failing that, I would try The upstream provider. At some point if
the problem is not fixed and especially if an IP range contains many problems, that
segment should be isolated or added to a black list.
If we can’t fix this, I foresee a future where we have two Internets, one public and one
private. The private Internet will be something we pay for where the providers have a
way to enforce any rules they see fit to establish. On it, you can expect to be really safe
and unoffended with no parental restrictions needed.

19. Reader October 26, 2017
With regard to IOT, no problem for me: I’ve never trusted the idea of remote access of
stuff in my home. If I can remote control, someone else can remote control.
Our government and utility providers should also remember that if they can remote
control something, bad guys can remote control, too.
Brian, please don’t make this site adaptive to devices. I REALLY HATE WHEN
WEBSITES feed me their mobile versions, even when I’m using a small screen. And
one thing I have liked on this site is that it works perfectly, identically, and consistently
with or without Javascript.
20. PCar October 26, 2017
Thanks for the heads up! I did not see Apple’s AirPort Listed, so for this I am thankful! It
never hurts to be watchful, especially with the current WPA2 Threat, which is mild as
compared to your report above! The hit just keep on rolling! Thank heaven for
krebsonsecurity.com !
21. Robert October 26, 2017
Considering the new push for money from Amazon with their “Amazon Key”, I wonder
how long before it becomes a “prime” (pun intended) target for hackers. Not on my
wish list but I’m sure the NSA would like all of us to have one, would make it so much
easier to keep an eye/ear on us

😉

22. dcmargo54 October 27, 2017
Haven’t even read the article yet. I just love the little IT men in the pic.
23. Bob Williams October 28, 2017
For God’s sake, Brian. “Impactful” is not a word. Your English teacher would have
slapped you. Degradation by respected journalists of the English language is as
slippery a slope as our slide into the cyber netherworld.
-Bob
1. BrianKrebs Post authorOctober 28, 2017
Bob,
There’s nothing incorrect about the word impactful. Can’t help it if someone told
you some time ago that it was not a word, but I assure you it is. Languages are
living organisms that change over time. Maybe if your own vocabulary wasn’t so
fossilized, you’d recognize this. Merriam-Webster agrees it’s a word, btw:
