WikiLeaks Task Force Final Report

Executive Summary
WikiLeaks’ announcement on 7 March that it possessed cyber tools from CIA’s Center for
Cyber Intelligence (CCI), dubbed “Vault 7,” marked the largest data loss in CIA history. In its
initial public disclosure, WikiLeaks provided the names and brief descriptions of multiple tools
that CIA developed for cyber operations. Since 7 March, WikiLeaks has published more
comprehensive descriptions of 35 tools, including internal CIA documents associated with each
tool.

We assess that in spring 2016 a CIA employee stole at least 180 gigabytes to as
much as 34 terabytes of information. This is roughly equivalent to 11.6 million to 2.2 billion
pages in Microsoft Word. This data loss includes
cyber tools that resided on the Center
for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) software development network (DevLAN). We cannot
determine the precise scope of the loss because, like other mission systemsa at that time,
DevLAN did not require user activity monitoring or other safeguards that exist on our
enterprise system.

To date, WikiLeaks has released user and training guides and limited
source code from two parts of DevLAN: Stash, a source code repository, and Confluence, a
collaboration and communication platform. All of the documents reveal, to varying degrees,
CIA’s tradecraft in cyber operations.
This product is intended for internal Agency use.

We define a mission system as any computer-based capability that collects, stores, processes, or communicates information that
is managed by a mission component

Critical Context
CCI: The WikiLeaks breach occurred at CCI, whose mission is to transform intelligence
through
cyber operations. It would be unfair to lay the blame for the breach with the
current management, as the breach occurred before most joined CCI. Equally, CCI correctly
notes that the mission system in question complied with all Agency requirements at the time of
the breach. However, in a press to meet growing and critical mission needs, CCI had prioritized
building cyber weapons at the expense of securing their own systems. Day-to-day security
practices had become woefully lax. The Development Network (DevLAN) on which CCI’s work
product resided had been certified and accredited, but CCI had not worked with CIMC to
develop or deploy user activity monitoring or robust server audit capability. Most of our sensitive
cyber weapons were not compartmented, users shared systems administrator-level passwords,
there were no effective removable media controls, and historical data was available to users
indefinitely. Furthermore, CCI focused on building cyber weapons and neglected to also prepare
mitigation packages if those tools were exposed. These shortcomings were emblematic of a
culture that evolved over years that too often prioritized creativity and collaboration at the
expense of security.

Mission Systems: CIA has moved too slowly to put in place the safeguards that we
knew were necessary given successive breaches to other US Government agencies. For nearly
a decade WikiLeaks has exploited the digital realm to profoundly reshape opportunities for
individuals sworn to protect our nation’s secrets to leak classified or sensitive information. While
CIA was an early leader in securing our enterprise information technology (IT) system, we failed
to correct acute vulnerabilities to our mission IT systems. Because the stolen data resided on a
mission system that lacked user activity monitoring and a robust server audit capability, we did
not realize the loss had occurred until a year later, when WikiLeaks publicly announced it in
March 2017. Had the data been stolen for the benefit of a state adversary and not published, we
might still be unaware of the loss—as would be true for the vast majority of data on Agency
mission systems.
—

The Agency for years has developed and operated IT mission systems outside the
purview and governance of enterprise IT, citing the need for mission functionality and
speed. While often fulfilling a valid purpose, this “shadow IT” exemplifies a broader cultural
issue that separates enterprise IT from mission IT, has allowed mission system owners to
determine how or if they will police themselves, and has placed the Agency at
unacceptable risk.

This wake-up call presents us
with an opportunity to right longstanding imbalances and lapses, to reorient how we view risk,
. We must recognize when we are taking smart risks and
when operational shortcuts or waivers create unwarranted risk to our work and to the Agency.
We must care as much about securing our systems as we care about running them if we are to
make the necessary revolutionary change.

Recommendations

The WikiLeaks Vault 7 disclosures have brought to light multiple ongoing CIA failures that
our recommendations are designed to address:
—

We failed to equip the mission system in question with user activity monitoring and
robust server audit capability, which could have deterred, detected, and possibly prevented
the theft.

—

We failed to empower any single officer with the ability to ensure that all Agency
information systems are built secure and remain so throughout their life cycle. Because no
one had that ability, no one was accountable—and the mission system in question, like
others, lacked appropriate security.
many

—

We failed to ensure that our ability to secure our information systems against
emerging threats kept pace with the growth of such systems across the Agency.

b

We failed to recognize or act in a coordinated fashion on warning signs that a person
or persons with access to CIA classified information posed an unacceptable risk to national
security. (See recommendations B1, B2, B3, B4, B6, B7, B8, B9, and C8.)

A “zero-day” exploit is software designed to exploit a previously unknown or unpatched computer vulnerability.

Recommendation A5:
Enhance information technology security guidelines and classified information
handling restrictions for zero-day exploits and offensive cyber tools, consistent with
Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information. We judge the vulnerability
of and threat to this information is exceptional and warrants additional security protections, to
include requiring segmentation of knowledge, tools, and people through physical and logical
infrastructure, policy and procedural controls, and enforcing strict need-to-know access to the
tools and exploits.

The WikiLeaks disclosures revealed resource-driven gaps and weaknesses in CIA’s
insider threat program. There have been seams in communication between components such
as the Office of Medical Services, Human Resources, Security, Counterintelligence Mission
Center, and line management that have sometimes prevented us from connecting the dots to
corporately detect and address insider threats.

—

We have been slow—due to resource choices and cultural resistance—to extend
state-of-the-art audit and user activity monitoring technology to mission systems not
connected to the main enterprise network.

Recommendation
Frequent personnel security reviews and
training have focused on enterprise “privileged users,” defined as individuals designated and
entrusted by managers to perform elevated functions on a network, system, or application. This
does not include privileged users on mission systems or those with extraordinary access or
capabilities, such as EDG developers.

14

Data in Confluence, a collaboration and communication platform, and some
data in Stash, a source code repository, have been released by WikiLeaks; we assess
WikiLeaks possesses all of the Confluence and Stash data.51 However, we now assess with
moderate confidence that WikiLeaks does not possess the Gold folder of final versions of all
developed tools and source code that resided on the Development Network (DevLAN), even
though WikiLeaks claims it has released only a small slice of the archive it possesses. The Gold
folder was better protected; WikiLeaks so far has released data in Stash despite the availability
of newer, easier to exploit versions of tools in Gold; and Gold’s size, several terabytes, made it
harder to export.

45

We are making educated assumptions about the scope and timing of the
loss, in part because we lacked effective monitoring and auditing of this mission system.

46

The WikiLeaks disclosures revealed gaps and weaknesses in CIA’s Insider Threat
program, which has traditionally relied on close coordination between the Office of Security and
CIMC. Among the gaps are the seams in communication between components such as the
Office of General Counsel, Medical Services, Human Resources, security, counterintelligence,
and line management that have sometimes prevented us from connecting the dots to
corporately detect and address Insider Threat issues.
