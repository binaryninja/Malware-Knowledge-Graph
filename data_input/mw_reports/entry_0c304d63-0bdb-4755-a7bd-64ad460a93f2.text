Analysis of domains listed in a CERT-UA warning revealed additional domains linked to
phishing attacks targeting Ukrainian government and military personnel and Polish-speaking
individuals. Wednesday, March 2, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers investigated a Computer
Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) warning of phishing activity posted to
Facebook on February 25, 2022 (see Figure 1). CERT-UA attributed the activity to the Minsk1/6

based UNC1151 threat group. UNC1511 is reportedly linked to the Belarusian government
and responsible for the Ghostwriter influence campaigns. As of this publication, CTU™
researchers have not validated this attribution assessment. CTU researchers attribute this
activity to the MOONSCAPE threat group.

The rudimentary phishing message coaxes the target to use a malicious phishing link. It is
possible that the phishing messages included imagery that was not included in the Facebook
post.
CTU researchers analyzed the two domains listed in the Facebook post and identified seven
additional domains based on WHOIS and passive DNS data. This cluster uses the '.space'
top-level domain (TLD), shares a common registrant "Apolena Zorka", was registered via
Public Domain Registry Ltd., and is primarily hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure. Each of
the domains aligns with a small set of common themes typical of MOONSCAPE
infrastructure. Themes include information portals, email validation, cloud services, or
government entities. The Apolena Zorka cluster is a mix of generic email validation and
domains spoofing popular Ukrainian information services (see Figure 2). This combination
suggests that the websites may have been created for Ukrainian targets, including those that
prompted the CERT-UA warning.

CTU researchers identified another set of domains with similar characteristics to the Apolena
Zorka cluster, although this cluster used the "Radka Dominika" registrant (see Figure 3).
These domains included similar themes but used Polish words for verification (weryfikacja)
and validation (walidacja) in several generic email validation-themed domains. Another
identified domain (ron-mil . space) appears to spoof the legitimate domain of the Polish
Ministry of National Defense (ron . mil . pl).

When ordered by creation date, the threat actors switch between domains aligned to
Ukrainian targets and domains likely aligned with Polish-speaking targets. This pattern
illustrates a regular cadence of new domain creation (see Figure 4). This activity likely
reflects an operational rotation involving multiple demographics they target.

MOONSCAPE creates new infrastructure but maintains a preference for specific keywords
and reuses old infrastructure. For example, the 'verify-email . space' domain was created on
February 2 and resolves to IP address 185 . 244 . 180 . 13. This IP address also hosted 'uapassport . site', which was created on June 22, 2021. With the exception of the TLD, the 'uapassport . site' domain is identical to the 'ua-passport . space' domain created on December
15, 2021.
MOONSCAPE has conducted phishing campaigns for years, targeting military, diplomatic,
and government personnel in Eastern European NATO countries such as Poland, Lithuania,
and Latvia as well as countries that border Belarus such as Ukraine. The February phishing
attacks demonstrate that the group's espionage-focused activity continues and potentially
contributes to intelligence collection on Ukrainian entities in support of Russia's military
invasion of Ukraine that commenced on February 24, 2022.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. The
domains may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a
browser.
