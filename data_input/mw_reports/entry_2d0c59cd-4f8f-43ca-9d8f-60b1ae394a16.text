Prometheus is a relatively new variant of the Thanos ransomware that is operated independently by the
Prometheus group, and was first observed in February of 2021. In just a short period of time, Prometheus
caused a lot of damage, and breached over 40 companies.

Key Findings
High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the
destructive potential of the attacks.
Human Operated Attack: Prior to the deployment of the ransomware, the attackers attempt to
infiltrate and move laterally throughout the organization, carrying out a fully-developed attack
operation.
Shared Builder: The Prometheus group, as well as other threat actors, used the Thanos builder to
build and customize their ransomware.
Group of REvil?: Prometheus ransomware branding themselves as part of the REvil group, probably
in an attempt to piggyback on the fame of one of the most infamous - and successful - ransomware
groups.
Detected and Prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform fully detects and prevents the
Prometheus ransomware:

Cybereason Detects and Blocks Prometheus Ransomware
Like other prominent ransomware groups, such as the DarkSide group, Prometheus follows the RaaS
business model and operates as a professional enterprise where it refers to its victims as “customers,” and
communicates with them using a customer service ticketing system.
In addition, Prometheus follows the double extortion trend and hosts a leak site, where it has a “hall of
shame” for victims and posts stolen data for sale. The names of the victims are posted on the website even
before the victims decide whether to pay or not, either under the status “waiting for the company decision” or
“company paid, data is not for sale.”
When it comes to the affected industries and regions, the group seems to attack almost indiscriminately.
According to their website, the group claims to have breached over 40 organizations from different
industries/sectors. Among their victims observed were companies in the following industries: consulting, oil
and gas, financial, media, governments, advertising, manufacturing, retail, food, hotels, manufacturing,
insurance, transportation, and medical services. The regions affected are South America, US, UK, MiddleEast, UAE, Asia and Europe.
It’s also interesting to note that some victims appear to be on the list more than once, but attacked in
different time periods. Since those victims had paid, it’s unclear at this point if it’s by mistake or that the
group has attacked the same victim more than once before or even after paying.
A recent Cybereason report titled Ransomware: The True Cost to Business, found that 80% of organizations
that paid a ransom were hit by a second attack, and almost half of those were hit by the same threat group.

Group of REvil?
Up until June 14th, the operators of Prometheus claimed to be part of the notorious REvil ransomware
group, and even mentioned them in their logo. On June 15th, the group decided to delete the name of REvil
from their logo, and remove any potential relation to the group.

2/16

It is worth noting that there hasn’t been strong or conclusive evidence of a real connection or collaboration
between the two groups and the assumption is that the Prometheus group was most likely just using the
name and reputation of REvil to increase the likelihood of ransom payments.
Although it is unclear why the group has decided to remove the name of REvil from their logo, it’s interesting
to look at the timing. The REvil group was just attributed to another major attack infecting potentially
thousands of companies by way of an exploit against Kaseya VSA remote management service which
propagated ransomware through the IT service provider’s Managed Services Provider network, and a recent
attack against the global food company JBS which drew attention to them from the US authorities.
In May, it was the DarkSide group that made big headlines after attacking the Colonial Pipeline network,
which caused the US authorities to take actions that eventually led to the DarkSide group shutting down
their operations (allegedly). Ransomware operators will usually try to evade such unwanted publicity
because of their fear of retaliation from law enforcement agencies.

From one Builder to Multiple Ransomware
As mentioned in the beginning of this blog post, Prometheus is not an entirely new ransomware. It is a
variant of the Thanos ransomware, which has been sold in underground forums since late 2019. The group
behind Prometheus, as well as other threat actors, bought Thanos and used the builder that comes with it to
customize their ransomware:

Most of the distinguishing changes observed include the extension that is added to the encrypted files and
of course the ransom note content. Because of that, there are different variants of the Thanos ransomware
out there, with most of them named after the extension that is appended to the encrypted files.

Prometheus Ransomware Analysis
The binary generated by the builder is an obfuscated .NET executable that consists of a main function that
is responsible to decode base64 strings in memory and pass them to the other functions.
Among the functionality observed by the malware is the ability to enumerate processes and manipulate with
them, changing registry keys, setting persistence, downloading additional files, collecting information about
the machine and more:

Setting Persistence
Prometheus creates persistence by copying the file into the startup folder of the user. This ensures that the
malware will continue to run after logoff-login of the user:

Ensuring Successful File Encryption

6/16

Upon execution, Prometheus performs a series of tasks to ensure that it will run smoothly without
interference.
These tasks include stopping common security tools and backup related processes, interacting with the
registry and scheduled task, deleting files, and interacting with services.
Deleting Raccine:
Raccine is a ransomware prevention tool that tries to stop ransomware from deleting shadow copies in
Windows. Prometheus deletes the scheduled task and the registry keys of the software:
reg delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V "Raccine Tray" /F
reg delete HKCU\Software\Raccine /F
schtasks /DELETE /TN "Raccine Rules Updater" /F

Deleting Raccine: deleting the registry key and scheduled task and killing the process
Stopping Processes:
Prometheus stops different processes that may interfere with its execution, and also to free DB related files
for encryption:

Deleting Shadow Copies
Like other ransomware, Prometheus deletes the shadow copies to prevent restoring backups of the machine
after encrypting files. To do so, it runs the following PowerShell command:
"powershell.exe" & Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object { $_Delete(); }

Tunneling Protocol) to access remote servers

Spreading Across The Network
Once successfully executed, Prometheus will try to spread in the network using different methods. First, it
will “prepare the ground” by performing some reconnaissance commands that include running “Net view”
and “arp -a”, followed by a ping sweep to check the connections and potential machines to infect.
Then it continues with changing local firewall rules, downloading Psexec/Paexec and in some cases
ProcessHider as well, and enabling SMB1 protocol - most likely to exploit a vulnerability for spreading using
SMB, much like as EternalBlue:
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Network Discovery\" new enable=Yes
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="File and Printer Sharing" new enable=Yes
powershell.exe & Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol
After that, the malware begins the spreading process. Initially it will try an easy way using the “Net use”
command to try to copy itself into shared folders. Then it will run PsExec/PaExec remotely to execute the
binary. On other occasions it will try to exploit a SMB vulnerability to spread:

ProcessHider

Encrypting The Files

11/16

After ensuring successful execution of the malware and deleting backup files, Prometheus begins it’s
encryption routine. First, it will search for files matching extensions that were passed in build time. Those
extensions vary from Microsoft Office files, images, scripts, archives, music, videos, and different database
files:

Searching for DB files
The builder also supports a “fast mode” of encryption where only a portion of each file is encrypted. When
this mode is enabled during build time, the ransomware encrypts a preconfigured amount of data from each
file and overwrites the file with the encrypted content. This technique saves Prometheus time and shortens
the entire encryption time, which can take just seconds up to a few minutes, depending on the number of
files on the targeted machine.
Prometheus appends a custom extension that is unique for every executable and in some variants even
contains the name of the victim:

Finally, Prometheus drops a ransom note in .hta and text format, and presents the .hta file to the end user:

Cybereason Detection and Prevention
13/16

Ransomware attacks are on the rise. A recently released report by Cybereason, titled Ransomware: The
True Cost to Business, detailed how malicious actors are fine-tuning their ransomware campaign tactics and
how both the frequency and severity of successful ransomware attacks have tremendous impact on victim
organizations and their ability to conduct business.
The Cybereason Defense Platform is able to prevent the execution of the Prometheus Ransomware using
multi-layer protection that detects and blocks ransomware with threat intelligence, machine learning, and
next-gen antivirus (NGAV) capabilities. Additionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled,
behavioral detection techniques in the platform are able to detect and prevent any attempt to encrypt files
and automatically generates a MalopTM for it with the complete attack narrative:

Malop for Prometheus ransomware as shown in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Using the Anti-Malware feature with the right configurations (listed in the recommendations below), the
Cybereason Defense Platform will also detect and prevent the execution of the ransomware and ensure that
it cannot encrypt targeted files. The prevention is based on machine learning, which blocks both known and
unknown malware variants:
