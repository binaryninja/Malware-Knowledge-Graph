RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: NEEDLES IN A
HAYSTACK
This post was authored by Mariano Graziano.
Malware sandboxes are automated dynamic analysis systems that execute programs in a
controlled environment. Within the large volumes of samples submitted daily to these
services, some submissions appear to be different from others and show interesting
characteristics. At USENIX Security 2015 I presented a paper in which we proposed a
method to automatically discover malware developments from samples submitted to
online dynamic analysis systems. The research was conducted by dissecting the Anubis
sandbox dataset which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years. The
methodology we proposed was effective and we were able to detect many interesting
cases in which the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the
development phase of the threats.
Another interesting result that came from the research concerns the samples attributed to
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. Surprisingly, some of the malware samples
used in these sophisticated attacks had been submitted to the Anubis sandbox months -sometimes even years -- before the attack had been attributed to the proper APT
campaign by a security vendor. To be perfectly clear, we are not saying that it took security
vendors months or years to detect a threat. Most times, we are able to detect the threats
in no more than a few hours. It is just that the malware samples were mislabeled and not
properly associated with APT campaigns. In general, the same goes for non-APT malware
campaigns. In this blog post, we tried to see if the same applied to the Cisco dataset.
Speciﬁcally, we chose ten APT campaigns, -- some of which were already covered in the
Usenix paper. We decided to inspect two different datasets: our incoming sample feeds /
malware zoo, and the telemetry associated with our Advanced Malware Protection (AMP)
solutions. Talos receives samples from over 100 external feeds ranging from anti-malware
companies to research centers, while the AMP dataset contains telemetry from the Cisco
AMP user-base.
The remaining part of this post is organized as follows. First, we show the APT campaigns
we investigated. Second, we summarize the results of the analysis of the Talos dataset.
Third, we show the results from the AMP dataset. Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings.

The ten malware campaigns in the table above garnered signiﬁcant media attention when
discovered, with some of them clearly falling in the area of APT. They were found by
different security companies between 2010 and 2015, having different levels of
sophistication and different objectives. Moreover, these APT campaigns were not limited
to western countries. They have affected organizations all over the world. Most of the time,
connecting the dots and drawing relationships between samples and campaigns take
months and many experts. This means the security company that releases a detailed
report documenting the campaign is aware of it long before the information is made public.
However, we believe the “public release” date is still a good metric, because it is the
moment at which all the other security companies and the entire world are made aware of
these threats.
Another important aspect during an APT investigation is attribution. While detection is
done quickly, attribution for these campaigns is often an open and hard problem to solve.
Most of the times the perpetrators remain unknown even after months of work by security
researchers. However, sometimes researchers are able to connect the dots and attribute
the attack to a threat actor. This was the case for some of the APT campaigns discussed
so far. Some of these threats have been attributed to state-sponsored actors, others to
cyber criminals or to espionage attacks. However, like in the USENIX publication, in this
post we will make no speculation about attribution.
In the next paragraphs, we will present the results of searching for samples associated
with these APT campaigns in our datasets.

This table shows the results of the analysis of our incoming sample feeds/malware zoo.
For every campaign, we checked in our malware zoo to see when they had been initially
submitted to us. Given that we know when information about these APT campaigns was
made public, we can compute the number of days it took the security community to
publicly tie the samples to an APT campaign, even though the samples had been marked
malicious for other reasons. On average, these samples went for 458 days before being
tied to an APT campaign. The table presents the average number of days for the entire
campaign, and we go from a few months as in the case of “Aurora” to more than three
years for “Equation”. Notice that these ﬁgures come from our malware zoo which collects
samples from external sources and in general are a good indicator given the amount of
samples received per day. Notice that these numbers vary based on the dataset.

The vast majority of the submissions come from big organizations such as Antivirus
companies. Interestingly, a signiﬁcant percentage is submitted by VirusTotal. For this
reason we decided to check the submitters for possible links and intelligence information.
As already documented by Dixon, information about the submitters of samples is not
publicly available, but can partially be retrieved from their Intelligence service. For every
sample, it is possible to know a hash (a hexadecimal unique identiﬁer of the submitter), the
country (from the geolocalization of the IP address of the submitter) and the method (the
way the sample has been submitted, for instance via the web interface or the APIs). This
opaque information complicates the analysis a little bit, but it is still possible to obtain
interesting results.

The table above summarizes our ﬁndings from VirusTotal. The ﬁrst column shows the
hash of the submitter. This means that the submitter sent one or more samples of a given
APT campaign to VirusTotal before its public release. One can only speculate on who
these submitters are. They could very likely be the threat actors themselves, testing to see
if their malware is detected by the AV companies. They could also be security researchers
or vendors who are trying to get information from VirusTotal. It is noteworthy that in most of
the cases the same submitters uploaded samples belonging to different APT campaigns.

We went through our logs to search for entries that contained hashes related to the ten
APT campaigns we have been investigating. Interestingly, we got hits for eight different
hashes belonging to three different campaigns that were discovered on Cisco AMP
customer machines before the APT campaign was publicly identiﬁed.

As the number of threats per day continues to increase, the number of malware samples
security companies automatically analyze increases. Much of the analysis is comprised of
dynamic analysis systems, such as sandboxes, to determine whether the sample is
malicious or not. These samples are then stored for further analysis. Due to the large
numbers of samples, in many organizations the vast majority of these samples remain

numbers of samples, in many organizations the vast majority of these samples remain
categorized solely on the initial sandbox run. Even when these samples are shared among
companies or via other services like VirusTotal some malware samples can go unnoticed
for months because they are marked as malware but given some generic name, such as
“Win.Trojan.Agent”. Then we are shocked when a security company discovers an APT
campaign that has supposedly gone unnoticed for years.
The results of this post conﬁrm the assumption of the Usenix paper, also based on a
dataset of a big security company and similar results are expected throughout the security
industry. Many times, malware is initially submitted to sandbox systems and marked as
malicious based on the output of the sandbox. Then the authors use that information to
tweak the sample to avoid detection in future sandbox runs through various evasion
tactics. In other situations, the initial sample may not even be ﬂagged as malicious due to
evasion techniques being utilized. By performing statistical analysis and reducing the data
through clustering, even samples that avoid initial sandbox detection can potentially be
detected as malicious. There is clearly a need for more advanced analytical systems to
identify campaigns and link the samples together.
Identifying today’s threats requires multiple layers of protection at various points across the
network, along with constantly updated threat intelligence information. Cisco analyzes a
massive amount of telemetry data and is able to ﬂag malware as malicious based on
multiple factors. By performing manual and programmatic analysis of sandbox data in
conjunction with identifying behaviors which are associated with malicious activity, even
unknown APT campaigns can be neutralized.
