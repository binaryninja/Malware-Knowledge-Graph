Special!!! ZeuS Botnet for Dummies
malwareint.blogspot.com/2009/07/special-zeus-botnet-for-dummies.html

After dealing with some emphasis on the activities of the most active botnets now, ZeuS, let's
see a more detailed description of their crime.
If we talk about malware and botnets, no doubt ZeuS has a particular advantage due to the
amount of zombies that are part of its campus. ZeuS is designed to steal any information that
is stored on the computers of victims remotely and carry out other attacks aimed at stealing
information such as phishing.
Therefore, we could say that ZeuS is a spyware, but also has capabilities for other types of
malware such as backdoors, trojans and viruses. However, the author mentions in the
installation manual that you don't like to call any of these forms in this crimeware, but will
refer to it as a "bot software".
Although we know the external face of ZeuS (the web interface management and control of
zombies), has certain features that are constantly evolving and professionalize achieving
greater flexibility and adaptability to ensure operation on different versions of Windows. This
makes ZeuS a latent threat and very dangerous for any information system.

In this sense, ZeuS also ensures performance "working" on the privilege level 3 (where the
applications are) the operating system to avoid incompatibilities between the implementation
of equipment and devices (which operate at lower levels). Though it may seem an irrelevant
fact, this allows greater flexibility and hence a higher yield at the time of the fraudulent and
criminal activities for which it was conceived.
The latest version of ZeuS is written with version 9 of the C + + language, and among the
features that have this web application (malicious), we can mention:

Monitor network traffic (sniffer) TCP.

Intercepts the FTP and POP3 connections from any port.
Intercepts HTTP and HTTPS requests from all applications that work with the library
wininet.dll (eg IE). This demystifies the myth in which ZeuS uses a BHO to intercept
applications through IE.
Functions server (socks4/4a/5).
Backconnect for all of the infected computer services (RDP, Socks, FTP, etc.).
Get screenshots in real time.
Ability to conduct phishing attacks.
Incorporates anti-analysis mechanisms.
Constructor of the trojan that spreads and configuration file.
Polymorphic encryption.
Another technical detail is that all communication is done by ZeuS through a symmetric
encryption algorithm (RC4).

The server is the heart of ZeuS, and

any botnet, and who is to obtain all records of infected computers that are part of the botnet
and execute commands remotely.

On the other hand, many botnets

using virtual servers to their criminal operations. However, this plays against the botnet when
is very large, if ZeuS, as usually, the virtual servers don't have too many resources, so it's
customary for botmaster using dedicated servers to host the bot. This is an important fact to
keep in mind during the research side.
Accordingly, and as every application requires a minimum of resources to run satisfactorily, in
the case of this botnet, the requirements are just to have 2GB of RAM and 2x frequency of 2
GHz CPU. As we see, the minimum requirements aren't at all a constraint VIP. Anyone can
implement ZeuS, even without these minimum requirements.
Furthermore, it's assumed that the computer is running an HTTP server with PHP (the
language is generally develop these crimeware) and MySQL (to create the database with
statistical information that shows your activity). Another requirement is Zend Optimizer, which
is necessary to protect and optimize the scripts.
With regard to updates, ZeuS is also can be "groomed" by newer versions without too much
effort. During the last six months have been released five versions (based on each one
approx. 35 days) with correction of errors, changes and new features, not the versions with
smaller arrangements.

After looking at the diagram, many wonder what the number of each version. A teaching
mode could say that if we have the "A.B.C.D" ...
A means a complete package of crimeware.
B represents changes that cause total or partial incompatibility with earlier versions.
C specifies error correction, added functionality, improvements, etc..
D is the number of refuds (changes) to the current version.
This is just a screenshot of what can and ZeuS represents in terms of skills and maneuvers
that have an environment within which criminal crimeware applications are the main actors.
