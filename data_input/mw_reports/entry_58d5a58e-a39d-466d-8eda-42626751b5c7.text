Attackers are promoting sites impersonating the Microsoft Store, Spotify, and an online
document converter that distribute malware to steal credit cards and passwords saved in
web browsers.
The attack was discovered by cybersecurity firm ESET who issued a warning yesterday on
Twitter to be on the lookout for the malicious campaign.
In a conversation with Jiri Kropac, ESET's Head of Threat Detection Labs,
BleepingComputer learned that the attack is conducted through malicious advertising that
promotes what appears to be legitimate applications.
For example, one of the advertisements used in this attack promotes an online Chess
application, as shown below.

Malicious advertisement promoting a fake Chess app
However, when users click on the ad, they are brought to a fake Microsoft Store page for a
fake 'xChess 3' online chess application, which is automatically downloaded from an Amazon
AWS server.
The downloaded zip file is named 'xChess_v.709.zip' [VirusTotal], which is actually the the
'Ficker', or 'FickerStealer,' information-stealing malware in disguise, as shown by
this Any.Run report created by BleepingComputer.

Fake Microsoft Store page distributing the Ficker malware
Other advertisements from this malware campaign pretend to be for Spotify (shown below)
or an online document converter. When visited, their landing pages will also automatically
download a zip file containing the Ficker malware.

Fake Spotify landing page
Once a user unzips the file and launches the executable, instead of being greeted by a new
online Chess application or the Spotify software, the Ficker malware will run and begin
stealing the data stored on their computer.

What is the Ficker malware
Ficker is an information-stealing Trojan released on Russian-speaking hacker forums in
January when the developer began renting out the malware to other threat actors.
In a forum post, the developer describes the malware's capabilities and allows other threat
actors to rent the software from anyone from one week up to six months.

A forum post marketing the FickerStealer malware
Using this malware, threat actors can steal saved credentials in web browsers, desktop
messaging clients (Pidgin, Steam, Discord), and FTP clients.
In addition to stealing passwords, the developer claims the malware can steal over fifteen
cryptocurrency wallets, steal documents, and take screenshots of the active applications
running on victims' computers.
This information is then compiled into a zip file and transmitted back to the attacker, where
they can then extract the data and use it for other malicious activities.
Due to the Ficker malware's extensive functionality, victims of this campaign should
immediately change their online passwords, check firewalls for suspicious port forwarding
rules, and perform a thorough antivirus scan of your computer to check for additional
malware.
