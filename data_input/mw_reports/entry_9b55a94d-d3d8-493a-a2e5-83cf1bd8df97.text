Recently, the Phishing Defense Center (PDC) has observed a trend relative to a phishing
tactic involving missed voicemail messages. As illustrated below in figure 1, the end user is
notified about a missed voice message from a British Telecom landline. The link directs the
recipient to a website that isn’t in any way associated with BT or any other legitimate telecom
service.

Once this malicious link is accessed, the recipient is directed to the landing page seen in
figure 2. This page purports to be the BT sign-in page, spoofing the BT logo and reminding
the recipient of their missed messages. One minor detail worth noting is that the number of
voice messages pending has changed from one to three. This is likely due to the same mass
phishing mail being sent out with the parameter of one voice message, and the pre-set
HTML code in the phishing page being set to three. A slight oversight on the part of the
threat actor, but the page remains convincing, nevertheless.
Once the recipient has entered their details, this information is exfiltrated to an external
private address. As is observable from the URL bar of figure 2, the corresponding URL could
hardly be more clearly not the BT sign-in page.

Figure 2: Landing Page
As with many phishing landing pages, regardless of the details entered, the page will redirect
back to the target companies’ home page. This event campaign is no different. Once
credentials are entered and data stolen, the recipient is directed straight to the official BT
help page. This is done to boost perceptions of “legitimacy.”

Missed voice messages as a phishing tactic continues to be a trend, leads to one conclusion:
A high success rate. The landing page or provider will change depending on the targeted
region but one thing remains certain. The tactic will continue in tandem with the threat actor
success.
