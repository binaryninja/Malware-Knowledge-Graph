Introducing the Leery Turtle APT Group
Leery Turtle is a threat group which is active since at least late 2017. They are targeting Cryptocurrency
Exchange companies globally. They continuously carry out spear-phishing campaigns to infect their targets with
custom written malware. The forensic analysis concludes that this group is systematically operated, persistent,
and funded.

Targets and Capabilities
All of the campaigns observed were directed towards Cryptocurrency Exchange companies. Leery Turtle does
not focus on any particular region, and target businesses worldwide. they mostly target technical and executive
roles.
In their operations, Leery Turtle employs extensive reconnaissance tactics. To specify vulnerable entry points,
they send decoy e-mails with non-malicious attachments and monitor which of their targets tend to open and
download them. The evidence also suggests that Leery Turtle selects and profiles their targets at an advanced
level to the details of their private life.
Attacks imitate commonly used file storage services like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive etc. This mimicking
behavior also observed in their choice of domains. They also use e-mail spoofing techniques to make the emails appear as coming from a coworker.

II. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF KEY ATTACKS
Activity Summary
Steps of an attack are like the following:
1. A password-protected PDF file is sent alongside an LNK shortcut that imitates a text file containing the pdf’s
password.
2. When double-clicked the shortcut file sends an HTTP request to a remote server through Windows utility
mshta.exe. This request is intended to download and execute the first stage payload.
3. The attacker’s web server responds with a VBS payload which will be executed. Additional controls on the
server-side are present. For example, we have observed that the server is checking if the user agent string is
matching with MSHTA.
4. We observed that the webserver is always running on TCP 8080.
5. The first stage payload gathers information about the infected system and sends them to the command and
control server.
6. CNC server responds with a Second Stage VBS payload, which will be saved under the %TEMP% directory.
7. Malware creates a shortcut file named ‘xBoxOne.lnk’ under the Startup directory as a means of persistence.

MALWARE ANALYSIS
LNK Shortcut File - Password.txt.lnk
Initial LNK file is a simple shortcut that downloads & executes VBS code from a remote server using Microsoft’s
system utility MSHTA. It is observed that attackers use the URL shortening service “bit.ly” at every stage of the
operation.

File Dropping and Persistency - First Stage Downloader
It can be seen that malware is dropping files in the below code snippet. The malware contains a Base64
encoded code which then gets decoded and dropped under %Temp% directory with .vbs extension. After that,
it creates another shortcut file under the Startup directory as a means of persistence.

Checking for Security Products - First Stage Downloader
Malware enumerates the list of processes by interacting with WMI. After that, it checks for the presence of
several Antivirus products. In case Qihoo360 Total Security, a Chinese AV product, is present then it deletes the
shortcut under Startup which it created a while back. Therefore malware does not persist on the system if this
security product is present.

Information Gathering Through WMI – Second Stage Malware
The malware gathers plenty of information about the local system through WMI. It is observed that this
information is later sent to the CnC server by the malware.

Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration",,48)

Command and Control Communication – Second Stage Malware
It is observed that malware has two different communication methods to receive commands. The first method is
simply receiving commands in Base64 encoded format. CNC responses beginning with “23#” are using this
method.
The second one is a bit more complicated. This time malware will receive a second URL from the CNC. Then it
will send a GET request to this URL. The second server will respond with an encrypted payload and decryption
key. We believe that this mechanism is meant to be a more resilient commanding system. CNC responses
beginning with “20#” are using this method.
1. Simple Communication Method

2. Dead-Drop Communication Method
