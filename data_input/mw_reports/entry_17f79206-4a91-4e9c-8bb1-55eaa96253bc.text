More than 780,000 email accounts compromised by the now-defunct Emotet malware gang
have been re-secured by their respective owners, cybersecurity organization Spamhaus said
last month.
The email accounts were compromised after users were tricked into infecting their
computers with the Emotet malware.
Using automated scripts, the Emotet malware dumped passwords from browsers and
email clients, accessed victimsâ€™ email accounts, and hijacked old email threads by
sending new messages to known contacts containing malicious Office documents
laced with malware in order to make new victims.
When authorities seized and shut down the servers used by the Emotet gang in
January 2021, they also gained access to the list of emails the criminal group had been
using to spread their malware.
The list is believed to contain 4,324,770 email addresses, according to a copy the FBI
provided to Troy Hunt, the security researcher behind the Have I Been Pwned service.
In a blog post last month, Spamhaus said it also received a smaller list of 1.3 million
email addresses compromised by Emotet, from a law enforcement partner.

Since mid-April, the organization had reached out to the companies and email service
providers behind the addresses, asking them to re-secure accounts by resetting their
passwords.
In total, Spamhaus said it reached out to 22,000 domain owners and 3,000
organizations to whom the compromised 1.3 million email addresses belonged to.
Two months later, Spamhaus said that more than 60% of the 1.3 million addresses
have now been re-secured.
This was a very important step because the owners of the Emotet malware are still at
large, and access to those email accounts could be sold to other criminal organizations
or used by the Emotet gang if they decide to come back.
However, many other email accounts remain compromised. End users and companies
can check if their email addresses had been seen in Emotet email campaigns using
the Have I Been Pwned service or a special website created by Dutch police.
