Protecting Against WinRAR Vulnerabilities

A 19 year old, yet major, vulnerability was recently found by Check Point Research in the
popular web application, WinRAR, that could potentially put over 500 million users at risk.
The exploit works by simply extracting an archive from an innocent looking ACE file which
could lead to a remote code execution.
Following the discovery, it was not long at all before the Check Point Research team, as
well as a researcher from NCC Group, spotted malware sample leveraging this vulnerability
in the wild. In this case, the malware is an ace archive containing a JS file that is, in turn,
written to startup. It will download and run an executable when initiated. The downloaded
executable is a .NET RAT called Orcus.
Fortunately, Check Point customers were already protected against this type of attack
before the publication of this WinRAR vulnerability was made last week. By taking a closer
look at how Check Point SandBlast Agent works we can get a better understanding of both
the attack and protection against it.

whole attack) highlighting the script drop and execution upon reboot. (Click here for the full
report).
The attack begins by the user extracting an archive using WinRAR believing he is extracting
a rbxm file which is a 3D model for Roblox, a popular online gaming platform. In addition to
the 3D model, there is a hidden JS file with custom path to user’s startup folder as
highlighted below.

Meanwhile, we can see from the Sand Blast Agent Forensics report that the JS payload file
is actually extracted to the user’s start-up folder where it will then be launched once the
user reboots the machine or simply logs off and logs back on.

SandBlast Agent is able to catch such activity through the SandBlast Agent Behavioral
Guard protection name Gen.Win.WrarExp.A.
By performing Advanced Behavioral Analysis along with threat extraction and sandboxing
techniques remotely on public or private cloud servers, SandBlast Agent is able to use a
low-overhead, non-intrusive approach to protect users against modern malware techniques.
The exploitation of vulnerabilities in such commonly used applications like WinRAR
highlights once again how easily users can be exposed to malware when downloading files.
By doing so, they can inadvertently put an enterprise’s entire IT network at risk of infection.
When suspicious events do occur, it is essential that organizations have immediate access
to the information required to fully understand and triage attacks to quickly identify source
and scope, and to determine the best path of resolution.
Check Point SandBlast Agent is a progressive new solution that extends advanced threat
prevention to endpoint devices to defend against zero-day and targeted threats. With the
capture and automatic analysis of complete forensics data, SandBlast Agent provides
actionable attack insight and context to enable rapid remediation in the event of a breach.
