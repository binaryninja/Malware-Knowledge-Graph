InfoStealer Deployed in a Massive Supply Chain Attack
An ongoing supply chain attack has been reported, targeting customers of 3CX, a VoIP IPBX software
development company. This attack has been attributed to North Korean Threat Actors (TAs). Currently,
the 3CX DesktopApp can be accessed on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and
mobile.
However, reports have indicated that the ongoing activity related to the supply chain attack has been
detected on both Windows and macOS operating systems. The attack involves a Trojanized version of
the 3CX, a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) desktop client, which has been digitally signed. 3CX’s
Phone System is utilized by over 600,000 companies globally and has over 12 million daily users.
The highlights of the incident are as follows:
On March 29, a significant number of EDR providers and antivirus solutions began to identify and
signal a warning for the legitimate 3CXDesktopApp.exe binary, which was signed.
This binary had initiated an update procedure that ultimately led to malicious activity and
communication with Command-and-Control servers.
The 3CX download that was accessible on the official public website was infected with malware.
Systems that had already been installed would undergo updates that would ultimately result in the
download of this malware.
The attack involves a multi-stage process that starts with the 3CX desktop application.
The process of retrieving malicious payloads from GitHub involves a delay of 7 days before the
download takes place. This delay could be an attempt to evade detection by security systems
monitoring suspicious activities.

As per reports, the last stage of the attack involves stealing information. This malware can gather
system data and take control of data and login credentials stored in user profiles on various web
browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox.
Both the Windows and macOS installers for 3CX have been impacted.
As per researchers, the evidence from GitHub indicates that the infrastructure utilized by the
Windows variant was activated on December 7, 2022.
Additionally, the domains and web infrastructure utilized in the attacks were registered as early as
November 2022.
The 3CX Phone Management System can be implemented on-premises. Upon further investigation, we
found that over 240,000 publicly exposed instances of this application.
The figure below shows the Shodan search results.

We also came across a Reddit post where a user reported suspicious activity that occurred after updating
the 3CX desktop on March 24, 2023. According to the user, the 3cxdesktopapp.exe program accessed
browser caches, as revealed by EDR file history data.

According to 3CX, the recent attack was a result of infected bundled libraries that were compiled into the
Windows Electron App through GIT. The vendor has also stated, “Electron Windows App shipped in
Update 7, version numbers 18.12.407 & 18.12.416, includes a security issue. Anti-Virus vendors have
flagged the executable 3CXDesktopApp.exe and in many cases uninstalled it. Electron Mac App version
numbers 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 & 18.12.416 are also affected.”
The .msi file, when executed, drops two malicious files – “ffmpeg.dll” and “d3dcompiler_47.dll” – in the
location C:\Users[user_name]\AppData\Local\Programs\3CXDesktopApp\app.
The infection begins when the benign file “3CXDesktopApp.exe” loads “ffmpeg.dll”. Then, “ffmpeg.dll”
decrypts the encrypted code from “d3dcompiler_47.dll”, which seems to be a shellcode.
This shellcode loads another DLL file that tries to access the IconStorages GitHub page to find an .ico file
containing the encrypted Command-and-Control (C&C) server. After locating the C&C server, the
backdoor establishes a connection to retrieve the potential final payload.
The figure below shows the infection flow.

Technical Analysis
The MSI package installer that has been compromised has a digital signature, and its appearance
resembles that of a legitimate file, as shown below.

Upon installation, the MSI package installer drops files such as “3CXDesktopApp.exe”, “ffmpeg.dll”, and
“d3dcompiler_47.dll” in the %LocalAppData% directory of the system.
%LocalAppData%\Programs\3CXDesktopApp\app\
These files are associated with malicious behavior and are accompanied by other supporting files.
The figure below displays the directory where the “3CXDesktopApp” application has been installed.

Figure 5 – 3CXDesktop installation folder
After installation, the “3CXDesktopApp.exe” file is executed, which is usually benign but can be utilized to
load the malicious DLL, as shown below.

The figure below illustrates the process tree of the “3CXDesktopApp” application.

Figure 7 – Process tree
The “3CXDesktopApp.exe” loads the “ffmpeg.dll” file, which is a malicious DLL that has been specifically
designed to read, load, and execute harmful shellcode from the “d3dcompiler_47.dll” file.
When executed, the “ffmpeg.dll” creates a new event, “AVMonitorRefreshEvent“, identifies the current file
path, and searches for the next file in the sequence, which is “d3dcompiler_47.dll”. Once identified, the
“ffmpeg.dll” loads the “d3dcompiler_47.dll” file into memory, as illustrated in the assembly code shown
below.

Figure 8 – ffmpeg.dll file is loading d3dcompiler_47.dll
Although the loaded “d3dcompiler_47.dll” is signed by Microsoft, it has an encrypted payload embedded
within it. The “ffmpeg.dll” file now identifies the encrypted payload indicated by a particular marker,
‘0xCEFAEDFE’, as shown below.

Figure 9 – Identifying encrypted payload in “d3dcompiler_47.dl”l
Once the encrypted payload has been identified, the “ffmpeg.dll” proceeds to decrypt the RC4 stream
using the key “3jB(2bsG#@c7“. This decryption process results in a shellcode which is then executed by
the DLL file.
The figure below shows the RC4 loop and decrypted shellcode function.

Figure 10 – RC4 loop and decrypted shellcode
After decryption, the “ffmpeg.dll” file employs the VirtualProtect() function to alter the memory access
permissions of the shellcode. Once the permissions have been changed, the malware proceeds to
execute the payload.
An embedded DLL file is present within the decrypted shellcode, as shown in the below figure, which
appears to be functioning as a loader for another PE file.

Figure 11 – Embedded DLL file inside Shellcode
After being loaded and executed, the embedded DLL file in the shellcode initiates a sleep state of 7 days
before trying to establish communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers. Subsequently, the
DLL will attempt to access a GitHub repository that contains an .ICO file.

Figure 12 – Hardcoded GitHub link to download the .ICO file
This ICO file comprises the encrypted C&C strings, which are encoded using Base64 and encrypted with
AES & GCM encryption. The Base64 contents are located at the end of the ICO image file, as shown
below.

Figure 13 – Base64-encoded string at the end of ICO file
Upon execution, the DLL file decrypts the C&C URLs from the ICO files for downloading additional
payloads from the remote server. To obtain distinct C&C URLs, the malware randomly selects an ICO file
from a GitHub repository. Unfortunately, we were unable to verify the specific characteristics of these
payloads as the corresponding GitHub repository was taken down prior to this analysis.
Researchers discovered that the final stage of malware is a stealer, which can extract system information
and steal sensitive information from popular web browsers, such as Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox.

Conclusion
The potential damage caused by the 3CXDesktopApp supply chain attack is significant, including the
theft of sensitive user data. Organizations affected by this attack should immediately take steps to
prevent it from causing widespread harm. The current investigation suggests that the threat actor behind
this attack is skilled and persistent.
The consequences of such an attack, such as financial loss, reputational impact, and the loss of
customer trust, are severe. It is crucial that organizations remain vigilant and take proactive measures to
secure their supply chains to prevent similar attacks in the future.
