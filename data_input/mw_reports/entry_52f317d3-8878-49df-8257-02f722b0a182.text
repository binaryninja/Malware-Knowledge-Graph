1/11

On September 7, 2021, a representative of the Groove ransomware syndicate shared
their experience-based perspective on inner aspects of ransomware business,
including the “truth” about the association of Babuk, DarkSide, and BlackMatter, and
other insights on the inner relationships within the ransomware community.
Groove representative is likely a threat actor operating under the alias “SongBird”
(obfuscated) that is known to be a former Babuk operator and creator of an
underground ransomware-centered digital platform RAMP which is entirely dedicated
to providing coordination, communication, and organizational support for the top cyber
extortionists.
The actor’s decision to share their insights was triggered by the reported disclosure of
what was claimed to be “Babuk’s source code” released on September 3, 2021, by the
actor operating under the alias “DY-2” (obfuscated). The incident caused a massive
backlash from the underground community which once again provoked the release of
the blog by SongBird.
The actor claims that they wish to address the issue of constant misinformation and
misreporting originating from the Twitter community covering the ransomware subject.
“SongBird” also denies any associations between DarkSide and BlackMatter except
that two ransomware share the same source code that “most likely has been
purchased from one of the DarkSide affiliates.”
Background

On September 7, 2021, a representative of the newly-formed Groove ransomware syndicate
decided to share their insights and their perspective on the inner aspects of the ransomware
business.

Groove ransomware was announced by a former Babuk operator and a founder of an
underground forum RAMP. Groove data leak website currently has one victim, a
manufacturing company based in Germany, whose exfiltrated data was published on August
27, 2021.

The Groove representative primarily focused on discussing the inner relationships within the
ransomware community.

“Hello! Lately, some of the researchers on “Twitter” began dumping tons of flawed
information (about ransomware). As a direct participant of recent events, I want to bring
clarity as some to make sure that the truth is presented to future generations”

Actor “SongBird”

Groove representative is likely a threat actor operating under the alias “SongBird”
(obfuscated) that is known to be a former Babuk operator and creator of an underground
ransomware-centered digital platform RAMP.

RAMP forum was launched on July 11, 2021, and was initially based on the former Babuk’s
data leak website domain. Soon after the forum was relocated to the new domain where it
successfully operates to this date. The forum is entirely dedicated to providing coordination,
communication, and organizational support for the top cyber extortionists.

3/11

RAMP forum, 10 days in. Threat actor “SongBird” discusses the Registration Policy. Soon
after the forum administrators implemented a new rule requiring new members to be
screened and accepted by the forum moderator.

Groove is a novel ransomware group that became especially active in August and
September 2021. Groove allegedly employs former Babuk developers and possesses
advanced tactics and tools. For instance, on September 7, 2021, the same day as the
publication of the “Ransomware Thoughts” Groove released leaks of Fortinet VPN SSL
credentials via their leak website. The list contains 799 directories and 86,941 purportedly
compromised VPN connections. The reason behind the leak is unclear.

The breach list contains raw access to the top companies.

4/11

The geographical distribution of the Fortinet VPN SSL list includes 74 countries. 2,959 out of
22,500 victims are US entities.

Babuk VS Groove. Ransomware Drama
5/11

1. Babuk Beginning - the Development of Ransomware

According to the actor, at the end of summer (the year is unclear), they were approached by
another member of the underground with an offer to work on the development of
ransomware which later was presented as Babuk. The source code was successfully
modified and soon after tested against two manufacturing companies based in Europe, as
well as other businesses whose names the author did not disclose as these victims “paid the
ransom and fulfilled their contract, while we fulfilled ours” meaning that they can not share
any information regarding the attacks. They conclude “everything worked for me, the product
was satisfying.”

2. “The Netherlands Cheese Crisis” Causing The Rift Within the Syndicate

Soon after, in early April 2020, Babuk attacked a Dutch transport company, possibly using a
Microsoft Exchange server CVE (which has been particularly trending as an attack vector for
ransomware groups in April and May 2020). The attack has led to the supply chain disruption
and the limited availability of prepackaged cheese in the Netherlands.

“SongBird” shares that due to the poor development of the source code, operators weren’t
able to successfully decrypt the files and return the data even though the victim was
reportedly willing to pay the ransom. This turned Babuk’s for-profit operation into a simple
damaging and destructive attack with no benefit and compromised the group’s reputation.
According to the Groove representative, the code was poorly written on purpose and they
are still struggling to identify the motives behind it.

3. Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department Attack that Led to the Split of
Babuk Team

According to the blog, one of the ransomware affiliates contacted Babuk offering access to
the police department. The ransomware attack occurred in May of 2021 when Babuk
operators demanded $4 million USD in exchange for the decryption key. After a short period

6/11

of negotiation and refusal of their victim to pay a ransom, the syndicate started to release
what it claimed to be internal law enforcement data. The negotiation process ended in failure.

SongBird claims that the negotiation failed due to the lack of pressure and
“unprofessionalism” by their affiliate. The actor then decided to end the business relationship
with their former “colleagues”. It was agreed that SongBird would keep the domain (where
the threat actor later built RAMP forum) where the shame blog was based, while their affiliate
would keep the source code.

7/11

The attack on the police department became the turning point that led the initial team of the
Babuk syndicate to disintegration. According to SongBird, they lost half of their team and
were struggling to keep the domain, which was attacked by their former syndicate members.
Soon after SongBird was forced to relocate RAMP. 15 days prior to the official opening of the
forum, the actor added:

“The old team causes trouble. We agreed that they would take their source code and I would
take the domain. Don't try to hurt me, I know your skills and what you are capable of as well
as my skills too. If you keep interfering in my business I will start working against you (I have
insiders).”

4. From Colleagues to Enemies - Babuk Source Code Leak

On September 3, 2021, a threat actor operating under the alias "DY-2" (obfuscated)
released what they claimed to be Babuk’s source code also stating that they are doing it as
they face a terminal stage of cancer. The actor "DY-2" in fact might be that initial syndicate
member who approached “SongBird” with the request to improve the source code - an event
that led to a Babuk ransomware development. (see point 1 - “Babuk Beginning”).

8/11

“DY-2” intentions to release the source code might have been a desire for simple revenge for
their former colleague that quickly became one of the main competitors in the ransomware
business. “SongBird” in turn mentioned actor "DY-2" in their debut passage and claims that in
reality the actor does not have a cancer diagnosis and is deliberately misleading the
underground community. They did not provide any further comments on the legitimacy of the
source code itself, however.

One of the alleged developers of Babuk ransomware created a major discussion across the
underground forums when they claimed that due to cancer they are willing to share Babuk’s
source code. The news was quickly transferred by English-speaking social media.

5. Epilogue - DarkSide & BlackMatter

“SongBird” denies any associations between DarkSide and BlackMatter except that two
ransomware share the same source code that “most likely has been purchased from one of
the DarkSide affiliates”
They believe that BlackMatter has been initiated by some of the older affiliates of DarkSide.
However, AdvIntel’s visibility into BlackMatter operation suggests that the group
institutionalizes the mechanisms which were practiced not by DarkSide’s affiliates, but by
DarkSide’s core leadership. Specifically, DarkSide founders were reportedly scamming their
affiliates by intercepting victim negotiations and squeezing the affiliate of the process of
obtaining ransom from the victim. This enabled the DarkSide founders to receive the entire
ransom payment and not provide affiliates with their percentage share.

9/11

DarkSide performed this scheme by indirectly controlling the victim’s negotiations chats and
creating hidden chats in which they continued negotiations, while the affiliate’s chat was
blacked as if the victim was not responding. BlackMatter institutionalized this scheme openly
stating within their panel that they have an ultimate right to intercept any victim chat and
seize the negotiations from the affiliate at any point. This initialization of affiliate scamming
schemes suggests that BlackMatter is more likely founded by the DarkSide core team and
not by their affiliates as suggested by “SongBird”.

Conclusion

The blog released by the Groove representative is a missing piece of a puzzle that allowed
us to build a better picture of the Groove and Babuk conflict and take a closer look at the
ransomware ecosystem.

The personal disagreement between actors (most likely “SongBird” and "DY-2") that
developed within the syndicate led to the withdrawal from the group of one of them and to
the establishment of a new brand Groove. As both syndicates continue to exist, we are likely
to see more drama coming our way.

This state of affairs demonstrates a complex ransomware ecosystem where new groups
emerge as a result of the competition within larger gangs that fall apart and due to inner
conflicts, while older groups attempt to rebrand in order to institutionalize the paradigms
which they considered operationally existential.

Mitigations & Recommendations:

Groove group consists of ransomware specialists who have been extensively using the
following attack vectors - RDPs, Infrastructure Vulnerabilities, Software framework
vulnerabilities.

Based on these vectors, AdvIntel recommends addressing the following set of vulnerabilities.

10/11

1. Monitor externally exposed RDPs and RDP access sold on major underground
marketplaces.
2. Monitor infrastructure vulnerabilities, especially Fortinet VPN SSL.
3. Apply patching and rapid security updates for ransomware-exploited CVEs, specifically
ProxyLogon, latest Microsoft Exchange server CVEs, and OWA server CVEs.
