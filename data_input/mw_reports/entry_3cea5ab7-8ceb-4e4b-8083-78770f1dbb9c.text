REvil Overview
• Ransomware, first discovered by Cisco in April 2019
• Functional/technical similarities to GandCrab; likely at least
some of same operators
• Operators known as Gold Southfield and Pinchy Spider
• “The Crown Prince of Ransomware”
• Do not target Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) or
Syria
• Operate/maintain leak site
• Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs):
o Leverages whitelists and blacklists for target file selection
o Ransomware-as-a-Service
o Managed Service Provider (MSP) compromise
o Big game hunting
o Phishing (embedded macros, compressed JavaScript file,
executables), PowerShell, C2, RDP compromise,
compromised message forums, Cobalt Strike, software
vulnerabilities, exploit kits
• Distributed-denial-of-service attacks to increase pressure to pay
• Current status: Unknown

3

History of GandCrab
• Origin: Revil/Sodinokibi is believed to have began as Gandcrab
o Initial operations in January 2018
o Demanded payments in Dash cryptocurrency
o Frequently/aggressively updated code; often communicated to and recruited affiliates via Exploit[.]in
o Five major revisions to the code, many more minor updates
o “…[E]asily the most rapacious and predatory malware of 2018 and well into 2019." – Brian Krebs,
cybersecurity journalist
o On May 31, 2019, they announced they were terminating the program

4

History of GandCrab, Part 2
• They bragged of earning over
$2 billion in extortion payouts
from victims; average weekly
project income was $2.5
million
• Kaspersky Lab estimated that
GandCrab accounted for half
of the global ransomware
market.
• GandCrab bragged that an
affiliate infected 27,031 victims
in a month, receiving $125,000
in commissions.

5

REvil: A Continuation of GandCrab
What are the connections between REvil and GandCrab?
• According to Cisco, in April 2019 REvil actors deployed REvil followed by Gandcrab in the same attack
• GandCrab operators “retire” a month later
• Cisco, SecureWorks and Brian Krebs all examined the GandCrab and REvil code, and have publicly
stated they believe the same group is responsible for both
• Code comparison: several components are similar
o SecureWorks has even implied that REvil was directly developed from a version of GandCrab
• “Unknown” deposited $130K in two cybercrime forums to demonstrate credibility, requested affiliates for
new ransomware-as-a-service operation, and claimed five years of experience in the field

Revil: Who They Are Today
• REvil continue to go big game hunting and target managed service providers
• Have made recent headlines: Kaseya and JSB
• Still prolific and aggressive, as the Coveware data below substantiates:

10

REvil: Who They Are Today, Part 2
IBM data:
• REvil made up 22% of all IBM incident response engagements in 2020
• Estimates nearly 60% of the gang’s victims are from the United States

11

REvil: Who They Are Today, Part 3
Additional IBM data:
• REvil’s ransom demands are high and generally increasing over time:

12

REvil: Who They Are Today, Part 4
Continuous creative thinking and capability development:
• Known to sponsor hacking contests where the winner claims thousands of dollars and a job with/for them
• Have discussed notifying major stock exchanges after compromises in order to increase pressure to pay
ransom
• Shifted to Monero from Bitcoin in early 2020
o Combination of TOR and privacy coins make transactions virtually impossible to trace
• Developed ability to encrypt open and locked files
• Inspired by Maze ransomware operators, developed and maintain leak site
• Scanning for point-of-sale systems in victim networks for additional monetization of attacks

Disable the use of SMBv1 (and all other vulnerable services and protocols) and
require at least SMBv2. Restricting/Minimizing/eliminating RDP usage.

[7.S.A], [7.M.D]

26

The Future
• REvil operations have recently ceased, and their website disappeared from the dark web.
o Speculation that they are lying low; or that they quit and formed BlackMatter.
• Disappearance likely due to the high-profile ransomware attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure, and the
resulting discussions between the highest levels of the U.S. and Russian governments.
• Russian hacker forums have banned them and other ransomware operators from advertising, but this is not
expected to seriously impede them.
• Due to the unwillingness of Russian law enforcement to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts, it is unlikely
that there were or will be any legal penalties issued to REvil members in the near future.
• However they are organized in the future:
o The individuals involved in REvil will most likely continue as ransomware operators.
o The relationships REvil had with other cyber criminals will most likely be preserved.
o The technology that REvil developed will continue to be utilized and built upon.
