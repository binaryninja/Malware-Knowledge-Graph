Initial Access

T1566.001 – Phishing:
Spearphishing
Attachment:
Adversaries may send
spearphishing emails
with a malicious
attachment in an attempt
to gain access to victim
systems. Spearphishing
attachment is a specific
variant of spearphishing.
Spearphishing
attachment is different
from other forms of
spearphishing in that it
employs the use of
malware attached to an
email. All forms of
spearphishing are
electronically delivered
social engineering
targeted at a specific
individual, company, or
industry.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can also
automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion prevention systems
and systems designed to scan and
remove malicious email attachments
can be used to block activity.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based
Content:
Block unknown or unused
attachments by default that should
not be transmitted over email as a
best practice to prevent some
vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl,
etc. Some email scanning devices
can open and analyze compressed
and encrypted formats, such as zip
and rar that may be used to conceal
malicious attachments.

2/16

M1054 - Software Configuration:
Use anti-spoofing and email
authentication mechanisms to filter
messages based on validity checks
of the sender domain (using SPF)
and integrity of messages (using
DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms
within an organization (through
policies such as DMARC) may
enable recipients (intra-org and cross
domain) to perform similar message
filtering and validation.
M1017 - User Training:
Users can be trained to identify social
engineering techniques and
spearphishing emails.
Execution

T1059.007 – Command
and Scripting Interpreter:
JavaScript:

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:

Adversaries may abuse
various implementations
of JavaScript for
execution. JavaScript
(JS) is a platformindependent scripting
language (compiled justin-time at runtime)
commonly associated
with scripts in webpages,
though JS can be
executed in runtime
environments outside the
browser.

On Windows 10,
enable Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR) rules
to prevent JavaScript
scripts from executing
potentially malicious
downloaded content.

M1042 - Disable or Remove Feature
or Program:
Turn off or restrict access to
unneeded scripting components.

3/16

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Denylist scripting where appropriate.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based
Content:
Script blocking extensions can help
prevent the execution of JavaScript
and HTA files that may commonly be
used during the exploitation process.
For malicious code served up
through ads, adblockers can help
prevent that code from executing in
the first place.
T1106 – Native Application
Programming Interface (API)

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to prevent
Office VBA macros from
calling Win32 APIs.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Identify and block potentially
malicious software executed that may
be executed through this technique
by using application control tools, like
Windows Defender Application
Control, AppLocker, or Software
Restriction Policies where
appropriate.
T1047 – Windows Management
Instrumentation:
Adversaries may abuse Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI)
to execute malicious commands and
payloads. WMI is an administration
feature that provides a uniform
environment to access Windows
system components.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
processes created by
WMI commands from
running. Note: many
legitimate tools and
applications utilize WMI
for command execution.

4/16

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control configured to
block execution of wmic.exe if it is not
required for a given system or
network to prevent potential misuse
by adversaries. For example, in
Windows 10 and Windows Server
2016 and above, Windows Defender
Application Control (WDAC) policy
rules may be applied to block the
wmic.exe application and to prevent
abuse.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Prevent credential overlap across
systems of administrator and
privileged accounts.
M1018 - User Account Management:
By default, only administrators are
allowed to connect remotely using
WMI. Restrict other users who are
allowed to connect, or disallow all
users to connect remotely to WMI.
T1569.002 – System Services:
Service Execution:

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:

Adversaries may abuse the Windows
service control manager to execute
malicious commands or payloads.
The Windows service control
manager (services.exe) is an
interface to manage and manipulate
services. The service control
manager is accessible to users via
GUI components as well as system
utilities such as sc.exe and Net.

On Windows 10, enable
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
processes created by
PsExec from running.

5/16

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Ensure that permissions disallow
services that run at a higher
permissions level from being created
or interacted with by a user with a
lower permission level.
M1022 - Restrict File and Directory
Permissions:
Ensure that high permission level
service binaries cannot be replaced
or modified by users with a lower
permission level.
Persistence

T1547.001 – Boot or
Logon Autostart
Execution: Registry Run
Keys / Startup Folder:
Adversaries may achieve
persistence by adding a
program to a startup
folder or referencing it
with a Registry run key.
Adding an entry to the
"run keys" in the Registry
or startup folder will
cause the program
referenced to be
executed when a user
logs in.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

6/16

T1547.006 – Boot or Logon Autostart
Execution: Kernel Modules and
Extensions:
Adversaries may modify the kernel to
automatically execute programs on
system boot. Loadable Kernel
Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code
that can be loaded and unloaded into
the kernel upon demand. They
extend the functionality of the kernel
without the need to reboot the
system. For example, one type of
module is the device driver, which
allows the kernel to access hardware
connected to the system.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Common tools for
detecting Linux rootkits
include: rkhunter,
chrootkit, although
rootkits may be designed
to evade certain
detection tools.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Application control and software
restriction tools, such as SELinux,
KSPP, grsecurity MODHARDEN, and
Linux kernel tuning can aid in
restricting kernel module loading.
Since macOS High Sierra 10.13,
Secure Kernel Extension Loading
(SKEL) can also be used to restrict
the loading of kernel modules.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Limit access to the root account and
prevent users from loading kernel
modules and extensions through
proper privilege separation and
limiting Privilege Escalation
opportunities.

7/16

Privilege Escalation

T1548.002 - Abuse
Elevation Control
Mechanism: Bypass User
Account Control:
Adversaries may bypass
UAC mechanisms to
elevate process
privileges on system.
Windows User Account
Control (UAC) allows a
program to elevate its
privileges (tracked as
integrity levels ranging
from low to high) to
perform a task under
administrator-level
permissions, possibly by
prompting the user for
confirmation.

M1047 – Audit:
Check for common
UAC bypass
weaknesses on
Windows systems to
be aware of the risk
posture and address
issues where
appropriate.

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Remove users from the local
administrator group on systems.
M1051 – Update Software:
Consider updating Windows to the
latest version and patch level to
utilize the latest protective measures
against UAC bypass.
M1052 - User Account Control:
Although UAC bypass techniques
exist, it is still prudent to use the
highest enforcement level for UAC
when possible and mitigate bypass
opportunities that exist with
techniques such as DLL Search
Order Hijacking.

8/16

T1055 – Process Injection:
Adversaries may inject code into
processes in order to evade processbased defenses as well as possibly
elevate privileges. Process injection
is a method of executing arbitrary
code in the address space of a
separate live process. Running code
in the context of another process may
allow access to the process's
memory, system/network resources,
and possibly elevated privileges.
Execution via process injection may
also evade detection from security
products since the execution is
masked under a legitimate process.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:
Some endpoint security
solutions can be
configured to block some
types of process injection
based on common
sequences of behavior
that occur during the
injection process. For
example, on Windows
10, Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR) rules
may prevent Office
applications from code
injection.

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Utilize Yama (ex:
/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope)
to mitigate ptrace based process
injection by restricting the use of
ptrace to privileged users only. Other
mitigation controls involve the
deployment of security kernel
modules that provide advanced
Defense Evasion

T1027 - Obfuscated Files
or Information:
Adversaries may attempt
to make an executable or
file difficult to discover or
analyze by encrypting,
encoding, or otherwise
obfuscating its contents
on the system or in
transit. This is common
behavior that can be
used across different
platforms and the
network to evade
defenses.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Consider utilizing the
Antimalware Scan
Interface (AMSI) on
Windows 10 to
analyze commands
after being
processed/interpreted.

9/16

M1040 - Behavior Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable Attack
Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to
prevent execution of potentially
obfuscated scripts.
T1070.004 – Indicator Removal on
Host: File Deletion:
Adversaries may delete files left
behind by the actions of their
intrusion activity. Malware, tools, or
other non-native files dropped or
created on a system by an adversary
may leave traces to indicate to what
was done within a network and how.
Removal of these files can occur
during an intrusion, or as part of a
post-intrusion process to minimize
the adversary's footprint.
T1112 – Modify Registry:
Adversaries may interact with the
Windows Registry to hide
configuration information within
Registry keys, remove information as
part of cleaning up, or as part of other
techniques to aid in persistence and
execution.

T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or
Information:
Adversaries may use Obfuscated
Files or Information to hide artifacts
of an intrusion from analysis. They
may require separate mechanisms to
decode or deobfuscate that
information depending on how they
intend to use it. Methods for doing
that include built-in functionality of
malware or by using utilities present
on the system.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse
of system features.

M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions:
Ensure proper
permissions are set for
Registry hives to prevent
users from modifying
keys for system
components that may
lead to privilege
escalation.
This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse
of system features.

10/16

T1562.001 – Impair Defenses:
Disable or Modify Tools:

M1022 - Restrict File and
Directory Permissions:

Adversaries may modify and/or
disable security tools to avoid
possible detection of their
malware/tools and activities. This
may take the many forms, such as
killing security software processes or
services, modifying / deleting
Registry keys or configuration files so
that tools do not operate properly, or
other methods to interfere with
security tools scanning or reporting
information.

Ensure proper process
and file permissions are
in place to prevent
adversaries from
disabling or interfering
with security services.

M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions:
Ensure proper Registry permissions
are in place to prevent adversaries
from disabling or interfering with
security services.
M1018 - User Account Management:
Ensure proper user permissions are
in place to prevent adversaries from
disabling or interfering with security
services.
T1497 – Virtualization/Sandbox
Evasion:
Adversaries may employ various
means to detect and avoid
virtualization and analysis
environments. This may include
changing behaviors based on the
results of checks for the presence of
artifacts indicative of a virtual
machine environment (VME) or
sandbox. If the adversary detects a
VME, they may alter their malware to
disengage from the victim or conceal
the core functions of the implant.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse
of system features.

11/16

Discovery

T1016 – System Network
Configuration Discovery:
Adversaries may look for
details about the network
configuration and
settings, such as IP
and/or MAC addresses,
of systems they access
or through information
discovery of remote
systems. Several
operating system
administration utilities
exist that can be used to
gather this information.
Examples include Arp,
ipconfig/ifconfig, nbtstat,
and route.

T1057 – Process Discovery:

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse
of system features.

Adversaries may attempt to get
information about running processes
on a system. Information obtained
could be used to gain an
understanding of common
software/applications running on
systems within the network.
Adversaries may use the information
from Process Discovery during
automated discovery to shape followon behaviors, including whether or
not the adversary fully infects the
target and/or attempts specific
actions.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

12/16

T1083 – File and Directory
Discovery:
Adversaries may enumerate files and
directories or may search in specific
locations of a host or network share
for certain information within a file
system. Adversaries may use the
information from File and Directory
Discovery during automated
discovery to shape follow-on
behaviors, including whether or not
the adversary fully infects the target
and/or attempts specific actions.
T1135 – Network Share Discovery:
Adversaries may look for folders and
drives shared on remote systems as
a means of identifying sources of
information to gather as a precursor
for Collection and to identify potential
systems of interest for Lateral
Movement. Networks often contain
shared network drives and folders
that enable users to access file
directories on various systems across
a network.
T1120 – Peripheral Device
Discovery:
Adversaries may attempt to gather
information about attached peripheral
devices and components connected
to a computer system. Peripheral
devices could include auxiliary
resources that support a variety of
functionalities such as keyboards,
printers, cameras, smart card
readers, or removable storage. The
information may be used to enhance
their awareness of the system and
network environment or may be used
for further actions.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse
of system features.

M1028 - Operating
System Configuration:
Enable Windows Group
Policy "Do Not Allow
Anonymous Enumeration
of SAM Accounts and
Shares" security setting
to limit users who can
enumerate network
shares.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse
of system features.

13/16

Command and Control

T1071.001 – Application
Layer Protocol: Web
Protocols:
Adversaries may
communicate using
application layer
protocols associated with
web traffic to avoid
detection/network filtering
by blending in with
existing traffic.
Commands to the remote
system, and often the
results of those
commands, will be
embedded within the
protocol traffic between
the client and server.

M1031 - Network
Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion
detection and
prevention systems
that use network
signatures to identify
traffic for specific
adversary malware
can be used to
mitigate activity at the
network level.

Protocols such as HTTP
and HTTPS that carry
web traffic may be very
common in
environments. HTTP/S
packets have many fields
and headers in which
data can be concealed.
An adversary may abuse
these protocols to
communicate with
systems under their
control within a victim
network while also
mimicking normal,
expected traffic.

14/16

Impact

T1486 - Data Encrypted
for Impact:
Adversaries may encrypt
data on target systems or
on large numbers of
systems in a network to
interrupt availability to
system and network
resources. They can
attempt to render stored
data inaccessible by
encrypting files or data
on local and remote
drives and withholding
access to a decryption
key.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint: On
Windows 10, enable
cloud-delivered
protection and Attack
Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
the execution of files
that resemble
ransomware.

M1053 - Data Backup: Consider
implementing IT disaster recovery
plans that contain procedures for
regularly taking and testing data
backups that can be used to restore
organizational data. Ensure backups
are stored off system and is
protected from common methods
adversaries may use to gain access
and destroy the backups to prevent
recovery. Consider enabling
versioning in cloud environments to
maintain backup copies of storage
objects.
T1490 - Inhabit System Recovery:
Adversaries may delete or remove
built-in operating system data and
turn off services designed to aid in
the recovery of a corrupted system to
prevent recovery. Operating systems
may contain features that can help fix
corrupted systems, such as a backup
catalog, volume shadow copies, and
automatic repair features.
Adversaries may disable or delete
system recovery features to augment
the effects of Data Destruction and
Data Encrypted for Impact.

M1053 - Data Backup:
Consider implementing IT
disaster recovery plans
that contain procedures
for taking regular data
backups that can be used
to restore organizational
data. Ensure backups are
stored off system and is
protected from common
methods adversaries
may use to gain access
and destroy the backups
to prevent recovery.

15/16

M1028 - Operating System
Configuration: Consider technical
controls to prevent the disabling of
services or deletion of files involved
in system recovery.
T1489 - Service Stop:
Adversaries may stop or disable
services on a system to render those
services unavailable to legitimate
users. Stopping critical services or
processes can inhibit or stop
response to an incident or aid in the
adversary's overall objectives to
cause damage to the environment.

M1030 - Network
Segmentation: Operate
intrusion detection,
analysis, and response
systems on a separate
network from the
production environment
to lessen the chances
that an adversary can
see and interfere with
critical response
functions.

M1022 - Restrict File and Directory
Permissions: Ensure proper process
and file permissions are in place to
inhibit adversaries from disabling or
interfering with critical services.
M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions: Ensure proper registry
permissions are in place to inhibit
adversaries from disabling or
interfering with critical services.
M1018 - User Account Management:
Limit privileges of user accounts and
groups so that only authorized
administrators can interact with
service changes and service
configurations.
