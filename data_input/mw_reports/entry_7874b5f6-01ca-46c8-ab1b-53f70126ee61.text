This blog post on BlueFox Stealer is an extract of the “FLINT 2022-053 – BlueFox Stealer:
a newcomer designed for traffers teams” report (SEKOIA.IO Flash Intelligence) sent to
our clients on October 20, 2022.

Introduction
In 2022, information stealers are one of the most challenging threats for both companies
and individuals. Cybercriminal threat actors distribute these malware to steal sensitive
information from infected hosts, which are then sold on underground marketplaces,
exploited for fraud (Business Email Compromise, E-Shop, Bank, Cryptocurrency theft), or
leveraged in “Big Game Hunting” operations.
Malware developers take advantage of a growing demand for MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service)
within the cybercrime ecosystem to sell their newly implemented or rebranded information
stealers. They use various underground forums, as well as Telegram channels to advertise,
manage financial transactions, and offer technical support. SEKOIA.IO monitor cybercrime
forums to discover emerging malware, among other threats.
In early September 2022, through our Dark Web monitoring routine we identified a newly
advertised malware dubbed BlueFox Stealer v2, and sold as a MaaS. Based on the ads
promoting it, the BlueFox developer implemented a stealer tailored to the needs of traffers
teams (including wide stealing capabilities, performance, efficiency, adapted to traffers
context).
Based on this information, SEKOIA.IO assess that BlueFox Stealer is possibly to be
added to the malware arsenal of traffers teams, similarly to Redline, Vidar, Raccoon
Stealer v2, Aurora Stealer or Erbium Stealer, to be distributed at a large scale. This FLINT
goes back to the emergence of BlueFox on cybercrime forums and presents a technical
overview of it.

The emergence of BlueFox Stealer on forums
Another stealer designed for traffers teams
BlueFox Stealer’s first version appeared on Russian-speaking underground forums (XSS,
BHF and DarkNet forums) in December 2021, and it was advertised by a threat actor going
by the handle distamx. The lack of interactions on its publications may suggest that the
project did not work as expected, for unknown reasons.
On 2 September 2022, the user distamx published a new post announcing version 2 of
BlueFox Stealer on the XSS forum. This time, the publication resulted in more activity,
including technical and business inquiries, positive feedback, as well as the release and
changelogs of multiple updates (versions 2.0.4 to 2.0.7) by the alleged developer.

Figure 1. Changelog of the BlueFox Stealer version 2.0.7 published on the XSS forum
Translated from Russian:
(…) 7. Added stats for build, which can be viewed without authorization (for traffers). (…)
Among notable changes, the malware developer added an interesting feature to the
administration panel of the BlueFox Stealer version 2.0.7 to allow traffers teams to operate
the malware builds internally. Thus, traffers teams distributing the BlueFox Stealer have
statistics related to each traffer (also named worker) and can give it access – making the
integration of the BlueFox Stealer easier into the traffers teams resources. In other words,
each traffer of the team can monitor statistics related to the distribution of their build on a
non-authenticated webpage, and therefore have an assessment of the impact of their work.
SEKOIA.IO observed that efforts towards facilitating the integration of stealers in the traffers
teams’ activities became common for infostealer developers. A second example is Lumma
(aka LummaC) Stealer, another emerging malware advertised on Russian-speaking forums

3/9

and sold as MaaS since August 2022. On 3 October 2022, its author Shamel published an
update intended for the traffers teams, integrating a similar feature to display statistics by
traffer.

Figure 2. Changelog of the LummaC published on the XSS forum
Translated from Russian:
Update 1. Added functionality for teams 2. Added one new widget in the panel – “statistics by
Workers”. (…)

A look at distamx’s business
The business model adopted by distamx is a classic among MaaS operators. The BlueFox
Stealer author sells its malware and the related support services for $350 per month. Based
on feedback and changelogs, distamx is very responsive to bug fixes and feature requests.
On 7 October 2022, distamx closed the sales of BlueFox Stealer v2, as the threat actor
gained enough clients for work, according to its statement. We assess that the infostealer is
under continuous development and the distamx’s workload is sufficiently high with the
malware development and the customer responsiveness. It is therefore plausible that this will
result in an increase of BlueFox activities in the near term if MaaS customers distribute it at
large scale.
It is worth mentioning that distamx also advertised the malware in a Telegram channel
(t[.]me/distamx_sup) similarly to what other MaaS operators were observed doing. BlueFox’s
presence on Telegram resulted in scams impersonating distamx to lure potential customers.
SEKOIA already observed such scams, notably for Mars Stealer, Aurora Botnet, and
Raccoon. These scams are common in the Russian-speaking cybercrime ecosystem, and
analysts monitoring malware-related activities should be aware of this so as not to follow
false leads when investigating threat actors.

Technical overview of BlueFox Stealer
Once an emerging malware appears on cybercrime forums, SEKOIA.IO analysts implement
search techniques to retrieve related samples or servers, to produce actionable intelligence
to our customers.

Malware sample association
A few weeks after the launch of BlueFox Stealer v2, we retrieved BlueFox-related malware
samples (SHA256 are available in the IOCs section). Here are the main technical details
allowing SEKOIA to confirm association of these sample to BlueFox stealer with high
confidence:
BlueFox Stealer v2 features, as
described in their publications

SEKOIA.IO’s commentary

Update 2.04 to 2.0.7

We observed samples named BlueFox2.0.4,
BlueFox2.0.5, BlueFox2.0.7 and BlueFox2.0.8.

“Native x86 executable with no
CRT, running .NET in memory”

The .NET sample has no dependencies.

“The size is still about 165 kb.”

The stand-alone malware is 162.5KB.

“Native protocol on TCP/IP in
encrypted form”

The malware communicates over TCP using a
custom protocol, and data is encrypted.

“Collection … from Chromium,
Edge and Firefox-based”

The malware access data from Google Chrome,
Firefox and Microsoft Edge files.

“Self-delete executable after
sending log file.”

Analysed sample deletes itself from the infected host
using the command “cmd.exe /C timeout 5 & del”

“Collect PC data”

The sample reads several Windows Registry keys to
fingerprint the infected host.

“… grabber to search all drives
and flash drives.”

The malware enumerates physical storage devices.

artifacts deemed relevant in our association process.

BlueFox Stealer Malware capabilities
The BlueFox Stealer v2 capabilities advertised by distamx are those of a classic
information stealer, with a focus on cryptocurrency wallets, and file grabber and loader
capabilities.
Here is an overview of its capabilities:
5/9

Targeting of popular browsers (Chromium and Firefox based browsers: Chrome, Edge,
Opera, Mozilla, etc.) to steal passwords, cookies and autocompletes;
Targeting of almost all desktop cryptocurrency wallets and extension for cryptocurrency
wallets (MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Yoroi, Coinbase, Jaxx, Ethereum,
Electrum, Exodus,
etc.);
Targeting password extensions (Bitwarden, 1Password);
File downloading and loading;
File grabbing in all disks;
Screenshot capturing;
System fingerprinting.
BlueFox exfiltrates the collected data to its C2 server using socket communication via native
protocol on TCP/IP in encrypted form. The malware removes itself from the infected host
using the Windows command cmd.exe /C timeout 5 & del "$PATH“.
A dynamic analysis from the Hatching Triage sandbox of a BlueFox Stealer v2 sample is

Conclusion
SEKOIA.IO assess that implementing features for monitoring traffers statistics when
distributing information-stealing malware is likely to become a must-have to be a relevant
player in the cybercrime ecosystem. Based on our observations, such capabilities are
already quite common for prevalent loaders used by Pay-Per-Install services, such as
SmokeLoader, PrivateLoader, and MixLoader.
To provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA.IO analysts will continue to
monitor BlueFox, emerging and prevalent infostealers; and keep an eye on the evolution of
newcomers.
