Reporting regarding activity related to the SolarWinds supply chain injection has grown
quickly since initial disclosure on 13 December 2020. A significant amount of press reporting
has focused on the identification of the actor(s) involved, victim organizations, possible
campaign timeline, and potential impact. The US Government and cyber community have
also provided detailed information on how the campaign was likely conducted and some of
the malware used.
MITRE’s ATT&CK team — with the assistance of contributors — has been mapping
techniques used by the actor group, referred to as UNC2452/Dark Halo by FireEye and
Volexity respectively and more recently attributed to the existing APT29/Cozy Bear/The
Dukes threat group by Mandiant, and members of the US Intelligence Community, as well as
SUNBURST, SUNSPOT, Raindrop, and TEARDROP malware. We have now published a
point release to ATT&CK, v8.2, with the information we’ve mapped and new techniques
we’ve spotted so far.
It’s also been difficult keeping up with all the reporting and updates while trying to track down
descriptions of adversary behavior, particularly as we’re looking for direct analysis of
intrusion data rather than derivative reporting. We were originally listing reports we were
tracking in this blog post itself, but have moved our tracking to a GitHub repository and are
continuing to update that in partnership with MITRE Engenuity’s Center for Threat-Informed
Defense.

A key challenge mapping current reporting is that the actor used a number of behaviors not
currently described by ATT&CK Enterprise or Cloud techniques. We have added new
techniques, sub-techniques, and expansions of scope on existing content to improve this
coverage and wanted to describe what’s new in ATT&CK in v8.2.

UNC2452 Technique Analysis
First and foremost, we would like to thank the individuals and teams responsible for
analyzing, publishing, and/or contributing invaluable information to help the
community react and respond to this incident. This wealth of publicly available
intelligence has described many behaviors performed by the threat actor identified as
UNC2452/Dark Halo/SolarStorm. Mapping these behaviors to ATT&CK, we see a
combination of very commonly used techniques (such as , , and ) as well others that are less
often disclosed in public reporting (ex: ). You can see the techniques we currently have
mapped in the ATT&CK Navigator here, or grab the Navigator layer file from our repository
here.

Techniques used by UNC across multiple reports.
Several behaviors were identified that weren’t previously explicitly captured within existing
techniques. We have now released updates that include:
, such as includingUNC2452 and including them
, such as the description being amended to include in Azure AD
,such as those necessary to describe UNC2452 forging () and () via stolen secret keys
and compromised signing certificates () and making ()

New Group/Software Entries

Along with new/updated techniques we have added several new group and software entries
to ATT&CK including:
, added as with associated group names of Solorigate, StellarParticle and Dark Halo.
, including , , , and .
,.

More to Come?
We don’t expect to add more content to ATT&CK itself before our next major release
(announced as planned for April 2021 in our recent State of the ATT&CK), but anticipate that
more reporting on this intrusion will continue to be released. We will be continuing to watch
and add reporting to our public report tracking, as well as any new techniques or software
that appear to the next release of ATT&CK.
If you see a technique we’re missing from existing reporting, a report with unique information
that we’re missing out on, or want to share a mapping of a new report you’ve done, please
reach out to us at attack@mitre.org.
