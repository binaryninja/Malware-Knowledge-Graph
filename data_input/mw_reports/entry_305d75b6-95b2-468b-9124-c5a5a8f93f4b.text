Threat Group Cards: A Threat Actor Encyclopedia

Introduction
When analyzing security incidents we always face the question which adversary we are possibly dealing
with and what we know about their prior engagements and TTP, to get a better understanding of how to
approach and what else to look for.
This document aims to create full profiles of all threat groups worldwide that have been identified with all
research generously shared by anti-virus and security research organizations over the years. It can be
used as “threat group cards”, as the document title suggests, to have everything together in an elaborate
profile for each threat group. All dates shown in the cards are the dates when the stated activities started,
not necessarily when the reports about them came out.
All information in this document comes from public sources (OSINT). The difficult part of attributing
campaigns to actors has been done by those security research organizations as well. What makes this
difficult is the fact that there may be some overlap between threat groups, where they share tools or
people move between groups, or when groups suddenly change tactics or type of target.
Not all groups have been publicly documented as well as others; most groups have remained rather
obscure and, of course, not all individual campaigns resulted in public knowledge – targeted companies
usually don’t welcome such exposure.
As a National CERT, ThaiCERT has a strictly neutral role and everything collected in this document does
in no way signify specific endorsements, placing blame on countries or taking sides.
With that said, compiling this document has been a tremendously interesting journey into the dark world
of cybercrime and the groups associated with it.
Note: Users of the MISP can also use the MISP Threat Actor cluster (galaxy) located at
<https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy/blob/master/clusters/threat-actor.json>

Approach
In order to obtain an initial set of actors, we perused the public archives from MISP, MITRE and the
volunteer overview on Google Docs (resource 1-3 in the APPENDIX: Sources Used).
Generally, those, as well as media reports about threats, tend to lump everything together as aliases or
synonyms – be it actual group names as tracked by research organizations, alleged (state) sponsor
names, individual campaigns run by the group or specific pieces of malware used by the group. In this
report, aliases are only listed as such if we could realistically determine it to be a fact, generally because
we found which organization gave it that name. Everything else known about each actor has been split off
into the relevant fields (sponsors, operations, tools).
The next step was to search our Risk Intelligence archive and after that, using our favorite Internet search
engine for any public news about each and every actor to find all their campaigns and other activities that
have been discovered. Analysis of those (thousands of) reports created the total overview of all tools
used and where this actor has been observed in terms of countries and sectors.
Lastly, we went over the entire rich archive known as Malpedia to augment the set with malware names
that had not appeared in the reports we saw.
In each step we took great care to make sure only Open Source Intelligence appeared in this document.

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups
Cybereason provides the following definition of an Advanced Persistent Threat:

An advanced persistent threat is a stealthy cyberattack in which a person or group
gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended
period. The term's definition was traditionally associated with nation-state
sponsorship, but over the last few years we’ve seen multiple examples of non-nation
state groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.

Apart from all the APT groups profiled in this chapter, there are of course others, but no public information
is available about them. Especially CrowdStrike has been very active in researching APT groups and
mentioned the following names in passing, in summary reports: Big Panda, Foxy Panda, Hammer Panda,
Impersonating Panda, Judgement Panda, Karma Panda, Keyhole Panda, Kryptonite Panda, Maverick
Panda, Nomad Panda, Poisonous Panda, Predator Panda, Toxic Panda, Union Panda, Wet Panda,
Corsair Jackal and Ghost Jackal.

Country

[Unknown]

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Dragos) Allanite accesses business and industrial control (ICS) networks, conducts
reconnaissance, and gathers intelligence in United States and United Kingdom
electric utility sectors. Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that Allanite
operators continue to maintain ICS network access to: (1) understand the
operational environment necessary to develop disruptive capabilities, (2) have
ready access from which to disrupt electric utilities.
Allanite uses email phishing campaigns and compromised websites called watering
holes to steal credentials and gain access to target networks, including collecting
and distributing screenshots of industrial control systems. Allanite operations limit
themselves to information gathering and have not demonstrated any disruptive or
damaging capabilities.
Allanite conducts malware-less operations primarily leveraging legitimate and
available tools in the Windows operating system.

Operation “Clandestine Fox”
FireEye Research Labs identified a new Internet Explorer (IE) zeroday exploit used in targeted attacks. The vulnerability affects IE6
through IE11, but the attack is targeting IE9 through IE11. This zeroday bypasses both ASLR and DEP. Microsoft has assigned CVE2014-1776 to the vulnerability and released security advisory to track
this issue.

Operation “Clandestine Fox”, Part Deux
While Microsoft quickly released a patch to help close the door on
future compromises, we have now observed the threat actors behind
“Operation Clandestine Fox” shifting their point of attack and using a
new vector to target their victims: social networking.

APT 5
Names

APT 5 (FireEye)

Country

China

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(FireEye) We have observed one APT group, which we call APT5, particularly
focused on telecommunications and technology companies. More than half of the
organizations we have observed being targeted or breached by APT5 operate in
these sectors. Several times, APT5 has targeted organizations and personnel
based in Southeast Asia.
APT5 has been active since at least 2007. It appears to be a large threat group
that consists of several subgroups, often with distinct tactics and infrastructure.
APT5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries, but its
focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies,
especially information about satellite communications.
APT5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both
industrial and military applications. The group subsequently stole communications
related to the firm’s business relationship with a national military, including
inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided.
In one case in late 2014, APT5 breached the network of an international
telecommunications company. The group used malware with keylogging
capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company’s
relationships with other telecommunications companies

Observed

Sectors: Defense, High-Tech, Industrial, Technology and Telecommunications.

APT 6

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) The FBI issued a rare bulletin admitting that a group named
Advanced Persistent Threat 6 (APT6) hacked into US government computer
systems as far back as 2011 and for years stole sensitive data.
The FBI alert was issued in February and went largely unnoticed. Nearly a month
later, security experts are now shining a bright light on the alert and the
mysterious group behind the attack.
“This is a rare alert and a little late, but one that is welcomed by all security
vendors as it offers a chance to mitigate their customers and also collaborate
further in what appears to be an ongoing FBI investigation,” said Deepen Desai,
director of security research at the security firm Zscaler in an email to Threatpost.
Details regarding the actual attack and what government systems were infected
are scant. Government officials said they knew the initial attack occurred in 2011,
but are unaware of who specifically is behind the attacks.
“Given the nature of malware payload involved and the duration of this
compromise being unnoticed – the scope of lateral movement inside the
compromised network is very high possibly exposing all the critical systems,”
Deepen said.

Observed

Sectors: Government.
Countries: USA.

Tools used

Description

(CrowdStrike) Numbered Panda has a long list of high-profile victims and is known
by a number of names including: DYNCALC, IXESHE, JOY RAT, APT-12, etc.
Numbered Panda has targeted a variety of victims including but not limited to media
outlets, high-tech companies, and multiple governments. Numbered Panda has
targeted organizations in time-sensitive operations such as the Fukushima Reactor
Incident of 2011, likely filling intelligence gaps in the ground cleanup/mitigation
operations. Screen saver files, which are binary executables and PDF documents,
are common Numbered Panda weaponization tactics. One of the most interesting
techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the
Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS. This effectively helps
Numbered Panda bypass egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized
communications on some enterprises. The malware will typically use two DNS
names for communication: one is used for command and control; the other is used
with an algorithm to calculate the port to communicate to.

“ETUMBOT” campaign
Target: Taiwan
Once the malicious file was downloaded and extracted by the victim,
Etumbot uses a right-to-left override exploit to trick the victim to
download the malware installer. According to Arbor Security, the
“technique is a simple way for malware writers to disguise names of
malicious files. A hidden Unicode character in the filename will reverse
the order of the characters that follow it, so that a .scr binary file
appears to be a .xls document, for example.”

Breach of The New York Times
“For the last four months, Chinese hackers have persistently attacked
The New York Times, infiltrating its computer systems and getting
passwords for its reporters and other employees.”
The attack occurred after the New York Times published a story about
how the relatives of Wen Jiabao, the sixth Premier of the State
Council of the People’s Republic of China, “accumulated a fortune
worth several billion dollars through business dealings.” The
computers used to launch the attack are believed to be the same

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Palo Alto) We’ve uncovered some new data and likely attribution regarding a
series of APT watering hole attacks this past summer. Watering hole attacks are
an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many people are more
aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in
unsolicited emails. Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success
because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware
intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites
frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies
to which the actors want to gain access.
In contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear
phishing to gain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites
their intended visitors are likely to frequent. Over the summer they compromised
several sites, including a well-known Uyghur website written in that native
language.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(F-Secure) The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized
cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation
since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy
decision-making.
The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such
as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental
subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern
governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian
speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs.
The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we
identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke,
HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have
engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against
hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions
and affiliated organizations.
These campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy
break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as
possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will
quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on
persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering.
In addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and
concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing different
toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The
targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and
security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times.

While the old style Miniduke implants were used to target mostly
government victims, the new style CosmicDuke implants have a

targeting of individuals that appear to be involved in the traffic and
reselling of controlled and illegal substances, such as steroids and
hormones. These victims in the NITRO project have been observed
only in Russia.

In March 2014, a Washington, D.C.-based private research institute
was found to have CozyDuke (Trojan.Cozer) on their network. Cozy
Bear then started an email campaign attempting to lure victims into

malicious executables. By July the group had compromised
government networks and directed CozyDuke-infected systems to

Information theft and espionage

Description

APT 30 is a threat group suspected to be associated with the Chinese
government. While Naikon shares some characteristics with APT 30, the two
groups do not appear to be exact matches.
(FireEye) When our Singapore-based FireEye labs team examined malware
aimed predominantly at entities in Southeast Asia and India, we suspected that
we were peering into a regionally focused cyber espionage operation. The
malware revealed a decade-long operation focused on targets—government and
commercial—who hold key political, economic, and military information about the
region. This group, who we call APT30, stands out not only for their sustained
activity and regional focus, but also for their continued success despite
maintaining relatively consistent tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least
2005.
Based on our knowledge of APT30's targeting activity and tools, their objective
appears to be data theft as opposed to financial gain. APT30 has not been
observed to target victims or data that can be readily monetized (for example,
credit card data, personally identifiable information, or bank transfer credentials).
Instead, their tools include functionality that allows them to identify and steal
documents, including what appears to be an interest in documents that may be
stored on air-gapped networks.
The group expresses a distinct interest in organizations and governments
associated with ASEAN, particularly so around the time of official ASEAN
meetings.
Many of APT30’s decoy documents use topics related to Southeast Asia, India,
border areas, and broader security and diplomatic issues. Decoy documents
attached to spear phishing emails are frequently indicators of intended targeting
because threat actors generally tailor these emails to entice their intended targets
—who typically work on related issues—to click on the attachments and infect
themselves.
In addition to APT30’s Southeast Asia and India focus, we’ve observed APT30
target journalists reporting on issues traditionally considered to be focal points for
the Chinese Communist Party’s sense of legitimacy, such as corruption, the
economy, and human rights. In China, the Communist Party has the ultimate
authority over the government. China-based threat groups have targeted
journalists before; we believe they often do so to get a better understanding on
developing stories to anticipate unfavorable coverage and better position
themselves to shape public messaging.

“2018-PHIẾU GHI DANH THAM DỰ TĨNH HỘI HMDC 2018.doc,”
which translates to “2018-REGISTRATION FORM OF HMDC
ASSEMBLY 2018.doc.” The document claims to be a registration form
for an event with HDMC, an organization in Vietnam that advertises
national independence and democracy.

Watering Hole Attack in Southeast Asia
ESET researchers have discovered a new watering hole campaign
targeting several websites in Southeast Asia, and that is believed to
have been active since September 2018. This campaign stands out
because of its large scale, as we were able to identify 21
compromised websites, some of which are particularly notable.
Among the compromised websites were the Ministry of Defense of
Cambodia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation of Cambodia and several Vietnamese newspaper or blog
websites.

Self-Extracting archives
After using RTF files, the group started using self-extracting (SFX)
archives that use common document icons in an attempt to further
mislead their victims. It was briefly documented by Threatbook (in
Chinese). When run, these self-extracting RAR files drop and execute
DLL files (with a .ocx extension) with the final payload being the
previously documented {A96B020F-0000-466F-A96DA91BBF8EAC96}.dll. Since the middle of January 2019, OceanLotus
began reusing the technique but changed some configuration over
time.

macOS malware update
Early in March 2019, a new macOS malware sample from the
OceanLotus group was uploaded to VirusTotal, a popular online multiscanner service. This backdoor executable bears the same features
as the previous macOS variant we looked at, but its structure has
changed and its detection was made harder. Unfortunately, we
couldn’t find the dropper associated with this sample so we do not
know the initial compromise vector.

Motivation

Information theft, espionage and sabotage

Description

(FireEye) When discussing suspected Middle Eastern hacker groups with
destructive capabilities, many automatically think of the suspected Iranian group
that previously used SHAMOON – aka Disttrack – to target organizations in the
Persian Gulf. However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate,
less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities,
whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has
carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33
works at the behest of the Iranian government.
APT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered
in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular
interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and
commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to
petrochemical production.
APT 33 seems to be closely related to OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Talos) Group 72 is a long standing threat actor group involved in Operation SMN,
named Axiom by Novetta. The group is sophisticated, well funded, and possesses
an established, defined software development methodology. The group targets high
profile organizations with high value intellectual property in the manufacturing,
industrial, aerospace, defense, media sectors. Geographically, the group almost
exclusively targets organizations based in United States, Japan, Taiwan, and
Korea. The preferred tactics of the group include watering-hole attacks, spearphishing, and other web-based tactics.
The tools and infrastructure used by the attackers are common to a number of other
threat actor groups which may indicate some degree of overlap. We have seen
similar patterns used in domain registration for malicious domains, and the same
tactics used in other threat actor groups leading us to believe that this group may
be part of a larger organization that comprises many separate teams, or that
different groups share tactics, code and personnel from time to time.
Though both this group and Winnti Group, Blackfly, Wicked Panda use the malware
Winnti, the two groups appear to be distinct based on differences in reporting on
the groups’ TTPs and targeting.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Bellingcat) Bahamut was first noticed when it targeted a Middle Eastern human
rights activist in the first week of January 2017. Later that month, the same tactics
and patterns were seen in attempts against an Iranian women’s activist – an
individual commonly targeted by Iranian actors, such as Charming Kitten,
Newscaster, NewsBeef and the Sima campaign documented in our 2016 Black Hat
talk. Recurrent patterns in hostnames, registrations, and phishing scripts provided a
strong link between the two incidents, and older attempts were found that directly
overlapped with these attacks. Over the course of the following months, several
more attempts against the same individuals were observed, intended to steal
credentials for iCloud and Gmail accounts.
Bahamut was also observed engaging in reconnaissance and counterreconnaissance attempts, intended to harvest IP addresses of emails accounts.
One attempt impersonated BBC News Alerts, using timely content related to the
diplomatic conflict between Qatar and other Gulf states as bait. This message used
external images embedded in the email to track where the lure would be opened.

Observed

Sectors: Political, economic and social.
Countries: Egypt, Iran, Palestine, Qatar, Tunisia, Turkey and UAE.

Dec 2016

Beginning in December 2016, unconnected Middle Eastern human
rights activists began to receive spear-phishing messages in English
and Persian that were not related to any previously-known groups.
These attempts differed from other tactics seen by us elsewhere, such
as those connected to Iran, with better attention paid to the operation
of the campaign.

For three months there was no apparent further activity from the actor.
However, in the same week of September a series of spear-phishing
attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals,
employing the same tactics as before. Bahamut remains active, and
its operations are more extensive than first disclosed.

Description

(Microsoft) Barium begins its attacks by cultivating relationships with potential
victims—particularly those working in Business Development or Human
Resources—on various social media platforms. Once Barium has established
rapport, they spear-phish the victim using a variety of unsophisticated malware
installation vectors, including malicious shortcut (.lnk) files with hidden payloads,
compiled HTML help (.chm) files, or Microsoft Office documents containing macros
or exploits. Initial intrusion stages feature the Win32/Barlaiy implant—notable for its
use of social network profiles, collaborative document editing sites, and blogs for
C&C. Later stages of the intrusions rely upon Winnti for persistent access. The
majority of victims recorded to date have been in electronic gaming, multimedia,

Description

(Trend Micro) Blackgear is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in
Taiwan for many years. Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this
campaign, which used the ELIRKS backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It
is known for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its
actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an attacker to change the
C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.
Like most campaigns, Blackgear has evolved over time. Our research indicates that
it has started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion: first,
the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are now in
Japanese. Secondly, it is now using blogging sites and microblogging services
based in Japan for its C&C activity.

2010

Operation “Shrouded Crossbow”
This campaign, first observed in 2010, is believed to be operated by a
well-funded group given how it appeared to have purchased the
source code of the BIFROST backdoor, which the operators enhanced
and created other tools from. Shrouded Crossbow targeted privatized
agencies and government contractors as well as enterprises in the
consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financial industries.

Operation “PLEAD”
PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for
confidential documents. Active since 2012, it has so far targeted
Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations.

2014

Operation “Waterbear”
Waterbear has actually been operating for a long time. The
campaign’s name is based on its malware’s capability to equip
additional functions remotely.

Jul 2018

ESET researchers have discovered a new malware campaign
misusing stolen digital certificates.
We spotted this malware campaign when our systems marked several
files as suspicious. Interestingly, the flagged files were digitally signed
using a valid D-Link Corporation code-signing certificate. The exact
same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link software;
therefore, the certificate was likely stolen.

up to now is from November 2013.
This is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the
attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite
is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan.
One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted
industries includes government and government agencies, local governments,
public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy,
communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media,
information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics,
construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still

also targeting organizations in Thailand based on the contents of the associated
decoys documents, as well as several of the dynamic DNS domain names used to
host C2 servers that contain the words “Thai” or “Thailand”. Analysis of
compromised systems seen communicating with Bookworm C2 servers also

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(SecureWorks) CTU analysis indicates that Bronze Bulter primarily targets
organizations located in Japan. The threat group has sought unauthorized access
to networks of organizations associated with critical infrastructure, heavy industry,
manufacturing, and international relations. Secureworks analysts have observed
Bronze Bulter exfiltrating the following categories of data:






Intellectual property related to technology and development
Product specification
Sensitive business and sales-related information
Network and system configuration files
Email messages and meeting minutes

The focus on intellectual property, product details, and corporate information
suggests that the group seeks information that they believe might be of value to
competing organizations. The diverse targeting suggests that Bronze Bulter may be
tasked by multiple teams or organizations with varying priorities.

Buhtrap (Group-IB)

Country

Russia

Motivation

Financial gain

Description

(Group-IB) Buhtrap has been active since 2014, however their first attacks against
financial institutions were only detected in August 2015. Earlier, the group had only
focused on targeting banking clients. At the moment, the group is known to target
Russian and Ukrainian banks.
From August 2015 to February 2016 Buhtrap managed to conduct 13 successful
attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 mln).
The number of successful attacks against Ukrainian banks has not been identified.
Buhtrap is the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank
infrastructure that significantly increases the difficulty of removing all malicious
functions from the network. As a result, banks have to shut down the whole
infrastructure which provokes delay in servicing customers and additional losses.
Malicious programs intentionally scan for machines with an automated BankCustomer system of the Central Bank of Russia (further referred to as BCS CBR).
We have not identified incidents of attacks involving online money transfer systems,
ATM machines or payment gates which are known to be of interest for other
criminal groups.

2014

On October 20, 2014 we notified Group-IB Bot-Trek Intelligence
subscribers about phishing emails which were sent from the
info@beeline-mail.ru address with the subject “Invoice No 522375ФЛОРЛ-14-115” (pic. 1). The beeline-mail.ru domain name was also
registered on October 20, 2014.

We noticed in late October that users visiting the Ammyy website to
download the free version of its remote administrator software were
being served a bundle containing not only the legitimate Remote

Scriptable Installation Software) installer ultimately intended to install
the tools used by the Buhtrap gang to spy on and control their victims’
computers.

Dec 2015

In December 2015, employees from several Russian banks were
targeted with spoofed emails, a common technique in attack
campaigns. The emails were made to look like they were from the
Central Bank of Russia and offered employment to their recipients.
Instead of being an actual employment offer, the emails were an
attempt to deliver Trojan.Ratopak onto the target’s computer.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) Symantec telemetry identified Cadelle and
Chafer, APT 39 activity dating from as far back as July 2014, however, it’s likely
that activity began well before this date. Command-and-control (C&C) registrant
information points to activity possibly as early as 2011, while executable
compilation times suggest early 2012. Their attacks continue to the present day.
Symantec estimates that each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people.
There is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way,
though we cannot confirm this. A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy
and Remexi infections within a small time window. In one instance, a computer was
compromised with Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with
Backdoor.Remexi. The Cadelle and Chafer groups also keep the same working
hours and focus on similar targets. However, no sharing of C&C infrastructure
between the teams has been observed.
If Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working
for a single entity. Their victim profile may be of interest to a nation state.

Callisto Group
Names

Callisto Group (F-Secure)

Country

[Unknown]

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(F-Secure) The most obvious common theme between all known targets of the
Callisto Group is an involvement in European foreign and security policy, whether
as a military or government official, being employed by a think tank, or working as a
journalist . More specifically, many of the known targets have a clear relation to
foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.
This targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering
related to foreign and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting
in the described attacks that would suggest a financial motive
It is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between
infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host
online stores selling controlled substances. While we don’t yet know enough to fully
understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the existence of connections
between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.
While the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group’s
activity is a nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South
Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled
substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element. Finally, the infrastructure
associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure contain links to at least
Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure, and in
WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.
It is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above
findings. For example, a cybercrime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting
on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation.
However, we do not believe it is possible to make any definitive assertions
regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the currently
available information.

Motivation

Financial gain

Description

Carbanak is a threat group that mainly targets banks. It also refers to malware of
the same name (Carbanak). It is sometimes referred to as FIN7, but these appear
to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked
separately.
(Kaspersky) From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have
been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar
modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies
(LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1
billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of
these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques
commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial
gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the
initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be
legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 (.doc) and
Control Panel Applet (.CPL) files attached. We believe that the attackers also
redirected to exploit kits website traffic that related to financial activity.

Description

(Kaspersky) The Mask is an advanced threat actor that has been involved in cyberespionage operations since at least 2007. The name "Mask" comes from the
Spanish slang word "Careto" ("Ugly Face" or “Mask”) which the authors included in
some of the malware modules.
More than 380 unique victims in 31 countries have been observed to date. What
makes “The Mask” special is the complexity of the toolset used by the attackers.
This includes an extremely sophisticated malware, a rootkit, a bootkit, 32-and 64-bit
Windows versions, Mac OS X and Linux versions and possibly versions for Android
and iPad/iPhone (Apple iOS).

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(FireEye) APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods
used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as
"Chafer." However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to
the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the
SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the
POWBAT backdoor. While APT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are
concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications
sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and
the high-tech industry.
APT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to
perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals,
collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that
serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional
accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting
suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit
nation-state decision making. Targeting data supports the belief that APT39's key
mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information,
including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications
firms.

Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.
Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT
services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors;
telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and
document management software.
Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of
attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an
international travel reservations firm.

Description

(CrowdStrike) Clever Kitten primarily targets global companies with strategic
importance to countries that are contrary to Iranian interests.
Clever Kitten actors have a strong affinity for PHP server-side attacks to make
access; this is relatively unique amongst targeted attackers who often favor
targeting a specific individual at a specific organization using social engineering.
Some attackers have moved to leveraging strategic web compromises. The reason
for this is likely the availability of exploits against web browsers, which for a variety
of reasons allows an attacker to bypass security features such as Data Execution
Prevention (DEP) or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

One of the latest examples related to the campaign under analysis
was used in attacks just a few days ago. It shows the simplicity of the
attack delivery employed by this group.
The attack reinforces the fact that email is still one of the primary

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Lastline) While reviewing some network anomalies, we recently uncovered Cold
River, a sophisticated threat actor making malicious use of DNS tunneling for
command and control activities. We have been able to decode the raw traffic in
command and control, find sophisticated lure documents used in the campaign,
connect other previously unknown samples, and associate a number of legitimate
organizations whose infrastructure is referenced and used in the campaign.
The campaign targets Middle Eastern organizations largely from the Lebanon and
United Arab Emirates, though, Indian and Canadian companies with interests in
those Middle Eastern countries are also targeted. There are new TTPs used in this
attack – for example Agent_Drable is leveraging the Django python framework for
command and control infrastructure, the technical details of which are outlined later
in the blog.

Observed

Countries: Canada, India and Middle East (mostly Lebanon and UAE).

Description

Also known as APT1, Comment Crew is an advanced persistent threat (APT)
group with links to the Chinese military. The threat actors, which were active from
roughly 2006 to 2010, managed to strike over 140 US companies in the quest for
sensitive corporate and intellectual property data.
The group earned their name through their use of HTML comments to hide
communication to the command-and-control servers. The usual attack vector was
via spear-phishing campaigns utilizing emails which contained documents with
names tailored for the potential victims, such as
“ArmyPlansConferenceOnNewGCVSolicitation.pdf,” or “Chinese Oil Executive

Target: Oceansalt appears to have been part of an operation
targeting South Korea, United States, and Canada in a wellfocused attack. A variation of this malware has been distributed
from two compromised sites in South Korea.
Method: Oceansalt appears to be the first stage of an advanced
persistent threat. The malware can send system data to a control
server and execute commands on infected machines, but we do
not yet know its ultimate purpose.
Note: It is possible that this operation was not performed by the
actual Comment Crew group (as they are supposedly in jail).

Confucius

Confucius (Palo Alto)

Country

[South Asia]

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Trend Micro) Confucius’ campaigns were reportedly active as early as 2013,
abusing Yahoo! And Quora forums as part of their command-and-control (C&C)
communications. We stumbled upon Confucius, likely from South Asia, while
delving into Patchwork’s cyberespionage operations.
Confucius’ operations include deploying bespoke backdoors and stealing files from
their victim’s systems with tailored file stealers. The stolen files are then exfiltrated
by abusing a cloud service provider. Some of these file stealers specifically target
files from USB devices, probably to overcome air-gapped environments.
This group seems to be associated with Patchwork, Dropping Elephant.

Observed

Countries: Most of the South and Southeast Asian countries (including Mongolia),
most of the Middle Eastern countries, with a focus on Pakistan, most of the African
countries, Trinidad, Tobago and Ukraine.

Tools used

ApacheStealer, ByeBye Shell, Confucius, MY24, sctrls, remote-access-c3 and
sip_telephone, swissknife2 and Sneepy.

Operations
performed

Oct 2017

In recent weeks, Unit 42 has discovered three documents crafted to
exploit the InPage program. InPage is a word processor program that
supports languages such as Urdu, Persian, Pashto, and Arabic. The
three InPage exploit files are linked through their use of very similar
shellcode, which suggests that either the same actor is behind these
attacks, or the attackers have access to a shared builder.

Probing Confucius’ infrastructure, we came across websites offering
Windows and Android chat applications, most likely iterations of its
predecessor, Simple Chat Point: Secret Chat Point, and Tweety Chat.
We are admittedly uncertain of the extent — and success — of their
use, but it’s one of the ingredients of the group’s operations.

Motivation

Financial gain

Description

(Group-IB) In February 2015 the first major successful attack on a Russian trading
system took place, when hackers gained unsanctioned access to trading system
terminals using a Trojan resulting in trades of more than $400million.
The criminals made purchases and sales of US dollars in the Dollar/Ruble
exchange program on behalf of a bank using malware. The attack itself lasted only
14 minutes, however, it managed to cause a high volatility in the exchange rate of
between 55/62 (Buy/Sell) rubles per 1 dollar instead of the 60-62 stable range.
To conduct the attack criminals used the Corkow malware, also known as Metel,
containing specific modules designed to conduct thefts from trading systems, such
as QUIK operated by ARQA Technologies and TRANSAQ from ZAO “Screen
market systems”. Corkow provided remote access to the ITS-Broker system
terminal by «Platforma soft» Ltd., which enabled the fraud to be committed.
In August 2015 a new incident related to the Corkow (Metel) Trojan was detected.
An attack on a bank card systems, which included about 250 banks which used the
bank card system to service cash withdrawals from Visa and MasterCard cards
under a special tariff. This attack resulted in the hundreds of millions of rubles being
stolen via ATMs of the systems members.

Country

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Dragos) Covellite compromises networks associated with civilian electric energy
worldwide and gathers intelligence on intellectual property and internal industrial
operations. Covellite lacks an industrial control system (ICS) specific capability at
this time.
Covellite operates globally with targets primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North
America. US targets emerged in September 2017 with a small, targeted phishing
campaign directed at select U.S. electric companies. The phishing emails contained
a malicious Microsoft Word document and infected computers with malware.
The malicious emails discovered in the fall masqueraded as resumes or invitations.
They delivered a remote access tool (RAT) payload which was used to conduct
reconnaissance and enable persistent, covert access to victims’ machines.
Covellite’s infrastructure and malware are similar to the hacking organization known
as Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima by Novetta and Hidden Cobra
by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Lazarus Group is responsible for attacks ranging from the 2014 attack on Sony
Pictures to a number of Bitcoin heists in 2017. Technical analysis of Covellite
malware indicates an evolution from known Lazarus toolkits. However, aside from
technical overlap, it is not known how the capabilities and operations between
Covellite and Lazarus are related.
Covellite remains active but appears to have abandoned North American targets,
with indications of activity in Europe and East Asia. Given the group’s specific
interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of
aggressive targeting, Dragos considers this group a primary threat to the ICS
industry.

Description

(SecurityWeek) The activities of the DarkHotel advanced persistent threat (APT)
actor came to light in November 2014, when Kaspersky published a report
detailing a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign targeting business travelers
in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has been around for nearly a decade and
some researchers believe its members are Korean speakers.
The attackers targeted their victims using several methods, including through
their hotel’s Wi-Fi, zero-day exploits and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing websites.
Nearly one year later, the threat group was observed using new attack
techniques and an exploit leaked from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team.
DarkHotel victims have been spotted in several countries, including North Korea,
Russia, South Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United
States, India, Mozambique, Indonesia and Germany. Up until recently, the
attacks appeared to focus on company executives, researchers and development
personnel from sectors such as defense industrial base, military, energy,
government, NGOs, electronics manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and medical.
In more recent DarkHotel attacks it has dubbed “Inexsmar,” security firm
Bitdefender said the hackers targeted political figures, and they appeared to be
using some new methods.

Method: spear-phishing targets with highly advanced Flash zeroday exploits that effectively evade the latest Windows and Adobe
defenses, and yet they also imprecisely spread among large
numbers of vague targets with peer-to-peer spreading tactics.
Moreover, this crew’s most unusual characteristic is that for

Description

(Kaspersky) The Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab
has uncovered new targeted attacks in the Middle East. Native Arabic-speaking
cybercriminals have built advanced methods and tools to deliver, hide and operate
malware that they have also developed themselves. This malware was originally
discovered during an investigation of one of the attacks in the Middle East.
Political activities and news are being actively used by the cybercriminals to entice
victims into opening files and attachments. Content has been created with
professionalism, with well-designed visuals and interesting, familiar details for the
victims, as if the information were long awaited.
The victims of the attacks to date have been carefully chosen; they are active and
influential in their respective cultures, but also attractive to the cybercriminals as a
source of intelligence and a target for extortion.
The attackers have been operating for more than two years now, running different
campaigns, targeting different types of victims and different types of devices
(including Windows- and Android-based). We suspect that at least 30 people
distributed across different countries are operating the campaigns

Based on this actor's infrastructure and TTPs, we haven't been able to connect
them with any other campaign or actor that's been observed recently. This
particular campaign utilizes two fake, malicious websites containing job postings
that are used to compromise targets via malicious Microsoft Office documents with

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Check Point) Recent investigations by Check Point researchers reveal an
extensive and targeted attack that has been taking place since 2016 and, until now,
has remained under the radar due to the artful deception of its attackers towards
their targets. Through the use of mobile applications, those behind the attack use
fake decoy content to entice their victims to download such applications, which are
in fact loaded with spyware, to then collect sensitive information about them.
Interestingly, these targets include Kurdish and Turkish natives and ISIS
supporters. Most interesting of all, though, is that all these targets are actually
Iranians citizens.
Considering the nature of the target, the data collected about these groups provides
those behind the campaign with highly valuable information that will no doubt be
leveraged in further future action against them. Indeed, the malware collects data
including contact lists stored on the victim’s mobile device, phone call records, SMS
messages, browser history and bookmarks, geo-location of the victim, photos,
surrounding voice recordings and more.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(ASERT) In late January 2018, ASERT discovered a new modular malware
framework we call "yty". The framework shares a striking resemblance to the
EHDevel framework. We believe with medium confidence that a team we call
internally as "Donot Team" is responsible for the new malware and will resume
targeting of South Asia.
In a likely effort to disguise the malware and its operations, the authors coded
several references into the malware for football—it is unclear whether they mean
American football or soccer. The theme may allow the network traffic to fly under
the radar.
The actors use false personas to register their domains instead of opting for privacy
protection services. Depending on the registrar service chosen, this could be seen
as another cost control measure. The actors often used typo-squatting to slightly
alter a legitimate domain name. In contrast, the registration information used
accurate spelling, possibly indicating the domain naming was intentional, typos
included. Each unique registrant usually registered only a few domains, but
mistakenly reused phone numbers or the registration data portrayed a similar
pattern across domains.

Jan 2015

This campaign involved five separate phishing attacks, each carrying
a different variant of Sysget malware, also known as HelloBridge. The
malware was included as an attachment intended to trick the user into
opening the malware.
All five phishing campaigns targeted a Japanese manufacturing firm
over the course of two months, but the final campaign also targeted a
separate Japanese high-tech organization.

In recent months, Unit 42 has observed a number of attacks that we
attribute to this group. Multiple new variants of the previously
discussed sysget malware family have been observed in use by
DragonOK. Sysget malware was delivered both directly via phishing
emails, as well as in Rich Text Format (RTF) documents exploiting the
CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability that in turn leveraged a very unique
shellcode.

Cybersecurity expert Niklas Femerstrand in an email yesterday
pointed out that while servers in several different countries appear to
be the origin the attack, it has been linked to the DragonOK campaign.
“The DragonOK campaign has previously [in 2014] targeted
organizations in Taiwan, Japan, Tibet and Russia, and political
organizations in Cambodia since at least January, 2017,” he wrote,
adding that there are “strong indications” the campaign is “an

(Kaspersky) For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language
cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities.
We named the actor DustSquad and have provided private intelligence reports to
our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom Android and Windows
malware. In this blogpost we cover a malicious program for Windows called
Octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities.
The name was originally coined by ESET in 2017 after the 0ct0pus3.php script
used by the actor on their old C2 servers. We also started monitoring the malware
and, using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms, discovered
that Octopus is related to DustSquad, something we reported in April 2018. In our
telemetry we tracked this campaign back to 2014 in the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia (still mostly Russian-speaking), plus Afghanistan.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Cylance) Very little public information was available throughout 2010 on this threat,
despite the group’s primary backdoor gaining some level of prominence in targeted
Asian attacks. This may be explained by the group’s early reliance on Dynamic
DNS domains for their command and control (C2) infrastructure, as well as their
use of public RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT for second-stage implants.
It wasn’t until June 2011 that Operation Dust Storm started to garner some notoriety
from a series of attacks which leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8
vulnerability, CVE-2011-1255, to gain a foothold into victim networks. In these
attacks, a link to the exploit was sent via a spear phishing email from a purported
Chinese student seeking advice or asking the target a question following a
presentation.
As to other documented cases, the attacker started interacting with the infected
machine within minutes of compromise to begin manual network and host
enumeration.
In October 2011, the group attempted to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan
crisis at the time and phish the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi’s death on
October 20, 2011. It appears that in addition to some US defense targets, this
campaign was also directed at a Uyghur mailing list. This time, the group used a
specially crafted malicious Windows Help (.hlp) file, which exploited CVE-20101885.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) In 2009, Google was attacked by a group using the Hydraq (Aurora)
Trojan horse. Symantec has monitored this group’s activities for the last three years
as they have consistently targeted a number of industries. Interesting highlights in
their method of operations include: the use of seemingly an unlimited number of
zero-day exploits, attacks on supply chain manufacturers who service the target
organization, and a shift to “watering hole” attacks (compromising certain websites
likely to be visited by the target organization). The targeted industry sectors include,
but are not restricted to; defense, various defense supply chain manufacturers,
human rights and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and IT service
providers. These attackers are systematic and re-use components of an
infrastructure we have termed the “Elderwood platform”. The name “Elderwood”
comes from a source code variable used by the attackers. This attack platform
enables them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. Attacks are deployed through
spear phishing emails and also, increasingly, through Web injections in watering
hole attacks.
It is likely the attackers have gained access to the source code for some widely
used applications, or have thoroughly reverse-engineered the compiled applications
in order to discover these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are used as needed,
often within close succession of each other if exposure of any of the vulnerabilities
is imminent. The scale of the attacks, in terms of the number of victims and the
duration of the attacks, are another indication of the resources available to the
attackers. Victims are attacked, not for petty crime or theft, but for the wholesale
gathering of intelligence and intellectual property. The resources required to identify
and acquire useful information—let alone analyze that information—could only be
provided by a large criminal organization, attackers supported by a nation state, or
a nation state itself.

According to Kaspersky, Crouching Yeti has been operating since at least 2010 and
has infected roughly 2,800 targets in 38 countries, and in industries as diverse as
education and pharmaceuticals.
A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as Berserk Bear,
Dragonfly 2.0. There is debate over the extent of the overlap between Dragonfly
and Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0, but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these
being tracked as two separate groups.

Watering Hole Attacks using Lightsout
In June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole
attacks. They compromised a number of energy-related websites and
injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected
visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the
Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet
Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer.

In September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this
exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing page for this kit
contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed
browser plugins. The victim is then redirected to a URL which in turn
determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected.

energy sector with Remote Access Tools and Intelligence gathering
malware. It would seem that the attackers responsible for this threat
are back for more. This particular APT struck late February between
2/24-2/26.

Attack on Energy Companies in the Ukraine
According to a statement posted this week on the official website of
the Ukrainian security service SBU, Russian special services allegedly
planted malware on the networks of several regional power
companies. The malicious software is said to have been discovered
by employees of the SBU.
The SBU said the attackers also flooded the targeted companies’
technical support phone lines. The agency removed the malware and
launched an investigation.
Just before Christmas, power outages were reported in the IvanoFrankivsk Oblast region of Ukraine. The outages were blamed on
outsiders who remotely tampered with automatic control systems. The
power company responsible for the region also reported that its call
center suffered a technical failure caused by a barrage of calls.

Sponsor

State-sponsored, believed to be tied to the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations unit.

Motivation

Sabotage and destruction

Description

(Ars Technica) Kaspersky researchers have documented 500 infections by
Equation Group in at least 42 countries, with Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
India, Syria, and Mali topping the list. Because of a self-destruct mechanism built
into the malware, the researchers suspect that this is just a tiny percentage of the
total; the actual number of victims likely reaches into the tens of thousands.
A long list of almost superhuman technical feats illustrate Equation Group's
extraordinary skill, painstaking work, and unlimited resources. They include:










The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated
Regin malware. Recently published documents provided by Ed Snowden
indicate that the NSA used Regin to infect the partly state-owned Belgian firm
Belgacom.
The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computer's
registry. By encrypting all malicious files and storing them in multiple branches
of a computer's Windows registry, the infection was impossible to detect using
antivirus software.
Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages. In addition,
infected machines reporting to Equation Group command servers identified
themselves as Macs, an indication that the group successfully compromised
both iOS and OS X devices.
The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling
command and control infrastructure.
USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks, which
are so sensitive that they aren't connected to the Internet. Both Stuxnet and the
related Flame malware platform also had the ability to bridge airgaps.
An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in
modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software
interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized
certificate authority. To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware
exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to
achieve kernel-level code execution.

Taken together, the accomplishments led Kaspersky researchers to conclude that
Equation Group is probably the most sophisticated computer attack group in the
world, with technical skill and resources that rival the groups that developed
Stuxnet and the Flame espionage malware.
Their arsenal of 0-day cyber weapons was stolen by an actor Shadow Brokers, who
leaked a large section on the internet4 and tried to sell the rest afterward.
Most notable among the dumps were 0-days such as ETERNALBLUE and
ETERNALROMANCE that were used by other groups for the creation of infamous
ransomware explosions such as WannaCry and NotPetya.

Description

(FireEye) FireEye tracks a threat group that we call "FIN4," whose intrusions seem
to have a different objective: to obtain an edge in stock trading. FIN4 appears to
conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to
insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public
companies. The group specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal
counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who
would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.
FIN4 has targeted over 100 companies since at least mid-2013. All of the targeted
organizations are either public companies or advisory firms that provide services to
public companies (such as investor relations, legal, and investment banking firms).
Over two-thirds of the targeted organizations are healthcare and pharmaceutical
companies. FIN4 probably focuses on these types of organizations because their
stocks can move dramatically in response to news of clinical trial results, regulatory
decisions, or safety and legal issues.

Motivation

Description

FIN5 is a financially motivated threat group that has targeted personally identifiable
information and payment card information. The group has been active since at least
2008 and has targeted the restaurant, gaming, and hotel industries. The group is
made up of actors who likely speak Russian.
(DarkReading) No 0days. No spear-phishing, either: The cybercriminal group tied to
numerous payment card breaches including Goodwill and best known by its socalled "RawPOS" malware employed legitimate user credentials to access its
targets' networks.
Researchers at FireEye here today shared their recent findings on this prolific and
long-running cybercrime gang that has been the subject of multiple Visa security
alerts to merchants. The RawPOS memory scraper malware has been infecting the
lodging industry in epidemic proportions over the past year, and is considered one
of the first memory scrapers to target point-of-sale systems.
FireEye has dubbed the cybercrime gang FIN5. "One of the most unique things
about FIN5 is that in every intrusion we responded to where FIN5 has been active,
legitimate access was identified. They had valid user credentials to remotely log
into the network," said Barry Vengerik, principal threat analyst at FireEye. "No sexy
zero-days, no remote exploits -- not even spear-phishing. They had credentials
from somewhere."
FIN5, which earlier this year was profiled by researchers at Trend Micro and has
been in action since at least 2008, uses real credentials from the victim
organization's virtual private network, Remote Desktop Protocol, Citrix, or VNC.
Vengerik says the attackers got those credentials via third parties associated with
the victims' POS systems.

Description

(FireEye) We attribute the use of this EoP to a financially motivated threat actor. In
the past year, not only have we observed this group using similar infrastructure and
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but they are also the only group we
have observed to date who uses the downloader PUNCHBUGGY and POS
malware PUNCHTRACK. Designed to scrape both Track 1 and Track 2 payment
card data, PUNCHTRACK is loaded and executed by a highly obfuscated launcher
and is never saved to disk.
This actor has conducted operations on a large scale and at a rapid pace,
displaying a level of operational awareness and ability to adapt their operations on
the fly. These abilities, combined with targeted usage of an EoP exploit and the
reconnaissance required to individually tailor phishing emails to victims, potentially
speaks to the threat actors’ operational maturity and sophistication.

“Author” fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously
developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses
unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially
started due to Ukraine’s decision to accept the Ukraine--‐European Union
Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic
integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly
stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia’s national
security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the
campaign didn’t start until much later (mid‐2013), as Ukraine and the EU started to
more actively move towards the agreement.
Russian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The
earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June
26, 2013. A group of files with modification timestamps between August 12 and
September 16, 2013 were used in the first wave of spear-phishing attacks, targeting
government officials prior to the 10th Yalta Annual Meeting: “Changing Ukraine in a
Changing World: Factors of Success.”

Description

(Kaspersky) A second group, which we call GCMAN because the malware is based
on code compiled on the GCC compiler, emerged recently using similar techniques
to the Corkow, Metel Group to infect banking institutions and attempt to transfer
money to e-currency services.
The initial infection mechanism is handled by spear-phishing financial institution
targets with e-mails carrying a malicious RAR archive to. Upon opening the RAR
archive, an executable is started instead of a Microsoft Word document, resulting in
infection.
Once inside the network, the GCMAN group uses legitimate and penetration testing
tools such as Putty, VNC, and Meterpreter for lateral movement. Our investigation
revealed an attack where the group then planted a cron script into bank’s server,
sending financial transactions at the rate of $200 per minute. A time-based
scheduler was invoking the script every minute to post new transactions directly to
upstream payment processing system. This allowed the group to transfer money to
multiple e-currency services without these transactions being reported to any
system inside the bank.

Description

(Information Warfare Monitor) Cyber espionage is an issue whose time has come.
In this second report from the Information Warfare Monitor, we lay out the findings
of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against Tibetan
institutions. The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and
laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more. The investigation ultimately uncovered a
network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. Up to 30% of the infected
hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located at ministries
of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs.
The Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our
investigations began, were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that
gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information.
(UCAM) Attacks on the Dalai Lama’s Private Office
The OHHDL started to suspect it was under surveillance while setting up meetings
be-tween His Holiness and foreign dignitaries. They sent an email invitation on
behalf of His Holiness to a foreign diplomat, but before they could follow it up with a
courtesy telephone call, the diplomat’s office was contacted by the Chinese
government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting. The Tibetans wondered
whether a computer compromise might be the explanation; they called ONI Asia
who called us. (Until May 2008, the first author was employed on a studentship
funded by the OpenNet Initiative and the second author was a principal investigator
for ONI.)

terrorist attacks to lure the victim into decompressing. When the archive gets
decompressed on the vulnerable computer, the embedded njRAT backdoor
(Telegram Desktop.exe) will be extracted to the startup folder and then triggered
into execution if the victim restarts the computer or performs re-login. After that,
the attacker is capable to control the compromised device.

Description

(IBM) IBM X-Force Research uncovered a Trojan hybrid spawned from the Nymaim
and Gozi ISFB malware. It appears that the operators of Nymaim have recompiled
its source code with part of the Gozi ISFB source code, creating a combination that
is being actively used in attacks against more than 24 U.S. and Canadian banks,
stealing millions of dollars so far. X-Force named this new hybrid GozNym.
The new GozNym hybrid takes the best of both the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB
malware to create a powerful Trojan. From the Nymaim malware, it leverages the
dropper’s stealth and persistence; the Gozi ISFB parts add the banking Trojan’s
capabilities to facilitate fraud via infected Internet browsers. The end result is a new

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) The Hidden Lynx group has been in operation since at least 2009 and
is most likely a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” service.
They have the capability to attack many organizations with concurrently running
campaigns. They operate efficiently and move quickly and methodically. Based on
these factors, the Hidden Lynx group would need to be a sizeable organization
made up of between 50 and 100 individuals.
Much of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate
from network infrastructure in China. The Hidden Lynx group makes regular use of
zero-day exploits and has the ability to rework and customize exploits quickly. They
are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some
other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also
known as APT1). The Hidden Lynx group is an advanced persistent threat that has
been in operation for at least four years and is breaking into some of the bestprotected organizations in the world. With a zero-day attack already under their belt
in 2013, they continue to operate at the leading edge of targeted attacks.
This group appears to be closely associated with APT 17, Deputy Dog.

impressive: they are like a dog with a bone.
Hurricane Panda’s preferred initial vector of compromise and persistence is a China
Chopper webshell – a tiny and easily obfuscated 70 byte text file that consists of an
‘eval()’ command, which is then used to provide full command execution and file
upload/download capabilities to the attackers. This script is typically uploaded to a
web server via a SQL injection or WebDAV vulnerability, which is often trivial to
uncover in a company with a large external web presence.
Once inside, the adversary immediately moves on to execution of a credential theft
tool such as Mimikatz (repacked to avoid AV detection). If they are lucky to have
caught an administrator who might be logged into that web server at the time, they
will have gained domain administrator credentials and can now roam your network
at will via ‘net use’ and ‘wmic’ commands executed through the webshell terminal.

about a thief who entered peoples’ dreams and stole secrets from their
subconscious. Targets include individuals in strategic positions: Executives in
important businesses such as oil, finance and engineering, military officers,
embassy personnel and government officials. The Inception attacks began by
focusing on targets primarily located in Russia or related to Russian interests, but
have since spread to targets in other locations around the world. The preferred

Information theft and espionage

Description

Since early 2013, we have observed activity from a unique threat actor group,
which we began to investigate based on increased activities against human right
activists in the beginning of 2015. In line5with other research on the campaign,
released prior to publication of this document, we have adopted the name “Infy”,
which is based on labels used in the infrastructure and its two families of malware
agents.
Thanks to information we have been able to collect during the course of our
research, such as characteristics of the group’s malware and development cycle,
our research strongly supports the claim that the Infy group is of Iranian origin
and potentially connected to the Iranian state. Amongst a backdrop of other
incidents, Infy became one of the most frequently observed agents for attempted
malware attacks against Iranian civil society beginning in late 2014, growing in
use up to the February 2016 parliamentary election in Iran. After the conclusion of
the parliamentary election, the rate of attempted intrusions and new compromises
through the Infy agent slowed, but did not end. The trends witnessed in reports
from recipients are reinforced through telemetry provided by design failures in
more recent versions of the Infy malware.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) Iridium is an APT that uses proprietary techniques to bypass two-factor
authentication for critical applications, according to security firm Resecurity.
A researcher has attributed a recently publicized attack on Citrix’ internal network to
the Iranian-linked group known as Iridium – and said that the data heist involved 6
terabytes of sensitive data.
The culprit is an APT that uses proprietary techniques to bypass two-factor
authentication for critical applications and services for further unauthorized access
to virtual private networks and single sign-on systems, according to Resecurity.
“[Iridium] has hit more than 200 government agencies, oil and gas companies and
technology companies, including Citrix Systems Inc.,” they said. Threatpost has
reached out for further details as to how the firm is linking the APT to the attack and
will update this post accordingly.

Operation “Ke3chang”
As the crisis in Syria escalates, FireEye research-ers have discovered
a cyber espionage campaign, which we call “Ke3chang,” that falsely
advertises information updates about the ongoing crisis to
compromise MFA networks in Europe. We believe that the Ke3chang
attackers are operating out of China and have been active since at
least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against
MFAs (codenamed by Ke3chang as “moviestar”) began only in August
2013. The timing of the attacks precedes a G20 meeting held in
Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria.

May 2016

Little has been published on the threat actors responsible for
Operation Ke3chang since the report was released more than two
years ago. However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have
continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We’ve discovered
a new malware family we’ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral
ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign
against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also
consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted
the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns
against India.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) For several months, we have been monitoring an ongoing cyberespionage campaign against South Korean think-tanks. There are multiple reasons
why this campaign is extraordinary in its execution and logistics. It all started one
day when we encountered a somewhat unsophisticated spy program that
communicated with its “master” via a public e-mail server. This approach is rather
inherent to many amateur virus-writers and these malware attacks are mostly
ignored.

Motivation

Information theft, espionage, disruption, sabotage and financial gain

Description

(Malwarebytes) Lazarus Group is commonly believed to be run by the North Korean
government, motivated primarily by financial gain as a method of circumventing
long-standing sanctions against the regime. They first came to substantial media
notice in 2013 with a series of coordinated attacks against an assortment of South
Korean broadcasters and financial institutions using DarkSeoul, a wiper program
that overwrites sections of the victims’ master boot record.
In November 2014, a large scale breach of Sony Pictures was attributed to
Lazarus. The attack was notable due to its substantial penetration across Sony
networks, the extensive amount of data exfiltrated and leaked, as well of use of a
wiper in a possible attempt to erase forensic evidence. Attribution on the attacks
was largely hazy, but the FBI released a statement tying the Sony breach to the
earlier DarkSeoul attack, and officially attributed both incidents to North Korea.
Fast forward to May 2017 with the widespread outbreak of WannaCry, a piece of
ransomware that used an SMB exploit as an attack vector. Attribution to North
Korea rested largely on code reuse between WannaCry and previous North Korean
attacks, but this was considered to be thin grounds given the common practice of
tool sharing between regional threat groups. Western intelligence agencies
released official statements to the public reaffirming the attribution, and on
September 6, 2018, the US Department of Justice charged a North Korean national
with involvement in both WannaCry and the Sony breach.

The attacks, which left many South Koreans unable to withdraw
money from A.T.M.’s and news broadcasting crews staring at blank
computer screens, came as the North’s official Korean Central News
Agency quoted the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as threatening to
destroy government installations in the South, along with American
bases in the Pacific.
Target: Three broadcasting stations and a bank in South Korea.

Yesterday, June 25, the Korean peninsula observed a series of
cyberattacks coinciding with the 63rd anniversary of the start of the

Breach of Sony Pictures Entertainment
The attack on Sony Pictures became public knowledge on November
24, 2014, when Sony employees turned on their computers to be
greeted with the sight of a neon red skeleton and the words “Hacked
by GOP”, which stood for “Guardians of the Peace”. The message
also threatened to release data later that day if an unspecified
request was not met. Over the following weeks, huge swathes of
information stolen from Sony were released, including: personal
information about employees and their families; email
correspondence between employees at the company; information
about company salaries, unreleased Sony films, and other
information.
Target: Sony Pictures Entertainment (released the “Interview” movie,
ridiculing the North Korean leader).
Method: Infecting with malware, stealing and wiping data of the
company’s employees, correspondence, copies of unreleased films.

North Korean Tunneling Tool: ELECTRICFISH
This report provides analysis of one malicious 32-bit Windows
executable file. The malware implements a custom protocol that
allows traffic to be funneled between a source and a destination
Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to
reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows
either side to initiate a funneling session. The malware can be
configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and
password. This feature allows connectivity to a system sitting inside
of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised
system’s required authentication to reach outside of the network.

Multinational, multi-industry companies involved in the manufacture of
textiles, chemicals, and electronics
Pharmaceutical companies
A company in the chemical industry
University faculty specializing in aeronautical engineering and research
A company involved in the design and manufacture of motor vehicles
A cybersecurity company focusing on protecting industrial control systems

During these intrusions, Lead’s objective was to steal sensitive data, including
research materials, process documents, and project plans. Lead also steals
code-signing certificates to sign its malware in subsequent attacks.
In most cases, Lead’s attacks do not feature any advanced exploit techniques.
The group also does not make special effort to cultivate victims prior to an attack.
Instead, the group often simply emails a Winnti installer to potential victims,
relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the
attached malware. In some other cases, Lead gains access to a target by bruteforcing remote access login credentials, performing SQL injection, or exploiting
unpatched web servers, and then they copy the Winnti installer directly to
compromised machines.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) Symantec has uncovered the operations of a threat actor named
Leafminer that is targeting a broad list of government organizations and business
verticals in various regions in the Middle East since at least early 2017. The group
tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and
experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to
infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole
websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and bruteforce/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that
the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised
target systems.
(Dragos) Analysis of Raspite tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate
the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. Raspite targeting
includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against
electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.
Raspite leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target
networks. Raspite uses the same methodology as Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0 and
Allanite in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from
which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a
malicious service to beacon back to Raspite -controlled infrastructure, allowing the
adversary to remotely access the victim machine.

Description

(FireEye) FireEye is highlighting a cyber espionage operation targeting crucial
technologies and traditional intelligence targets from a China-nexus state
sponsored actor we call APT40. The actor has conducted operations since at least
2013 in support of China’s naval modernization effort. The group has specifically
targeted engineering, transportation, and the defense industry, especially where
these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. More recently, we have also
observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the Belt and Road
Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines,
Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United
Kingdom. This China-nexus cyber espionage group was previously reported as
TEMP.Periscope and TEMP.Jumper.

Observed

Sectors: Maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including Defense,
Engineering, Government, Manufacturing, Research Shipping and Transportation.
Countries: Belgium, Cambodia, Germany, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Norway
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, USA and UK, and Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).

Spear-phishing maritime and defense targets
Proofpoint researchers are tracking an espionage actor targeting
organizations and high-value targets in defense and government.
Active since at least 2014, this actor has long-standing interest in
maritime industries, naval defense contractors, and associated
research institutions in the United States and Western Europe.

Targeting UK-Based Engineering Company Using Russian APT
Techniques
Employees of a U.K.-based engineering company were among the
targeted victims of a spear-phishing campaign in early July 2018. The
campaign also targeted an email address possibly belonging to a
freelance journalist based in Cambodia who covers Cambodian
politics, human rights, and Chinese development. We believe both
attacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by
Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope (also known as Leviathan),
which targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018
elections. Crucially, TEMP.Periscope’s interest in the U.K. engineering

The current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since
summer 2017. Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors,
TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed
conducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this

engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes,
academic organizations, and private firms in the United States.

extensive interest in Cambodia’s politics, with active compromises of
multiple Cambodian entities related to the country’s electoral system.
This includes compromises of Cambodian government entities
charged with overseeing the elections, as well as the targeting of
opposition figures. This campaign occurs in the run up to the country’s
July 29, 2018, general elections.

Information theft and espionage

Description

Some operations and tooling used by this group were exposed in the [Vault 7/8]
leaks on WikiLeaks in 2017.
(Symantec) Longhorn has been active since at least 2011. It has used a range of
back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets.
Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in
addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information
technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations
targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker.
Longhorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East,
Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was
compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours,
which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally.
Longhorn’s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations,
with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The
malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at
only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of
communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions.
For C&C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address
combination per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers;
however they use privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are
typically owned by legitimate companies offering virtual private server (VPS) or
webhosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS
using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect communications from
identification.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) A series of attacks, targeting both Indian military research and south
Asian shipping organizations, demonstrate the minimum level of effort required to
successfully compromise a target and steal sensitive information. The attackers use
very simple malware, which required little development time or skills, in conjunction
with freely available Web hosting, to implement a highly effective attack. It is a case
of the attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows
how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in
order to steal the information they are after. The attack begins, as is often the case,
with an email sent to the victim. A malicious document is attached to the email,
which, when loaded, activates the malware. The attackers use tailored emails to
encourage the victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an
academic claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP).
The vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The
victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian
and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear
goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In
other cases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every
file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one
particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different attacker
IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address
range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two were based in South
Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that the IP addresses are being
used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.
The attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The
attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the minimum amount of work
necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day exploits or complicated
threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures
on the part of the victims.

Lurk

Lurk (Kaspersky)

Motivation

Financial gain

Description

(Kaspersky) When we first encountered Lurk, in 2011, it was a nameless Trojan. It
all started when we became aware of a number of incidents at several Russian
banks that had resulted in the theft of large sums of money from customers. To
steal the money, the unknown criminals used a hidden malicious program that was
able to interact automatically with the financial institution’s remote banking service
(RBS) software; replacing bank details in payment orders generated by an
accountant at the attacked organization, or even generating such orders by itself.
In 2016, it is hard to imagine banking software that does not demand some form of
additional authentication, but things were different back in 2011. In most cases, the
attackers only had to infect the computer on which the RBS software was installed
in order to start stealing the cash. Russia’s banking system, like those of many
other countries, was unprepared for such attacks, and cybercriminals were quick to
exploit the security gap.
So we decided to take a closer look at the malware. The first attempts to
understand how the program worked gave our analysts nothing. Regardless of
whether it was launched on a virtual or a real machine, it behaved in the same way:
it didn’t do anything. This is how the program, and later the group behind it, got its
name. To “lurk” means to hide, generally with the intention of ambush.
We were soon able to help investigate another incident involving Lurk. This time we
got a chance to explore the image of the attacked computer. There, in addition to
the familiar malicious program, we found a .dll file with which the main executable
file could interact. This was our first piece of evidence that Lurk had a modular
structure.
Later discoveries suggest that, in 2011, Lurk was still at an early stage of
development. It was formed of just two components, a number that would grow
considerably over the coming years.

Description

(Dragos) Covellite compromises networks associated with civilian electric energy
worldwide and gathers intelligence on intellectual property and internal industrial
operations. Covellite lacks an industrial control system (ICS) specific capability at
this time.

Covellite operates globally with targets primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North
America. US targets emerged in September 2017 with a small, targeted phishing
campaign directed at select U.S. electric companies. The phishing emails contain
a malicious Microsoft Word document and infected computers with malware.

The malicious emails discovered in the fall masqueraded as resumes or invitation
They delivered a remote access tool (RAT) payload which was used to conduct
reconnaissance and enable persistent, covert access to victims’ machines.

Covellite’s infrastructure and malware are similar to the hacking organization know
as Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima by Novetta and Hidden Cob
by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Lazarus Group is responsible for attacks ranging from the 2014 attack on Sony
Pictures to a number of Bitcoin heists in 2017. Technical analysis of Covellite
malware indicates an evolution from known Lazarus toolkits. However, aside from
technical overlap, it is not known how the capabilities and operations between
Covellite and Lazarus are related.

Covellite remains active but appears to have abandoned North American targets,
with indications of activity in Europe and East Asia. Given the group’s specific
interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of

Operation “Moonlight”
Vectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a
group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against
entities in the Middle East. We identified over 200 samples of malware
generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are
themed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation
appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal
intentions.

One interesting new fact about Gaza Cybergang activities is that they
are actively sending malware files to IT (Information Technology) and
IR (Incident Response) staff; this is also obvious from the file names
they are sending to victims, which reflect the IT functions or IR tools
used in cyberattack investigations.

Operation “DustySky”
These attacks are targeted, but not spear-phished. I.e., malicious
email messages are sent to selected targets rather than random mass
distribution, but are not tailored specifically to each and every target.
Dozens of targets may receive the exact same message. The email
message and the lure document are written in Hebrew, Arabic or
English –depending on the target audience. Targeted sectors include
governmental and diplomatic institutions, including embassies;
companies from the aerospace and defense Industries; financial
institutions; journalists; software developers. The attackers have been
targeting software developers in general, using a fake website
pretending to be a legitimate iOS management software, and linking to
it in an online freelancing marketplace.

Apr 2016

Operation “DustySky” Part 2
Attacks against all targets in the Middle East stopped at once, after we
published our first report. However, the attacks against targets in the
Middle East (except Israel) were renewed in less than 20 days. In the
beginning of April 2016, we found evidence that the attacks against
Israel have been renewed as well. Based on the type of targets, on
Gaza being the source of the attacks, and on the type of information
the attackers are after –we estimate with medium-high certainty that
the Hamas terrorist organization is behind these attacks.

PwC analysts have been tracking the same malware campaign, which
has seen a noticeable spike since at least April 2016. The attackers
have targeted Arabic news websites, political figures and other targets
that possess influence in the Palestinian territories and other
neighbouring Arab countries.
Our investigation began by analysing around 20 executable files
associated with the attacks. Several of these files opened decoy
documents and audio files, which were exclusively in Arabic-language.

New targets, use of MS Access Macros and CVE 2017-0199, and
possible mobile espionage
One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its
discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region,
infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.
Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE
2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the
download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their
detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late
April 2017, are also being investigated.

New Attack in the Middle East
Recently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center captured a bait document
designed specifically for Arabic users. It is an Office Word document
with malicious macros embedded to drop and execute a backdoor
packed by Enigma Virtual Box. The backdoor program has a built-in
keyword list containing names of people or opera movies to
communicate with C2, distributes control commands to further control
the victim’s computer device. After investigation, we suspect this

attacks on financial institutions and legal firms in the USA, UK and Russia. The
group has primarily been targeting card processing systems, including the AWS
CBR (Russian Interbank System) and purportedly SWIFT (US). Given the wide
usage of STAR in LATAM, financial institutions in LATAM could have particular
exposure to a potential interest from the MoneyTaker group.
Although the group has been successful at targeting a number of banks in different
countries, to date, they have gone unreported. In addition to banks, the
MoneyTaker group has attacked law firms and also financial software vendors. In
total, Group-IB has confirmed 20 companies as MoneyTaker victims, with 16
attacks on US organizations, 3 attacks on Russian banks and 1 in the UK.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Reaqta) MuddyWater is an APT group that has been active throughout 2017,
targeting victims in Middle East with in-memory vectors leveraging on Powershell,
in a family of attacks now identified as “Living off the land”, as they don’t require the
creation of new binaries on the victim’s machine, thus maintaining a low detection
profile and a low forensic footprint.
The operators behind MuddyWater are likely espionage motivated, we derive this
information from the analysis of data and backdoors behaviors. We also find that
despite the strong preponderance of victims from Pakistan, the most active targets
appear to be in: Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq. Amongst the victims we identify a
variety of entities with a stronger focus at Governments, Telcos and Oil companies.
By tracking the operations we finally figure out that the originating country is likely
to be Iran, while it remains harder to ascertain whether MuddyWater is state
sponsored or a criminal organization incline to espionage.

Another Potential MuddyWater Campaign uses Powershell-based
PRB-Backdoor
In May 2018, we found a new sample (Detected as
W2KM_DLOADR.UHAOEEN) that may be related to this campaign.
Like the previous campaigns, these samples again involve a Microsoft
Word document embedded with a malicious macro that is capable of
executing PowerShell (PS) scripts leading to a backdoor payload. One
notable difference in the analyzed samples is that they do not directly
download the Visual Basic Script(VBS) and PowerShell component
files, and instead encode all the scripts on the document itself. The
scripts will then be decoded and dropped to execute the payload
without needing to download the component files.

MuddyWater has recently been targeting victims likely from Lebanon
and Oman, while leveraging compromised domains, one of which is
owned by an Israeli web developer. The investigation aimed to
uncover additional details regarding the compromise vector. Further,
we wished to determine the infection vector, which is currently
unknown. With that in mind, past experience implies that this might be

Description

(CrowdStrike) In April 2017, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence observed a previously
unattributed actor group with a Chinese nexus targeting a U.S.-based think tank.
Further analysis revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs). This adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
in general, but uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor
has a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns
involve the use of shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX.
Recently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from Mustang Panda, using a
unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly observed
activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of
legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems. Additionally, Mustang
Panda actors reused previously-observed legitimate domains to host files.

BKDR_RARSTONE RAT
Last year, we reported about PlugX a breed of Remote Access Trojan
(RAT) used in certain high-profile APT campaigns. We also noted
some of its noteworthy techniques, which include its capability to hide
its malicious codes by decrypting and loading a backdoor “executable
file” directly into memory, without the need to drop the actual
“executable file”.
Recently, we uncovered a RAT using the same technique. The new
sample detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_RARSTONE.A is similar
(but not) PlugX, as it directly loads a backdoor “file” in memory without
dropping any “file”. However, as we proceeded with our analysis, we
found that BKDR_RARSTONE has some tricks of its own.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(McAfee) Starting in November 2009, coordinated covert and targeted cyberattacks
have been conducted against global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies.
These attacks have involved social engineering, spear-phishing attacks,
exploitation of Microsoft Windows operating systems vulnerabilities, Microsoft
Active Directory compromises, and the use of remote administration tools (RATs) in
targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and projectfinancing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations.
Attackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&C servers on
purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the
Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies,
as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the
United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary
operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools,
including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete
remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to
Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to
completely control the affected system. To deploy these tools, attackers first
compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet
web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops,
and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company’s
defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of
targeted companies’ networked computers.

this point, the current attack campaign against the chemical industry began. This
particular attack has lasted much longer than previous attacks, spanning two and a
half months.
A total of 29 companies in the chemical sector were confirmed to be targeted in this
attack wave and another 19 in various other sectors, primarily the defense sector,
were seen to be affected as well. These 48 companies are the minimum number of
companies targeted and likely other companies were also targeted. In a recent two

that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure
details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting
that aligns with nation-state interests. This group was previously tracked under two
distinct groups, APT 34 and OilRig, but was combined due to additional reporting
giving higher confidence about the overlap of the activity.
OilRig seems to be closely related to APT 33, Elfin.

Shamoon Attacks
W32.Disttrack is a new threat that is being used in specific targeted
attacks against at least one organization in the energy sector. It is a
destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer
and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a
computer unusable.
Target: Saudi Aramco and Rasgas.

Targeted Attacks against Banks in the Middle East
In the first week of May 2016, FireEye’s DTI identified a wave of
emails containing malicious attachments being sent to multiple banks
in the Middle East region. The threat actors appear to be performing
initial reconnaissance against would-be targets, and the attacks
caught our attention since they were using unique scripts not
commonly seen in crimeware campaigns.

Shamoon v2
The malware used in the recent attacks (W32.Disttrack.B) is largely
unchanged from the variant used four years ago. In the 2012 attacks,
infected computers had their master boot records wiped and replaced
with an image of a burning US flag. The latest attacks instead used a
photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, the three year-old Syrian refugee who
drowned in the Mediterranean last year.

We have identified two separate testing efforts carried out by the
OilRig actors, one occurring in June and one in November of 2016.
The sample set associated with each of these testing activities is
rather small, but the changes made to each of the files give us a
chance to understand what modifications the actor performs in an
attempt to evade detection. This testing activity also suggests that the
threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign have an
organized, professional operations model that includes a testing
component to the development of their tools.

Oct 2016

In recent weeks we’ve discovered that the group have been actively
updating their Clayslide delivery documents, as well as the Helminth
backdoor used against victims. Additionally, the scope of
organizations targeted by this group has expanded to not only include
organizations within Saudi Arabia, but also a company in Qatar and
government organizations in Turkey, Israel and the United States.

Delivers Digitally Signed Malware, Impersonates University of Oxford
In recent attacks they set up a fake VPN Web Portal and targeted at
least five Israeli IT vendors, several financial institutes, and the Israeli
Post Office.
Later, the attackers set up two fake websites pretending to be a
University of Oxford conference sign-up page and a job application
website. In these websites they hosted malware that was digitally
signed with a valid, likely stolen code signing certificate.

In July 2017, we observed the OilRig group using a tool they
developed called ISMAgent in a new set of targeted attacks. The
OilRig group developed ISMAgent as a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan.
In August 2017, we found this threat group has developed yet another
Trojan that they call ‘Agent Injector’ with the specific purpose of
installing the ISMAgent backdoor. We are tracking this tool as
ISMInjector.

Subgroup: Greenbug
Names

Greenbug (Symantec)

Country

Iran

Description

(Symantec) Symantec discovered the Greenbug cyberespionage group during its
investigation into previous attacks involving W32.Disttrack.B (aka Shamoon).
Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first made headlines in 2012 when it was used in attacks
against energy companies in Saudi Arabia. It recently resurfaced in November
2016 (W32.Disttrack.B), again attacking targets in Saudi Arabia. While these
attacks were covered extensively in the media, how the attackers stole these
credentials and introduced W32.Disttrack on targeted organizations’ networks
remains a mystery.
Could Greenbug be responsible for getting Shamoon those stolen credentials?
Although there is no definitive link between Greenbug and Shamoon, the group
compromised at least one administrator computer within a Shamoon-targeted
organization’s network prior to W32.Disttrack.B being deployed on November 17,
2016.

Operation BugDrop (CyberX)

Country

Russia

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(CyberX) CyberX has discovered a new, large-scale cyber-reconnaissance
operation targeting a broad range of targets in the Ukraine. Because it
eavesdrops on sensitive conversations by remotely controlling PC microphones –
in order to surreptitiously “bug” its targets – and uses Dropbox to store exfiltrated
data, CyberX has named it “Operation BugDrop.”
CyberX has confirmed at least 70 victims successfully targeted by the operation
in a range of sectors including critical infrastructure, media, and scientific
research. The operation seeks to capture a range of sensitive information from its
targets including audio recordings of conversations, screen shots, documents and
passwords. Unlike video recordings, which are often blocked by users simply
placing tape over the camera lens, it is virtually impossible to block your
computer’s microphone without physically accessing and disabling the PC
hardware.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) Kaspersky Lab has observed new waves of attacks that started on
the 8th and the 27th of June 2016. These have been highly active in the Middle
East region and unveiled ongoing targeted attacks in multiple regions. The
attackers try to lure targets through spear phishing emails that include
compressed executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords,
keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.
We found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial,
engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30 countries. In total,
over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using
the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and
attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is
that since the beginning of their activities, the attackers’ motivations are
apparently financial, whether through the victims’ banking accounts or through
selling their intellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim
organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300
employees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the
attribution of the attacks more difficult.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(ESET) After BlackEnergy, which has, most infamously, facilitated attacks that
resulted in power outages for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and
Operation Potao Express, where attackers went after sensitive TrueCryptprotected data from high value targets, ESET researchers have uncovered
another cyberespionage operation in Ukraine: Operation Groundbait.
The main point that sets Operation Groundbait apart from the other attacks is that
it has mostly been targeting anti-government separatists in the self-declared
Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.
While the attackers seem to be more interested in separatists and the selfdeclared governments in eastern Ukrainian war zones, there have also been a
large number of other targets, including, among others, Ukrainian government
officials, politicians and journalists.

Operation Parliament

Operation Parliament (Kaspersky)

Country

[Unknown]

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a
previously unknown geopolitically motivated threat actor. The campaign started in
2017, with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. They most
likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to
an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel
worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems
range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain
controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including
those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so
on.
Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in
the Middle East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the
radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly
careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding
their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down
since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or
access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen
behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points
to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the
attacks (physical and/or digital).
With deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors,
attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially
in complex regions such as the Middle East.

Description

(Symantec) Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called
Orangeworm that has been observed installing a custom backdoor called
Trojan.Kwampirs within large international corporations that operate within the
healthcare sector in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
First identified in January 2015, Orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks
against organizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in
order to reach their intended victims. Known victims include healthcare providers,
pharmaceuticals, IT solution providers for healthcare and equipment manufacturers
that serve the healthcare industry, likely for the purpose of corporate espionage.
Based on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets
randomly or conduct opportunistic hacking. Rather, the group appears to choose its
targets carefully and deliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before
launching an attack.
According to Symantec telemetry, almost 40 percent of Orangeworm’s confirmed
victim organizations operate within the healthcare industry. The Kwampirs malware
was found on machines which had software installed for the use and control of
high-tech imaging devices such as X-Ray and MRI machines. Additionally,
Orangeworm was observed to have an interest in machines used to assist patients
in completing consent forms for required procedures. The exact motives of the
group are unclear.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Cylance) Snorre Fagerland of Blue Coat Systems first coined the term PassCV in a
blog post. His post provides a good introduction to the group and covers some of
the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing certificate reuse, and other connections
associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues alluding to the
possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates,
but at this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being
perpetrated by a single group employing multiple publicly available Remote
Administration Tools (RATs).
The PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already
started to expand their malware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and
custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen previously undisclosed stolen
Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to companies
and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States
and Russia.
The PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some
custom code, which ultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems
via phony resumes and curriculum vitae (CVs). PassCV continues to maintain a
heavy reliance on obfuscated and signed versions of older RATs like ZxShell and
Ghost RAT, which have remained a favorite of the wider Chinese criminal
community since their initial public release.

(Cymmetria) Patchwork is a targeted attack that has infected an estimated 2,500
machines since it was first observed in December 2015. There are indications of
activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has not observed any such activity first
hand.
Patchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on
military and political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating
to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments
and government-related organizations.
The code used by this threat actor is copy-pasted from various online forums, in a
way that reminds us of a patchwork quilt –hence the name we’ve given the
operation.
In active victim systems, Patchwork immediately searches for and uploads
documents to their C&C, and only if the target is deemed valuable enough,
proceeds to install a more advanced second stage malware.
This group seems to be associated with Confucius.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Airbus) Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers that have been active since at least 2011.
They have targeted private companies in several sectors, such as defense and
telecommunications, but also at least one government.
We have been able to track down this group of attackers and can provide detailed
information about them. We were able to collect and reveal their “malware arsenal”.
We also analyzed their technical organization.
Our investigations indicate that Pitty Tiger has not used any 0day vulnerability so
far, rather they prefer using custom malware, developed for the group’s exclusive
usage. Our discoveries indicate that Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers with the
ability to stay under the radar, yet still not as mature as other groups of attackers
we monitor.
Pitty Tiger is probably not a state-sponsored group of attackers. They lack the
experience and financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored
attackers. We suppose this group is opportunistic and sells its services to probable
competitors of their targets in the private sector.
We have been able to leverage several attackers profiles, showing that the Pitty
Tiger group is fairly small compared to other APT groups, which is probably why we
saw them work on a very limited amount of targets.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Microsoft) Platinum has been targeting its victims since at least as early as 2009,
and may have been active for several years prior. Its activities are distinctly different
not only from those typically seen in untargeted attacks, but from many targeted
attacks as well. A large share of targeted attacks can be characterized as
opportunistic: the activity group changes its target profiles and attack geographies
based on geopolitical seasons, and may attack institutions all over the world. Like
many such groups, Platinum seeks to steal sensitive intellectual property related to
government interests, but its range of preferred targets is consistently limited to
specific governmental organizations, defense institutes, intelligence agencies,
diplomatic institutions, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast
Asia. The group’s persistent use of spear-phishing tactics (phishing attempts aimed
at specific individuals) and access to previously undiscovered zero-day exploits
have made it a highly resilient threat.

Since the 2016 publication, Microsoft has come across an evolution of
PLATINUM’s file-transfer tool, one that uses the Intel Active
Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel for
communication. This channel works independently of the operating
system (OS), rendering any communication over it invisible to firewall
and network monitoring applications running on the host device. Until
this incident, no malware had been discovered misusing the AMT SOL
feature for communication.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) During the latter part of 2015, Kaspersky researchers from GreAT
(Global Research and Analysis Team) got hold of the missing pieces of an intricate
puzzle that points to the dawn of the first Portuguese-speaking targeted attack
group, named “Poseidon.” The group’s campaigns appear to have been active
since at least 2005, while the very first sample found points to 2001. This signals
just how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive
framework.
The Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and
sea. They are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively
collect information from company networks through the use of spear-phishing
packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents and
extensive lateral movement tools. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a
company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group
as a security firm. Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its
infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the network to
continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The Poseidon Group has
been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their
tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems
spanning the gamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use
of hijacked satellite connections. Poseidon continues to be active at this time.

Description

Promethium is an activity group that has been active since at least 2012. The group
conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims.
Promethium has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called
Neodymium due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics.
(Microsoft) Promethium is an activity group that has been active as early as 2012.
The group primarily uses Truvasys, a first-stage malware that has been in
circulation for several years. Truvasys has been involved in several attack
campaigns, where it has masqueraded as one of server common computer utilities,
including WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, or SanDisk. In each of the campaigns,
Truvasys malware evolved with additional features—this shows a close relationship
between the activity groups behind the campaigns and the developers of the
malware.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Palo Alto) Throughout 2017 and 2018 Unit 42 has been tracking and observing a
series of highly targeted attacks focused in South East Asia, building on our
research into the KHRAT Trojan. Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to
be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware
families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution
of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42
believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for
espionage purposes.
We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have
dubbed it “Rancor”. The Rancor group’s attacks use two primary malware families
which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and
PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to
be new addition to these attackers’ toolkit.

Motivation

Financial gain

Description

(ESET) There are several groups actively and profitably targeting businesses in
Russia. A trend that we have seen unfold before our eyes lately is these
cybercriminals’ use of simple backdoors to gain a foothold in their targets’ networks.
Once they have this access, a lot of the work is done manually, slowly getting to
understand the network layout and deploying custom tools the criminals can use to
steal funds from these entities. Some of the groups that best exemplify these trends
are Buhtrap, Cobalt Group and Corkow, Metel.
The group discussed in this white paper is part of this new trend. We call this new
group RTM; it uses custom malware, written in Delphi, that we cover in detail in
later sections. The first trace of this tool in our telemetry data dates back to late
2015. The group also makes use of several different modules that they deploy
where appropriate to their targets. They are interested in users of remote banking
systems (RBS), mainly in Russia and neighboring countries.

Observed

That this group is mostly targeting businesses is apparent from the processes they
are looking for on a compromised system. They look for software that is usually
only installed on accountants’ computers, such as remote banking software or tools
to help with accounts pay.
Countries: Czech, Germany, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine.

disconnect power substations for no apparent reason. The same
report goes on to describe a virus was launched from the outside and
it brought down the “remote management system” (a reference to the
SCADA and or EMS). The outage was reported to have lasted six
hours before electrical service was restored. At least two reports
suggest the utility had initiated manual controls for restoration of
service and the SCADA system was still off-line due to the infection.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(CrowdStrike) Samurai Panda is interesting in that their target selection tends to
focus on Asia Pacific victims in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other democratic
Asian victims. Beginning in 2009, we’ve observed this actor conduct more than 40
unique campaigns that we’ve identified in the malware configurations’ campaign
codes. These codes are often leveraged in the malware used by coordinated
targeted attackers to differentiate victims that were successfully compromised from
different target sets.
The implant delivered by Samurai Panda uses a typical installation process
whereby they:
1. Leverage a spear-phish with an exploit to get control of the execution flow of
the targeted application. This file “drops” an XOR-encoded payload that
unpacks itself and a configuration file.
2. Next, the implant, which can perform in several different modes, typically will
install itself as a service and then begin beaconing out to an adversarycontrolled host.
3. If that command-and-control host is online, the malicious service will download
and instantiate a backdoor that provides remote access to the attacker, who will
see the infected host’s identification information as well as the campaign code.

Description

(Kaspersky) A few of months ago, we deployed a new set of technologies into our
products designed to identify and block zero day attacks. These technologies
already proved its effectiveness earlier this year, when they caught an Adobe Flash
zero day exploit, CVE-2016-1010. Earlier this month, we caught another zero-day
Adobe Flash Player exploit deployed in targeted attacks.
We believe these attacks are launched by an APT Group we call “ScarCruft”.
ScarCruft is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in several
countries, including Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, Kuwait and
Romania. The group has several ongoing operations utilizing multiple exploits —
two for Adobe Flash and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Currently, the group is engaged in two major operations: Operation Daybreak and
Operation Erebus. The first of them, Operation Daybreak, appears to have been
launched by ScarCruft in March 2016 and employs a previously unknown (0-day)
Adobe Flash Player exploit, focusing on high profile victims. The other one,
“Operation Erebus” employs an older exploit, for CVE-2016-4117 and leverages
watering holes. It is also possible that the group deployed another zero day exploit,
CVE-2016-0147, which was patched in April.

We recently discovered some interesting telemetry on this actor, and
decided to dig deeper into ScarCruft’s recent activity. This shows that
the actor is still very active and constantly trying to elaborate its attack
tools. Based on our telemetry, we can reassemble ScarCruft’s binary
infection procedure. It used a multi-stage binary infection to update
each module effectively and evade detection.

Country

China

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

Scarlet Mimic is a threat group that has targeted minority rights activists. This group
has not been directly linked to a government source, but the group’s motivations
appear to overlap with those of the Chinese government. While there is some
overlap between IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and Putter Panda, APT 2, it
has not been concluded that the groups are the same.
(Palo Alto) The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern
suggests that this adversary’s primary mission is to gather information about
minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a
government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an
assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of
the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.
The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and
Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the
Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in
northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past
decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the
People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links
Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC.
Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations
in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities.
While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many
of them align to the patterns described above.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Talos) Cisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling
“Sea Turtle,” which is targeting public and private entities, including national
security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The
ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued
through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different
organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this
campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by
an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to
sensitive networks and systems.
The actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a
mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the
actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled
servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this
activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and
obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names.

Description

(Information Warfare Monitor) Shadows in the Cloud documents a complex
ecosystem of cyber espionage that systematically compromised government,
business, academic, and other computer network systems in India, the Offices of
the Dalai Lama, the United Nations, and several other countries. The report also
contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets and
recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the
Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security
establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous thirdparty countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also
exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes
the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged
multiple redundant cloud computing systems, social networking platforms, and free
web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core
servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and
motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the
location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers
through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month,
collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and
SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion
methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field
research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

the gang members appears to be a former or current employee of a cyber security
company. The confirmed damage from Silence activity is estimated at 800 000
USD.
Silence is a group of Russian-speaking hackers, based on their commands
language, the location of infrastructure they used, and the geography of their
targets (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Poland, and Kazakhstan). Although
phishing emails were also sent to bank employees in Central and Western Europe,
Africa, and Asia). Furthermore, Silence used Russian words typed on an English
keyboard layout for the commands of the employed backdoor. The hackers also
used Russian-language web hosting services.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

In February 2016, Iran-focused individuals received messages purporting to be
from Human RightsWatch's (HRW) Emergencies Director, requesting that they read
an article about Iran pressing Afghan refugees to fight in Syria. While referencing a
real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director’s biography and
article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing
attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering
tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical
and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors
demonstrated stronger English-language proficiency than past intrusion sets and a
deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors
appropriated a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with
the subject, then offered validation through links to their biography and social
media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents
contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the
message attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or
field of employment. The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing
as legitimate files using the common right-to-left filenames tactic in order to conceal
the actual file extension. All of these techniques, while common pretexting
mechanisms, are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to
simply continually send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes
that one would eventually be successful.

This group targets Iranians in diaspora.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) While analysing an incident which involved a suspected keylogger, we
identified a malicious library able to interact with a virtual file system, which is
usually the sign of an advanced APT actor. This turned out to be a malicious loader
internally named ‘Slingshot’, part of a new, and highly sophisticated attack platform
that rivals Project Sauron and Regin in complexity.
While for most victims the infection vector for Slingshot remains unknown, we were
able to find several cases where the attackers got access to MikroTik routers and
placed a component downloaded by Winbox Loader, a management suite for
MikroTik routers. In turn, this infected the administrator of the router.
We believe this cluster of activity started in at least 2012 and was still active at the
time of this analysis (February 2018).

Description

(Cylance) While investigating some of the smaller name servers that Sofacy, APT
28, Fancy Bear, Sednit routinely use to host their infrastructure, Cylance discovered
another prolonged campaign that appeared to exclusively target Japanese
companies and individuals that began around August 2016. The later registration
style was eerily close to previously registered APT28 domains, however, the
malware used in the attacks did not seem to line up at all. During the course of our
investigation, JPCERT published this analysis of one of the group’s backdoors.
Cylance tracks this threat group internally as ‘Snake Wine’.
The Snake Wine group has proven to be highly adaptable and has continued to
adopt new tactics in order to establish footholds inside victim environments. The
exclusive interest in Japanese government, education, and commerce will likely
continue into the future as the group is just starting to build and utilize their existing
current attack infrastructure.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(GData) The revelation about the existence of yet another potentially nation-state
driven spyware occurred in March 2014 when Le Monde first published information
about top secret slides originating from 2011 and part of their content . But the
slides Le Monde published revealed only a small part of the picture – several slides
were cut out, some information was redacted. Germany’s Der Spiegel re-published
the slide set with far less deletions recently, in January 2015, and therefore gave a
deeper insight about what CSEC actually says they have tracked down.
The newly published documents reveal: the so called operation SNOWGLOBE, was
discovered in 2009 (slide 9) and consists of three different “implants”, two were
dubbed snowballs and one “more sophisticated implant, discovered in mid-2010” is
tagged as snowman (slide 7). According to slide 22, “CSEC assesses, with
moderate certainty, SNOWGLOBE to be a state-sponsored CNO [Cyber Network
Operation] effort, put forth by a French intelligence agency.” The information given
dates back to 2011 and nothing else has been published since. Now that specific
Babar samples have been identified and analyzed, there might be new information,
also with regards to similarities or differences between the two Remote

Description

APT 28 is a threat group that has been attributed to Russia’s Main Intelligence
Directorate of the Russian General Staff by a July 2018 U.S. Department of Justice
indictment. This group reportedly compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the
Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee in 2016 in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. APT
28 has been active since at least January 2007.
(FireEye) APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia’s security and
political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and the Ministry of Defense.
APT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security
organizations. These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability
to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion.
APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security
organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long
cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential
threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.

Operations
performed

2011-2012

Back in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known
as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant
shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us
to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with,
although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original
Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.

2013

At some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal
and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM
(aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code
from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI,
EVILTOSS, and spans across four to five generations) and a few
others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants and they
were relatively widespread for a time.

Breach of Democratic National Committee
Fancy Bear carried out spear-phishing attacks on email addresses
associated with the Democratic National Committee in the first
quarter of 2016. On March 10, phishing emails that were mainly
directed at old email addresses of 2008 Democratic campaign
staffers began to arrive. One of these accounts may have yielded up
to date contact lists. The next day, phishing attacks expanded to the
non-public email addresses of high level Democratic Party officials.
Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two factor
authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail
accounts on March 19th. Podesta’s Gmail account was breached the
same day, with 50,000 emails stolen.
Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian
Federation, nicknamed APT 29, Cozy Bear, The Dukes appears to
be a different agency, one more interested in traditional long-term

 Industrial and hydro chemical engineering and
standards/certification
 Ministry of foreign affairs
 Embassies and consulates
 National security and intelligence agencies
 Press services
 Translation services
 NGO – family and social service
 Ministry of energy and industry
Method: the Zebrocy chain follows a pattern: spear-phish attachment
-> compiled Autoit script (downloader) -> Zebrocy payload. In some
deployments, we observed Sofacy actively developing and deploying
a new package to a much smaller, specific subset of targets within
the broader set.

early 2017, were leaked in apparent retaliation for the IOC’s banning
of Russian athletes from the 2018 Winter Olympics as a sanction for
Russia’s systematic doping program. The attack resembles the
earlier World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) leaks. It is not known
whether the emails are fully authentic, because of Fancy Bear’s
history of salting stolen emails with disinformation. The mode of
attack was also not known, but was probably phishing.

Sowbug (Symantec)

Country

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Sowbug
that has been conducting highly targeted cyberattacks against organizations in
South America and Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign
policy institutions and diplomatic targets. Sowbug has been seen mounting classic
espionage attacks by stealing documents from the organizations it infiltrates.
Symantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in
March 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a
target in Southeast Asia. We have subsequently identified further victims on both
sides of the Pacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of
this year, its association with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also
been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it
has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even
earlier.
To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South
America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil,
Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of
infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and will often operate outside the working
hours of targeted organizations in order to maintain a low profile.

(Raytheon) The group appears to have close ties to the Chinese National University
of Defense and Technology, which is possibly linked to the PLA. Stalker Panda has
been observed conducting targeted attacks against Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
and the United States. The attacks appear to be centered on political, media, and
engineering sectors. The group appears to have been active since around 2010
and they maintain and upgrade their tools regularly.
A fairly unique aspect of the observed Stalker Panda attacks is their use of social
media and blog sites as first stage (cutout) command and control (C2)
infrastructure. This 2-stage C2 infrastructure provides some obfuscation of the main
C2 servers and provides some flexibility in communications because the first stage
social media/blog site nodes can be reconfigured at will.
Stalker Panda seems to favor spear phishing email campaigns as their attack
vector.

Observed

Sectors: Engineering, Media and political.
Countries: Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and USA.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Citizen Lab) This report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried
out by a sophisticated operator, which we call Stealth Falcon. The attacks have
been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists,
and dissidents. We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be
from an apparently fictitious organization called “The Right to Fight” contacted Rori
Donaghy. Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for
Human Rights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to
offer him a position on a human rights panel. Donaghy has written critically of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past, and had recently published a
series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE
government.
Circumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE
government. We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an
activist’s Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been
under government control. We also identified other bait content employed by this
threat actor. We found 31 public tweets sent by Stealth Falcon, 30 of which were
directly targeted at one of 27 victims. Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to
the UAE, based on their profile information (e.g., photos, “UAE” in account name,
location), and at least six targets appeared to be operated by people who were
arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE government, in
relation to their Twitter activity.

Stolen Pencil (ASERT)

Country

North Korea

Motivation

[Uncertain]

Description

(ASERT) ASERT has learned of an APT campaign, possibly originating from
DPRK, we are calling Stolen Pencil that is targeting academic institutions since at
least May 2018. The ultimate motivation behind the attacks is unclear, but the
threat actors are adept at scavenging for credentials. Targets are sent spear
phishing e-mails that lead them to a web site displaying a lure document and are
immediately prompted to install a malicious Google Chrome extension. Once
gaining a foothold, the threat actors use off-the-shelf tools to ensure persistence,
including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain access.
Key Findings
 A wide variety of phishing domains imply other targets, but those focused on
academia were intended to install a malicious Chrome extension.
 A large number of the victims, across multiple universities, had expertise in
biomedical engineering, possibly suggesting a motivation for the attackers
targeting.
 Poor OPSEC led to users finding open web browsers in Korean, English-toKorean translators open, and keyboards switched to Korean.
 The threat actors use built-in Windows administration tools and commercial offthe-shelf software to “live off the land”. The threat actor at the keyboard uses
RDP to access compromised systems rather than a backdoor or Remote
Access Trojan (RAT).
 Post-exploitation persistence is maintained by harvesting passwords from a
wide variety of sources such as process memory, web browsers, network
sniffing, and keyloggers.
 There is no evidence of data theft, leaving the motivation behind Stolen Pencil
largely uncertain.

Description

(Symantec) Strider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has
maintained a low profile until now and its targets have been mainly organizations
and individuals that would be of interest to a nation state’s intelligence services.
Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s Remsec malware from a customer who
submitted it following its detection by our behavioral engine.
Remsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected
computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files.
Strider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has
found evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations.
The group’s targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in
Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in
Belgium.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) In March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suckfly, an advanced
cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of South Korean
organizations to steal digital certificates. Since then we have identified a number of
attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to
Suckfly. The attacks targeted high-profile targets, including government and
commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several different countries, but
our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and
organizations primarily located in India.
While there have been several Suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with
the group’s custom malware Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater
amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions. This suggests that
these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in India.

Late 2015

We discovered Suckfly, an advanced threat group, conducting
targeted attacks using multiple stolen certificates, as well as hacktools
and custom malware. The group had obtained the certificates through
pre-attack operations before commencing targeted attacks against a
number of government and commercial organizations spread across
multiple continents over a two-year period. This type of activity and the
malicious use of stolen certificates emphasizes the importance of
safeguarding certificates to prevent them from being used maliciously.

Description

(Proofpoint) On April 20 [2017], Proofpoint observed a targeted campaign focused
on financial analysts working at top global financial firms operating in Russia and
neighboring countries. These analysts were linked by their coverage of the
telecommunications industry, making this targeting very similar to, and likely a
continuation of, activity described in our “In Pursuit of Optical Fibers and Troop
Intel” blog. This time, however, attackers opportunistically used spear-phishing
emails with a Microsoft Word attachment exploiting the recently patched CVE-20170199 to deploy the ZeroT Trojan, which in turn downloaded the PlugX Remote
Access Trojan (RAT).
Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459. The

Description

(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers track a wide range of threat actors involved in
both financially motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored actions. One of the more
prolific actors that we track - referred to as TA505 - is responsible for the largest
malicious spam campaigns we have ever observed, distributing instances of the
Dridex banking Trojan, Locky ransomware, Jaff ransomware, The Trick banking
Trojan, and several others in very high volumes.
Because TA505 is such a significant part of the email threat landscape, this blog
provides a retrospective on the shifting malware, payloads, and campaigns
associated with this actor. We examine their use malware such as Jaff, Bart, and
Rockloader that appear to be exclusive to this group as well as more widely
distributed malware like Dridex and Pony. Where possible, we detail the affiliate
models with which they are involved and outline the current state of TA505
campaigns.
TA505 is arguably one of the most significant financially motivated threat actors
because of the extraordinary volumes of messages they send. The variety of
malware delivered by the group also demonstrates their deep connections to the
underground malware scene. At the time of writing, Locky ransomware remains
their malware of choice, even as the group continues to experiment with a variety of
additional malware.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Trend Micro) The Taidoor attackers have been actively engaging in targeted
attacks since at least March 4, 2009. Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor
campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C&C servers and email
addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments.
One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese
government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to
send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically
leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious
documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control.
As part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy
document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate
document but executes a malicious payload in the background.
We were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor
attackers’ activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find
that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on
compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine
the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we
monitored a compromised honeypot. The attackers issued out some basic
commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but
quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly
disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor
malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted
campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these
from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.

Description

(Kaspersky) Researchers have uncovered a long-term cyber-espionage campaign
that used a combination of legitimate software packages and commodity malware
tools to target a variety of heavy industry, government intelligence agencies and
political activists. Known as the TeamSpy crew because of its affinity for using the
legitimate TeamViewer application as part of its toolset, the attackers may have
been active for as long as 10 years, researchers say.
The attack appears to be a years-long espionage campaign, but experts who have
analyzed the victim profile, malware components and command-and-control
infrastructure say that it’s not entirely clear what kind of data the attackers are going
after. What is clear, though, is that the attackers have been at this for a long time
and that they have specific people in mind as targets.
Researchers at the CrySyS Lab in Hungary were alerted by the Hungarian National
Security Authority to an attack against a high-profile target in the country and began
looking into the campaign. They quickly discovered that some of the infrastructure
being used in the attack had been in use for some time and that the target they

tools is cybersabotage. This blog post outlines the details about the campaign that
we discovered.
We will refer to the gang behind the malware as TeleBots. However it’s important to
say that these attackers, and the toolset used, share a number of similarities with
the BlackEnergy group, which conducted attacks against the energy industry in
Ukraine in December 2015 and January 2016. In fact, we think that the
BlackEnergy group has evolved into the TeleBots group.

Motivation

Sabotage and destruction

Description

(Microsoft) A few weeks ago, multiple organizations in the Middle East fell victim to
targeted and destructive attacks that wiped data from computers, and in many
cases rendering them unstable and unbootable. Destructive attacks like these have
been observed repeatedly over the years and the Windows Defender and Windows
Defender Advanced Threat Protection Threat Intelligence teams are working on
protection, detection, and response to these threats.
Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified similarities between this recent attack and
previous 2012 attacks against tens of thousands of computers belonging to
organizations in the energy sector. Microsoft Threat Intelligence refers to the activity
group behind these attacks as Terbium, following our internal practice of assigning
rogue actors chemical element names.

Motivation

Information theft, espionage and sabotage

Description

(Symantec) Perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had
targeted a satellite communications operator. The attack group seemed to be
particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and
infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This
suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include
disruption.
Another target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping.
Again, Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company.
It targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS)
software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications
or integrating location-based data into other applications. It also targeted machines
running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software.
The satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested
in. The group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in
Southeast Asia. In all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by
Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers
were the targets of these attacks.
In addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.

Description

(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers recently uncovered evidence of an advanced

investigation began with malicious emails sent to Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia
and Kazakstan but turned up connections to watering hole sites focused on Indian
military personnel and designed to drop a remote access Trojan (RAT) with a
variety of data exfiltration functions. Our analysis shows that many of the
campaigns and attacks appear related by common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and
language, but the exact nature and attribution associated with this APT remain
under investigation.
At this time, the background and analysis in this paper provide useful forensics and
detail our current thinking on the malware that we have dubbed “MSIL/Crimson”.

Operation “Moonlight Maze”
That is why our experts, aided by researchers from King’s College
London, have carefully studied Moonlight Maze — one of the first
widely known cyberespionage campaigns, active since at least 1996.
It is of particular interest because several independent experts from
countries have voiced the proposition that it is associated with a much

Operation “Epic Turla”
Over the last 10 months, Kaspersky Lab researchers have analyzed a

Dec 2014

Operation “Penguin Turla”
The Turla APT campaigns have a broader reach than initially
anticipated after the recent discovery of two modules built to infect
servers running Linux. Until now, every Turla sample in captivity was
designed for either 32- or 64-bit Windows systems, but researchers at
Kaspersky Lab have discovered otherwise.
<https://threatpost.com/linux-modules-connected-to-turla-aptdiscovered/109765/>

2015

Operation “Satellite Turla”
Obviously, such incredibly apparent and large-scale attacks have little
chance of surviving for long periods of time, which is one of the key
requirements for running an APT operation. It is therefore not very
feasible to perform the attack through MitM traffic hijacking, unless the
attackers have direct control over some high-traffic network points,
such as backbone routers or fiber optics. There are signs that such
attacks are becoming more common, but there is a much simpler way
to hijack satellite-based Internet traffic.

2015

Operation “WITCHCOVEN”
When an unsuspecting user visits any of the over 100 compromised
websites, a small piece of inserted code—embedded in the site’s
HTML and invisible to casual visitors—quietly redirects the user’s
browser to a second compromised website without the user’s
knowledge. This second website hosts the WITCHCOVEN script,
which uses profiling techniques to collect technical information on the
user’s computer. As of early November 2015, we identified a total of
14 websites hosting the WITCHCOVEN profiling script.

Some of the tactics used in APT attacks die hard. A good example is
provided by Turla’s watering hole campaigns. Turla, which has been
targeting governments, government officials and diplomats for years –
see, as an example, this recent paper – is still using watering hole
techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&C
infrastructure. In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014
with very few variations in their modus operandi.

<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shifttowards-generic-tools/>

2018

Much of our 2018 research focused on Turla’s KopiLuwak javascript
backdoor, new variants of the Carbon framework and meterpreter
delivery techniques. Also interesting was Mosquito’s changing delivery
techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell use,
and borrowed injector code. We tied some of this activity together with
infrastructure and data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito
infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018.

we call Volatile Cedar has been targeting individuals, companies and institutions
worldwide. This campaign, led by a persistent attacker group, has successfully
penetrated a large number of targets using various attack techniques, and
specifically, a custom-made malware implant codenamed Explosive. This report
provides an extended technical analysis of Volatile Cedar and the Explosive
malware.
We have seen clear evidence that Volatile Cedar has been active for almost 3
years. While many of the technical aspects of the threat are not considered “cutting
edge”, the campaign has been continually and successfully operational throughout
this entire timeline, evading detection by the majority of AV products. This success
is due to a well-planned and carefully managed operation that constantly monitors

Wicked Spider has been observed targeting technology companies in Germany,
Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the
United States, and elsewhere. Notably, Wicked Spider has often targeted gaming
companies for their certificates, which can be used in future PRC-based operations
to sign malware. Ongoing analysis is still evaluating how these certificates are used

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) A corporate espionage group has compromised a string of major
corporations over the past three years in order to steal confidential information and
intellectual property. The gang, which Symantec calls Butterfly, is not-state
sponsored, rather financially motivated. It has attacked multi-billion dollar
companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities
sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who
have publicly acknowledged attacks.
Butterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a
suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple
computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its
attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After
successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before
moving on to its next target.
This group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is
not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead
focused on high-level corporate information. Butterfly may be selling this
information to the highest bidder or may be operating as hackers for hire. Stolen
information could also be used for insider-trading purposes.

Description

Winnti Group is a threat group with Chinese origins that has been active since at
least 2010. The group has heavily targeted the gaming industry, but it has also
expanded the scope of its targeting. Some reporting suggests a number of other
groups, including Axiom, Group 72, APT 17, Deputy Dog, and Ke3chang, Vixen
Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon, are closely linked to Winnti Group.
(Trend Micro) The group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti
group for brevity) sprung up as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black
hats whose technical skills were employed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on
the use of domain names they registered, the group started out in the business of
fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the Winnti group shifted to targeting
gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named data- and file-stealing
malware.
The group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing selfdeveloped technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game
server to illicitly farm in-game currency (“gaming gold”, which also has real-world
value) and stole source codes of online game projects. The group also engaged in
the theft of digital certificates which they then used to sign their malware to make
them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its targets to include enterprises such
as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications. The group has since earned
infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with targeted attacks,
such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and building a backdoor.

In the autumn of 2011, a Trojan was detected on a huge number of
computers – all of them linked by the fact that they were used by
players of a popular online game. It emerged that the piece of
malware landed on users’ computers as part of a regular update from
the game’s official update server. Some even suspected that the
publisher itself was spying on players. However, it later became clear
that the malicious program ended up on the users’ computers by
mistake: the cybercriminals were in fact targeting the companies that
develop and release computer games.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(ClearSky) Over the last few weeks, several significant leaks regarding a number of
Iranian APTs took place. After analyzing and investigating the documents we
conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to
the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently
unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents
and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak
will likely hamstring the groups' operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our
assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months
and possibly even year. Note -most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels
that were created specifically for this purpose.
Below are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:

Green Leakers–In this channel attack tools attributed to the group
'MuddyWatter' were leaked. The group's name and its symbol are identified
with the "green movement", which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential
elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary
guards (IRGC)
Black Box–Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long

(ZDNet) The hacker said that he put up the data for sale mainly because these
companies had failed to protect passwords with strong encryption algorithms like
bcrypt.
Most of the hashed passwords the hacker put up for sale today can cracked with
various levels of difficulty --but they can be cracked.
"I got upset because I feel no one is learning," the hacker told ZDNet in an online
chat earlier today. "I just felt upset at this particular moment, because seeing this
lack of security in 2019 is making me angry."
In a conversation with ZDNet last month, the hacker told us he wanted to hack and
put up for sale more than one billion records and then retire and disappear with the
money.
But in a conversation today, the hacker says this is not his target anymore, as he
learned that other hackers have already achieved the same goal before him.
Gnosticplayers also revealed that not all the data he obtained from hacked
companies had been put up for sale. Some companies gave into extortion demands
and paid fees so breaches would remain private.
"I came to an agreement with some companies, but the concerned startups won't
see their data for sale," he said. "I did it that's why I can't publish the rest of my
databases or even name them."

Description

(SecureWorks) In late 2015, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers
began tracking financially motivated campaigns leveraging SamSam ransomware
(also known as Samas and SamsamCrypt). CTU researchers associate this activity
with the Gold Lowell threat group. Gold Lowell typically scans for and exploits
known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a
victim’s network. The threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and
demand payment to decrypt the victim’s files. The consistent tools and behaviors
associated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that Gold Lowell is either a
defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors. Applying security
updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on
Internet-facing systems are effective defenses against these tactics. Organizations
should also create and test response plans for ransomware incidents and use
backup solutions that are resilient to corruption or encryption attempts.

Grim Spider is reportedly associated with Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider.
(CrowdStrike) Grim Spider is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating
the Ryuk ransomware since August 2018, targeting large organizations for a highransom return. This methodology, known as “big game hunting,” signals a shift in
operations for Wizard Spider, a criminal enterprise of which Grim Spider appears to
be a cell. The Wizard Spider threat group, known as the Russia-based operator of
the TrickBot banking malware, had focused primarily on wire fraud in the past.
Similar to Samas and BitPaymer, Ryuk is specifically used to target enterprise
environments. Code comparison between versions of Ryuk and Hermes
ransomware indicates that Ryuk was derived from the Hermes source code and
has been under steady development since its release. Hermes is commodity
ransomware that has been observed for sale on forums and used by multiple threat
actors. However, Ryuk is only used by Grim Spider and, unlike Hermes, Ryuk has
only been used to target enterprise environments. Since Ryuk’s appearance in
August, the threat actors operating it have netted over 705.80 BTC across 52

Description

The many 0-days that had been collected by Hacking Team and which became
publicly available during the breach of their organization in 2015, have been used
by several APT groups since.
(ESET) Since being founded in 2003, the Italian spyware vendor Hacking Team
gained notoriety for selling surveillance tools to governments and their agencies
across the world.
The capabilities of its flagship product, the Remote Control System (RCS), include
extracting files from a targeted device, intercepting emails and instant messaging,
as well as remotely activating a device’s webcam and microphone. The company
has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments – an
allegation it has consistently denied.
When the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging
hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB
of internal data – including the once-secret list of customers, internal
communications, and spyware source code – leaked online, Hacking Team was
forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an
uncertain future.
Following the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the
company’s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking
Team’s resumed operations came six months later – a new sample of Hacking
Team’s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild. A year after the breach, an
investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking
Team’s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team’s
shareholding. Tablem Limited is officially based in Cyprus; however, recent news
suggests it has ties to Saudi Arabia.

(CrowdStrike) Indrik Spider is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating
Dridex since June 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific
eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to
have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years
of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed
and new anti-analysis features added to the malware.
In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to
have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom
demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an
organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made
BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the
encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated,
the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex.
Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik
Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include
ransomware as a monetization strategy.

Description

(Crowdstrike) Mummy Spider is a criminal entity linked to the core development of
the malware most commonly known as Emotet or Geodo. First observed in mid2014, this malware shared code with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan.
However, Mummy Spider swiftly developed the malware’s capabilities to include an
RSA key exchange for command and control (C2) communication and a modular
architecture.
Mummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular,
Mummy Spider usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing
operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a
new variant or version.
After a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation in December
2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web
injects, it is currently acting as a ‘loader’ delivering other malware packages. The
primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools
for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for
self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute
other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.
Mummy Spider advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time
it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use
by Mummy Spider or with a small trusted group of customers.

We followed network traces and pivoted on the information left behind by this actor,
such as open directories, document metadata, and binary peculiarities, which

Our discovery of this malware family shows the reason for the persistent focus on
hotel reservations as a primary vector: stealing credit card information from
customers.

Description

(CrowdStrike) CrowdStrike Intelligence has recently observed Pinchy Spider
affiliates deploying GandCrab ransomware in enterprise environments, using lateral
movement techniques and tooling commonly associated with nation-state
adversary groups and penetration testing teams. This change in tactics makes
Pinchy Spider and its affiliates the latest eCrime adversaries to join the growing
trend of targeted, low-volume/high-return ransomware deployments known as “big
game hunting.”
Pinchy Spider is the criminal group behind the development of the ransomware
most commonly known as GandCrab, which has been active since January 2018.
Pinchy Spider sells access to use GandCrab ransomware under a partnership
program with a limited number of accounts. The program is operated with a 60-40
split in profits (60 percent to the customer), as is common among eCrime actors,
but Pinchy Spider is also willing to negotiate up to a 70-30 split for “sophisticated”
customers.

Yesterday night, a source in the malware community has told ZDNet
that the GandCrab RaaS operator formally announced plans to shut
down their service within a month.
The announcement was made in an official thread on a well-known
hacking forum, where the GandCrab RaaS has advertised its service
since January 2018, when it formally launched.

Description

(Talos) This threat actor initially came to our attention in April 2018, leveraging both
Western and Chinese Git repositories to deliver malware to honeypot systems
vulnerable to an Apache Struts vulnerability.
In late July, we became aware that the same actor was engaged in another similar
campaign. Through our investigation into this new campaign, we were able to
uncover more details about the actor.

Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 recently captured and investigated new
samples of the Linux coin mining malware used by the Rocke group.
The family was suspected to be developed by the Iron cybercrime
group and it’s also associated with the Xbash malware we reported on
in September of 2018. The threat actor Rocke was originally revealed
by Talos in August of 2018 and many remarkable behaviors were
disclosed in their blog post. The samples described in this report were
collected in October of 2018, and since that time the command and
control servers they use have been shut down.

Over the past month we have seen new features constantly being
added to the malware. For instance, in their latest major update, they
have added a function that exploits systems running the software
development automation server Jenkins to increase their chance of
infecting more systems, thereby generating more profits. In addition,
they have also evolved their malware by adding new attack stages, as
well as new redundancies in its multi-component execution to make it
more dynamic and flexible.

the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective vendors, but
many have been used by other threat actors. Most notably among the dumps were
zero-days such as ETERNALBLUE that were used for the creation of infamous

Motivation

Description

An unnamed source leaked almost 10,000 documents describing a large number of
0-day vulnerabilities, methodologies and tools that had been collected by the CIA,
such as, specifically, the group known as Longhorn, The Lamberts. This leaking
was done through WikiLeaks, since March 2017. In weekly publications, the dumps
were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until his arrest in 2018.
Most of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective
vendors, but many have been used by other threat actors.
This actor turned out to be a former CIA software engineer.
(WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of
leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks,
it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.
The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and files
from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber
Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of
CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012
presidential election.
Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including
malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control
systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which
amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the
entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated
among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized
manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.
"Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking
program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits against
a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone,
Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are
turned into covert microphones.

Description

(CrowdStrike) The primary threat actor, who was tracked by CrowdStrike as Zombie
Spider, rose to prominence in the criminal underground under the moniker Peter
Severa. The individual behind this handle is Peter Yuryevich LEVASHOV who was
arrested in Spain when the final version of Kelihos was taken over in April 2017,
and who recently pleaded guilty to operating the botnet for criminal purposes.
For several years, pump-and-dump stock scams, dating ruses, credential phishing,
money mule recruitment and rogue online pharmacy advertisements were the most
common spam themes. In 2017, however, Kelihos was frequently used to spread
other malware such as LuminosityLink, Zyklon HTTP, Neutrino, Nymaim,
Gozi/ISFB, Panda Zeus, Kronos, and TrickBot. It was also observed spreading
ransomware families including Shade, Cerber, and FileCrypt2.
