Executive Summary
Matrix is a ransomware family that was first identified publicly in December 2016. Over the
years since its inception, it has primarily targeted small- to medium-sized organizations. As
of 2019, it had been observed across geographic locations such as the U.S., Belgium, Taiwan,
Singapore, Germany, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Canada and the UK. While initially
leveraging tactics such as spam email campaigns, propagation via Windows shortcuts and the
RIG exploit kit for distribution, the primary attack vector for the Matrix ransomware family
shifted in 2018 to brute forcing weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials. The shift
to this attack methodology appears to be a recurring trend in similar targeted ransomware
families such as Dharma, Ryuk and BitPaymer.

Matrix Ransomware Overview

When executed, Matrix encrypts user files and network shares, as well as deleting volume
shadow copies and disabling recovery options on the affected device. Like with many other
ransomware variants, the ransom note delivered by Matrix demands payment in Bitcoin.
Instead of spreading through an organization, past Matrix infections appear to have been
more targeted in nature.
Matrix is unique in that instead of delivering a more conventional ransom note that demands
a fixed ransom amount, the threat actors behind it ask victims to contact them directly and
submit a small sample of about three to five files for decryption. This is done so the threat

actors can determine a variable ransom based on factors such as the predicted value of the
victim’s files or the current dollar value of Bitcoin.
As of 2020, Matrix ransomware has been seen appending the following file extensions on
files:
.MTXLOCK, .CORE, .ANN, .FOX, .KOK8, .KOK08, .NEWRAR, .FASTBOB, .FASTB, .EMAN,
.THDA, .RAD, .EMAN50, .GMPF, .ATOM, .NOBAD, .TRU8, .FASTA, .JNSS, .FBK, .ITLOCK,
.SPCT, .PRCP, .CHRB, .AL8G, .DEUS, .FG69, .JB88, .J91D, .S996, .

In addition, Matrix has other variants, including one dubbed “Fox Ransomware,” which adds
the “.FOX” extension to encrypted files.

Conclusion
While targeted ransomware attacks are not new, Matrix is a prime example of how threat
actors can enter into the pool of existing ransomware and cash out quickly by targeting lowhanging fruit. The ransom negotiation tactics used by the Matrix threat actors further
amplifyies the dangerous impact that such an attack can have on its victims, especially given
the volatile state of cryptocurrency value today. Furthermore, this malware family’s shift in
tactics to RDP exploitation, following a similar shift seen in other ransomware groups, serves
to emphasize the need for businesses to stay vigilant on current ransomware trends.
Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents Matrix in the following ways:
WildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.
6/7

Cortex XDR with:
Iindicators for Matrix.
Anti-Ransomware Module to detect Matrix encryption behaviors.
Local Analysis detection to detect Matrix binaries.
Next-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known command and control
(C2) domains, which are also categorized as malware in URL Filtering.
AutoFocus: Tracking related activity using the MatrixRansomware tag.
Additionally, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with Matrix are available on
GitHub here, and have been published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed.
