ShurL0ckr Ransomware as a Service Peddled on Dark
Web, can Reportedly Bypass Cloud Applications

Security researchers uncovered a new

ransomware named ShurL0ckr (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_GOSHIFR.B) that
reportedly bypasses detection mechanisms of cloud platforms. Like Cerber and Satan,
ShurL0ckr’s operators further monetize the ransomware by peddling it as a turnkey service
to fellow cybercriminals, allowing them to earn additional income through a commission from
each victim who pays the ransom.
The researchers’ analysis of ShurL0ckr indicates it can evade detection by cloud applications
where it’s reported to proliferate. Like other ransomware, phishing and drive-by downloads
are their likeliest infection vectors.
ShurL0ckr’s discovery was part of a larger problem: cybercriminals abusing legitimate
platforms and services. The researchers noted that 44% of businesses using cloud
applications were in some way affected by malware. In fact, they found at least three
enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications infected with malware. The researchers
also found malicious scripts and executables, as well as Trojanized Office documents and
image files, to be the most commonly used entry point.

Indeed, ransomware isn’t going away any time soon. In fact, it’s projected to be a
cybercriminal mainstay, along with digital extortion, as organizations increasingly incorporate
emerging technologies to conduct business.
How exactly does RaaS figure into this? It lowers barriers to entry. Typically, a developer will
write the malware, build its infrastructure, then make it accessible to others regardless of
their technical knowhow. This business model continued to boom into 2017, as evidenced by

the 2,502% growth in ransomware’s economy in the dark web. A lifetime license to
WannaCry ransomware, for instance, was sold for just $50 in the Middle Eastern and North
African underground two days after its outbreak in May last year.
Indeed, RaaS thrived in 2017—with the likes of Satan promising easy buck and FrozrLock
guaranteeing “unlimited builds” to Karmen, Nemes1s RaaS, PadCrypt, and Fatboy, touting
premium customer service. ShurL0ckr exemplifies how outsourcing malware puts threats into
more cybercriminal hands, resulting in ever-increasing builds of similar malware in the wild
with varying degrees of capabilities, and constantly fine-tuned to evade traditional security
mechanisms.

A multilayered defense against ransomware
Given ShurL0ckr’s nature, the ransomware can be customized — from the ransom demand
and encryption capabilities to how it’s delivered, which makes defense in depth significant.
Here are some best practices users and organizations can adopt to mitigate threats like
ShurL0ckr:
Regularly back up files and ensure their integrity and accessibility
Keep the system, its applications, and the network updated; employ virtual patching for
end-of-life and legacy systems
Secure or restrict the use of tools typically reserved for system administrators to
prevent their abuse
Incorporate multilayered security mechanisms such as data categorization, network
segmentation, application control/whitelisting, and behavior monitoring
Enable the firewall, sandbox, and deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems
