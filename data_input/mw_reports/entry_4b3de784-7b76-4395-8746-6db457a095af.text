IBM X-Force Incident Response Intelligence Services (IRIS) has uncovered rare details on
the operations of the suspected Iranian threat group ITG18, which overlaps with Charming
Kitten and Phosphorus. In the past few weeks, ITG18 has been associated with targeting of

pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. presidential campaigns. Now, due to operational
errors—a basic misconfiguration—by suspected ITG18 associates, a server with more than
40 gigabytes of data on their operations has been analyzed by X-Force IRIS analysts.
Rarely are there opportunities to understand how the operator behaves behind the keyboard,
and even rarer still are there recordings the operator self-produced showing their operations.
But that is exactly what X-Force IRIS uncovered on an ITG18 operator whose OPSEC
failures provide a unique behind-the-scenes look into their methods, and potentially, their
legwork for a broader operation that is likely underway.

What IBM X-Force IRIS Found
During a three-day period in May 2020, IBM X-Force IRIS discovered the 40 GBs of video
and data files being uploaded to a server that hosted numerous ITG18 domains used in
earlier 2020 activity. Some of the videos showed the operator managing adversary-created
accounts while others showed the operator testing access and exfiltrating data from
previously compromised accounts.
Among the information IBM X-Force IRIS uncovered were:
In nearly five hours of videos, an ITG18 operator searching through and exfiltrating
data from various compromised accounts of a member of U.S. Navy and a personnel
officer with nearly two decades of service in Hellenic Navy. Using these accounts could
allow the operator to obtain other data on military operations of potential interest to
Iran.
Failed phishing attempts targeting the personal accounts of an Iranian-American
philanthropist and officials of the U.S. State Department.
Personas and Iranian phone numbers associated to ITG18 operators.
IBM X-Force IRIS’s longitudinal examination of this threat group’s targeting indicates ITG18
has used its infrastructure for multiple, diverse strategic objectives that serve both short and
long-term interests. ITG18 has been active since at least 2013. Hallmarks of this group’s
activity includes credential harvesting and email compromise operations through phishing
attacks against numerous targets of strategic interest to the Iranian government.

Training Videos
The video files uncovered by IBM X-Force IRIS were desktop recordings using a tool called
Bandicam, ranging from 2 minutes to 2 hours. The timestamps of the files indicated the
videos were recorded approximately one day prior to being uploaded to the ITG18-operated
server.

In five of the video files, named “AOL.avi”, “Aol Contact.avi”, “Gmail.avi”, “Yahoo.avi”,
“Hotmail.avi”, the operator uses a Notepad file containing one credential for each platform,
and video-by-video copied and pasted them into the associated website. The operator
moved on to demonstrate how to exfiltrate various datasets associated with these platforms
including contacts, photos, and associated cloud storage.
An additional action the operator took was to modify settings within the account security
section of each account in order to add the account to Zimbra, a legitimate email
collaboration platform that can aggregate numerous email accounts into one interface.
Through the use of this platform, the operator was able to monitor and manage various
compromised email accounts simultaneously.

Some of the accounts were likely threat actor personas—designed to appear as real people
to victims.

Operator-owned Account Personas
Some of the operator-owned accounts observed in the training videos provided additional
insight into personas associated to ITG18, such as phone numbers with Iranian country
codes. IBM X-Force IRIS observed the “Yahoo.avi” video displayed profile details for a fake
persona, which we will reference as “Persona A” including a phone number with a +98
country code, the international country code for Iran. (See Figure 3)

Other suggestions of an Iranian operator behind Persona A included unsuccessful attempts
to send emails to an Iranian American philanthropist, and potentially two personal email
accounts for U.S. State Department officials in April 2020, including one account that was
associated with the U.S. Virtual Embassy to Iran. The recording appeared to show bounceback emails in the operator’s inbox, notifying them that these possible spear phishing emails
did not go through, though we do not know the theme. The targeting of these individuals is in
line with prior ITG18 operations.

The Legwork for Precision Targeting
Three of the video files discovered reveal that ITG18 had successfully compromised several
accounts associated with an enlisted member of the United States Navy as well as an officer
in the Hellenic Navy. Specifically, ITG18 had credentials for a number of what appear to be

5/10

their personal email and social media accounts – a common characteristic of ITG18, as
observed in previous operations.
The videos show the operator following a similar playbook to the training videos involving the
persona accounts. Once successful access to victims’ accounts was gained, the ITG18
operator actively deleted notifications sent to the compromised accounts suggesting
suspicious logins, presumably as to not alert the victims.
The operator exported all account contacts, photos, documents from associated cloud
storage sites, such as Google Drive, before adding the webmail account credentials to
Zimbra, presumably for monitoring. The operator was also able to sign into victims’ Google
Takeout (takeout.google.com), which allows a user to export content from their Google
Account, to include location history, information from Chrome, and associated Android
devices.
This included gaining access to associated other accounts owned by the victims, illustrating
the breadth of information that ITG18 was able to collect on the two military members.
Amongst the personal files exfiltrated on the U.S. Navy enlisted member were details on the
military unit they were associated with including the Naval base they were affiliated with. The
operator collected a significant amount of personal information about this victim including
presumed residence, personal photos including numerous selfies and a video of a home
being staged, tax records and the contents of a personal cloud storage site (See Figure 4).
Similar information was exfiltrated for the Hellenic Navy officer, including information from a
Gmail account, an account associated with a Greek university and a Hellenic Navy payroll
site.

exfiltrated data from the accounts of a victim (Source: IBM X-Force IRIS)
For non-email accounts, the operator validated credentials no matter how trivial seeming the
website may have been. Some of the categories of the websites the operator validated
credentials for included video and music streaming, pizza delivery, credit reporting, student
financial aid, municipal utility, banks, baby products, video games, and mobile carriers, to
name a few. The operators appear to have been meticulously gathering trivial social
information about the individuals. In total, the operator attempted to validate credentials for at
least 75 different websites across the two individuals.

If the credentials were successful, the operator frequently visited the account details page
first, presumably to review sensitive information available there. Also of note, the operator,
who only used the Chrome browser to validate credentials, frequently used the built-in
translation feature to translate websites in the Greek language to English when checking the
credentials associated with the Hellenic Navy member.
IBM X-Force IRIS did not find evidence of the two military members’ professional network
credentials being compromised, and no professional information appears to have been
included. However, it’s possible that the threat actor was searching for specific information
within the military members’ personal files that would allow ITG18 to extend their cyber
espionage operation further into the U.S. and Greek Navy.

Multifactor Authentication Forces Operators to Pivot
During the videos where the operator was validating victim credentials, if the operator
successfully authenticated against a site that was set up with multifactor authentication
(MFA) they paused and moved on to another set of credentials without gaining access.

Implication for Broader ITG18 Objectives
The compromise of personal files of members of the Greek and U.S. Navy could be in
support of espionage operations related to numerous proceedings occurring in the Gulf of
Oman and Arabian Gulf. It is also worth noting that the U.S. and Greece are strategic allies,
with a nearly eight-decade mutual defense cooperation agreement. Greece hosts a U.S.
naval base in Crete in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Some target types of ITG18 have remained consistent over the past three years while others
appear associated with specific geopolitical events. For instance, while ITG18 has
consistently targeted individuals with an Iranian connection over the past three years, in
2018 the group targeted individuals associated with the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets
Control, a group that implements economic sanctions. This timing aligned with new
sanctions the U.S. was developing as global concessions to extend sanctions on Iran
expired. More recently, ITG18’s April 2020 targeting of a pharmaceutical executive aligns
with Iran’s COVID-19 outbreak, which spiked at the end of March 2020.

Regardless of motivation, mistakes by the ITG18 operator allowed IBM X-Force IRIS to gain
valuable insights into how this group might accomplish action on its objectives and otherwise
train its operators. IBM X-Force IRIS considers ITG18 a determined threat group with a
significant investment in its operations. The group has shown persistence in its operations
and consistent creation of new infrastructure despite multiple public disclosures and broad
reporting on its activity.
ITG18 has demonstrated it performs operations to serve multiple, distinct long-term
objectives that align to Iranian strategic interests. It is highly likely the group has been
successful in these efforts as its operational cadence for harvesting credentials has not
significantly changed over several years.
The discovery also emphasizes the need to follow certain important security hygiene
practices, including:
Use Multifactor Authentication (MFA) – Multifactor authentication works as a fail-safe if a
malicious actor has gained access to your credentials. As a last line of defense, MFA offers a
second form of verification requirement in order to access an account.
Reset Your Passwords Periodically – Don’t use the same password across various
accounts and regularly update passwords. If you use the same password for all your
accounts, it can leave you open to multiple attacks if one account is compromised. Consider
using unique passphrases and more than 14 characters for stronger passwords.
Use a Password Manager – Password managers can generate stronger passwords for you,
and they do not require you to memorize them.

Review settings and limit access to third-party apps from your email – In a few
instances, the operators had to change account preferences to permit third-party apps to
connect with compromised accounts. These settings allowed the threat actor to extend the
access they had to other victims.
