We found malicious apps on Google Play trying to drop a banking malware payload on
unsuspecting users. Motion sensor data was used to evade detection.

We recently found two malicious apps on Google Play that drop wide-reaching banking
malware. The two apps were disguised as useful tools, simply named Currency Converter
and BatterySaverMobi. Google has confirmed that both these apps are no longer on the Play
Store.
The battery app logged more than 5,000 downloads before it was taken down, and boasted a
score of 4.5 stars from 73 reviewers. However, a close look at the posted reviews show signs
that they may not have been valid; some anonymous usernames were spotted and a few
review statements are illogical and lack detail.

We looked into this campaign and found that the apps dropped a malicious payload that we
can safely link to the known banking malware Anubis (detected by Trend Micro as
ANDROIDOS_ANUBISDROPPER ). Upon analysis of the payload, we noted that the code is
strikingly similar to known Anubis samples. And we also saw that it connects to a command
and control (C&C) server with the domain aserogeege.space, which is linked to Anubis as
well.
Besides aserogeege.space, 18 other malicious domains map to the IP address 47.254.26.2
and we confirmed that Anubis uses the subpath of these domains. These domains change IP
addresses quite frequently and may have switched six times since October 2018, showing
just how active this particular campaign is.

How the apps evade detection
These apps don’t just use traditional evasion techniques; they also try to use the user and
device’s motions to hide their activities.
As a user moves, their device usually generates some amount of motion sensor data. The
malware developer is assuming that the sandbox for scanning malware is an emulator with
no motion sensors, and as such will not create that type of data. If that is the case, the
developer can determine if the app is running in a sandbox environment by simply checking
for sensor data.
The malicious app monitors the user's steps through the device motion sensor. If it senses
that the user and the device are not moving (if it lacks sensor data and thus, might be
running in a sandbox environment), then the malicious code will not run.

Table 2. C&C server commands
If the malicious code runs, then the app will try to trick the users into downloading and
installing its payload APK with a fake system update.
Fig 3.
Figure 3. Fake system update
One of the ways the app developers hide the malicious server is by encoding it in Telegram
and Twitter webpage requests. The bank malware dropper will request Telegram or Twitter
after it trusts the running device. By parsing the response’s HTML content, it gets the C&C
server (aserogeege.space). Then, it registers with the C&C server and checks for commands
with an HTTP POST request. If the server responds to the app with an APK command and
attaches the download URL, then the Anubis payload will be dropped in the background. It
will try and trick users into installing it with the fake system update seen in Figure 3.

The Anubis payload
The Anubis malware masquerades as a benign app, prompts the user to grant it accessibility
rights, and also tries to steal account information. Banking trojans usually launch a fake
overlay screen when the user accesses a target app and tries to steal information when the
user inputs account credentials into the overlay. However, Anubis’ process is a little different.
It has a built-in keylogger that can simply steal a users’ account credentials by logging the
keystrokes. The malware can also take a screenshot of the infected users’ screen, which is
another way to get the victims credentials.
Our data shows that the latest version of Anubis has been distributed to 93 different
countries and targets the users of 377 variations of financial apps to farm account details.
We can also see that, if Anubis successfully runs, an attacker would gain access to contact
lists as well as location. It would also have the ability to record audio, send SMS messages,
make calls, and alter external storage. Anubis can use these permissions to send spam
messages to contacts, call numbers from the device, and other malicious activities. Previous
research from security company Quick Heal Technologies shows that versions of Anubis
even function as a ransomware.

Gaps in mobile security can lead to severe consequences for many users because devices
are used to hold so much information and connect to many different accounts. Users should
be wary of any app that asks for banking credentials in particular and be sure that they are
legitimately linked to their bank.
