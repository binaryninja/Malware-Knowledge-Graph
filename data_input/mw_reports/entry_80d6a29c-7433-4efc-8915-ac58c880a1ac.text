CONCLUTIONS
• Ryuk continues to be an active threat as threat actors using Ryuk are releasing newer
versions of this family. The newer version of Ryuk released in June 2019 does not have
any significant changes in terms of ransomware infection code or file encryption
compared to the previous one. The core functionality remains unchanged while adding
features to avoid detections
• The more you pay, the more attacks they will be:
• Ryuk ransomware infected machines of Rural Jackson County, Georgia, in March
2019. It was stated that the county paid $400,000.
• In June, 2019, Ryuk obtained more than $1 million dollars from Florida.
• These type of high payouts will probably encourage threat actors to perform more
campaigns delivering Ryuk and other targeted ransomware
