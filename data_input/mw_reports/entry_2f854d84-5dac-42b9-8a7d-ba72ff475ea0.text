Android Spyware Distributed Via Phishing Campaigns
Bahamut is a well-known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that was first discovered in 2017. The
Bahamut group was involved in various phishing campaigns that were delivering malware targeting the
Middle East and South Asia.
Cyble Research Labs has been closely monitoring the activities of the Bahamut group. In August 2021,
Cyble released a blog on Bahamut Android Spyware, distributed through a phishing campaign
impersonating Jamaat official sites.
The Bahamut group plans their attack on the target, stays in the wild for a while, allows their attack to affect
many individuals and organizations, and finally steals their data.
After their previous attack, the Threat Actors (TAs) behind Bahamut stayed silent for about a year and came
back with a new strategy for their current campaign. The group has continuously kept changing its mode of
attack, and in the past few years, it is increasingly shifting its focus to targeting mobile devices.

During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post wherein a
researcher mentioned a variant of Android malware, which is Bahamut Android Spyware.
After about a year of silence, a new variant of Bahamut Android malware was spotted in the wild in April
2022, being distributed via phishing sites. The phishing sites were masked as genuine websites for
downloading a messaging application that provides secure communication.

The phishing site is well-designed and looks professional. The TA has also mentioned the features provided
by the application, the Contact Us page, and the Subscribe page, as shown in the below figure. The TAs
added these features to the site to make it appear more genuine.

This indicates that the TA has invested time in developing a well-designed phishing website to attract the
victim to download the malware.
Along with the secure chat phishing website, we have observed that Bahamut Spyware is being distributed
through obscene sites “hxxps://www[.]iminglechat[.]de”.
While comparing the old and new variants of Bahamut Android Spyware, we observed that the TA has
modified their code in the new variant and added extra modules specifically targeting messaging
applications such as Viber, Imo, Signal, Telegram, and many more, wherein the old variant of the malicious
app was collecting only Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as contacts, SMS data, call logs, etc.
The below image showcases the comparison and the extra module added to collect information from
different messaging apps.

device

SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW

Allows the app to draw on top of other applications

Source Code Review
Installing the malware prompts the user to enable a few permissions and Accessibility Service. Once the
victim grants these permissions, the malware abuses the Accessibility Service to fetch data from the
targeted messaging applications.

5/11

Figure 5 – Accessibility Service
The malware then checks for the targeted application’s package name. It uses the Accessibility API to fetch
text from the current screen and stores it in a local database, as shown below.

Figure 6 – Fetching data from the targeted applications
Below is the list of messaging applications targeted by the malware to collect the data:
com.viber.voip
com.protectedtext.android
com.facebook.orca
com.imo.android.imoim
org.telegram.messenger
com.whatsapp
com.secapp.tor.conion
org.thoughtcrime.securesms

6/11

After collecting data from these messaging apps, the malware sends the stolen data to Command and
Control (C&C) server. The code present in the below image depicts the same.

Figure 7 – Malware sending stolen information to the C&C server
Along with collecting the data from messaging applications, the malware executes the below spyware
activities:
Collects contact information: The malware steals the contact data saved on the victim’s device and
sends it to the C&C server.

Figure 8 – Malware collecting contact data
Collects SMS and call log data: The malware has a code to collect the SMS and call log information
from the victim’s device.

Figure 9 – Collecting SMS and call log information
Collects files and basic device information: The malware collects the local files stored on the victim’s
device along with the basic information about the device such as model, device ID, version, SIM
operator, etc.

The figure below shows the C&C server and endpoints used by the malware to send the stolen data.

Conclusion
Recently many malware families and APT groups have been observed in the wild attacking specific targets
and performing malicious activities, then disappearing for some time. Bahamut malware follows the same
cybercrime footprint.
Bahamut malware was initially observed last year with sophisticated spying capabilities, and interestingly, it
has reappeared with new additional code which collects messaging applications data used by the victim.
The agenda behind the malware distribution is very clear – to spy on the targeted entity.
Over the next few years, we may observe a change in the activities of the Bahamut APT group, with
different targets, enhanced techniques, and distribution modes.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
How to prevent malware infection?
Download and install software only from official app stores like Play Store or the iOS App Store.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as
PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile
device where possible.
Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Be careful while enabling any permissions.
Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.
How to identify whether you are infected?
Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices.
Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions
accordingly.
What to do when you are infected?

9/11

Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the
Mobile Data.
Perform a factory reset.
Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.
Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.
What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?
In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.
What should banks do to protect their customers?
Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from
malware attacks via telephone, SMS, or emails.
