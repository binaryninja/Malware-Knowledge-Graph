Facebook has recently published a technical paper regarding a threat actor named APT-C23.
Almost half of their report is about a new iOS malware that is in use by the threat actor.
Facebook called this malware Phenakite and provided 2 hashes of malware samples,
however, those samples are not publicly available (yet).
Since I am Android type of person, naturally the Android malware interested me more than
the iOS malware.
After playing a little with the Android malware, I decided to see what I can learn about the
iOS malware, but how? I don't have any sample and I am quite clueless with Apple devices
at every possible level. Well:
We donâ€™t need bombs we got fire kites
Fortunately, the distribution site of the malware was still alive:

Well, not much to do other than download the app, well the link is not directly the app
apparently:

The file is binary, but also contains strings that might be interesting. There are several tools
that parse mobileconfig files, a curious reader might try to parse the file for additional

2/8

information, as this probably should trigger the download of the app after the policy is
accepted.
But now what?
Feeling stuck? no worries I felt the same as well. Since I don't have iOS device to try it out, I
decided to inspect the code of the website:

Oh look at that, commented code, that must be good :P

WhoOpSec!

There was also a reference to a file named app.plist lets try to grab it, shall we?

Ok, this is plain text and simple, the software package is app.ipa, lets grab that as well:

Ah, close, but no cigar, this hash doesn't match the two samples in Facebook report.
Could it be a new sample? doubt it, look at the date. So what is this file? ipa obviously! Not to
be confused with IPA.
Essentially it is a Zip file, so lets unzip that payload:

I moved all the images to a folder to keep only the potentially interesting files from the
archive, namely "app" stands out, what is it?

And that, kids, how I met your malware, e567efd5c800c5b0c6eb5aa0bccc10e9 , I met her
on Facebook, report.
Congratulations, this is the first time the blog actually does what it stands for, sharing
malware for everyone with a hint of analysis. (if you are reading this too late and the
distribution site of the malware is down, no worries, it is also available at VirusTotal as a

6/8

standalone and as an archive)
Now you can enjoy your own copy of Phenakite and start reversing the Mach-O if you know
how to :)

Bonus lol's:
The terms of service of the malware is.... Lorem Ipsum :

The privacy is seem to be borrowed from "relatedcode.com" which has an open source chat
for iOS repository, this is most likely the chat app that Facebook was referring to:

All your base is on fire:
