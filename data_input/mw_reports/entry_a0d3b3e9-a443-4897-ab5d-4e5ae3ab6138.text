An extensive phishing campaign has targeted corporate Instagram accounts since
approximately August 2021. The threat actors demand ransoms from the victims to restore
access. Tuesday, January 25, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Organizations typically focus on traditional enterprise cybersecurity threats. However, some
threats are more subtle, targeting organizations on unexpected platforms. In October 2021,
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified a phishing campaign that

hijacks corporate Instagram accounts, as well as accounts of individual influencers who have
a large number of followers. The threat actors then extort ransom payments from the victims.
The activity continues as of this publication.

Baiting the hook
The phishing campaign begins with a message that purportedly originates from Instagram
and alerts the victim to a potential copyright infringement issue (see Figure 1). The "Appeal
As <victim account username>" link in the message is a shortened Bitly URL that resolves to
an attacker-controlled phishing domain.

The phishing site is customized to mimic the victim's Instagram account (see Figure 2).

Reeling in the phish
When the victim checks the box indicating their objection, the "Go to Appeal Form" link
becomes active. This link leads to a login screen (see Figure 3) that prompts for the victim's
password. If the victim provides their password, the threat actors harvest the credentials and
gain access to the account.

Releasing the catch…for a price
After gaining control of the Instagram account, the threat actors change the password and
username. The modified username is a variation of "pharabenfarway" followed by a number
that appears to be the number of followers for the hijacked account (see Figure 4). The
threat actors add a comment to the profile that "this Instagram account is held to be sold
back to its owner." The comment includes a link composed of a shortened WhatsApp domain
(wa . me) and a contact number. Clicking the link opens a WhatsApp chat conversation
prompt with the threat actors. The threat actors also contact the victim via text message at
the phone number listed on the account and start negotiating a ransom in exchange for
access to the account.

CTU™ researchers identified numerous Instagram accounts compromised by
pharabenfarway, indicating this campaign is widespread. CTU analysis revealed a large list
of domains used in the campaign. Based on the domain creation dates, the campaign likely
started in August 2021. A September underground forum post references pharabenfarway
and advertises hijacked Instagram accounts for up to $40,000 USD (see Figure 5).

Identifying the "phishermen"
Analysis of one of the IP addresses that hosts several of the phishing domains led CTU
researchers to the 'pbfy . business' website. This website appears to belong to Pharaben and
Farway, the threat actors likely operating this campaign (see Figure 6). The threat actors self-

identify as "advanced experts in social media and hacking" and provide their Instagram
handles along with WhatsApp contact numbers. Pharaben's contact number uses a Russian
country code, and Farway's uses a Turkish country code.

In addition to the Turkish country code, other aspects of this campaign also suggest that at
least one of the threat actors could be located in Turkey. In one incident, threat actor
communications originated from a Turkish-language version of Instagram. Additionally, the
page source of one of the phishing websites references the Turkish hizliresim . com filesharing service. The infrastructure associated with this campaign is based in Turkey and
other countries.

Conclusion
Organizations should include social media accounts for the company and high-profile staff
members in their risk assessment models. Mobile apps are a common attack vector. Use of
multi-factor authentication can limit unauthorized access. While social media account
takeover may seem insignificant, threat actors could access email accounts or other
corporate resources if passwords were reused. Additionally, threat actors could abuse
hijacked accounts to damage the organization's brand as further leverage to obtain a ransom
payment.

organizations should consider.
