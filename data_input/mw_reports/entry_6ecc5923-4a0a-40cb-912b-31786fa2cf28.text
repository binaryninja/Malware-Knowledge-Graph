That was quick: Trickbot is back after disruption attempts

The Trickbot botnet looks to be working once again, despite separate efforts in the past few
weeks aimed at disrupting its operation.
On October 14, 2020, the Emotet spam botnet — which is often the precursor to TrickBot
being loaded onto a system — began receiving spam templates intended for mass
distribution. These spam templates contained a Microsoft Word document attachment with
malicious macros that fetch and load a copy of Emotet onto the victim machine. The Emotet
bots reached out to their controllers and received commands to download and execute
Trickbot on victim machines.
The Trickbot group tag that Intel 471 identified is tied to a typical infection campaign that
information security researchers have been observing for the past 6 months or more.
Additionally Intel 471 researchers saw an update to the Trickbot plugin server configuration
file. Fifteen server addresses were added, and two old servers were retained in the
configuration, along with the server’s .onion address. This was likely done as a fix that would
help operators maintain that their infrastructure remains operational.
The fix is another round in the back-and-forth between Trickbot’s operators and the separate
parties that have attempted to disrupt the botnet’s actions. On Oct. 10, 2020, the Washington
Post reported that “four U.S. officials” claimed U.S. Cyber Command was conducting an
operation to disrupt Trickbot. This action, first reported by Brian Krebs on Oct. 2, 2020, was
identified by Intel 471’s Malware Intelligence systems on Sept. 22, 2020.
Additionally, Microsoft issued a public statement on Oct. 12, 2020 that it had taken legal
action to “combat ransomware ahead of U.S. elections.” The legal action involved Microsoft
attempting to disrupt a number of Trickbot command and control server IP addresses that
are in the United States.
The fact that Trickbot has resumed normal operations despite the best efforts of U.S. Cyber
Command and Microsoft shows how resilient of an operation Trickbot is and how much more
effort is needed to fully take the botnet offline for good. The botnet’s operators have all the IT
support of legitimate enterprises — continuity planning, backups, automated deployment,
and a dedicated workforce — that allow them to quickly react to disruptive measures.
“About 10 years ago it was much easier to completely take over or significantly disrupt a
botnet, but cybercriminals are students of takedowns and have learned to make their
operations more resilient to takedown efforts,” said Intel 471 COO Jason Passwaters. “That's
1/2

why every takedown attempt has some potential of giving ground to the adversary. You're
teaching them where the weaknesses in their armor are and they have a team of developers
ready to act on that information. So unless you strike a killing blow, you're not going to
impact them long term.”
While the actions taken this past week let Trickbot’s operators know they are not operating
free of consequence, an multi-pronged effort needs to be made if the botnet is to be fully
knocked offline:
Law enforcement efforts should be multinational and focus on arresting the core
operators of the botnet.
Any further efforts to disrupt infrastructure should focus on the main infrastructure,
not just that of countries where a court order is needed.
Governments and companies should work together on mass “de-infection” campaigns,
similar to those used to eliminate the Bredolab botnet in 2010 and Retadup botnet in
2019.
Whether this is a realistic endeavor in today’s world is another question altogether.
