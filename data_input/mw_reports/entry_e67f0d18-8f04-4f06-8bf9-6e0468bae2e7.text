Key point
On January 2023, a new Android banking trojan appeared on multiple hacking forums
under the name of Nexus. However, Cleafy’s Threat Intelligence & Response Team
traced the first Nexus infections way before the public announcement in June 2022.
Nexus is promoted via a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) subscription a particular type
of cybercrime in which malware creators or distributors provide their services to other
criminals or individuals on a rental or subscription basis. Developers offer their
services on underground forums or through private channels (e.g., Telegram), and their
clients pay a fee to use the malware.
Nexus appears to be in its early stages of development (BETA). Multiple
campaigns active worldwide confirm that multiple TAs are already using this thread to
conduct fraudulent campaigns.
Nexus provides all the main features to perform ATO attacks (Account Takeover)
against banking portals and cryptocurrency services, such as credentials stealing and
SMS interception. It also provides a built-in list of injections against 450 financial
applications.
Despite Nexus being promoted as a brand-new malware, it contains some relations
with the SOVA banking trojan, suggesting that developers adopted and reused old
developments.

Introduction
At the beginning of January 2023, a new Android banking botnet named Nexus was
promoted by a user on multiple underground hacking forums. The following image
represents the original thread promoted by the author:

Following the discussion, the authors claim that the source code of Nexus has been entirely
written from scratch, but it is still in its early development days. Despite this, the authors
behind Nexus announced that it was already available for rent at a steep price of $3000 per
month through a MaaS subscription. MaaS stands for Malware-as-a-Service, and it is a
model used in the cybercrime world to offer their malware for rent or sale to other TAs who
lack the technical expertise to develop their malware.
This model is prevalent in Android banking trojans, where malware authors use MaaS
platforms to distribute their malware to a broader audience. The MaaS model allows
criminals to monetize their malware more efficiently by providing a ready-made infrastructure
to their customers, who can then use the malware to attack their targets.
It is common for MaaS providers to impose restrictions on the geographies where their
customers can conduct attacks using rented or purchased malware. The Nexus authors, for
example, have a "code of conduct" rule prohibiting using their malware in Russia and
CIS countries.

Previous activities and linking with SOVA
Despite the official launch of the Nexus MaaS program on 27th January 2023, our internal
telemetries identified previous related activities behind this botnet, as shown in the following
Figure:

Figure 3 - Nexus activities (Cleafy telemetries)
On August 2022, during the analysis of those samples, technical indicators suggested
some code similarity between Nexus samples and SOVA, an Android banking trojan
emerged in mid-2021. At that time, it was considered a new variant of SOVA, as described in
our previous blog article.
Despite the new MaaS program launched under the name Nexus, the authors may have
reused some parts of SOVA internals, to write new features (and rewrite some of the existing
ones).
Recently, the SOVA author, who operates under the alias “sovenok”, started sharing some
insights on Nexus and its relationship with SOVA, calling out an affiliate who previously
rented SOVA for stealing the entire source code of the project.

This event could explain why parts of the SOVA source code have been passing
through multiple banking trojans. In fact, sovenok identified another Android botnet that
operates under the name of POISON, which he considers to be highly linked to Nexus:

Focusing on technical indicators, the following Figure shows the overlap found between the
commands on SOVA and Nexus. As a result, it appears that most of the SOVA commands
(marked in green) were also reused on Nexus:

Figure 6 - Commands overlap between Nexus and SOVA
Another similarity between Nexus and SOVA is how geographic location is checked.
Analyzing the bootstrap of the infection, it was possible to discover that Nexus implements a
function called preloadCheck() to identify if the victim is actually in a country “allowed” to be
attacked. If the check succeeds, it starts the infection chain. Otherwise, the application
simply terminates the activity.

Currently, countries that are ignored are: AZ (Azerbaijan), AM (Armenia), BY (Belarus), KZ
(Kazakhstan), KG (Kyrgyzstan), MD (Moldova), RU (Russian Federation), TJ (Tajikistan), UZ
(Uzbekistan), UA (Ukraine), ID (Indonesia).

Moreover, another routine is deployed to discern if the victim is eligible to become part of the
botnet. In this case, the attackers try to verify if the official Sberbank (Russia's biggest bank)
application is installed.

Lastly, there are many APIs similarities used by both SOVA and Nexus to communicate with
the C2 server, as confirmed by sovenok.

Technical Analysis: Main features and Commands
Nexus contains all the main features to perform Account Takeover attacks (ATO) against
banking apps from all over the world and cryptocurrency services. In particular, it can:
Perform Overlay attacks and keylogging activities to steal users' credentials.

Steal SMS messages to obtain the two-factor authentication codes.
Through the abuse of the Accessibility Services, Nexus can steal some information
from crypto wallets (such as seeds and balance), the 2FA codes of Google
Authenticator app, and the cookies from specific websites.
Comparing the list of commands of two Nexus samples (one from August 2022 and one from
March 2023), it is possible to note the addition of some new commands, such as the
ability to remove received SMS and the feature to activate or stop the 2FA stealer module.
The following evidence, in addition to some claims by the Nexus author concerning the
possibility of adding a VNC module, underlines the desire to further improve the malware
with new features.

Update Capacity
Nexus is also equipped with a mechanism for autonomous updating. A dedicated
function asynchronously checks against its C2 server for updates when the malware is
running. More specifically, it performs a check towards a dedicated endpoint asking for the
last version; the query look like the following line:
http(s)://C2_domain/lastversion?access=XXXXX&key=XXXXXXXX
If the value sent back from the C2 does not correspond to the one installed on the device,
the malware starts the update process. Otherwise, it ignores the value and continues with all
its routine activities. The update begins concatenating the URL related to the C2 and a key
that will be used as an authorization token.

At the time of writing, the version available is related to the build 7.20.

Figure 14 - Latest build version available
Analysts could use the “key” value to keep track of different custom versions of Nexus, it was
possible to identify a slightly modified version of the malware for each key. This suggests that
more actors are renting customized samples that aim to hit specific targets and countries.

Ransomware module?
According to the information retrieved from various samples, Nexus is equipped with
encryption capabilities. However, this module seems to be under development due to the
presence of debugging strings and the lack of usage references (especially within the C2
command list).
However, we can’t exclude that this function is a “typo” associated with the cut-and-paste
activities that seem to involve many parts of the code.

Figure 16 - AES encryption routine (not in use)
It is reasonable to ask why this encryption paradigm has been implemented. An explanation
could be found in an attempt of making it harder for the user to realize what happened. A
similar approach, even more destructive, has been used by Brata, where TAs adopted the

8/13

strategy of factory resetting the device right after an unauthorized wire transfer attempt to
reduce the evidence.
According to our experience, it’s also hard to think about a ransomware modus operandi on
mobile devices since most information stored is synced with cloud services and easily
recoverable. In fact, as confirmed by sanovek it started to design a ransomware capability in
SOVA, but it was pointless for a banking trojan on mobile devices.

Figure 17 - SOVA author explains his initial goal of a ransomware module

Noisy Logs
Another interesting characteristic of Nexus that strengthens the hypothesis of its
development stage is the number of logging messages spread throughout the code. Those
messages are intended to track all actions performed, and some of them are paired with a
debugging string that contains the message “plz report this accident”.

Figure 18 - Logging strings
Logging messages are not limited to local devices. In fact, it was possible to discover that
most of the messages are also intended to be sent over the C2 communication channel. The
message should follow this syntax: [ botId : Log Message]. However, at the time of writing,
due to the lack of references to the variable botID related to the logging class, this capability
still seems to be in the development phase.

C2 web panel
Once Nexus is installed on a victim's device, it connects to its C2 server. This server is used
by TAs to remotely control the malware, issue commands, and receive stolen data.
9/13

Nexus provides a C2 web panel, which is an essential tool for cyber criminals who are using
malware or a botnet to carry out attacks. It provides a centralized interface for managing the
malware and the data it collects, making it easier for attackers to carry out their malicious
activities.
Typically Nexus C2 web panels expose the login page on the Internet through port 80 or
5000 as follows:

Figure 19 - Management console: Home page
The string “Jojo no Kimyou na Bouken: Eyes of Heaven” references an action video game
based on the “Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure” manga series by Hirohiko Araki, a Japanese
manga artist.
Once logged in, the panel offers the following features:
Dashboard: displays the status of the botnet, including the number of infected devices,
data collected, and any recent activity.
Bots: a detailed list of the infected devices, locations, and other metrics.
Data Collection: tools for collecting and analyzing data from infected devices. This
includes login credentials, cookies, credit card details, and other sensitive information.
Injects: a comprehensive list of 450 banking application login pages for grabbing valid
credentials.
Builder: interface for creating customized versions of Nexus, allowing TAs to
customize various aspects, such as the command-and-control server (C&C) address,
the icon and name of the app, and more.

As the alleged author claimed on multiple hacking forums, the complete list of injections has
450 different targets, which are searchable through the panel. They also offer the possibility
to create custom injections.

Pivoting C2 fingerprints through Internet search engines, such as Shodan, could provide
excellent information, and in this case, it confirms that the growing trend began in the very
first of 2023 when Nexus was officially promoted on multiple hacking forums:

Conclusion
Nexus is an emerging malware that allegedly has taken more than a few “ideas” from SOVA
(a threat that hit the international landscape in the last year). According to the similarities
observed in the code, and the insights retrieved from underground forums, it is possible to
confirm that Nexus represents a new malware, guided by an entirely new group, which was
capable of retrieving parts of SOVA source code after they were stolen by an Android botnet
operator called POISON.

12/13

By analyzing the latest retrieved samples, we can say that Nexus is still in an early stage of
development, still including snippets of code that seem to belong to its ancestor.
As always, the main question here is: Does it represent a threat to Android users?
At the time of writing, the absence of a VNC module limits its action range and its
capabilities; however, according to the infection rate retrieved from multiple C2 panels,
Nexus is a real threat that is capable of infecting hundreds of devices around the
world. Because of that, we cannot exclude that it will be ready to take the stage in the next
few months.
