On Oct. 20 and 21, 2020, just two weeks before Election Day, Iranian actors sent out
spoofed emails to thousands of American voters in Florida, Alaska and Arizona. The emails
were designed to appear as though they were sent by the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist
group, and threatened “we will come after you” if recipients did not vote for Donald Trump.
Some of the emails were also accompanied by a link to a video depicting Trump calling voteby-mail “a terrible thing” and followed by what was made to look like a demonstration of how
to fraudulently produce a mail-in ballot. Government officials and cybersecurity experts
debunked the video’s demonstration, but the video continued to circulate on social media.
Within 48 hours, then-Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe attributed this
disinformation campaign to Iran, alleging that Iran’s purpose was to undermine Trump’s
presidential campaign.

In the past few years, Iran has become increasingly sophisticated and active in online
communities targeting the American public. And its brazen tactics leading up to the election
could mark a shift in the country’s influence strategy toward the United States. According to
the public record, this is the first time that Iranian actors have engaged in an election
interference campaign targeting the United States utilizing stolen voter information in
influence operations.
But to the extent that Iran targets U.S. audiences in sustained disinformation campaigns, it
still typically aims to broadly promote Iranian interests—such as denigrating sanctions
against the country and bolstering their moral standing compared to the U.S.—rather than
attempting to induce a specific result in American domestic affairs. More importantly, Iran is
almost certainly expending far more of its resources on its geopolitical sphere of influence in
the Middle East and North Africa.
As the Atlantic Council’s Thomas Warrick notes, Iran’s influence activities may not be as
much of a shift in strategy as a shift toward using disinformation as a retaliation tactic. Iran
has often engaged in symmetric cyber retaliation, responding to both kinetic and
cyberattacks with cyberattacks on private and public industry. With this strategy, Iran is able
to assert its national power without directly escalating and provoking a military confrontation.
Notably, about a week before the first Proud Boys emails hit Americans’ inboxes, Iranian
infrastructure suffered two major cyberattacks—one on the electronic infrastructure of its
ports and one against an undisclosed target. Regardless of whether the U.S. was behind the
attacks, Iran tends to assume some level of U.S. involvement in cyberattacks on its
infrastructure. So the spoofed emails that Iranian actors sent a week later may well have
been a familiar reflexive response—albeit using cyber-enabled disinformation rather than a
more traditional cyberattack.
Alternatively, Iran’s brash foray into U.S election interference may have been a sign of Iran’s
increasing desperation to escape the maximum pressure campaign mounted by the Trump
administration by supporting an opposing candidate it believed would be a less aggressive
and more predictable adversary. Just days prior to the email scam, the Trump administration
reimposed severe sanctions on Iran, including on its financial sector. Cybersecurity experts
and Trump administration officials disagreed over the ultimate goal of the Proud Boys email
and video, but one aim may have been to target potential voters with a message
emphasizing the connection between Trump and right-wing extremism, a narrative Trump
himself promulgated when he told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” during one of
the presidential debates.
Ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
(ODNI) highlighted the threat of election interference by Iran. During and shortly after the
2016 presidential campaign, the ODNI—and a consensus of cybersecurity experts—were

2/6

concerned primarily with disinformation by Russian actors. But under the Trump
administration, the ODNI shifted its public focus toward election interference operations by
Iran—and, to a lesser extent, China.
Under Trump, the ODNI’s analysis tended to attribute to Iran long-term objectives that most
experts see as closer to Russia’s. For instance, in a widely covered August 2020 press
release, the ODNI announced that China, Russia and Iran were all engaged in influence
efforts related to the 2020 election. According to the report, Iran was seeking to “undermine
U.S. democratic institutions … and divide the country” whereas Russia was reportedly “using
a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden.” However, the
cumulative evidence of Iran’s influence operations indicates that Iran’s aim is persuasion in
the hopes of achieving a friendlier foreign policy posture from the U.S. and the rest of the
world—while Russia’s disinformation campaigns are directed more broadly at weakening
democratic institutions and dividing the American public.
Indeed, just this past October in its Homeland Threat Assessment, the Department of
Homeland Security named Russia the greatest “purveyor of disinformation and
misinformation” within the U.S., assessing that Russia’s primary objective is to weaken the
U.S. by “sow[ing] discord” and “undermin[ing] trust in Western democratic institutions and
processes.” Some former high-ranking intelligence officials have also indicated that the focus
on Iran as opposed to Russia is misplaced. Former DNI Dan Coats’s warnings about the
threat Russia posed were reportedly watered down by the White House multiple times. And
in an interview with NPR this past September, Sue Gordon, the former principal deputy
director of national intelligence—the second highest ranking official at the ODNI—remarked
that she would have put Russia “first on the list” of election interference threats because of
the country’s demonstrated interest and capability.
Particularly illuminating about Iran’s true influence priorities are a series of investigative
reports from Reuters, FireEye and ClearSky Cybersecurity, which uncovered a vast network
of inauthentic news outlets and associated social media accounts pushing out Iranian
propaganda around the globe. Most of the sites in this particular network were taken offline
in October 2020 when the FBI seized 92 domains, which had relied on U.S.-based web
hosting services. However, many of the sites operated for several years before then, and
their structure and operation still reveal clues about Iran’s strategy in the information space
and its tactics for promulgating influence worldwide.
All but a few of the inauthentic news outlets concealed their ties to Iran and portrayed their
operations as originating in other countries. To help create an appearance of authenticity,
fake social media accounts posing as journalists or political figures from a targeted country
pushed out content from a news website to audiences in that country. However, all of the
sites published stories generated by the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM) and the
Islamic Radios and Televisions Union (IRTVU)—two media operations sanctioned by the

3/6

Treasury Department in October for being controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps—which was itself controversially designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the
State Department in April 2019.
Many of the sites also stole articles from legitimate news outlets, including Reuters and the
Associated Press, as filler to make the news sites appear genuine. Some of these stolen
articles were altered slightly to portray Iran’s adversaries in a poor light. Other content was
copied from Iranian state media and used as propaganda to bolster Iran’s profile on the
national stage. Of the 70 websites that Reuters uncovered and the 98 identified by ClearSky,
the greatest number targeted Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan. Dozens of others targeted the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region more generally, where Iran is locked in a
struggle for influence with Saudi Arabia.
This campaign seems to have been broadly aimed at spreading stories around the world that
uplift Iranian culture and the Iranian regime and generally denigrate Saudi Arabia, Israel and
the United States. For example, Nile Net Online, which purported to be an Egyptian news
outlet operating out of Tahrir Square, published several stories criticizing Cairo’s relationship
with the Trump administration. Other sites targeting Muslim majorities in northern African
countries, where Iran and Saudi Arabia are fighting for influence, highlighted Saudi Arabia’s
killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and criticized its military intervention in Yemen’s civil
war. Unlike Russian disinformation, which often aims to create confusion and chaos, this
massive Iranian influence campaign demonstrates that Iran’s propaganda is aimed at
strategic persuasion.
Iran also invests heavily in projecting its traditional state media into other Middle Eastern
countries, where many audiences are more likely to watch television than access the
internet. For example, Iran broadcasts to Arabic speakers across the MENA region with its
Al-Alam station, to Spanish speakers in Latin America with HispanTV, and to English
speakers around the world with Press TV. These outlets are openly run by the Iranian
government and could be properly classified as public diplomacy, in the vein of the U.S.
government outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. However, these outlets have
also been found to intertwine false stories with real ones, mixing misinformation with its
public diplomacy.
Even though many countries and regions where these stations are broadcast hold little
immediate strategic value to Iran, the regime continues to invest in maintaining a media
presence in order to promote Iran on the world stage and combat negative media broadcasts
by Iran’s adversaries. However, Al-Alam, HispanTV, and Press TV are all overtly tied to Iran
and are therefore vulnerable to U.S. measures to diminish their reach, including designations
and sanctions.
More covertly, Iran also spends significant resources funding pro-Iranian television stations in
other countries that are nominally independent. For example, Iran provides funding to at
least four Afghan television stations that create pro-Iranian content, according to one Rand
4/6

Corp. report. Iranian influence over these stations is so prominent that Persian words and
Iranian expressions are used even in otherwise Pashto-language programming. Two stations
in particular—Tamadon TV and Noor TV—have been criticized by Afghan officials and
citizens for their entanglement with Iran. Although both have denied any association with the
Iranian government, Afghan intelligence publicly accused both of receiving Iranian support.
Additionally, both Noor and Tamadon are members of the IRTVU—one of the entities
sanctioned by the Treasury Department in October—according to IRTVU’s website. Although
IRTVU does not discuss direct funding on its website, privileges of membership include
benefiting from unspecified IRTVU services and participation in media training and news
exchanges.
Iran’s on- and offline influence operations and propaganda suggest that its global information
strategy had little to do with dividing the American public to electioneer in the November U.S.
presidential race as the ODNI suggested, despite the apparent attempt to scare Americans
with the Proud Boys email scam. Of course, Iran has also leveraged narratives that are
politically divisive in the U.S., but the purpose is almost always to impugn the reputation of
the country’s greatest adversary before a global audience. Unlike Russia, which often
creates fake personas taking both sides of an issue to amplify discord and distrust among
Americans to undermine democratic institutions, Iranian personas tend to take one side of an
argument and attempt to persuade a global target audience from that position.
During the summer of 2020, for example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly supported
Black Lives Matter in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers. Iran’s
purpose in supporting this movement was not to turn Americans against each other but,
rather, to denigrate the U.S. government before the American people and the world by
accusing it of interfering with other nations around the world while perpetuating injustice at
home. This narrative was apparent from Ali Khamenei’s tweets saying, for example, that
domestic protests represent “all nations against which the US has committed many
atrocities” and “[t]he people of the United States have every right to feel embarrassed and
ashamed by their govts, particularly the current govt.” Iran’s adoption of a single narrative
that directly attacked the U.S. government and U.S. authorities rather than attacking groups
of U.S. citizens or taking multiple sides on the issue suggests that its purpose was
persuasion rather than division.
What approach might the ODNI take to Iranian information operations under the Biden
administration? Senators on the Intelligence Committee have indicated they are eager to
work with the current DNI, Avril Haines, to establish more neutral reporting led by rigorous
tradecraft. A report by the ODNI’s analytic ombudsman from early January gives some
indication of how the agency could publicly report on election interference and reform its
internal leadership and tradecraft processes. The report, requested by the Senate
Intelligence Committee leadership and delivered on Jan. 6, found that internal politicization of
the agency’s election interference intelligence led to biased public reporting on Russian and

5/6

Chinese interference efforts. Although reporting on Iran was not specifically addressed, the
report’s broad recommendations for reforms from senior agency leadership to line analyst
tradecraft policies would likely improve the agency’s public reporting on Iran as well.
