German wind farm operator Deutsche Windtechnik confirmed that it was hit with a
cyberattack earlier this month, becoming the latest in a string of German energy providers
to face disruptions from a cybersecurity incident.
In a statement, the company said its IT systems were targeted by a cyberattack on the night
between April 11 and 12.
“As we previously reported, we were able to reactivate the remote data monitoring
connections to the wind turbines after 1-2 days, which had been switched off for security
reasons,” the company explained.
“We are very happy that the wind turbines that we look after did not suffer any damage and
were never in danger. Deutsche Windtechnik’s operational maintenance activities for our
clients resumed again on April 14 and are running with only minor restrictions.”
The company’s IT team was able to isolate the problems and the company noted that its
forensic analysis showed it was a “targeted professional cyberattack.”
It is still working to restore the availability of all communication channels and noted that the
incident was reported to the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).

The company did not respond to questions about whether it was hit with a ransomware
attack, but it showed up on the leak site of the Black Basta ransomware gang according to
MalwareHunterTeam, an account on Twitter tracking ransomware groups.
Not seen it mentioned by anyone yet, so: Deutsche Windtechnik is also on Black Basta
ransomware gang's leak site. Leak is at 100% published stage already.
Actually, not really got surprised to see this company on their leak site…

There have been several attacks on German energy providers this year. German wind
turbine maker Nordex was forced to shut down its IT systems across multiple locations and
business units after it was hit with a cyberattack on March 31.
The attack on Nordex followed an incident where a cyberattack on satellite communications
company Viasat caused the malfunction of 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany.
Wind turbine maker Vestas was hit with a ransomware attack in November, and the group
behind the attack eventually threatened to leak the data it stole. Like Nordex, the company
had to shut down its IT systems across multiple business units and locations to stop the
issue from spreading.
Oil companies Oiltanking and Mabanaft, both owned by German logistics conglomerate
Marquard & Bahls Group, suffered a cyberattack that crippled their loading and unloading
systems in February.
An internal report from the BSI said the BlackCat ransomware group was behind the
cyberattack on the oil companies.
