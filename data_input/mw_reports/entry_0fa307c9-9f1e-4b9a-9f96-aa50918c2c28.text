Overview
Our Threat Recon team continues to collect and analyze activity-related data from multiple APT groups. We
analyzed malware used in hacking activities targeting organizations located in South Korea, the US, and
East Asia earlier this year. They use a CAB ﬁle that compresses the malware, separate conﬁguration ﬁles
and a speciﬁc User Access Control (UAC) bypass module. This article brieﬂy describes the infection
method of the malware that they were using at the time and the UAC bypass module used.

Infection Method
The attackers used quite a few steps to generate their malware, and the initial infection comes from
malicious documents attached to spear phishing emails. When a user executes a ﬁle attached to the email,
a batch ﬁle for downloading a base64-encoded CAB ﬁle from a remote site is downloaded through a script
included in the document.

Infection method using CAB ﬁle
The following is the sequence of the infection method that they use.
1. Download base64 encoded data 1.txt via script embedded in malicious documents
2. Decode “1.txt” to create “1.bat” and run “1.bat”
3. “1.bat” downloads 2.txt (32-bit) or 3.txt (64-bit) according to the Windows platform environment (32bit
/ 64bit)
4. Decode “2.txt” or “3.txt” to create “setup.cab”
Each ﬁle looks like an SSL certiﬁcate using the string “—– BEGIN CERTIFICATE —–“, but this is actually a
base64 encoded cab and bat ﬁle.

Left: The 1.bat ﬁle used to decompress the CAB ﬁle and run the main payload
Right: The 2.txt CAB ﬁle for 32-bit Windows systems
The CAB ﬁle is created according to the Windows platform environment through the following ﬁles:
1. BAT ﬁle for main payload ﬁle execution
2. INI ﬁle containing attacker server address
3. DLL ﬁle for UAC bypass
4. Main EXE payload

Why does UAC Run?
This malware’s ﬁrst batch ﬁle (1.bat) executes a second batch ﬁle which installs the main payload. A UAC
pop-up will normally be shown to the user and this is caused by the code in the BAT ﬁle that installs the
main payload. It copies the INI conﬁguration ﬁle and the main payload EXE into the System32 folder.
In general, when ﬁles are copied to the System32 folder, a UAC pop-up will run for security reasons. This
folder should not be modiﬁed in normal situations because it contains important ﬁles used to operate the
system.

The ﬁrst batch ﬁle
(1.bat) downloads the ﬁle from a remote server and uses the “net
session> nul” command to verify the current user rights and perform the
following actions:
If admin : Delete UAC bypass DLL, execute main payload and BAT ﬁle
If not admin : Execute the following command using rundll32.exe
Command : “[UAC Bypass Module], EntryPoint [Main Payload execution BAT ﬁle]”.

Batch Code
The batch ﬁle used to install the main payload copies the main payload executable and INI conﬁguration
ﬁles into the System32 folder, and then runs the main payload which was moved to the System32 folder.

About UAC
User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows operating system security control function based on the concept
of access tokens. It displays a screen informing the user when a program requires administrator level
privileges, acting as a warning prompt for user consent of unknown privileged activity.

UAC popped up on screen

How it works
When a user logs into Windows, each user is given an access token. This access token has information on
the security identiﬁer (SID), the Windows operating system privilege, and the access level granted to the
user, and the Windows system uses the access token to verify the user’s privilege. The access tokens
generated at login are:
standard user : Generates a standard user access token
administrator : Generate standard user access token, administrator access token
The system allocates the following integrity levels according to the token privileges of the logged-in user.
System performs access control by comparing the access rights of the security descriptor of the object with
the user’s SID.
Processes that run at Medium Level
Issued tokens are used for events such as
process creation. The important thing here is that
when a process is created after issuing a token, the administrator also executes the new process using the
standard user access token.
Generally, explorer.exe which is the parent process of most user processes operates at medium integrity
level, so most processes run at the same level to explorer.exe. But when a process requires a high integrity
level, processes can obtain an elevated privilege if the user approves it.
This basically means that a process typically uses a standard user access token and uses the UAC to get
the user’s authorization if an administrator access token is needed.
The following such actions are examples of events which trigger UAC:
Running an Application as an Administrator
Changes to system-wide settings
Changes to ﬁles in folders that standard users don’t have permissions for (such as %SystemRoot% or %ProgramFiles%
in most cases)
Changes to an access control list (ACL), commonly referred to as ﬁle or folder permissions
Installing device drivers
Installing ActiveX controls
Changing settings for Windows Firewall
Changing UAC settings
Conﬁguring Windows Update
Adding or removing user accounts
Changing a user’s account type
Turning on Guest account (Windows 7 and 8.1)
Turning on ﬁle sharing or media streaming
Conﬁguring Parental Controls

UAC Bypass Module
However, the attackers in this case use a particular DLL module for bypassing UAC. It seems to have been
created by referring to the source code of a ﬁle named UAC-TokenMagic.ps1 which is open source on
GitHub.
First, it creates a wusa.exe process (an auto-elevatable process) that runs at a High Integrity Level. This
process is the Windows Update Standalone installer, and it has an auto-elevate attribute so it does not pop
up UAC if the system UAC popup setting is “Notify me only when programs / apps try to make changes to
my computer”.
After creating wusa.exe, it copies that token and run the cmd.exe process via CreateProcessWithLogonW
using the copied token. Finally, cmd.exe runs at a High Integrity Level and executes “/c EntryPoint”
%Temp%\[bat ﬁle install main payload]” and this batch ﬁle inherits the elevated privilege of cmd.exe.

Part of the UAC Bypass module code
If the attacker is using the UAC bypass module, the batch ﬁle that runs the main payload will work through
the cmd.exe generated by copying the access token from wusa.exe. In conclusion, the UAC will not pop up
even if the code that moves the ﬁle into the System32 folder in batch ﬁle is executed.

The attackers compress the UAC Bypass Module with other components and distributes them in a CAB ﬁle
format. We have seen this threat actor group mainly use decoy documents written in Russian, English and
Korean and used the BABYFACE, SYSCON malware variants as the main payload. Such activity may be
related in part to the activities of the previously known threat actor groups. Our Threat Recon team will
continue to monitor these Cyber Threat.
