Just a few of the major headlines regarding the education sector have looked like this over
the last couple of months:
Blackbaud Hack: Universities Lose Data to Ransomware Attack
The University of California Pays $1 Million Ransom Following Cyber Attack
University of York Discloses Data Breach, Staff and Student Records Stolen
The past year has seen a rise in the amount of education-related institutions that have been
affected by cyberattacks. In 2019 alone, the K-12 cyber incident map reported that 348
schools have publicly-disclosed that they’ve been a victim of a cyberattack. That’s just in the
United States and doesn’t even take into account the universities and colleges, which would
by all means cause those numbers to escalate.
These statements got us wondering.
Are underground threat actors actively looking for and interested in targeting
organizations in the education sector?
What types of attacks are we seeing affecting the education sector?
What have been some of the recent attempted attacks that we’ve seen in the
underground ecosystem?
Are these targeted attacks on the universities themselves or are they stemming from
access through a third-party provider?
These are all questions that will be addressed throughout this blogpost.

Cybercriminals Looking for the Big Money
At first glance, educational institutions, such as universities, local and state district schools,
colleges, and others, may seem of little to no worth to underground threat actors. However, if
that were the case, it would likely have nothing to do with the ethical factors of attacking
educational institutions – something that was taken into consideration by threat actors
discussing targeting the health sector.

While browsing through various underground forums, we’ve found many threat actors
claiming that they’re not looking to target any businesses that have annual revenue less than
$300 million, or any institutions in the government, education, healthcare, hotel and ecommerce sectors. What do (cybercriminals assume) those may have in common? It’s
merely a matter of profiting maximally. Underground cybercriminals don’t seem to view the
big money from attacking the organizations listed above, and therefore prefer to place their
efforts elsewhere.
Though many cybercriminals seem to stand behind this, we still noticed that there are still a
good amount of them that do in fact choose the route of targeting educational institutions as
they do see potential profits, and sometimes even very big ones. The following section in this
post will dive into how institutions in the education sector are being targeted in all different
ways, causing some of them to eventually incur severe financial costs.

A Look into Educational Institution Attempts and Attacks
From large databases posted for sale, to remote admin access available on auto shops, and
ransomware negotiations, institutions in the education sector have seen heaps of different
threats and potential attacks.
Just last week, analysts at KELA noticed two university databases being sold on an
underground forum – one pertaining to a London-based college, and the other to the
university in California – both sold by the same actor, “Neversec.”

2/6

Following a quick assessment on this threat actor, our team assessed that Neversec is a
rather new threat actor who registered on this forum on July 11. His past activities showed
him selling databases belonging to a Saudi Arabian company and government agencies in
the Dominican Republic, Chile, and Malaysia. Additionally, we found him sharing two guides
for cybercriminals across underground forums, one of them being the StationX guide and
cybersecurity course. In the case of the two institutions listed above, Neversec claimed that
he successfully managed to obtain the databases directly from the institutions’ systems
themselves.
Once we acquired samples and began our analysis, we found that the two databases contain
at least first and last names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. Though small in
quantity – 1,800 records for the California-based university and an even smaller 720 for
London one – we weren’t quick to deem this unimportant just yet. These credentials –
belonging to the institutions’ students, staff, and alumni – can be leveraged for phishing
attacks, something that could provide threat actors with an initial foothold into the networks of
the universities. Once they’ve got this first foot in the door, threat actors may easily use this
unprivileged access to further explore the victims’ networks and may eventually deploy
ransomware or other malware on the institutions’ systems.
Take the case of the University of California, for example. Though we do not know if it was as
a result of a compromise through phishing emails, the university paid a ransom of more than
$1 million. As with any business, cybercriminals must start from somewhere and all they
need is that initial foothold – something that compromised credentials may assist them with.

Browsing further through some cybercrime forums, we stumbled upon a threat actor going by
the handle “maroder” (previously “ailing”) posting access to two university networks for sale.
In his past, maroder was seen selling accesses to various organizations’ networks, as well
offering services of fund withdrawals from crypto exchanges, and even selling dumps of
crypto exchanges. After conversing further with the seller, we managed to identify these
victims to be two major universities, one in Israel and another in Germany.
Selling so called “access” is a rather fluid term and can enable a plethora of different actions
for threat actors, depending on each of their goals. Though the threat actor cannot confirm
whether the access is on an admin level or not, he does specify that this will enable Citrix
access to the universities’ networks.

Translation from Russian:
Selling 2 uni
Israel and Germany
I do not know the rights
People with reputation will give access first
Purely symbolic – 400 $ for both

Maroder/ailing’s activities targeting education-related institutions didn’t stop there. Among
one of his latest activities, from this past weekend, maroder was seen selling Citrix access to
a school in UK with a current revenue of $100 million and more than 500 employees. Since
this was only some days ago, the access again is undetermined however, maroder seems to
be hunting down more targets of this type.
As mentioned above, compromised credentials can be an initial foothold for a larger attack.
However, access to servers either via a direct attack or through a third party, can cause even
more severe damage to victims.
By using DARKBEAST – KELA’s Darknet threat hunting technology – we ran a quick search
for breached servers including the search term <university>, and were left with dozens of
education-related institutions with compromised website access for sale.

Take this web shell access to a university’s network for example. In the example below, upon
purchase, buyers would gain immediate access to run a number of operations against the
university such as editing files, editing the server’s root directory, sending emails from the
domain, and more. This web shell access can grant threat actors several different routes of
attack once they’ve gotten in.

At other times, we’ve seen universities being targeted as part of an attempted larger attack.
On a well-known underground forum, we recently came across a threat actor posting VPN
access for sale belonging to a US-based university, however when analyzing further content
in the listing, most attention was pointing at the potential access it provides to a prominent
US ISP and managed service company – the hosting service of the university. Upon further
analysis we determined the access to this service company false, however would it have
been true, it would have made the perfect use case for an example of something that can be
used for deploying ransomware or other malware, stealing data, etc. Even though this was
purely a marketing scheme, utilizing universities in an aim to attack a bigger target is a
common occurrence.
Just last week, we noticed a threat actor selling access to another US-based university that
was linked to many other big corporations. We found a threat actor identifying as ”EronM” on
a Russian-language cybercrime forum offering access to various organization across
5/6

different fields. This threat actor was leveraging corporations linked to other larger
organizations to maximize profits further than just the university itself. In this case, the
university was linked by domain trust to a large Japanese company, which could mean that
users in the university’s trusted domain could authenticate to resources of the company.
Cybercriminals could therefore leverage this access to compromise the larger company’s
network.

From Russian: “Selling access

Key Takeaways
As highlighted in several of the examples above, threats don’t always necessarily stem from
a direct target on the university itself, and even when direct attacks occur, they’re not
necessarily in an aim to attack the institution itself, rather it may be a part of a larger, more
profitable attack. Nowadays, organizations, are obligated to look out for any potential threats
on their entire supply chain in addition to their direct assets. The supply chain of
organizations, though sometimes overlooked, can offer threat actors the perfect entry point
into organizations. As seen in the ongoing weekly occurrences, institutions in the education
sector are surely a target for many cybercriminals. These institutions should leverage
advanced threat intelligence technologies to monitor their assets in real time, to ensure that
they’re maintaining a reduced attack surface and catching any potential threats at an early
stage.
