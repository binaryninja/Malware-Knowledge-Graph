A new traffic direction system (TDS) called Parrot is relying on servers that host 16,500
websites of universities, local governments, adult content platforms, and personal blogs.
Parrot's use is for malicious campaigns to redirect potential victims matching a specific
profile (location, language, operating system, browser) to online resources such as phishing
and malware-dropping sites.
Threat actors running malicious campaigns buy TDS services to filter incoming traffic and
send it to a final destination serving malicious content.
TDS are also legitimately used by advertisers and marketers, and some of these services
were exploited in the past to facilitate malspam campaigns.

Used for RAT distribution
Parrot TDS was discovered by threat analysts at Avast, who report that it’s currently used for
a campaign called FakeUpdate, which delivers remote access trojans (RATs) via fake
browser update notices.

The campaign appears to have started in February 2022 but signs of Parrot activity have
been traced as far back as October 2021.
“One of the main things that distinguishes Parrot TDS from other TDS is how widespread it is
and how many potential victims it has,” comments Avast in the report
“The compromised websites we found appear to have nothing in common apart from servers
hosting poorly secured CMS sites, like WordPress sites.”

Threat actors have planted a malicious web shell on compromised servers and copied it to
various locations under similar names that follow a “parroting” pattern.
Moreover, the adversaries use a PHP backdoor script that extracts client information and
forwards requests to the Parrot TDS command and control (C2) server.
In some cases, the operators use a shortcut without the PHP script, sending the request
directly to the Parrot infrastructure.

Parrot's direct and proxied forwarding (Avast)
Avast says that in March 2022 alone its services protected more than 600,000 of its clients
from visiting these infected sites, indicating the massive scale of the Parrot redirection
gateway.
Most of the users targeted by these malicious redirections were in Brazil, India, the United
States, Singapore, and Indonesia.

As Avast details in the report, the particular campaign’s user profile and filtering are so finetuned that the malicious actors can target a specific person from thousands of redirected
users.
This is achieved by sending that target to unique payload-dropping URLs based on extensive
hardware, software, and network profiling.
The payload dropped on the targets' systems is the NetSupport Client RAT set to run in silent
mode, which provides direct access to the compromised machines.

Phishing Microsoft credentials
While the RAT campaign is currently the main operation served by the Parrot TDS, Avast
analysts have also noticed several infected servers hosting phishing sites.
Those landing pages resemble a legitimate-looking Microsoft login page asking visitors to
enter their account credentials.

For users who browse the web, having an up-to-date internet security solution running at all
times is the best way to deal with malicious redirections.
For admins of potentially compromised web servers, Avast recommends the following
actions:
Scan all files on the webserver with an antivirus.
Replace all JavaScript and PHP files on the webserver with original ones.
Use the latest CMS version and plugins versions.
Check for automatically running tasks on the web server like cron jobs.
Always use unique and strong credentials for every service and all accounts, and add
2FA where possible.
Use some of the available security plugins for WordPress and Joomla
