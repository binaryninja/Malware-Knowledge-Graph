In one of these moments when those who are supposed to know, don't know, and those who
don't realize what they know

Gpcode Decryptor

aren't reaching the appropriate parties, it's time we get back to the basics - finding out who's
behind GPcode, and trying to tip them on the consequences of their blackmailing actions in
between collecting as much actionable intelligence as possible using OSINT (open source
intelligence) and CYBERINT (cyber intelligence practices).
Great situational awareness on behalf of Kaspersky Labs who were the first to report that a
new version of GPcode (also known as PGPCoder) is in the wild, this time with a successful
implementation of RSA 1024-bit encryption. However, aiming to crack the encryption could
set an important precedent, namely using distributed computing to fight the effect of cyber
criminal's actions. Theoretically, the next time they'll introduce even stronger encryption,
which would be impossible to crack unless we want to end up running a dedicated BOINC
project cracking ransomware in the future. Are there any other more pragmatic solutions to
dealing with cryptoviral extortion? It's all a matter of perspective. More info on the Stop
GPcode initiative, seeking and receiving the collective intelligence of independent
researchers in this blog post :

"Along with antivirus companies around the world, we're faced with the task of cracking
the RSA 1024-bit key. This is a huge cryptographic challenge. We estimate it would
take around 15 million modern computers, running for about a year, to crack such a
key. Of course, we don't have that type of computing power at our disposal. This is a
case where we need to work together and apply all our collective knowledge and
resources to the problem. So we're calling on you: cryptographers, governmental and
scientific institutions, antivirus companies, independent researchers…join with us to
stop Gpcode. This is a unique project – uniting brain-power and resources out of
ethical, rather than theoretical or malicious considerations. Here are the public keys
used by the authors of Gpcode."
Despite that GPcode indeed got the encryption implementation right this time, it's only
weakness remains the way it simply deletes the files it has just encrypted, next to securely
wiping them out - at least according to a single sample obtained. Consequently, just like a
situation where your files are encrypted with strong encryption and virtually impossibe to
crack, but the original files Moreover, instead of trying to crack an algorithm that's created
not to be cracked at least efficiently enough to produce valuable results by have the
encrypted data decrypted, why not buy a single copy of the decryptor and start analyzing it?
It also appears that the decryptor isn't universal, namely they seem to be building custom
decryptors once the public key used to encrypt the data has been provided to them.
So, the ultimate question - who's behind the GPcode ransomware? It's Russian teens with
pimples, using E-gold and Liberty Reserve accounts, running three different GPcode
campaigns, two of which request either $100 or $200 for the decryptor, and communicating
from Chinese IPs. Here are all the details regarding the emails they use, the email responses
they sent back, the currency accounts, as well their most recent IPs used in the
communication :
Emails used by the GPcode authors where the infected victims are supposed to
contact them : content715@yahoo .com saveinfo89@yahoo .com cipher4000@yahoo .com
decrypt482@yahoo .com
Virtual currency accounts used by the malware authors : Liberty Reserve - account
U6890784 E-Gold - account - 5431725 E-Gold - account - 5437838
Sample response email : "Next, you should send $100 to Liberty Reserve account
U6890784 or E-Gold account 5431725 (www.e-gold.com) To buy E-currency you may use
exchange service, see or any other. In the transfer description specify your e-mail. After
receive your payment, we send decryptor to your e-mail. For check our guarantee you may
send us one any encrypted file (with cipher key, specified in any !_READ_ME_!.txt file, being
in the directorys with the encrypted files). We decrypt it and send to you originally decrypted
file. Best Regards, Daniel Robertson"

Second sample response email this time requesting $200 : "The price of decryptor is 200
USD. For payment you may use one of following variants: 1. Payment to E-Gold account
5437838 (www.e-gold.com). 2. Payment to Liberty Reserve account U6890784
(www.libertyreserve.com). 3. If you do not make one of this variants, contact us for decision
it. For check our guarantee you may send us ONE any encrypted file. We decrypt it and send
to you originally decrypted file. For any questions contact us via e-mail. Best regards. Paul
Dyke"
So, you've got two people responding back with copy and paste emails, each of them
seeking a different amount of money? Weird. The John Dow-ish Daniel Robertson is
emailing from 58.38.8.211 (Liaoning Province Network China Network Communications
Group Corporation No.156,Fu-Xing-Men-Nei Street, Beijing 100031), and Paul Dyke from
221.201.2.227(Liaoning Province Network China Network Communications Group
Corporation No.156,Fu-Xing-Men-Nei Street, Beijing 100031), both Chinese IPs, despite that
these campaigners are Russians.
This incident is a great example of targeted cryptoviral extortion attacks, namely, it's not
efficiency centered and the core distribution method remains unknown for the time being.
Analysis and investigation is continuing. If you're affected, look for backups of your data, or
try restoring the deleted files, don't stimulate blackmailing practices by paying them.
