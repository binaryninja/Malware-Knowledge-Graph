Threat Group Uses Voice Changing Software in
Espionage Attempt

April 6, 2021

Today we are releasing a report detailing the activities of a Middle Eastern cyber
espionage group that performs surveillance on their political opponents.
To execute this operation, the group employs well known social engineering methods.
One is to send spear phishing emails with topics of interests to the targets – for example
an invitation to a meeting. Another is to set up websites that impersonate news
organisations and convince targets to download “articles”.
The third method is to ensnare their victims through conversations. As the conversations
continue, the “women” offer up a “video” – laden with malware to infect the target’s
system.
In a more modern twist, however, we found evidence of the group using voice changing
software to enhance their operation. Below we analayse their toolset, which also includes
tools to perform reconnaissance of targets and bulk-deliver malware to them.
The Server
Earlier in 2020 we reviewed a server previously identified as serving malware in targeted
attacks. Those behind the attacks had made a misconfiguration on the server which made
their attack toolset publicly available.
The attack toolset included:
Malware used for espionage against political opponents
Tools to identify vulnerable routers;
A voice changing application;
Custom tooling to use compromised email accounts to send phishing emails; and
Phishing code for webmail logins
Background
The wider set of activity involved in the campaign we analyse below was previously
described by Chinese Anti-Virus companies 360 Antivirus and Rising. Following on from
other recent reporting, we refer to the attackers as APT-C-23.

Whilst there are a number of overlapping groups and members in the region, APT-C-23
are part of a larger group known as “Molerats” and are mostly located in Palestine. They
have been reported on by the cyber-security industry as far back as 2012. Generally
Molerats target political parties in Palestine and the Israeli government – but they also
occasionally target Western Governments. They are perhaps best known for their alleged
office being targeted by the IDF in 2019:

Malware
Others have already reported on the malware that communicates with the server in detail
so we will be brief. There are a number of different families of malware but most start
with a self extracting rar archive. The archives execute MSHTA/VBScript Downloaders
used to install the commodity H-Worm backdoor. The filenames and decoy documents
are mostly themed around Palestinian politics. We have included a sample of them in the
Appendix.

The file ‫ اجتماع لجنة االنتخابات – إقليم الشمال‬.exe (Election Commission Meeting – Northern Territory .exe)
at http://192.119.111[.]4/xx/dv

Phishing Toolset
APT-C-23 are a medium-sophistication group of attackers. They generally rely upon
social engineering to convince targets to install their malware.
They have previously been known to impersonate women and target victims on social
media to lure them into installing malware.
An article from February 2020 describes how they convinced soldiers in the Israel
Defence Forces to install malware. That included using pre-recorded messages in Hebrew
saying “Yes” and “No” – presumably as their Hebrew skills were limited.
“Over the last few months militants, who run the Gaza Strip, have attempted to woo
soldiers on social media platforms including Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook and
Instagram.
Using fake personas of attractive Israeli women, the militants behind the profiles
claimed they were immigrants with hearing difficulties to explain why they could not
speak on the phone, and why they were not fluent in Hebrew.

They also used Israeli slang in their communiques, doctored photos to prevent a reverse
image search online and sent generic voice messages of women’s voices saying “yes” and
“no” to further bolster credibility.
As soon as the apps were downloaded it gave Hamas complete control over the phone:
including transferring files to the Hamas server, allowing access to the phone’s data,
SMS messages, contacts, microphone and camera to remotely take pictures, Lt Col
Conricus said.”
As well as not speaking Hebrew, it’s likely the attackers faced another problem
impersonating women. A number of the people thought to be behind these attacks have
previously been identified. All are men.
That may help to explain what we found in the folder “/up/uploads” on the public server:

Figure 3: The public directory on the server 192.119.111[.]4

The file “88.zip” contains photos from the instagram account of a female model (we have
blurred the photos):

The file “00.zip” contains the installation for Morph Vox Pro, a voice changing
application, including a serial key and voices pack:

The Serial Key is assigned to an “Ahmed [redacted]”:

Given the context of both previous APT-C-23 attacks and the other contents of the folder,
we think the most likely explanation for MorphVox being part of their toolset is that it
was used to produce audio messages in a female voice to encourage targets to install their
malware.
Other analysts have reported on manipulated images being used to enable
misinformation in the wider Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. And there have been previous
reports of fraudsters using DeepFake audio impersonations. But this is the first time
we’re aware of evidence, albeit indirect, of attackers using voice changing software to
enable espionage.
Spearphish Delivery Tool
The server also provides information on how the attackers deliver their malware. The file
recon.exe is used to bulk-send malicious phishing emails to targets:

The application provides advice on how to send the emails, such as the maximum number
of messages that can be sent from each mail provider.
The source code for recon.exe shows that tracking images are also included in sent
emails:

Router Exploitation
Another folder, called “zz”, included another interesting mix of tools:

The file ‫طريقة البحث‬.txt or “Research Method.txt” contains example commands to find
vulnerable routers using the ZoomEye internet scanning service:

The file PingIPs.exe is part of an attack toolset that we’ve seen previously. It was uploaded
to VirusTotal from a IP address in Palestine. It includes a custom GUI and password list
for SipVicious – a tool to hack Voice over IP systems.
Other Tools
The folder “support” contained a credential phishing page for Microsoft accounts. It sends
stolen credentials to https://www.hotmiali[.]com/master/login/login

The malware described in this report is generally well detected by anti-virus, and we have
provided indicators of compromise in the Appendix.
US-CERT provides advice on how to avoid falling victim to social engineering attacks. You
should always be particularly suspicious of anyone you haven’t met asking you to
download files, and avoid installing Mobile applications that are not from the official
Google or Apple stores.
