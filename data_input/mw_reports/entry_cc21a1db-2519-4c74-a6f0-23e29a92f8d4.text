Bitdefender Whitepaper
New TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong

Executive Summary
Bitdefender researchers have discovered a new
TrickBot module (rdpScanDll) built for RDP
bruteforcing operations on select targets. The new
module was discovered on January 30 and, based on
the IP addresses it targets, victims seem to be USand Hong Kong-based, predominantly in the telecom
industry.
Our researchers have kept a close eye on TrickBot. On
January 30, 2020, our monitoring systems reported
the delivery of a new module, performing bruteforce
operations on a list of targets defined and sent by the
attackers.

Key Findings
rdpScanDll:
•

New module that bruteforces RDP for a specific list
of victims

•

Still in development, as the module features a
broken attack mode

•

Targets mostly in telecom, education, and financial
services in the United States and Hong Kong

TrickBot:
•

Lateral movement modules receive the most
updates

•

Dynamic C&C infrastructure, mostly based in
Russia.

•

Over 100 new C&C IPs added each month, with an
average lifetime of about 16 days

Teaching and Old
Dog New Tricks
While TrickBot is a Trojan that has been around since
2016, it turns out that you can teach an old dog new
tricks. While it started out as a credential-harvesting
threat mostly focusing on e-banking, its plugin-based
design has made it much more than just a threat
focused on financial data theft. Security companies
and researchers have previously analyzed a wide
range of modules, proving that the Trojan is still under
active development and undergoing constant “feature
upgrades”.
The flexibility allowed by this modular architecture has
turned TrickBot into a very complex and sophisticated
malware capable of a wide range of malicious
activities, as long as there is a plugin for it.
From “add-ons” for stealing OpenSSH and OpenVPN
sensitive data, to modules that perform SIM-swapping
attacks to take control of a user’s telephone number,
and even disabling Windows built-in security
mechanisms before downloading its main modules,
TrickBot is a jack-of-all-trades. Another interesting
aspect is that, while there are a handful of core
modules, each new module is accompanied by a

configuration file, potentially making each functionality
fully independent.
TrickBot has been mostly distributed through spam
campaigns but it was also seen in cahoots with other
threats. Distributed by the Emotet spam-sending botnet
to deliver Ryuk ransomware, TrickBot operators have
extended its capabilities into one of the most advanced
malware delivery vehicles out there.
This combo relied on Emotet for its huge spam campaign
and effective social engineering, on TrickBot for its
aggressive network spreading capabilities, and on
the Ryuk ransomware for the final payload and direct
monetization. The spam campaigns have focused on
targeting organizations by going after enterprise assets.

New module:
rdpScanDll

•

computerID – is the computer ID used by the
underlying TrickBot sample

•

controlEndpoint is one of the following:
•

/rdp/mode - used to determine what kind of attack
the plugin should use

•

/rdp/freq - used to determine how frequently to
report different statuses back to the server

•

/rdp/domains - a list of IP: Port pairs that will be
attacked (the targets); note that when the port is
missing, the plugin will use the canonical RDP port
of 3389

•

/rdp/over - a list of IP: Port pairs that will be
attacked after the previous list (returned by /rdp/
domains) is exhausted

•

/rdp/dict - a list of passwords to try in the
bruteforce process

•

/rdp/names - a list of usernames to try in the
bruteforce process

•

/81 - used to report different statuses back to the
server (what IP: Port pairs are online or offline and
what username - passwords have matched)

The new module was discovered on January 30, and its
main functionality is to perform bruteforce operations on
a list of targets.

The plugin has three attack modes at its disposal: check,
trybrute and brute.

The modus operandi is similar to that of other plugins.
The TrickBot executable will download the plugin and
its configuration file (from one of the available online
C&Cs) containing a list of servers with whom the plugin
will communicate to retrieve commands to be executed.
TrickBot will load the plugin, executing the “start” and
“control” exported functions, passing the configuration
file as an argument for the last mention function.

The check mode should check for RDP connection on the
list of targets (both /rdp/domains and /rdp/over). To do
that, it first retrieves the frequency, then it retrieves and
checks the list of targeted IPs from /rdp/domains, and
finally it retrieves and checks the list of targeted IPs from
/rdp/over. During testing, we found the plugin retrieves
and checks the IP list from /rdp/over repeatedly. If the
plugin is deployed on a larger number of victims, these
collective repeated checks could flood the C&C server
with requests.

This plugin shares the configuration file with another
module, vncDll, but uses different URL endpoints to
distinguish itself.
The communication with these new servers has a certain
pattern. The structure of the URLs the plugin is using is
as follows:
https://<C&C>/<tag>/<computerID>/<controlEndpoint>
Where:
•

C&C – is one of the command and control servers
from the configuration file

•

tag – is the group tag used by the underlying TrickBot
sample

Check Mode

TryBute Mode
The trybrute mode will perform a bruteforce operation
on the list of targeted IPs returned by /rdp/domains,
and later on the one returned by /rdp/over, using the
usernames from /rdp/names and the passwords from /
rdp/dict.

Brute Mode
The plugin looks like it’s still in development, besides
the inclusion in the executable of a set of functions
that aren’t called, the attack mode brute seems broken.
The brute attack mode doesn’t fetch the username list,
causing the plugin to use null passwords and usernames
to authenticate on the targets list.

Bitdefender Whitepaper

If a host is found online, the plugin reports to the C&C through a POST multipart request to the /81 endpoint with the
list of online IPs. The same happens if the plugin finds the credentials to a certain target. The plugin also reports to the
/81 endpoint on a regular basis, with information about its state. At the same time, it will report to the main TrickBot
executable statistics about the state of the execution and, when it finds working credentials, the username and
password it found for a particular target.
During the analysis of pScanDll module, we were able to retrieve several updates for the lists of targeted IPs (both /
rdp/domains and /rdp/over). At the time of writing, the lists contained 49 IP addresses (/rdp/domains) and 5,964 IP
addresses (/rdp/over). Most of these targets are located in Unites States and Hong Kong. The geographical distribution
of these lists is illustrated below.

When performing a screen on these targets, we found that they fall on different verticals, as observed in the chart
below:

Fig. 3 - Most affected verticals

Modules overview
TrickBot has an embedded list of command and control servers and a list of “must-have” plugins. First, it contacts the
servers to retrieve these plugins, as well as an updated list of command and control servers and an additional list of
servers, used only for downloading purposes. After these initial actions, it awaits further instructions. One command is
to start a certain plugin. If that plugin does not exist, it uses the list of download servers to retrieve it first, then it loads
the plugin and executes the indicated exported function (from the command). As a persistence mechanism, some of
the plugins are loaded automatically when TrickBot malware is started, without waiting for a command from the C&C
servers.
During the last 6 months of close monitoring and gathering statistics about this threat, our systems were able to
retrieve updates for several different active plugins, gathered around different functionalities, proving to have all the
right tools to perform an end-to-end attack:
•

•

Lateral Movement
•

WormDll/mWormDll/tWormDll - a worm component responsible for spreading into the local network via SMB by
exploiting through EternalBlue

•

TabDll - uses EternalRomance to spread into the network via SMB

•

ShareDll/mShareDll/tShareDLL - remote service manager using stolen credentials to install remote services on
other computers from the network

Reconnaissance
•

SystemInfo - collects information about the affected system

•

NetworkDll - performs network mapping

•

Collection
•

ImportDll - collects varying browser information such as cookies or browser configuration

•

Pwgrab - steals credentials from various applications

•

aDll – steals active directory credentials

Setting Foothold
•

NewBCtestnDll – performs reverse proxy and executes commands

•

VncDll – used by the attacker as RAT, giving the option to remotely view and control the victim’s computer

Exfiltration
•

•

Mailsearcher - searches for files with certain extensions (usually document files)

Financial data theft
•

•

Psfin - meant to identify POS-related terminals inside the compromised domain

InjectDll – used to steal financial information through webinjects by monitoring various banking websites

Credential Access
•

RdpscanDLL – performs bruteforce attack on a certain list of targets (indicated by the attacker)

While monitoring the updates of malicious plugins, we observed that the most frequently updated ones were those
performing lateral movement: 32.07% of them were wormDll, 31.44% were shareDll and 16.35% were tabDll. The rest of
the plugins had fewer than 5% occurrences.

Fig. 4 - Timeline for plugin update

Some of these plugins can have configuration files, which serve varying purposes. If needed, they will be retrieved from
the command and control servers. Some of those retrieved by our researchers are described below:
•

dinj – configuration file for injectDLL plugin, containing information about targeted financial institutions; the attack
uses server-side injections

•

sinj - configuration file for injectDLL plugin, containing information about targeted financial institutions; the attack
uses redirections (also known as web fake injections).

•

dpost – also used by the injectDLL module, containing a list of servers; the stolen financial information is sent to
one of the servers from this list

•

mailconf - used by mailsearcher for exfiltration

•

srv - used by rdpScanDLL as a list of C&C servers

•

vncconf - used by vncDLL and rdpScanDll for as a list of C&C servers

C&C servers
Our monitoring systems focused on collecting new command and control servers, both from embedded lists inside the
samples and by constantly checking for C&C updates. We were able to retrieve 3,460 IP addresses, divided into 2,926
command and control servers and 556 servers dedicated to downloading new plugins, and 22 IPs serving both roles.
The dynamics of the infrastructure can be defined by a rough statistic of around 100 new IPs added each month with
each IP having an average lifetime of about 16 days.
Illustrated below is the geographical distribution of these servers. As can be observed, the threat actor prefers
infrastructure from Russia.

Victims
Since TrickBot is a mass attack threat, spreading mostly through spam e-mails, victims fall into multiple verticals and
are spread all over the globe. Telemetry from our Network Attack Defense technology for the last month shows that
most victims attempting to connect to a command and control server are based in the US, followed by Spain. This kind
of distribution usually can be observed when massive spam campaigns are focused on particular geographical areas.

Fig 7 - Geographical distribution of victims contacting command and control server over the last month

Conclusions
The new rdpScanDll module may be the latest in a long line of modules that have been used by the TrickBot Trojan, but
it’s one that stands out because of its use of a highly specific list of IP addresses. While the module seems to be under
development, as one attack mode seems broken, newer versions of rdpScanDll will likely fix this and potentially add
new ones.
The new module also offers a glimpse into how TrickBot operators act. Using an existing infrastructure of TrickBot
victims, the new module suggests attackers may also be focusing on verticals other than financial, such as
telecommunications services and education & research.

all dangers hidden in the arcane intricacies of the digital realm.
