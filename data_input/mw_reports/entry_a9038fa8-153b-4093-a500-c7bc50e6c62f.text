Conti’s Death Notice

On May 19, 2022, the admin panel of the Conti ransomware gang's official
website, Conti News, was shut down. The negotiations service site was also down,
while the rest of the infrastructure: from chatrooms to messengers, and from servers to proxy
hosts was going through a massive reset.

Conti News - a shame blog is the last beacon of the group’s public operation where victim
data was published. It also served as a media tool that Conti used for their endless public
statements (one of which led to the gang's downfall).

This publicity function of the blog is still technically active (and this activity, as shown below,
is highly strategized). At the time of this publication - May 20, 2022, Conti was even
uploading anti-Americanist hate speech claiming the USA to be “a cancer on the body of the
earth”. This, however, only manifests that the website became an empty shell. At the same
time, the crucial operational function of Conti News which was to upload new
data in order to intimidate victims to pay is defunct, as all the infrastructure related
to negotiations, data uploads, and hosting of stolen data was shut down.

The message published today is strikingly different from previous Conti’s political
statements written in properly edited English. The extremely low quality of writing also
suggests that even the public side of the Conti blog is not treated seriously by the leadership

And this shutdown highlights a simple truth that has been evident for the Conti leadership
since early Spring 2022 - the group can no longer sufficiently support and obtain extortion.
The blog's key and only valid purpose are to leak new datasets, and this operation is now
gone.

This was not a spontaneous decision, instead, it was a calculated move, signs of which were
evident since late April. Two weeks ago, on May 6, AdvIntel explained that the Conti brand,
and not the organization itself, was in the process of the final shutdown. As of May 19, 2022,
our exclusive source intelligence confirms that today is Conti’s official date of death.

In this retrospective analysis, we will not only take an in-depth look into the reasons
behind the Conti shutdown but perhaps most importantly, assess and project the
future of a new threat landscape that is already on the horizon. But first, we need
to review how Conti prepared for its own demise, and how this group, notable for its
sophistry, continued to utilize information warfare techniques to orchestrate the
shutdown until its final days, in order to ensure the legacy of its surviving members.

Mr. “R” & Conti’s Final Performance

Shutting down ransomware’s iconic criminal brand is a long and complicated venture. A
notorious and prolific threat group cannot simply turn off its servers, only to pop back up the
following week with a new name and logo design. Even a whisper of novel threat group
activity following the announcement of Conti’s demise would likely spark immediate
accusations of poorly executed identity theft. At best, immediate comparisons between the
two would permanently leave the new group in Conti’s ghostly shadow: the collective that fell
and the one which emerged.

REvil, DarkSide, and countless other collectives attempted the disappearing act; the
simple approach failed, and miserably. As what was one of the dominant ransomware group
active at the time, Conti realized that an element of performativity would need to be
involved. Where other groups had been attempting a grand stunt with smoke and mirrors,
Conti would try a sleight of hand.

4/19

Conti would not be itself without its project frontman - an individual operating under the
alias “reshaev” aka “cybergangster”. Besides being a talented coder (they were behind the
original Ryuk payload), this person was an outstanding organizer. It was “resahev” who set
the foundation for Conti’s dominance in the cybercrime business, by creating an
organizational system based on skill, teamwork, clear business processes, hierarchy, and
clear foresight.

It is not surprising that “reshaev” was the first who saw Conti’s structural challenges - due to
the group’s public allegiance to Russia in the first days of the Russian invasion
into Ukraine, Conti was not able to be paid. Since February 2022 almost no payments
were given to the group, while Conti’s locker became highly detectable and was rarely
deployed. The only possible decision was to rebrand.

For over two months, Conti collective had been silently creating subdivisions that
began operations before the start of the shutdown process. These subgroups either utilized
existing Conti alter egos and locker malware, or took the opportunity to create new
ones.

This decision was convenient for Conti, as they already had a couple of subsidiaries operating
under different names: KaraKurt, BlackByte, BlackBasta. The rebranded version of
Conti—the monster splitting into pieces still very much alive—ensured that whatever form
Conti’s ex-affiliates chose to take, they would emerge into the public eye before news
of Conti’s obsolescence could spread, controlling the narrative around the dissolution
as well as significantly complicating any future threat attributions.

Weekend at Conti’s

“All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem
unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make
the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are
near.”

-Sun Tzu, The Art of War

5/19

This is where the plans for what was left of Conti became increasingly complex.

In order to hide the fact that Conti was now dispersed and operating via smaller, more novel
brands, the former affiliates of the gang had to now convincingly simulate the actions of a
dead brand.

Conti’s remaining infrastructure operated like an army preparing for an ambush. Lingering
actors were left to keep their fires lit, visible from behind enemy lines. Meanwhile, hidden
from view, Conti’s most skilled agents were instead laid low in a nearby encampment, biding
their time while watching their great and empty camp send out smoke signals, meticulously
emulating the movements of an active group.

Conti continued to publish documents stolen from victims (most likely targets hit earlier with
attacks and lined up in a sort of “queue” for public release) and “campaigned” hard for
themselves on criminal forums. Their public persona boasted a strong and enduring
foundation, even one that was willing to further expand the group’s operations. From the
perspective of Conti’s post history, the group was stronger than ever.

However, in order to pull off their ultimate tactical maneuver, the agents left behind to
operate from within Conti’s massive, empty shell had to ensure that their antics would
successfully lure attention away from their escaping comrades. To do this, they had to be
certain that they left bait big enough to satisfy all of their opposing forces. Conti would
have to perform a grand finale—one big enough to live up to the group’s name.

‘Out With A Bang’: Conti’s Grand Finale

And finally, on May 8, 2021, Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves declared a national
emergency as the result of a major cyber attack executed by the Conti
ransomware gang. The massive attack, which took place against multiple Costa Rican
government agencies, seems almost like a last-ditch effort by the group to squeeze a few more
drops of riches from foreign government funds.

However, AdvIntel’s unique adversarial visibility and intelligence findings led to, what was in
fact, the opposite conclusion: The only goal Conti had wanted to meet with this final
attack was to use the platform as a tool of publicity, performing their own death

and subsequent rebirth in the most plausible way it could have been conceived.

AdvIntel has been tracking the preparations for this attack since April 14, 2022
— days before even the initial compromise. Our prevention alert was sent on April 15,
2022, three days before the first incident compromising Costa Rica’s Ministry of Finance
occurred.

In our pre-and-post attack investigation, we have found:
The agenda to conduct the attack on Costa Rica for the purpose of publicity
instead of ransom was declared internally by the Conti leadership.
Internal communications between group members suggested that the requested
ransom payment was far below $1 million USD (despite unverified claims of the
ransom being $10 million USD, followed by Conti’s own claims that the sum was $20
million USD). A low demand such as this, made to a state entity no less, was only made
with the knowledge that the group would never see payment for the ransom.
Conti was very vocal about the attack, constantly adding new political
statements, any and all political statements being banned within Conti as of
March 2022, resulting from private chat leaks.
The attack on Costa Rica indeed brought Conti into the spotlight and helped them
to maintain the illusion of life for just a bit longer, while the real restructuring was
taking place.

Disposing of a Toxic Brand: Conti’s Afterlife

While Conti had been busy with its diversion tactics, other brands such as KaraKurt,
BlackByte, and numerous other groups which existed as extensions of Conti but without
taking the group’s name were extremely operationally active, although they worked in
silence. Working concurrently with them, talented infiltration specialists, who were
13/19

ultimately the backbone of Conti’s gang, were also more active than ever, forming alliances
with BlackCat, AvosLocker, HIVE, HelloKitty/FiveHands, and a whole other cadre of
ransomware groups. These pen-testers maintain personal loyalty to the people who
created Conti but ultimately continued their work with other gangs in order to finally shed
Conti’s name and image.

This situation presents the first, and foremost reason for Conti’s timely end—toxic
branding. Indeed, the first two months of 2022 left a major mark on the Conti name. While
there is no tangible evidence to suggest that the well-known Conti leaks had any impact on
the group’s operations, the event which provoked the leak— Conti’s claim to support the
Russian government, seems to have been the fatal blow for the group, despite being
revoked almost immediately.
The statement had several key
consequences, all of which
completely reshaped the
environment Conti was operating
within.
First, by engaging in
political discourse, Conti
broke the first unspoken rule
of the Russian-speaking
cybercrime community—not
to intervene in state
matters.
In AdvIntel’s public
blogregarding REvil’s ultimate
takedown by the Russian
government, AdvIntel provided an
in-depth analysis of this unspoken
agreement, making case studies of
the two most notable groups to
break it—Avaddon and REvil. With the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, it may be
very plausible that Russia’s state security apparatus is attempting to exert
governmental control over its cyberspace, even taking down groups that appear to
have been allies, but who exhibited undue independence with their actions.

14/19

AdvIntel had seen internal
communication of the Conti
leadership suggesting that the
Russian FSB had been pressuring
the group, and even though nonfactual evidence was involved, the
REvil scenario may have
simply repeated itself with
Conti, the group’s brand
becoming a target for Russian
authorities despite their
pledged loyalties.
Second, Conti’s allegiance
to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine provoked
internal conflict, and
brought shame on the
Conti name from members
who were either ethnically
Ukrainian, or were Russian
but supported Ukraine, or simply wanted to maintain an anti-war ethic.
Considering that one of these members decided to betray the gang and leak private Conti
chat logs not long after, this conflict illustrated the final nail in Conti’s self-made coffin:
The third, and most important factor—by pledging their allegiance to the Russian
government, Conti as a brand became associated with the Russian state—a
state that is currently undergoing extreme sanctions.
In the eyes of the state, each ransom payment going to Conti may have potentially gone to an
individual under sanction, turning simple data extortion into a violation of OFAC regulation
and sanction policies against Russia. This liability came to a head on May 6, 2022, whenthe
US State Department offered rewards up to $10 million USD for information
that led to the takedown of the Conti group.

Conti decided to revoke their support of the Russian government immediately, turning it
into an anti-war statement backed by anti-western sentiments, but this did not repair the
damage that had been done to their reputation. [Source]

As a result of these limitations, Conti had essentially cut itself from the main source of
income. Our sensitive source intelligence shows that many victims were prohibited to pay
ransom to Conti. Other victims and companies who would have negotiated
ransomware payments were more ready to risk the financial damage of not
paying the ransom than they were to make payments to a state-sanctioned
entity.

The Villian With a Thousand Faces
16/19

17/19

As AdvIntel previously stated, the end of the Conti brand does not equal the end
of Conti as an organization. As seen with the Costa Rica case, Conti has been planning
the rebranding for several months and prepared a comprehensive strategy to execute it. This
strategy is based on two pillars:

First, Conti is adopting a network organizational structure, more horizontal and
decentralized than the previously rigid Conti hierarchy. This structure will be a coalition of
several equal subdivisions, some of which will be independent, and some existing within
another ransomware collective. However, they will all be united by internal loyalty to
both each other and the Conti leadership, especially “reshaev”.

At this point, this network includes the following groups:

TYPE1. Fully autonomous: No locker involved, pure data-stealing:
Karakurt
BlackBasta
BlackByte
TYPE2. Semi-autonomous: Acting as Conti-loyal collective affiliates within
other collectives in order to use their locker:
AlphV/BlackCat
HIVE
HelloKitty/FiveHands
AvosLocker
TYPE3. Independent affiliates: Working individually, but keeping their loyalty
to the organization

TYPE4. Mergers & Acquisitions: Conti leadership infiltrates an already-existing small
brand and consumes it entirely, keeping the small brand name. The small group's leader
loses independence, but receives a massive influx of manpower, while Conti receives a new

18/19

subsidiary group. (for this type, Groups’ names are obfuscated for security
reasons. Please contact AdvIntel with questions).

This is different from Ransomware-as-a-Service, since this network, at least at the time of
writing, does not seem to be accepting new members as part of its structure. Moreover,
unlike RaaS, this model seems to value operations being executed in an organized, team-led
manner. Finally, unlike RaaS, all the members know each other very well personally and are
able to leverage these personal connections and the loyalty that comes with them.

This model is more flexible and adaptive than the previous Conti hierarchy but
is more secure and resilient than RaaS.

The other major development for this new ransomware model is the transition from data
encryption to data exfiltration, covered extensively by AdvIntel in our analysis of
Karakurt and BlackByte. In a nutshell, relying on pure data exfiltration maintains most major
benefits of a data encryption operation, while avoiding the issues of a locker altogether. Most
likely, this will become the most important outcome of Conti's re-brand.

Conclusion

Within the short but tumultuous timeline of ransomware’s history, May 19, 2022, the day
that Conti died, will leave a mark that severs the threat landscape from its past and casts a
shadow on its future. However, in the grand scheme of the group’s existence, this day is not
something new.

Looking back, a trail of similar marks lead from the group’s days as the organization Ryuk to
their first rebranding from the collective’s Overdose division. Each mark represents a shift in
the threat landscape, a series of tics that, only when viewed from a great distance, show the
dramatic impact the group has made on ransomware’s very existence. However, the actors
that formed and worked under the Conti name have not, and will not cease to move forward
with the threat landscape—their impact will simply leave a different shape.
