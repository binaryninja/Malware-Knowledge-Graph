In this free research report, we analyze Quasar RAT which has been widely leveraged by
multiple threat actor groups targeting both government and private organizations in
Southeast Asia and other geographies.
Quasar RAT (aka: CinaRAT, Yggdrasil) is an open-source remote access trojan (RAT) that
has been widely adopted by bad actors due to its powerful techniques. Quasar RAT has
been behind multiple attack campaigns by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and
most recently, a Chinese threat group APT10 was observed using it for targeted attacks.
The intelligence in this report can be used by SOC analysts, threat hunting teams,
cyberthreat intelligence analysts, and digital forensics teams.
This complementary paper examines the evolution of the Quasar RAT payload, unpacks its
configuration, details a technical analysis of the malware payload, and finally presents
possible detection parameters using Qualys Multi-Vector EDR.
