documents with malicious VBA macros in the past. However, over the past two weeks we are seeing
these malicious VBA macros leveraged to drop Kasidet backdoor in addition to Dridex on the infected
systems. These malicious Office documents are being spread as an attachment using spear phishing
emails as described here. The malicious macro inside the Office document is obfuscated as shown in
the code snapshot below -

In this blog, we will provide a detailed analysis for the Kasidet variant that we spotted in this campaign.

Kasidet installs itself into %APPDATA% folder. It creates a new folder there with the name

"Y1FeZFVYXllb", this string is hardcoded in the malware. The same string is used as mutex name and

Information Stealing capabilities:

BA (1)
Kasidet uses following two methods for stealing information from the victim's machine:

backdoor (3)
Baidu Search (1)
Banking Trojan (6)

1. Memory Scraping – This allows Kasidet to steal credit card data from the memory of Point-Of-Sale
(POS) systems. It scans the memory of all the running processes except the operating system
processes listed below:

Base64 encode/decode (5)
bash (2)
BatteryBotPro (1)

System

Bedep (3)

smss.exe
csrss.exe

black friday (1)

winlogon.exe

blackhole (4)

lsass.exe

BlueBotnet (1)

spoolsv.exe

Botnet (3)

devenv.exe

botnets (10)
browser (1)

The stolen information is relayed back to the attacker using following URI format –

captcha (2)
certificates (1)

d=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&type=<Track1 or Track2 data>&data=<stolen data>&p=
< Process elevation status >

Chanitor (1)
Chinese APT (1)
Chinese malware (4)

2. Browser Hooking – This allows Kasidet to steal data from Web browsers. It can inject code into

Clear text authentication (5)

FireFox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer (IE). Browser names are not saved in plain text and instead this

Clicker (1)

variant uses the same hash function as used by Carberp malware to encrypt the browser names. The

ClickFaud (1)

following APIs are hooked in the web browser for stealing sensitive data:

ClickFraud (1)

Browser
FireFox
Chrome
IE

API
PR_Write
WSASend
H pSendRequestW , InternetWriteFile

The stolen information is relayed back to the attacker using following URI format –

cloud (3)
Cloud Services (1)
CNN App (1)
Compromised (25)
Compromised WordPress (2)
Confidentiality (1)
credentials leak (1)

ff=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&host=<Base64 encoded host name>&form=< Base64

crypt4 (1)

encoded HTTP header data>&browser=<Browser name>

CryptoWall (3)

The information stealing feature of this Kasidet variant were deactivated if the system locale or
GeoUserID corresponds to Russia.
Network communication:

CryptoWall 3.0 (1)

CVE-2013-0074 (2)

Kasidet contains a hardcoded list of Command & Control (C&C) server locations. It uses

Kasidet C&C list

dynamic DNS (1)

Upon successful infection, Kasidet sends a HTTP POST request with data “enter=1” (without quotes).

Dyre (1)

All HTTP header fields (User-Agent, Content-type and Cookie) are hard coded in the payload itself.

Conclusion

MultiPlug (1)

Malicious Office document file is a popular vector for malware authors to deliver their payloads. Dridex
authors have leveraged this technique for over a year and it was interesting to see the same campaign
and URLs being leveraged to deliver Kasidet payloads. While this does not establish any links between
the two malware family authors, it reaffirms the fact that a lot of the underlying infrastructure and delivery
mechanisms are often shared by these cyber criminals.
